Socially Responsible Investing For Dummies 
xviii

Introduction
D
oing well while doing good. That’s the goal — and the cliché — of socially 
responsible investing. Investing can help you reach major personal goals: 
retirement, college education for your children, charitable donations. Socially 
responsible investing allows you to take care of your finances while being 
true to your values. It can encourage companies and governments to operate 
cleanly and ethically, and it can help improve the community where you live. 
It’s becoming popular because investing is one way to take action to make the 
world better.
Done incorrectly, socially responsible investing is nothing but window 
dressing. It sometimes emphasizes feeling good over making money or making 
a difference in the world. That’s unfortunate. Savvy socially responsible 
investors, which include major university endowments and pension funds, 
understand that socially responsible investing isn’t separate from good 
investing. You don’t need to compromise your finances or your goals when 
you invest socially.
Socially Responsible Investing For Dummies tells you what you need to know 
to invest better. I start out with facts on why and how social investing works. 
I tell you how to do research so you can determine whether an investment 
is a good one for you in terms of financial potential and your personal needs. 
I explain how to use your investment clout to influence a company’s 
performance for the better. I cover the different ways that investors define 
social responsibility to help you clarify your own goals. And I lay out the 
different types of investments that you can use to put your plan into action. I 
also include some information on how to find brokers, financial planners, and 
mutual fund companies that can help you with your decisions.
This book is designed to get you started. You may want more information on 
different types of investments and investment techniques, or you may want 
to research a particular type of social investing in greater depth than I cover 
here. That’s fine. I have plenty of references in the book to help you figure 
out where to go next.

Socially Responsible Investing For Dummies 
About This Book
Let me tell you what this book is not: It’s not a textbook, nor is it a religious 
tract. If you want to know more about the theory and mechanics of the 
market, you can find lots of great texts in a college bookstore. If it’s important 
to your mortal soul to do precisely the right thing, see your clergy person for 
guidance. I went to business school, not the seminary!
This book is designed to be simple. It assumes that you don’t know much 
about investing, but that you’re a smart person who wants to find out more 
about doing it right. And so it has straightforward explanations of what you 
need to know to understand how investing can be socially responsible, how 
to identify your concerns and do research to address them, and what the 
alternatives are for your portfolio.
If you want to read some textbooks or religious works, I list a few in the 
appendix.
Conventions Used in This Book
I put important words that I define in italic font. I often bold the key words 
of bulleted or numbered lists to bring the important ideas to your attention. 
And I place all Web addresses in monofont for easy access.
I cover investment research in this book, and I introduce you to some techni-
cal terms that will come up in the investment world. You don’t need to know 
all this information to be a successful social investor, but I think it’s helpful 
to show the array of possibilities to help you identify what may suit you. 
Sometimes I throw in references to deeper academic investment theories. To 
alert you to these topics, I often place them under a Technical Stuff icon (see 
the section “Icons Used in This Book”).
During printing of this book, some of the Web addresses may have broken 
across two lines of text. If you come across such an address, rest assured 
that I haven’t put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the 
break. When using a broken Web address, type in exactly what you see on 
the page, pretending that the line break doesn’t exist.

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
I include sidebars (the gray boxes containing a heading and a couple of 
paragraphs) in the book that you don’t really need to read to follow the 
chapter text. With that stated, though, I do encourage you to go back and 
read through the material when you have time. Many of the sidebars contain 
examples that help you get an even better idea of how some of the investment 
concepts work!
You can also skip the text marked with a Technical Stuff icon, but see the 
preceding section for an explanation of why you may not want to skim over 
this material.
Foolish Assumptions
The format of my summa opus requires me to make some assumptions about 
you, the reader:
 
✓ You need to know a lot about social investing in a short period of time.
 
✓ You may be starting a college fund for a new baby, planning for your 
retirement, or trying to decide how best to manage a windfall.
 
✓ Maybe you’ve volunteered for your church’s finance committee or were 
elected to your union’s pension board, and you want to make smart 
decisions that reflect the organization’s values.
 
✓ You may be an experienced investor who wants to use your accumu-
lated funds and market savvy to change the world, or at least your 
neighborhood.
 
✓ You have money to invest, even just a little to start with, and you want 
to generate a good return as well as goodwill.
Although some readers may have investing experience, I’m assuming that 
most are new to the concepts. Maybe you’ve been afraid to invest because 
you worry that doing so will contribute to the world’s worst problems.
No matter your situation or motives, my goal is to give you enough information 
so you can ask smart questions, do careful research, and handle your money 
so you can meet your goals.

Socially Responsible Investing For Dummies 
I’m also assuming that the world will continue to change constantly and the 
social issues that matter to you will change, too. That’s why much of this 
book emphasizes research. As new issues emerge, you’ll be prepared to find 
investments that will — and will not — work for you. I’m assuming that you 
want to take responsibility for your money and for your place in the world.
How This Book Is Organized
Socially Responsible Investing For Dummies is sorted into parts so you can 
find what you need to know quickly. The following sections break down the 
book’s structure.
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing
The first part describes what socially responsible investing is, how it works, 
and how to do research to determine whether an investment is socially 
responsible. It also includes information about the performance of socially 
responsible businesses and of investors who apply this philosophy to show 
you that it does make a difference.
Part II: Issues to Invest In
Not all socially responsible investors are alike. Some care about the environ-
ment. Some care about the community where they live. Some want to follow 
the precepts of their religion. Some simply want corporate executives to live 
up to their fiduciary responsibilities. In this part, I describe the different ways 
that people think about social investing to help you determine what’s most 
important to you. That way, you can better direct your investments.
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible 
Choices into Action
This part is all about the different asset classes that you can invest in. 
Some will help you meet specific social and investment goals; others can be 
socially responsible if used appropriately. You can find information about 
how to buy and sell, where to look, and what to watch out for, whether you’re 
buying commercial real estate or a mutual fund.

5
 Introduction
The information here can help you make better portfolio decisions, even if 
you’re not fully committed to being socially responsible or don’t have a lot of 
money to invest right now. Given how often circumstances change and new 
investment products come to market, you can use the material in this part to 
adjust your portfolio as needed.
Part IV: The Part of Tens
In this For Dummies-only part, you get to enjoy some top-ten lists. I present 
ten tips for social investors, ten traps that they sometimes fall into (but that 
you, I’m sure, will not), and ten success stories of change that happened 
in part due to the work of social and activist investors. I also include an 
appendix full of references so you can get more information if you desire.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see four icons scattered around the margins of the text. Each icon 
points to information you should know or may find interesting about social 
investing. They go as follows:
 
This icon notes something you should keep in mind about social investing. It 
may refer to something I’ve already covered in the book, or it may highlight 
something you need to know for future investing decisions!
 
Tip information tells you how to invest a little better, a little smarter, a little 
more efficiently. The information can help you make better decisions about 
how an investment is socially responsible or ask better questions of people 
who are offering you investment opportunities.
 
I include nothing in this book that can cause death or bodily harm, as far as I can 
figure out, but plenty of things in the world of investing can cause you to lose big 
money or, worse, your sanity. These points help you avoid big problems.
 
I put the boring (but sometimes helpful) academic stuff here. By reading this 
material, you get the detailed information behind the investment theories, or 
you can get some interesting trivia or background information.

Socially Responsible Investing For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
Are you ready to open up the book and get going? Allow me to give you 
some ideas. You may want to start with Chapter 1 if you know nothing about 
socially responsible investing so you can get a good sense of what I’m talking 
about. If you need help convincing someone else that social investing works, 
look at Chapters 2 and 3. If you want to find out how to do research and put it 
into action, check out Chapters 4 and 5. If you need to figure out what issues 
you want to emphasize, look at Chapters 6 through 11. Those chapters get 
you started.
If you’re already on board with the idea of social investing and want to turn 
your values into action, go straight to Part III. Chapters 12 through 16 cover 
investing alternatives from bank accounts to hedge funds. In Chapter 17, you 
can get the lowdown about microfinance and venture philanthropy, where 
the returns may be lower but the global payoffs larger.

Part I
Getting Started in 
Social Investing

In this part . . .
S
ocial investors want to make money and make a dif-
ference in the world while staying true to their 
beliefs. The process is similar to regular investing, but it 
does have a few differences. Instead of doing research 
only on a company’s growth prospects, a social investor 
looks for additional information on what the business is 
doing to get that growth. Instead of waiting for manage-
ment to deliver results, the social investor may push the 
managers for changes. In this part, you discover the 
basics of investing, social style.

Chapter 1
Investing the Socially 
Responsible Way
In This Chapter
▶ Getting a good return on your money
▶ Evaluating research
▶ Deciding to invest responsibly
▶ Using your money to influence change
▶ Making smart investments
W
henever I mentioned to people that I was writing Socially Responsible 
Investing For Dummies, they’d get excited. “Wow!” they’d say. “I’d love 
to know more about how to do good through investing.” And that’s probably 
what you had in mind when you picked up this book.
Very quickly, though, I realized that each of these people defined “doing good 
through investing” a little bit differently. Some people want to change the 
world; they want to be part of new technologies and new ideas that could make 
our society better in the years to come. Some want to avoid businesses that 
produce products that they disapprove of. And some want to make sure that 
they aren’t undermining their charitable activities with their investments.
Socially responsible investing can help you put your money to work financing 
activities that you support. It can also help you avoid businesses that you’d 
rather not deal with. Done right, your performance should be no different 
than if you invested without regard to social responsibility; it helps that more 
companies are trying to be responsible with their businesses. As the number 
of social investors grows, maybe even more companies will change how they 
operate.
This book is a guide to figuring out whether an investment is responsible. 
If you can do that, you can be a responsible investor all your life, no matter 
how your finances and social priorities change.

10
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
Social Investing DOES 
Give a Good Return
Have a laundry list of things that bother you about the world? Think 
companies should treat workers and suppliers better, meet relevant 
government regulations without prompting, and make better products? Well, 
you may be able to ease some of your troubles through a socially responsible 
investing approach. Even better, you may be encouraging more companies to 
do the right thing. And contrary to popular belief, this sort of investing does 
pay off.
A lot of people who work in financial services think that social investing is 
nice if you don’t care about return. They’ll suggest that you instead follow a 
standard, nonjudgmental investment strategy, and then give the extra profits 
to charity.
Some social investors say they’re happy giving up a little bit of return if they 
feel good about where their money is. To use the fancy terms of economic 
theory, this is a utilitarian argument: These investors get “utility” from their 
investment in addition to the money that they make, so they’re just as happy 
as an investor who gets all return and no utility.
I really wish I could tell you that both of these arguments are wrong and that 
social investors make more money than others. But what I know is that both 
of those arguments are wrong because the evidence is that social investors 
can make as much money as others — and get their added utility, too. The 
keys to success seem to be carefully selecting asset classes and using activist 
techniques to boost returns. This book contains plenty of examples in sup-
port of successful social investing.
 
Many financial theorists believe that markets are efficient. They say that any 
investment is as likely as another to outperform the market; you could throw 
a dart at the pages of the Wall Street Journal to pick stocks that would be 
no better or no worse than any a fancy professional would pick. There are 
some problems with the idea of market efficiency, but it’s true enough that it 
explains why a social portfolio is likely to be no better or no worse than any 
other.

11
 Chapter 1: Investing the Socially Responsible Way
Yes, Responsible Behavior 
Does Help Businesses
Following socially responsible principles can help many organizations thrive. 
Can it get them the proverbial win-win, where it does better for shareholders 
by doing better by society as a whole? There’s a whole lot of research on that 
very topic.
In general, companies can do well by doing good; just how good they have to 
be and how well they can do is subject to a bit of debate. (But debate is good! 
That’s what makes markets, as the traders like to say.) A review of some 
recent studies, which I cover in the following sections, shows the benefits 
and limitations of this style of management and investing. This information 
can help you clarify what you’re trying to do when you invest socially.
Effects of charitable contributions
Elsewhere in this chapter, I mention the pure capitalist notion that companies 
should be run to maximize profits. If investors want to change the world, the 
thought goes, they should do that on their own with their investment profits, 
rather than expect companies to do it for them.
Liberal bias? Think again!
Some people think of social investing as some 
sort of pinko plot to undermine capitalism. They 
see it as the province of people with more 
money than sense — and not a lot of either.
Like all stereotypes, a few people do fit this 
profile. However, the vast majority of social 
and activist investors come to their practice 
in hopes of making more money. They are the 
owners, so they’re in charge. That means their 
investments work for them. He who has the 
gold should be able to make the rules, as the 
cliché says.
Activist investing is pure capitalism. It uses the 
power of capital ownership to make change.
Social investors look for investments that 
reflect their values, and they use their clout 
to create change. That’s what they have in 
common. Where they differ is on those values. 
Some social investors care about the environ-
ment; others are concerned about social and 
political issues, religious restrictions, or corpo-
rate governance. Many have values that cross 
categories; finding those commonalities allows 
investors to come together to make a difference 
in the world.

12
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
Ah, but charity helps business. In 2006, Baruch Lev and Christine Petrovits of 
New York University and Suresh Radhakrishnan of the University of Texas 
at Dallas found that companies that made charitable donations had larger 
revenue growth than companies that did not (“Is Doing Good Good for You? 
Yes, Charitable Contributions Enhance Revenue Growth,” July 2006). This 
effect was strongest for consumer companies. Most notably, the researchers 
did not find that revenue growth led to greater charitable donations. The 
effect was only one way.
Identifying the 100 most 
sustainable companies
Each year, a group of the world’s movers and shakers meets in Davos, 
Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum. They get together to have cock-
tails and run the world. Well, okay, maybe they don’t quite run the world, but 
the CEOs, politicians, and academics who attend the conference carry a lot of 
influence back home.
Each year at the conference, a new list of the 100 most sustainable corpora-
tions in the world is released (www.global100.org). Each of these com-
panies is listed in the Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) World 
Index, which tracks markets all over the world. These companies are scored 
on their environmental, social, and governance performance, and then 
ranked. The 100 at the top are pulled out and announced with great fanfare. 
Historically, stock in these Global 100 companies has outperformed the MSCI.
It’s not a perfect list for all social investors because it doesn’t take into 
account what a company’s business is. Hence, defense contractors and 
alcoholic beverage manufacturers, which would be loathsome to some 
investors, make the list.
Others have argued that the methodology lets the analysts pick stocks with 
better performance to make the index look good. Still, it’s impressive to see 
so many companies worldwide trying to improve their overall performance in 
order to be one of the rarified 100.
Weighing social performance against 
financial performance
Research by Joshua Margolis of Harvard and Hillary Anger Elfenbein of 
Berkeley (“Doing Well by Doing Good? Don’t Count on It,” Harvard Business 
Review, January 2008) found a very weak relationship between corporate 

13
 Chapter 1: Investing the Socially Responsible Way
social performance and corporate financial performance. Companies that 
behaved slightly better than average performed slightly better than average, 
but not by so much that the researchers could wholeheartedly recommend 
social investing.
On the other hand, they found that social investing doesn’t cost companies 
anything, so as a social investor, you don’t have to give up profits to invest in 
companies whose managers are committed to good behavior.
What’s going on? It could be that companies that have surplus funds can 
engage in good works. It could also be that it simply takes everyone a long 
time to find out just how bad the few bad apples really are.
 
Corporate misdeeds are costly, but only after people find out about them. 
Enron was on several lists of best-run companies until it turned out that 
much of what was going on was fraudulent. (And hence, socially responsible 
investors need corporate transparency, which is covered a little bit later in 
this chapter and a lot in Chapters 4 and 7.)
The Moskowitz Prize for social 
investing research
Each year, the Center for Responsible Business at the University of California 
at Berkeley offers the Moskowitz Prize, a $5,000 award for the best research 
paper on a social investing subject. And each year, the result is at least one 
paper that pushes forward the frontiers of social investing. (You can see 
the complete list at www.haas.berkeley.edu/responsiblebusiness/
MoskowitzResearchProgram.html.) Among the findings of the prize winners:
 
✓ The stocks of companies named to the annual Fortune magazine list of 
the best companies to work for tend to beat the market, indicating that 
treating employees well helps companies perform better.
 
✓ The California Public Employees Retirement System (also known as 
CalPERS) generated $3.1 billion in wealth for its beneficiaries between 
1992 and 2005 from its shareholder activist activities. (You can read 
more about CalPERS’s strategies in Chapter 3.)
 
✓ Using measures of the amounts of corruption tolerated in different 
countries, companies based in places that tolerate more business 
corruption trade at lower stock market multiples than companies based 
in places where corruption is rare.
That’s nice evidence that doing well does right by shareholders!

14
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
Let’s Make a Deal: Exchanging 
Money for Everyone’s Benefit
The financial markets operate with one goal: to bring together buyers and 
sellers. That’s what all the hours of business news on television, the chatter 
on investing radio shows, the commentary on Internet sites, and the pages of 
The Wall Street Journal are covering: Who are the buyers, and what do they 
want right now? Who are the sellers, and what do they want right now? And 
given what both sides want, what should the price be?
It doesn’t matter if it’s real estate, the stock market, oil prices, or new cars. 
The market functions when it brings together the needs of the buyers and the 
sellers at a price that both will accept.
 
Economists like to talk about a market clearing price, which is the price where 
the buyer and the seller are willing to make a deal. The buyer won’t go any 
higher, and the seller won’t go any lower.
From the perspective of social investing, the sellers of stock and bonds — the 
people who need money — may want to make themselves attractive to as 
many prospective investors as possible. Thus, they may clean up their acts! 
The people who have money to buy stocks and bonds may have nonfinancial 
goals; all else being equal, they may prefer to finance companies that match 
their social interests as well as their economic goals. That’s how social 
investing creates change.
Companies and governments 
need financing
Here’s the thing: Organizations need to raise money. Small businesses need 
funds to get started. Big businesses need funds for acquisitions. Governments 
need money to build roads and schools. Hospitals need money for new facilities. 
All of these organizations need to borrow money or find shareowners to join 
with them. The more potential sources of funding they can approach, the easier 
it will be to fund the project and the lower the cost will be.
So businesses and others who need money have an incentive to be the kind 
of borrowers or partners that investors want. If investors want companies 
that have a strong board of directors, then maybe these companies need to 
have one. If investors prefer companies that pay workers in developing 
countries fair wages, then maybe the companies should do just that.
Naturally, investors prefer to deal with companies that make good on their 
financial promises, and social investing may help with that. A company that 

15
 Chapter 1: Investing the Socially Responsible Way
doesn’t pay bribes may not get hit with big tax penalties, for example. A 
company that finds ways to reduce the carbon emitted in shipping goods 
may save a lot of money that goes straight to the bottom line.
Individuals and institutions 
need investments
Who has money to invest? Anyone saving for retirement, to start with, and 
that’s pretty much everyone (or at least it should be!). Many people are also 
saving money for other goals, such as college education for their children or 
grandchildren, or to have money to support a charity after their death. Some 
people are saving for a new car, and others are saving up to take a two-year 
missionary trip with their church.
Bigger investors need to get a return on their money. The Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation and Harvard University have billions to put to work to 
help them meet their goals, whether distributing polio vaccines or expand-
ing undergraduate financial aid programs. The better return those funds can 
earn, the more people they can help. Pension funds may have millions or 
even billions of dollars in benefits obligations to meet, and a good investment 
return will help them pay up at a lower upfront cost. Trust fund managers 
want to make sure they have enough money to meet the growing needs of 
future generations of a rich family.
 
At some nonprofit organizations, the investment manager brings in more 
money a year than the folks in the fundraising office.
Whether large or small, investors set aside money that they don’t need now 
in the hopes of having more money for future needs. Many of those investors 
care about social issues, and it’s not just those with the 10 to 12 percent of 
funds that are invested socially. Many other investors would be willing to 
invest along social criteria if they could find more investment opportunities 
that matched their interests.
Who Invests Responsibly, and Why?
Social investing is big business. Geoffrey Heal, professor of public policy and 
business economics at Columbia University, estimates that 10 to 12 percent 
of all professionally managed investments in the United States come with 
social restrictions of some sort. That’s a lot of money! These restrictions can 
be anything from a refusal to invest in the so-called “sin” industries (alcohol, 
gambling, pornography, and tobacco companies) to a comprehensive style 
looking at the environment, society, and corporate governance.

16
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
Investors who like this style look at how employees are paid and whether 
they can become owners in the company. They look at the company’s 
mission statement, and then evaluate how well it’s put into practice. They 
want to know: Does this company understand its business, and is its business 
making friends rather than enemies?
Who are these investors? Some are religiously observant and want to avoid 
anything that may interfere with their spiritual journey. Some simply think 
it’s about time that company managers listened to the people who own the 
joint. And some would just like a mutual fund option in their 401(k) plan that 
doesn’t make them nervous.
The leaders in social investing are the leading institutional investors (I cover 
these in detail in Chapter 3):
 
✓ Pension funds
 
✓ Charitable foundations
 
✓ Institutional endowments
The role of institutions is important for two reasons:
 
✓ First, these investors care deeply about performance. Most pension 
funds are required by federal law to consider investment performance 
first. They can consider other factors, such as social criteria, only as long 
as the performance is met. Pension funds for religious orders and labor 
unions often want to consider social criteria, so money managers have 
figured out how to accommodate the performance have-to-have and the 
values nice-to-have factors. Foundation and endowment managers have a 
fiduciary responsibility to the philanthropists who donated the money in 
the first place. Because these investors have to worry about performance, 
all investors can benefit from their experience with social investing.
 
 The U.S. law regulating pension management is the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA (rhymes with “Alyssa”). 
Among other things, it affects the choices of funds in your 401(k) plan. 
When the Feds get involved, companies pay attention.
 
✓ In a changing world, investing can be a tool for making a difference. 
The simple reason to invest socially is to maintain a clear conscience, 
but many social investors believe they can also get better performance 
through responsible investments (this is beyond the pension fund 
requirement that performance be as good as it would be without the 
social component):
 
• If investors look for companies that are trying to reduce their 
effect on the environment, they may find companies that are 
saving money and generating more profits.

17
 Chapter 1: Investing the Socially Responsible Way
 
• If they search out businesses that pay workers well, they may find 
some that create more consumers to grow the overall economy.
 
• If they avoid companies with bloated executive pay packages and 
cronies on the board of directors, they may avoid scandals and a 
string of bad financial results.
Contributing to the community
Not all social investors want to change the world. They don’t care about 
sin stocks or business practices in far-off lands. They just want their corner 
of the globe to be in better shape. They’d like to see new employers creat-
ing jobs and paying taxes in their hometown. They’d like to see nicer, safer 
neighborhoods for people to live in. Maybe they just want to keep their 
money with a bank that isn’t likely to be taken over by some major mega-
global financial institution.
If this describes your investing outlook, you can find many different 
opportunities. If you have substantial assets and an appetite for risk, you can 
provide start-up funds to small businesses in the area. If you’re looking for 
a safe, conservative investment, you may want to purchase a certificate of 
deposit with a federally insured Community Development Financial Institution, 
which is a bank that provides services to local residents. I cover this style of 
investing and places to park your money in Chapter 6.
In between those extremes are stock, bond, and real estate investments that 
may make your town a better place to live, work, and play.
Monitoring a company’s managers
Many investors don’t care so much what business a company is in; they’re 
more concerned that the business is truly run for the shareholders (this is 
called corporate governance). That means management has to be paid for 
performance, no more and no less. The members of the board of directors 
should concentrate on providing management oversight and accurate reports 
to shareholders rather than enhancing their social status. Shareholders should 
be able to vote democratically and present proposals for management to 
consider.
Some governance investors look for companies that have great internal 
practices and a demonstrated history of service to shareholders. Others seek 
out companies where the management and board have terrible conflicts of 
interest, performance is lousy, and governance is a mere afterthought. 
They use their power as owners to force the company to change its ways, 
improving investment results.

18
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
And some governance investors combine tactics. They may be interested 
in companies that are located in their own community, but if the company 
doesn’t perform well, the investors are in there with all of their activist tools 
to press the company managers to do better. Someone may have inherited 
shares in a company that can’t be sold under the terms of a trust agreement, 
but that doesn’t mean she has to accept the firm’s environmental practices. 
She can use her power as an owner to push for a board and management that 
are more responsive to her needs. I cover governance issues in more detail in 
Chapter 7.
 
Not all governance activists care about the public good. Some are more 
notorious than noble. However, they’re doing nothing more than exercising 
their rights as owners of the company.
Hugging those trees
Global warming is hot stuff, and it’s not the only issue involving investment 
and the environment. The way that companies make goods, ship them, sell 
them, and then handle the waste has a huge effect on the planet — and on 
the bottom line.
The buzzword is sustainability, which is a company’s ability to maintain its 
profits over the very long haul. If a company relies on petroleum, for example, 
its ability to sustain the business is entirely dependent on the supply and the 
price of oil. If the company figures out ways to reduce total fuel consumption 
and use more alternative fuels, it will have an easier time staying in business 
and generating long-term profits for shareholders. Sustainability is the topic of 
Chapter 8.
Maybe you’re an investor who is excited about environmental investing because 
of the potential for revolutionary new technologies. Maybe alternative fuels 
could be the next television, plastics recycling the next instant photography, or 
greenhouse gas reduction the next Internet. When you’re on the ground floor 
of new technologies, you take a lot of risk, but you have the opportunity for big 
profits. Where there’s a chance of good growth from major change, there will be 
investors ready to support it.
 
Not only do investors want to make money, but so do entrepreneurs. People 
with great ideas are likely to come forward if they see that they can get 
financing for them.

 Chapter 1: Investing the Socially Responsible Way
Investing internationally and socially
The modern corporation operates all over the world. Its managers don’t pay 
too much attention to borders unless there are taxes involved to get across 
them. Investors do pay attention to the countries where companies operate, 
though. Companies that operate in many countries can choose how much 
they pay workers and how they operate their facilities. (Wages too high in 
one country? Move the work somewhere with a lower standard of living.) 
They also have to deal with governments everywhere they operate, and some 
national leaders are downright unsavory people.
An international social investor wants to support businesses that do the 
right thing, even if there aren’t laws forcing proper behavior. This can range 
from paying better-than-market rates to refusing to pay bribes to government 
officials. In many countries, corporations have the money and the power to 
improve conditions, and social investors want to be a part of that. Chapter 9 
shows you how.
Reminders from religion
Some investors have religious practices that set forth rigid restrictions. 
These people must avoid certain investments if they want to live according 
to their faith. Others aren’t necessarily risking their salvation, but they’d 
prefer that their investments line up with their beliefs. If they don’t smoke, 
for example, they may not want to be involved with companies that grow, 
distribute, or sell tobacco. If they’re opposed to war, they may not want to 
invest in defense contractors. If they aren’t allowed to receive interest, they 
won’t be buying bonds. Turn to Chapter 10 for an overview of how religious 
beliefs influence investment choices.
New mutual funds and financial services have been cropping up to meet 
the needs of religious investors. These range from index funds that exclude 
offending companies to new ways to finance home purchases — new ways 
from an American perspective, at least.
Finally, some of the most active investors are affiliated with religious 
schools, charities, and other institutions. They are quick to use the power 
of their material resources to push for positive change. If you’re interested 
in activist investing, you’ll see groups such as the Interfaith Center for 
Corporate Responsibility (www.iccr.org) working to get company 
managers to pay attention to their interests. It’s the owner’s prerogative, 
after all.

20
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
 
If your religion has strict rules about money and finance, you should talk to 
your clergy to make sure your investing program follows them.
Choosing, Monitoring, and Influencing 
Your Investments
After social investors identify their investment criteria, they have to invest 
the same way that any other investor would: by reading financial statements, 
looking up news reports, and maybe even visiting the company.
Easier said than done, right? Not to worry. I give you plenty of help in finding 
the right investment vehicle that also aligns with your criteria.
Ensuring socially responsible choices
Your criteria may exclude certain investments, whether they’re industries, 
such as alcohol, or investment classes, such as bonds. Other social strategies 
may actually expand your investment universe. After you identify the issues 
that are important to you, you may find investments that fit that you may not 
have known about.
Social criteria aren’t enough, though. You have to combine those with 
information about the investment’s financial condition and outlook. No 
investment will do well just because you want it to. Chapter 4 tells you how 
to research investments.
 
Social investors tend to fall in love with a company’s mission, and then 
assume it will be a great investment. It doesn’t work that way.
Keeping abreast of changes
The beauty of social investing is that it forces companies to make changes. 
But the marketplace is so dynamic that companies change all the time 
anyway. To be a successful social investor, you have to stay on top of the 
news (see Chapter 4 for more on this). You want to know if your investment 
is making financial progress and if it still fits your style.
Some companies that fit when you first put money into them won’t always 
stay aligned with your goals: Maybe you don’t invest in companies involved 
in gambling, and the company just acquired a hotel and casino operation. 

21
 Chapter 1: Investing the Socially Responsible Way
Some companies that didn’t fit your criteria may be a good match for you 
now because the management responded to shareholder pressure. The 
positive change may be rewarded with your investment.
 
The specific issues that matter to social investors change all the time. 
International investors have to change their lists of companies and tactics as 
new world hot spots develop. Thirty years ago, many people wouldn’t invest 
in companies that did business in South Africa. Today, the concern for many 
investors is companies that do business in Sudan. What will the concern be in 
30 years? Who knows, but an investor clinging to old notions of good and bad 
will miss opportunities that an up-to-date investor will seize.
Making a careful selection of assets
To be successful as a social investor, you have to do more than just find good 
companies to invest in. You need to find a mixture of investments that reflects 
your risk and return parameters. If you only invest in stocks, you may take too 
much risk and lose too much money in those years when the stock market is 
down. If you put your money in a federally insured bank CD, even if the bank 
specializes in community lending, you’ll have a responsible investment that 
barely beats inflation and probably won’t help you meet your goals.
The good news is that there’s a huge range of investments to help you diversify 
your risk and improve your returns without compromising your investment 
goals. The chapters in Part III have information on everything from life insurance 
to hedge funds. You can invest in real estate, venture capital, and exchange-
traded funds without compromising your social beliefs. And that diversification 
across assets will help you get a better return at the same time.
Using shareholder activism
Shareholders are part owners of a company. Bondholders are lenders, and 
lenders set a lot of terms for behavior. The money gives them power. The CEO 
won’t necessarily take your call if you own 100 shares and the company has 
several million of them outstanding, but you can be an activist nonetheless. 
This book gives you some ideas for how smaller investors can research issues, 
find out who the big investors are, and put the power of their purses to work.
As a stockholder, you have the right to vote on some corporate issues, 
including the members of the board of directors and certain compensation 
packages. Although no one shareholder usually has enough votes to count, 
many shareholders together can combine their votes and put pressure on a 
company’s management to make changes, or else they may have to deal with 
new directors who may not be as accommodating.

22
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
Companies also accept proposals for shareholders to vote on. You can ask for 
a report on environmental policies or for the closing of operations in a world 
trouble spot or for more equitable pay for workers. Even if these resolutions 
don’t pass (and, in truth, they rarely do), the mere fact that they’re proposed 
can sometimes get a management group to think about addressing the issue 
later. Chapter 5 explains how shareholder activism works.
Andrew Carnegie and “The Gospel of Wealth”
Andrew Carnegie was on the scene long before 
Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. Adjusted for 
inflation, Carnegie was worth about $300 bil-
lion, which made him far richer than either of 
his early 21st-century counterparts. He was 
a Scottish immigrant who arrived in Western 
Pennsylvania in 1848 at the age of 13. He went 
to work almost immediately, and at a series of 
successively better jobs, he proved himself to 
be clever and hardworking. He saved as much 
money as he could and invested it in railroad, 
oil, and steel companies, which were the high-
tech industries of their day. Carnegie developed 
a reputation for being tight with money and ruth-
less in business. He didn’t pay his workers well 
because he believed that they’d squander their 
money. His deputy, Henry Clay Frick, hired secu-
rity guards who shot and killed striking workers 
at Carnegie’s Homestead Steel Works.
And yet, although he may not have been a 
model employer, Carnegie believed he had an 
obligation to give his money back to society. 
He became one of the greatest philanthropists 
in history, funding libraries around the United 
States, sponsoring paleontological expedi-
tions, establishing a university in Pittsburgh 
(now Carnegie-Mellon University), and creat-
ing many other institutions all over the world 
that still thrive today, including Carnegie Hall in 
New York City and the Carnegie Corporation, a 
$3 billion charitable foundation.
In 1889, Carnegie wrote an essay about his 
views of philanthropy, entitled “The Gospel of 
Wealth.” In it, he says that capitalism makes 
society better for everyone, but that it also cre-
ates disproportionate wealth for a few. Those 
few have an obligation to spend it on philan-
thropy while they’re alive rather than spend 
it on themselves, give it to their children, or 
leave it to charity only after they die. “Under 
its sway we shall have an ideal state, in which 
the surplus wealth of the few will become, in 
the best sense the property of the many,” he 
wrote. “Thus is the problem of Rich and Poor 
to be solved.”
Carnegie’s practices have influenced those 
who have come after him, even if they choose 
to pay their workers well and negotiate rather 
than open fire. You can read “The Gospel 
of Wealth” online at www.swarthmore.

▶ Getting the principals and agents together
▶ Operating a business the socially responsible way
W
hether it’s a business or a school district, organizations need financing 
to grow, and they often have to rely on outside investors to help them. 
That means they need to operate in ways that make investors comfortable and 
ensure a good return on the investment. A business that plays fair and respects 
all of its stakeholders — employees, customers, vendors, and the community — 
not just its shareholders, is likely to do well in the long run. And that’s the point 
of social investing.
This chapter looks at the research and approaches covering how responsible 
organizations perform. Social responsibility doesn’t seem to cost shareholders 
anything in the way of performance, a concern of some people interested in 
responsible investing. In fact, socially responsible businesses may have an 
edge in attracting low-cost capital, recruiting great talent, satisfying customers, 
and operating with less interference from government regulators.
In this chapter, I also help you understand how responsible organizations 
operate and what information they share with investors. Knowing this 
information helps you justify your social investing activities (like you need 
any help with that, because you’re reading this book). I also introduce and 
give you some insight into the research and analysis steps covered in more 
detail in Chapters 4 and 5.

Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
Looking at How a Company 
Makes Its Money
The hardest thing for any company to do is to come up with a product or 
service that people are willing to pay for. Companies have to do that (and, it 
is hoped, do that responsibly) to stay in business. Because it’s the first step 
for business success, it should also be the first step for an investor who cares 
about social change.
Those goods or services that people are willing to pay for lead to a return for 
shareholders, and that’s a company’s reason for being. Social investors are 
investors first! Many of the things that companies can do that are socially 
responsible are also good for the shareholders, and a lot of other things don’t 
matter one way or the other, so the company can make the right choice and 
keep shareholders happy.
 
In academic theory, a firm has no purpose other than to maximize share-
holder value. In practice, many companies can maximize shareholder value 
while also behaving responsibly.
Businesspeople like to talk about their business models, which are nothing 
more than the explanations of how a company makes its money. It’s the way 
that a company captures the value that it offers to customers. Is its model to 
be the lowest-cost provider? If so, the company will approach business 
differently than one offering luxury goods. For that matter, a company that 
wants to be a low-cost provider through volume discounting will have a 
different business model than one that wants to be a low-cost provider by 
making it easier for customers to do things for themselves.
A company’s business model influences the social choices that a company can 
make because it affects how it can spend money while keeping shareholders 
happy. If customers demand the absolute lowest prices, then management may 
have less leeway to spend money on responsible initiatives and still keep its 
customers — and shareholders — happy.
On the other hand, Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), which uses this low-price business 
model, found that it could keep prices low if it reduced energy costs not only 
in its stores, but also in every step of its supply chain by helping its suppliers 
reduce their costs and by managing its transportation better. Hence, the com-
pany was able to deliver on its business model while improving the environment.
The business model is set out in three parts: the mission, strategy, and tactics. 
A few companies set these out for you in a nice brochure, but most make you 
figure out what’s what. In the following sections, I explain how business models 
work, as well as how a company’s product may influence your decision to 
invest in the company. Then I take a look at how a company gets its products 
and services into customers’ hands.

25
 Chapter 2: The Socially Responsible Enterprise
Mission, strategy, and tactics
Many companies have mission statements to describe what they hope to 
do. The statements are usually just two or three lines long and describe the 
company’s business and operating philosophy at the very highest level: “We 
will be the premier widget company, exceeding customer expectations. We 
recognize that employees are our number-one asset and that everyone in the 
organization is responsible for our sterling reputation.”
But even though many mission statements rely on clichés to telegraph complex 
ideas, they still give an indication of what the company’s priorities are: Is it the 
product or the service? Does the company emphasize low prices or high quality? 
Does it make an explicit statement of responsibility toward customers, the 
community, or employees? Is the mission high-minded, such as creating a 
healthy world, or is it practical, such as to be the market leader? It’s the starting 
point for all decisions down the line.
 
Not all companies have an explicit mission statement, but it’s possible to 
get a sense of a company’s mission from its different shareholder reports and 
marketing materials.
The strategy is the plan for putting the mission statement into action. It looks 
into the future. It isn’t updated frequently, but it does change as needed to 
reflect changes in the company’s operating environment. If the company’s 
mission is to offer low prices to customers, then the strategy may be to buy 
in volume, sell direct rather than through retail stores, or operate with very 
low overhead. A company with a mission of offering cutting-edge technology 
may have a strategy of doing intensive research to develop completely new 
products, or it may choose to find new technologies through acquisitions or 
licensing arrangements.
Tactics are the methods the company uses to meet its strategy. If the strategy is 
to do intensive research, then the tactics may include such matters as recruiting 
scientists, choosing promising areas for further study, and applying for patents 
whenever appropriate. Because the tactics are the specific steps used to run 
the business, managers may change them frequently to meet the needs of the 
ever-changing marketplace.
An organization that really wants to be socially responsible needs to behave 
well in its mission, its strategy, and its tactics. Ultimately, though, the tactics 
are most important because they are responsibility in practice. Tactics are 
where the rubber meets the road.
More than one company has written a highfalutin’ mission strategy and used 
a business model that could be socially responsible. Day to day, though, the 
managers used tactics that generated immediate results with no thought to 
long-term effects or social missions. Why? Because they were paid for those 
immediate results, with no questions asked about how they got them.

26
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
 
Sometimes mission statements are marketing tactics rather than true guidelines 
for corporate behavior. Don’t invest based on a mission statement. Do your 
research to see if the management walks the talk in its strategy and tactics.
Those goods and services 
that make the money
Many social investors look at the revenue line first. Does the company make 
alcohol? Pork sausage? Pornography? Weapons? If so, then the investment 
may not be acceptable under their investment guidelines, and no other factor 
can change that — not the company’s governance, its treatment of employees, 
or its environmental practices.
If the company passes that top-line cut, though, you’ve got some more work 
to do if you care about what a company produces. Are the products good 
ones that add value to society? Does the company management manage the 
product portfolio responsibly? Is the company working on new products that 
could have a profound change on society? Are the fastest growing markets 
ones that you want to support as a shareholder?
Evaluating existing products
Assuming that a particular company passes that first cut for you, you have 
to do a bit more research. Even if the company’s line of business doesn’t rule 
it out, other factors related to the product could, including how the product 
can be used and how it’s disposed of. For example, toymaker Mattel (NYSE: 
MAT) had a serious problem on its hands in 2007, when many of its toys 
tested with higher lead levels than were allowed. Consumers were upset, 
needless to say, and the stock price fell. Investors wanted to be confident 
that the company was going to make good products that didn’t harm the 
children who played with them.
Some companies sell products that are inherently dangerous (such as 
tobacco), while others sell products that may be dangerous if used by the 
wrong person, such as sporting equipment. Likewise, some companies make 
products that may be appropriate for some users but not others, such as 
R-rated movies. Not all of these dangers translate into business risks. As an 
investor, you’re free to invest in anything you want; some decisions may give 
you comfort but not additional profits.
Building the better mousetrap
For some companies, the path to changing the world is through a better 
product. Bill Gates’s vision was to put a computer on every desktop, and his 
company, Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT), changed the way we work, play, and 
communicate. Not everyone loves Microsoft, but its products made the world 

27
 Chapter 2: The Socially Responsible Enterprise
a very different place. Let’s face it, if companies are run for shareholders, 
then a socially responsible corporation is designed to harness shareholder 
greed to make the world different.
 
Greed may not be good, but it’s not always bad, either. You’re investing 
money because you want to have more money in the future. It may be for 
things that are important to you, ranging from college for your children to a 
comfortable retirement or bequests to charities that you care about, but still, 
you want more money. So do businesses.
Many businesses come about because a visionary entrepreneur sees the 
opportunity to make a lot of money by developing a product that changes 
the way the world works. Some are good, some are bad. A bottled water 
company simply takes something that’s more or less free from the tap, puts 
it into plastic packaging, hauls it to stores in trucks that burn fossil fuels, 
and charges more money per gallon for it than gasoline costs. It’s a sweet 
business model — it takes a lot of vision to realize that there’s a way to 
charge people $1.49 for something that used to be free — but it’s not exactly 
socially or environmentally responsible.
 
Companies produce what consumers want to buy. Bottled water may not
be the most responsible product on the market, but if people stopped buying 
it, the companies that package it would find new products to sell. If they 
didn’t, other companies would see the open space in store refrigerators, and 
they’d figure out something new to bring to market.
Some people have the vision to see that there are huge profits to be made from 
a car that runs on something other than fossil fuels. There are profits to be made 
growing food without pesticides, and profits to be made developing low-cost 
computers for people in developing countries. You don’t necessarily have to 
invest in start-up companies to have a stake in innovative new products, because 
successful large companies are often working on the Next Big Thing too.
Getting the products to market
After a company has a product to sell, it has to figure out a way to do just that: 
Sell it. This involves a combination of packaging, advertising, promotion, and 
distribution; like all things socially responsible, getting the product from the 
factory to the shop and into the customers’ hands can be done in responsible, 
neutral, or irresponsible ways.
Packaging and distribution are closely related matters of sustainability and 
cost control. Packaging can be designed with reused and recycled materials 
and then be easy to reuse or recycle, or it can be made from all new materials 
and in as big a quantity as possible. Likewise, the choice of distribution 
method and location also has environmental and cost effects; the more 

28
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
efficiently companies can get goods from place to place, the fewer resources 
will be consumed. You can find out more about packaging and distribution 
issues in Chapter 8.
But then, who buys those packaged goods after they end up on the shelf? 
Some investors don’t care, because it’s not part of their investing style. But 
some do. They may not feel comfortable investing in companies that market 
to teenagers with R-rated catalogs, that sell expensive products to people 
who can’t afford them, or that push goods too aggressively toward children.
 
It’s probably easier to find out about a company’s marketing practices than 
almost any other aspect of its business, because the goal of marketing is to grab 
attention. If you don’t feel comfortable with the product or how a company 
sells it, you don’t have to buy the stock. This is one of those operating areas 
where a change may not add to shareholder value. In fact, changing an effective 
(although tacky) marketing strategy can take value away.
Why Businesses Need Investors
Why even take on investors in the first place? You can probably think of 
companies that are owned by the founder or that have a small number of 
investors and never issued shares of stock or borrowed a dime from anyone.
And all of these companies are small. That’s the sad truth.
At some point, most business owners have to make a choice: stay small and 
make a good living for the owner, or get a lot bigger (and quite possibly make 
an even better living for the owner).
 
Do you want a big piece of a small pie or a small piece of a big pie? That’s the 
nut of the expansion question (and if we’re talking nuts, I suppose we’re talking 
about a pecan pie).
Expansion can be risky, but risk generates the potential for return. The owner 
can give others a share of the business in exchange for the money to help it 
grow larger, or he can take on debt to fund the growth, choosing to deal with 
lenders instead of additional owners.
Think of financing an expansion this way: Suppose you want to buy a house. 
You can save up money for years and then pay cash for it; you can find a 
partner to go into it with you — maybe your parents will give you some of 
the money, or maybe you find a friend and you split the purchase of a two-flat; 
or you can go to the bank and take out a mortgage. If you find a partner or 

29
 Chapter 2: The Socially Responsible Enterprise
take out a loan (or both), you can probably buy a larger place and enjoy it 
for more years than if you save up your money until you have enough to buy 
the place yourself. Of course, if you borrow money or share the purchase 
with someone else, you add some risk. Miss a payment and the bank will 
foreclose. Get into a fight with your partner, and you may both have to sell to 
someone else to get out of the deal.
 
Businesses want to keep investors happy, because they want the funds that 
will help them get larger. A larger business means more opportunities for the 
managers to make money and gain experience, and it means more opportunities 
for the founding owners to make big bucks.
Companies that want to grow need money. Some companies generate enough 
money from their business to finance all the expansion they could possibly 
take on, but most companies reach a point where they need to issue stock or 
borrow money to build a new factory, make an acquisition, or get great new 
products out to market. To get that money, the firm has to persuade someone 
else that it deserves it. Incorporating social principles into the company’s 
culture can help a business attract capital and meet investor expectations for 
return.
Attracting capital
Research shows that about 11 percent of assets under professional 
management follows social criteria. Many social investors are large institutions, 
such as pensions or charitable endowments, which control millions or even 
billions of dollars (you can read more about these investors in Chapter 3). 
With so much money at stake, an organization that wants to expand ignores 
the concerns of social investors at its own peril.
Some social investors look at governance factors, like the makeup of the 
board of directors (you can find out more about that in Chapter 7); others 
may have strict criteria dictated by their religious faith (see Chapter 10 for 
some of those restrictions). The more investors that a company or investment 
project can attract, the easier time it will have raising money — and the 
lower the cost of fundraising will be.
In order to expand, many business managers find that they have to listen to 
investors’ concerns and make changes accordingly. Whether it’s releasing 
more accounting data, adding strict requirements for contractors operating 
in developing nations, or getting out of a product line that generates a great 
deal of pollution, social policies can help businesses expand by attracting 
new sources of funds.

30
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
Meeting investor expectations
At heart, companies are to be run for shareholders. In theory, shareholders 
just want to make as much money as possible. However, some investors will 
take a lower return as long as their goals are being met. They’d rather make a 
little less money in a company that suits their nonfinancial preferences than 
go for the gusto in a business that doesn’t match their personal mores. A 
savvy corporate treasurer may find that following social principles may help 
the company borrow money at a lower rate, pay a lower dividend, or manage 
with less attention to the stock price. That can save the company a lot of 
money, which can go to executive bonuses (ahem) or to fund future growth.
When you do your research, you figure out if the company is responsible for 
the right reasons — or if it’s truly responsible at all.
 
One tool that many companies use for figuring out what projects to take on is 
the net present value rule. A company forecasts the revenue and expenses of 
the proposed project (which could be as big as an acquisition or as small as a 
new marketing campaign), and then it finds the present value of these by using 
the rate of return that shareholders expect to make (which is usually based on 
historic returns or analyst estimates). If the net present value is positive, then 
the project is likely to be a good one.
Following social principles can help generate more positive net present value 
projects in two ways.
 
✓ First, it may attract new revenues or reduce certain operating costs, 
which will increase the forecasted cash generated from the proposed 
project.
 
✓ Second, it may lead to a lower cost of financing for the company because 
investors will have a lower required rate of return, and that leads to a 
higher net present value.
Balancing What’s at Stake: Shareholders 
versus Stakeholders
A business can’t be socially responsible unless it can make the business case 
for being so. That’s not impossible, because many companies have done just 
that over the years. But it’s not always easy.
Legally, corporations are managed for the benefit of their shareholders, who 
own the company. The owners expect the managers to make money for them! 
In the United States, corporate managers have a fiduciary responsibility to 
maximize shareholder value while complying with other laws (Chapter 3 

31
 Chapter 2: The Socially Responsible Enterprise
covers fiduciary responsibility in more detail). Some managers have 
interpreted that to mean that even the teensiest bit of philanthropy is wrong, 
wrong, wrong because it hurts shareholders. But over the long term, making 
money for shareholders involves behaving responsibly to others who have a 
stake in the business.
The following sections cover the differing interests of shareholders and 
others so you can understand the situation that managers are in as they try 
to do the right thing. I also talk about a philosophy that can bridge the gap 
between the shareholders and everyone else, the so-called triple bottom line.
Maximizing shareholder value
The key responsibility of a company is to maximize wealth for its owners, 
the shareholders. That’s a main tenet of financial theory, and it’s held up in 
courts as well. A company’s management has a fiduciary responsibility to 
serve shareholders.
This isn’t as mercenary as it may seem to someone who’s not a shareholder. 
Usually, what makes shareholders happy makes everyone else happy, too: good 
products or services that customers gladly pay for, with good employees who 
are paid well for running the company efficiently. But there are some potential 
pitfalls.
Potential problems
Sometimes management’s desire to get paid well while keeping those pesky 
shareholders off its back leads to cut corners and even outright fraud, 
destroying the business.
There’s another problem with simply maximizing shareholder value. Some 
shareholders care only about the short term. They just want a big profit now, 
and they don’t really care about what happens a month or a year or a decade 
from now.
Most investors are big institutional investors, such as pension plans or 
mutual fund companies, and the managers of those funds have to show high 
performance or the money will go to someone else. They need to beat the 
market right now, this month, this quarter. Sure, the money in the fund may 
not be needed for a long time, but that doesn’t mean the money manager has 
the luxury of thinking long term.
 
In 2002, the last year for which the New York Stock Exchange has data, 21.5 
percent of U.S. stocks were held by pension funds and 49.8 percent by such 
other institutional investors as foundations, endowments, and mutual funds. 
Another way to think about that is that 71.3 percent of stocks are held by 
institutions that live and die by quarterly performance, which forces a lot of 
managers into a short-term perspective. Ouch!

Customer service
Much of what maximizes value over the long term can be costly now, and that 
doesn’t maximize value for the shareholder with the short-term perspective. 
Think about customer service. It’s expensive to keep customers happy. You 
have to take back defective products, answer a lot of questions, and have 
a happy staff that smiles a lot. Keeping those customers happy keeps them 
coming back over the long term.
Customer service is an ongoing expense that creates long-term value. A 
company can boost its profits in the short run by cutting back on customer 
service, which may make the short-term shareholders happy, but all the 
annoyed customers will go elsewhere, harming long-term shareholders.
The key debate about socially responsible behavior by corporations is 
whether it’s good or bad for shareholder wealth. Is it a big expense that 
detracts from the ongoing mission of making money, or is it an investment that 
may take a little from profits now but make the company stronger for years to 
come? Investments in good governance, clean technology, or sustainable 
economic development may take years to pay off, even if the payoff will be 
spectacular. Not all shareholders are patient enough to wait, and some may 
push the company to give up the project.
Remembering stakeholder value
Stakeholders are not shareholders. They’re all the other people that contribute 
to the success or failure of the corporation: employees, vendors, customers, 
members of the community where the company has facilities, and regulators, 
among others. In the short run, corporations can maximize shareholder value 
without even thinking about the other stakeholders, but it can’t do so in the 
long run. A company that wants to maximize shareholder value for years to 
come needs to think about its stakeholders — how it will recruit workers, 
retain employees, and work with the community at large.
Companies are supposed to maximize shareholder value because the 
shareholders are the owners. They put up the money for the company to 
operate, and they expect a return. However, companies use more than just 
shareholder capital to make the business possible. They need other inputs 
for their operations. And some of the key inputs belong to no one but affect 
everyone: air, water, soil.
 
Externality is the term economists use to describe the effects that a business 
has on things that are outside of the price of the goods or services that it sells. 
For example, if a business is polluting the water, there’s a cost to the world, 
but it’s not included in the price of the product. That’s a negative externality. 
Externalities can be positive, too; maybe the company sponsors the local 
symphony as a way of marketing to its target customers, but all music lovers 
benefit from the donation.

33
 Chapter 2: The Socially Responsible Enterprise
Uniting shareholders and stakeholders 
with the triple bottom line
Because a company’s management team has the responsibility to maximize 
shareholder value, it can’t pursue any projects that benefit stakeholders 
unless it can show that these would ultimately pay off for the shareholders. 
A company that plans to stay in business for a long time needs to keep other 
stakeholders happy.
The triple bottom line, popularized by a book of the same name (written by 
Andrew W. Savitz and Karl Weber and published by Jossey-Bass), asks 
companies to account for how their operations and strategies affect people, 
the planet, and — of course — profits. The goal is to get companies thinking 
about how they will generate profits over the long haul by protecting 
important inputs.
 
A key maxim in business is that you get what you measure, because that’s how 
managers set their priorities. That’s why an accounting system that looks at 
externalities as well as plain old profit is more likely to generate good results 
for society as a whole.
A U.K. organization, AccountAbility (www.accountability21.net), has drawn 
up standards similar to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP; the 
rules that govern accounting in the United States) to help companies report their 
social and sustainable activities. About 200 companies use them now, and the 
hope is that more will soon adopt the standards to help investors and others 
understand the effects of business activities.
Remembering the people
Companies involve all sorts of people: employees, customers, contractors, 
and residents in the communities surrounding their facilities. The people 
part of the triple bottom line recognizes that companies are accountable to 
the people they touch. The needs of the people may vary from place to place 
and time to time, but paying attention to how they are treated — and keeping 
track — will lead the company to do the right thing for its stakeholders and 
shareholders alike.
 
One reason to pay attention to people? People talk. And sometimes, they sue, 
which costs the company money. An organization’s reputation is built on how it 
treats the people whom it deals with, no matter who they are or what they do.
Protecting the planet
The planet measure of the triple bottom line looks at how a company’s 
activities affect the environment, from the very moment a product is a gleam 
in an industrial designer’s eye until it’s dead and buried — or not — in a 
landfill somewhere.

34
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
A company’s environmental responsibility derives from how a product is 
sourced, manufactured, and moved to market, but it’s also affected by what 
the company does at headquarters and how it works with its contractors. 
(No fair claiming to be clean while outsourcing your manufacturing to a 
contractor in a country with no environmental laws, and then flying in a big 
old carbon-spewing airplane to check up on things!)
The planetary measures on the triple bottom line can be controversial because 
the science around air, water, soil, and climate evolves as researchers discover 
more about the world around us. No matter how strong the effects of carbon 
on climate change, polluted air isn’t good for anyone. Businesses (and their 
customers and shareholders) need natural resources to survive, so they need 
to use them with care.
Don’t forget profit!
The bottom line is that a business has to make a profit to stay in business, 
and the triple bottom line philosophy recognizes that. Without profits, the 
business will close, and that harms the employees who need jobs, the 
customers who need what the company provides, the government that relies 
on it for taxes, and the shareholders who need a rate of return to meet their 
goals. The company has to show a profit, or the enthusiasm for its social 
activities will die off faster than a polar bear on a melting iceberg.
Ideally, the short-term profits will allow the company to afford its investments 
in people and planet, while those sustainability investments will pay off in 
long-term profits for the smart, socially responsible shareholders.
Heading Off Principal-Agent Problems
Socially responsible investors want to invest in companies that reflect their 
values. As owners, they want the managers who work for them to behave in 
responsible ways.
But managers are human beings, and as human beings, they may want to do 
what’s best for themselves, not necessarily for the people they work for (not 
all are this way). Most corporate managers want to maximize their own 
compensation and career opportunities. Although that’s to be expected, 
raises for employees may well mean reduced profits for the shareholders.
Then throw into the mix that some investors have a short-term perspective 
(a problem outlined earlier in this chapter), while others want the company 
to be around for the ages.
There’s a term for these conflicts of interest between managers and differ-
ent types of investors. It’s the principal-agent problem, with the investors (or 
owners) being the principals and the managers being the agents. It’s hardly 

35
 Chapter 2: The Socially Responsible Enterprise
insurmountable, but it requires that management be transparent about what 
it’s doing so the shareholders have enough information to make decisions. It 
also requires that shareholders pay attention so they can influence what the 
management team is doing before problems develop. The following sections 
provide information on what you, the potential shareholder, can look for in 
terms of what you are and are not likely to find out about a business.
Transparency: How clearly you 
can understand the business
Managers often have very good reasons for not telling everyone everything 
about what they’re doing. Suppose a company that you invest in is about to 
announce an amazing new technology that would reduce energy costs and 
improve water quality in developing nations. Well, gosh, wouldn’t they want 
everyone to know? Wouldn’t you, as a part owner of this company, want 
to know exactly what the technology is, and when it will be rolled out, and 
at what price, and what profit level, and what goals for market share? Sure 
you would.
And so would every one of the company’s competitors. They, too, would 
want to know all about this technology, how profitable it is, and how much it 
will cost so they’ll be ready to strike back!
Hey, it’s tough out there. Businesses all over the world are fighting each 
other every day for customers, for great employees, and for slight advantages 
that add up over time.
As a shareholder, you don’t have the right to information about the tiniest 
details of the business, because the business can’t compete without keeping 
some information confidential. However, you have the absolute right to basic 
information about the company’s finances. More on that in the next section.
Monitoring your holdings
Much of this book is about how to do research on different companies and 
investments to find out how well they match your investment criteria.
Now, all investing requires some work. You have to
 
✓ Figure out your risk parameters and your desired return
 
✓ Set appropriate goals
 
✓ Find suitable investments
 
✓ Track your returns to see if you need to make changes

36
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
 
Social investing adds one more layer: tracking how an investment is meeting 
your personal goals as well as your financial ones. (Many a business has 
announced an exciting new initiative, and then switched course midstream.) 
As an owner, you take on the cost of making sure that the business you invest 
in meets your priorities.
In a perfect world, the managers tell you everything you need to know. But 
where is this perfect world? Most managers report only what they have to, 
usually as mandated by such government regulators as the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission, and not always in a format that’s easy for regular 
folks to read. Because the managers don’t perfectly represent the interests of 
all the shareholders, at least a few of them have to do their own research to 
see how management is doing.
Of course, that’s why you’re reading this book! Much of it is about how to 
determine whether an investment suits you. So keep reading!
Getting owners and managers 
on the same side
Owners and managers don’t have to be locked in bitter combat. Just as the 
business can do well for shareholders while still respecting the interests of 
other stakeholders, so can it make shareholders wealthy while still rewarding 
managers for their hard work. The way to do that is by making owners out of 
the managers. This may call for a little shareholder activism (see Chapter 5 
for more information).
Many companies give employees an ownership stake in the company. That 
way, the employees benefit when the shareholders do. Companies can do 
this several ways:
 
✓ Giving stock as compensation: Some companies give all employees a 
few shares of stock when they join the company or after several years of 
service. The stock may come in the form of a bonus, or it may be part of 
the ordinary compensation package.
 
✓ Retirement plan matching: If the company offers employees a voluntary 
retirement plan, such as a 401(k), it may match some or all of the employee 
contributions with company stock.
 
✓ Stock purchase plan: As an employee benefit, many firms allow workers 
to buy stock without commission, often at a discount to the market price.
 
✓ Employee Stock Ownership Plan: Often called an ESOP (pronounced 
eee-sop), an Employee Stock Ownership Plan allows the employees as a 
group to purchase all or part of the company. This often occurs when a 
division of a larger company is being spun out as a separate company or 
when a business is doing a major restructuring.

37
 Chapter 2: The Socially Responsible Enterprise
 
✓ Granting employee stock options: A stock option gives an employee 
the right, but not the obligation, to buy shares of stock in the future at a 
price agreed to today. For example, a company may give employees the 
right to buy stock three years from now at $5 per share. If the price is 
above $5, then the employee can exercise the option and sell the shares 
on the market for a nice profit. That gives the employees an incentive to 
get the stock price up above the exercise price. Stock options are cheap 
for companies to offer, too.
Check out Chapter 11 for more details on these employee stock plans.
 
Stock options can make managers rich, but they don’t always benefit share-
holders. Companies have been known to give too many options away, to set 
the price so low that holders will always make money, or even to reset the 
price so employees can exercise the option at a profit even if the stock price 
went down on their watch. Although options can ally managers with owners, 
it’s more effective to give employees actual shares if reducing conflicts of 
interest is the goal.
Operating the Organization: Better 
Performance from a Clean Approach
Investors do well when their investments do well. Social investors hope to do 
good, too. But does good behavior help a company to do well? In many cases, 
yes. Following social principles can help a company stand apart in a crowded 
market. It can attract new customers, retain strong employees, and avoid the 
hassles of regulation while also keeping its investors happy.
In this section, I cover just a few of the ways that a clean approach to opera-
tions helps the company perform better (and better operating performance 
should lead to better investment performance).
Courting customers
Think of just about any product you can buy. Do competitors offer alternatives? 
Can you find a suitable substitute? Can you do without it? If the answer to even 
one of those questions is yes, then the company has to fight for your business.
Many companies find that customers want to do business with ethical 
companies that treat their employees well and work to minimize externalities 
(the effects that a business has on things that are outside of the price of the 
goods or services it sells). Customers who are trying to be more conscious 
of the effects of their purchasing decisions appreciate businesses that help 
them out by offering goods and services that are good for society and the 

38
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
environment, or at least not as bad as those offered by other companies. 
Thus, following socially responsible tenets can help a company attract and 
retain customers.
And attracting and retaining customers is key to business success! The 
hardest thing for any company to do is come up with a product or service 
that people want to spend money for. When you think of all the choices you 
have, any company that you deal with should be trying to keep you happy. 
(Not all do, of course. But that’s probably because the management figures 
that you have few other options or that it’s cheaper to get a new customer 
than to satisfy a current one. It happens.)
Because customers, like investors, care about how their money ties to their 
values, they’re more likely to do business with companies that support their 
values. Whether it’s developing environmentally friendly packaging, divesting 
from a war zone, or dropping advertisements from violent television shows, 
many businesses find that a social perspective brings dollars in the door.
 
If customers don’t like how a business operates, they’ll take their money 
elsewhere. At an extreme, they’ll organize a boycott, in which they not only 
avoid a company’s products, but they also encourage everyone they know 
to do so, too. The negative publicity from a well-publicized boycott often 
generates enough pressure to get the company to make changes. And in some 
cases, the bad public relations linger long after the business has improved its 
standards.
Attracting employees
Companies are only as good as the people who work for them. That’s why 
most businesses struggle to attract and retain good employees. While there 
may be ups and downs in employment as the economy zigs and zags, the 
long-run outlook is good for skilled workers: As the U.S. population ages, 
more workers will retire, leaving fewer folks to mind the store.
Many people want to work for an employer with integrity, one that doesn’t 
cut corners on compliance matters, customer service, or care for the envi-
ronment. When the baby busters (the smaller demographic group following 
the baby boom) have their pick of employers, companies will have to com-
pete for their talent, and workplace culture will be one of those measures.
No matter how competitive the job market is, organizations want employees 
whom they can count on. Many a business has been damaged by the actions of 
one or two rogue workers who take money, arrange kickbacks, or selectively 
overlook wrongdoing to get a deal done. A business that has an ethical work-
place culture is likely to avoid such problems, if only because the workers it is 
most likely to attract are least likely to behave badly.

39
 Chapter 2: The Socially Responsible Enterprise
Reducing regulatory hassles
Free markets? Unfettered capitalism? Not hardly. No matter where in the 
world a business operates, it has government overseers. A whole range 
of national, regional, and local agencies keeps an eye on what companies 
operating in their little corner of the world do. The agencies want to make 
sure that the company meets whatever laws apply: employment conditions, 
worker and product safety, environmental regulations, accounting integrity, 
taxation.
Regulators can create hassles for a company. When a regulatory agency 
suspects a problem, it can send investigators and use subpoenas to get 
information about the situation. Even if it finds nothing wrong, complying 
will cost the company money and take time away from the business at hand. 
And if the agency does find a problem, it can slap the company with fines 
and sanctions that don’t exactly enhance shareholder returns. At a minimum, 
mention of the investigation in the media will bring unwanted publicity to the 
company.
 
If a company doesn’t behave well, new regulations can be passed to try to 
get change, creating a new layer of costs and headaches. (At an extreme, the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which overhauled the U.S. financial reporting 
system and cost companies millions of dollars to meet its requirements, was 
passed in response to the behavior of just a handful of people at a handful of 
companies, like Enron and WorldCom. Ouch!)
Regulation isn’t going away, because there are always going to be a few 
companies that don’t play nice with everyone else. Given that it’s a reality, 
the best way for a company to avoid the pain of regulation is to do right in 
the first place. Sure, there will still be pages of forms to wade through and 
lists of requirements to check off, but there will be less interference from the 
agencies for those businesses that get it right the first time. Companies that 
meet many social investing criteria are more likely to follow the rules and 
less likely to run into trouble with the Feds.
Opening international markets
It’s a big global world out there, and businesses that have a reputation for 
good behavior have an easier time with global expansion. Sure, a corrupt 
company has a big advantage in a few locations, but those aren’t exactly the 
most desirable markets to be in. Instead, a company that’s looking for joint 
venture partners, overseas distributors, or plain old customers is better off 
if it has a good reputation back home and a culture that supports such 
transparent business practices as cooperation with regulators and disclosure 
of payments in order to head off bribery.

40
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
A global brand is an enormous asset, one that forms the competitive 
advantage that investors and managers alike crave. One way to build that 
brand is to adhere to high standards, no matter where the business operates. 
That prevents problems at home and abroad.
 
Investors at home care about a company’s actions overseas. Many a 
corporation with a household-name product has found itself in hot water 
with customers when investigators discover that it operates sweatshops, 
pollutes the environment, or does business with countries with human rights 
violations on the other side of the globe.
Accounting for tax advantages
Taxes pay for schools and roads, but no one really enjoys paying their share. 
Many businesses can reduce their pain come April 15 through clean, socially 
responsible operations. How? Well, national, regional, and local governments 
offer tax breaks that savvy social businesses can claim.
For example, many economically disadvantaged regions want to attract 
employers. One way they can do this is by offering tax breaks to companies 
that agree to add a certain amount of business or hire a set number of 
workers in the local economy. Many investors seek out companies that are 
committed to economic development, which you can read about in Chapter 
6; social investors who prefer investments in real estate, which is covered in 
Chapter 15, will almost always look at the tax benefits related to economic 
development projects.
Charitable donations are deductible from income taxes, and one way that 
many companies give back to their local communities and build their brands is 
by supporting philanthropic activities. It’s another twofer: a benefit to society 
and a benefit to the business, and what social investor doesn’t like that?
Finally, spending to support the workforce is almost always deductible, and 
it’s almost always associated with the kind of company that a social investor 
likes. Healthcare, retirement benefits, and safe workplaces all cost money, 
but those expenses lead to tax savings (not to mention lower workforce 
turnover and higher productivity). You can read more about how companies 
support their employees in Chapter 11.

I
f you’re simply trying to do better with your life and your investments, 
you may be tempted to skip this chapter. Do you care about what big, 
rich, professional investors are involved with? Probably not. But if you’re 
interested in social and activist investing, then you may want to pay attention 
to what the people with the mega millions are doing.
For example, if you would like your employer to offer a socially responsible 
mutual fund as one of the choices in its 401(k) plan, or you want your college 
to consider greenhouse gas emissions when choosing investments, you need 
to know how to make your case! This chapter covers the constraints that 
pensions, foundations, and endowments have so you can better understand 
how to influence their choices.
And if you’re not interested in this chapter, that’s okay. It won’t be on the 
final exam.
 
Pensions, foundations, and endowments dominate most stock market trading, 
and they lead many of the big shareholder activism projects. But they aren’t 
faceless institutions. The folks who manage these funds are accountable to 
many others, including average people (who may be beneficiaries, donors, or 
employee representatives) simply trying to live better lives and make better 
investments. They may be managing your retirement, supporting charities 
that you care about, and financing your education.

42
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
Getting Familiar with the Rules
It may seem that Wall Street is populated with gun-slinging capitalists who 
do whatever they want, but it’s not. Many corners of the investment business 
are highly regulated, and that can affect if and how investors choose to be 
responsible.
Because pensions are required by law to maximize investment performance, 
much of the research on how to make social investing profitable has come 
from these rich and rarified corridors. Money managers who want to collect 
fees for managing these large pots of money work to find ways to help these 
institutions meet their social and financial obligations. Their efforts, in turn, 
have helped improve the performance of other social investments, such as 
mutual funds. However, there are rules that must be followed.
The U.S. government guarantees employee pensions in the event that the 
sponsoring employer goes bankrupt. In exchange, the government places 
strict rules on how pension plans are invested to ensure that those plans 
remain solvent. That’s why pension plans have to put social responsibility 
behind performance. Still, many manage to invest responsibly, and their 
experiences have influenced the entire field.
These rules can affect how your retirement money is invested. But you may find 
yourself in a position where you have to follow them. Maybe your union elects 
you to the board of the pension trust. Maybe you join a nonprofit organization’s 
board of directors and have to make decisions about what to do with the 
endowment. Or maybe you take a job with a not-for-profit hospital or university 
and find that your budget is constrained because of endowment restrictions. If 
you know a bit about the rules and why they exist, you can ask better questions 
and make better decisions.
The fiduciary fix
A fiduciary has legal responsibility for investing for the beneficiary’s benefit 
and no one else’s. Someone acting as a fiduciary can’t invest for his personal 
gain, nor can he make decisions that may benefit anyone other than the 
beneficiaries.
 
Fiduciary decisions are different from business decisions. A fiduciary decision 
involves how to invest in the plan, but a business decision is whether to offer 
the pension plan in the first place. After the plan is in place, all fiduciary 
requirements have to be met.

43
 Chapter 3: Understanding Why Institutions Invest the Way They Do
In general, fiduciaries must
 
✓ Act solely in the interests of the investment program’s beneficiaries for 
the purpose of providing benefits to them
 
✓ Carry out their duties prudently
 
✓ Follow the investment documents
 
✓ Diversify investments
 
✓ Pay only reasonable expenses
Covering corporate pensions
A pension is a retirement plan offered by an employer. In the United States, 
pensions fall into two main categories:
 
✓ Defined benefit: In a defined benefit plan, the employer agrees to 
pay retirees a set percentage of their salaries when they retire. The 
employer is responsible for investing the money appropriately.
 
✓ Defined contribution: In a defined contribution plan, the employer 
agrees to set aside some amount of the worker’s pay (often as a match 
for whatever money the worker agrees to contribute); usually, the 
worker can choose to invest the money in a variety of mutual funds or 
other investments. (A 401(k) plan is one of the most common defined 
contribution plans.) The return isn’t guaranteed.
The organization setting up and managing the pension has plenty of rules 
to follow to ensure that workers receive the money they’ve been promised. 
Those rules affect social investing practices. It’s not easy for a pension to be 
socially responsible, but it’s not impossible as long as the legal requirements 
are met first (which I explain in the following sections).
The following sections help you understand why your pension is invested 
as it is and why your 401(k) includes the choices that it does. Knowing this 
information can also help you make your case for change, because change 
has to be within these constraints.
 
Participation in many retirement plans is optional, but you shouldn’t opt out 
if the fund doesn’t offer an investment choice that matches your mores. You 
can often save far more money within a retirement plan than outside of it 
because of the tax advantages and employer matching funds. That employer 
contribution is free money! All you have to do to get it is join the plan. In most 
cases, you can do more good by investing in the retirement plan. For example, 
you can donate some of the money that you otherwise would pay in taxes to 
organizations that you care about, instead of opting out of the retirement plan 
in favor of a social investment that doesn’t have tax benefits or an employer 
contribution.

Introducing ERISA
ERISA is a pretty word, isn’t it? Doesn’t it seem like it would be a unique name 
for a baby girl? It stands for the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 
and it’s a powerful law. It explains what a private company offering a pension 
plan must do to keep the plan legal; in exchange, the IRS gives employers a tax 
deduction for contributions to many types of plans, and the U.S. government will 
insure pension benefits in the event of a corporate bankruptcy.
Under ERISA, a company offering a pension plan must
 
✓ Have a written plan explaining how the pension is set up and operated
 
✓ Create a separate trust fund to hold plan assets outside of the 
corporation
 
✓ Develop a record-keeping system to track funds
 
✓ Prepare documents giving information to employees and to the 
government
Employees, who are the pension’s beneficiaries (people who receive the 
investment’s income), often have their own ideas about how the money 
should be invested. Some of these ideas would seem to benefit them, too, 
but that doesn’t mean the ideas can be included in the pension’s investment 
policy.
“Wouldn’t it be great if our pension were only invested in unionized 
companies?” the employees might say. And yes, it would be great, if (and 
only if) stock in those companies offered comparable investment returns to 
nonunionized companies. However, the risk-and-return decision has to come 
first. The pension has to be invested in order to generate the return required 
to meet the payment obligations to the plan beneficiaries (for defined benefit 
plans).
Now, that doesn’t mean that the pension has to invest in any old company 
that meets the risk-return criteria. It simply means that the fund managers 
have to look at return first. If they come up with a list of five companies that 
meet their financial criteria, they can choose to invest in only the three that 
also meet social criteria. But if no socially suitable investments are available, 
the money must be put into the most financially appropriate investments.
 
If you want your employer to add a socially responsible mutual fund to its 
401(k) plan, you’ll have a better case if you offer the names of funds that have 
competitive performance. A great place to research mutual funds is 
Morningstar, www.morningstar.com. There’s also a company called SocialK 
(www.socialk.com) that offers a socially responsible 401(k) program that 
companies can adopt.

45
 Chapter 3: Understanding Why Institutions Invest the Way They Do
Some social screens may not increase investment return but can reduce the 
costs of investing, and holding down costs is a major concern for fiduciaries 
under ERISA. For example, companies with good governance may not always 
have a better return, but it’s easier for investors to analyze and monitor them. 
That’s one way a fiduciary can justify a socially responsible investment.
Fiduciaries: Looking out for the pension’s best interests
Remember when you were a kid and your parents wouldn’t let you do some-
thing that you really wanted to do? They’d say, “I’m only doing this for your 
own good, and someday you’ll thank me.” Your mom or dad was doing 
exactly what fiduciaries have to do sometimes.
A fiduciary’s loyalty to the beneficiaries is based on providing plan benefits, 
not other matters that may be of interest to the beneficiaries. (Check out the 
earlier section, “The fiduciary fix,” for more details on fiduciaries.) It’s not 
always clear how a fiduciary’s decisions today best benefit the plan partici-
pants in the long run. The fiduciaries act for the beneficiaries’ own good, and 
someday, during retirement, those beneficiaries will thank them. (Just like 
you may now be grateful to your parents, or you may be in therapy to heal 
the damage they did.)
For example, suppose the employer’s biggest customer is about to be taken 
over by a competitor, and the plan owns shares in that company. Employees 
may want the plan’s fiduciaries to vote against the takeover. After all, if it 
goes through, it may hurt their business and cost them their jobs. That would 
be bad for the beneficiaries! But if the acquisition increases the share price, 
then the plan should vote for it because it would be good for the beneficia-
ries from the perspective of their pension benefits, which the fiduciaries 
must put first.
As for how the business will compete after the acquisition? That’s an issue 
for the company’s managers, not for its pension fund officers.
Quashing an ERISA myth
There’s a common myth that pensions aren’t 
allowed to pursue socially responsible invest-
ments under ERISA, but that’s not true. In 
1998, the U.S. Department of Labor, which 
enforces ERISA and other pension regulations, 
issued an advisory opinion to Calvert Group, a 
money management firm following a socially 
responsible style, about whether such a fund 
is appropriate under the law. The department 
ruled that it is, as long as the risk-and-return 
profile is better than or equal to that of a simi-
lar investment with no social criteria. You can 
see the opinion, in all its glorious legalese, at 
www.dol.gov/ebsa/programs/ori/
advisory98/98-04a.htm.

Fiduciaries aren’t just for ERISA plans. Anyone you hire to help you with your 
investment planning may be a fiduciary. What you need to know is, are their 
fiduciary responsibilities to you or to the firm that employs them? That’s a key 
question to ask!
Being prudent about managing money
ERISA creates another standard, that of a prudent expert. It’s an extension 
of state laws that require people managing money for others to be prudent 
persons. And just who is a prudent person? It’s a person who acts with 
discretion and intelligence to seek a reasonable investment return. It’s an 
unfortunate “you’ll know it when you see it” standard.
Under the prudent person rule, fiduciaries are expected to avoid speculative 
investments. The prudent expert standard is higher; it assumes that this 
person of discretion and intelligence has been trained in investing and stays 
up-to-date on the state of the financial markets. So a prudent expert can invest 
in speculative investments if they make sense relative to the entire pension 
portfolio.
 
If you’re invited to serve on an employee pension committee at your 
workplace, or if you’re elected to serve on your labor union’s pension board 
of trustees, you’ll be held to a prudent person standard (unless, of course, 
you have a degree in finance and work in the financial markets). But you’ll be 
expected to use that status to hire prudent experts to help manage the fund’s 
investments.
Managing state and local pensions
A state or municipal employee pension doesn’t have to meet ERISA standards. 
Why? Because the federal government can’t interfere with the business of 
running a state as long as the state laws are in accordance with the U.S. 
Constitution. But this doesn’t mean that these pensions can do whatever they 
want to, even if it looks like they can under the law.
ERISA was passed so that if a corporation goes bankrupt, the U.S. government 
will take over the pension liabilities. However, if a state or local pension goes 
bankrupt, who takes over the liabilities? You, the taxpayer, do. So if you’re 
a taxpayer with an interest in social investing, it’s good to understand the 
financial issues and vote accordingly. But vote with your head before your 
heart.
Here’s the thing: The good citizens of a state may want the pension money 
invested in ways that suit their political and economic goals. “Wouldn’t it be 
great if our state employee pension invested in companies that were based 
right here? Think what that would do for our economy!” they say.

47
 Chapter 3: Understanding Why Institutions Invest the Way They Do
But not every state is a booming economic machine, and not every company 
is a worthwhile investment. In some places, billions of dollars invested in 
local businesses would quickly lead to poor investment performance, and 
then the taxpayers would be on the hook for making up the shortfall.
 
Some social investment styles can add value to the pension fund. For example, 
maybe a company has a history of lax environmental standards that have 
created huge liabilities. Avoiding that stock may help increase investment 
returns.
The citizens aren’t the only ones with an agenda. Sometimes politicians want the 
state and local pension funds to be invested in ways that suit their pet projects. 
Maybe they want big investments in agriculture or in residential real estate in 
their district or in alternative energy. They may make announcements in hopes 
of garnering votes without considering the long-term tax consequences of sloppy 
social investment policies. If these ideas don’t make financial sense, then the 
pension beneficiaries will suffer and so, ultimately, will the taxpayers.
 
When it comes to pension investing, the rule should always be beneficiaries 
first, social criteria next.
Checking out charitable foundations
A charitable foundation is a pool of money that’s invested for philanthropic 
purposes. Some foundations support a specific organization, while others 
give away grants to a range of worthy causes. You can usually deduct contri-
butions to charitable foundations from your income tax, and the foundation 
doesn’t pay any tax on its investment performance.
Under U.S. tax law, a foundation has to give away at least 5 percent of its net 
assets for appropriate charitable purposes each year. Some foundations are 
tiny, and others are huge. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the largest 
in the United States, has $37.3 billion in assets as of March 31, 2008, and pays 
out about $2 billion each year.
Charitable foundations have a lot of freedom in their investment strategy 
because they don’t have the same amount of oversight as that of an ERISA 
fund. Some foundations view responsible investing as part of their mission. 
Others prefer to invest for higher returns, with or without concern for the 
responsibility of the investments, to maximize the amount of money they 
can spend on their missions. A foundation’s trustees have a fiduciary 
responsibility to the foundation’s beneficiaries, which means that they have 
to consider investment performance.

48
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
The Internal Revenue Service expects foundations to spend their money on 
bona fide charitable purposes. The operation of a foundation is covered by 
state laws governing trusts, which require boards of trustees made up of 
prudent persons (those people who use diligence and care; see the “Being 
prudent about managing money” section earlier in this chapter). Any charges 
against a foundation for a breach of fiduciary responsibility are brought 
under the law of the state where it’s based, not under federal law.
 
Most states have adopted the Uniform Trust Code, which standardizes 
the management of trusts and foundations and the requirements of their 
trustees — namely, that they be loyal to the trust’s beneficiaries. You 
can see the model law at www.law.upenn.edu/bll/archives/ulc/
uta/2005final.htm.
The foundation investment trustees are not only legally accountable to the 
fund’s beneficiaries, but they’re also morally accountable to those who 
donate money. If the board isn’t making smart investment decisions, the 
foundation may find that its ability to raise funds is limited. Donors want 
their money to be put to good use, after all, and that means generating 
enough investment return to serve the foundation’s beneficiaries for years to 
come. Often, major donors are invited to serve on the board of trustees as a 
way of creating accountability. And often, when a board is suspected of 
violating its fiduciary responsibilities, it’s the donors who cause the fuss.
Appreciating endowments
Endowments are like foundations in that they’re designed to support a 
philanthropic institution; donations to them are deductible from income 
taxes; and the income they earn isn’t taxed. But they have one key difference: 
An endowment is designed to support the institution in perpetuity (that is, to 
go on forever). Whether the beneficiary is a university, a museum, or a 
synagogue, and whether the endowment is in the thousands or billions, not 
one penny of it has to be spent in any given year.
The biggest American endowments support universities. Harvard, for example, 
has $34 billion and is the second-largest charitable fund in the United States, 
behind the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (Mr. Gates, of course, isn’t 
a Harvard alumnus because he dropped out after starting Microsoft in his 
dorm room. He’s a contributor to his not-quite alma mater, though.)
Setting endowment spending rules
Universities tend to spend 3 to 5 percent of their endowments each year, 
even though they don’t have to. Still, a lot of graduates leave with big student 
loan burdens. That’s because many endowment funds are earmarked for 
specific purposes, ranging from research in ancient Chinese literature and 

49
 Chapter 3: Understanding Why Institutions Invest the Way They Do
medieval music concert series to scholarships for students from particular 
congressional districts. The endowment trustees have to honor the donors’ 
wishes when they determine how much money to spend each year.
By law, endowments don’t need to spend any of their money; the funds are 
there for the perpetual support of the institution. If it doesn’t need the money 
this year, then it doesn’t have to spend anything. Nevertheless, some people 
believe that an endowment has a responsibility to spend its money.
However, many endowments do spend large amounts of their capital every 
year on the institutions that they support. Therefore, they have to consider 
their spending in their investment policy; it’s more important than any social 
criteria in place.
Although foundations and endowments don’t have the same spending 
requirements, endowments, like foundations, are accountable to people who 
give money to the fund and to those who receive it. Some donors may not like 
their money going to stocks in countries with repressive political regimes, but 
others would be really unhappy to find out that fewer scholarships could be 
given or less cancer research could be performed because the trustees made the 
nature of the investments more important than the financial considerations.
Protesting for change on campus
Unlike endowments at other institutions, colleges and universities have 
faculty and students who follow the news, study issues carefully, and are 
happy to protest when they don’t like what they see. In fact, many faculty 
members view endowment issues as an opportunity to help students learn 
more about current events, ethics, and finance at the same time.
Protesting endowment investments is a time-honored tradition on many 
campuses, whether or not the trustees like it. Because the world changes so 
quickly, a social investing policy that made sense a few years before may not 
fit anymore. As the issues change from sweatshops to the Sudan and a new 
crop of students arrives on campus, there’s new pressure.
There’s even an organization to help students stay focused and run effective 
campaigns. The Responsible Endowments Coalition, www.endowmentethics.
org, is a clearinghouse for student and faculty activities promoting social 
investing on their campuses. The site includes information on key issues, advice 
on how to work with administration and trustees, and sample proposals for new 
investing policies.
On some campuses, students have worked with alumni to start alternative 
foundations that invest according to socially responsible guidelines. Donors 
can give money to the fund rather than to the endowment. Each year, the 
alternative fund sends money to campus for current operating needs.

Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
Tools for Institutions with 
a Social Mission
An individual who wants to follow a social investment strategy is responsible 
only for herself, but an institution has to be careful that it doesn’t short-
change stakeholders. This means an institution’s fiduciaries need to be more 
diligent about researching and selecting the right investments.
It’s not enough for the trustees of a pension to do a Web search on Islamic 
mutual funds, for example; it requires some study to show that the fund has 
a plan for generating income to meet agreed-to spending requirements while 
avoiding fixed-income securities.
But social investors have more tools than just investment selection. Institutional 
investors who had to balance performance with their missions pioneered 
techniques for improving their social position without compromising other 
aspects of their business. These techniques can help you, whether you care 
about a pension or an endowment or if you’re trying to do better on your own.
 
There’s no reason that a social investing program should shortchange anyone, 
but it has to be carefully thought out first.
Using consultants
Because the trustees of pensions, foundations, and endowments need to show 
that they’re meeting all of their fiduciary responsibilities, they usually hire 
consultants to audit financial results, analyze investment performance, and 
recommend changes based on performance, contributions, and expected 
spending needs. Some consultants specialize in social investing and can work 
with the trustees to design an investment policy and find suitable investments 
while still meeting all financial objectives.
 
Consulting fees are paid by the plan beneficiaries, because the money comes 
out of their return. Fiduciaries must ensure that the beneficiaries’ money is 
spent properly — that the fees go to the consultant offering the best services, 
rather than to the one who has the best baseball tickets or other client perks.

51
 Chapter 3: Understanding Why Institutions Invest the Way They Do
Maintaining transparency
Investors tend to prefer companies that are transparent, which means 
that they
 
✓ Publish financial reports in more detail than is required by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission
 
✓ Give regular updates on the progress of the business
 
✓ Have managers who are willing to answer investors’ questions
However, the same pension, foundation, and endowment investors who want 
transparency from the companies that they invest in aren’t always willing to 
give it to their own stakeholders. The double standard is alive and well. 
I’d argue that maintaining transparency is an important first step in social 
investing, one that costs nothing. True, some investing strategies are 
proprietary, but beneficiaries deserve information about the asset classes 
used and the general investing principles followed.
Joining coalitions
In addition to choosing investments that fit the social mission, a pension, 
foundation, or endowment can generate change by finding other like-minded 
institutions to join it in pressuring companies to improve their performance.
CalPERS is an example of how creating a coalition works (see the nearby 
sidebar for more details). CalPERS, the pension system for employees of 
the state of California, identifies troubled companies, and then it finds other 
investors and asks them to join its campaign. Those investors meet as a 
group with the company’s management to explain their case, and they agree 
that they’ll vote for board members who support them. CalPERS is able to 
force laggard companies to make changes because they can get other 
investors to go along with their ideas. (It doesn’t hurt that CalPERS has 
shown great performance from this technique.)

52
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
Voting proxies
A proxy is the form that investors use to vote for members of the board of 
directors, executive compensation packages, and other proposals that a com-
pany presents. Under ERISA, a proxy belongs to the fund’s beneficiaries and 
must be voted in their best interests. That’s a good policy for fiduciaries who 
aren’t beholden to ERISA, too. It’s a way of showing a company’s manage-
ment that the investors are paying attention and either support what they’re 
doing or want change. (Chapters 4 and 5 have more information on proxies.)
The CalPERS Story
The largest state pension in the United States 
is the California Public Employees Retirement 
System, also known as CalPERS. It has $242.2 
billion to invest on behalf of 1.5 million benefi-
ciaries, and much of that money is invested with 
clear social goals in mind. The fund has a long 
track record of success, so it’s often viewed 
as a model for what a public pension should 
be. Much (but not all) of CalPERS’s money is 
invested along social lines, making its success 
even more notable.
Under its current investment strategy, CalPERS 
allocates some of its portfolio to investments 
in the state of California and some to emerging 
environmental technologies. It invests much of 
its money internationally, but only in countries 
with political stability, basic democratic insti-
tutions, and enforced labor laws, among other 
standards.
Where CalPERS has earned the most renown 
in the activist investment world is with its cor-
porate governance investment strategy. Each 
year, the fund identifies several companies 
in its portfolio that are underperforming their 
industry groups and that have terrible corporate 
governance practices. For example, one of the 
companies on the 2008 list is The Cheesecake 
Factory, a restaurant chain based in California. 
For the five years ending February 2008, the 
stock underperformed the average restaurant 
company by 140.5 percent. That’s real money 
that could go to real California pensioners!
Being in CalPERS’s home state doesn’t give a 
company a pass on performance. When a com-
pany makes the target list, CalPERS staffers 
get together with their peers at other pension 
funds, charitable foundations, and mutual fund 
companies, and then press the company for 
major changes in management compensation, 
the board of directors, and disclosure prac-
tices. Companies that make the list are often 
forced to change, and on average, they end up 
outperforming the S&P 500 index the year after 
they make the list.

S
ocial investing means different things to different people. A Muslim 
has a different investment universe than a tree hugger. Furthermore, 
companies change over time, so a definitive list of acceptable investments 
would be out of date in a matter of months.
This is why a socially responsible investor has to be a fundamental analyst, 
too. What’s that? A person who does careful research into the financials and 
the business to figure out how a company makes its money, whether that 
source of profits will continue, and how the company fits into an investment 
portfolio. Social investors need to figure out what to look for, and then find it, 
before making an investment. And that’s what this chapter is all about.
Most of the information here is most useful for analyzing public stocks, 
but it can be applied to other investments, too. Accounting terms, board of 
director responsibilities, and monitoring ongoing events come into play for 
almost any investment you come across.

Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing
Reading and Understanding 
an Annual Report (10K)
The annual report is the key to understanding what a public company does to 
earn money. In most cases, it’s the first place to look for information to help 
you determine whether to make an investment.
Every year, publicly traded corporations have to file an annual report with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The required form is called 10K, 
and it is a veritable treasure trove of information about a company. The 
problem? It’s not very pretty. It’s usually printed in plain type on plain paper, 
with nary a chart, graph, or photo to break up the text and numbers.
But that’s the annual report you should be reading. Many companies also 
publish a glossy, four-color annual report that contains some, but by no 
means all, of the information in the 10K. Some annual reports are gorgeous; 
there are even competitions for annual reports that judge their photography 
and design. The 10K is beautiful only to those who take the time to read it 
and find the rich information within.
Every quarter, the SEC requires companies to file an update on their progress 
on form 10Q. These reports are similar to the annual report, although without 
as much detail; they’re important for tracking changes in the business over the 
year. I cover these in more detail later in the chapter.
The 10K report starts out with an overview of what the company does to make 
money. The company’s management describes the business, its history, and its 
strategy. The report gives a lot of data about products, business locations, and 
employees. The key business risks are described, as well as any outstanding 
legal issues and related matters that employees need to know about.
Next, you get to the meat: management’s discussion and analysis of financial 
conditions and operating results; signatures and certifications; the financial 
statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and statement 
of cash flows; and the footnotes to the financial statements. I describe all of 
these in the following sections.
 
Want to find a 10K report to help you follow along as you read the next sections? 
Go to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s EDGAR database (www.
sec.gov/edgar.shtml), which includes all filings of all public companies in 
the United States. You can search for a company that interests you and find its 
10K report. Any company will work because the basic format is standard.

55
 Chapter 4: How to Research Responsible Investments
Management’s discussion and analysis
The management’s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of 
operations, usually shortened to the much more concise abbreviation MD&A, is 
the executive spin on what happened. It’s not a marketing document, though, so 
you can expect to see bad news. What it tells you is where the company made its 
money and what the outlook is for its different business lines.
The MD&A starts with a repeat of some of the business description listed 
earlier in the 10K. Then it describes how the company’s profitability changed 
line by line from one year to the next — maybe not in as much detail as you’d 
like, but it’s better than you trying to guess! It may break revenues down into 
different business lines and geographic areas, describe such extraordinary 
circumstances as natural disasters or lawsuits that affected operations, and 
discuss areas where the management plans to invest and expand.
After reading the MD&A, you may be finished with your analysis — the company 
may not be what you had hoped it would be when you started your analysis. Or 
maybe you’re intrigued. If you are, then it’s time to look at the certifications.
Signatures and certifications
Financial reports are prepared by company management, but publicly traded 
companies have to have their financial reports audited by an outside firm. 
The audit firm issues two statements that are included in the 10K report. The 
first is the certification of the accounting results, and the second is the report 
on internal controls.
How many days are in a year?
“Thirty days hath September, April, June, and 
November; of 28 hath but one; and all the rest 
have 31.” Unless you happen to be an accoun-
tant. Accountants would prefer that a year be 
composed of 12 months that have 30 days each, 
for a total of 360 days. Of course, the world isn’t 
run by accountants.
Companies have different practices for set-
ting the ending dates of months, quarters, and 
years. Some go by the calendar, some by the 
last business day of the month, and some by the 
last Friday of the month. After a few reporting 
periods, the company may be off by a week, and 
that has to be tacked on somewhere. Companies 
disclose their calendar practices in the manage-
ment’s discussion and analysis and in the foot-
notes to the financial statements. Sometimes 
the difference in performance between two 
companies in the same industry may be that 
one company had 51 weeks in its accounting 
year, while another had 53. Also watch out for 
sudden changes in calendar practices, which 
may indicate that the company is stretching to 
make its estimates.

56

Certification of financial results
The first certificate is a letter from the accounting firm describing what it did 
in the audit and what it found. A typical letter is printed below in italics; my 
explanation of what the different sections mean follows each paragraph in 
plain old regular text.
SocialCo
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors
SocialCo, Inc.
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of 
SocialCo, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2006, and December 30, 
2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ 
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years 
in the period ended December 31, 2007. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
Here, the auditors are making clear that management is responsible for the 
numbers presented. If it turns out that a handful of executives made up the 
results, well then, don’t blame the auditors.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. 
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made 
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement 
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our 
opinion.
The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, often referred to by the 
acronym PCAOB (some people pronounce it peek-a-boo, but most simply say 
each letter), is an organization created by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to 
create standards for audits. Here, the accounting firm is explaining that it 
followed the guidance of the PCAOB. You’ll never see an audit firm say that it 
didn’t!
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of SocialCo, Inc. at 
December 31, 2006, and December 31, 2007, and the consolidated results 
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles.

57
 Chapter 4: How to Research Responsible Investments
At last, the key paragraph! The audit firm is willing to say that the financial 
statements are a fair representation of the firm’s financial position. That 
means it’s an unqualified opinion — there are no exceptions or catches to 
the statement. Most companies will have a similar statement in their annual 
reports, but every now and again, an audit firm will issue a qualified opinion. 
It will say that the financial results are fair representations except for what-
ever issues the auditors uncovered. Investing in a company with a qualified 
auditor opinion is riskier than investing in one without, but an unqualified 
opinion like this one doesn’t signify a safe investment.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board, the effectiveness of SocialCo, Inc.’s 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based 
on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
and our report dated February 29, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion 
thereon.
Giant Accounting Firm LLP
February 29, 2008
Here, the audit firm discusses the financial controls of the company, which it 
must test to ensure that the company is able to create accurate financial 
statements. Financial controls cover such things as whether people lose access 
to the computer system when they quit or who approves any adjustments to 
sales figures, and they show up in more detail in the next certification you see, 
discussing financial controls.
Certification of financial controls
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was passed in response to some nasty corporate 
frauds, and it requires companies to prove that their financial systems work. 
The idea is to make it harder for management to blame low-level employees or 
their own ignorance if a problem crops up. Here’s an example of a certification 
of financial controls, with the standard language in italics and an explanation in 
regular type.
SocialCo, Inc.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting
To the Board of Directors
SocialCo, Inc.
We have audited SocialCo, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated 
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). SocialCo, Inc.’s management is 
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, 

58
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial 
reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion 
on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, or COSO, is a group of accounting 
and financial trade groups, such as the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants. It’s been around since 1985 and gained power after the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act was passed when accounting firms and corporate executives started 
paying attention to the need for effective accounting systems.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board. Those standards require that we 
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all 
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal 
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness 
exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other 
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe 
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Here, the accounting firm describes a bit of what it did to determine whether 
the company’s accounting process comes up with accurate numbers.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A 
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and 
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable 
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts 
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) 
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of 
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Here’s a description of what internal controls do. In simpler terms, having 
good internal controls means that the company has some assurance that the 
numbers being tracked are accurate.

59
 Chapter 4: How to Research Responsible Investments
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation 
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may 
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of 
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The auditors want you to know that even with good internal controls, the 
company can still have fraud.
In our opinion, SocialCo, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective 
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on 
the COSO criteria.
But, with all that being said, the auditor is certifying that the company has 
good financial controls. Now, not all companies do; the standards for internal 
controls are complex, so it’s not unheard of for a good company to miss a few. 
You may arrive at this paragraph and see a qualified statement, explaining that 
the company has good controls except for a new acquisition, except for one 
or two international operations, or except for a new accounting system that’s 
been installed but not yet tested.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated 
balance sheets of SocialCo, Inc. as of December 31, 2006, and December 31, 
2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ 
equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal 
years in the period ended December 31, 2007, of SocialCo, Inc. and our report 
dated December 31, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
And that audit, of course, is the subject of the statement above.

Income statements
The income statement tells how much money the company brought in from 
sales of its goods and services, and how much money it had to spend to get 
those sales. Here’s a sample income statement:

Here’s what you should note while examining the income statement:
 
✓ Sales, also called revenue or turnover, is the money that came in from 
selling the company’s goods and services. The MD&A, described earlier 
in the chapter, usually has a detailed breakout. In most cases, you want 
to see sales go up each year.
 
✓ Cost of goods sold, sometimes abbreviated as COGS, are any expenses 
that can be directly tied to a particular sale. It includes the cost of inven-
tory, sales commissions, and promotional advertising, such as coupons 
that can be redeemed for a specific product. It should stay more or less 
constant, or go down, as a percentage of sales.
 
✓ Gross profit, sometimes called gross margin, is the difference between 
sales and cost of goods. It’s how much money is left over to cover the 
costs of operating and financing the company. You calculate it as a per-
centage by dividing gross profit by sales. The result is a useful number 
for tracking how the profits from sales change over time.
 
 The hardest thing for any company to do is come up with something 
that people will pay money to have. The next hardest thing is to come 
up with something that people will pay enough money for that the busi-
ness costs will be covered. A business’s success hinges on its ability to 
generate sales and manage cost of goods sold.
 
✓ Selling, general, and administrative costs, sometimes called SG&A or 
operating expenses, are the costs of running the business that can’t 
be directly tied to any particular sales. These include the costs of the 
headquarters staff, accounting and legal services, insurance, and other 
expenses. These costs should grow more slowly than sales.

61
 Chapter 4: How to Research Responsible Investments
 
✓ Operating income is gross profit less SG&A. It shows how much money 
the company has to cover its financing, both debt and equity. It’s some-
times called EBIT, for earnings before interest and taxes; yes, people 
really say eee-bit.
 
✓ Interest expense is the money that the company has to pay to anyone 
whom it owes money to: bondholders, banks, suppliers. It should be a 
small percentage of operating income; if the company misses payments 
to anyone who has loaned it money, it may be forced into bankruptcy.
 
✓ Interest and other income is the money that a company makes on its cash 
balances. Some companies have a lot of cash, so they put it on deposit 
or buy short-term bonds and generate interest from those. Companies 
often provide financing to customers, and that generates interest 
income, too.
 
✓ The income tax line isn’t the amount of taxes that the company actually 
pays. Instead, it’s the liability that the company is expected to have, given 
current tax rates. The taxes actually paid are reported in the footnotes to 
the financial statements (I describe footnotes later in the chapter).
 
✓ Net income is how much of the profit is left over for shareholders after inter-
est and taxes are considered. It’s usually divided by the number of shares 
outstanding to generate earnings per share, which is compared to the stock 
price as a way of measuring how cheap a stock is. The higher the price per 
share is relative to earnings per share, the more expensive the stock is.
 
After you look at the annual report and financial statements for a company 
that you’re interested in investing in, check out the annual report of its largest 
competitor, even if you would never consider buying shares in that company. 
The comparison will give you a sense of what your company is doing right, 
where it has room to improve, and where it’s vulnerable.
Balance sheets
The balance sheet tells you what a company owns and what it owes. It has to 
balance, by definition, because every transaction has to have an offsetting 
transaction somewhere else. That’s a useful check for the company’s book-
keepers when they’re looking for errors. By the time the balance sheet gets 
published for your perusal, everything adds up nicely. The only question for 
you is, how strong is it? By that, what are the company’s assets, and how 
are they financed? What follows is a sample balance sheet for the fictitious 
SocialCo Inc., and the following sections tell you what you need to know 
while reviewing it.

 Chapter 4: How to Research Responsible Investments
Assets
The first part of the balance sheet is the firm’s assets, which are all the things 
that it owns, listed in order from short term to long term. The first group, 
known as current assets, are those that are cash or that can be turned into 
cash quickly. These include
 
✓ Cash and equivalents (such as bank CDs) are listed first, followed by 
short-term investments, such as Treasury notes, that can be converted 
to cash in short order. Some cash is good; too much means there’s a risk 
of management doing something stupid with it.
 
✓ Accounts receivable is money owed to the firm by customers. Many firms 
sell items long before customers pay for them. For example, you use 
electricity, the electric company sends you a bill, and then you have a 
few weeks to pay it. The billing starts when you flip the switch the first 
day of the new billing period, but payment may not be received until 
almost two months later. Some customers are deadbeats; if receivables 
increase faster than sales, there may be a problem.
 
✓ Inventory is those goods held for sale. They may be items in stores right 
now, items still being assembled, or components that will be assembled. 
It is hoped that all of these things will be sold and turned into cash, 
but it may not happen right away or at the price the company hopes to 
achieve. No matter what it cost to produce VHS tapes, who wants to pay 
full price for them today? Inventory should grow at about the same rate 
as sales.
 
✓ Prepaid expenses show up when the company pays its bills in advance. 
Maybe its landlord offers management a deal if it pays its rent for the 
year all at once, or maybe the utility company has allowed the company 
to lock in rates in exchange for an advance payment.
 
✓ I mention in the section on the income statement that the tax expense 
on that document isn’t necessarily the amount of taxes that the 
company paid. In some cases, the company has paid more than the 
income statement shows. If the overpayment will be resolved soon, say 
if the company can apply it to its income tax bill next quarter, then it’s a 
deferred tax asset treated as a prepaid expense.
After the current assets, the company reports the longer-term ones. These 
are items that are more permanent in nature:
 
✓ Property, plant, and equipment, sometimes shown under the abbreviation 
PP&E, includes land, buildings, and machinery ranging from giant cranes 
to desktop printers. Each year, the company has to expense a portion of 
the value of buildings and equipment to show how they are wearing out; 

64
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing
this is known as depreciation. The balance sheet shows the value after 
depreciation. Land isn’t depreciated, but it’s shown at the price paid, 
which may not be the current value. Because of how the accounting for 
PP&E works, the value may not tell you much about the company.
 
✓ Goodwill is a funny number. It’s the difference between the price that 
a company pays for an acquisition and the net value of the acquired 
business’s balance sheet. It’s supposed to represent the added value 
of brand names, customer relationships, and other business niceties. It 
rarely tells you much about the company.
 
✓ Intangible assets are patents, trademarks, customer lists, and other items 
that are important to the business’s success. But here’s the thing: In most 
cases, intangibles only show up on the balance sheet when they’ve been 
acquired, because that’s the only easy way to assign a value to them.
 
 Coca-Cola’s (NYSE: KO) secret formula has no value for accounting 
purposes. The only way an accountant could give it value would be for 
the company to try to sell it; then the buyer would be able to record the 
price paid as an intangible asset. Whether your beverage of choice is 
Coke or Pepsi (NYSE: PEP), it’s clear that that secret blend of ingredients 
is worth a heck of a lot more than the zero value that Coke has to use. 
That’s the problem with intangible assets.
 
✓ Deferred income taxes sometimes make an appearance as a long-term 
asset. These are taxes paid over and above what was reported on the 
income statement. Long-term deferred income tax assets may never be 
recovered. On the other hand, many companies pay less in taxes than 
is shown on the income statement. That creates a deferred tax liabil-
ity that may never be paid. Check the footnotes to find out how much 
money a company actually pays in taxes.
Liabilities
The liabilities section of the balance sheet tells what the company owes. As 
with the assets section, it’s arranged in order from current — due in less than 
a year — to noncurrent. Here’s what you may see:
 
✓ Current installments of long-term debt and leases are payments that are 
due in a year. For example, you may have a 30-year mortgage, but each 
time you make a payment, you pay down a little bit of the principal. It’s 
your very own current installment on a long-term debt. Compare this to 
the cash balance to get a sense of how easy it will be for the company to 
make the payment.
 
✓ Accounts payable are bills that the company owes. If the company 
doesn’t pay its bills, then it has more cash, but at some point, the elec-
tric company comes in and turns off the lights if the bills aren’t paid. 
Anytime a supplier sends a bill, an account payable is created, and it 
stays on the balance sheet until the bill is paid. Some payables are good, 
but if the amount grows much faster than sales, the company may not 
be paying its bills.

65
 Chapter 4: How to Research Responsible Investments
 
✓ Most employees are paid every two weeks or once a month, even though 
they come to work every day. Until payday, a liability for accrued payroll 
and benefits shows up on the balance sheet.
 
✓ Dividends payable shows dividends that have been declared to share-
holders but not yet paid. Not all companies pay dividends, so not all 
companies will have this line on their balance sheets.
 
 The difference between current assets and current liabilities is called 
working capital. It’s a measure of cash that has to be invested in the 
business on an ongoing basis to support sales.
 
✓ Long-term debt represents money owed to bondholders, banks, and 
other creditors. It all has to be paid back, but it’s not necessarily bad 
for the company to owe money as long as it generates enough cash each 
year to pay on schedule.
 
✓ Deferred leases are long-term contracts with landlords or equipment 
holders. Accounting rules handle leases differently from debt, but in 
practice, they’re the same: If you don’t pay your mortgage, the bank 
will have you evicted. If you don’t pay your rent, the landlord will do 
the same.
Shareholders equity
The difference between assets and liabilities is the shareholders equity. It’s 
what the shareholders get to keep after all the bills are paid, at least accord-
ing to the values recorded on the balance sheet. The total value matters 
more to you than any of the line items, but here’s the play-by-play so you 
know what’s happening:
 
✓ Par value is a minimum value of the shares. Many companies set the par 
value of the shares at just a penny; some don’t even bother with a par 
value.
 
✓ Additional paid-in capital is the value of the shares over and above the 
par value at the time they were issued. It’s an historical number.
 
✓ Treasury stock is the value of any shares that the company bought back 
in the open market. It represents a reduction in equity.
 
✓ Retained earnings are the total value of profits that the company earned 
on the income statement, minus the amount of any dividends paid.
Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows is one of the most mysterious of the financial 
statements, but it’s also really important. It tells you how much of a com-
pany’s sales bring in cash, and how much of a company’s expenditures send 
out cash.

66
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing
Many customers make purchases with no money upfront, which affects the 
cash flow. For example, many appliance retailers allow customers to wait six 
months before making a payment, with no interest charged in between. That’s 
because a lot of people have to buy an appliance on short notice to replace one 
that stopped working, and demanding payment upfront may be the difference 
between getting a sale and losing it to a competitor. The retailer can book the 
sale to revenue when it takes place, but it won’t collect the cash for 180 days. 
And that can be a problem if the company needs the money in the meantime.
The statement of cash flows is broken down into three sections:
 
✓ Cash from operating activities, which shows how much money was 
generated from the company’s basic business
 
✓ Cash from investing activities, which shows spending on property, plant, 
and equipment
 
✓ Cash from financing activities, which explains how the company raises 
money or returns it to shareholders
Following is an example of cash flows from financing activities. The following 
sections tell you what you should look for on the statement of cash flows.

Cash flows from operating activities
The difference between making the sale and collecting the cash shows up on the 
statement of cash flows. It starts with net income, and then adds and subtracts 
different values to show how much net income was turned into cash. It also 
explains the changes in values on the balance sheet from one year to the next.
The first item to be added back to net income is depreciation and amortization, 
the gradual write-down of the company’s buildings, equipment, and intangible 
assets. This is an accounting charge that doesn’t use up any cash.
The next set of numbers shows the changes in current assets and current 
liabilities. If a company were able to get out of paying cash by drawing on a 
prepaid expense account or letting its accounts payables build, then there 
is an addition to cash on the statement of cash flows. If the company spent 
cash, say to buy more inventory, then there is a subtraction to cash. There will 
also be a subtraction to cash if the company booked a lot of sales on credit, 
because it will take a while for the customers to pay for their purchases.
The bottom line for this section is net cash from operations, and it tells you if 
the company’s business is bringing in cash or using it up. Over the long run, 
this number has to be positive or the company can’t stay in business. When 
a company is expanding, it may have negative cash from operations as it 
spends on inventory and extends credit to more customers. When a company 
is running into trouble, it may also have negative cash from operations, so 
check to see where your business is.
Cash flows from investing activities
In order to grow, businesses have to invest. They have to spend money on 
the equipment that employees need to get their jobs done. They may need to 
add more office space or larger manufacturing facilities. The company may 
even want to acquire another business. All of that shows up in this section as 
cash spent.

68
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing
A larger business might sell off a division or major equipment, and that 
would show up as an inflow of cash. You’ll often see purchases and sales of 
available-for-sale securities and other cash equivalents, such as U.S. govern-
ment securities, in this section. If a company has no immediate use for excess 
cash, it might invest it to get a higher return.
This section of the statement of cash flows will usually be negative, and that’s 
okay. Smart investments can help a company be around for the long haul. In 
fact, a company that’s not spending enough on investments won’t be able to 
sustain its business.
Cash flows from financing activities
This section of the statement of cash flows shows how the company is get-
ting the money it needs, other than the money that it is generating from 
operations. If the company pays a dividend, buys back stock, or pays off its 
debt, then it’s spending cash for financing purposes. If it takes on more debt 
or issues new stock, whether through something big like a public offering or 
something small like employee stock benefits, then it’s receiving cash.
The bottom line
Finally, after going through all three sections, the company reports its net 
change in cash for the year. Over several years, it should be slightly positive. 
If a company has too much cash, it should be paying dividends, buying back 
stock, or investing in the business. If it is short of cash, it won’t be in busi-
ness much longer.
 
No matter how much you love a company’s mission and business, if it can’t make 
money, it’s a bad investment. It won’t improve just because you want it to.
Footnotes
The footnotes to the financial statements are like a treasure map. Following 
the footnotes can be tedious, but that’s how you get to where all the good 
stuff is hidden.
Like what? Like how much money the company actually paid in taxes. How 
much money it owes its employee pension plan. Whether it has pending law-
suits that could hurt it. When its debts come due. What kinds of debts — like 
leases — that it has that aren’t reported on the balance sheet.
 
It’s worth the slog through the bog of legalese. Many times, good news or bad 
news is leaked in the footnotes to those who bother to read them.

69
 Chapter 4: How to Research Responsible Investments
Perusing the Precious Proxy
Each year, companies send their shareholders statements of issues for them 
to vote on. Proxies are important sources of information that you can consult 
before you invest. Chapter 5 tells you everything you need to know about 
using proxies to create change.
Just like annual reports, proxies are public information that must be filed 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can often get them from 
the company, even if you aren’t a shareholder, or you can go to the SEC’s 
Web site, www.sec.gov. Proxies contain three key tidbits of interest to 
prospective investors:
 
✓ Who the members of the board of directors are
 
✓ What potential conflicts of interest exist that might cloud the executives’ 
or the board members’ judgments
 
✓ How much money the executives make
Board of directors’ information
Legally, companies are owned by shareholders who elect a board of directors 
that oversees the work of management. The proxy is the medium for electing 
the board, so the proxy statement includes biographical information about 
the people in the running. Look it over: Do these seem like people who under-
stand business, finance, and the company’s industry? You can even do a little 
Web searching on the names, if you’re so inclined.
 
Don’t be misled by celebrity names on boards. You want to see that the board 
has members who understand their responsibilities and who have the time to 
do the work. Some boards nominate glamorous people, maybe because the 
other board members want to hobnob. Now, a celebrity may well be able to 
do the job, but do your research to make sure.
After the Who’s Who will be a description of the board’s committees, with 
members specializing in compensation, audit, and nominating. Toward the 
end, you’ll see a sentence or two about how often the board members went 
to meetings. Most governance experts believe that a board member needs to 
attend at least 75 percent of all meetings to provide good guidance.
Finally, check out the section entitled something like “Committee Interlocks 
and Related Transactions,” which tells you if the board members have any 
conflicts of interest. A common issue is compensation, because the CEO may 
well be on a board determining compensation for a board member who is an 
officer at another company. Then both would have incentives to push for big 

70
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing
raises and little oversight. You may also see board members arranging jobs 
for their children, receiving significant discounts on products that the com-
pany sells, or working for customers. Then decide: Are these conflicts great 
enough that the board member may not be making good decisions for me?
Checking out how much the execs make
The fun part of the proxy is the section on executive compensation. It usually 
starts with a description of the company’s philosophy: Is it to be an industry 
leader in all aspects, including executive pay? Is the goal to reward top per-
formers? Share gains with all employees? Maintain equity? Promote loyalty? 
Provide incentives? These different attitudes affect the way that people at all 
levels are paid. No system is right or wrong, but the choice affects the organi-
zation’s culture. It may also affect the company’s performance, depending on 
what market conditions it faces.
Following the discussion of how the firm approaches pay, the proxy includes 
a description of employee stock option programs and other incentive com-
pensation that involves stock. Shareholders care because new stock issued 
reduces the percentage of the firm that other shareholders have. They want 
to know if the performance incentives offset that dilution.
The proxy then lists the compensation of the five most highly paid officers in 
the firm, as well as the compensation for members of the board of directors 
and the chairman of the board, if the chairman isn’t also an executive.
 
Only the executives’ compensation has to be disclosed, even though some 
companies have a few employees who make more than the CEO. The SEC has 
proposed the so-called “Katie Couric Rule” that would require companies to 
also disclose the compensation of employees who earn more than the CEO, 
named for the most highly paid staffer at CBS Corporation (NYSE: CBS). At 
press time, the rule hadn’t passed.
There’s nothing wrong with executives making a lot of money as long as 
they’re generating results for shareholders and as long as all employees are 
compensated for their work, too. There’s a problem if the executives get fat 
raises while everyone else sees their returns go down.
In my opinion, the best part of the proxy statement’s discussion of compen-
sation is usually found near the end under the heading “Certain Relationships 
and Related Transactions.” Here, the executives disclose any conflicts of 
interest they may have, which can range from owning the office building that 
the company leases for its headquarters to giving their children summer 
jobs. Most of these conflicts at most companies are minor, but on occasion, 
you’ll see conflicts that are so large that it’s as if management has contempt 
for the shareholders.

 Chapter 4: How to Research Responsible Investments
Staying Up-to-Date
The annual report and the proxy tell you the general state of the company at 
the end of the last fiscal year. But a lot can happen in the intervening 365 — 
or 360 — days between annual reports. If you’re considering investing in a 
company, you should check out the latest facts. If you own a security, staying 
on top of the news should be a priority. You can get some of the information 
from the company in yet more SEC filings, and the rest you can find from 
reading the news.
Reviewing quarterly reports (10Q)
Every three months, publicly traded companies have to update shareholders 
on their progress. They usually issue a news release and hold a conference 
call, but the minimum requirement is to file a quarterly report on form 10Q 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can get the 10Q from the 
company or from the SEC’s Web site, www.sec.gov.
The 10Q is similar in format to the 10K report but much less detailed. It 
includes a discussion of what has changed over the quarter, and then 
includes quarterly financial statements with footnotes. The presentation 
may have fewer lines than in the annual report, and it isn’t audited by any 
accounting firms, but it should give you enough information to determine 
how your company is doing relative to the same time period last year.
 
Most companies have seasonal businesses. Most retailers, for example, post 
almost all of their sales in December. Hospitals show more admissions in 
winter months, because of flu and pneumonia, than they do in the summer. 
That’s why you need to compare quarterly results to the same quarter a year 
ago rather than to the quarter that just passed.
Listening in on conference calls
Many companies hold a conference call for analysts and investors after they 
report their earnings each quarter. One or two of the senior executives go 
through the results and explain what happened (with a hefty dose of positive 
spin, natch), and then take questions. In most cases, only analysts and insti-
tutional investors invited by the company can ask questions, but anyone can 
listen. Companies usually announce these calls on their Web site. If you miss 
the call, most companies then post a recording or a transcript on their Web 
sites. (Companies don’t have to have conference calls, but if they do, they are 
required to make the information available to all investors.)

72
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing
These calls are great sources of information about where the business is 
headed. The questions — and the answers — give you a good sense of what 
concerns experienced analysts have about the financial results and the pros-
pects for the future. The managers answering the questions may be cheery, 
candid, evasive, or even a combination of the three. The information helps 
you track the progress of the business, or find out where it’s been and where 
it’s going if you’re a prospective shareholder.
Viewing investor presentations
When you’re checking out the investor section of the company’s Web site, 
you may see some presentations that company executives have given to 
groups of investors, usually at brokerage firm conferences. The brokers host-
ing these meetings only invite their large clients, so you probably can’t get 
in. However, the SEC requires presenting companies to share their presenta-
tions with all investors through transcripts, Webcasts, or slide shows that 
you can find on their Web sites.
As with the conference calls (see the preceding section), there will be a lot of 
happy talk about how the company is the best at everything. You’ll also get 
some data and news updates that can give you a sense of how the company 
is progressing toward its targets. You can use the information to decide if 
you want to buy, sell, or hold.
Checking up on current 
report filings (8K)
If a company has significant news to announce between the due dates for 
its 10K and 10Q filings, the SEC has it issue an 8K report, also called a current 
report of material events or corporate changes. An 8K may contain informa-
tion about a management change, a disaster at an operating facility, the 
announcement of a major new product, or the outcome of a pending lawsuit.
In most cases, the company also issues a press release that you can find 
online (I cover how to use news databases and other online resources later 
in the chapter). The 8K filing ensures that the news announcement becomes 
part of a company’s permanent record, available to everyone through the 
SEC, no matter what happens to the press release or other news archives.

73
 Chapter 4: How to Research Responsible Investments
Poring over the prospectuses
Whenever a company issues a significant amount of new securities, it has to 
issue a prospectus. It looks a lot like a 10K report with even more information 
about the history of the business and the qualifications of the management 
team. Some companies issue only one prospectus at the time of the initial 
public offering and never issue another. Other companies may do another 
public offering of stock, issue public bonds, and make large acquisitions by 
using enough stock that a prospectus has to be printed.
 
The company that you’re researching may not have any prospectuses. But if it 
does, be sure to read the most recent one to help you decide if the investment 
will help you meet your financial and social objectives.
Stock prospectuses
When a company issues stock for the first time in an initial public offering 
(IPO), it has to issue a prospectus on SEC form S1. This sets out the compa-
ny’s history, gives detailed biographical information on the senior managers 
and board members, and describes its industry in depth. The idea is to give 
an investor every bit of information needed to make a smart investment deci-
sion. The prospectus stays on file whether or not the company goes through 
with the offering.
After a company goes public, it may issue small amounts of stock through 
employee option and purchase plans or through small acquisitions. A pro-
spectus isn’t required for those, although other SEC filings might be.
Some companies make other large offerings of stock after the IPO, referred to 
as a follow-on offering if new shares are issued or as a secondary offering if cur-
rent owners are selling large blocks of stock. For these, a new prospectus has 
to be filed on form S3. This prospectus has a little more information than the 
most recent 10K report, but it’s not as large as an IPO prospectus.
If a company does a major acquisition and has to issue stock to do it, it will 
issue an S3 prospectus, possibly in combination with a proxy if current 
shareholders have to vote on the deal. This prospectus describes the com-
bined business, including pro forma financial statements that show what the 
financial results would look like if the companies were already combined. It’s 
usually the best source of information about how a merger will work.
Debt prospectuses
Many companies issue publicly traded bonds. They usually do this through a 
shelf registration, which means they can file a bond offering with the SEC and 

74
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing
then sell the bonds as they need to in order to raise the money. A company 
may file to offer $100 million in debt, and then find that it makes the most 
sense to issue $50 million now and another $50 million in six months.
If the company’s stock is already public, it can usually make the offering 
under form FWP, which stands for free-writing prospectus and really isn’t a 
form at all. It’s a supplementary statement that explains what the offering is 
and how the securities will work without going into details about the com-
pany and its history, which are available from other filings.
If a company doesn’t have public stock but wants to issue public bonds, it 
has to issue a prospectus with similar information as with a stock offering. 
Most private companies that want to issue debt usually choose to do a pri-
vate placement instead; the offering prospectus doesn’t have to be filed with 
the SEC, but only high-net-worth investors can buy the bonds.
Mutual fund prospectuses
Open-end mutual funds issue new shares every day to people who want to 
invest in them. They are sold through prospectuses which are updated at 
least once a year.
A mutual fund prospectus is a little different from a company prospectus. 
Instead of giving an extensive history of the fund, it explains what the fund 
is like right now. It usually starts with an overview of the fund’s investment 
objectives and the strategy it will use to meet them, including what types of 
securities the fund managers will look at and what criteria they will use to 
select them. The prospectus usually describes the amount of risk the fund is 
expected to have so investors can determine if it matches their desires.
The fund will also have information about historic performance, as well as 
a detailed discussion of the types and amounts of fees that are charged. 
Chapter 13 has a lot of information on how to assess different mutual funds.
Google and More: Doing a News Search
The SEC filings contain a ridiculous amount of information about a company, 
but it’s all from the company’s perspective. That doesn’t mean that it’s wrong 
or misleading, but other people outside of the company have different per-
spectives on the business.
Besides the major newspapers (The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, 
The Financial Times), many companies are covered in great depth by the 
media of the town where the headquarters is. Some companies are followed 
by bloggers who are obsessed with the good, the bad, and everything in 
between. And sometimes, interesting tidbits about the company come up 
when you least expect them.

75
 Chapter 4: How to Research Responsible Investments
Hence, investors need to be comfortable with online research! Several finan-
cial sites let you monitor stock prices during the day, and many of these sites 
carry press releases announcing corporate news. A simple query through any 
of the popular search sites can turn up information that you may not have 
considered.
 
Google offers a service called Google Alerts (www.google.com/alerts) 
that lets you place your search terms on file. You’ll then receive an e-mail 
whenever a site with those terms comes up on Google.
But that may not be enough for you. You may also want to consider search-
ing blogs through a service like Technorati (technorati.com); you may 
even uncover a few related to your investments or to your social activism 
style that you want to monitor regularly.
Major news databases, such as LexisNexis (www.lexisnexis.com) or ABI/
INFORM (www.proquest.com), can help you find articles in smaller newspa-
pers, trade magazines, and other publication that may not offer online access 
to their archives. Subscriptions to these services are pricey, but most public 
libraries have subscriptions. Your library may allow you to get access to 
these databases through its Web site by using your library card. Mine does! 
Your friendly local librarian may subscribe to other investment databases 
that you can use to help you find out more about companies before you 
invest in them.
Narrowing Your Research with Screening
Are you wondering how to turn your newfound knowledge and all the infor-
mation you’ve gathered into investment action? One way is through screen-
ing. With a screen, you set the criteria for your investment, and then you 
check several companies at once to see which fit and which don’t.
Plugging numbers or criteria into a screen
The traditional way to screen is to set up a spreadsheet and enter the data 
that you’ve uncovered in your research. Then take your spreadsheet and sort 
and analyze the data to find investment opportunities that work for you. It’s 
effective, but it’s also a lot of work.
The good news is you don’t have to do the screening yourself. If you’re 
investing through a brokerage firm, most of them have screening capabilities 
that their customers can use. Or, if you’re a do-it-yourselfer, you can fire up 
your computer and use one of the online screening services:

76
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing
 
✓ Google Finance (finance.google.com/finance/stockscreener) 
has a screen to help you select stocks.
 
✓ Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) has basic stock and mutual fund 
screeners for free; more powerful ones are available by subscription.
 
✓ MSN MoneyCentral (moneycentral.msn.com/investor/finder/
customstocksdl.asp) has a basic stock screener that looks at valuation.
 
✓ Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com) offers screening for stocks, 
bonds, and mutual funds.
Most screening systems are set up so you enter the criteria that matters to 
you, and then wait for the system to generate a list of companies that match. 
A good screen is primarily financial; it may look for companies that are 
expected to grow, that are really cheap, or both. Most screeners have few 
social criteria, although there may be some information on industries, gover-
nance, or other criteria.
Table 4-1 shows the result of a screen I ran on general entertainment com-
panies that had at least some inside ownership (to show employee engage-
ment), positive operating cash flow (to demonstrate financial stability), and 
expected revenue growth next year. It came back with five stocks for me to 
consider. I can export the information into a spreadsheet, where I can add 
columns with other statistics that may be important to me.

If your criteria are too high, you may not end up with any results. My first few 
versions of this screen had higher thresholds for inside ownership and cash 
flow; they returned no stocks. I had to be less particular in order to have 
something to show you!
 
Double-check the data in a screen before you buy or sell any security based 
on the results. The results can be thrown off by fiscal years that don’t match 
calendar years, acquisitions, one-time transactions, or unusual accounting 
methods. If the screen generates the name of an intriguing company, the next 
step is to read the financial statements.
Combining the results with 
additional research
Screening is both positive and negative. Negative screening helps you rule 
out investments that won’t work for you. Positive screening helps you find 
opportunities that meet your criteria that you may not have known about 
otherwise.
Social investors may have a positive attitude about changing the world, but 
their investing usually starts with negative screening. That is, they rule out 
companies, industries, and types of investments that don’t fit their values. 
Whether it’s an entertainment company that started a soft-core porn cable 
channel, the defense industry, or bonds, some investors won’t touch certain 
companies or investment vehicles. Assuming that you haven’t narrowed the 
field to exclude everything, what you have left — family entertainment com-
panies, the entire S&P 500 excluding military contractors, stocks — can be 
sorted through with positive screening.
Few software packages can handle extensive negative screening. They may 
not catch that pork-processing division that generates 8 percent of revenues 
or that employee benefit plan that you’re not happy about. That’s why you 
have to do some of your negative screening manually by doing your research.
 
What the screen doesn’t tell you, the 10K report will. (See the earlier section, 
“Reading and Understanding an Annual Report (10K),” for more details about 
these reports.)
Instead of trying to rule out companies, many social investors run positive 
screens. It’s also called inclusion or the “best in class” approach. The idea is 
to seek out companies that fit your social goals. Like negative screening, it 
usually means doing research to find the information you need to make the 
right decision.

78
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing
 
You may be able to simplify your screening by working with the companies in 
a socially responsible index that matches your style. Identify the index, get the 
list of securities included in it (usually available from the index publisher’s 
Web site), and use that as a starting point for further screening. Chapter 13, 
which covers exchange-traded funds, has information on some of the different 
social indexes that they’re based on.

A
ctivist investing is just that: Active. It’s not only about finding 
investments that match your interests, but also about trying to change 
the world for the better. After all, for many, money is about the best incentive 
out there! Companies respond to it just like people do. That’s the whole point 
of our fabulous capitalist system. Hence, social investors who can make the 
case for change may be amply rewarded. Depending on who they are and 
how much of a security they own, investors can meet with management, 
propose changes, and make them happen. It doesn’t take millions of dollars;
smaller investors can work with others to combine their resources and 
power.
This chapter tells you how to press for changes that can benefit your 
portfolio, other investors, and the world at large. It’s a way of getting closer 
to that proverbial “doing well while doing good.”

Has Anything Changed?
When you make an investment, you consider your needs as well as the 
prospects and benefits of the different investments that you’re considering. 
Ah, but what happens otherwise? Investing, socially responsible or otherwise, 
is an active game. You have to stay on top of what’s happening and then 
decide what you want to do about it.
Things change. All the time. Investments that you once wouldn’t have 
considered may now meet your criteria, while investments that were fine 
fits when you made them may not be performing as you had hoped, either 
financially or socially.
Part of the fun of social investing is the opportunity to create change in the 
world, and that requires paying attention, responding, and maybe even taking 
action to make a difference. In Part II of this book, I cover different styles of 
social investing, and in Part III, I cover the different types of investments that 
social investors can consider. But what happens if, for example, you own stock 
in a company that could be more responsive to shareholders than it is now? 
What if you want a local bank to pay more attention to customers in the local 
community? The following sections help you keep an eye on your investments 
and know what to do if you’re not pleased with the changes you see.
Monitoring your investment
The investment business is all about news and information. Several newspapers, 
such as The Wall Street Journal and Investor’s Business Daily, cover the markets in 
detail. CNBC brings trading news to your TV. Seemingly hundreds of magazines 
cover regional, national, and international business, and almost every town has 
at least one talk radio show where the participants cover investments. Throw in 
all the Web publications, blogs, and discussion boards, and you can find out just 
about anything you want to know.
What you’re looking for in all this information is what’s changed. Is the com-
pany still adhering to the values that attracted you to it in the first place? 
Is the investment performing as well as, better than, or worse than you had 
expected? Can you live with the changes, or do they affect how the invest-
ment works within your portfolio? Everything in life changes, after all.
 
Are you overwhelmed? Well, I don’t blame you. There’s a 100-year-flood’s 
worth of information out there, so here are three tips for wading through the 
water:

81
Chapter 5: Lights, Research, Action! Using Your Research to Influence Your Investments
 
✓ Use the free Google Alerts service (www.google.com/alerts) offered 
by the search engine company. You can enter in the search terms that 
you care about, such as the company name and a key issue. Whenever a 
new item using those terms shows up on Google, you’ll receive an e-mail 
so you can check it out.
 
✓ Most Internet portals let you set up your own custom news section to 
bring you stories on the companies or issues that you care about. If you 
use a home or start page offered by your Internet service provider or by 
one of the major news and search companies (Google, Yahoo!, or MSN, 
for example), you should be able to do this.
 
✓ When you start investing, take the time to look through all the different 
news sources out there. Find the two or three magazines, newsletters, 
newspapers, Web sites, or blogs that best fit your style, and then make a 
point of keeping up with them.
Just remember that you’ll probably end up with more stories than you know 
what to do with, so don’t get too excited by headlines; take the time to read 
the article.
 
Naturally, the annual report and any news announcements from the company 
should go into your mix of reading materials. (See Chapter 4 for more on these.)
Deciding on your plan of action
If you notice that your investment isn’t what it once was, then you have to 
decide if you can live with that. If you can, great. But if not, you have three 
choices:
 
✓ Get more information.
 
✓ Divest the security.
 
✓ Try to create change.
You may want to start by getting more information about the situation. 
Oftentimes, business news is a cycle of rumors in the market countered with 
spin by the PR managers of the companies involved, and it can take a while to 
sort out what’s really happening. Keep digging, using resources listed in the 
“Monitoring your investment” section or in Chapter 4 to look for confirma-
tion or context for the news. After all, the company has an incentive to make 
everything look good, but others can have axes to grind and use them to take 
unfair slices at a company’s reputation and valuation.

82
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
In some cases, you may decide to sell, to divest of the security completely to 
get it out of your portfolio and move on. This option is especially attractive if 
the investment’s financial outlook isn’t looking so hot. You may end up incur-
ring a tax liability, but you’d have to pay taxes on a gain someday anyway.
But what if you have owned the security for a very long time and would have 
enormous tax liability if you were to sell? And what if the investment’s finan-
cial prospects are excellent? Then sticking to your principles isn’t so easy. 
Still, holding your position doesn’t mean selling out your values. You may be 
able to influence the company management. How? Well, keep reading!
Creating the Change You Want
Many investors become activists because they’re not happy with how their 
investments are performing on measures both monetary and moral. Other 
investors are activists from the get-go; they’re willing to buy securities that 
don’t meet their needs with the explicit goal of trying to force change. This is 
especially true of investors interested in corporate governance (covered in 
Chapter 7). It’s a risky strategy because it may be difficult to get the changes 
made that you want, and in the meantime, you may be stuck with an invest-
ment that is contrary to your ideas.
 
No matter how much your investment means to you, it’s probably small rela-
tive to the entire market for the security. The stock doesn’t know you own it, 
as the traders like to say, and it doesn’t owe you anything. Sometimes your 
best option is to sell.
 
If you want to rev the change engine, first identify a company that has a spe-
cific problem that causes it to behave irresponsibly and affects performance. 
For example, maybe the company is losing market share because it’s making 
products that use a lot of energy when they’re used. This is one use of the 
research techniques covered in Chapter 4.
Next, find out information about the other investors in the fund. The proxy 
statement will tell you which shareholders own more than 5 percent of the 
stock, as well as how much stock senior executives and members of the 
board own. If employees and board members control a lot of the stock, they 
may be less open to the involvement of outside shareholders than if they 
own very little.
Many institutional investors, especially mutual funds, have to disclose their 
holdings in companies. You can find that information on quotation systems, 
such as Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com), when you look up the com-
pany’s price quote. You can get a sense of how involved the shareholders 

83
Chapter 5: Lights, Research, Action! Using Your Research to Influence Your Investments
are. (For example, if the holders are equity index funds, then the fund manag-
ers aren’t going to investment conferences and meeting with management. If 
the holders are affiliated with socially responsible mutual fund companies, 
then they are almost definitely engaged.)
If you think the people who are investing in the company are pushing for 
change, then your quest to buy the stock in anticipation of change may be 
more successful.
Making your votes count at meetings
Shareholders own the company, managers work for shareholders, directors 
monitor managers, and the purpose of the company is to maximize share-
holder value. Those concepts are taught in the very first session of the most 
basic corporate finance course, and yet, they don’t always play out in the real 
world.
As a small shareholder, the company may not even know your name; your 
stock may well be held in street name, which is the name of your brokerage 
firm. Nevertheless, you can let yourself be known and get your questions 
answered. All public companies publish financial reports and hold annual 
shareholder meetings, and many of them hold periodic conference calls, 
attend conferences, and accept questions and comments from shareholders.
Attending annual meetings
Each public company is required by law to hold an annual meeting. During 
this meeting, the management gives a report to the board and the sharehold-
ers, and shareholder votes are tallied. Shareholders are invited to the meet-
ing and can vote on issues there instead of submitting proxies (see the next 
section for more on proxies). The agenda, issued on SEC Form DEF 14A (also 
known as the proxy statement), includes time for shareholder questions.
Annual meetings can range from perfunctory two-hour meetings in a com-
pany conference room to the days-long extravaganza of shopping, softball, 
and steak put on by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A), the investment com-
pany controlled by Warren Buffett. Most shareholders skip annual meetings, 
but folks located in the town where the meeting is held or who have a strong 
stake in an issue (financial or otherwise) may want to attend.
Information about the date, time, and location of the annual meeting is on 
the first page of the proxy statement, and you should receive it in plenty 
of time to book your trip. In many cases, annual meetings are open only to 
shareholders, and to attend you may be given a ticket, asked to register in 
advance, or be required to show a brokerage statement.

84
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
 
Any material information discussed at the annual meeting is released to the 
public, but that doesn’t mean that the general public is allowed to attend the 
meeting.
 
Although the Internal Revenue Service allows investors to write off many 
investment expenses, trips to annual meetings aren’t included. Why? The IRS 
was concerned that people were buying one or two shares of stock in compa-
nies headquartered in resort areas, and then planning vacations around the 
annual meeting in order to write off their trip.
Voting proxies
Few shareholders attend annual meetings, but that doesn’t mean they give up 
their say. In fact, that’s why the DEF 14A filing is known as a proxy statement: 
Investors who don’t attend the annual meeting use it to make their votes 
known in advance.
These votes are cast by proxy, which means the shareholders authorize 
someone else, usually a designated member of the management team, to reg-
ister their votes at the annual meeting. (And don’t worry, the votes are cast 
as you request! Proxy votes are audited and reported.)
The DEF 14A includes information about the members of the board of direc-
tors and the company’s senior executives, including the amount of stock that 
each owns. It describes key board policies and committee assignments, gives 
a report on the management compensation program, and lists any share-
holder proposals.
 
Want to know which board member has a child who received a highly paid 
summer internship, which executive’s spouse provides interior decorating 
services at above-market rates, and how much everyone used the company’s 
jet for personal use? Then read the proxy statement. It will give you a good 
sense of the norms within the organization that may or may not benefit share-
holders. (Because proxies are such valuable sources of information about a 
company, I cover them in more detail in Chapter 4.)
The key issues on which shareholders vote are:
 
✓ Members of the board of directors, who by law are to represent the 
interests of shareholders and provide oversight to management.
 
✓ The company’s audit firm. Only a handful of firms handle most of the 
audits of U.S. companies. By necessity, shareholders almost always have 
to approve the firm recommended by the board.
 
✓ Executive compensation packages, especially those that involve the 
issuance of stock directly or through options.
 
✓ Proposals that shareholders — including you — may have brought 
to the board. You can find out more about shareholder proposals and 
resolutions later in the chapter.

85
Chapter 5: Lights, Research, Action! Using Your Research to Influence Your Investments
Most companies allow for statutory voting, which gives you one vote per issue 
per share held. On each issue, you can vote for or against, or you can abstain. 
If you don’t make a choice, management will vote for you, and you can guess 
whose interests they’ll be representing. Investors who have fiduciary respon-
sibilities, such as pension fund managers, are required to vote proxies. It’s a 
good idea for you to do so as well.
Some companies allow shareholders to engage in cumulative voting, some-
times called preference voting. That means you can allocate your votes among 
different board candidates, depending on how strongly you feel about each. 
If you own 100 shares and four candidates are running, you have 400 votes. 
You can give them all to one candidate or divide them among the group. This 
gives activist shareholders more power because they can concentrate their 
votes to get a new person added to the board.
You may know how you want to vote based on your own research. A few

If you own a mutual fund, you receive a proxy on issues related to the mutual 
fund itself. The fund’s managers, in turn, are responsible for voting proxies on 
each of the securities held. Each fund has to disclose how it voted on issues. 
If you feel strongly about an issue, call or write to the fund to let the manage-
ment know. It may not affect the vote, but it doesn’t hurt to let the fund com-
pany know you’re paying attention.
Counting on conferences 
and conference calls
Securities laws require companies to report a great deal of financial informa-
tion. Most companies have figured out that if they disclose more than the 
minimum requirements, they’ll have happier shareholders and possibly a 
higher security price.
The cornerstone of most investor relations programs is the quarterly earn-
ings conference call. Companies have to announce their financial results each 
quarter, and many managers use that as an opportunity to give shareholders 
an update on what’s happening. (Otherwise, the shareholders may reach 
their own conclusions, and that may not be good for management!) Many 
hold conference calls.
If a company holds these calls, then anyone must be allowed to listen to 
them. Most use Webcasting technology, linking to their calls through their 
Web sites and then making recordings available after the calls are over. 

86
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
During these calls, the senior executives review financials, discuss their per-
spectives, and then take questions from listeners. It’s one opportunity to get 
in front of managers.
 
Individual investors aren’t always allowed to ask questions on these calls. But 
if you have a question, chances are good that someone else does, too. By lis-
tening, you can find out more about the company and, quite possibly, receive 
an answer to your concern.
Many companies appear at investor conferences throughout the year. Some 
of these are by invitation only (say, only for certain major customers at major 
brokerage firms), but others are open to anyone. Sometimes the organizer 
charges a fee; sometimes they’re free.
Companies also announce these appearances on the investor relations sec-
tion of their Web sites, and they make the presentations available afterward. 
You can find a list of some conferences later in this chapter.
Joining with other investors
Here’s the bad news about being an activist investor: You are just one inves-
tor among very, very many. Even Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, is 
dwarfed by other holders of the company’s stock (including the charitable 
foundation that he founded). Company management doesn’t really care what 
you think unless a lot of other shareholders feel the same way.
 
Keep your shareholdings in perspective. Your position may mean a lot to you, 
but it’s probably small relative to the total number of shares outstanding and 
the stakes held by large mutual fund companies, pension plans, and large 
endowment funds. Unless you own more than 1 percent of the shares out-
standing, it’s best to couch your communications in terms of friendly sugges-
tions and requests for information; managers laugh at the 50-share owner who 
demands satisfaction.
 
Don’t give up hope for change, though. If you join forces with other investors, 
you may be able to get management to take notice. There are a lot of ways to 
find these people, too. Some investors use investment message boards, some 
network at investment conferences, and others belong to coalitions of inves-
tors with common goals.
Discussion boards
One way to find like-minded activist investors is online. Every minute of every 
day, message boards hum with news, rumors, and complaints about different 
companies. If several people share the same complaints, they can often band 

87
Chapter 5: Lights, Research, Action! Using Your Research to Influence Your Investments
together, talk to financial journalists, meet with management, create share-
holder resolutions (discussed later in the chapter), and go about convincing 
management to behave in a more responsible manner.
The conversations themselves can spur changes, or at least make manage-
ment aware of what shareholders are thinking. That’s because sometimes 
company managers check out discussion boards to see what concerns 
investors have. And sometimes, company managers participate — often 
anonymously.
Many discussion boards are for traders, who rarely hold a security long 
enough to care about making changes. These boards often charge subscrip-
tion fees that are worth it for the serious trader but not for someone with 
only an occasional interest in market gossip. Investors, with their longer-term 
perspective, may find that the boards I list here (all of which are free) can 
help them find others with a similar view of the world.
 
✓ AOL Finance (money.aol.com): America Online is an old-timer in the 
investor message board game, and it still attracts folks who want to 
gauge what others are saying.
 
✓ Google Finance (finance.google.com): Google Finance offers 
quotations, news, information, and discussion boards about different 
companies.
 
✓ Investor Village (www.investorvillage.com): This Web site 
specializes in financial news and information and is aimed at experienced 
investors. It includes several active message boards.
 
✓ Morningstar (www.morningstar.com): Morningstar’s specialty 
is mutual funds, although the company offers in-depth research of 
common stocks, exchange-traded funds, and general investment issues. 
The site has a discussion board along with its great information.
 
✓ The Motley Fool (boards.fool.com): The Motley Fool is a great 
source of information about all aspects of investing. Its columns, blogs, 
and discussion boards offer plenty of ways for you to bone up on the 
issues and find others who share your point of view.
 
✓ MSN Money (moneycentral.msn.com/community/message/
default.aspx): MSN Money is the financial section of MSN, Microsoft’s 
go-to collection of news and information. It includes discussion boards 
covering different stocks and industries. (Disclosure: MSN Money is one 
of my clients.)
 
✓ Yahoo! Finance (finance.yahoo.com): Yahoo!’s quotation system 
includes extensive information about companies, including message 
boards.

Investment chat rooms and discussion boards can be depressing places, full 
of people insulting each other and lying in an attempt to get the security price 
to move in their favor. Some chat rooms and discussion boards are more help-
ful than others, so tread carefully.
Investor conferences and clubs
Want to get in touch with real, live investors whom you can see and talk, 
rather than type, to? They’re out there! And some of them want to talk to you. 
Investing doesn’t have to be a solitary activity where all interaction occurs 
through a computer screen. It can involve actual conversations between 
living people who want to share ideas and, when necessary, join forces so 
companies will pay attention to them. Activist investors don’t hide. They 
often attend conferences and clubs to gather more information and find 
others who share their concerns.
Investment conferences are a great way to discover what’s new, what’s 
changed, and who’s important in the markets. If you attend one of these con-
ferences, you have plenty of opportunities to rub shoulders with the success-
ful and talk to people who may be interested in shareholder activism.
The downside? Most of these conferences are for institutional investors and 
investment professionals, so they usually take place at expensive hotels and 
have hefty fees (say of $1,000 or more) for attendance.
 
Some conference organizers sell tapes of presentations or offer briefing books 
afterward to those who couldn’t attend, often at a lower cost than a ticket to 
the event. These give you access to the information but not the networking.
Here’s a list of some conference organizers that offer programs for social and 
individual investors:
 
✓ Financial Research Associates (www.frallc.com) puts on conferences 
about different aspects of investing. These take place all over the country 
and have covered such hot topics as faith-based investing, carbon invest-
ing, and sustainable investing. Attendees usually pay high fees, so these 
conferences are good for finding serious investors with serious expense 
accounts.
 
✓ Institutional Investor Events (www.iievents.com), like the name 
indicates, specializes in events for institutions. Individuals willing to 
pay the institutional-sized fees are welcome to attend. Some of the 
conference offerings cover socially responsible investing in all of its 
varied aspects.
 
✓ The Money Show (www.moneyshow.com) operates a series of investor 
conferences all over the country. Some are general; others have themes 
that may interest social investors, such as politics and the stock market. 
Most events are free; some have a relatively low fee; and others take place 
on cruises that are most definitely not free. Of course, each Money Show 

89
Chapter 5: Lights, Research, Action! Using Your Research to Influence Your Investments
features a lot of vendors looking for customers among the investors who 
attend. If you can handle a sales pitch or two, this may be a great way to 
find out more about investing and find other investors who share your 
activist goals.
 
✓ SRI in the Rockies (www.sriintherockies.com) is a big institutional 
investing conference held each fall at resorts in the U.S. or the Canadian 
Rocky Mountains. One of the main sponsors is the Social Investment 
Forum, a trade organization for socially responsible investors, so it 
brings together the big names from the big funds. Like the other institu-
tional conferences, it’s not cheap to attend.
If you’re looking for more regular contact with other investors than you 
can get at a conference, or if you don’t want to spend big bucks to attend 
the intensive institutional meetings, consider joining groups of individual 
investors. You can form an activist investing group on your own, possibly as 
part of a community group or religious organization that you belong to. Or 
you can link up with investor groups where other birds of the social investing 
feather flock together.
 
✓ The National Association of Investors Corporation (www.better-
investing.org) is the umbrella group for most investing clubs. 
Members of these clubs are individual investors who meet regularly, 
contribute a set amount of money each month, research investments, 
and develop an educational program so everyone becomes a better 
investor long after the club disbands. For social investors, club 
members can figure out a strategy for activism as well as for basic 
investing. The NAIC also offers a newsletter, regional chapter meetings, 
and a national conference where investors can network and gain insight.
 
✓ The American Association of Individual Investors (www.aaii.com) 
is for individual investors who want to invest on their own (no clubs 
required!) but who also want to find out more about how to invest well. 
The group publishes newsletters, stock reports, and books aimed at 
helping individuals do as well as the pros. It has several local chapters 
that put on educational and networking events, and it puts on an annual 
conference. Those in-person meetings can help activist investors find 
others with the same interest.
Organized coalitions
Because there is power in numbers, institutional investors often band 
together to promote their concerns to other investors and press companies 
for change. You may find inspiration and ideas from their efforts. If you’re 
involved with an eligible group — maybe you serve on your synagogue’s 
endowment board, for example — you may want to join. If you can’t be a part 
of the direct action, you can certainly use the efforts of these groups to help 
with your own investment choices and activist activities.

90
Part I: Getting Started in Social Investing 
 
✓ CtW Investment Group (www.ctwinvestmentgroup.com): CtW stands 
for Change to Win, and it represents union pension plans with a total 
asset value of about $1.5 trillion. It has no financial responsibility for 
any of these investments, but it does have a mission: to increase returns 
by rooting out companies that have weak management accountability 
and strong conflicts of interest between the managers and the boards of 
directors. CtW publishes lists of target companies, which it then notifies 
of its concerns. It organizes proxy campaigns to encourage shareholders 
to vote for change, and it publishes a blog about activist investing.
 
✓ Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies (www.ceres.
org): The coalition has an awkward name that creates a cute acronym, 
CERES, who is the Roman goddess of agriculture. The group represents 
institutional investors who want to use shareholder activism to improve 
the environment. It accepts donations from individual investors, and the 
Web site carries detailed information about its issues and campaigns 
that you can use to make your own decisions.
 
✓ Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility (www.iccr.org): This 
group represents Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish institutional investor 
groups, including hospital and university endowments, clergy pension 
funds, and affiliated charitable foundations. Only institutions can be full 
members, but the center has a group of advocates, many of whom are 
individual investors, who support its aims. Among their primary issues 
are access to healthcare, food, and water; environmental justice; human 
rights; and the militarization of society. Advocate members receive 
information about the issues and advice on how to participate in differ-
ent investor action programs.
 
✓ Social Investment Forum (www.socialinvest.org): The Social 
Investment Forum Web site has a wealth of information about almost 
every possible aspect of social investing. The group operates as a trade 
organization for people who work in this field, ranging from mutual 
fund companies to corporate lawyers. Membership isn’t cheap; it starts 
at $475 a year for investment professionals. A broker or financial planner 
developing a specialty in the field might be interested, though. Everyone 
can use the Web site.
Nominating members of the board
Most companies allow shareholders to submit names of candidates for the 
board of directors. Some only accept these nominations at shareholder meet-
ings with advance notice, while others solicit letters from shareholders who 
may know of good candidates. The procedures for making nominations are 
listed in the proxy statement.

91
Chapter 5: Lights, Research, Action! Using Your Research to Influence Your Investments
 
A good board member has extensive business experience, sound judgment, 
and the ability to get things done; social investors, of course, would also like 
to see board members who can do the right thing.
Now the reality is that it’s extremely difficult to get a director on the board 
this way. Most companies hire outside search firms that look for experienced 
corporate and civic leaders; it helps if the nominee is known personally to 
someone already on the board or a member of the senior management team. 
However, because you have the right as a shareholder to make a nomination, 
you may want to exercise it, if only to let the existing board know how you feel.
Submitting shareholder resolutions
As part owners of the corporation, shareholders can have their say at the 
annual meeting by filing a shareholder resolution, sometimes called a share-
holder proposal. It costs nothing more than some time and a stamp, although 
you may want to spring for certified mail.
Shareholders filing resolutions must own at least $2,000 worth of stock for at 
least one year and have a letter from the broker attesting to that.
Resolutions should cover issues that affect at least 5 percent of the business. 
You may not be happy that the company generates 1 percent of its sales from 
revenues from a corrupt government, but that’s not enough for a resolution 
asking the company to pull out of that market. Instead, focus on matters of 
policy that affect the broader business. In no case should your resolution ask 
the company to break the law (even if it is for a higher purpose) or to provide 
redress of a specific grievance.
Yes, the company may have really jerked your best friend around when it laid 
him off, and as a shareholder you may want to help, but a resolution asking 
for more severance pay for him will be ignored.
The resolution, which should be no more than 500 words long, should be 
filed 120 days before the proxy statement is published. You can estimate 
this by looking at the prior year’s proxy statement. Sometimes the company 
publishes information about filing resolutions in the proxy to make it easier 
for you.
If your proposal meets Securities and Exchange Commission requirements 
and is not substantially similar to another proposal that someone else 
already submitted, it will appear in the proxy statement and be voted upon at 
the annual meeting. Management doesn’t have to listen, but the process may 
force them to pay attention.

A sample shareholder resolution
Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) had 17 shareholder 
resolutions included in its 2008 proxy statement. 
The proposals ranged widely and included one 
suggesting a change to the company’s bylaws 
to limit the number of shareholder resolu-
tions that could be allowed in any one year! 
Here’s one of the other 16, which may inter-
est you because it raises both environmental 
and governance issues. It was filed by Neva 
Rockefeller Goodwin, a descendent of John 
David Rockefeller, who founded the company 
that became Exxon Mobil after nearly a cen-
tury of acquisitions and restructurings. The 
proposal received only 10.4 percent of the 
votes, so it wasn’t approved. However, given 
Ms. Goodwin’s status as a Rockefeller heir, it 
attracted a lot of attention to the company’s pol-
icies. It also serves as a model for what a good 
shareholder resolution looks like. It’s specific, 
it’s factual, and it addresses matters of policy 
rather than day-to-day operations. More impor-
tant, the resolution makes a business case in 
just 492 words.
“Resolved: Shareholders ask Exxon Mobil 
Corporation’s (‘ExxonMobil’s’) Board of 
Directors to establish a task force, which 
should include both (a) two or more indepen-
dent directors and (b) relevant company staff, 
to investigate and report to shareholders on the 
likely consequences of global climate change 
between now and 2030, for emerging countries, 
and poor communities in these countries and 
developed countries, and to compare these 
outcomes with scenarios in which ExxonMobil 
takes leadership in developing sustainable 
energy technologies that can be used by and 
for the benefit of those most threatened by cli-
mate change. The report should be prepared 
at reasonable expense, omitting proprietary 
information, and should be made available to 
shareholders by March 31, 2009.
SUPPORTING STATEMENT
The April 2007 Fourth Assessment from the 
United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (Working Group II) details the 
potential climate-change-related devastation 
that regions like Africa and Asia will suffer. 
IPCC Chairman Rajendra Pachauri noted that 
‘It’s the poorest of the poor in the world, and 
this includes poor people even in prosperous 
societies, who are going to be the worst hit.’
This view is widely shared. As stated by the 
Prince of Wales Corporate Leaders Group on 
Climate Change, an organization that includes 
AIG, Dupont, and GE, in a November 30, 2007, 
Communiqué: ‘The economic and geopolitical 
costs of unabated climate change could be 
very severe and globally disruptive. All coun-
tries and economies will be affected, but it will 
be the poorest countries that will suffer earliest 
and the most’. As witnessed by the destruction 
brought on by Hurricane Katrina, extreme cli-
mate events can devastate poor communities 
even in the United States.
ExxonMobil often argues that cheap and 
abundant energy is crucial for the economic 
advancement of poor economies. These coun-
tries are forecast, by ExxonMobil and others, 
to contribute the largest increase in energy 
use. However, if, as predicted by ExxonMobil, 
this energy use is based on continued reliance 
on hydrocarbons, we will see an unrelenting 
increase in global CO2 emissions with devas-
tating consequences especially for those who 
are poor in resources and influence, whether 
they live in the rich or the poor countries. To 
the extent that ExxonMobil’s growth continues 
to rely on the sale of hydrocarbon energy to 
emerging markets, it faces a painful paradox 
in the future, and distances itself from its true 
legacy. Part of John D. Rockefeller’s genius was

If All Else Fails, Should You Sue?
If you’ve tried your best to influence a change in the companies you invest 
in, but nothing has worked, you can file a suit against the company as a last 
resort. These suits can be expensive, so they only make sense if there is 
strong evidence that members of the board or management violated their 
fiduciary responsibilities or engaged in outright fraud.
Attorneys often take these cases on contingency, which means that they’re 
paid only if they win, and they need to show significant amounts of damages, 
so the suits are often organized as class actions.
Typically, if a company announces bad news or poor earnings, a lawyer finds 
a wronged shareholder (sometimes via Internet or newspaper ads), and then 
files suit on behalf of that person. If the judge approves the case as a class 
action, then all potentially affected shareholders are notified. They then 
submit proof that they owned the stock during the time period in question. 
If the company is found guilty or reaches a settlement, all the shareholders 
who joined the suit receive a check for their losses.
Shareholder class action suits are controversial; in one case, the law firm with 
the leading market share in the business turned out to be paying kickbacks to 
get shareholders to hire them. Many suits have been filed even though the com-
pany did nothing wrong, which leads to costly litigation that benefits lawyers 
but not shareholders. On the other hand, enough fraud and mismanagement has 
occurred over the years that these suits are often necessary.
Stanford University’s Law School maintains a comprehensive list of securi-
ties lawsuits at securities.stanford.edu. If you’re considering a suit to 
make yourself heard, you should start there to see what makes for a winning 
case, what defenses companies use, and which law firms handle these suits.
in recognizing early on the need and opportunity 
of a transition to a better and cheaper fuel.
While investment in renewable energy sources 
and ‘clean’ technologies has recently accel-
erated, driven by players as diverse as ven-
ture capitalists, chemical companies, Internet 
companies, and old-fashioned utilities, we 
believe our company is now lagging in creating 
solutions for the looming climate and energy 
crisis. We are concerned that ExxonMobil’s 
current slow course in exploring and promot-
ing low-carbon or carbon-free energy tech-
nologies will exacerbate the crisis rather than 
make ExxonMobil part of the solution.
We urge shareholders to vote for this proposal.”

ifferent social investors have different concerns. 
Some care about the environment, some are con-
cerned with corporate governance practices, and others

ment selections as the world changes.

▶ Investing responsibly where you — or others — live
▶ Promoting local business
▶ Financing the buildings that shelter a community
▶ Investing in the infrastructure that supports the people
▶ Considering charity, the company, and the community
S
ocial investing sometimes seems to be about solving enormous issues in 
faraway places. Investors worry about who’s financing what war, or how 
to ensure a safe habitat for polar bears a hundred years from now, or what 
God wants them to do. But what’s happening right down the street?
World-changing goals may be too lofty for some investors. For many investors, 
responsibility begins at home. They want to make investments that support 
their local community. Those investments may help new businesses grow, 
develop better housing, or support local philanthropies. Community institutions, 
workers, and businesses have strong ties, no matter what community they call 
home. If you’re one of those folks who wants to straighten things out in your 
neck of the woods before trying to change the rest of the world, then this is the 
chapter for you.
Whether you’re investing in New York City or a tiny Tanzanian village, you 
can get some ideas for making more socially responsible decisions from this 
chapter. It covers the benefits and pitfalls of local investing so you can take a 
savvy approach to civic support, no matter what assets are in your portfolio.

Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Beginning Social Responsibility at Home
A community is an interplay of organizations, starting with the federal, state, 
and local governments and including educational, religious, and nonprofit 
institutions. Within that framework are people and businesses that work 
together to make a better place to live.
Community investment covers a lot of different areas, ranging from building 
airports to helping a neighbor establish a home-based craft business. Although 
many community development efforts are funded by government agencies, 
many others are paid for by the private sector. As a socially responsible 
investor, you have plenty of ways to make money!
To start your investigation of opportunities, think about the community from 
two perspectives: the institutions in place and the businesses that operate 
within it.
Supporting community institutions
Although you can’t invest in a government agency or nonprofit organization 
directly, many investment opportunities are related to community institutions. 
For example:
 
✓ A municipal bond investor can help support schools and hospitals.
 
✓ A private airport or port operator can give a government a steady 
stream of income that it can use for other projects.
 
✓ A for-profit environmental consulting firm can offer a local government 
the expertise it needs to provide clean drinking water.
Flip to Chapter 12 to find out more about investing in the stocks and bonds 
that may accompany these opportunities.
Another way to invest in community institutions is to deposit money in a 
community development financial institution (or CDFI), which is a bank that 
participates in the U.S. government’s community development financing 
program. These banks are committed to offering community loans that 
support individuals and organizations that may have trouble getting funding 
from a traditional bank. You can find out more about these banks in Chapter 
14, and you can find a list of these institutions at the Coalition of Community 
Development Financial Institutions, www.cdfi.org.

 Chapter 6: Close to Home: Supporting Community Development
Investing in local development
Small businesses keep local communities vibrant. Local economic 
development agencies work to help new companies get established, and 
investors who are interested in community development often look for ways 
to help new companies grow. Local companies hire local workers and 
contribute to the local economy.
In fact, the U.S. Small Business Administration (www.sba.gov) reports that 
America’s 26.8 billion small businesses pay 45 percent of U.S. private sector 
payroll and create between 60 and 80 percent of new jobs. That’s impressive, 
especially because it’s all close to home.
So what development issues are important to a community, and how can you 
make money supporting them? Well, that will vary from place to place, but 
one source of ideas about current hot topics in development is the National 
Association of Development Organizations, www.nado.org. Its members 
come from development groups in cities and towns across the country to 
share ideas and research. Whether it’s brownfield redevelopment (which you 
can read more about in the later section “Developing commercial and office 
space”) or public transportation for rural communities, these folks are 
identifying problems and coming up with solutions.
Growing Local Businesses
One way to invest in your local community is to invest in its businesses. After 
all, businesses create jobs and bring money into a region. Good business 
opportunities also keep people from leaving for other places. It’s easy to invest 
in local businesses if your hometown is filled with large public companies; if 
that’s the case, just do your research (see Chapter 4 for some ideas about that) 
and then buy the stock.
If the companies are small and private, investing is a bit more challenging, 
but you still have investment opportunities. Chapter 16 covers the high-
finance aspects in detail, but in the sections that follow, I explain how local 
businesses look for capital within their own communities.
If you need leads on opportunities where you live, start by checking with your 
local economic development organization; you can find a list of organizations 
across the country at the National Association of Development Organizations’ 
Web site, www.nado.org (I talk more about this group in the preceding 
section). You can also call your local chamber of commerce to see what 
activities it has that you may be interested in supporting.

Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Most local small-business investment opportunities come through venture 
funds, incubators, and angel networks. Each of these serves investors and 
entrepreneurs in different ways. Whether you’re raising funds for your 
business or have money to invest, read on to find out the differences.
 
Entrepreneurs want to raise money from people they know because other 
financiers, such as banks and major national venture capital firms, want to 
know that the idea and the people behind it have credibility with those who 
know them best.
Joining local venture funds
Venture capital is money invested in a very new start-up business to help it get 
underway. Providing venture capital is risky because many new businesses fail. 
For this reason you should not invest in venture funds with money you cannot 
afford to lose. But the returns can be huge for those businesses that make it 
out of the venture stage and turn into full-fledged companies.
In some communities, venture investors get together and form a fund that 
has the express purpose of investing in local companies. They research 
proposals from new companies and then make investments when they see 
something they like.
These investors may be wealthy individuals (often successful entrepreneurs 
themselves), or they may be affiliated with local pension funds, foundations, 
or endowments (see Chapter 3 for more about these). Sometimes large local 
companies put money into venture funds in hopes of finding a business that 
will make a nice future acquisition.
 
Many locally focused venture funds belong to the Community Development 
Venture Capital Alliance, www.cdvca.org. You can check out that site for 
more information and for a list of member funds that may be looking for new 
investors — or new companies.
 
Not all local venture funds will match your social criteria, of course, so make 
sure to check out how the fund is designed to benefit the community and 
aligns with your objectives.
Affiliating with angel investors 
and angel groups
Angel investors are a special category of venture investor (see the preceding 
section). These folks are willing to put money directly into very small com-
panies that may not be able to attract funds from traditional sources. Angels 
are usually high-net-worth individuals who ran businesses themselves, and 

101
 Chapter 6: Close to Home: Supporting Community Development
most of them provide mentoring and advice to the companies they invest 
in. Interested investors usually find these opportunities through networking 
with local business and trade groups.
Angel investing is risky, and few investors are in a position to provide 
significant amounts of capital. And one individual making one investment 
may well become more of a meddler than a mentor.
To overcome these pitfalls and help even more entrepreneurs, angels in 
many communities have banded together to form angel groups. When angels 
join forces, they can spread their risk over several companies, and the 
company gets more contacts in the community. Angel groups also provide 
forums for entrepreneurs to meet with prospective investors and get ideas 
about how to run their businesses better.
The Small Business Administration reports that in 2006, the most recent 
year tracked, 649,000 new companies were formed and 564,900 firms folded. 
Two-thirds of businesses last at least two years, and 44 percent survive for 
four years or more. It’s far from certain that a company funded with angel 
money will turn a profit or survive, but those that make it often have a fine 
return on investment to compensate the angel for the risk.
 
Many angel groups are affiliated with the Angel Capital Association, 
angelcapitalassociation.org. The association’s Web site has more 
information about angel investing and a directory of its members, which may 
help you find opportunities where you live.
 
An angel network of investors is not the same as Oprah’s Angel Network (www.
oprahsangelnetwork.org), a charitable organization founded by Oprah 
Winfrey. Oprah’s Angel Network is committed to community volunteering and 
support, especially in parts of the world that are struggling economically. It 
doesn’t provide start-up capital to new companies.
Investigating opportunities 
through incubators
An incubator is an organization that helps small businesses get started. It’s 
usually a physical building where companies can set up offices, share such 
services and facilities as Internet lines and conference rooms, and come into 
contact with others starting small businesses.
Most incubators are affiliated with universities or community development 
organizations (or both). They rarely accept outside investors, but they’re 
often a source of opportunities for investors interested in funding small 
businesses within the community. Some incubators work with local venture 
funds, while others have opportunities for angel investors to meet incubator 
residents.

Incubation Association, www.nbia.org.
Building Buildings to Build Communities
Communities are set in places (and no, cyberspace doesn’t count as far as 
this chapter is concerned). The people in the community need places to live, 
places to work, places to learn, places to socialize, and places to shop. That’s 
why many community investment projects are tied to real estate, whether it’s 
residential, commercial, industrial, or institutional.
You can read more about the specifics of real estate investment opportuni-
ties in Chapter 15; the following sections give you information on the issues 
as they affect communities.
Owning the store through a co-op
A business needs customers to succeed. Some 
businesses are founded by groups of investors 
who then go out and find customers. Others are 
set up by the customers themselves, through 
a retail cooperative, also called a co-op. The 
customers join forces and run the business; if 
there’s sufficient profit at the end of the year, 
the member customers receive a dividend 
based on the amount of their purchases. There 
may be other benefits, like discounts during the 
year or advance notice of sales. Joining a co-op 
won’t make you rich, but it will save you money 
while supporting a local business and other 
local customers.
Retail cooperatives can be huge: REI (www.
rei.com), a major seller of outdoor clothing 
and equipment that generated $1.3 billion in 
revenue in 2007, is structured as a cooperative. 
For a $20 lifetime fee, REI members receive a 
dividend equal to 10 percent of their purchases, 
and they get to vote on the cooperative’s 
officers and key business issues.
Most co-ops are quite a bit smaller that REI. 
Many communities have co-op grocery stores 
that specialize in health food, organic produce, 
or foodstuffs from local farmers. Cooperative 
bookstores are often affiliated with universities 
and help ensure that students and faculty have 
access to textbooks and offbeat titles that may 
not be profitable for a traditional bookstore to 
carry. And some co-ops provide services for 
businesses, not consumers; many regions that 
rely on farming have co-ops to keep members 
stocked with seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural 
equipment.
If you’re interested in a community investment 
that will pay you back for buying things you 
would purchase anyway, you may want to inves-
tigate co-ops in your area. And if you’re really 
ambitious, starting a co-op can be another way 
to bring a new business to your community.

Putting down roots in residential housing
Everyone in a community needs a place to live, and ideally, it’s not in a car or 
under a bridge. But what types of housing make a community work? Should 
people be in single-family homes far away from where they work, or are they 
better off in apartments or condominiums close to where the action is?
Residential housing as a social investment can fall into several categories:
 
✓ Low-income housing is for people who otherwise can’t afford to live 
in the community. This type of housing may be in the form of deeply 
subsidized rents or assistance with down payments and financing for 
buyers.
 
✓ Workforce housing may be available for people who work for the 
community’s government, such as teachers, firefighters, or police 
officers, but who might not otherwise be able to afford to live there. 
This can be an issue in fancy suburbs and expensive cities.
 
✓ Senior citizen housing can be home to retirees. Some need financial 
assistance, some may need medical care, and some just want a smaller 
place than the one they lived in for years.
 
✓ Entry-level housing can attract recent college graduates to the community 
and encourage them to take jobs, start businesses, and put down roots.
 
✓ Emergency housing accommodates residents in the event of a disaster, 
such as a hurricane or a tornado.
The right kind of housing depends on the residents’ current needs as well as 
the community’s future ambitions. But whatever fits, there are opportunities 
for real estate developers and lenders to participate.
Developing commercial and office space
Although there are a lot of wonderful things about working from home, thriv-
ing communities need places where business can take place. Employers need 
offices, people need places to meet, and everyone needs stores where they 
can get the things they want and need in town.
Most commercial space is strictly that: commercial and for profit. And many 
of these developments are socially responsible. The projects that make the 
cut are in economically underserved communities and are environmentally 
sensitive. Here are a few examples of what to look for:

104
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
 
✓ Businesses that serve the underserved community: Many small towns 
and inner-city neighborhoods have more people than jobs. People have 
to leave the area to get to work, and they often have to go elsewhere to 
shop or have a night out. A commercial project that creates jobs; brings 
in vital support businesses, such as grocery stores and pharmacies; and 
gives people a safe and pleasant place to meet, like a coffee shop or café, 
can be a huge boost to the community’s financial health.
 
✓ Environmentally sensitive development: Although environmental 
issues are covered in depth in Chapter 8, they’re a big issue in commu-
nity development. A lot of commercial projects are ugly, and they waste 
resources, whether through inefficient lighting or enormous parking 
lots. A huge regional shopping mall built on a former cornfield miles 
away from where people live isn’t exactly the best thing for the environ-
ment. Many commercial projects offer better alternatives:
 
• They reuse space that may have stayed vacant otherwise.
 
• They’re built near where people already live and work.
 
• They use energy-efficient and sustainably produced materials.
 
• They’re designed to respect the community and its environment.
 
 Some real estate projects are set up under sustainability guidelines 
because the developers and managers are committed to improving the 
environment. Some projects are sustainable because they’re cheaper to 
operate. The result is more important than the reason.
 
✓ Brownfield redevelopment: A brownfield development project takes place 
on an old industrial site. When the former business was in operation, 
chances are that environmental regulations weren’t in place, so the site 
may be contaminated. Or there may be no contamination at all, but no 
one knows for sure.
 
 Any buildings on a brownfield site may be in disrepair or have problems, 
like wiring that’s no longer up to code. But if the sites aren’t redeveloped, 
they sit empty, attracting troublemakers and blighting the community. It’s 
a big challenge to redevelop such sites, but challenge creates opportunity. 
To turn them around, the government often has to clean up the site or 
take over the liabilities to make the site attractive to someone else. But 
when it’s done well, a brownfield redevelopment creates an attractive 
space for new businesses that can help rebuild the community.
Boosting communities through 
industrial development
Industrial jobs tend to be good, high-paying ones that require just a willing-
ness to work hard. That’s why many communities want to bring in big indus-
trial projects as part of an economic development program. It’s a way to 
create a lot of middle-class jobs, which creates a ripple effect:

105
 Chapter 6: Close to Home: Supporting Community Development
 
✓ The workers have more money to spend, which helps local stores.
 
✓ The factory needs services large and small, from vending machines 
in the break room to paving of the parking lot. These expenditures 
generate revenue for area service companies.
It seems like a big win. And in some cases it is. But when you’re looking to 
invest in an industrial project, you need to consider two key issues:
 
✓ Is the management interested in supporting the community, or will it 
pull out the moment it can find cheaper labor somewhere else?
 
✓ Is the project designed to minimize the environmental effects on the 
local community?
Hence, you have to do plenty of research, and Chapter 4 can give you some 
ideas of how to go about that.
 
Many communities get so excited about new factories that might hire lots 
of local workers that they give the companies enormous tax subsidies and 
breaks on regulations. In some cases, the community gives up more than it 
will ever get back. If a project requires a community to buy its jobs from a 
for-profit company, it’s not socially responsible for either the town or the 
business.
Interesting institutional projects
Communities also have institutions that support the people. Whether they 
are educational, health, or cultural, these institutions become places that 
the community will unite around. These may be for-profit, philanthropic, or 
government ventures, but no matter who’s providing the funding, you may 
want to find out more about the project.
You can probably find plenty of opportunities to participate! Some for-profit 
companies in search of investors are finding ways to provide institutional 
services better than cash-strapped local governments can. (It’s not without 
controversy; you can break up almost any party very quickly by asking your 
fellow guests whether for-profit companies can provide a better education 
than public schools.)
Governments often create public-private partnerships in order to get 
projects done on budget and on time. Even if the entire job is handled by the 
government, it may need to issue municipal bonds to raise the money, and 
lots of investors like those. (You can find out more about municipal bonds in 
Chapter 12.)

106
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
A purely philanthropic project may not have any investment opportunities, 
but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t care about the project. Many compa-
nies view philanthropy as an important way to support local communities. 
Corporations may support local institutions by contributing to the construc-
tion of a new hospital, underwriting a building at the local state university, or 
making a significant donation to the arts center. (The section “Focusing on 
corporate philanthropy” later in this chapter has more details on this topic.)
 
One person’s blight is another person’s job. Is a prison or a nuclear plant or a 
toxic waste dump a good or bad thing for a community? It all depends.
Contributing to Community 
Infrastructure
Everyone in a community needs a way to get from place to place. They need 
basic infrastructure to hold everything together, including transportation, 
utilities, and communications. This can be as simple as a paved path con-
necting an office building to a parking lot or as major as an international air-
port handling thousands of passengers each day.
Infrastructure has long been thought of as a public good — those goods and 
services that many people can use without limiting other people’s access and 
for which it’s difficult to exclude people who don’t pay. Most public goods 
don’t generate a profit but are necessary to keep a community functioning. 
(Suppose all roads were toll roads. How expensive would it be to get to work 
each day?)
Of course, public goods have a cost, and it’s borne by taxpayers. And 
because there are costs, investors have different investing opportunities. 
These may come from lending money to government organizations, providing 
services to the agencies in charge, or even buying an existing public infra-
structure project and turning it into a private company.
 
As financial markets become more sophisticated, new methods of financing 
projects can move more infrastructure from public to private ownership, pos-
sibly saving taxpayers money and bringing critical services into communities 
that need them.
Despite the taxes that people pay, many local governments are short of 
funds. The governments that have the least amount of money tend to have 
the greatest needs; if they aren’t taking in a lot of tax revenue, it’s probably 
because the communities are economically disadvantaged. That’s why many 
infrastructure projects need creative financing, often in partnership with pri-
vate companies.

107
 Chapter 6: Close to Home: Supporting Community Development
In the following sections, I outline some points to consider when thinking 
about infrastructure investing opportunities. I cover some of the specifics 
from an investor’s perspective in Chapter 12.
Minding money for municipal projects
Governments face the same problem that everyone in any kind of economic 
organization does: There are more good ideas for spending the money than 
money to be spent. But governments have an additional problem: They can’t 
just go out and find new revenue sources. A person can get a second job, a 
corporation can push a new product line, but a government is pretty much 
stuck. Sure, the administration can raise fees a bit, but it will take a lot of 
$1 increases on skate rentals at the local park district rink to pay for a new 
bridge.
There’s another wrinkle. When an individual saves money to spend on 
something, we view that as a good thing. When a government saves up 
money, we — the taxpayers — tend to view that as bad. Taxpayers would 
rather have extra money returned to them because they’re concerned that 
if government officials have extra money floating around, they’ll spend it 
foolishly.
For example, the town council may start saving to build a new bridge, but 
then a retired hockey player gets elected mayor and decides that it would be 
better to put a new state-of-the-art ice rink in every neighborhood. Then the 
money is gone, and even the taxpayers who like to skate end up annoyed.
That’s why most government projects start with no money down. They’re 
financed over the course of years through
 
✓ Direct borrowing (municipal bonds)
 
✓ Revenue bonds (in which the lenders receive a cut of fees generated 
from the finished project rather than interest payments)
 
✓ Lease with purchase arrangements
 
✓ Public-private partnerships
You can read more about these types of bond investments in Chapter 12.
Pondering privatization
After a government finishes an infrastructure project, it has something of 
value, like a big hospital, a toll road, or a port. But the grand new project may 

108
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
not generate any revenue for a community that needs money. Maybe a state 
built toll roads years ago when it had a lot of tax money coming in, but now 
it’s looking at enormous pension liabilities that are about to come due and 
voters who aren’t happy about paying more in taxes. Privatization may be 
one way to convert the asset into cash.
Privatization comes in two main forms:
 
✓ Operational privatization: If the operations are being privatized, the 
government maintains the responsibility for providing the service as 
well as retains the ownership of any underlying assets, but it contracts 
with a private company to manage the actual operations. For example, 
a city may keep ownership of its airport but hire an outside company to 
operate it. The company makes a bigger profit if it can generate more 
revenue and keep costs down, so it has an incentive to improve 
operations, making for a nicer airport at less cost to the city.
 
✓ Outright sale: With an outright sale, the government may decide that it 
doesn’t make sense to provide a certain service anymore, so it sells the 
asset. Maybe the town figures that it’s nice to have an ice rink, but 
it’s not nearly as important as having modern equipment for the fire 
department or a safe bridge over the river. It sells the rink to a sports 
management company that then takes over all responsibility for it, 
setting whatever fees it thinks the market can bear. The town takes the 
cash and invests it in other projects.
In many developing countries, the government owns many major businesses 
in whole or part because, at one time, there wasn’t enough capital in the 
country to support a private airline, bank, or telephone company. As the 
company modernizes and becomes more attractive to outside investors, it 
may no longer make sense for the government to own the business. These 
privatizations may involve distributions of some stock to employees and 
the sale of the rest to outside investors, with the proceeds going to the 
government.
Please note, though, that privatization is controversial:
 
✓ Maybe the asset being sold is more important than the use of the sales 
proceeds.
 
✓ Outsiders with a profit motive may not always do best by the 
community; they may tend to cut corners on service or security that a 
government official, accountable to voters, would not be willing to do.
 
✓ In at least a few cases, privatization contracts have gone to political 
cronies rather than to the highest bidder or best operator.

109
 Chapter 6: Close to Home: Supporting Community Development
As with all matters socially responsible, you have to do your research to 
ensure that an investment lives up to its billing.
 
A privatization program that takes over a community service so it no longer 
serves the community isn’t socially responsible. If a company privatizes the 
water utility in a poor community and can lower fees by operating more 
efficiently than the government agency, that’s good. If the company instead 
raises its rates so that half of the community can no longer afford running 
water, that’s bad. If you’re investing in a privatization project, find out what 
goes into the financial projections and the reputation of the company doing 
the privatization.
Considering Community Philanthropy
Maybe you’re interested in community development from a big-picture 
perspective. You aren’t necessarily interested in investing in any one 
community, but when you buy stocks and bonds, you want to support 
companies that support the communities where they do business. In the 
following sections, I give you information about a few things to look for. (For 
more about buying stocks and bonds, flip to Chapter 12.)
Checking out worker volunteer programs
Many companies provide additional benefits for employees who volunteer 
in their community. That may include time off, liability insurance, recogni-
tion, and financial contributions. Some companies have organized groups 
of employees who want to volunteer where they live; others may sponsor a 
day of volunteering in which all staffers work on a specific project, such as 
repainting a school or cleaning up a park.
Most companies that offer volunteer programs are proud to promote them 
on their Web sites and in public relations materials, so a quick Internet 
search can tell you what a company does or doesn’t do.
Many companies know that their community activities give them a positive 
image with customers and community members. And they know that employ-
ees want to live in a strong community and work for a company that values 
what they do outside of work, creating an important recruitment and reten-
tion advantage.

110
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Focusing on corporate philanthropy
Many companies put money back into the community through charitable 
donations. Some companies do this simply to be good citizens. Others are 
looking for specific public relations and marketing benefits, supporting those 
causes that resonate with their customers. And many companies delegate 
to their employees the decision of what causes to support through matching 
gift programs. By matching donations that employees make, companies help 
ensure that diverse community needs are met by various organizations. (A 
matching gift program is also a way to support employee activities, connect-
ing the workers to the company and the company to the community.)
Companies tend to be proud of their charitable activities and report them 
on their Web sites and in their annual reports. If you care about corporate 
philanthropy and don’t see the information, call the company’s investor rela-
tions staff and ask for details.
 
Just because a tax deduction is involved doesn’t mean that a contribution to a 
nonprofit agency is good for shareholders or for the community. Some compa-
nies have been known to make big donations to fancy charities to enhance the 
CEO’s social status. Others have supported dubious charities or charities that 
divide communities rather than unite them. In one notorious case, a brokerage 
firm made a large donation to a private school in the name of one of its ana-
lysts to help get the analyst’s children into that school; in exchange, the ana-
lyst issued a positive rating on a stock that he didn’t really like. That donation 
wasn’t philanthropy; the firm bribed the analyst by bribing the school. You 
should investigate corporate giving practices to ensure that they represent 
the wise use of corporate funds.
Examining social enterprises
A social enterprise is a small business that’s operated by a nonprofit organiza-
tion. Most have complex sets of goals that may include job training, creating 
markets for local resources, and raising money for the parent nonprofit.
In most cases, when you invest in a social enterprise, you’re really donating 
to the sponsoring organization, but that doesn’t mean that these groups can’t 
generate profitable opportunities. That’s why some businesses help fund and 
launch social enterprises in their communities. Other investors lend money 
to them, which gives the business the funding it needs to grow and gives the 
investor the potential for return without making an outright contribution.

111
 Chapter 6: Close to Home: Supporting Community Development
Social enterprises work in all kinds of industries, so there are a lot of oppor-
tunities for a creative company to support the mission while also contribut-
ing to profits. For example, a social enterprise may train specialized workers 
that a partner company needs. It may make unique goods that give local 
retailers an edge with customers. It may help local farmers find new ways to 
market their ingredients.
More information about social enterprises, including examples of some 
successful ones, is available from the Social Enterprise Alliance, www.se-
alliance.org.

Chapter 7
Scrutinizing Governance: How 
Is the Company Run?
In This Chapter
▶ Running a company for shareholders
▶ Working for the shareholders
▶ Tracking corporate behavior
L
ike many shareholders, you may believe that companies that are run well 
and have good oversight are more likely to behave ethically than those that 
are run poorly. When you pay attention to how companies are run, you’re using 
different measures of corporate governance. Investors interested in governance 
look at how well companies match current standards and how supportive 
management is of reforms. This chapter covers the basic concepts of corporate 
governance to help you understand how good companies should operate.
“What’s good for the country is good for General Motors, and vice versa,” 
said Charles Wilson, president of the automaker, during his confirmation 
hearings before serving as secretary of defense in the Eisenhower administra-
tion. And that’s exactly right. Companies that have good governance aren’t 
felled by massive scandals. The investors have the information they need to 
make good decisions, and the management is more concerned with creating 
a sustainable business than with protecting their fiefdoms.
Of course, General Motors has changed a lot in the last half century, so it’s 
not necessarily the model socially responsible corporation these days. But 
it’s still the industry giant, and its management is working through its prob-
lems and developing alternatives to its fuel-hungry SUVs.
 
Don’t confuse performance with governance. In most cases, a well-run company 
has great performance, but sometimes, a well-run company operates in a terrible 
industry. Likewise, when a company is doing well, investors and reporters some-
times like to claim the stellar performance is because of superior management 
ability and a sustainable strategy, when really, it’s just luck. Or fraud. It now 
seems like a sad joke, but Enron was once a darling among investors and the 
media because of its perceived innovations in the energy market.

114
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Taking Care of Shareholders 
and Other Constituents
Social investors are investors, first and foremost. No matter how many other 
concerns you have, you’re putting money into the market to get a return that 
will help you meet your long-term financial goals. That’s it. And that means 
your investment considerations should come first. Companies that operate 
responsibly may have strategic advantages that help them do better finan-
cially over the long haul, but not necessarily.
As part of their drive to maintain a sustainable organization, many busi-
nesses have expanded their operating charter to include constituent analysis 
or a stakeholder value. This means that management is allowed to consider 
other groups when making decisions, including employees, customers, and 
the community at large. Some states require corporations to place non-share-
holder constituents first, or at least address their concerns when making 
major decisions such as whether to proceed with mergers or acquisitions.
 
Corporations are governed by the laws of the state in which they’re incorpo-
rated. However, there is very little variation because almost all public compa-
nies and many private companies are incorporated in Delaware, which has an 
easy incorporation process and corporate-friendly laws.
Putting non-shareholder concerns first sounds like a nice idea that would 
fit with the needs of social investors, doesn’t it? Unfortunately, the constitu-
ent approach to corporate governance rarely works. In fact, it often gives 
management an excuse for ongoing underperformance. Managers can argue 
that it’s okay that they’re collecting big salaries and not generating profits, 
because their workers still have jobs. The problem is that if the company 
goes bankrupt, all of those workers will lose their jobs.
Running a company for shareholders doesn’t mean that the managers must 
be ruthless and cruel. It means managers must accept that, sometimes, short-
term pain for certain constituencies is necessary for the business to operate 
responsibly in the long run.
Good governance starts with transparency and consistency:
 
✓ Transparency means giving shareholders and employees information 
they need to make decisions, and part of that means making ethics 
guidelines clear.
 
✓ Consistency means that the rules always apply, whether it’s the CEO or 
an entry-level customer service representative.

115
 Chapter 7: Scrutinizing Governance: How Is the Company Run?
Making information available
A company never tells shareholders everything. It’s a competitive world 
out there. If shareholders demand specific information about contracts, 
strategies, and tactics, they could well end up destroying the company. 
Management needs to give shareholders enough information so they can 
make informed investment decisions. It’s not appropriate for them to give out 
more than that.
As an investor who cares about corporate governance, you need to check out 
three things:
 
✓ How much are the executives being paid relative to their performance? 
(Check out the later section “Executives and their compensation and 
perks” for more details.)
 
✓ Is the auditing firm doing its job? (The later section “The auditor’s 
role” has more information.)
 
✓ Is the board an unbiased overseer of management? (See the section 
“The board of directors’ responsibilities” later in this chapter.)
You can also turn to a company’s own documents, such as annual reports and 
marketing brochures, to get a feel for how it governs itself. But remember, 
these are internally produced publications, so a company is going to put its 
best foot forward.
Many companies have codes of conduct that are lavishly illustrated and 
printed in gorgeous, four-color brochures showing a veritable rainbow of 
employee skin tones. But if the code of conduct exists as art and nothing 
more, then it’s worthless. Guidelines are only as good as their enforcement. 
Are employees who violate rules fired, punished, retrained, or simply given 
a nudge and a wink? Or does it depend on who the employee is and what 
department he works in? Without fair and firm follow-up, the pretty pictures 
and strong words mean nothing.
Some of these matters are governance issues, while others are operational. 
Chapter 11 has information on how socially responsible corporations go 
about their daily business.
Annual reports also tend more toward artistry than information. The meaty 
material is buried in legal and accounting terminology and hidden in clever 
graphic design. Some companies satisfy the letter of the law, and others give 
shareholders detailed information that they can use to find out more about 
the business’s prospects. (Chapter 4 has a lot of information on how to read 
and understand annual reports.)

116
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Following good governance reforms
Some shareholders would be happy if company leaders simply adhered to 
current governance standards and didn’t go to great lengths to protect their 
jobs. Others would like to see more. They want the companies that they 
invest in to go beyond the minimum. Even better, they’d like to see the mini-
mum standards for governance raised.
Activists push for three reforms: majority voting, open nomination, and “say 
on pay.” A company can add any of these with shareholder approval, but 
few companies will make these changes unless they’re forced to by regula-
tory agencies or the stock exchanges. I explain these reforms in the following 
sections. A company that has instituted these reforms is rare, but if you see 
them in place, you might have a good investment on your hands.
Majority voting
Shareholders vote for members of boards of directors, but their votes count 
in different ways. At many companies, a plurality voting system is in place. A 
board member needs only to receive the majority of votes cast, not the votes 
of the majority of shares outstanding. Shareholders can’t vote against a direc-
tor; rather, they can vote for a director or withhold their vote (that is, not 
cast a vote at all). In a plurality system, only one vote is needed for a director 
to keep his seat. And because directors are shareholders, they can effectively 
vote to keep themselves on the board, even if every other shareholder wants 
to see them go.
Although it’s highly unlikely that any director anywhere will be able to stay 
on a board if he’s the only one who wants that, the mere fact that it’s pos-
sible annoys a lot of shareholders. It doesn’t seem right that one shareholder 
can override the wills of all the others. That’s why many shareholders want 
the vote for directors to move to a majority voting system.
Under majority voting, directors can keep their seats only if a majority of 
shareholders votes for them. If 1 million shares are outstanding, then a direc-
tor needs 500,001 votes to stay on, not just one.
Because a lot of people throw out their proxy statements rather than submit 
their votes, some majority voting systems allow directors to stay on if they 
receive a majority of votes cast, but with a twist: Shareholders are allowed to 
vote no rather than withhold their vote. Under this system, a director needs 
more yeses than noes to stay on board.
Open nomination
Companies allow shareholders to submit names for nomination to the board 
of directors, but these nominations are usually ignored. They aren’t publi-
cized. The nominating committee members make a note of the letter and then 
go about finding directors through their usual networks.

117
 Chapter 7: Scrutinizing Governance: How Is the Company Run?
Under open nomination, any names submitted by shareholders that meet 
minimum qualifications (no cartoon characters or dead celebrities allowed!) 
would have to be included on the proxy statement to be submitted to share-
holder vote. Then any directors who receive a majority of the votes would be 
named to the board. This could create competition among candidates; each 
candidate would have to explain to shareholders why he would be the best 
person to provide oversight for the company. It would also bring new people 
and new ideas to corporate oversight.
“Say on pay”
Shareholders vote on certain types of management compensation packages, 
especially those that include stock options or grants of shares of stock. 
Some forms of compensation, especially straight salary, are not voted on. 
After the shareholders approve a compensation package, they don’t get 
to make changes, even if the manager has proved to be undeserving of the 
money paid.
Hence, many shareholders are pushing for say on pay. Under this reform, the 
shareholders would get to vote annually on whether they believe the CEO’s 
pay is appropriate. It would be a nonbinding vote; the board wouldn’t be 
required to make changes if the shareholders no longer supported the CEO’s 
pay package. However, it would force the board to consider whether there 
are performance problems — or compensation problems — that should be 
addressed.
Ways to invest in governance
Every industry has companies with good gov-
ernance, and every industry has a few clunk-
ers. Investors who want to invest in companies 
that have good governance will have to do their 
research, just as will those who want to invest 
in companies with poor governance in hopes 
of profiting by turning things around. Investors 
interested in either type of governance issues 
will have no trouble finding suitable candidates, 
no matter where they look.
That being said, certain types of companies are 
in general more likely to have good governance 
than others. These are:
 ✓ Multinational consumer products com-
panies, which are concerned about their 
reputation in the market and are used to 
reporting information about their opera-
tions to governments all over the world
 ✓ Federal government contractors, which 
have to meet extensive reporting guide-
lines about their activities in exchange for 
receiving taxpayer dollars
Meanwhile, companies that are more likely to 
have problems tend to be entrepreneurial or 
have high levels of family ownership. These 
companies are often run by managers who view 
shareholders as meddlers, even if they are the 
legal owners of the companies.

“Shareholder rights” and the 
rights of shareholders
Corporate executives love their jobs. A CEO is about as much of an alpha dog 
as a person can be in our capitalist society. The pay is great, the office is the 
swankiest in the company, and no one reclines their seat in your face on the 
company’s Gulf Stream. Sure, there’s constant travel, long hours, and high 
pressure, but it beats waiting tables any day.
Because CEOs are so happy with their positions, they tend to resist when 
shareholders want them removed for poor performance. They want to thwart 
acquirers who may come in and kick them out. Hence, boards and managers 
often push for corporate bylaw provisions that make it hard for the company 
to be acquired without management’s consent.
The irony? These proposals are often called shareholder protection or share-
holder rights issues. Okay, that may not be quite as cynical as it seems: 
Investors have often been disappointed to find a company that they really 
like and that meets their objectives, only to have it merged into another 
company that doesn’t have the same social or financial prospects. It’s pos-
sible that these shareholders would want to keep their companies from being 
taken over. But the CEO and other managers usually have far more to lose. 
That’s because a company is most vulnerable to being taken over when the 
stock is cheap, and a cheap stock is usually associated with performance 
problems.
Shareholder rights programs are discussed in the company’s proxy state-
ment (also known in SEC terms as the DEF14A). Most such programs aren’t 
particularly friendly to shareholders, who would prefer that managers try to 
keep their jobs by performing well rather than by thwarting shareholders’ 
efforts to improve company performance by kicking them out.
Some shareholder rights programs are more obnoxious to the actual rights 
of shareholders than others. Most, but not all, have to be approved by share-
holders; all have to be approved by the board of directors. The following sec-
tions give an overview of some of the more common ones.
Director restrictions
Each year, companies announce candidates for the board of directors, and 
shareholders get to vote on them. At some companies, all the directors 
come up for vote every year. At others, they are staggered or classified: Each 
director holds a three-year term, but only a third of the directors stands for 
election in any given year. This helps directors gain experience, which is 
good, but that’s not the only purpose of this arrangement. Instead, it makes 
it nearly impossible for a hostile bidder to select a new slate of directors for 
shareholders to support, because only a few directors can be changed in any 
one year.

119
 Chapter 7: Scrutinizing Governance: How Is the Company Run?
A related provision says that after a director is on the board, he can only be 
removed for cause (such as skipping meetings or fraud) or by a supermajority 
vote (that is, by a larger percentage of votes than 50 percent plus one, some-
times set as high as 90 percent). This makes it difficult to bring new faces to 
the board, some of whom may be more interested in shareholder value than 
the current team.
Golden parachutes
Under a golden parachute, a senior company executive who loses his job after a 
hostile takeover receives a lush compensation package to help cushion the blow. 
The idea, of course, is to saddle the acquirer with such a high level of costs that 
a takeover no longer makes sense. Unfortunately, these have become typical in 
corporate compensation packages (which shareholders vote on).
A related compensation provision, the golden handcuff, is designed to com-
pensate the executive so well over a period of time that he has no incentive 
to leave. These often include stock options or bonuses that are paid out over 
several years and that go away if the employee quits.
Greenmail
Some CEOs and boards of directors are so anxious to make a big, bad 
activist shareholder go away, the one who would cut their perks and make 
them do better jobs, that they simply buy out the troublemaker. They offer 
to use company funds to pay the activist for his shares at a price above the 
current market price. In exchange, the activist agrees to go away for a certain 
period of time. This is called greenmail (think blackmail, only green for the 
color of money).
A handful of corporate raiders, wise to this tactic, started buying shares in 
companies for the sole purpose of negotiating greenmail agreements. This 
has become less common thanks to a U.S. tax code change that places a 50 
percent excise tax on greenmail profits. And that’s good, because it’s unclear 
how shareholders benefit when a company’s board of directors engages in 
these negotiations.
 
Many boards have been able to get shareholder rights plans passed by includ-
ing anti-greenmail provisions. Because greenmail is an egregious use of cor-
porate funds, the shareholders are often happy to go along with any plan that 
forbids it.
Poison pills
The classic shareholder rights plan is the so-called poison pill, which is a 
deal that the acquirer has to swallow unless, of course, the board approves 
the transaction. When someone acquires a predetermined percentage of 
the company’s shares, say 10 percent or so, the board of directors votes on 
whether to support the acquisition attempt. If the board supports the action, 
then business proceeds as usual. If not, then the pill comes out.

120
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
A typical poison pill arrangement gives all shareholders with smaller stakes 
than the dreaded acquirer warrants, which are rights to buy more stock at 
bargain prices. All of these small purchases drive up the stock’s price and 
make it more expensive for the person attempting the takeover; they also 
make the person’s stake in the company relatively smaller. The smaller 
stake then makes it more difficult to change directors or force through other 
changes when shareholders vote at the annual meeting.
Some bonds come with a similar provision, called a poison put. These give the 
bondholders the right to redeem their bonds at face value if a hostile takeover 
takes place. (That is, a takeover that is hostile from the perspective of the 
management or directors.) This increases the cost of the takeover, because 
the acquirer has to come up with the money to pay off the loans right now.
Supermajority voting
Shareholders have the right to vote for members of the board of directors 
and other business matters each year. On almost all issues, the majority 
rules. In order to win, a board candidate, shareholder proposal, or other 
issue needs 50 percent plus one of the votes cast.
To deter takeovers, though, some companies have established a higher 
threshold for certain business matters, such as mergers or acquisitions that 
the board doesn’t support. For these, a supermajority, say 80 to 90 percent, 
of shareholders must vote in favor of the transaction. This makes it hard for 
such a deal to go through because when do 80 or 90 percent of people agree 
on anything? (Yes, members of legislative bodies voting themselves a pay 
raise is the exception!)
Who Is Working for Shareholders?
The skills involved in making investment decisions and running companies 
are very different. Legally, shareholders own the company and elect a board 
of directors to represent their interests. The board of directors, in turn, hires 
the senior managers and oversees their activities. At least, that’s the way it’s 
supposed to work. It doesn’t always.
Management and shareholders often want different things. They have an 
inherent conflict known as the principal-agent problem, where the sharehold-
ers are the principals and the managers are the agents. If the principals don’t 
pay attention, their agents will work for themselves. And that’s not good 
governance.

121
 Chapter 7: Scrutinizing Governance: How Is the Company Run?
In an ideal world, managers are paid for delivering results for shareholders, 
the auditors verify those results, and the board of directors holds the manag-
ers accountable for their actions. This section covers these key governance 
functions in more depth.
Executives and their compensation 
and perks
Chief executive officers have big jobs. They have huge responsibilities for 
setting strategy, promoting the company, and overseeing the work of 
hundreds or thousands of employees who may be located all over the world. 
Most CEOs work more or less from sunrise to bedtime; even their social lives 
may be dominated by client entertainment, dinners with vendors, and golf 
outings with bankers. Because of the volume and importance of their work, 
they should be paid a lot of money — and not a penny more.
 
Shareholders will accept a well-paid CEO as long as the investment returns 
follow.
Executives also receive perquisites, often called perks. These are special 
privileges that go with the job. They range from never having to justify a 
dinner check to the accounts payable department to plush apartments 
in world financial capitals, personal use of corporate aircraft, and skybox 
season tickets for all the local sports teams. Some of these extras may be 
justifiable; for security and efficiency reasons, it may be a good idea for the 
CEO to have a car and driver so he can place calls during his daily commute. 
But most perks are fluffy fringe benefits that come straight out of shareholders’ 
profits.
CEOs may deserve big pay, but only if they’re doing the big job that they were 
hired to do. After all, the CEO’s compensation is an operating expense to the 
firm, so it cuts into the return that shareholders receive. If the CEO’s salary 
is too high, it may cause resentment among the firm’s other employees. And 
sometimes CEOs make decisions that are more about preserving their own 
power (read: pay and perks) than increasing shareholder value. A content CEO 
may not take appropriate risks. He may be so busy enjoying his benefits that 
he lets the business stagnate. At an extreme, he may condone fraud if it gets 
him the bonus he wants and lets him keep his position.
 
Every April and May, after annual reports and proxy statements are released, 
business reporters rank chief executive officers of public companies by invest-
ment performance and pay. The highest rankings go to those executives who 
deliver relatively high rates of return per zero on the paycheck. If you missed 
the most recent analysis, try doing an Internet search on “CEO pay perfor-
mance” to find the results.

Part II: Issues to Invest In 
The auditor’s role
People like to think that accountants are boring people who live by the rules 
and don’t ever dare flex them even a teensy bit, let alone break them. The 
reality is that generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and IRS tax 
regulations give companies a lot of leeway in calculating their earnings and 
presenting their financial position. They may not allow as much wiggle room 
as some executives at some companies would like, of course, but accoun-
tants have enough legal options that a company’s financial performance may 
look a little better than it actually is.
Public companies are required to have outside accountants come in each 
year to audit the financial results and certify that they comply with appli-
cable accounting regulations and present a fair picture of the company’s 
performance.
Because shareholders care about the accuracy of the financial results and 
vote to approve the accounting firm, you may think that the different audi-
tors would compete on how tough they are. “Nine of out ten shareholders 
surveyed recommend our audits!” they could say, or “We caught more fraud 
last year than all of our competitors combined!” If only that were the case.
The reality is that there are only a handful of accounting firms, so they aren’t 
exactly ruthless competitors. Almost all public companies use one of four big 
brand-name auditors: Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, Ernst & Young, KPMG, or 
PricewaterhouseCoopers. Few other firms have the resources or the capa-
bilities of examining the books at large companies operating from multiple 
locations. (Private companies, small public companies, real estate firms, and 
other investment opportunities that you come across probably use other 
auditors. Most of the other auditing firms are perfectly fine; they just don’t 
have nearly the market share of the Big Four.)
 
Accounting firms don’t prepare a company’s financial reports. The company’s 
employees do. The auditing firm’s job is to test and verify that the employees’ 
work is accurate. Because investors need good numbers to make decisions, 
internal financial controls and external auditor reviews are key corporate 
governance issues.
 
Just because a company uses a well-known accounting firm doesn’t mean the 
audit is any good. Auditors can miss a well-constructed fraud built by senior 
executives. On occasion, the accountant assigned to conduct the audit will be 
a party to the fraud.
You may not be able to catch fraud on your own, but you don’t have to be 
an accountant to determine if the auditing firm is doing a good job and if the 

123
 Chapter 7: Scrutinizing Governance: How Is the Company Run?
company’s books are in good shape. One clue is if the company has material 
weaknesses in its financial reports, which are announced in the auditor’s 
letter. If these weaknesses exist, it’s possible that they were a problem a 
while ago and the auditor missed them or let them slide in the hope that 
management would fix them fast. Or it’s possible that the problem is new, but 
it’s the proverbial tip of the iceberg; fresh eyes on fresh-faced accountants 
from another accounting firm may be able to find other problems.
The board of directors’ responsibilities
Members of boards of directors must be shareholders in a company, although 
some directors don’t become shareholders until they’re nominated. Many 
directors are small shareholders, too, owning just 100 shares, which is the 
minimum size order that can be traded without paying an extra commission.
Directors fall into two categories:
 
✓ Affiliated directors are company employees, recent retirees, or others 
with close financial ties to the business.
 
✓ Independent directors have no material relationship with a company. 
They are neither employees nor former employees, nor do they work for 
customers or vendors. They shouldn’t be relatives of any of the managers 
or others with significant relationships with the company, either. They 
have no financial stake in the business’s prospects other than as owners 
of publicly traded stock.
Interlocking directorships
Even though a director is classified as independent, she may still have 
important conflicts of interest. The best known is the problem of interlocking 
directorships.
Say there are two people, Susie and Janie. Janie is the CEO of a company 
where Susie is on the board, and Susie is the CEO of a company that has Janie 
on the board. How much oversight will Janie place over Susie, knowing that 
Susie will be overseeing Janie? Probably not much! In fact, they may try hard 
to keep their dealings friendly, no matter what’s in the best interests of either 
firm’s shareholders.
 
Directors with interlocking relationships to management are generally not 
considered to be independent, but these relationships are harder to track 
than more straightforward situations such as a current or former employee.

124
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Responsibility overload and conflict of interest
Some directors become overloaded with too many board responsibilities. 
Being on a board takes time; it’s not a full-time job, but it can take up as 
much as a day out of every week, depending on the size of the company and 
the issues that it faces. A director who serves on too many boards can’t be 
expected to keep track of everything at every company.
Also, the more boards a person serves on, the greater the potential for 
hidden interlocking relationships that may create conflicts of interest. Most 
investors are all right with a board member who sits on five different boards, 
using the one-day-a-week guideline and assuming that the director doesn’t 
have other commitments, such as a full-time job.
After someone joins a board, he should go to the meetings. Otherwise, how 
else will the board member know what’s happening with the company in 
order to give management guidance and provide oversight for the sharehold-
ers? Proxy statements show meeting attendance; a board member should be 
at 75 percent of those unless he has a valid excuse.
 
A death in the family is a valid excuse; a ski trip that seemed like it would be 
more fun than sitting in a stuffy meeting talking about banking arrangements 
is not.
Keeping an Eye on Things: 
Guidance Standards
Our economy relies on businesses to create jobs, pay taxes, and keep 
the wheels of commerce humming. Hence, lots of people — not just share-
holders — have a stake in ensuring that companies have good governance 
practices.
Some recommendations have come from general observations about which 
practices work and which are more likely to lead to trouble. Many others 
have been codified by stock exchanges and government regulations. When 
a requirement is set by a leading organization, people pay attention, even if 
their business isn’t directly affected.
For example, when the New York Stock Exchange publishes changes to its 
corporate governance guidelines for companies that trade there, companies 
with shares that trade elsewhere have to explain to shareholders why they 
don’t meet the standard. Most change their standards to keep pace.

125
 Chapter 7: Scrutinizing Governance: How Is the Company Run?
NYSE and Nasdaq listing standards
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was long the most prestigious trad-
ing floor in the world. The NYSE has less luster than it once had because of 
major changes in the way that stocks are traded, especially the movement 
toward electronic trading. Along the way, it lost much market share to the 
Nasdaq, an electronic exchange formerly known as the National Association 
of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System.
Both exchanges have high standards for companies listed on them, whether 
the security trades on the floor at the corner of Broad and Wall streets or 
over an electronic network. The standards are also good models for private 
companies and others that aren’t traded on the exchanges.
The two exchanges have some minor differences in their standards, but both 
agree that listed companies should have
 
✓ A majority of the members of the board of directors with independent 
status.
 
✓ Regularly scheduled executive sessions, which are meetings attended by 
only those directors who aren’t company employees, and no manage-
ment members are present.
 
✓ A nominating committee made up of independent directors to find 
people who are qualified to become board members.
 
✓ A compensation committee made up of independent directors to evalu-
ate the performance of the company’s chief executive officer and draw 
up compensation plans for corporate executives.
 
✓ An audit committee made up of three independent directors who have 
demonstrated financial literacy, including at least one member who has 
experience in accounting or financial management.
 
✓ Corporate governance guidelines that the board has adopted and pub-
lished for interested shareholders to read.
 
✓ A code of business conduct for directors, officers, and employees, 
with disclosure of any waivers that have been granted. (For example, if 
employees working in one country are allowed to give and receive gifts 
because it reflects the local culture, while employees in other countries 
may not do so, that exception should be disclosed.)

President’s Working Group 
on Capital Markets
After the stock market crashed in 1987, President Ronald Reagan signed an 
executive order creating the President’s Working Group on Capital Markets. 
The group advises the president on domestic and international financial 
crises and recommends new regulations that can help prevent the situation 
from happening again. It has often been called in on governance issues, espe-
cially in the wake of a series of corporate scandals in the early 2000s.
The group consists of
 
✓ the secretary of the Treasury
 
✓ the chairman of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System
 
✓ the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
 
✓ the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
Any of these people can appoint someone to take his place, so many people 
from outside of government have been a part of this group over the years.
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
Few laws struck fear into the hearts of corporate executives more than the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, sometimes known as SOX. The U.S. Congress 
passed the law after some horrendous corporate scandals, including the 
punch line for all corporate scandals ever, Enron.
Sarbanes-Oxley brings criminal penalties to corporate governance. Before 
Sarbanes-Oxley, executives could go to prison if they were accused of 
outright fraud, but they had an excuse if fraud happened elsewhere in the 
firm, even major fraud. The CEO could always say, “Well, gosh, how was I 
supposed to know what those bad, bad people over in the retail division 
were doing?” Well, the CEO is supposed to know because he runs the show. 
Sarbanes-Oxley returns responsibility to the top dog.
Now surely a sneaky employee can pull one past the chief executive officer. 
To minimize the risk, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act calls for companies to have 
detailed financial controls in place that can be tested. That part of the law, 
Section 404, created a lot of work for a lot of companies. To comply, a busi-
ness must do such things as have a standard for setting passwords, create a 
policy for canceling passwords when an employee leaves the firm or changes 
duties, document how often the passwords were changed according to the 
policy, and enumerate all cases where exceptions were made and explain 
why. And that’s just for passwords!

127
 Chapter 7: Scrutinizing Governance: How Is the Company Run?
Section 404 applies to every process in the firm that affects the reported 
financial results. If a firm can show that it has effective financial controls, 
then the CEO can avoid criminal responsibility for fraud committed by other 
employees. For more information, check out Sarbanes-Oxley For Dummies, 
2nd Edition, by Jill Gilbert Welytok (Wiley).
Securities and Exchange Commission
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the government agency 
that oversees the stock and bond markets. It approves the corporate gov-
ernance standards set by Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. It also 
enforces violations.
Failure to meet legal and exchange-created governance standards can result 
in fines, civil penalties, and the sort of extreme bad publicity that makes 
many investors run for the doors (bumping into the activist investors who 
are rushing in to pressure the company to change).
Corporate raids as investment strategies
The easy thing for a socially responsible inves-
tor to do would be to avoid companies with bad 
governance because so many companies with 
good governance are out there. Many inves-
tors follow what they call the Wall Street Rule: 
If they don’t like what a company is doing, they 
simply sell their shares. They see no need to 
get involved with any of the hassles of voting 
proxies or calculating ratios of executive pay to 
corporate profitability.
But other investors, known as activist investors, 
want to press companies for change. Some of 
these folks are purer of heart than others. Some 
find themselves with stock that they have to 
own, maybe as part of an index strategy (one 
that owns shares in every company in a major 
stock index, such as the S&P 500) or because 
of a bequest. These shareholders may push for 
change to improve the returns on their current 
investments
Others who lead activist charges often see poor 
governance as a profit opportunity rather than 
as a way to change the world. These people, 
often known as corporate raiders or takeover 
artists, find companies that are undervalued 
because of mismanagement, take a control-
ling interest in the company, and then make 
trouble.
Corporate raiders tend to care about good 
governance only because it helps them make 
money. They aren’t interested in building sus-
tainable businesses or improving returns for 
long-term investors. And they most definitely 
don’t want to be stuck running the company! 
Raiders want to get in, get their profit, and get 
out. In the past, some launched their attacks 
on companies in hopes of receiving green-
mail, which are payments designed to get an 
unwanted investor to go away.

128
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
And yet, corporate raiders aren’t all bad. They 
play an important role in keeping stock mar-
kets efficient. To maximize their profits, they 
identify companies with the worst practices. 
Experienced lawyers and public relations 
experts help them press their cases. And, 
because raiders have been effective in the 
past, they strike fear in the hearts of CEOs and 
board members. Sometimes a mere rumor that 
a well-known corporate raider is interested in a 
business will force the board and executives to 
change their ways.
Corporate raiders tend to use the same 
tactics as any other investors looking for 
change: submitting shareholder resolutions, 
nominating members to the board of directors, 
and recruiting other shareholders to vote with 
them at annual meetings. You can find out more 
about these tactics in Chapter 5.

ompanies produce goods and services every day, and in almost all cases, 
they use natural resources for free. At least, there’s no cost upfront. Many 
investors — and maybe you’re one of them — have real concerns about how a 
company’s operations affect the environment, from the raw materials that go 
into a product to the way that it’s disposed of when it reaches the end of its 
life. And for good reason. If someone owned the air or the water, that owner 
would demand compensation for the environmental damage. But because no 
one owns the environment, everyone suffers from its damage.
No one gets away with harming the air, land, or water forever. If a company 
isn’t using resources wisely, it faces a few very real risks. At some point, 
government regulators get around to placing restrictions on air, water, and 
soil pollution. It’s not always cheap to comply with the regulations, but it’s 
almost always more expensive to repair past damage. Doing the right thing 
can save a bundle in the long run. If a company’s product relies on a scarce 
resource for its manufacture or operation, that resource must be used 
thoughtfully or it may go away, taking the market for the product down with 
it. Finally, customers care about the effects of the goods and services that 
they use every day. A company that takes care of the environment may have 
an advantage in attracting customers.
All of these factors add up to good things for investors who care about the 
environment, and that’s what this chapter is all about. First I give you the 
basics on sustainability and environmental issues as they relate to business. 
Then I give you the lowdown on how to put all of that information to use in 
your investments.

Factoring In Sustainability
I mention sustainability a few times throughout this chapter, so before my 
editor sends me a note about supplying the definition you need, here it is: 
Sustainability means providing for the needs of the present without compro-
mising the resources available for future generations. And it’s a hot buzzword 
in the investment world right now.
By that definition, any process anywhere that uses nonrenewable resources 
is not sustainable. Prime example: our oil-based economy. Yes, oil is slowly 
being created naturally by the chemical transformation of marine organisms 
under high pressure and temperature, but the amount of oil we’re using 
nowadays far outpaces nature’s renewal rate. The same is true for pumping 
groundwater from aquifers, mining metals, and burning down rain forests for 
cattle pastures.
However, the sustainability philosophy recognizes that businesses should 
meet present needs. It’s not calling for sacrifice, just change. And change cre-
ates opportunities for businesses and investors who can navigate through it.
As a practical matter, sustainability is shorthand for environmental perfor-
mance, and it includes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy and resource 
efficiency, water use and wastewater generation, recycling, pollution preven-
tion, regulatory compliance, and just about any other green concept you 
can imagine. Is composting part of sustainability? Sure. Compact fluorescent 
bulbs? You bet. Installing bike racks in front of apartment buildings or office 
complexes? Why not? I cover most of these topics throughout this chapter, 
but for now, my goal is to help you fully grasp sustainability so you can 
better understand environmental business issues.
 
Operations executives like to talk about the supply chain, which is every step 
involved in getting a product to market. It includes extracting the raw mate-
rials from the ground, getting them to the factory, and getting the finished 
goods to customers. For many companies, the supply chain is a complex 
series of steps, but efforts to make any part of it more efficient and sustainable 
pay off when multiplied across all the products the company will make for 
years to come.
Designing products for sustainability
Sustainability starts with a design that considers what materials will go into the 
product, how it will be manufactured, how it will be shipped to customers, how 
it will be used, and then how it will be reused, recycled, or trashed when it’s no 
longer useful. At every step, the product’s developer needs to think about how 
to serve present needs without affecting the future environment. That’s a tall 
order, especially for a product that’s been on the market for generations.

131
 Chapter 8: Evaluating Environmental Investing
 
Everything can be designed to be sustainable, from the toothpaste you use 
first thing in the morning to the skyscraper where you work during the day. 
But it’s not easy to design everything to be sustainable, and some industries 
find it darn near impossible. As with everything in life, working toward the 
goal certainly gets you further than you are now, even if you don’t reach it, so 
many designers and engineers are working on designing sustainable products 
because true sustainability starts at the drawing board.
One of the key specifications for sustainability during the design stage is the 
identification of the product inputs. This means finding renewable sources for 
as many of the materials as possible, with an eye toward how to manage the 
product at the end of its life. Here are a couple of examples:
 
✓ For a clothing manufacturer, sustainable design may mean finding cotton 
grown with less water, colored with dyes that don’t require rinsing, made 
with plastic notions (buttons, zippers, and the like) designed to biode-
grade at the same rate as the cotton, and shipped to retailers on reused 
and reusable hangers in reused and reusable plastic cartons.
 
✓ For a beverage company, it may mean finding organic sources for 
sweeteners and flavorings; locating bottling facilities in places with 
excess local water; and designing bottles and cans that are lightweight 
to reduce energy used in shipping and are reusable and recyclable to get 
more use out of a single package.
Rethinking the manufacturing process
The stereotype of factories is that they are dark, grimy, and dusty, spewing 
heaven only knows what kinds of horrible chemicals into the air and water. 
Some are exactly like that, too, but the situation is changing. Some compa-
nies are driven by regulation, but others just want to do the right thing now 
so they can keep their business running for the long haul.
Processes that are designed to be sustainable are engineered to be as closed-
loop as possible. The inputs are matched with the finished product, so there 
is very little wasted energy, unused raw material, or pollution generated by 
the time the product hits the shelves (see “Taking a Closer Look at Pollution” 
later in this chapter). This can involve a complete overhaul of the facility or 
small changes in the steps along the way.
In most cases, the most difficult step in manufacturing sustainably is managing 
the pollution. Almost any process creates some waste that has to go some-
where, whether it’s solid waste for a landfill, particulates that go into the air, 
or effluent that ends up in the water. The payoff in managing pollution is huge, 
though, in terms of reduced worker exposure to harmful chemicals, better 
relations with the surrounding community, and a business that can grow with 
minimal balance sheet liabilities (see the later section “Accounting for long-
term liabilities” for more on this) and maximum resources at its disposal.

Sustainable manufacturing is easier in some industries than in others. As an 
investor, you may want to consider companies that have made tremendous 
progress or that have sustainable practices relative to their industries 
instead of just going for businesses that find it easy to be sustainable. An 
accounting firm will have an easier time being sustainable than a chemical 
company; that’s the nature of the different businesses. As long as people 
need chemicals, though, it’s important that these companies make progress 
on being sustainable. Some investors believe that these initiatives create 
exciting long-term profit opportunities.
 
Cogeneration is a great sustainable technique for many manufacturing firms. 
This process creates big savings by generating electricity as a side effect of 
the production process. If the manufacturing process generates a lot of heat, 
some of it can be redirected to keep the building comfortably warm. If the heat 
is especially intense, as in steel making, it can be used to generate steam for 
turbines that can provide some of the facility’s electricity.
Distribution and consumption
After the goods are made, they have to get into customers’ hands somehow, 
and that, too, uses resources. Sure, a company could have its customers 
drive to the factory and haul the items away, but that doesn’t make the pro-
cess more sustainable. It simply shifts the responsibility, and that’s not good. 
The whole point of sustainability is to make permanent changes now to pro-
tect future resources.
Although no business can force its customers to take public transit to the 
store, a company can do quite a few things to make product distribution and 
consumption more sustainable. Take liquid laundry detergent. It used to be 
sold in big jugs that were heavy to lug around. By reducing the amount of 
water in the formula, the detergent company can put the same amount of 
active ingredient in a smaller bottle. The customer uses less product to get 
the same amount of cleaning. The smaller bottles weigh less, so less energy 
is used to get them to the store. The smaller bottle is made from less material 
and leaves less to be recycled. The product isn’t perfectly sustainable, but 
it’s an example of how the detergent maker is getting closer to the goal.
Most efforts to make the distribution and consumption processes more sus-
tainable lead to lower costs for the company, which means greater profits for 
shareholders. And that’s the goal!

 Chapter 8: Evaluating Environmental Investing
Waste not, want not: Waste disposal, 
the sustainable way
After the customer uses the product, what happens? Is it all used up? Or is 
there a package, a byproduct, or an obsolete item sitting around somewhere? 
If something has to be done at the end of the product’s life, a sustainability 
issue has to be managed.
 
For all the progress that’s been made in product design and alternative uses, 
disposal is still the biggest sustainability challenge. Too often, using a product 
now means having it sit in a landfill for centuries to come. When you’re look-
ing at companies to invest in, seek out ones that are finding ways to solve the 
problem. But sustainable waste disposal is harder to tackle than other steps 
along the supply chain.
If the product’s designers did a good job, they considered the product’s dis-
posal in the design specifications. A truly sustainable product is made with 
materials that can be reused or recycled to avoid the fate of landfilling or 
deep-sea dumping. For materials that are difficult to recycle, such as plastics, 
the solution is often to burn the material in power plants (a process known 
as waste to energy; plastic, after all, is mostly petroleum.)
 
In Europe (and at some companies with some products in the United States), 
the ruling philosophy is extended producer responsibility. That means that the 
manufacturer, not the consumer, is responsible for ensuring that the product 
is disposed of safely and without creating environmental damage. This ranges 
from changes in shampoo bottles to ensure that they’re recyclable to operat-
ing store-based collection programs for old televisions and computer equip-
ment. As extended producer responsibility becomes the norm in more places 
for more products, companies will be forced to build in sustainability from the 
start. The bad news for investors is that doing so increases the cost of doing 
business.
Industries for the environmental investor
If your interest is in protecting the environment, 
you may want to start by looking at companies 
in these industries. Not all companies in these 
industries will be good ones — and every indus-
try seems to have one or two companies that 
are standouts in sustainability — but at least 
this list gives you a starting point.
 ✓ Alternative energy
 ✓ Environmental consulting and engineering
 ✓ Food processing
 ✓ Ocean shipping
 ✓ Railroads
 ✓ Technology
 ✓ Water utilities

Taking a Closer Look at Pollution
Pollution is produced at every link of the supply chain, creating potential liabili-
ties and a challenge for businesses that want to be sustainable. Whether a prod-
uct is animal, vegetable, or mineral, its production emits greenhouse gasses into 
the air, generates chemicals that leech into the ground, or spills byproducts into 
fresh water. Whenever someone turns one thing into another or extracts some-
thing from the ground, waste is created that affects something else.
For most companies, the cheapest option in the absence of regulation is to 
do nothing and let someone else deal with the pollution problem. Sooner 
or later, though, the good citizens of the world complain about air that is 
unhealthy to breathe or water that isn’t safe to drink, and they ask their gov-
ernments to do something. The governments respond with regulations and 
fines, costing businesses involved a lot of money.
 
The average person tends to freak out about toxic substances, especially car-
cinogens (cancer-causing substances). The problem is that many items that 
are perfectly fine or even healthy in small amounts become deadly in huge 
quantities. (Salt is deadly, for example, and yet we all love it and need it and 
have a lethal dose of it in our kitchens. It’s the difference between consuming 
a quarter teaspoon and a pound in one sitting.) In many cases, a company may 
release chemicals in trace amounts so low that regulators and toxicologists 
have no concern, yet the public overreacts. The risk for investors is that a busi-
ness with a fine environmental record can get dragged into a public relations 
quagmire or feel forced to spend excess money to keep constituents happy.
Costs aside, pollution is destructive to the environment that we all share, so a 
social investor isn’t going to want to invest in businesses that willfully pollute. 
(No less a personage than Pope Benedict XVI has claimed that pollution is a sin.) 
Most pollution problems can be reduced or prevented, although not for free. An 
investor who cares about the environment would want proof that a company is 
working to manage its pollution before buying bonds or shares of stock. And this 
often means paying attention to news coverage rather than company announce-
ments. For more information on doing research, see Chapter 4.
Controlling carbon and other 
airborne elements
Air pollution comes in two forms, particulates and gasses:
 
✓ Particulates include dust, ash, and other fine bits that are spewed out of 
smokestacks and exhaust pipes. Many, although not all, of these can be 
scrubbed or filtered out before they hit the air.

135
 Chapter 8: Evaluating Environmental Investing
 
✓ Gasses are chemical substances in their gaseous form (as opposed 
to liquid or solid), and they often can’t be screened out. These range 
from perfectly fine to outright deadly gasses, and they can enter the air 
through smoke and exhaust or from the evaporation of a liquid.
The hot issue in air pollution these days is carbon, especially in its greenhouse 
gas form of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is generated whenever liquid or 
solid carbon is burned — as in coal or gasoline. Greenhouse gasses hold in the 
sun’s heat, changing the earth’s climate. The possible effects range from posi-
tive (Arable land in the Yukon! Tolerable winters in Chicago!) to devastating 
(extinction of species, drought and famine, skin cancer epidemics). Of course, 
because you’re reading this book, you’re probably more interested in prevent-
ing climate change than in getting me through another Midwest winter.
 
Carbon isn’t the only substance that ends up in the air and can cause prob-
lems for the planet’s long-term health. Other gasses implicated in climate 
change include methane, hydrofluorocarbons, nitrous oxide, and sulfur hexo-
fluoride. When looking at companies that have manufacturing processes that 
emit chemicals into the air, be sure to ask about all the gasses and particu-
lates involved.
Greenhouse gas reduction
Viewed through the lens of global climate change, reducing greenhouse 
gasses is a hidden benefit of increasing energy efficiency. Companies can 
reduce energy use for the simple financial reasons that grow more apparent 
each time we fill up our gas tank, yet get credit for saving the planet by taking 
on global warming.
Beyond simple energy efficiency, many companies are addressing the prob-
lem through improvements in design, manufacture, and distribution designed 
to limit the use of electricity, plastics, and gasoline. Some are experimenting 
with carbon sequestration, in which carbon that would have been spewed into 
the air is collected and injected back into the ground from which it originally 
came. Others are thinking in more radical ways, working to reduce the reli-
ance on internal combustion altogether. (You can read more about alterna-
tive energy later in this chapter.)
The fastest way to reduce greenhouse gasses would be to shut down our econ-
omy. Fast, yes, but hardly practical. People all over the world, some of whom 
lived in dire poverty until very recently, want energy and they want goods.
Examining the Carbon Principles
To meet the demand for energy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions, 
three of the world’s largest investment banks developed Carbon Principles to 
guide their investments in electric power projects. Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and 
Morgan Stanley announced the principles in February 2008, and they may be 
useful to investors looking to identify companies that make a difference on 
this matter. The Carbon Principles are

136
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
 
✓ Energy efficiency, which reduces carbon emissions by not emitting 
them in the first place. Investors should look for projects that include 
efficiency from the start.
 
✓ Renewable and low-carbon energy technologies, which are often good 
substitutes for traditional coal-based power generation. Many of these 
technologies create new businesses and new jobs, so this is a key area 
for start-up financing.
 
✓ Risk assessment on projects that rely on traditional energy technologies. 
Future regulations may create liabilities, and investors should consider 
those at the time of investment.
You can see the full list of policies at www.citigroup.com/citigroup/
press/2008/080204a.htm.
Carbon as an asset class
Many nations around the world, but not the 
United States, have signed the Kyoto Protocol, a 
treaty under which the signing nations commit-
ted to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and 
five other greenhouse gasses by 5.2 percent 
below their 1990 emissions levels by 2012. The 
Kyoto Protocol calls for a cap-and-trade system 
for managing greenhouse gas volumes. Under 
it, companies that emit greenhouse gasses are 
given a certain amount of credits. They can buy 
more if they like, instead of spending money to 
change their facilities, or they can make reduc-
tions in their output, and then sell their excess 
credits to companies that need them. Many 
state legislatures in the U.S. have passed or 
proposed similar requirements.
The system was already proved to be suc-
cessful in the United States. The Clean Air Act, 
passed in 1990, sought to reduce sulfur dioxide 
emissions. Sulfur dioxide is a byproduct of burn-
ing coal to produce electricity, and it injures 
plants and fish and damages buildings when 
it’s washed back to earth through precipita-
tion, a phenomenon known as acid rain. Under 
the Clean Air Act, electric utilities were given 
sulfur dioxide credits that they could buy or sell. 
The problem was solved in seemingly no time 
because utilities had an economic incentive to 
do the right thing.
Investors can buy and sell carbon credits, and 
some do. For example, if businesses don’t get 
their emissions under control, which would 
drive up demand for and the price of credits, a 
hedge fund looking to speculate on the matter 
could buy credits now and sell them later when 
the price might be higher. In effect, the Kyoto 
Protocol turned carbon into an asset class.
The main carbon exchange is the European 
Climate Exchange (www.europeanclimate
exchange.com), also known as the ECX. 
It has built-in demand because companies in 
Europe must operate under the terms of the 
Kyoto Protocol. In the United States, green-
house gas reduction is voluntary unless a state 
law is in place. However, there’s an exchange 
here to create a market, the Chicago Climate 
Exchange (www.chicagoclimatex.
com), also known as the CCX. The founder of 
the Chicago Climate Exchange, Richard Sandor, 
developed the sulfur dioxide credit system used 
in the Clean Air Act and proposed the cap-and-
trade system written into the Kyoto Protocol.

Preventing water contamination
Water is necessary for human life. Someday we’ll figure out a way to make 
goods without using petroleum (and, in fact, alternative energy is one of 
the topics covered later in this chapter), but without water, life will cease. 
Period. Our planet has barely enough drinkable water, and desalinization 
(removing salt from water) of the oceans uses too much energy to be practi-
cal. Perhaps someday the alternative energy people can get together with the 
desalinization people to come up with a nifty solution, but that day is far off.
Drinking water comes from two places: surface water and ground water. 
Surface water includes lakes, rivers, and other bodies of water that sit on top 
of the earth’s crust. Ground water is held in soil deep below the earth, and it 
comes to the surface through natural springs and man-made wells. Pollutants 
dumped into ground water and surface water end up in drinking water, and 
chemists have found that most tap water contains a lot more than dihydro-
gen oxide (H2O) with a bit of fluoride mixed in.
The best way to keep water clean is to keep outside contaminants away 
from it. Companies can do this by developing manufacturing processes that 
use less water, pretreating water to remove noxious chemicals before it’s 
released from the factory, and properly disposing of all waste so nothing 
leeches into groundwater.
 
Bottled water isn’t the solution to clean drinking water. Many bottled water 
brands start with tap water or use the same sources. Then the water is put 
into bottles (made with petroleum and an array of other chemicals, some of 
which leech into the water) and carted around the country in trucks that run 
on gasoline or diesel fuel. Bottled water is rarely better for you than what you 
can get for a nominal cost out of your tap at home, but it does a lot more envi-
ronmental damage.
 
If you’re looking for environmentally sensitive investment options, you may 
want to look at water utilities and engineering consulting firms that special-
ize in water projects. You should also consider how other companies protect 
the water used in the course of their businesses. And, of course, you can look 
for companies that work to reduce their use of and damage to drinking water 
sources.
Scratching the surface of water
Surface water can be contaminated through a factory’s outfall pipe, which 
discharges water from the manufacturing process directly into a lake or 
river. This water may be polluted; even if it was treated or filtered before 
being released, some contaminants still may remain. Or water that collects in 
sewers after a rainstorm can pollute surface water.

138
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
The toxins can show up in drinking water, or they can be concentrated in the 
bodies of fish that may be caught and eaten later. Other chemicals can interfere 
with the growth of plants in marshy areas (know as wetlands) that help control 
flooding. And fertilizers in fresh water sometimes encourage the growth of 
bacteria that can make anyone who drinks the contaminated water very sick.
Going down for groundwater
Although people often believe that there are underground lakes and rivers, 
there aren’t. Groundwater, instead, is water stored in little spaces that form 
between bits of sand, soil, and rocks. It helps keep soil healthy, and it can be 
collected in wells to be used for drinking water. It’s usually contaminated by 
liquids that are spilled on the ground that then soak through, whether inten-
tionally or accidentally.
If the water stayed in the ground, there wouldn’t be a problem, but some of 
it is brought to the surface for drinking water, and other groundwater shoots 
through the earth as springs that feed surface water sources. The source of 
groundwater pollution can be difficult to trace, complicating the problem.
You can’t put a point on non-point source pollution
Non-point source pollution is often called runoff because it’s water that washes 
away dirt and pollutants after a rainstorm.
Think about a parking lot, which has bits of grease and oil, rubber crumbs 
from tires, dropped cigarette butts, and spilled fast food on it. Some of it’s 
harmful; some of it’s not. After a good rain, all of that crud is rinsed off the 
parking lot and goes into the surrounding soil, winding up in wells and rivers 
and other water sources.
Agriculture is another primary source of runoff. Fertilizers, pesticides, and 
bacteria-laden animal wastes wash away during rain or irrigation and end up 
in the water supply. Investors who are interested in agricultural companies 
should ask about runoff issues. Even organic farming operations can have 
runoff issues if they’re raising animals or using manure for fertilizer.
Saving the soil for greater savings
The notion of keeping dirt clean is a bit of an oxymoron. After all, it’s sup-
posed to be dirty! But soil holds a lot of not-so-good-for-us substances that 
can get loose if the land is dug up during construction or disturbed by chil-
dren playing. Those substances can also show up in fruits or vegetables 
grown on the land. And some chemicals can destroy the land’s ability to 
produce food or be put to other uses. Every community has vacant lots in 

139
 Chapter 8: Evaluating Environmental Investing
locations that would make for good playgrounds if only it were safe for chil-
dren to play there. If the ground is contaminated by lead, though, the land 
becomes worthless.
Soil can be contaminated when chemicals are spilled or run onto it, when 
chemicals in the air fall back to earth in rain, or through improper burial of 
waste products. Sometimes pollution occurs during the teardown of a previ-
ous building or the construction of a new one on the site.
Soil contamination can be expensive to remove. In many cases, the dirt has to 
be hauled away by the truckload and dumped into a landfill, which is ironic. 
One way to prevent soil contamination is to recycle more items so fewer 
things end up in landfills, which sometimes leak and contribute to soil con-
tamination. Hence, sustainable design that considers the end of the product’s 
life is an effective way to reduce soil pollution (see the earlier section “Waste 
not, want not: Waste disposal, the sustainable way” for more details).
Exploring Alternative and 
Renewable Energy
Most of our energy comes from coal, natural gas, and petroleum. These are 
carbon-based fossil fuels found in the earth, and when they’re gone, they’re 
gone. They aren’t sustainable, and they’re the primary contributors to cli-
mate change. And they aren’t cheap, either! At this writing, huge increases in 
demand from India, China, and other developing countries, along with a pro-
longed war in Iraq, are driving oil prices to record high levels. Users of fuel 
(which is pretty much everyone on this planet) are looking for alternatives, 
and savvy entrepreneurs are finding ways to make those alternatives viable.
Energy usage falls into two main categories: transportation and in-place. 
Alternative fuels for transportation are difficult to engineer because they 
have to be portable and they have to be able to handle rapidly changing rates 
of use over the time of use. Think of how often your car starts, accelerates, 
decelerates, and stops over the course of a trip to the grocery store or a road 
trip to Grandma’s. However, transportation is where the big opportunity is 
for finding alternative sources of energy. In-place energy, used for heating, 
lighting, and machine operation, is more predictable and more amenable to 
alternatives, so many alternatives are already in use.
 
As much as socially responsible investors would like to believe that everyone 
else wants to make the world better, most consumers care only about prices. 
Alternative energy will take off when it becomes cheaper than traditional fossil 
fuels, and that’s the metric that will drive the stock prices.

140
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
 
To encourage the market for alternative energy and the development of better 
technologies to make it work, the federal government and many states offer 
tax breaks and research subsidies to companies to reduce the costs. Investors 
should look at the merits of an alternative energy project with and without the 
subsidies. Few projects make economic sense without them, but some are 
closer to independent viability than others. The closer a project is to profit-
ability before subsidy, the better it should prove over the long run.
It’s back: Nuclear power
In a nuclear plant, radioactive materials generate heat that makes steam. The 
steam then powers a turbine that creates the power. But nuclear power has 
two huge drawbacks. The first is that if a plant fails, the radiation emitted can 
make the area uninhabitable for decades (Chernobyl, anyone?). The second 
is that after the fuel has been used to generate power, it’s still radioactive 
and can remain dangerous for centuries. No one knows what to do with it, so 
it sits in holding tanks very near where people live and get their water.
On the other hand (and isn’t there always another hand?), nuclear energy 
is inexpensive as long as nothing goes wrong, and it doesn’t contribute to 
climate change. Newer technologies are reducing the risk of operation and 
of problems with those spent-fuel holding tanks. Hence, some investors are 
reconsidering their aversion to nuclear power. Opportunities may come in 
the form of stock in nuclear utilities and bonds for new construction projects.
The alt-power three: Solar, 
wind, and water
In an old-fashioned electrical plant, coal heats water in a boiler that creates 
steam that turns a turbine that generates the power. A nuclear plant works 
similarly (see the preceding section).
But there are other ways to generate heat and turn turbines. Concentrated 
sunlight can turn water into steam on a small scale on the roof of a house, or 
on a huge scale by setting up racks of solar collectors out in a desert. Solar 
power can also be used to heat water, which is a major use of fuel in resi-
dential and institutional settings. (I’m not the only person who gets the best 
ideas standing under a hot shower!) Right now, solar power is more expen-
sive than coal-generated electricity, although the price may fall as technology 
improves and more large-scale projects come online. And, by definition, solar 
power requires the sun to work; it’s not practical in regions where the people 
suffer through days or even weeks of overcast skies.

141
 Chapter 8: Evaluating Environmental Investing
To harness the wind, giant windmills turn as the wind blows, cranking the 
turbines that generate electricity. The windmills don’t pollute the air, water, 
or soil, and the power is almost as free as the wind. It’s a seemingly per-
fect, clean system, except of course that it isn’t. The problems are mostly 
aesthetic; some people find that the windmills are noisy, and others think 
they’re ugly. Furthermore, they kill birds that fly into them (although at a 
much lower rate than coal-fire powered plants do), and they only work when 
it’s windy.
Water power uses rushing water to turn turbines. It can be done on an enor-
mous scale if there’s enough water; nature’s own Niagara Falls generates 1.6 
million kilowatts of electricity each day in Canada and another 2.4 million 
kilowatts in the United States. Hoover Dam, an enormous man-made struc-
ture in Nevada, produces even more power. Excluding the rare and wondrous 
Niagara Falls, almost all significant hydropower projects involve man-made 
dams that are expensive to build and usually disrupt the local ecology. 
Villages have to be relocated, wildlife dies, and acres of land are submerged 
to create a powerful fall to turn those turbines. But after the dam is built, 
hydropower is inexpensive to operate and creates no air or water pollution. 
What’s an environmental investor to do?
 
Social investing involves a lot of trade-offs. Some investors will value clean 
energy more highly than the landscape effects of solar, wind, or water power. 
Others will value preservation. You have to make your own decisions, under-
standing that perfection is an impossible goal.
Alternative energy for transportation
The current crop of alternative energy works great for buildings, but they 
aren’t so great for getting from place to place. There’s no good way to put the 
power of Niagara Falls into your car’s tank, but people are trying! Engineers 
are coming up with a lot of creative ideas for environmentally friendly alter-
natives to the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine we all know and 
love, or at least rely on to get from place to place. These alternatives include 
batteries, biofuels, and hydrogen fuel cells, and the hope is that they’ll be 
more sustainable than petroleum. Read on for a glimpse of how you may be 
powering your vehicle ten years from now!
Building a better battery
If you lived in southern Ontario or upstate New York, and if there were a 
way to run your car off of a battery that was powerful enough to get you on 
the highway, lasted long enough to get you where you needed to go, and 
recharged fast enough to keep you going, then you could power your car 
with the electricity generated by Niagara Falls. Better battery technology will 
make it possible to run a car with clean energy.

142
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Rechargeable batteries can be used now in vehicles that have light-duty 
cycles and operate at low speeds in a controlled environment, such as fork-
lifts in warehouses or cranes in heavy manufacturing plants. It’s likely that 
someday they’ll work in cars, too.
Banking on biofuels
Biofuel seems great on paper: a fuel made from plants that works in cars or 
electric power plants and grows back! We’d never run out of it. It’s been the 
great goal in alternative fuels for years now, but it’s not here yet.
Most of the work has gone into ethanol, an alcohol made from corn that can 
power cars similarly to gasoline. Ethanol works, but right now it’s not nearly 
as efficient as gasoline. When you consider all the energy that goes into grow-
ing, harvesting, and processing the corn, along with the fact that ethanol gets 
fewer miles per gallon in a car than gasoline does, it’s a losing proposition. 
That doesn’t mean it always will be a loser, but more work has to go into 
testing different plants, different processing methods, and different engine 
designs to make it more efficient.
Relying on biofuel for energy isn’t perfect. The primary use of crops is for 
food and takes priority, especially if the corn yield is poor one season.
Another alternative is biodiesel, which is nothing more than vegetable oil 
used in diesel engines. The oil can be mixed with conventional diesel fuel so 
it will work in an existing diesel engine, or the diesel engine can be modified 
to accept any vegetable oil — including leftover French-fry grease from a fast-
food restaurant. Biodiesel seems to offer similar efficiency to regular diesel, 
too, and it can sometimes be had for free. This makes it a viable option for 
those who drive cars with diesel engines.
 
One concern with biofuels and other gasoline alternatives is how to get 
them to the drivers. Gas stations won’t carry them until there’s demand, but 
demand is often limited because no gas stations carry the fuel! My bet is that 
as soon as someone develops a low-cost biofuel that works as well as gasoline 
in a car, the demand will spike so quickly that every gas station will figure out 
a way to get the fuel. In the meantime, no less a personage than country singer 
Willie Nelson is trying to sign up truck stops to offer biodiesel, and many farm 
communities in the Midwest have gas stations offering an ethanol pump (usu-
ally subsidized by the state department of agriculture or other agency, but at 
least they’re out there).
Fine-tuning fuel cells
A fuel cell is similar to a battery in that it’s a device that stores energy. It’s 
different in that it works by creating a chemical reaction that generates 
electricity. The chemical that creates the reaction has to be replenished on 
occasion. Most work to date has been done with hydrogen, and it’s still not 
cost-effective.

143
 Chapter 8: Evaluating Environmental Investing
Although there’s been a lot of excitement about fuel cells for cars, no one 
has been able to build an efficient fuel-cell vehicle at a reasonable price. In 
the meantime, engineers are looking at fuel cells for stationary applications, 
including as backup generators, that may be able to complement other elec-
tric car technologies.
Accounting for Animal Welfare
Human beings aren’t the only creatures in our environment. We share a 
planet with lots of animals, but we don’t always treat them well. Many inves-
tors want to make sure that the businesses they invest in treat animals fairly 
and humanely — if the businesses have anything at all to do with animals. 
The two biggest issues are animal testing and the treatment of livestock. In 
this section, I cover these hot issues so you know what to look for.
Responsible testing
Many products are tested on animals before they’re tested on humans. 
Potential new food additives are tried out in animals first to see whether 
they’re poisonous, and promising pharmaceuticals are tested in animals to 
see what effects they may have. Scientists have developed mice that are guar-
anteed to get certain diseases so researchers can learn more about fighting 
cancer or heart disease. But although there are valid reasons to use animals 
in testing, not all tests of toxicity and performance have to be done on ani-
mals; if animal testing needs to be done, the animals should be treated well 
and kept free from pain.
 
The Humane Society of the United States has a lot of information about animal 
testing and alternatives to it that can help guide your investing decisions. You 
can find it on the organization’s Web site, www.hsus.org/animals_in_
research/animal_testing.
How is livestock treated?
Plenty of people are all right with killing animals for food, but they believe 
that those animals should be treated well before they’re slaughtered. Not 
all animals are, and many investors in restaurant and food-processing com-
panies want to know that animals are raised well before being given a quick 
death.

One of the leading companies in this area is McDonald’s. After years of criti-
cism, the company worked with Temple Grandin, a veterinarian who special-
izes in the design of livestock-handling facilities. With her help, McDonald’s 
drew up requirements for its suppliers to ensure that the animals used to 
make its burgers are kept healthy, treated well, and are free from pain at 
the time of death. It backs up its principles with an inspection program. No 
matter what you think about Big Macs, McDonald’s work has put pressure on 
other food processors to make improvements.
 
McDonald’s policies, which are considered to be a model for the industry, 
are published on its Web site, www.mcdonalds.com/corp/values/
purchasing/animalwelfare.html. You can use them to help evaluate 
investments in the food business.
Striking a Balance Between the 
Environment and Investors
The environment is all about warm-and-fuzzy nature loving, while the finan-
cial markets are about cold, hard cash, right? Well, sort of. The financial 
markets are about money and little else, but if money is to be made on taking 
care of the environment, then the markets love it.
I wish I could say that investing in environmentally responsible companies 
always generates huge returns for investors, but the statistical evidence 
is mixed. Investing along environmental lines is no surefire path to riches. 
But no investment program is. So while finance students write dissertations 
trying to prove the relationship between the environment and the markets 
five years ago, you have to do your research and monitor your investments 
now (I cover those topics in Chapters 4 and 5). In this section, I let you know 
what to look for and consider so you can make the best environmentally 
based investment decisions.
Looking at statistics realistically
The research to date on environmental investing is a bit mixed: It shows 
that environmental investing doesn’t necessarily lead to bigger profits, but it 
doesn’t necessarily hurt investment returns, either. That’s important to know, 
because some financial advisors will tell you that social investing always leads 
to poor performance. Here are the findings of some recent studies:

145
 Chapter 8: Evaluating Environmental Investing
 
✓ Andreas Ziegler, Michael Schröder, and Klaus Rennings of the Center for 
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability at the University of Zurich 
found that industries that had better sustainability performance had 
better stock market performance than industries that were not focused 
on sustainability efforts. But companies that had better sustainable per-
formance relative to their industry didn’t seem to be rewarded by the 
stock market. (“The Effect of Environmental and Social Performance on 
the Stock Performance of European Corporations,” Environmental and 
Resource Economics, August 2007)
 
✓ A 2001 study by Shameek Konar and Mark A. Cohen found that a 10 
percent reduction in the emission of toxic chemicals led to a $34 million 
increase in a company’s stock market value. (“Does the Market Value 
Environmental Performance?” Review of Economics and Statistics, 
May 2001)
 
✓ A paper presented at Oxford University in 2007 by Vanda Roque and 
Maria Céu Cortez found that the more environmental information that 
Portuguese companies gave investors, the worse the stocks performed! 
(“The Relationship between Corporate Environmental and Financial 
Performance: Evidence for Portuguese listed corporations,” working 
paper)
So does all of this mean the environmentally concerned investor is doomed? 
No. You just have to do your research to ensure that your environmental 
investment is also financially sound.
 
One problem with academic research is that it looks backward. A researcher 
gets an idea, known as a hypothesis, and then goes back to see if the historic 
data support or refute it. As investors know, past performance does not 
indicate future results. Just because the research so far doesn’t show a great 
connection between the environment and stock returns doesn’t mean that it 
never will. Nor does it mean that the investment you may be considering is a 
bad one.
Appealing to consumers for better sales
The first thing a business has to do to make a profit is generate sales. It has 
to persuade customers that its goods and services are worth paying for. 
Green (or, as I’ve called it in this chapter, sustainable) products or services 
are hot because customers are factoring green credentials into their purchas-
ing decisions.

146
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
A 2008 survey conducted by the Boston College Center for Corporate 
Citizenship and Cone, a marketing communications firm, found that 59 per-
cent of American consumers are concerned about the environment and are 
either consuming less or are seeking out products that are environmentally 
friendly. (You can see all the details at www.coneinc.com/content1135.) 
With more than half of customers thinking about the environment when they 
shop, a savvy corporation needs to think about the environment, too, or be 
prepared to watch its revenues go to competitors that show more concern.
By going green, a business can stand out and attract customers who want to 
shop responsibly. The green movement can help the company grow its top 
line and, it is hoped, bring some of those gains down as profits.
Controlling costs for bigger profits
Helping the environment doesn’t have to cost a lot. In many cases, it can be 
a real money saver, and that’s good for you as an investor. After all, the less 
money a company spends, the bigger its profits will be, and profits drive 
returns. Even better, a company can save money lots of ways while helping 
the environment.
Beware of greenwashing!
Watch out for greenwashing, which is the prac-
tice of making it seem like a product is good 
for the environment even if it isn’t. Because 
so many buyers not only seek out environ-
mentally friendly products, but they’ll also pay 
extra for them, a lot of companies want to be 
perceived as making environmentally friendly 
products. And if they don’t? Well, the market-
ing department will create ads showing scenic 
vistas, redesign packages to use earth tones, 
and create taglines that talk about caring for 
the environment — without the company actu-
ally making costly or risky changes in product 
formulation or manufacture.
Some businesses take it further and lie. For 
example, a gym clothing company claimed to be 
using a special fiber made from fast-growing, 
renewable seaweed that had special proteins 
to destress and detoxify the wearer, but inde-
pendent testing showed that the material was 
plain old cotton. The Cone and Boston College 
study mentioned earlier in this chapter found 
that 90 percent of consumers surveyed expect 
companies to prove that their products are good 
for the environment, not just talk about it.

147
 Chapter 8: Evaluating Environmental Investing
Producing and selling products generates costs. And below the cost-of-
goods-sold line come all kinds of operating costs that companies incur but 
that aren’t directly tied to products and services. Some of these costs can be 
avoided by hugging some trees while running the business. I cover many of 
these issues in the section “Factoring in Sustainability,” earlier in this chap-
ter, but here’s a quick-and-dirty breakdown of what you should look for in the 
ways companies control their costs:
 
✓ Manufacturing and retailing costs: For most manufacturing companies, 
the largest cost item is cost of goods sold, which is everything that goes 
into making the product. If the company can find ways to save energy 
and water, use sustainable materials, reduce waste in manufacturing, 
and then reduce the amount of packaging needed to get the goods out 
the door, it can generate real cost savings.
 
 Companies other than manufacturers can employ similar strategies, too. 
A retailer or a service company can find ways to use more-efficient light-
ing, insulate space for cheaper and better heating and cooling, and make 
wiser decisions about office supplies, furniture, and fixtures.
 
✓ Travel and shipping costs: Because so many companies have to get 
people or goods from one point to another, they can find ways to save by 
using fuel-efficient vehicles, lighter packaging materials that cost less to 
ship, and possibly by making people stay put from time to time. For exam-
ple, a round-trip flight between New York and Los Angeles generates 2.46 
metric tons of carbon dioxide, not to mention the cost of the ticket and 
the hotel room. If just one meeting per year can be replaced with a confer-
ence call or Webcast, then the environment and the corporation benefits.
 
 You can calculate estimated carbon usage at www.carboncounter.
org, a site put together by the Climate Trust, a nonprofit organization 
that lets people and businesses purchase offsets for their carbon emis-
sions. Of course, if you don’t emit the carbon in the first place, you 
won’t need to pay for the offsets!
 
✓ Marketing: It’s entirely possible that a company will even save money 
on marketing expenses after its environmentally conscious consumers 
find out about its good works through news reports, blog postings, or 
word of mouth from like-minded friends. (It will save even more if it can 
avoid the sort of environmental disaster, such as contaminated drinking 
water or a deadly chemical leak, that requires the use of SWAT teams of 
damage-control experts.)
 
✓ Waste management: Businesses generate trash. Any reduction in trash 
from less upfront consumption and more reuse and recycling saves 
money in terms of waste hauling and landfill fees. Some businesses gen-
erate hazardous wastes. Handling those so they don’t contaminate the 
environment may cost a little extra money upfront, but it will pay off 
down the road when the company can avoid the expense of regulatory 
fines and remediation.

148
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
 
✓ Insurance: If a business is run so that it has less risk of creating environ-
mental damage in its business processes, waste management, or prod-
ucts, it may be able to save money on insurance fees. If the company 
reduces the likelihood that it will have a problem, it will pay less. The 
shareholders, meanwhile, make more. Hurray!
Accounting for long-term liabilities
The way to hit a corporation where it hurts is to make it record a balance 
sheet liability. First, the company has to take a charge to income to show the 
expense. Then it has that great big number sitting on its balance sheet for 
investors to pester it about for years to come. Ouch!
Thanks to Financial Standards Accounting Board Standard 5, known as FASB 5 
to its friends (and FASB, by the way, is pronounced fahz-bee), companies have 
to report long-term environmental liabilities on their balance sheets. FASB 5, 
Accounting for Contingent Liabilities, says a company has to record a liability 
when it
 
✓ Has reason to know that it has a liability when the income statement is 
prepared, and
 
✓ Has a reasonable estimate of its cost
A related standard, FASB 144, covers the disposal of an asset that is impaired, 
such as a contaminated parcel of land that the firm wants to sell. It, too, calls 
for the creation of a liability on the balance sheet.
You can find out about these liabilities by looking at a company’s balance 
sheet and reading the footnotes to its financial statements. (See Chapter 4 for 
more on financial statements.)
 
These liabilities may limit the amount of money that a firm can borrow, but 
they also may not be accurate. If the amount on the balance sheet is too low, 
the company will have to take another charge at some point to bring it up to 
size. If it’s too large, the company will get to reverse it and show a boost to 
reported income.
 
A balance sheet liability for environmental damage isn’t created when the 
damage occurs. Instead, it comes up when some kind of enforcement action or 
site analysis shows the extent of the problem and a recommendation for reme-
diation gives the company an estimate of the cost. Plenty of companies have 
environmental problems that aren’t on their balance sheets.

149
 Chapter 8: Evaluating Environmental Investing
You can do all of your homework to ensure that the company you invest in 
has clean production processes, is an innovator in sustainability, and gen-
erally goes out of its way to be a leader on environmental issues, but that 
doesn’t mean you’re safe. A company can find itself liable today for pollu-
tion that occurred decades ago, before we had a good understanding of the 
effects of all of these different substances in the air, water, and soil — and 
before regulation gave companies a reason to do something about them. 
Sometimes a company will take on a problem through an acquisition.
Because of the long life of environmental contaminants, it’s important that 
companies do the right thing now, even if there’s no regulatory incentive to 
do so. That will lead to better profits over the long haul. On the other hand, 
investors need to remember that just because a company has environmental 
liabilities on the balance sheet, it’s not necessarily an evil polluter. It may 
simply be dealing with something that happened years ago under a different 
management and a different view of the world.
 
Some line items will rule a company in or out for different social investors. A 
balance sheet liability is not one of those; it’s merely a sign to dig deeper.
Real cost savings from sustainable investments
Being good to the environment can bring money 
to an organization’s bottom line, and that’s good 
for investors. Whether you’re buying stocks or 
bonds, corporate or municipal securities, you 
may like the looks of these dollar savings:
 ✓ Hormel Foods (makers of Spam, among 
other fine products) estimates that it saved 
more than $1.1 million in 2006 by reduc-
ing the amount of waste sent to landfills. 
Also, Hormel spent about $12.5 million for 
water in 2006, and has set a goal of reduc-
ing water use by 2 percent per year for five 
years. Anticipated cost savings in 2011: 
$1.2 million, assuming utilities don’t charge 
Hormel more for the water it uses. Would 
investors like another $1.2M of profit?
 ✓ The City of Chicago introduced a recycling 
program in selected wards in 2007. The 
city estimates that each ton of recycled 
waste will generate $110 — partly from the 
price that vendors will pay for recyclables 
and partly from the avoided landfill fees. 
The avoided landfill fees are as important as 
the revenue from aluminum and recycled 
paper pulp.
 ✓ Baxter, maker of medical supplies, esti-
mates that it enjoyed a savings of $8.5 mil-
lion as a result of its energy conservation 
initiative in 2005, and $23.6 million in cost 
avoidance or income from all environmen-
tal activities in 2005.
 ✓ Electronics giant Sony estimates that it 
recycled or reused 173,000 tons of waste 
out of a total of 193,000 tons generated in 
2007, thus avoiding 173,000 tons of landfill 
fees. The company has not quantified the 
savings; because the recycling took place 
all over the world, it is difficult to apply U.S. 
rates.

M
ultinational corporations answer to no one but shareholders (and 
maybe customers), so shareholders often push companies to do 
the right thing when deciding whether to do business in nations that don’t 
support human rights or that are engaged in civil conflicts. In fact, social 
investing gained traction as a protest technique against South Africa’s former 
apartheid (discrimination against non-Whites) policies, which have now 
ended. Morals aside, behaving well, no matter what the laws of the land are, 
can help a company reduce its risk and enhance its value with customers, 
warming the hearts of even the most ruthlessly capitalistic investors.
It’s not perfect. Some people resent it when a big corporation tells them 
that the local way of doing business is wrong, even if that local way involves 
discrimination against minorities and bribes to local officials. Others think 
that companies shouldn’t be doing a government’s work. Governments, not 
mining companies, should provide healthcare; governments, not clothing 
manufacturers, should provide schools; governments, not engineering-
construction firms, should work to prevent corruption. But if the government 
can’t or won’t meet its civic duties, it may turn to others with money and 
power to make a difference, and that’s often a multinational corporation.
This chapter starts with an overview of the structure and mission of the 
typical multinational corporation. I also cover some of the key issues facing 
global companies, especially when they’re doing business in developing 

152
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
nations where human rights may not be respected and where the risk of war 
may be great. That way, when you do your research (see Chapter 5), you 
know what to look for. After all, companies won’t give you a lot of this infor-
mation. You have to find much of it yourself from news sources.
The goal is to help investors who care about international relations to deter-
mine whether the companies that they’re interested in share the goal of a 
better life for the 6 billion of us who share the planet.
Scrutinizing the Global 
Mega-Corporation
The biggest corporations in the world are no longer tied to their headquar-
ters location. In 2007, Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) generated just 26.9 percent of its 
revenue from North America. McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD) took in 34.7 percent 
of its revenue from the United States, while Unilever (LSE: ULVR.L), based in 
the UK, collected only 37.8 percent of its revenue from Europe. Even compa-
nies that draw most of their revenue in only one nation may have close ties to 
other countries as sources of raw materials or inventories. The world’s big-
gest companies, and many of its medium and small ones, have such diverse 
businesses that they no longer belong to any one nation. They are the true 
global citizens, getting things done all over the world.
In a way, this means that these corporations are beholden to no one nation, 
either. If the Canadian government starts to be a bother, it’s no big deal; 
there are plenty of sales to be found in Mexico. In a strange way, these multi-
nationals are more accountable to shareholders and customers than to any 
set of regulators or politicians.
Companies have been known to move headquarters if they don’t like what’s 
happening in their hometown. Some set up legal shop in such tax havens as 
Bermuda; others merge with a company in another country and move the 
headquarters there. But company management can’t force any shareholders 
to sell unless the entire company is sold, so it can’t run from activist inves-
tors. Furthermore, any management team worth its salt (or salary) wants to 
attract customers rather than drive them away.
 
U.S. companies can be found liable in courts here for violating human rights 
abroad. That’s under the Alien Tort Claims Act of 1789. Yes, it’s that old, but 
it has modern applications. The act gave U.S. courts jurisdiction over the civil 
actions of U.S. citizens committed in violation of U.S. laws and treaties, no 
matter where those actions took place. Under U.S. law, a corporation is treated 
as an individual person for civil actions, so the law applies. If a U.S. company 
operating overseas has a security guard who falsely imprisons or tortures an 
employee suspected of theft, the company can be on the hook here.

153
 Chapter 9: The World around Us: Following International Affairs
Maximizing shareholder value(s)
The modern corporation is operated for the benefit of the shareholders, 
who are legally the owners of the company. It should be run to get as great a 
profit as possible over the long term, which may involve spending now so the 
business can thrive for years to come. The shareholders want the business 
to be run in a responsible way. Otherwise, the company can end up losing 
customers, spending money on lawyers and fines, and getting taken over by a 
hostile government.
Some socially responsible shareholders are leery of the biggest and most 
multi of the major multinational companies because they have so little 
accountability to any one government. If those companies are accountable 
to shareholders and if those shareholders have an interest in keeping their 
investment viable for the long term, then shareholders can drive oversight. 
(You can read more about corporate governance and the role of sharehold-
ers in Chapter 7.)
 
As the world’s markets become more sophisticated and workers in places 
that were once desperately poor earn their way out of poverty, more national 
governments will be able to face a multinational corporation from a position 
of strength. Business can create the economic development that gets people 
out of poverty. A responsible corporation is an asset to the world, not just to 
socially responsible shareholders.
The (global) customer is always right
The customer is always right, department-store magnate Marshall Field 
is supposed to have said. Granted, some customers just want whatever is 
cheapest, no matter how those savings were attained, but others want some 
assurance that their money went for fair wages to workers, as well as to prof-
its for the company, and that the goods aren’t contaminated with lead paint. 
Some want an assurance that the goods they purchase were made with sus-
tainable materials (which you can find out more about in Chapter 8).
 
If the customer is always right, then one reason companies pay workers 
rock-bottom wages and cut corners on the manufacturing process is to pass 
on rock-bottom prices to their customers. Are you willing to pay more for a 
T-shirt or new toy to ensure that the makers receive a fair wage?
The fallout from cutting costs and taking shortcuts can be huge. Two U.S. toy-
makers, Mattel (NYSE: MAT) and RC2 Corp., recalled millions of toys in 2007 
because contractors in China used lead paint on them. In 1996, television per-
sonality Kathie Lee Gifford was thrilled to announce her new line of clothing 
for Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT); neither she nor the shoppers were thrilled to find 
out that much of the manufacturing work was done by children in Honduras. 

154
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
In order to stave off consumer boycotts, other brand-name shoe and clothing 
companies, including Nike (NYSE: NKE), Gap (NYSE: GPS), and Levi Strauss, 
have had to change their sourcing practices to assure that products are 
made by workers who are treated well.
It’s not just U.S. consumers who care about how products are made and 
promoted. Multinational corporations entering new markets have had to 
hire local workers, use local banks and ad agencies, and participate in local 
activities to show that they have a commitment to the customers there. 
McDonald’s and Coca-Cola want to be global brands that are loved by people 
everywhere, not “something better” offered by Americans. That way, they 
can attract local customers by being local themselves.
How corporations work with governments
Although a global corporation has less government accountability than a 
corporation that operates in only one nation, that doesn’t mean it can ignore 
governments and regulators. Instead, it has to figure out ways to get things 
done given the law of the land.
 
Companies have a way of saying that something is impossible in one market 
but is doable in another. For example, many multinationals complain that 
it would be impossible to meet increased environmental regulations in the 
United States, even though they’re already meeting stricter standards in 
Europe. This is a negotiating tactic. A creative management team finds ways 
to get things done, so activist shareholders should be skeptical of the “we 
couldn’t possibly” argument.
Big companies often take a different approach to compliance in different 
countries in order to meet the requirements of a local market. In most cases, 
this is a fine adjustment to the realities of commerce, but it may not always 
be. Some companies have been known to resort to bribery (which I cover 
later in this chapter); others have been known to act against stated corporate 
values in the interests of expediency.
Internet companies Yahoo! (Nasdaq: YHOO) and Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) 
have cooperated with the Chinese government by releasing information on 
users that have helped the government track dissidents and by developing 
search algorithms that limit the access of Chinese users to certain types of 
information that the Chinese government views as inappropriate. Both com-
panies argued that it is better to have some presence in China than not, but 
not all shareholders and customers were convinced. (Note that Google’s cor-
porate motto is “Don’t be evil.”)
Not to pick on Yahoo! and Google, but that’s a huge challenge that companies 
face. Because different nations have different laws, a multinational corpora-
tion may find itself in compliance but with angry activist investors.

155
 Chapter 9: The World around Us: Following International Affairs
Many companies go well beyond the letter of law; think of consumer product 
companies that transfer sustainable practices required in Europe to the U.S., 
where it’s not required, or clothing manufacturers that only hire adults, even 
if the local law allows them to hire children. Others use their financial power 
to lobby for changes that make a difference. If shareholders support actions 
that may be costly in the short term but are the right thing to do in the long 
run, companies are more likely to do the right thing.
Most companies are scrupulous about at least the appearance of political 
neutrality. They tend to emphasize good corporate governance instead of 
any one set of policies or another, because becoming embroiled in a messy 
political battle can backfire with customers and make operations difficult in 
years to come. For example, in the United States, where politicians expect 
businesses to make campaign contributions, most companies simply contrib-
ute a more or less equal amount to all candidates in a given race.
Human Rights: What’s the Company’s 
Global Approach?
Companies are collections of human beings. The shareholders are human 
beings; even big institutions, like mutual funds or pensions, manage money 
for the benefit of individuals. The members of the board of directors are 
human beings, as are the managers and other employees. The customers are 
human, too; even business and government buyers are collections of people 
who actually make the decisions and use the products. The big behemoth 
corporation will cry when poked!
Ah, but as we all know, human beings don’t always treat each other very well. 
And sometimes, a corporation contributes to the problems. As a social inves-
tor looking at international companies, you want to know more about their 
stances on human rights. This section is a guide to some of the key issues, 
which include the treatment of minorities, the source of the workers them-
selves, and the rights of workers in the workplace. (I look at domestic work-
place issues in Chapter 11.)
 
A great resource for investors and managers who are concerned about the 
human rights issues facing multinational corporations is the Business Leaders 
Initiative in Human Rights, www.blihr.org. It’s a group of 13 multinational 
corporations chaired by Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland, and 
supported by the United Nations. The organization’s mission is to help busi-
nesses find practical ways to apply the United Nations Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights. The Web site has some great information on the issues that 
companies face, as well as some possible solutions.

156
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Speaking for the minorities
For all sorts of reasons, many places in the world have institutionalized dis-
crimination. It may be along racial, ethnic, religious, or social class lines; one 
group is on top, one is at the bottom, and that’s just how it is. Some countries 
allow it by law and others by custom. But that doesn’t make it right.
It’s easy for the best-meaning company to make mistakes if it’s not paying 
attention. Offering hiring preferences for friends and relatives of current 
employees may help a company bring in people who are known to be good 
workers, but it may also reinforce the demographics of the staff rather than 
help diversify it (see the later section “Saying no to nepotism — most of the 
time” for more on this topic). Advertising job openings in just one newspa-
per, at just one school, or on just one Web site will bring in the readers, stu-
dents, and users of just one type rather than a greater mix of people.
Employment isn’t the only issue. Companies must be sensitive to other cul-
tural norms that are important to their customers. New construction projects 
may interfere with sacred sites or religious rituals. Advertising campaigns 
that are funny to one culture may be offensive to another. Food ingredients 
may contain items that are taboo to some religious groups. Being respectful 
to others is hard work, but it helps companies maintain strong ties to cus-
tomers, and they’re the people who generate the revenues.
Preventing discrimination with the 
MacBride Principles
Sean MacBride was an Irish politician 
who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974 for 
his work in promoting peace in Northern 
Ireland and elsewhere in the world. In 
1984, he and the Irish National Caucus 
proposed what are known as the MacBride 
Principles, which were designed to help 
international companies doing business 
in Northern Ireland avoid discrimination 
against Roman Catholics, which was ram-
pant in the province and contributed to the 
violence there. The MacBride Principles 
are still used as a model to help interna-
tional companies overcome local preju-
dices anywhere in the world. They call for
 ✓ Increasing the representation of individuals 
from underrepresented groups in the work-
force at all levels, including managerial, 
supervisory, administrative, clerical, and 
technical jobs.
 ✓ Providing adequate security for the 
protection of minority employees at the 
workplace.
 ✓ Banning provocative sectarian or political 
emblems from the workplace.
 ✓ Providing that all job openings be advertised 
publicly and providing that special recruit-
ment efforts be made to attract applicants 
from underrepresented groups.

 Chapter 9: The World around Us: Following International Affairs
Facing the reasons for 
forced and child labor
Although few businesses engage in outright slavery (often called forced 
labor), some have practices that are mighty close. For example, if a worker 
has to live in a company dorm and can eat only at the company cafeteria, but 
if the wages barely cover the cost, it may be construed as slavery. Some com-
panies provide transportation to workers to get them to the job site, and then 
expect the workers to stay until they pay back the cost — which may roughly 
equal the wages they would be expected to make over the next five years. In 
a few countries, prisoners can be hired to do assembly work on a contract 
basis, and they may be forced to work as a condition of their incarceration.
Related to the issue of forced labor is the use of child labor — workers under 
the age of 17 and sometimes as young as 4. Some manufacturing plants like to 
use children because they’re obedient; they can be intimidated and don’t talk 
back. Sometimes the parents, not the employer, force the children to work, 
which creates a forced-labor dynamic even if the company isn’t behind it. 
Although it’s true that a child is better off having a job than dying of starva-
tion, it’s the responsibility of government, not business, to provide a basic 
safety net for its people. And it’s a corporation’s responsibility to pay its 
adult workers enough that they can provide food for their children.
Note that both of these issues are related to paying workers a fair wage. Pay 
people enough money, and you won’t have to force them to work. Pay them 
enough money, and they’ll be able to earn enough so their children don’t 
have to work. Furthermore, workers should be able to earn that fair wage in a 
reasonable amount of time. Sure, investment bankers and doctors may work 
80 or 100 hours a week, but they’re making a lot more than $0.75 per hour, 
and they’re free to quit at any time.
 ✓ Providing that layoff, recall, and termina-
tion procedures do not favor a particular 
group.
 ✓ Abolishing job reservations, apprentice-
ships restrictions, and differential employ-
ment criteria that discriminate. This may 
mean restricting hiring preferences for 
relatives of current employees.
 ✓ Providing for the development of train-
ing programs that will prepare substantial 
numbers of minority employees for skilled 
jobs, including the expansion of existing 
programs and the creation of new programs 
to train, upgrade, and improve the skills of 
minority employees.
 ✓ Establishing procedures to assess, identify, 
and actively recruit minority employees 
with the potential for further advancement.
 ✓ Providing for the appointment of a senior 
management staff member to be responsi-
ble for the employment efforts of the entity 
and, within a reasonable period of time, the 
implementation of the principles described 
above.

Part II: Issues to Invest In 
The sticky issue with forced and child labor is the use of contractors. Few 
retailers make what they sell. Many corporations view their strength as being 
in design and marketing, not in manufacture. These businesses hire other 
companies (contractors) to do the assembly work. In some cases, those con-
tractors hire subcontractors to do the work. Too often, decisions are made 
based only on the lowest price, and the lower the price, the less money there 
is to pay the workers.
Investors in companies that operate manufacturing plants in low-wage coun-
tries or that use contractors in those markets should make sure policies are 
in place against the use of forced and child labor. If a company relies on con-
tractors, it should have a certification process enforced with inspections and 
the potential loss of the contract to ensure that the work is being performed 
by adults who can choose the work.
 
The National Labor Committee, www.nlcnet.org, is a coalition of labor, 
human rights, and religious organizations that monitors conditions in manu-
facturing facilities all over the world. The Web site has information on current 
problems as well as details of past campaigns so investors can find out more 
about the issues and the companies involved.
Standing up for rights in the workplace
They should be lucky they have a job and not complain, you may say, but 
workers do complain. And while some of those complaints can be chalked up 
to human nature, others are valid, and businesses should respect the work-
ers’ rights to make them.
A common complaint among workers concerns their security and safety 
in the workplace. Companies should make sure that their managers aren’t 
taking bribes or asking employees for favors as a condition of employment, 
that sexual and ethnic harassment isn’t tolerated, and that the workplace is 
safe. Employees should not be locked in, exposed to toxic chemicals, or use 
dangerous machinery without adequate safety protections. They should have 
access to bathrooms and be given lunch breaks.
A more challenging right for many companies is the workers’ right to orga-
nize into labor unions. Some businesses are offended by the idea of unions; 
the managers want to think that they’re doing such a great job that the work-
ers should be happy with what they have. Others see a union as something 
that will create obstacles to getting work done and lead to significant reduc-
tions in profits. To combat unions, companies have done everything from 
limiting the rights of workers to chat in the lunchroom to hiring private inves-
tigators to threaten — or commit — bodily harm against organizers.

159
 Chapter 9: The World around Us: Following International Affairs
A company may very well be able to head off union activity by running a clean 
workplace and treating employees well. But if there’s talk of a union being 
formed, workers should have the basic right to congregate after hours and to 
discuss it in the workplace as long as they’re getting the job at hand done.
War, Peace, and Profit
In his book The Lexus and the Olive Tree, New York Times writer Thomas L. 
Friedman posed the Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention: No nation that 
had a McDonald’s had ever declared war on another nation with a McDonald’s 
after both nations had a franchise. The fast-food restaurant’s presence was a 
sign of economic progress that no one wanted to jeopardize with a war. The 
theory has been disproved: Several different global skirmishes have occurred 
between French fry–loving nations, including decades of hostilities between 
Israel and Lebanon and the 1999 U.S. bombing of Kosovo. That doesn’t 
discredit the logic behind Friedman’s theory, though. As a nation becomes 
more economically developed, it has more to lose in a war, so it has a greater 
incentive to solve its problems through diplomatic means.
Still, the peoples of the world are not all sitting down in harmony to share the 
toys in their respective Happy Meals. War is an unfortunate reality, and com-
panies doing business across borders need to be careful that their behavior 
doesn’t exacerbate conflicts already in place. And if the company is operating 
when conflict heats up, it needs to take precautions to protect its employees 
and its business.
Appropriate appropriation prevention
For a business, the worst thing that can happen is that the business is taken 
over by the government (this action is called an appropriation). It’s a real 
possibility during a war or political revolution. Buildings can be taken over, 
restaurants burned to the ground, and airlines nationalized in the name of 
whoever is now in charge. When the soldiers show up, few love their jobs 
enough to fight.
The usual tactic for businesses facing appropriation is to get employees out, 
lock up the doors, and then use diplomatic channels to try to get either the 
business back or get compensation for it. Of course, negotiating for repara-
tions can prolong conflicts; one of the many obstacles to the normalization 
of relations between the United States and Cuba is determining how to 
compensate people whose homes and businesses were appropriated by the 
Communists.

160
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
To minimize the cost of appropriation, companies often find ways to spread 
the investment around. Instead of owning a building in a troubled area, a 
company may lease it from a local landowner, which passes the risk on to 
someone else. It may use leases on heavy equipment, so it’s easy to walk 
away from the payments if it also has to give up the use. And a company may 
try to get as much cash as possible into banks in safer countries by trans-
ferring funds; if the government limits funds transfers (a common form of 
appropriation), a company may be able to get money out of the country by 
charging the local office fees for such interdepartmental services as informa-
tion technology, accounting, and human resources management.
 
Appropriation doesn’t have to involve the takeover of a business by force as 
an act of war. Another form of appropriation is if a government changes its 
policies to make a business obsolete. If the United States were to offer single-
payer national health insurance for all citizens, not just those over the age 
of 65, the insurance companies may perceive that as appropriation. Hence, 
appropriation is a risk for all businesses, not just those in conflict areas.
Working in a hot spot
It seems like the logical answer to dealing with war is to pack it up, go home, 
and let the soldiers fight it out among themselves. Logical, maybe, but not 
practical. Shutting down the business may be taken as a sign of capitulation 
to one of the warring parties, and it results in lost livelihood for the workers 
there. A first step is basic risk assessment: Who is fighting, where, and how? 
If the fighting is hundreds of miles away, with a desert in between, there’s 
less risk to people or property than if the business is next door. If it’s a con-
flict that plays out in one bombing every six months, then the risk is different 
than if trench warfare is taking place in the next block. The next step is to 
ensure that workers are protected.
 
Every company has to make its own decisions depending on its business and 
the conflict at hand. The point for you to remember is this: It’s not necessar-
ily wrong for a company to operate in a war zone, nor is it necessarily wrong 
to back out even if it leads to a higher level of destabilization in a region. It 
depends on the unique circumstances of the war.
Responsibility and the defense contractor
Operating in a war zone takes on a particular urgency for companies in the 
defense business. Some simply make parts and supplies that soldiers use, but 
other defense contractors take over military functions, including providing 
security, managing prisoners of war, and operating certain types of equip-
ment. Many defense contractors get work only when hostilities flair, but they 
still must be responsible about how they do their jobs.

161
 Chapter 9: The World around Us: Following International Affairs
 
This is not an issue for some social investors, because many refuse to invest 
in defense contractors under any circumstances. But other investors will con-
sider military businesses because these companies fit their own definition of 
social responsibility.
The rules for defense contractors are simple: Nonstate actors, like defense con-
tractors working in a war zone, are bound by international humanitarian laws, 
including the Geneva Conventions. Defense contractors need to protect people 
who don’t participate in the fighting (such as civilians, medics, and clergy), as 
well as those who no longer can (injured soldiers, prisoners of war, and ship-
wrecked sailors). To behave otherwise is to commit a war crime, no matter 
what the contract calls for. To read more about the Geneva Conventions, look 
on the International Committee of the Red Cross’s Web site, www.icrc.org/
Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/genevaconventions.
Transitioning to peace
Businesses have an inherent interest in a peaceful world, because it’s a lot 
easier to get work done when people aren’t fighting. However, new peace is 
fragile and creates challenges for the businesses trying to get back to normal. 
Not everyone in a country may accept the outcome of the war, and some 
may see the shaky new start as an opportunity to create more conflict. At the 
same time, the citizens may be too tired to go back to work, especially if they 
have lost relatives or houses.
Promoting peace, one diamond at a time
Diamonds are gorgeous stones, and they’re 
practical, too: They’re so hard that they can be 
worn all the time, unlike such softer gems as 
opals and emeralds. Unfortunately, diamonds 
are often found in places suffering from com-
plicated politics and outright war. Because 
diamonds have great value relative to their 
size, they can be smuggled between places. 
In Africa, many military leaders and terrorist 
groups have used diamonds to finance their 
military activities, giving the stones the nick-
name blood diamonds or conflict diamonds. 
There’s no way to tell where a diamond came 
from, so concern about trade in conflict dia-
monds hurts sales of diamonds that come from 
legitimate dealers.
The Kimberley Process was developed by dia-
mond-producing and -importing nations in 2003 
to create a certification program for diamonds 
that weren’t used in conflict trade. It requires 
that diamonds shipped across international 
borders be carried in tamper-proof contain-
ers and accompanied by a government-issued, 
forgery-resistant certificate that lists each 
container’s contents. The only governments 
authorized to participate are those that are 
committed to keeping conflict diamonds out of 
their inventories, and 74 countries participate 
now. It’s not perfect — conflict diamonds still 
get traded — but it has made the diamond trade 
much cleaner. It also shows how businesses 
and governments can work together to help 
promote peace.

162
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
On the other hand, peace creates opportunities, because the nation will 
probably need to have its infrastructure reconstructed. The World Bank has 
financed most of the major postwar redevelopment projects in the world 
over the years, and it has a great collection of information for investors and 
others at www.worldbank.org/conflict.
Some of the principles that the World Bank promotes for managing in a newly 
peaceful region include
 
✓ Hire local labor. People will want to get back to work, and their involve-
ment will help the project be successful and improve the chance of tran-
sitioning to peace.
 
✓ Accept popular sovereignty. Even if the new government in charge is 
not the CEO’s first choice, it’s still the government, and if the people 
support it, so should businesses.
 
✓ Have a strategy for managing corruption. A postwar region is often 
awash in aid money, has a weak government with bigger priorities than 
policing bribes, and is home to a lot of people looking to make a quick 
buck after a period of deprivation. Businesses working in a postwar 
region need to expect corruption and head it off.
 
✓ Manage expectations. Companies must have a reasonable plan for the 
project and commit to transparency over the course of the work.
Correcting Corporate Corruption
Human beings are greedy, and that greed can be institutionalized in different 
ways. For example, it can be institutionalized by socially responsible inves-
tors who want to find ways to make money while encouraging good in the 
world. Good can come from greed, but so can a heck of a lot of bad. Different 
countries have different attitudes about greed, including differences in the 
ways that governments handle corruption.
Corruption is defined as the misuse of public power for private benefit. It can 
include bribery, nepotism (hiring of relatives, even if they’re not qualified), 
and insider trading. Corruption undermines confidence in the government 
and the rule of law, causes money to be diverted away from economically 
viable projects, distorts the market, and cuts into profits.
 
To find out more about corruption, its many forms, and the governments and 
business sectors most likely to participate, go to the Web site of Transparency 
International, www.transparency.org. Each year, this organization pub-
lishes its Corruption Perception Index, which is a list of the countries consid-
ered to be the most corrupt. No nation wants to be at the bottom of that list! 
And that’s the organization’s point: The more that people pay attention to cor-
ruption, the less likely it is to take place.

163
 Chapter 9: The World around Us: Following International Affairs
Battling bribery
Want to get something done? For a fee, it can be taken care of. That’s bribery! 
It may be a fee to get something done within the law, like a product passed 
through customs in a reasonable amount of time, or the fee may be for 
something outside of the law, like to get around child labor or environmental 
protection laws.
Bribery can take more subtle forms. Does a senator want a donation to his 
political action committee in exchange for an earmark in the next federal 
budget? Would a potential customer be more amenable to signing a contract 
if his favorite charity received a large donation? Maybe that pesky accoun-
tant’s child needs a summer internship; can that be arranged?
The problem from an investor’s perspective is that bribery costs money that 
could be put to better use (including paying bigger returns to that investor), 
and it gives people unfair advantages that aren’t based on their ability to run 
their business or promote their brand.
 
What’s the difference between a bribe and a tip? To many people in the world, 
the idea that you should have to give extra money to your server after you pay 
your bill is tacky at best and bribery at worst. To an American server, it’s vital 
compensation that’s not covered by the tab or paid by the restaurant’s owner.
When developing policies for bribery, companies have to make sure they 
respect local customs for tips and gifts without crossing the line. It may be 
accepted etiquette to hold a lavish party with expensive presents for your 
importing partner; it’s probably not acceptable to give the prime minister’s 
brother-in-law a new Mercedes in exchange for helping you land a contract. 
One way to tell the difference between a bribe and a tip is whether the recipi-
ent would mind if everyone knew about the arrangement. Servers brag about 
the big tips they receive; would politicians?
Saying no to nepotism — most of the time
Nepotism, which is the hiring of relatives, isn’t necessarily bad. In many family 
businesses, the relatives will become the owners someday, so they need to 
master the ropes now. It can also help ensure a committed work force, because 
people may do better when they know their relatives are watching what goes 
on. But nepotism has problems, so investors should pay attention.
The big one is that the relative may not be qualified. If a company keeps 
hiring ne’er-do-wells whom no one else wants to hire, then its performance 
will suffer as the relative fails to deliver and as other employees come to 
resent the special treatment. Nepotism can also institutionalize discrimina-
tion by keeping the company from hiring workers of other ethnic or religious 

164
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
groups. Finally, it can be construed as a form of bribery, especially if a jobs-
for-contracts or “you hire my kid, I’ll hire yours” relationship is established.
 
You shouldn’t panic when you see nepotism, but you should ask tough ques-
tions about whether the practice is the best for the business.
Inside insider trading illegalities
Insider trading has a definition that only a lawyer could love. Insider trading 
involves making investment decisions on material, nonpublic information 
that would cause a reasonable person to change her investment opinion if 
she had that information. It often involves a misappropriation of information, 
ranging from an investment banker selling tips to buddies, a company execu-
tive sharing a bit of good news to help a favored politician make money, or 
managers looking to make a profit from a merger announcement before the 
news comes out.
Insider trading is illegal in the United States, and the U.S. government inves-
tigates suspected insider trading violations and punishes those found guilty. 
However, it’s not illegal everywhere, and the laws aren’t enforced everywhere 
that it’s illegal.
 
A key tenet of academic finance is the efficient markets hypothesis, which 
says that markets respond to all information about an investment. Under the 
strong form of market efficiency, even insider information is already included 
in prices. Is it fair that some people have access to information that others do 
not, or is it fair that that information is kept out of the market?
In general, the cost of capital tends to be lower where insider trading laws 
are enforced, so companies should want governments to enforce it. Investors 
should want laws enforced, too, so everyone is trading on the same informa-
tion. That may not be the case in every international market. Hence, you may 
not be playing on a level playing field when you invest in certain countries, 
which increases the risk of your investment.
Debating About Divestment
Divestment occurs when investors decide they can’t support the behavior in 
a country, so they pull out their investments. Divestment became a popular 
tactic of nonviolent resistance to the apartheid regime in South Africa prior 
to 1990, in which a minority of the population had rule over the majority, 
engaging in rampant economic and social discrimination. South Africa had a 
peaceful transition to majority rule and is now one of the most stable nations 
on the African continent. Because of divestment’s success in South Africa, it’s 
often recommended as a tactic for addressing other troubled places.

165
 Chapter 9: The World around Us: Following International Affairs
Related to divestment is a boycott, in which companies refuse to do business 
with certain countries or consumers refuse to buy products made by differ-
ent companies or in different places. The goal is the same: to create change 
by hitting businesses in the pocketbook and to force governments to make 
changes to maintain economic stability.
Divestment and boycotts are controversial, though. Is it better to stay engaged 
in an economy or to leave? That’s the key issue. Divestment is a signal that 
there’s a problem that needs to be addressed, but it doesn’t necessarily lead to 
change. It may leave the people in a region worse off while creating a challenge 
to the government. After all, some politicians view divestment as proof that 
they’re right and everyone else in the world is very, very wrong.
By staying in a country that has problems, active investment may lead to 
change. If a company makes it clear that it won’t discriminate, no matter 
what the law allows, then it may start to change practices in other busi-
nesses. But it can’t make changes if it doesn’t participate.
Finally, divestment and boycotts only work if they are coordinated and well-
publicized actions. One person’s decision is likely to be offset by someone 
else’s; only by working together can any change happen.
Green bananas
Chiquita Brands International is a prime exam-
ple of a multinational company that made big 
changes in its business practices — for the 
better. Chiquita became notorious for meddling 
in politics of the Central American countries 
where it grows its products. Its underhanded 
tricks in Guatemala in the 1950s and ’60s gave 
birth to the phrase banana republic. The brand 
was known for poor environmental policies, 
deplorable social policies, and overall lack of 
corporate responsibility. In the face of pressure 
from European consumers in the late 1990s, 
Chiquita was faced with a stark choice: change 
or wither away.
In a complete corporate turnaround, Chiquita 
embraced its critics head on and began a trans-
formation that has been both notable and prof-
itable. Chiquita countered the mostly accurate 
charges of poor environmental management 
practices by partnering with one of its fiercest 
critics, the Rainforest Alliance. The Rainforest 
Alliance now certifies all of Chiquita’s banana 
farms in Latin America for social and environ-
mental performance.
The company initiated a farm management 
program called the Better Banana Program 
and found that improved environmental man-
agement practices made the farms both more 
productive and more profitable. In the book 
Green to Gold, Daniel Esty and Andrew Winston 
report that Chiquita spent $20 million to roll out 
the Better Banana Program, but realized $100 
million in operating cost savings since it began 
participating, mostly due to decreased spend-
ing on pesticides.
In Colombia, 30 of Chiquita’s workers were 
killed between 1995 and 1998. To continue to do 
business in the country, Chiquita made illegal 
protection payments to Colombian paramilitary 
groups, financing their terrorist activities. In 
(continued)

Part II: Issues to Invest In 
keeping with its newfound commitment to cor-
porate responsibility, Chiquita owned up to the 
problem, disclosed the illegal payments to the 
U.S. Department of Justice in 2003, paid a $25 
million fine, and sold its Colombian operations.
Although Chiquita hasn’t always been the model 
multinational, its history shows the types of 
challenges that companies may face and how 
different activist and investor groups can hold 
companies accountable.

Keeping Your Faith: Investing 
with Religious Beliefs
In This Chapter
▶ Following religious principles when investing
▶ Seeing what different religions advocate
M
any people want to keep their investments consistent with their 
faith. Moreover, some religions require that they do so. In this chap-
ter, I outline some general guidelines for major (and some minor) religions, 
but remember that there are gray areas in every faith as well as plenty of 
practices that I don’t have room to cover. I offer no fatwa, no nil obstat, just 
general information to get you started on your quest. A Reform Jew and an 
Orthodox one may approach their investing differently, and a rank-and-file 
churchgoer may not care much about where investments are placed, but the 
board of a missionary society’s endowment does.
 
A fatwa is a ruling from an Islamic scholar on whether something fits Muslim 
law. A nil obstat is a ruling from a Catholic theologian that a work is free from 
doctrinal error.
Investing according to religious principles is a complicated subject, and exact 
interpretations may vary by denomination and congregation. My informa-
tion came from sources that I believe to be reliable, but your priest, rabbi, 
minister, imam, guru, or teacher may have a different take on the subject. 
If religion is important to your investing, talk to your own clergy to get the 
guidance that counts.
However, if you’re looking for a sense of how people from different religious 
backgrounds view money and investing, I can help you. That way, you can get 
started on your own quest, identify like-minded investors when forming activ-
ism campaigns, or understand the motivations of your friends and neighbors 
better.

Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Religion and Socially Responsible 
Investing
To many people, the only socially responsible investment is one that is com-
patible with their religious values. They aren’t going to worry about niceties 
of corporate governance or employee benefits when they have their souls on 
the line. The traditional interests of socially responsible investors, including 
human rights, the environment, and corporate responsibility, match those 
of some religious investors but not of others. Hence, a mutual fund that is 
labeled “socially responsible” may or may not work for you.
 
The key: Do your research. (Have I told you that already? If not, take a 
gander at Chapter 4.) Know what matters to you, and then look for investment 
opportunities that match.
Bringing Your Faith, or Someone Else’s 
Faith, to the Investment Table
Here’s the thing about religious beliefs: What seems normal to someone 
in the group may seem very strange to someone outside of it. (That’s why 
it’s called faith.) What difference does it make if you flip a light switch on 
Saturday, eat a hamburger on a Friday in March, or take out a loan rather 
than a lease? It makes a difference to someone, and maybe to you.
 
If your broker looks at you like you’re crazy when you bring up your religion 
relative to your investments, that’s a sign to start looking for a new broker. 
Likewise, if someone in your office complains about how the 401(k) choices 
contradict her faith, don’t laugh. Show her this book, help her understand the 
company’s issues under ERISA (explained in Chapter 3), and suggest that she 
recommend some new investment choices.
Examining Investment Practices 
of Different Faiths
What, exactly, do different religious groups believe about investing? There are 
many variations among religious investors, depending on the attitudes that 
a faith has about wealth and community responsibility. And, of course, many 
local religious communities may have their own interpretation of the larger 
faith’s guidelines. In alphabetical order, here’s a list of all the large and many of 
the smaller faiths, along with a look at their approach to money matters.

 Chapter 10: Keeping Your Faith: Investing with Religious Beliefs
Baha’i: Seeking global prosperity
The Baha’i faith is a new one, with approximately 5 million followers. It was 
started in 1863 when its prophet, a Persian prince named Baha’u’llah, taught 
that human society had finally matured enough to unite into a just, global 
society. Baha’is believe that global economic justice and prosperity will 
occur when everyone recognizes that the spiritual and the practical aspects 
of life are connected.
To abolish the extremes of poverty and wealth, people who own businesses 
should share their profits throughout the organization, so Baha’i investors look 
at how a company treats its workers and suppliers. Baha’is don’t drink alcohol 
or gamble, so investments in those industries are off limits to most followers.
Buddhism: Financial stability 
leads to happiness
Buddhism is an Asian religion. It was founded in India about 2,500 years 
ago by Guatama Buddha, a prince who became a great teacher when he dis-
covered the difference between his plush life and his subjects’ hard life. He 
renounced his worldly things and took up meditation in search of enlighten-
ment about why the world was the way it was. He even gave up food until he 
nearly died. After that, he decided that the ideal path through this world was 
a middle way, neither too soft nor too hard. He taught that through medita-
tion, people could overcome their greed and hatred to see the world as it 
was. (To find out more about Buddhism, read Buddhism For Dummies by 
Jonathan Landaw and Stephan Bodian [Wiley].)
The main precepts are dharma, which is the importance of right living, and 
karma, which is that all actions have a cause and an effect, even if it’s not 
obvious. Although some Buddhists renounce worldly goods, it’s not neces-
sary to do so in most traditions, as long as one isn’t too attached to them. In 
fact, Buddhism recognizes that some material stability is necessary for hap-
piness. Happiness can come from earning a just livelihood, not being in debt, 
and sharing wealth with others.
There is little in Buddhist texts that affects investment choices, but many 
who practice the religion are concerned about how their finances influence 
their dharma and karma. They often think about two other concepts, karuna, 
or nonviolence, and metta, or care of the world. Hence, many Buddhists 
refuse to invest in companies that make military equipment or process meat.
In 2008, the Dow Jones Dharma Indexes were developed to reflect the teach-
ings of Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, and Sikhism (I cover the latter three 
religions later in this chapter). The hope is that mutual funds, exchange-traded 
funds, and other products will be introduced to reflect the concept of dharma.

Christianity: Applying biblical 
teachings to investing
Christianity is the largest religion in the world and is one of three religions 
founded in the Middle East. It shares some texts with the other two, Judaism 
and Islam. Its main teaching is that God has three forms: God the father, 
his son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Through God, believers will be 
forgiven and achieve eternal salvation. Jesus Christ, a prophet who lived 
approximately 2,000 years ago, spoke against many of the laws that the Jews 
followed, and he promoted new laws emphasizing love, peace, and forgive-
ness. (If you want more specifics on this religion, check out Christianity For 
Dummies by Richard Wagner and Kurt Warner [Wiley].)
The teachings of Jesus, collected in the Gospels of the New Testament, are 
deeply ambivalent about money. Jesus says three times that “it is easier for 
a camel to enter the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom 
of heaven” (Matthew 19:23–24, Mark 10:24–25, and Luke 18:24–25). But Jesus 
never says it’s impossible for a wealthy person to enter into heaven, and 
Christians believe that all things are possible with God’s help.
That being said, there is no one “Christian” perspective on anything. 
Denominations have broken up over whether the pope has authority over all 
churches, and they’ve broken up over whether it’s appropriate to play music 
during worship services.
Few Christian denominations have explicit rules about investing, but many 
followers use their church’s teachings to help guide their decisions. Here’s an 
overview of some of the concerns that some of the major Christian denomi-
nations have about investing, arranged in chronological order of the group’s 
founding.
Roman Catholicism: Promoting equality and the value of human life
The Roman Catholic church is the oldest denomination, founded by Jesus’s 
disciple Peter. It remains the largest, although other Christian churches split 
off from it for all sorts of doctrinal and political reasons. The church has a 
centralized, hierarchical organization led by the pope and headquartered in 
Vatican City, an independent city-state in the middle of Rome, Italy. (To read 
more about this religion, check out Catholicism For Dummies by the Rev. John 
Trigilio Jr., PhD, and the Rev. Kenneth Brighenti, PhD [Wiley].)
The church’s main teachings are based on the Bible, the main Christian text, 
and found in the catechism, a list of major beliefs and sins affecting all parts 
of life. Only a few financial practices are explicitly listed as wrong; these 
include committing fraud and encouraging others to do so; speculation and 
market manipulation that cause one person to make money at the expense of 
others; tax evasion; and forgery of checks and invoices.

 Chapter 10: Keeping Your Faith: Investing with Religious Beliefs
The Catholic church teaches that social and economic inequality can 
threaten peace and cause wars, so anything that exacerbates that inequal-
ity is a sin. Another teaching is that human life is the most important value 
in society, so anything that leads to abortion or unnecessary war is a sin. 
Hence, Catholic investors are often reluctant to be involved with defense con-
tractors or with healthcare companies that make products used in abortion.
Because many institutions affiliated with the Roman Catholic church have 
significant funds to invest, Catholic church groups are known as aggres-
sive activist investors. They use shareholder resolutions, proxy votes, and 
meetings with management (see Chapter 5 for more on these) to press for 
changes in corporate practices that can lead to greater social and economic 
justice. How significant are those funds? The University of Notre Dame had 
an endowment of $5.9 billion as of June 2007, making it the 14th largest uni-
versity endowment in the United States and the largest endowment of any 
American university with an active religious affiliation. Add to that the money 
from other Catholic universities, charitable foundations, hospitals, and pen-
sion funds for employees, priests, and nuns, and you have a force for social 
change through investing.
Traditional Protestantism: Succeeding through hard work and thrift
The oldest Protestant churches, including the Congregational, Episcopal, 
Lutheran, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches, believe in the importance 
of individual conscience and the guidance of the Bible rather than dictates 
from a central church leader. They also have a cultural belief in hard work 
and thrift to show that they’re good Christians.
No surprise, hard work and thrift usually lead to financial success. The Puritans, 
Congregationalist Protestants who were among the first European settlers in the 
United States, may have set the tone for those who came before and after, no 
matter what their religion; many historians believe that much of the economic 
success of the United States is because of the so-called Protestant work ethic.
Matters of dictate and matters of conscience
Some religious groups set forth precise rules 
that adherents must follow to remain in good 
standing. These are matters of dictate. It’s not 
important what the rules are or how they seem 
to outsiders, only that people who are in the 
practice must follow them.
Matters of conscience are guidelines that fol-
lowers of a faith don’t necessarily have to meet; 
they may involve matters that the texts and 
traditions of a congregation don’t address or 
that can be argued many different ways.
Most religions have matters of dictate and 
matters of conscience, and investing often 
falls under conscience. Hence, Catholicism’s 
Jesuit Order of priests may choose not to invest 
money of affiliated organizations in the stocks 
of defense contractors, but there is no rule that 
says Roman Catholics commit sin if they do so.

172
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Hard work aside, Protestant churches themselves tend to be neutral on the 
issue of social investing. Many liberal Protestants avoid investing in defense 
companies or those with poor records of worker treatment; many conserva-
tive Protestants avoid investing in companies that produce items used in 
abortion or that sell pornography. Protestant institutions are often activist 
investors, using the value of their investments to promote social justice and 
other values of their faith. They often join with investors from other religious 
institutions to get companies to listen.
Evangelical and Fundamentalist churches: Investing based on beliefs
Evangelicals and Fundamentalist Christians tend to believe in the literal 
interpretation of the Bible and the importance of demonstrating their 
beliefs to others. Both movements are associated with American interpreta-
tions of Protestantism and tend to have a conservative view of the world. 
Evangelicals believe that each person must have a personal religious con-
version (known as being born again); Fundamentalists often believe in pre-
destination, or the idea that God has already determined who will achieve 
salvation.
 
Although they’re often lumped together, Evangelicals and Fundamentalists 
are very different. Evangelicals believe in going out into the world to convert 
people. They tend to be conservative about matters of doctrine, although not 
all Evangelicals are conservative. Fundamentalists are extremely conservative 
about doctrine, and they sometimes avoid outsiders for fear that they’ll be led 
into sin by the temptations of the wider world.
There are many different church groups associated with Evangelical and 
Fundamentalist traditions. Although few set out specific investing guidelines, 
many followers believe that to live their religious commitment and be free 
of corrupting influences, they should only invest in companies aligned with 
their beliefs. Hence, many don’t invest in businesses associated with abor-
tion, alcohol, gambling, or pornography.
Mormons: Financial security is a priority
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, whose members are often 
referred to as Mormons, holds that the original teachings of Christianity 
became corrupted over time. Their main text, the Book of Mormon, is a com-
panion to the Bible, and Mormons believe that it restores the teachings of 
Jesus Christ to their correct form. (For more details on this religion, pick up 
a copy of Mormonism For Dummies by Jana Riess and Christopher Kimball 
Bigelow [Wiley].)
The Latter-day Saints church teaches that members have a responsibility to 
provide financial security for their families; without it, the household can’t 
achieve peace and harmony. Members should strive to be self-reliant 

173
 Chapter 10: Keeping Your Faith: Investing with Religious Beliefs
financially. After paying off debts, the church recommends that families build 
a financial reserve. After that is met, members should save money for long-
term needs, including retirement and education. Many members also save to 
cover the costs of missionary service for themselves or relatives. The church 
isn’t concerned with the specifics of the members’ investment choices, as 
long as those investments are prudent and help the investor become more 
self-reliant. Many church members have the same considerations for specific 
investments as other conservative Christians: No sin stocks!
Hinduism: Advancing peace 
and the good of the world
Hinduism is the world’s oldest established religion. It’s ranked third globally 
in numbers of adherents, and it is practiced almost exclusively in India or by 
people of Indian descent who live in other countries.
 
Some readers may be thinking, hey! Atheism is third! Indeed, most surveys 
of world religion show that more people have no religion than are Hindu. 
However, this is a chapter about religion. An atheist won’t find much guidance 
here but will find in Chapters 7, 8, 9, and 11 ideas about other values-based 
ways to invest.
The Hindu religion is very different from most others because it’s not based 
on a specific text or a specific interpretation of God. Instead, it has a wide 
collection of texts accumulated over millennia as well as a pantheon of gods. 
Some Hindus worship only one; others worship several, and a few worship 
none at all. The common belief, instead, is that the soul, called atman, is eter-
nal and will be reborn. One’s form in the next life depends on karma, influ-
enced by one’s behavior in this life.
Because Hinduism has so many texts and traditions to draw on, a believer 
looking for guidance on investing will be overwhelmed. Attitudes toward 
money are shaped by specific congregations and family traditions. For many, 
two key Hindu concepts influence their investment choices:
 
✓ Ahimsa, the Sanskrit word for nonviolence, prohibits anything that 
harms a living soul, and because souls are reincarnated, an animal soul 
is the same as a human one. That means that businesses that process or 
sell meat are prohibited as well as those that make weapons.
 
✓ Under loka-samgraha, a Sanskrit term meaning “the good of the world,” 
investments should make the world a better place and be rooted in 
sustainable economic development rather than greed.

Islam: Money matters are well defined
Islam is the second largest religion in the world; the number of members is 
growing faster than Christianity, so it may soon be the largest. The religion 
shares roots with Judaism and Christianity. Islam’s prophet, Muhammad, 
wrote the Koran, the religion’s main text, about 1,400 years ago. Followers 
of Islam, known as Muslims, believe that Christians and Jews deviated from 
God; the Koran restores his teachings. (Islam For Dummies by Malcolm Clark 
[Wiley] has more details about this faith.)
Muslims believe that the desperations of poverty can force people to stop 
believing in God. Therefore, it’s all right to have material wealth, but Muslims 
have an obligation to give money to charity.
Islamic law, known as Shariah, has strict guidelines for financial matters. 
Muslims may not pay or receive interest, known as riba. Philosophically, a 
believer should be a partner in the business and thus take on risk; in a tradi-
tional loan, the lender receives regular interest and can claim collateral if the 
borrower doesn’t repay.
To a Muslim, that is an uneven relationship. Instead of borrowing money 
or buying bonds, Muslims use other forms of financing, including cost-plus 
arrangements, in which someone buys an item for you at one price and resells 
it to you at a higher price later; lease-to-own arrangements; and joint owner-
ship and shared profits. If the borrower is unable to pay, the arrangement 
must be forgiven to stop the cycle of borrowing and refinancing that can 
leave people deeply in debt.
Muslims can and do own stock, but they can’t invest in companies involved 
with alcohol, gambling, pork processing, pornography, or tobacco. And, 
because they can’t charge or receive interest, they can’t invest in traditional 
banks. Several banks in the Middle East operate entirely under Shariah, and 
more institutions in Europe and the United States are developing business 
lines to accommodate the needs of their Muslim clients.
Many Muslim scholars will grant exceptions to Shariah out of necessity. If a 
Muslim wants to buy a house in a place where no Islamic financing arrange-
ment is available, he would probably be allowed to use a traditional mort-
gage. But if you happen to be a Muslim in this situation, don’t take my word 
for it. Find a scholar or imam, because his definition of necessity might be dif-
ferent from yours.
 
In situations where Muslims find themselves using prohibited financial 
arrangements because there are no alternatives, they may be required to 
purify any profits by giving a share to charity.

175
 Chapter 10: Keeping Your Faith: Investing with Religious Beliefs
Jainism: Building wealth through savings
The Jain religion emerged from Hinduism more than 2,000 years ago. Jains 
believe that they can stop the otherwise endless cycle of the suffering and 
rebirth of their soul by living a strict and Spartan life. In that way, their souls 
will finally have God-consciousness. They emphasize ahimsa, or nonviolence 
in relations with all creatures.
Jains are allowed to accumulate wealth, and many do because their lifestyle 
encourages hard work and discourages spending. They tend to support 
educational and religious charities. When Jains invest, they’re very careful 
not to support any businesses that engage in violence against the world, 
similar to Buddhists, Hindus, and Sikhs (I cover these religions elsewhere in 
this chapter).
Juche: Investing is unnecessary
Never heard of Juche? Neither had I until I started researching this chapter! 
Juche is a spiritual belief system practiced in North Korea. It emphasizes 
self-reliance and obedience to the nation’s leader. Because North Korea has a 
Communist economic system, people who practice Juche don’t invest.
Judaism: Accumulating wealth 
and sharing it with the poor
To be a good Jew, one must be able to read and write. When a child comes 
of age in a ceremony known as the bar mitzvah (for boys) or the bat mitzvah 
(for girls), the honoree must read to the congregation from the Torah, which 
is a key Jewish text. Because of the emphasis on education, Jewish people 
have often been successful in business and professional life. (Some people 
have used this success to argue that the Jews must be doing something far 
more sinister than going to school and working hard.)
A key component of Jewish belief is tzedakah, which is similar to charity. 
Jews are expected to share 10 percent of their wealth with the poor, even if 
they are impoverished themselves. The money doesn’t have to go to a syna-
gogue or Jewish charity; educational and healthcare institutions are also 
acceptable recipients of tzedakah. The highest degree of tzedakah involves 
giving money to make someone else self-reliant, which may include invest-
ing in his business. (Microfinance, which involves lending small amounts of 
money to small-business people in impoverished countries and is discussed 
in Chapter 17, is a perfect example.)

176
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Jewish law, known as halacha, covers all aspects of life for Orthodox believ-
ers. It recognizes that humans have a natural desire to make money and accu-
mulate wealth. Therefore, money is not sinful; instead, it’s important that it 
be earned ethically and that tzedakah be maintained, no matter how much or 
how little money one has.
There are exceptions to halacha. Certain laws should apply to everyone in all 
circumstances regardless of religion, such as prohibitions on fraud. Other rules, 
such as the kosher rules affecting how animals are slaughtered and food is 
prepared, apply only to Jews. Therefore, it’s acceptable for a Jewish person to 
invest in a company that is open for business on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, 
or that produces non-kosher food, as long as he isn’t a majority shareholder.
Like most religions, Judaism is split into different denominations that have 
different interpretations of halacha. Some, especially Reform Jews, adhere 
to the ethical components but don’t observe the rules about diet, dress, or 
Sabbath behavior. (For a more comprehensive explanation of the Jewish reli-
gion, read Judaism For Dummies by Ted Falcon and David Blatner [Wiley].)
Shinto: Focusing on the environment
Shinto is a native Japanese religion heavily influenced by Buddhism (see the 
earlier section for more on this religion). Believers worship the spirits of 
places in their country as well as natural features themselves, such as Mount 
Fuji. Historically, the nation’s emperor was also worshipped as a god, a prac-
tice that ended after World War II. Adherents believe that nature is sacred, so 
it should be loved and celebrated.
Rather than participate in specialized rituals once a week, Shinto practitio-
ners believe in formal rituals of respect and appreciation throughout the day. 
Hence, it’s the source of the strict etiquette practiced in Japan. The religion 
has little to say about investing, but someone who practices strict Shinto 
invests in companies that protect the environment.
Sikhism: Acquiring wealth is discouraged
The Sikh religion developed out of Hinduism about 500 years ago. The follow-
ers believe in one God, the creator of all living beings. Members see them-
selves as soldiers for God, charged with defending their faith and providing 
service to all. The military influence means that Sikhs seem to be in uniform. 
Sikh men and women cover their hair, which they don’t cut. Sikh men don’t 
cut their beards, either. Baptized Sikhs wear a small sword called a kirpan 
under their clothes, but the religion teaches nonviolence, using the same 
Sanskrit word, ahimsa, as do Hindus and Jains (see the earlier sections for 
more on these religions).

177
 Chapter 10: Keeping Your Faith: Investing with Religious Beliefs
Sikhs aren’t encouraged to acquire material wealth, and they may not drink 
or smoke. When investing, Sikhs avoid alcohol and tobacco companies as 
well as military ventures.
Unitarian Universalism: Practicing 
social and economic justice
Unitarian Universalism is a religion formed in the United States in the 20th 
century, although it traces some of its beliefs back to the 18th century. It’s 
based on Jewish and Christian teachings about treating one’s neighbors 
with love and respect, but it doesn’t have a formal creed or set of beliefs. 
Unitarian Universalists believe strongly in social and economic justice 
throughout the world. As an organization, the church supports sustainable 
and community investing; many church members do, too.
Wicca: Respect is fundamental
Wicca is the modern-day version of traditional Northern European pagan reli-
gions. Followers call themselves pagans, witches, or Wiccans. Wiccans wor-
ship a male God and a female Goddess who manifest themselves throughout 
nature. The basic credo is “Do as ye will, as long as ye harm none.” Members 
accept a variety of different lifestyles and approaches to the world as long as 
respect for other people and nature is maintained. Wiccans also believe that 
whatever they do will come back to them threefold, whether good or bad. 
Many of the religion’s rituals are secret, known only to initiates. Initiates also 
perform spells, which are incantations and rituals designed to bring about 
change; some are for abundance and wealth.
A Wiccan looks for investments that are friendly toward the environment, 
promote peace, and protect the rights of other people.

Chapter 11
Social Change and the 
Responsible Corporation
In This Chapter
▶ The best practices of the best businesses
▶ Happy workers are productive workers
▶ Making the workers into owners
M
any social investors want the businesses they invest in to behave 
responsibly. Investors expect the company to sell its product or 
service fairly and accurately, and they want the company to respect every 
person who gets that product to market, including vendors, customers, and 
employees. Few companies get it right. Those that do are often rewarded 
with happy customers, loyal employees, and rich profits.
Those who want to earn profits are often caricatured as heartless, greedy 
folks. Think Ebenezer Scrooge, the character in Charles Dickens’s classic 
story A Christmas Carol. Scrooge’s love of money causes him to lose the 
people he loves. No matter how much socially successful businesses want 
to generate big bucks, they know that if they don’t provide value or promote 
societal values, customers and employees will go elsewhere.
Forward-thinking businesses are experimenting with new ways to conduct 
their basic operations and change the world in the process. In some cases, 
that means better products. In others, it means revamping the way the corpo-
ration operates. This chapter covers the ways that corporations make money 
and how they improve relationships with customers, suppliers, government 
regulators, and employees. It includes information on employee ownership, 
which may be helpful if your investment portfolio includes shares in the 
company that employs you. However, it doesn’t include information on envi-
ronmental issues (covered in Chapter 8) or international concerns (covered 
in Chapter 9).

180
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Running a Business to Get 
its Relationships Right
Every day companies enter into relationships with others. A company must 
interact with the companies that supply it with inventory and other goods 
and services needed to make the business run; with its customers, who keep 
it in business; and with the regulators who ensure that the company follows 
applicable laws. (Employees are another key group — so key that they get 
their very own section later in the chapter.)
Companies can choose policies that are good for everyone involved, or they 
can choose policies that make the company better off while making everyone 
else worse off. If you care about how companies that you invest in do busi-
ness, you need to pay attention to these areas.
Building good supplier relationships
A company is in business to make a profit, to be sure, but it’s not right to 
deprive suppliers of a profit, either. For a company to do well over the long 
haul, it has to have happy suppliers that are willing to work with it. Chiseling 
on price, sitting on invoices, and demanding unrealistic levels of service 
from suppliers may help a company generate profits in the short run, but it 
will hurt in the long run when the suppliers go out of business or move on to 
better customers. Good supplier relationships tend to be collaborative, with 
the suppliers helping the customer and the customer paying the supplier for 
the value added.
Likewise, it’s important for companies to keep an eye on suppliers. More than 
one salesperson has been so desperate to write an order that he offers kick-
backs, bribes, or other enticements. Companies work to manage their sup-
plier relations so everyone behaves appropriately.
Some companies go so far as to draw up a code of conduct for prospective 
suppliers, setting out how they expect suppliers to behave when calling on 
them, and setting forth environmental, labor, quality, and financial standards 
that they expect their suppliers to meet. These standards may be backed up 
with a certification program or audits that the supplier must pass if it wants 
to keep the contract.
 
Many companies send key functions in their business to outside contractors 
to save money or get access to people with greater skills than they can afford 
to hire full time. It’s usually good business for both the company and the out-
sourced service provider; it can be terrible if it’s a way for the company to 
push its responsibilities onto someone else.

181
 Chapter 11: Social Change and the Responsible Corporation
Promoting good customer relations
Businesses have to have customers. Some companies sell mostly to other 
businesses (known as the business-to-business market, sometimes shortened 
as B2B), while others sell to individual consumers, and still others sell 
to both.
These different sets of customers have different sets of expectations. For 
example, a company selling to another business may have to go through a 
certification program or agree to honor certain marketing practices (see the 
preceding section). It’s highly unlikely that any company would agree to go 
through a certification process at the request of an individual, but you as an 
individual customer can do the research to decide if a company deserves 
your business, just as you can do the research as an individual investor to 
decide if a company deserves your investment.
But certification process or not, companies are expected to treat customers 
well. After all, the customer is the source of revenue. Things are going to go 
wrong, but a company that can accept responsibility for its problems is a 
more responsible business overall. A responsible company will stand behind 
its products and address customer complaints promptly and politely. It will 
want to keep customers happy so they turn into repeat customers.
 
Any company in any industry will run into occasional problems. Investors 
should not view a problem as a sign that a company isn’t responsible; instead, 
they should watch to see how the problem is handled and whether it was an 
unusual event or an indicator of loose tactics.
In 1982, seven people died when they took Tylenol, a pain reliever, which 
had been tainted with cyanide. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), the company 
that makes Tylenol, was not at fault, but the company immediately pulled the 
drug off the shelves everywhere. The company’s managers knew that cus-
tomers were frightened and that it was pointless to tell them that someone 
else was responsible. The recall generated tremendous goodwill for Johnson 
& Johnson, because customers and investors felt that they could trust the 
company to do right by them.
 
Beware the fallacy of the anecdote. No company will satisfy 100 percent of its 
customers, and the cranky ones complain the most. When assessing a com-
pany on its responsibility toward customers, look for overall trends rather 
than a single complaint, even if the complaint is legitimate and even if it was 
made by your best friend. On the other hand, your buddy may be in love with 
a business that has managed to disappoint every other customer it has.

182
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Maintaining government relations
Every business faces an army of regulators, whether local, state, or federal. 
There are taxes to pay, licenses to hold, and rules to follow covering every-
thing from the sizes of entryways to the management of retirement plans. 
Like them or not (and most businesspeople don’t), regulations are a fact of 
doing business.
The responsible way to approach government regulations is to follow them. 
The irresponsible way is to ignore regulations as long as possible and then 
try to bribe one’s way out of them. (Hey, I live in Chicago. Don’t tell me it 
doesn’t happen.) And then there’s an entire range of approaches in between, 
from aggressive lobbying of elected officials in the hope of receiving more 
favorable regulations to ignoring the regulation until someone comes around 
to enforce it.
 
You can find out which candidates get the most money from different cor-
porations and their employees by searching at www.opensecrets.org. It 
includes data on political action committees (PACs), which are fundraising 
organizations that allow people to raise money for a cause rather than a candi-
date; PACs can accept larger donations than candidates can.
Establishing Ideal Employee Conditions
Employees who are treated well are most likely going to do a good job for 
shareholders. Employees have friends and family; their experiences on the 
job are part of the company’s public face. And work conditions are highly 
regulated, so an employer that wants to run a legal operation has to comply 
with regulations that affect wages, hours, and working conditions. Companies 
that are known for being good places to work have an easier time attracting 
smart, hardworking staff members.
 
The law is the law. Just because an employee agrees to wage or hour condi-
tions that are different from what the law requires doesn’t mean a company 
can get away with it.
Obviously, this doesn’t mean that employees can do whatever they want. 
Some people aren’t a right fit for the job they are in. However, it’s possible to 
treat people humanely even when disciplining or firing them. (Here’s a hint: 
Firing someone by voice mail or e-mail is a bad idea.)
The following sections cover some key employee issues that may interest 
social investors, such as discrimination, benefits, wages, and working condi-
tions. Most managers want to believe that they are great bosses, so it can be 
difficult to get good information about what it’s like to work at a company 
from the company itself. Difficult, but not impossible.

183
 Chapter 11: Social Change and the Responsible Corporation
Statistics on employee turnover are usually published in a company’s annual 
report on Form 10K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and 
made available to investors. A quick Internet news search can often turn up 
interesting stories, good and bad.
Discouraging discrimination
Most forms of discrimination are illegal. Employers can’t favor workers based 
on race, religion, age, gender, or physical status. And yet, employment dis-
crimination takes place every single day and in far too many workplaces. It 
goes without saying that it’s a bad thing. A company that discriminates isn’t 
going to be able to hire the best person for the job. It’s not going to be in 
touch with a large slice of its potential customers. And it may end up spend-
ing too much time defending its practices rather than running its businesses.
Although discrimination goes on, it’s difficult for investors to identify which 
companies are the biggest offenders unless there has been a major public 
lawsuit or related action. It’s easy to find companies that have a good reputa-
tion, though, because many business publications prepare annual rankings 
of the best places overall to work, as well as lists of the best companies for 
minorities, women, and people with physical disabilities.
Domestic partner benefits
In the United States, people under the age of 
65 usually get healthcare coverage for them-
selves and their families through their employ-
ers. (People over age 65 can join a single-payer 
national healthcare program called Medicare.) 
Many people, especially gay couples, are in 
family relationships that aren’t legally recog-
nized, effectively limiting their health insur-
ance options. To take care of this inequality, 
many employers allow their employees to buy 
health insurance for people with whom they 
live, even if they aren’t married. Some may limit 
this to same-sex couples where marriage is not 
an option; in cities and states that allow some 
form of marriage or civil union for gay couples, 
employers may limit domestic partner benefits 
to people who make that commitment.
There’s one big problem: Under federal law, 
employee benefits for heterosexual married 
couples and their children are deductible from 
income taxes, but benefits for others are tax-
able as income to the employee. That makes 
domestic partner benefits very expensive. Still, 
in a nation where about 50 million people have 
no health insurance, it’s better than nothing.
Most social investors think that domestic part-
ner benefits are good because they help com-
panies attract and retain good workers, while 
also doing something important — reducing 
the number of people without health insurance. 
A handful of investors have problems with it, 
especially if their investing style is guided by 
their religious beliefs and their religion con-
demns homosexuality.

184
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Offering employee benefits equally
Pity the poor HR manager. She wants to provide benefits that keep most 
employees happy within a tight budget, knowing that it will make some share-
holders unhappy. Allow some employees to buy health benefits for domestic 
partners? Some shareholders will cheer the firm for being so supportive; 
others will decry the firm for its lack of morals.
Few employee benefits are mandated by law; the laws usually require only 
that any benefits that are made available be made available on fair terms. For 
example, no employer has to offer health insurance, but companies that do 
face extensive regulation about the ways in which those plans are operated.
One problem that some companies encounter is the trade-off between quality 
and affordability. Most companies have an enormous range of employee com-
pensation. Entry-level employees may make minimum wage while executive 
officers have millions. Still, most benefit plans have to apply to all employees. 
The shop clerk may want health insurance but may not be able to afford the 
plan with all the bells and whistles that the CEO wants.
At a minimum, companies should provide all employees with sick leave 
and access to health insurance and retirement plans. It is hoped that most 
employees would be able to participate in both. Other benefits that can help 
attract and retain great employees include vacation leave, tuition reimburse-
ment, child-care reimbursement, and extended family leave.
Fair wages and work conditions
A major concern for social investors is how companies treat their employees. 
Now, you probably have a decent job with an employer that has to compete 
for workers, so your company treats you and your co-workers in a reason-
ably humane manner. Thus, it’s easy to forget that the annals of labor law 
are filled with suits filed by employees working for people who would deny 
them access to a restroom. (In 1998, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration issued a requirement that employers make restrooms avail-
able to all employees to use as needed. Before then, believe it or not, there 
was no recognized right to use the bathroom during the workday.)
Yes, even in the United States, even today, some employers treat their work-
ers terribly. If you care about how a company that you invest in treats its 
employees, you’ll want to spend some time researching news stories about 
employee work conditions and wages. Problems with pay are usually related 
to discrimination, so your findings may uncover other issues that will affect 
your investment decisions.

185
 Chapter 11: Social Change and the Responsible Corporation
Only a small percentage of private sector employees belong to labor unions. 
Unions came into being when manufacturing employees were treated 
horribly — in some cases, barely better than slaves. But in the almost two 
centuries since the first union was established, state and federal regulations 
have forced companies to improve working conditions, and most employers 
realized that an employee who was paid fairly and had enough time to eat 
lunch and use the bathroom would be a better worker than one who didn’t 
have those basics.
Still, many employees have used unions to achieve improved working condi-
tions and better pay, and the threat of unionization has forced many com-
panies to keep workers happy. In general, a labor problem (which is not the 
same as having a unionized workforce) is really a management problem. If 
managers aren’t taking care of the people who work for them, whether or not 
they belong to a union, then the company has a lot of other problems.
 
Many social investors prefer to see companies that have labor unions. Some 
companies don’t have unions because management has thwarted them. 
However, many companies don’t have unions because the employees are 
treated fairly in the first place.
Sharing the Wealth with Employees
Many companies encourage their employees to work for shareholders by 
turning employees into owners themselves. Employees who own company 
stock become shareholders; what is in the shareholder’s best interest is in 
their best interest, too. When employees hold company stock, it reduces 
the principal-agent problem (discussed in Chapter 2) and distributes wealth 
throughout the organization. Their ownership status reduces employees’ 
resentment against overpaid CEOs or greedy shareholders, and it may lead to 
new ideas as employees think more like owners and see how they can profit 
personally from better sales or lower expenses. For many companies, it’s a 
responsible way to reward everyone who works for the company.
 
Whether you’re an employer thinking of creating ownership benefits for 
employees, an employee who has shares or options in employer stock, or an 
investor who wants to know more about these benefits, a great resource is the 
National Center for Employee Ownership, www.nceo.org.
Employees can be owners of public and private companies.
 
✓ With public companies, the value of the employee’s stock and options is 
set by the investors participating in the stock market.

186
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
 
✓ Private companies key the value of stock and options off of other metrics:
 
• It may use the company’s earnings multiplied by the average price/
earnings ratios of public companies in the same industry.
 
• It may be based on the company’s book value.
 
• It could be tied to some other value.
 
 Whatever the company uses, it should be an objective measure that is 
applied consistently from year to year.
Some of these plans are governed by ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974, which I cover in great detail in Chapter 3. So ownership 
plans must be managed for the benefit of the employees, not the sharehold-
ers of the offering company.
Simple and direct ownership
Although the very idea of employee stock options seems to grab people’s 
imaginations, even a decade or so after the initial Internet craze, companies 
offer employees other ways to own company stock. Many offer actual shares 
that affect the employee’s net worth today. In many cases, companies allow 
employees to buy stock at a discount, which makes ownership even more 
attractive.
Employee stock purchase plans
An employee stock purchase plan, sometimes called a 423 plan because of the 
piece of the tax code that permits it, lets employees buy company stock out 
of their paychecks. The purchase price is usually a 15 percent discount to the 
market price, so it’s possible for an employee to buy it through the company 
and sell it immediately for a quick profit. Usually, companies allow employees 
with at least two years of service to participate.
Restricted stock purchase plans
Under a restricted stock purchase plan, only certain employees can buy shares 
through the program. These are most common in private companies, where 
people are allowed to buy stock in the firm when they are promoted to a 
certain level because they’re considered to have influence in the company’s 
success. (In fact, they may be required to buy stock in order to accept the pro-
motion, a typical arrangement in many legal and accounting partnerships.)
In some cases, restricted plans are stock grants made based on performance 
or seniority. For example, some companies have a policy of granting shares 
of stock when employees hit milestone anniversaries, say of 10 or 20 years of 
service. Employees who receive these grants have to pay tax on the gains as 
though they were income.

187
 Chapter 11: Social Change and the Responsible Corporation
If the company is private, the employee will probably be required to sell the 
stock back to the company either upon the employer’s demand or upon ter-
mination. (The employer may demand it if, say, a merger is being negotiated 
and the buyer wants to deal with one seller rather than all the employee-
owners individually.) The employer doesn’t always have to pay a lump sum 
of money for these shares; in some cases, the employer will issue a note and 
pay the selling employee back over several years. The specific terms will be 
set out in the agreement that accompanied the share offering. Employees 
may want to have a lawyer review the terms before committing the cash.
401(k) plans
A 401(k) plan, named for the section of the law that permits it, is a type 
of retirement savings plan that allows employees to set aside part of their 
income before taxes. The employer often matches part of the employee’s 
contribution, sometimes in cash and sometimes in company stock. The 
employee’s contribution usually can be invested in different types of invest-
ments, such as a range of mutual funds; sometimes company stock is one of 
the alternatives. This means that with a 401(k) plan, employees can accumu-
late company stock at low prices and with pretax dollars.
 
Companies like it when employees buy company stock in the 401(k) plan 
because it costs them less money than if the employees elect to put it into 
mutual funds. The problem is that if the company goes under, employees can 
lose their jobs and their retirement savings. Ouch! Company stock should 
never be your only investment. You can show your employer how loyal you 
are by doing a good job. Don’t try to show loyalty by taking huge risks with 
your financial security.
Employee stock ownership plans
An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP, pronounced eee-sop) is a type of 
tax-advantaged retirement plan that invests directly in the employer’s com-
pany stock. ESOPs are often set up to acquire all or part of the company’s 
shares from the current owner. This could be to prevent a hostile takeover, 
to spin a division out from a larger company, or to help an entrepreneur 
sell his company to people who understand it. The key difference between 
an ESOP and other ways that employees can buy stock is that an ESOP can 
borrow money to buy the stock that will be distributed to employees. Then 
the company makes a tax-deductible contribution toward employee retire-
ment benefit to the ESOP each year. The ESOP uses the money to pay down 
the loan used to acquire the shares.
Now, if you have a sharp eye for tax matters, you may have noticed that ESOPs 
carry a host of tax advantages. The interest paid on the loan is deductible 
from income taxes as an operating expense of the business (just as almost all 
interest is for almost all businesses). The employer’s contribution used to pay 

188
Part II: Issues to Invest In 
down the loan is also deductible from taxes (as almost all retirement plan con-
tributions are). And the employee doesn’t have to pay taxes on the stock until 
retirement and possibly not even then, depending on her financial position 
when that day comes.
Stock options
An option is a contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, 
to buy an asset in the future at a price determined today. The price where the 
option can be exercised is known as the strike price. With a stock option, an 
employee can pay a premium of $5 today for the right to buy a share of stock 
at $20 six months from now. If the stock price in six months is more than $20, 
then the option can be exercised and is said to be “in the money.” If the price 
is more than $25, then it makes sense for the option holder to exercise it.
For example, if the stock price were $31, the holder would be able to buy 
the stock at $20 per share. Because he is already out the $5 option price, 
the profit would be $31 – $20 – $5 = $6. If the stock stays less than $20 in six 
months, the option holder loses only the $5 premium.
What makes the stock price go up? Under normal market conditions, good 
corporate performance leads to a higher stock price, and the collective 
strong effort of managers and employees can generate that good corporate 
performance. Employees like options because they represent extra compen-
sation, and the employees don’t have to pay tax on them until they sell the 
stock, which they received when they exercised the option. Companies like 
them because the options are cheaper than other forms of compensation and 
they help employees think like the shareholders whom they work for.
Employee option purchase plans
Just as with the employee stock purchase plan described earlier, an employee 
option purchase plan allows employees to buy stock options out of their pay-
checks. These plans give the employees the right to acquire stock in the future 
at a price that’s determined now, which can be no less than 85 percent of the 
stock’s current market price. Employees don’t pay tax until they sell the stock 
that they acquired when they exercised the option. Employee option purchase 
plans are broad-based, meaning that they are open to just about everyone at 
the company, instead of distributed as a bonus.
Incentive stock options
Incentive stock options are designed to encourage employees to do a good 
job and help the company grow, and they’re regulated by section 424(c) of 
the tax code. Hence, they are a very specific type of option with very specific 
regulations.

189
 Chapter 11: Social Change and the Responsible Corporation
These plans must be approved by shareholders, and they don’t have to apply 
to all employees; in practice, most incentive stock option plans are limited to 
senior executives. Employees given incentive stock options have to exercise 
the stock while they work at the company or within three months of leaving. 
Some companies will even lend employees the money they need to exercise 
the options. (Although strangely enough, based on many proxies that I have 
read, it seems like the employees who are in most of need of the extra cash 
are the most highly paid executives. Go figure.)
 
In some cases, exercising incentive stock options will trigger a liability under 
the alternative minimum tax, which is higher than ordinary tax rates. Many an 
employee at a formerly high-flying company has been stuck with a huge tax 
bill on now-worthless stock. If you have significant incentive stock options, 
you probably need an experienced tax accountant to help you.
Nonqualified options
Unlike incentive stock options, nonqualified options aren’t qualified to receive 
special tax treatment — hence, the name. They are popular as a way to give 
incentive options to a broad group of employees.
In most cases, employees don’t pay any tax when they receive the option. 
Instead, the difference between the value of the stock when the option is 
exercised and the price of the option (often zero) is taxed as ordinary income 
earned at the time of exercise, with the tax due that year. If the stock is held 
after it is exercised, the difference between the sale price and the value of the 
stock at the time of exercise is taxed as a capital gain.
Stock appreciation rights and phantom stock
Some private companies don’t have stock to give. Other companies want to 
create rewards based on the performance of its divisions relative to their 
competitors, rather than on the performance of the company as a whole. 
They can do this by creating stock appreciation rights, which reward employ-
ees for an increase in company value without giving them a stake in the com-
pany itself, or with phantom stock, which is an artificial security based on the 
value of a company or division. Employees pay tax on ordinary income calcu-
lated on the cash they receive when the rights are exercised or the phantom 
stock is sold.

Part II: Issues to Invest In 
Ways to invest for social change
Investors who care about the relationship that a 
company has with all of its stakeholders will find 
attractive investments in just about any indus-
try. However, a few sectors are more likely to 
have responsible relationships with customers, 
vendors, and employees.
 ✓ High technology: Microsoft’s founders 
gave options in the company’s stock to all 
employees, creating an estimated 10,000 
millionaires in the process. Boy, did that 
set a precedent! Most technology compa-
nies treat employees well, and their work-
ers have come to expect to be pampered 
in exchange for working long hours on 
groundbreaking ideas.
 ✓ Small businesses: Many small businesses 
are trying to do business in new ways, 
and that often means taking a responsible 
approach to products, customers, and 
employees. They do this to get a competi-
tive advantage over their older, more staid 
competitors. Some of these companies will 
be publicly traded; others will still be in the 
venture capital or angel investing stage 
(see Chapter 6 for more about these start-
up pursuits).
 ✓ Service companies: A firm with a busi-
ness that requires a great deal of one-on-
one customer contact, such as a hotel, is 
somewhat more likely to behave respon-
sibly because it needs to keep so many 
people happy. It has to treat employees 
well or they’ll be surly, and it has to keep 
customers happy because they’ll be able to 
find employees to complain to when there 
are problems. No hiding here!

Part III
Putting Your 
Socially 
Responsible 
Choices into Action

In this part . . .
T
hink that as a social investor you’re limited to under-
performing mutual funds and safe but dull bank 
accounts? Think again.
Depending on your style, social investors can find a full 
range of investment products to suit their personal 
needs. You can choose stocks and bonds, real estate, or 
hedge funds, not to mention top mutual funds and feder-
ally insured profit-sharing accounts at Shariah-compliant 
banks. Some social investors may even want to take 
the route of microfinance, making small loans to small-
business owners around the world. This part explores 
the range of options out there for meeting your financial 
and personal goals.

Chapter 12
Buying and Selling Responsible 
Stocks and Bonds
In This Chapter
▶ A bird’s-eye view of the stock and bond markets
▶ Setting the stage for owning stocks
▶ Brushing up on buying bonds
▶ Touching on related securities that you may see
S
tocks and bonds are the most basic and traditional of investments. 
Other types of investments that you may consider, whether they’re as 
common as mutual fund or exchange-traded funds (covered in Chapter 13) 
or as fancy as hedge funds and venture capital (discussed in Chapter 16), use 
stocks and bonds.
Whether a stock or bond is responsible depends on your style and the per-
formance of the company that issues it. This chapter tells you how these 
securities are structured and how they trade so you can make better deci-
sions about how to work them into your portfolio. It also helps you under-
stand how the information that you uncover in your research (see Chapter 4) 
affects the value of the stocks and bonds that you’re interested in buying.
What You Need to Know about 
Securities Markets
Companies and governments need to raise money all the time. They have fac-
tories to build, new products to bring to market, and payrolls to meet. To do 
this, they can sell part ownership of the company to someone else by issuing 
stock, or they can borrow money by issuing bonds.

194
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Because investors often have extra money, they can buy these shares of 
stock or these bonds to get back more money in the future. (You may not 
think you have extra money, but if you’re putting even a little bit away today 
to pay for retirement or something else special down the road, then you have 
something extra! Doesn’t that make you feel a little bit better about your 
financial condition?)
The securities markets are where companies that need money and investors 
who have money to spare meet and fulfill each other’s needs. Historically, it 
was a physical location, such as the New York Stock Exchange, where bro-
kers would match the trades between the buyers and the sellers. Now these 
transactions mostly take place electronically, although the New York Stock 
Exchange still has some floor operations.
For most investors, stocks and bonds themselves are socially neutral. (The 
primary exception would be for investors following Islam’s prohibition on 
paying or receiving interest; they wouldn’t want to invest in bonds.) Instead, 
it’s the responsibility of the issuing company that determines which stock or 
bond you want to include in your portfolio.
One way to find these companies is through research. A second way is to get 
a list through an index or service of those companies that meet your social 
criteria, and then do the research on their investment suitability. (Chapter 4 
covers investment research in great detail.)
 
Things change very quickly; a company that may have made your social cut a 
year ago might not now, and vice versa.
Getting your return
Investors buy stocks and bonds because they want to make money. It’s nice 
if you can support the underlying business or help a fine company grow, but 
the name of the game is still profit.
Profits come in two main forms:
 
✓ Income: Income is a regular payment, such as interest or a dividend.
 
✓ Capital appreciation: Capital appreciation happens when you can sell 
something for more than you paid for it.
The two have different effects on portfolios and taxes. I cover them in more 
detail in the following sections.

195
 Chapter 12: Buying and Selling Responsible Stocks and Bonds
Incoming income
Investment income is the regular stream of payments generated by the stocks, 
bonds, and other securities that you own. For tax purposes, it’s handled dif-
ferently from earned income, which is the money you make from your job or 
your business.
Interest income, which comes from bonds, certificates of deposit, and bank 
accounts, is money paid to compensate you for lending money to someone 
else. When it’s paid by a bond, it is called a coupon (a term left over from 
the days when securities were printed on paper rather than traded elec-
tronically). Coupon payments usually arrive twice a year in your brokerage 
account.
Dividends are payments that corporations make to their shareholders out of 
their profits. Companies don’t have to pay dividends, and many don’t. Most 
dividend-paying companies declare their payments quarterly; the funds show 
up in your brokerage account.
 
Interest is a tax-deductible business expense to a corporation. Dividends 
are not deductible; they are paid out of after-tax income. Then the holder of 
the bond and the owner of the stock pay taxes on the interest and dividends 
received. Because the corporation doesn’t pay tax on interest but the bond-
holders do, interest is taxed just once. Because the corporation pays tax on 
the income that goes toward dividends, and then the shareholders pay tax 
again, dividends are taxed twice.
As of this writing, bond income is taxed at the regular earned income rate, 
which is currently a maximum of 35 percent. Dividend income is taxed at a 
lower rate, 15 percent. Even if you reinvest interest or dividends, the tax is 
paid in the same year that they are paid to you. Because tax laws change, be 
sure to check for the most recent information if you’re generating income in a 
taxable account.
Counting on capital gains
When you make an investment, you hope to buy low and sell high. The differ-
ence between the low and the high is a capital gain. The gain is realized only 
when you sell the security that you hold; until you do that, your gain exists only 
on paper — hence, capital gains are called paper gains until the stock is sold.
Capital gains are the primary way that stock investors make money. Although 
there’s some risk to having a big gain on paper that may or may not be real-
ized, there’s also a huge advantage: Investors don’t have to pay tax on their 
capital gains until they are realized.

196
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
When dealing with the IRS, you’ll need to segregate your short-term capital 
gains from your long-term ones. Short-term gains are gains on assets held for 
less than one year (under the current tax law); long-term gains are held for 
more than a year. The big difference is that under current law, short-term gains 
are taxed at your regular income rate, which could be as high at 35 percent, 
while long-term gains are taxed at just 15 percent.
If you end up selling your investment for less money than you paid for it, 
then you have a capital loss. Capital losses aren’t all bad, though; they can be 
used to offset your capital gains, reducing the amount of taxes you owe. You 
can get all the details on how to do this in “IRS Publication 550, Investment 
Income and Expenses,” which is available at www.irs.gov.
 
If you buy a bond when it’s issued and hold on to it until maturity, you’ll have 
no capital gains or losses. However, if you buy a bond at any time after issue 
or sell it at any time before maturity, there may well be a price difference. If 
it’s in your favor, then you have a taxable capital gain.
Working with a broker
When you’re ready to start investing, you have to purchase most stocks and 
bonds through a brokerage firm that can take your order, find someone to 
take the other side (to sell if you’re buying or buy if you’re selling), make the 
trade, and then transfer the securities to you.
It’s technically possible to make trades without involving a brokerage firm, 
and many large investment companies have set up electronic communica-
tions networks to let you do just that. Those same firms use brokers, too, and 
so will you if you want to play with these securities.
Although you have to set up an account with some sort of broker, you can 
choose from several different types:
 
✓ Full service
 
✓ Discount
 
✓ Financial planner
Any of these professionals can support your financial social goals. Want to 
find out more about each? Keep reading!
 
Not all brokers and financial planners are convinced that social investing has 
any advantages, and they may well try to talk you out of it. Be sure to ask your 
adviser’s opinion, and keep looking if you don’t like the answer. And you can 
always send that narrow-minded broker a copy of this book. . . .

197
 Chapter 12: Buying and Selling Responsible Stocks and Bonds
 
You may see firms described as broker or dealer or both. The terms are often 
used interchangeably, but there is a difference. A broker matches buyers and 
sellers of securities, while a dealer buys and sells securities out of its own 
account. Almost all brokerage firms are both brokers and dealers.
Full-service brokers
A full-service broker, also called a registered representative or an account execu-
tive, gives customers advice on their investment portfolios. He makes recom-
mendations about what to buy and what to sell, often providing research to 
support that advice. These people often work for full-service brokerage firms 
with household names, such as Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley, but they 
may also work for banks or small, regional brokerage firms.
As compensation for their services, full-service brokers charge a range of 
fees. Some firms charge an annual account fee, some charge a percentage of 
assets under management, and others charge a commission for each trans-
action made. Make sure that you understand how you’re being charged and 
that the advice you’re receiving is worth it. The fee schedule may be buried 
deep in a lot of boring legalese in your account paperwork, so it’s easier to 
ask. Full-service brokers aren’t the cheapest way to invest, but their services 
pay off for many customers.
Brokers have to pass examinations and submit to background checks admin-
istered by FINRA, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. (And yes, the 
fingerprints really are checked against arrest records, as more than one pro-
spective broker has found to his chagrin.) You can go online to look up the 
registration and disciplinary status of a broker you’re considering working 
with. Go to www.finra.org, and click the link for “FINRA BrokerCheck.”
In general, the broker is more important than the firm he works for. Every 
firm has a few outstanding employees and a few bad apples. You want to 
make sure that the broker you use will help you manage your money accord-
ing to your investment style and will ensure that the products in your 
account are right for you, not just those that pay the highest commissions to 
the broker. After you check out a broker through FINRA, sit down with him 
and ask a few questions:
 
✓ How do you feel about my socially responsible investment style?
 
✓ How many of your clients invest socially?
 
✓ How do you choose socially responsible stocks and mutual funds?
 
✓ What types of clients do you prefer to work with? What’s your trading 
and investment philosophy?
 
✓ How much experience do you have? What did you do before you became 
a broker? What training and qualifications do you have?

198
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
 
✓ How much education do you provide your clients about their financial 
strategy and investment choices?
 
✓ How quickly do you usually return calls? Will you meet with me in 
person? How do you prefer to communicate with clients?
 
✓ What is your minimum account size and minimum order size?
 
✓ What products pay you the highest commissions? What mutual fund 
companies do you recommend and why?
 
✓ Do you charge an annual fee, or do you charge commissions? If I have a 
choice, what type of account do you recommend for me and why?
 
✓ Do you have any references whom I can contact?
 
If you don’t like the answers, keep looking; there are plenty of good brokers 
out there, so you don’t have to deal with someone who isn’t a good fit for you. 
You can ask friends for referrals, or you can call the brokerage firm office and 
ask for advice. You may get sent to the first available broker rather than one 
who is your dream registered representative, but that’s okay as long as you’re 
willing to ask questions and walk away if necessary.
Discount brokers
Many investors make their own decisions about what stocks and bonds they 
want to buy and sell. They may have small accounts and thus not be able 
to get the value of a full-service broker (see the preceding section for more 
about these folks). Or they may be primarily interested in mutual funds. If any 
of these descriptions apply to you, you may want to check out a discount bro-
kerage firm. These firms charge much lower fees and commissions than full-
service brokers do. They don’t provide as much service, either. No one will 
take you to lunch, but then, no one will use that lunch to sell you a mutual 
fund with a high commission that isn’t a great fit for your investment goals.
Discount brokers provide some services, just not as many as full-service 
brokers do. Many have online calculators and investment guides that can 
help you figure out how to set and reach your financial goals. Some provide a 
range of research services, such as access to newsletters or ratings services. 
A few even have registered representatives on staff who can provide you with 
information about different investments, if not specific recommendations. 
Still, your primary relationship will be with the firm, not any one employee, 
so you need to check out how the roster of services that you’ll use compares 
to the fees charged. Some of the questions to ask are:
 
✓ What is your commission schedule? Do you also charge account mainte-
nance or other fees?
 
✓ What is the minimum account size? What is the minimum order size? Do 
I have to make a minimum number of trades each year?
 
✓ What research services do you offer? Do you have analytical tools or 
calculators?

199
 Chapter 12: Buying and Selling Responsible Stocks and Bonds
 
✓ Do you offer educational services or seminars?
 
✓ What markets and securities can I trade through your firm?
 
✓ Can I buy mutual funds through you? Which mutual fund companies do 
you deal with?
 
✓ What types of investors do you cater to? Are you a better option for 
day traders, small investors, or wealthy investors who make their own 
decisions?
 
✓ Can I talk to a human being? Does your staff offer investment advice or 
technical support? Where are they located?
 
The cheapest discount broker may not be the best for you. Some online bro-
kers charge no commission. They make money on trading, and they don’t offer 
a full range of services.
Financial planners
Many people want and need a lot of advice. They want to deal with someone 
who can help them manage their budgets, their savings, their insurance, and 
their taxes. The solution is a financial planner, who can look at all of your 
assets and liabilities and make detailed recommendations about how you 
should manage your money. Many financial planners specialize in different 
socially responsible investment strategies, so they can come up with recom-
mendations that suit your needs and values.
Some financial planners work independently. Some are on staff at larger 
financial planning firms, and still others may be full-service brokers, insur-
ance agents, or accountants. An ideal financial planner will take an objective 
look at your current financial position, assess your goals, and make an objec-
tive recommendation for how you should invest your money. The reality is 
that many financial planners push certain products or financial strategies no 
matter what your needs are. And, no surprise, these recommendations tend 
to involve high commissions.
Yet because their services are so comprehensive, most financial planners 
tend to charge high fees or recommend products that carry high commis-
sions. That’s fine if the recommendations improve your financial position 
enough to offset the fee. Good financial planners are worth the money. Bad 
ones are not. You need to make sure that the person you’re hiring is going to 
be able to do a good job for you. Some questions to ask are:
 
✓ How do you feel about my socially responsible investment style?
 
✓ How many of your clients invest with social guidelines?
 
✓ What types of clients do you prefer to work with? What is your financial 
planning philosophy? What is your minimum account size?
 
✓ How much experience do you have? When did you become a financial 
planner? What training and qualifications do you have?

200
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
 
✓ Are there certain types of products that you think everyone should 
have? Why?
 
✓ Do you charge a fee, earn commissions, or both? If you charge a fee, is 
it based on assets, is it a flat fee, or is it an hourly rate? What fee would 
you charge me for your services?
 
✓ How often would you want to meet with me? How do you prefer that 
clients contact you?
 
✓ Will other people work on my financial plan? Who are these people, 
what do they do, and how do they get paid?
 
✓ Can I see a sample financial plan?
 
✓ What products pay you the highest commissions? What mutual fund and 
insurance companies do you recommend, and why?
 
✓ Do you have any references whom I can contact?
Using margin for leverage
Many stock and bond investors goose up their returns with leverage — using 
borrowed money to get a higher return. This arrangement is called margin, 
and almost every brokerage firm offers it. Of course, margin means taking on 
more risk, so it’s not suitable for all investors.
Here’s how it works: You decide to buy 100 shares of stock worth $20 each, 
for a total investment of $2,000. You put up $1,000 of your own money and 
borrow $1,000 from the broker at 10 percent interest. If the stock goes up to 
$31 per share, then you have a profit of $1,000 after paying off the loan and 
interest, doubling the amount of your initial investment. If the stock goes 
down to $11, though, you still have to pay back the loan and the interest, so 
you’re left with nothing.
Of course, the brokerage firm probably won’t let you lose everything; as your 
losses mount, you’ll receive a margin call ordering you to put more money in 
your account. If you don’t, the broker will sell your stock for you. The broker 
does this to ensure that the loan is paid off.
Minimum margin requirements are set by the Federal Reserve Board and are 
designed to keep the financial system stable, so begging and pleading won’t 
work. Many an investor has been forced to sell a security to meet a margin 
call, only to watch it go up in price a week later.
If you’re an experienced investor who wants to take some risk and who has 
no objection to paying interest, than margin may be right for you. If you 
aren’t sure that it’s appropriate, then it probably isn’t.

 Chapter 12: Buying and Selling Responsible Stocks and Bonds
Buying Socially Responsible Stocks
A share of common stock, also called equity, is a security that represents 
a fractional interest in the ownership of a company. It allows a company 
to raise the money to grow while sharing ownership among thousands of 
people. Buy one share of Hershey (NYSE: HSY), and you’re a partial owner of 
the company. Of course, your stake will be small relative to that of the Milton 
Hershey School, a boarding school for orphaned and disadvantaged chil-
dren that owns 79.9 percent of the voting stock of the company. The Milton 
Hershey School may have voting control, but you still have a stake in the 
company. Instead of making direct decisions about how the company should 
be run, stockholders elect a board of directors to represent their interests.
A key feature of stock is that it has limited liability. If the company goes bank-
rupt, shareholders can lose all of their investment — and not a penny more. 
The lenders can’t come after the shareholders’ personal assets for the money 
they’re owed.
Your company may pay you a dividend, which is a small cash payment made 
out of its profits. Most of your return (you hope) will come from capital gains, 
which is an increase in the price of the stock between when you buy it and 
when you sell it. (See the earlier section, “Getting your return,” for more 
about dividends and capital gains.)
The social responsibility of any stock, of course, is determined by the com-
pany’s policies relative to your goals.
How stocks trade
Stocks are priced based on a single share, but they almost always trade in 
groups of 100 shares, known as a round lot. If you buy less than a round lot, 
you’ll probably have to pay a higher commission.
A stock’s price is determined by the supply and demand for the shares, and 
that’s usually a function of expected performance. If people expect a com-
pany to do well, they’ll want to buy the stock, and that will drive the price 
up. If they aren’t excited about its prospects, then they’ll sell shares, and that 
will take the price down.
 
There are lots of reasons to sell a stock. There is only one reason to buy: 
because you think the stock is going to increase in price.

202
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Every stock has two prices: a bid and an ask. The bid is the price at which 
the broker buys stock from you if you’re selling; the ask is the price at which 
the broker sells to you if you’re the one buying. The difference, known as the 
spread, is the broker’s profit.
Here’s an example of a price quote:
WFMI $22.03 $22.17
This is a quote for Whole Foods Market (Nasdaq: WFMI). The bid price is 
$22.03, and the ask is $22.17. Spreads may be as small as a penny, but they 
can be higher, especially if the company’s stock doesn’t trade often or if 
there’s news that’s bringing a lot of buyers or sellers to the market.
 
The brokerage firm makes money from the commission and from the spread. 
When interviewing brokers and financial planners, make sure to ask about the 
commission that you’ll be charged to trade. However, the commission is only 
one part of the cost. Some brokerage firms do a better job than others of keep-
ing a small spread. If you expect to trade often, you need to consider the firm’s 
ability to execute the trade with a narrow spread as well as the cost of the 
commission. Firms that work with active traders make their execution data 
available for the asking.
Where U.S. stocks trade
U.S. stocks trade mostly on organized exchanges like the New York Stock 
Exchange and Nasdaq. Many brokerage firms belong to the exchanges them-
selves. Smaller brokerage firms and financial planning companies often use a 
correspondent firm for trading, receiving a cut of the commission but giving 
the work to someone else.
No matter how you contact your brokerage firm to place an order, the firm’s 
trading staff will execute it wherever it can get the best deal. But is that 
the best deal for you or for the brokerage firm? It’s tough to know the right 
answer. In general, firms that do the most trading and participate in several 
exchanges and electronic communications networks can get you the best 
execution.
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)
The New York Stock Exchange has been synonymous with big money for more 
than 200 years. Most of the largest U.S. corporations trade on it, paying hand-
somely to do so. Besides paying the listing fee, a New York Stock Exchange 

203
 Chapter 12: Buying and Selling Responsible Stocks and Bonds
company usually needs to have at least 2,200 shareholders, trade at least 
100,000 shares a month, carry a market capitalization (number of shares out-
standing multiplied by price per share) of at least $100 million, and generate 
annual revenues of at least $75 million.
Much NYSE trading takes place the old-fashioned way: on the trading floor at 
the exchange’s building at the corner of Broad and Wall streets in New York 
City. That style of trading is becoming obsolete, so the NYSE has developed 
its own electronic communications networks to accommodate traders who 
value the faster, easier trading possible over an Internet connection.
Nasdaq
Nasdaq used to stand for the National Association of Securities Dealers 
Automated Quotation System, but now it’s just a name, not an acronym (pro-
nounced naz-dak). It was founded as an electronic communications network, 
almost like an Internet for traders before the Internet was available. At first, 
it handled companies that were too small or too speculative to meet New 
York Stock Exchange listing requirements. Over time, brokers liked using the 
Nasdaq network, and technology companies that were once small became 
international behemoths that saw no reason to move their stock listing to 
the NYSE.
When a customer order to buy or sell comes in, the brokerage firm’s traders 
use the Nasdaq system to search for a matching order. If one exists, then 
the trader can execute the order. If not, he can send a message to traders 
at other firms to see if they have interest in picking up the order. To ensure 
a regular flow of order activity, Nasdaq has several market makers. They 
are employees of member brokerage firms who agree to buy and sell some 
shares of a designated stock every day to ensure that there’s some supply 
and demand in the market.
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTC BB)
The Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board is the market for public companies that 
don’t qualify for Nasdaq listing. Some of these are foreign stocks that trade in 
the U.S. but that aren’t listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on Nasdaq. 
American Bulletin Board companies will have four-letter ticker symbols fol-
lowed by “.OB”. For example, ICP Solar Technologies’ ticker symbol is ICPR.
OB. Foreign issuers trade with five-letter symbols — four letters followed by 
an F. ACS Motion Control, based in Israel, trades as ACSEF.
Your broker will get quotes for Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board stocks through 
Nasdaq. Although these stocks don’t trade on Nasdaq, the communication 
system allows traders to find the current prices and locate buyers and sellers.

204
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
 
Many Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board companies are fine, but others used 
to be on Nasdaq and were delisted because they lost a lot of money. Tread 
carefully.
Pink Sheets
Before trading went electronic, there wasn’t an easy place to trade many 
companies’ shares. Shares in some smaller companies would go for days 
without seeing a buy or sell order. To value these stocks, brokerage firms 
subscribed to a weekly newsletter that listed the prices for those companies. 
It was printed on pink paper, hence the common name was the Pink Sheets.
Over the years, Nasdaq expanded so it could list more companies, while the 
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board was created for companies that couldn’t be 
listed on Nasdaq. Hence, the number of public companies that weren’t listed 
anywhere and that didn’t trade very often became very small.
The Pink Sheets are now available online (www.pinksheets.com). Pink 
Sheet companies don’t have listing requirements. The companies are public, 
but they don’t qualify for listing on Nasdaq or Over-the-Counter Bulletin 
Board, usually because they are behind on their filings with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. These companies have four- or five-letter ticker 
symbols and are sometimes shown with the suffix “.PK” after the ticker. Most 
brokerage firms can handle orders for Pink Sheet stocks.
 
Some Pink Sheet companies are frauds. Because the listing requirements are 
so few, the Pink Sheets are filled with penny stocks (those trading at less than 
$1 per share), shell companies, and securities with prices that can be easily 
manipulated by a crooked broker. Many investors have been burned when 
they start trading in this market. There are some good businesses in the pinks, 
but it’s a market for sophisticated traders only.
Buying, otherwise known as going long
When you buy a stock, you are said to be long it. When you sell it, you are 
short, and I’ll talk about that later in the chapter.
Buying a stock is pretty simple: You open a brokerage account, you place the 
order, you put the money in your account (you have three business days to 
pay), and then you’re a happy shareholder. You won’t receive a certificate; 
the stock itself will be held in electronic form. It will also be held in the name 
of the brokerage firm, known as street name. The brokerage firm is respon-
sible for sending you annual reports, proxy statements, and any correspon-
dence about your holding. It maintains the transaction record and credits 
any dividends to your account.

205
 Chapter 12: Buying and Selling Responsible Stocks and Bonds
 
If you need to have the stock certificate or want the holding to be registered 
in your own name, you can do both, but your brokerage firm will almost defi-
nitely charge you extra. Electronic order entry and street name have been the 
norm for decades and work well, so opt for the extras only if you have a spe-
cific reason.
Buying and holding
Many investors buy stock with the hope of holding it for a long time. They do 
lots of ongoing research (see Chapter 4) to make sure that the company is 
still a good one and still matches their social goals, but they keep owning it. 
And that’s a fine approach to owning stocks. Holding is cheap — brokerages 
charge commissions to buy and sell, not to hold — and the capital gains accu-
mulate free of taxes until you sell.
 
Although you can make huge profits by buying and holding good growth 
companies (wouldn’t you like to have been in on the initial public offering of 
something like Johnson & Johnson?), not all companies stay good and growing 
forever. Don’t fall in love with a stock, because it will not love you back. If the 
situation changes, it may be time to sell.
When you hold a stock for a while, you may notice one day that you own 
more shares, but the price is lower. You have received a stock split. The com-
pany simply increases the number of shares that each shareholder has, and 
the price falls by the same amount. If you held 100 shares worth $30 each, 
and the company announced a 2-for-1 stock split, you’d end up with 200 
shares worth $15 each. Your total value hasn’t changed. Because there’s no 
change in total value, a stock split isn’t a taxable event; in fact, it’s more of a 
nonevent.
A company with a low stock price might do a reverse split in an attempt to 
make the stock look better in the market. Hence, you may start with 100 
shares worth $1 each; then the company announces a 1-for-5 reverse split, 
and you have 20 shares worth $5 each with no change in total value. Reverse 
splits tend to be viewed badly. True, there’s been no change in value, but the 
thought is that the company has run out of ideas for building the business 
and is now reduced to playing games to make the stock price look good.
Trading
Many of the people in the stock market aren’t investors; they are traders. The 
difference is that investors tend to hold good stocks for a long time, while 
traders have a short-term mentality. Some traders, known as day traders, only 
plan on holding a company for a few minutes! Others may be interested in 
holding a position for a few weeks or months, but rarely more than a year.

206
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Trading isn’t terribly compatible with most socially responsible investment 
styles. The incompatibility has nothing to do with trading itself, which is 
important for keeping markets liquid. Rather, socially responsible restric-
tions make trading difficult, and the short holding period for trading limits 
the ability to be an activist investor.
A trader needs to have a large universe of securities to look at; on any given 
day, only a handful of stocks may present good short-term opportunities. 
That pool of stocks may be further limited by excluding companies because 
of their revenue sources or their governance practices. After all of those 
restrictions are applied, the selection of socially responsible stocks can be 
too limiting.
The second reason why trading and social investing don’t fit well together is 
that social investors often use the powers of capitalism to encourage com-
panies to do the right thing. If you hold a stock for a very short time period, 
the company won’t notice any effect on long-term value from appealing to 
your better nature, nor will you have any ability to influence the company’s 
choices.
Profiting when stocks go down: 
Short selling
Normally, investors buy stocks in the hopes that they’ll make money when 
the stock goes up in price. Unfortunately, stocks also go down, as many 
investors have found to their chagrin. Wouldn’t it be great if you could make 
money on a declining company?
Well, you can, through the magic of short selling. Short selling allows you to 
bet on a future decline in the price of a security, just as going long lets you 
bet on a future gain (see the previous section). It’s risky, though.
When you want to sell short, you first need to do some research. This helps 
you know exactly why a security is overvalued and what it will take for the 
rest of the market to realize that. For example, does a company use unusual 
accounting methods? Is it making money while other companies in the same 
industry are struggling? Has management been hyping the potential of its 
product beyond any reasonable rate of sales? If so, you may be able to profit 
from an overvalued situation.
 
Sell something short only if you have done thorough research that indicates 
that the stock is overvalued in the market. Do not sell short simply because 
you don’t like the company. Short selling is risky even for people who do the 
work; it’s a quick way for others to lose a lot of money.

207
 Chapter 12: Buying and Selling Responsible Stocks and Bonds
All brokerage firms can handle short sales. You have to have an account that 
is approved for margin, because you’ll be borrowing stock to make the trade. 
You place a sell order and indicate that it’s a short sale. The broker arranges 
for you to borrow stock from another holder in the firm. (This is easy to do 
when all the shares are held in the broker’s name, and no, the lender rarely 
knows that his shares have been lent out.) After the stock is borrowed, it’s 
sold. The short seller waits for the price to fall and then buys back the stock 
at the lower price to repay the loan. The profit is the difference between 
the price sold and the price of the repurchase, less the interest charged on 
the loan.
Of course, if the stock goes up, the short seller has to pay a higher price 
when buying back the stock, and he still has to pay the interest. Ouch! And 
the interest accumulates while waiting for the price to go down, so if it takes 
a long time, that can offset the profit.
Traders can’t be both long and short at the same time on the same stock. If 
you short a stock you already own, you are in effect selling it, and your return 
is the difference between where you bought the stock and where you shorted 
it. Stock investors can protect themselves from declining share prices. It’s 
beyond the scope of this book, but some of the guides to stock investing 
listed in the appendix can give you the information you need.
Buying Socially Responsible Bonds
A bond is nothing more than a loan that is standardized for easy trading. 
When an investor buys a bond, the money goes to the issuer. In exchange 
for the use of the money, the issuer agrees to pay interest on a regular basis, 
usually twice a year. Each payment is known as a coupon, a convention 
that goes back more than 30 years to a time when bonds had little coupons 
attached to them. When each was due, the bond holder would cut off the 
coupon and take it to the bank.
Because of these steady coupon payments, bonds are often referred to as 
fixed-income investments. The money that’s borrowed in the first place, called 
the principal, isn’t repaid until the date that the bond comes due, known as 
the maturity. Most bonds have a maturity of more than ten years; if they come 
due in a shorter amount of time, they are often called notes instead. A bond 
that matures in one year or less is usually called a bill.
Sometimes, the principal is split from the interest payments so investors who 
want regular payments can get those while an investor who wants a single 
sum at a future date can get that.

208
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
The coupon part of the bond is known as a strip, while the remaining prin-
cipal is called a zero-coupon bond. Related to the zero-coupon bond is the 
discount bond, which is sold at the principal value less the amount of interest 
that will accrue while the bond is held. When the bond matures, the holder 
receives the full face value. Treasury bills are sold as discount bonds.
If a bond issuer goes bankrupt, the bondholders get their money before any 
shareholders do. Often, the shareholders are left with nothing. That’s one 
reason that bonds have less risk than stocks.
Bonds are popular with conservative investors who want low risk and steady 
cash flow. Many retirees keep part of their savings in bonds to give them the 
money they need to enjoy their work-free years. During inflationary times, 
bonds may offer higher returns than other types of investments.
As with stocks, the social responsibility of the bond is related to the behavior 
of the bond’s issuer rather than the bond itself.
Types of bonds
Bonds are classified according to the issuer: a domestic company, the federal 
government, a local government, or someone in another country. Each of 
these groups has some different nuances to consider as you think of how the 
investment suits your financial goals as well as your social ones.
Corporate bonds
Corporate bonds are issued by companies that need to borrow money. These 
businesses tend to be large enough and established enough that bond buyers 
will be interested in their deal. (Many companies work with banks rather 
than issue bonds, often because they don’t need to raise enough money to 
make a bond offering worthwhile.)
Bonds are often issued to finance major construction projects, such as a new 
manufacturing plant, or to help a company make an acquisition. You can 
choose from a few different types of corporate bonds to complement your 
socially responsible style.
High-grade bonds
When a company wants to issue a bond, it’s given a rating, or grade, by a 
rating agency, such as Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s. Analysts at these firms 
research the company’s financial situation and then assign a rating. The 
rating is similar to the score that credit bureaus assign to individuals that 
affects how easy it will be for them to get a mortgage at a good rate.

209
 Chapter 12: Buying and Selling Responsible Stocks and Bonds
The best rating, usually shown as AAA or Aaa, depending on the agency, is 
awarded to companies that have the best credit. These companies are the 
least likely to need money and the most likely to pay back whatever they do 
borrow. Hence, these borrowers have little risk, so they pay the lowest rates 
of interest.
Borrowers that are still considered to be good risks but don’t meet the high-
est rating are assigned slightly lower rates, usually arranged as AA, A, and 
BBB in descending order.
Junk bonds
Companies with low credit ratings, usually two Bs or less, are considered 
to be less likely to pay back their debt. This doesn’t mean that they won’t 
pay the debt back, just that they are less of a sure thing. In exchange for the 
risk, buyers of these bonds demand higher rates of interest. These low-rated 
bonds are usually referred to as junk bonds, even though people who actu-
ally work with the bonds prefer the nicer-sounding term high-yield bonds. 
Nevertheless, the not-so-nice term has stuck.
Junk bonds are often issued by companies as parts of acquisitions, when the 
buyer needs to borrow a lot of money to complete the purchase. In many 
cases, these are hostile transactions in which the seller doesn’t want to be 
bought and thus won’t cooperate in financing the deal. Other junk bonds 
are those of companies that used to have a higher rating but are now facing 
fading financial fortunes.
Government bonds
Government bonds are issued by the U.S. government. Are these bonds 
responsible? Some social investors avoid U.S. government bonds because 
they disagree with many of the government’s uses of funds, especially mili-
tary spending. Others like these bonds because they avoid the problems that 
may arise with private companies, such as sources of revenue or corporate 
governance.
Because of the gap between what the government takes in from taxes and 
what it has committed to spend, the U.S. government is constantly issuing 
bonds. It’s easy to buy them, too. Treasury bond buyers can go straight to 
the government’s Web site, www.treasurydirect.gov, to open an account 
and place orders.
International bonds
International bonds are issued by governments and corporations outside of 
the United States. The dynamics are similar to those of corporate and govern-
ment bonds issued in the U.S., with one major exception: They usually have 

210
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
exposure to foreign currency. Is this good or bad? Well, it depends on where 
the U.S. dollar is on any given day. If the dollar is weak, then an international 
bond can have a higher dollar return than a similar U.S. security; but if the 
dollar is strong, the opposite will happen. Managers of international bond 
mutual funds often use different risk-management techniques to reduce the 
negative effects of exchange-rate changes. It may be difficult, but not impos-
sible, for individuals to do the same. That makes mutual funds a great option 
for international bond investors, and those are discussed in Chapter 13.
Municipal bonds
Municipal bonds are issued by state and local governments, often to support 
infrastructure spending or economic development projects. The beauty of 
these issues is that the interest is exempt from federal income taxes and may 
be exempt from state taxes, too. That’s a nifty little bonus! To find out more 
about how municipal bonds are used, turn to Chapter 6.
How bonds trade
A single bond usually has a face value of $1,000. Many brokers will trade only 
one at a time, but some require a minimum trade of ten of the same bonds 
at a time. Most bondholders want steady income and hold their bonds until 
they mature, so bonds don’t trade as often as stocks do. The market value 
of a bond is mostly determined by the level of interest rates in the economy. 
When interest rates go up, bond prices go down; when rates go down, bond 
prices go up. Bond prices are also affected by how likely the loan is to be 
repaid. If traders think that the bond issuer is near bankruptcy, then the 
bond price will fall.
 
Generally speaking, only corporate and municipal bonds have repayment risk; 
the U.S. government can always print money to meet its obligations. Most 
international government bonds have similarly low default risk because their 
governments also have printing presses, but that hasn’t stopped some nations 
from defaulting. Russia did just that in 1998, setting off much turmoil in finan-
cial markets, including the collapse of a major hedge fund, Long-Term Capital 
Management.
A bond price quote looks like this:
3.375 2009 Oct 15 n 101:08 101:09
This is a U.S. Treasury note maturing on October 15, 2009, and carrying an 
interest rate of 3.375 percent. The number right after the “n” (for “note”) is 
the bid. As with a stock, the bid is the price at which the dealer will buy the 

211
 Chapter 12: Buying and Selling Responsible Stocks and Bonds
bond from you if you’re selling. The second number is the ask, and it’s the 
price the dealer will charge you if you’re buying. The difference is the deal-
er’s profit, known as the spread.
Corporate bonds trade in 8ths of a percentage point, and Treasury bonds 
trade in 32nds. The bid of 101:08 means that the bond’s bid price is 101 8⁄32 
percent of the face value of $1,000, or $1,012.50.
 
The use of eighths and fractions of eighths, by the way, is nearly ancient; it 
dates back to before the American Revolution, when the main currency in the 
Americas was the Spanish doubloon, a large gold coin that could be cut into 
pieces for easy trade. Hence, they were known as “pieces of eight.” U.S. stocks 
traded in eighths until 2001; they now trade in orderly decimals.
Where U.S. bonds trade
Investment banks and the federal government sell new bonds directly to 
investors. If you want to buy a bond that has already been issued, or you 
want to sell a bond that you already own, you have to turn to the secondary 
market — the different ways of trading a bond by using a broker. Some bonds 
trade on organized exchanges, while others trade over-the-counter.
Listed bonds
Bonds issued by very large corporations often trade on the New York Stock 
Exchange. To buy or sell a listed bond, you place an order through your bro-
kerage firm, which sends an order to its broker working on the floor of the 
exchange. The process is almost identical to the trading of listed stocks (see 
the earlier section “How stocks trade” for more details).
Over-the-counter trading
Most corporate and municipal bonds trade over-the-counter. Instead of work-
ing with an organized exchange, brokerage firms use electronic communica-
tions networks, like Nasdaq services, to find buyers and sellers for different 
bonds. Because bonds don’t trade often, brokers often refer to a bond order 
as a search; the customer specifies the type of bond, the interest rate, and the 
maturity, and then the broker searches through the list of bonds to find one 
that comes close.
Treasury dealers
Unlike the corporate and municipal bond market, the Treasury market is one 
of the most liquid in the world. The best way for most individual investors to 
buy a new Treasury bond is directly from the government, because no com-
mission is involved.

212
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
After Treasury bonds are issued, they trade on a secondary market made up 
of Treasury dealers. These are large brokerage firms registered with the gov-
ernment who agree to buy and sell bonds and maintain a stable market for 
them. If your brokerage firm isn’t a Treasury dealer, it will have a relationship 
with one that it can send your order to.
Neither Fish nor Fowl: Other Securities
Whenever there’s a stream of cash and a rate of risk, an investment banker 
can create a new type of security to meet the needs of borrowers and inves-
tors alike. These alternatives aren’t as common as stocks and bonds, but you 
may well come across them. Sometimes they’ll be more suitable ways for you 
to invest, depending on market conditions, your financial goals, and your 
investment style.
I describe some of these securities in the following sections, but don’t worry: 
There will be others, as long as people keep dreaming up new ways for com-
panies to finance growth and for investors to make money.
Collateralized debt obligations
A collateralized debt obligation (CDO), likes its cousins, the collateralized 
bond obligation (CBO) and the collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO), is a 
pool of different loans sold in shares to investors. For example, a bank may 
take all of its car loans, put them into a single pool, and then sell investors 
certificates entitling them to a share of the pool. The investors then receive 
the principal and interest payments; if the borrowers skip out on their obliga-
tions, the certificate holders lose out. These investments offer investors 
a higher rate of return than with a traditional bond because they carry 
more risk.
 
Collateralized debt obligations picked up a bad name when the subprime 
mortgage crisis hit, and some big banks that should have understood the 
risks better were burned. These aren’t inherently irresponsible securities; 
they traded with few problems for decades. If the people selling the loans deal 
responsibly with borrowers and disclose accurate information to borrowers, 
they can be an appropriate investment in the right situation. Still, it’s a tricky 
market, and it’s not for investors who can’t take risk.

213
 Chapter 12: Buying and Selling Responsible Stocks and Bonds
Convertible stocks and bonds
Convertible securities are combinations of stocks and bonds. They’re issued as 
bonds or preferred stock (which I describe in the next section), but investors 
have the right to convert them into common stock at a predetermined price.
For example, you may be able to exchange a convertible security with a face 
value of $1,000 for 40 shares of stock at $20 each. If the stock is trading at less 
than $20, the holder would rather have the convertible because it pays interest 
(for a convertible bond) or a regular dividend (for convertible preferred bonds). 
If the stock is trading at more than $25, then it may make sense to convert 
because the shares would be worth more than the bond. Convertibles aren’t 
very common, but if you come across some, you now know what they are.
Preferred stock
Preferred stock is a security that pays its holders a regular, preset dividend. 
It’s a type of fixed-income security because the payment is predictable, but 
it’s not exactly the same.
First, a company has to pay its bond interest; it if misses a payment, the 
bondholders can force it into bankruptcy. If a company misses a preferred 
dividend, the preferred holders can’t order payment. The missed dividends 
are accrued and have to be paid before any common dividends are paid, but 
that may never happen. If the company does go bankrupt, bondholders are 
repaid before the preferred stockholders. The preferred stockholders, in 
turn, are repaid before common stock holders.
Some classes of preferred stock carry voting rights; they may be lesser or 
greater than the voting rights of common stock. As with convertibles, you may 
not see preferred stock very much, but when you do, you’ll understand it.
Sukuk
Under Islamic law, a Muslim may neither pay nor charge interest. Instead, 
returns are to be based on shared investment risk. Yet all over the world, 
Muslims want to buy houses, build factories, or improve roads, and they 
need financing to do it. To give people, companies, and governments the 
money they need to expand and to offer investors the low-risk, predictable 
returns that many of them want, the Sukuk was developed.

214
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Sukuk financing is often based on revenue that accrues from the construc-
tion of a physical asset. Instead of a mortgage, for example, a lease-to-own 
arrangement may be structured, with the Sukuk holders being the legal 
owners of the property until all lease payments are received. Few such con-
tracts trade in the United States, but they’re common in Europe, the Middle 
East, and Asia, and are likely to become more popular here.
 
You don’t have to be Muslim to use Sukuk financing, by the way; these securi-
ties may be purchased or issued by any investor who sees the value.

lthough you should have exposure to the stock markets, it’s tough 
for an individual investor to make money trading single stocks. It’s 
hard enough to find good companies to invest in, but adding a social screen 
throws in an extra level of work that may be intimidating. And, to reduce 
the risk in your portfolio, you should hold about 30 stocks. It takes a lot of 
money and time to accumulate those. Buying bonds poses similar problems. 
Minimum prices start at $1,000, making it costly to diversify across a range of 
maturities, rates, and issuers. (More on stocks and bonds in Chapter 12.)
Is the cliché right: Does it take money to make money? Well, you need to have 
a little bit of money to get started investing, but you don’t need to have a lot. 
Instead, consider mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which allow 
investors to reap the benefits of the stock and bond markets for a relatively 
low amount of money. And these funds aren’t just for people with small portfo-
lios; they offer many benefits for people with lots of money socked away.
Successful investing in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds involves a 
little upfront work, though. This chapter covers the information you need to 
know as you look for more ways to invest responsibly.

No Matter What Type of 
Fund You Choose . . .
Mutual funds and ETFs (exchange-traded funds, described later in this chap-
ter) are great ways for individual investors to leave the hard work of choos-
ing securities to someone else. But you still have to do some work. Later in 
this chapter, I explain the specific issues involved with the different types of 
funds, but here are a few concerns that may crop up no matter if you choose 
mutual funds, ETFs, or a mix of both.
Figuring out your investment needs
Funds are a great way to get started in investing, and they may be all that 
most individual investors will ever need. But simply owning a mutual fund is 
not a financial plan. This book is not so much about investing in general as 
it is about social investing. If you aren’t quite sure what your needs are or 
how to meet them, you may want to pick up a copy of Personal Finance For 
Dummies (Wiley) or meet with a financial planner. You certainly don’t want to 
invest willy-nilly, or you may give up fees and miss out on good opportunities.
 
The longer it is until you need the money, the more risk you can afford to 
take. (Risk is the likelihood of losing money or otherwise getting a return that 
you don’t expect.) A 28-year-old can take a lot of risk with retirement savings, 
but should not take risk with money being saved for the down payment on a 
house. That basic relationship between time and risk underlies most personal 
financial decisions.
Monitoring performance
Not all mutual funds and ETFs are the same, even if they have the same 
investment objective. Two different large-cap value mutual funds (mutual 
funds that invest in larger companies that are inexpensive relative to the 
market) can have different performance, as can two different emerging mar-
kets ETFs (exchange-traded funds that invest in lesser-developed countries) 
based on different indexes. The initial investment decision isn’t your only 
investment decision; you want to check the performance of your funds rela-
tive to similar investments to make sure you’re invested where you want 
to be. One good source for tracking mutual fund and ETF performance is 
Morningstar, www.morningstar.com.

217
 Chapter 13: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
 
There’s a fine line between adjusting your holdings based on performance 
and constantly selling low and buying high. If your stock mutual fund is down 
when the entire stock market is, that doesn’t make it a bad investment. In fact, 
that may be a good time to buy so you have money invested when the market 
inevitably turns around.
Working with a retirement plan
Many people use mutual funds as part of their retirement plan. If you’re man-
aging your own retirement funds, say through an IRA account, you can make 
your own decisions about where you put your money. Most mutual fund com-
panies and brokerage firms can set up these accounts for you, usually charg-
ing a small annual fee for the service; once established, you can buy and sell 
funds as needed until you’re ready to chuck your job and move to the beach.
If you’re saving through an employer retirement plan, such as a 401(k) plan, 
then you’re limited to the fund choices that the company offers. The funds 
may not fit your social goals. You can request that your employer add a suit-
able social fund to its array; but keep in mind that the employer has to meet 
federal regulations concerning retirement plan performance (see Chapter 3 
for more information), so you’ll have more luck if you can recommend a fund 
with good performance and low fees.
Getting acquainted with 
the different funds
Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have some significant differences, 
but they have a few things in common. Both types of funds collect money 
from large numbers of investors, and then hire professional managers to 
manage it. The money is invested in broader portfolios (a concept known as 
diversification) than would be possible for almost any of the individual inves-
tors to create on their own. Funds are available in a wide range of investment 
objectives and investment styles, so they can help investors diversify or help 
them pick up exposure to a narrow market sector.
Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are easy to buy. Write the check, 
place the order, and you’re a shareholder! Of course, that assumes you’ve 
done the research to know what your investment needs are and how any par-
ticular fund meets them. Each type of fund has almost countless variations 
(with new ones coming to market every day, it seems). The result can be a 
precise fit with your investment needs, but it can also be a bit overwhelming. 
Hey, that’s why I’m here. In the rest of this chapter, I help you navigate your 
way through the mutual fund and ETF jungle.

Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Grasping the Basics of Mutual Funds
In the United States, mutual funds are investment pools that are required to 
register with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940. The operators of these funds collect investments from 
large numbers of investors, and then hire investment managers who buy and 
sell securities for everyone’s benefit.
Legally, a mutual fund is a separate corporation that doesn’t pay taxes. 
Instead, the tax liability is passed on to the investors, who may or may not 
owe anything.
Mutual funds are a good fit for many individual investors, but they have some 
quirks that you’ll want to understand before taking the plunge. You can find 
the information in the prospectus, a legal document that mutual fund com-
panies must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and give to 
prospective investors, but the facts are buried in a lot of legalese. In the fol-
lowing sections, I give you a handy guide to some of the structural issues that 
can help you ask good questions and find the facts you need. If you’re going 
to pay a sales charge, transfer money, or pay taxes on your gains, you’ll want 
to know why and how! First, though, you need to get acquainted with the two 
main types of mutual funds.
Mutual funds fall into two types, open-end and closed-end. Open-end funds are 
far more common; most socially responsible options fall into this category.
Open-end mutual funds
Most mutual funds sold in the United States are open-end mutual funds. The 
funds buy and sell shares directly to shareholders, using prices at the end of 
every business day, issuing and redeeming shares as necessary. Invest $1,000 
in the fund, and the fund size grows by $1,000. Cash in $1,000 of your shares, 
and the fund shrinks by $1,000.
The good news? There’s always a market for your fund shares, no matter 
what’s happening in the financial markets. Of course, the fund manager may 
need to sell securities if the amount of the day’s redemptions exceeds the 
amount of cash on hand.
An open-end fund’s shares trade at its net asset value (NAV), which is the total 
market value of all the securities held in the fund divided by the total number 
of shares that the fund has issued. The fund will never sell for more or for less 
than the NAV. There may be an additional sales charge, called a load, which I 
explain in the “Loaded from the start” section later in this chapter.

219
 Chapter 13: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
Closed-end mutual funds
Closed-end funds are relatively rare, making up less than 10 percent of all 
the mutual funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute (www.ici.
org), the trade organization for mutual fund and ETF companies. A closed-
end fund issues a set number of shares when it goes public, and then doesn’t 
buy or sell any more. The fund managers invest the money but never have to 
deal with influxes or outflows of cash. Those interested in buying shares of 
a closed-end fund place orders through their brokers, who turn to the stock 
exchange to find existing shareholders who are selling.
Closed-end fund managers report the net asset value (or NAV; the value of 
all the securities divided by the total number of shares outstanding) to the 
different securities pricing services, so you’d think that a closed-end fund’s 
share price would match the net asset value. And yet, it rarely does. Instead, 
most closed-end funds trade at prices below their net asset values. It’s not 
what you would expect, but it’s a big draw to investors who are looking to 
buy stocks at a bargain.
Some closed-end fund shareholders have forced the fund managers to dis-
band the fund or convert it to an open-end fund in order to profit when the 
discount is eliminated. You shouldn’t count on that if you choose to invest 
in closed-end funds, unless of course your activist charge is corporate gover-
nance (discussed in Chapter 7).
 
If you want to find out more about closed-end and open-end mutual funds, 
there’s always Mutual Funds for Dummies (Wiley)!
Within open- and closed-end funds are different categories of funds you can 
choose from for your portfolio. I cover these categories in detail in “Choosing 
Your Mutual Funds,” later in the chapter.
Complexes, social and otherwise
Each mutual fund is its own corporation, but very few funds stand alone. 
Almost all are sponsored by mutual fund complexes, which can be the 
household-name investment companies, like Fidelity and Vanguard, or 
small firms offering just two or three funds, like some of the socially respon-
sible mutual fund companies listed later in this chapter. Those companies, 
also called fund families, organize different mutual funds based on where 
they see the market going. They hire the investment staff, market the funds, 
and manage customer relations. In exchange, each of the mutual funds pays 
a fee to the fund complex for its services. The fund complex often allows 
certain privileges to shareholders of its different funds, including unified 
statements and easy exchanges between its funds as a customer’s invest-
ment needs change.

220
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
As a legally distinct corporation, each fund has its own board of directors. 
In almost all cases, the board of directors rubber-stamps the fund manage-
ment complex’s decisions. Note that I said “almost all.” That’s because every 
now and again, the fund company management gets greedy, and the board 
of directors votes to give the fund’s management contract to a different firm. 
A handful of mutual fund companies avoid this problem by hiring outside 
investment managers as a matter of policy, giving the fund’s board more 
leverage.
Some fund families offer nothing but socially responsible funds, and several of 
those are covered in this chapter. However, a lot of general mutual fund com-
panies have a few socially responsible funds on offer. One decision you have to 
make is just how pure you want to be. Will it bother you to do business with a 
fund company that has funds that invest in ways you don’t like as well as funds 
that invest in ways that you do? Or will you find that the convenience — and 
the opportunity for the social fund to inspire others on staff managing other 
funds — outweighs your quest for purity?
Fee structure: Pay now, or pay later
Mutual funds aren’t free. Some funds charge a fee when you buy shares, some 
charge a fee when you sell shares, and all charge at least some fees while you 
own the fund to cover the costs of operation. Fees come out of performance 
and can add up over time, so you should pay attention to them.
 
Some sponsors of socially responsible mutual funds believe that investors will 
be so happy to find a fund that fits their values that they won’t pay attention to 
all the fees being levied. Promise me that you’ll pay attention. Almost all social 
investors have more than one fund or investment option to choose from.
Loaded from the start
The first fee you may, or may not, pay is called a load. That’s a sales charge 
incurred when you buy or sell shares. Many mutual funds have no load, and 
you can buy those directly through the mutual fund company offering the 
fund. Other funds come with front loads, which are sales charges that can be 
as high as 8.5 percent of the amount invested. More typically, front-end loads 
for stock funds will be in the 4 to 5 percent range. Some mutual funds have no 
front load but come with a contingent deferred sales charge, also called a back-
end load, which is charged when the fund is sold. The percentage charged 
often goes down each year you own the fund.
 
Load funds are almost always sold by brokers or financial planners, and they 
keep most of it as their commission. If you’re working with someone who 
is giving you good financial advice, then he should be compensated for the 
time and effort involved. That’s fair. But if you aren’t getting advice, you 
shouldn’t pay.

221
 Chapter 13: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
The hard-to-avoid 12b-1 fee
A 12b-1 fee, named for the paragraph of the law that allows it to be charged, 
is a fee charged to mutual fund shareholders to compensate the mutual fund 
companies for their marketing activities. Now, I don’t know about you, but I 
consider advertising and marketing to be part of a company’s cost of doing 
business. I’d be really ticked off if, say, my grocery store tacked a surcharge 
on my total to cover the costs of its weekly ads. Nevertheless, mutual funds 
are allowed to charge the fee, and most do. Legally, they can charge up to 
0.75 percent of assets each year under this rule, although most funds found 
that a really high fee leads to really low performance. A more typical 12b-1 
fee is 0.25 percent of assets; back-end load funds often charge much more.
Management fees and operating expenses
Managing a mutual fund can be an expensive proposition. The managers 
need access to data to evaluate a company’s investment prospects. They 
want to travel to meet a company’s managers and check out its facilities. 
And, of course, the fund staff expects to be paid for what it does! In addition, 
an accounting firm has to audit investment results, and a lawyer will ensure 
that the fund’s paperwork is right. These fees are charged to the fund in the 
form of management fees and other expenses.
Management fees can be quite low — around 0.20 percent of assets — for 
some types of funds, such as index funds (I explain these later in the chapter). 
For a fund with a complex strategy that requires intensive research, such as 
one that specializes in stock issued in developing countries, it wouldn’t be 
unusual to see management fees of 2 percent or so. The other expenses for 
legal, accounting, and related work can be low enough to be nearly negligible 
for a very large mutual fund, but they may be material for a small one.
All the fees charged to a fund each year, including the 12b-1 fee and other 
expenses, are summed up in the expense ratio. That’s the total percentage of 
assets paid to cover the costs associated with the fund. Obviously, the lower 
the better, but sometimes, it takes money to make money. (Loads aren’t 
included in the expense ratio.)
 
You can’t avoid paying fees, but you shouldn’t pay fees that are so high that 
they drag down the fund’s performance. Check out the fund’s performance 
after fees to make sure that you’re getting your money’s worth.
How to purchase a mutual fund
Buying a mutual fund is quite easy. For a no-load fund, which has no sales 
charge, you buy shares from the fund directly. You often fill out a paper form 
and mail in a check; some larger fund companies will let you transfer money 
from your checking account through their Web sites.

222
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
For load funds, you work through your broker or financial planner, who will 
transfer money from your account to the fund company.
If you have an account with an online brokerage firm, you can buy many load 
and no-load funds through it. Charles Schwab (www.schwab.com), for exam-
ple, has a mutual fund marketplace that allows its customers to buy a wide 
range of mutual funds through their existing Schwab accounts.
Tax considerations
Although a mutual fund is its own corporation, it’s exempt from income 
taxes. Instead, it passes its tax liabilities on to its investors. Each year, the 
mutual fund company sends you a statement telling you how much you 
earned. If the money is in a taxable account, then you’ll list those amounts on 
your tax return and pay the applicable taxes. If the account is sheltered, as 
with an IRA, you won’t owe anything now, although you may when you retire.
 
Your returns from a mutual fund are the same as the returns from the under-
lying assets, whether they be stocks or bonds. You can find out more about 
them in Chapter 12.
When you sell the mutual fund, you may trigger another taxable event, a gain 
on the sale. If the net asset value of the fund when you sold it is greater than it 
was when you bought it, you’ll pay a capital gains tax on that difference. In the 
United States, the capital gains tax is pretty low as of this writing (15 percent) — 
low, but not zero for most people.
Choosing Your Mutual Funds
When you invest your money in a mutual fund, you probably have some 
specific social and investment goals in mind. And that’s fair. The fund com-
panies spend countless hours developing strategies and promoting funds to 
show how each works for specific investors. Furthermore, under that ancient 
Investment Company Act of 1940, mutual fund companies must file a docu-
ment with the Securities and Exchange Commission called a prospectus that 
explains all the policies followed by the fund. They have to follow them, too. 
In 2008, the SEC fined a socially responsible mutual fund company $500,000 
for failing to follow its own policies.
 
Prospectuses are written by lawyers, and very few lawyers write like Scott 
Turow and John Grisham. Nevertheless, prospectuses are important, so you 
should read them when you make mutual fund decisions.

223
 Chapter 13: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
Mutual funds invest in stocks and bonds, discussed in Chapter 12. They fall 
into broad categories based on the types of securities that go into them. 
Social policies are secondary. Hence, a responsible aggressive growth fund 
will invest in stocks that are expected to appreciate in value, with those 
stocks also fitting predetermined social criteria. It wouldn’t be appropriate 
for such a fund to invest in a model company that was growing slowly and 
paying a high dividend, because that company would not fit the definition of 
“aggressive growth.” (And that would be a company that is expected to grow 
much faster than the economy in general.)
Later in the chapter, I supply you with a list of some of the many funds for 
socially responsible investing. For now, though, the following sections give 
you a rundown of the different fund categories.
 
Which type of category is right for you? That depends on your ability to toler-
ate risk, how much money you have to invest, and how long before you need 
the money. In general, people who are investing their money for a long time 
are best off in stocks, and those who can’t tolerate much risk should invest 
in bonds. Most people are best off in a mix of the two; one way to get that is 
through a total return fund.
Stock funds
Stock funds, also called equity funds, invest in shares of stock of different com-
panies. (Stock is covered in great detail in Chapter 12.) They are relatively 
inexpensive, relatively low-stress vehicles for getting exposure to a full range 
of companies, which usually leads to better long-term performance than most 
investors can achieve on their own. The objective is usually capital gains 
(from increases in the stock price), which mean that the fund managers try to 
generate profits by buying the stock low and selling it high. And yes, that’s a 
little easier said than done!
Within the world of stocks, different funds concentrate on different sectors of 
the securities markets and follow different types of investment styles, rang-
ing from conservative to risky. Because just about any investment strategy 
can be socially responsible, look through the following sections to see which 
strategies may fit your investment needs.
Growth funds
Growth funds invest in the stocks (also called equities) of companies that 
have faster-than-average profit growth, usually because they’re focused on 
new products, new markets, and good expense control. These funds can be 
a bit risky; some years, the stock market will lose money or show a lower 
return than the market as a whole. When held for years, though, the down 

224
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
years tend to be more than offset by the up years. Hence, growth funds are 
often a good choice for retirement savings and other needs where the money 
can be put away for a long time.
 
Return is your reward for taking risk. The higher the risk, the higher the 
expected return. Of course, no return is guaranteed.
Index funds
When people talk about the market being up or down, they are talking about 
the performance of the market indexes. These are representative collections 
of stocks designed to measure the performance of the market in general. 
Among the better-known indexes are the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 
500), which aggregates the prices of 500 large American companies; the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average, which tracks 30 very large companies; and the 
Russell 3000, which shows the average price performance of the 3,000 largest 
American public companies.
An index fund is designed to match the performance of one of the indexes, as 
good or as bad as that may be in any given year. To do this, the fund manager 
buys all the securities in the index, matching the proportion of each stock in 
the fund to its proportion in the index.
 
Many general investors love index funds because they’re a low-cost way to 
pick up market performance. They can be problematic for social investors, 
though, because the fund managers buy good and bad companies because 
they need to buy everything that’s included in the index. Nevertheless, there 
are index funds (and exchange-traded funds, which are special types of index 
funds discussed in more detail later in this chapter) that invest in specially 
designed socially responsible indexes or that invest in what’s left of an index 
after offending companies are screened out.
International funds
International funds invest in companies that are based outside of the United 
States. Some funds specialize in certain regions, like Europe, or in certain 
types of markets, such as developing economies.
One class of international funds, known as global funds, invests in the United 
States as well as in other countries. All of these funds may offer exposure to 
higher returns from faster market growth and currency appreciation than 
may be available at home, although they may also have higher risk. This 
gives social investors a broader array of companies to choose from.

225
 Chapter 13: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
Specialty funds
Although the prototypical mutual fund invests in a diversified portfolio of 
stocks, some concentrate on certain market sectors, such as electric utili-
ties, technology, or natural resources. These are known as specialty funds, 
and the fund managers tend to understand their chosen industry better than 
just about anyone else. These funds aren’t diversified, though, so they can be 
riskier.
Some people consider socially responsible funds to be specialty funds 
because they target a narrow investing audience. That’s not strictly accu-
rate, though, because most social funds are willing to look at a broad 
range of stocks as long as they fit within the predetermined social criteria. 
Morningstar (www.morningstar.com), a company that analyzes mutual 
fund performance, sorts social funds into categories based on investments, 
not based on responsibility.
Value funds
The name of the game is buying low and selling high, so many mutual fund 
managers look for stocks that are cheap. The price of a stock may be low 
because the company runs into problems with a product, management 
screws up, or the business is out of favor for some reason. (Because these 
fund managers are often looking at troubled companies, value investing is 
often popular with investors who care about corporate governance, dis-
cussed in Chapter 7.)
Value investing requires a lot of patience while the shareholders wait for the 
company to turn around or for other investors to see how great the business 
really is.
Bond funds
Bonds, which are discussed in Chapter 12, are loans. The issuing company or 
government borrows money from the bond investor when the bond investor 
buys the bond. The bond itself is a contract in which the borrower agrees to 
pay regular interest and then repay the loan, known as the principal, at some 
point in the future. Bond funds combine money from many investors to buy 
bonds. Some bond fund managers buy a wide range of issues, while others 
concentrate in bonds from specific types of issuers or with a target maturity 
date. As with all mutual funds, the advantages of owning a fund instead of a 
bond itself are diversification and professional management.

226
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Bond funds aren’t appropriate for Muslim investors who can’t receive interest, 
but most other social investors can find a bond fund that suits their needs.
Corporate bond funds
Companies need money to grow. They may need to build new warehouses, 
acquire related businesses, or make sure that they meet payroll while wait-
ing for customers to pay. Many companies get the funds they need by issuing 
bonds. The key risk is repayment; if the company goes bankrupt, the bond-
holders may not get back the money that they loaned out.
Just as individual borrowers have their credit scored by a credit bureau, so 
too do corporations receive a score from a rating agency. Higher rated bonds 
have less risk but pay lower interest rates. The least creditworthy are known 
as junk bonds or high-yield bonds, and generally pay the highest interest as an 
incentive to the purchaser to take on the additional risk. Some bond funds 
specialize in bonds with specific ratings.
International bond funds
International bond funds invest in bonds issued by corporations and govern-
ments outside of the United States. (World bond funds invest both inside and 
outside of U.S. borders.) Some international bond funds concentrate on one 
currency or one region, while others focus on either government bonds or 
corporate bonds.
Municipal bond funds
State and local governments often issue bonds to raise money. These are 
known as municipal bonds (often shortened to munis), even if the issuer is a 
state rather than a municipality. To give these issuers a break on the interest 
cost, the federal government exempts the interest income paid to the bond-
holders from federal taxes. Many states offer a similar deal. Municipal bond 
funds usually appeal to individual investors in a high tax bracket. They’re not 
appropriate for tax-advantaged savings plans used for retirement or college.
Some municipal bond funds look for good securities anywhere in the country, 
and others invest in certain states, such as New York or California. State-
specific funds rarely make sense for investors in other states because the tax 
advantage will probably be smaller.
U.S. government bond funds
The U.S. government is the biggest borrower in the world. Although it spends 
more money than it takes in, it’s also considered to be the least risky bor-
rower in the world. After all, it controls printing presses that can be used to 
make money to meet its bills. Hence, many investors looking for safety turn 
to U.S. government bonds, and hundreds of mutual funds can help them with 
their investment. To distinguish themselves from that vast pack, many of the 

227
 Chapter 13: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
funds specialize. For example, some U.S. government bond funds only invest 
in bonds that mature more than ten years into the future, while others spe-
cialize in treasury bills, which mature in just one year.
Along with government debt, the U.S. government backs bonds issued by 
government agencies that guarantee mortgages, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie 
Mac, and Ginnie Mae. Some mutual funds, often known as U.S. government 
securities funds, specialize in these.
Total return funds
The goal of most stock funds is capital gains, while bond funds are usually 
managed for interest income. But what if you want both? The mutual fund 
industry wants to help you! The combo category is total return funds, also 
called balanced funds. These invest in both stocks and bonds, aiming for a 
greater return than is possible with bonds but at less risk than is found in 
most stock funds.
Some total return funds are structured as target funds, also called lifecycle 
funds. These are managed to deliver money at a set future date, usually when 
the fund investor plans to retire. The investment strategy changes over time 
to shift from riskier investments in the earlier years to more conservative 
ones as the target date approaches.
Money market funds
Money market mutual funds are similar to bank accounts in that they are 
managed for a safe return and can often be redeemed simply by writing a 
check. They usually pay a higher rate of interest than a bank account does, 
but they’re not federally insured. These funds invest in uninsured bank CDs 
and short-term corporate and U.S. government securities. You can find out a 
lot more about them in Chapter 14.
Recommended mutual funds 
for social investors
Several mutual fund companies specialize in funds for the socially respon-
sible investor, using different definitions for what makes an investment 
responsible. Here’s a list of some that you can use to start your research. It’s 
hardly definitive, and you may well uncover more funds, and new funds, as 
you do your research. This section has a list of a few of the many mutual fund 
families specializing in different social investing styles.

✓ Amana (www.amanafunds.com): Amana funds are managed to meet 
the standards of Shariah, the requirements followed by Muslims. The 
no-load funds don’t invest in any bonds or stocks of companies involved 
in gambling, pornography, alcohol, or banking; these restrictions make 
them popular with some non-Muslim social investors, too. Amana 
offers two funds, a growth fund and a non-bond income fund. One of 
the company’s more unusual savings programs is one to help people 
save money to make the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca that Muslims are 
expected to make at least once in their lives. Muslims are also expected 
to give a percentage of their gains to charity, and Amana will calculate 
that amount along with income, capital gains, and other investment per-
formance numbers.
 
✓ Ariel (www.arielinvestments.com): Ariel funds have a strong value 
bias, which means the fund managers look for stocks that are cheap. 
They also look for companies that match the firm’s values, as set by 
its founder, John Rogers. Ariel doesn’t invest in companies that pro-
duce tobacco products, handguns, or nuclear power. Instead, it looks 
for undervalued companies that have a strong environmental record, 
are active in their communities, and have hiring practices encouraging 
diversity. Ariel has three no-load mutual funds, and it manages money 
for pensions, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals.
 
✓ Ave Maria (www.avemariafund.com): These no-load mutual funds 
target devout Roman Catholics who don’t want to invest in companies 
that offer goods or services used in abortions or pornography or that 
provide domestic partner benefits. The company offers four equity 
funds, a bond fund, and a money market fund. The fund’s advisory board 
members include former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz and Equal 
Rights Amendment opponent Phyllis Schlafly.
 
✓ Calvert (www.calvert.com): Calvert, founded in 1976, is one of the big-
gest and oldest names in socially responsible investment management. 
The company has a range of mutual funds, manages money for pensions 
and endowments (see Chapter 3 for more on these), and even handles 
microfinance investments (covered in Chapter 17). Its 28 mutual funds 
are sold through brokers and cover just about the full range of risk and 
return possibilities. Calvert analysts look at how companies rate on envi-
ronmental standards, workplace conditions, human rights, indigenous 
peoples’ rights, community relations, product safety and impact, and 
governance/business ethics. The firm also engages in shareholder advo-
cacy, supports community banks and related development programs, 
and invests in early-stage companies developing new products or tech-
nologies that might solve various social ills.

✓ Domini (www.domini.com): Amy Domini started her career as a 
stockbroker who worked with clients who cared about the companies 
that they invested in. In 1984, she wrote a book on the subject (see the 
appendix for more information), and in 1989, she created an index that 
would track the performance of companies that had good records for 
their treatment of employees, customers, communities, the environ-
ment, and shareholders. The Domini 400 Social Index is often used to 
evaluate the performance of social investing relative to the stock market 
as a whole. Those interested in Domini’s style can choose from the com-
pany’s six no-load funds investing in domestic and international equity, 
bonds, and money market securities.
 
✓ GuideStone (www.guidestonefunds.org): These funds are designed 
to follow the precepts of Southern Baptists. GuideStone hires outside 
money managers to invest for the funds; they agree not to invest in any 
company operating in the liquor, tobacco, gambling, pornography, or 
abortion industries or that otherwise behaves in ways that would be 
antithetical to members of the Southern Baptist Convention. GuideStone 
offers 24 no-load stock and bond funds with a mix of investment objec-
tives. One interesting offering is an S&P 500 index fund with only 486 
stocks in it, designed to match the performance of the index without 
buying companies in the index that don’t meet GuideStone’s social 
restrictions. There’s no Anheuser-Busch (NYSE: BUD) for you!
 
✓ New Covenant (www.newcovenantfunds.com): New Covenant funds 
are affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA) and don’t invest 
money in shares of defense contractors, distillers of alcoholic bever-
ages, tobacco companies, gambling companies, manufacturers of gam-
bling equipment, and manufacturers of firearms. The funds instead 
prefer companies that treat employees well, support customers and 
their communities, and have a good environmental record. Among other 
features, New Covenant offers a program that lets investors use their 
mutual fund to fund their philanthropy, directing their profits to their 
church or other charities. The company has five mutual funds, all of 
which are sold at no load.
 
✓ Parnassus (www.parnassus.com): The investment staff at Parnassus 
starts by ruling out businesses that manufacture tobacco or alcohol, are 
engaged in gambling, manufacture weapons, or produce nuclear energy. 
With what’s left over, they look for companies that protect the environ-
ment, respect employees, promote diversity, contribute to their com-
munities, and do business ethically. The company has six no-load funds. 
One, the Parnassus Workplace Fund, specializes in companies that are 
recognized as great places to work.

230

✓ Pax World (www.paxworld.com): Pax World looks for companies that 
are all-around good. The company’s two no-load funds aren’t directly 
affiliated with the United Methodist Church, but the company’s founders 
came out of that tradition. The fund’s managers use a long list of social 
criteria to choose investments, including environmental performance, 
workplace conditions, corporate governance, product integrity, and 
community relations. Pax World’s managers use proxies and other forms 
of shareholder activism to press companies for change, and they’re 
committed to community economic development.
 
✓ Timothy Plan (www.timothyplan.com): Timothy Plan operates a 
series of ten mutual funds, sold with a load through financial advisors, 
aimed at conservative Christians of any denomination. The funds don’t 
invest in companies that produce alcohol, tobacco, or pornography; that 
are involved in gambling, abortion, or impure entertainment; or that sup-
port gay rights. Timothy Plan offers variable and charitable gift annuities 
(discussed in Chapter 14) that follow the same investment principles. 
The company’s Web site includes a referral form if you’re looking for a 
financial planner who supports these investing principles.
Working with Exchange-Traded Funds
An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is a fund that is traded on a stock exchange. 
Like mutual funds, they are regulated under the Investment Company Act of 
1940, but they operate very differently. They are relatively new, with the first 
ETF coming to market in 1993.
Shares of these funds can be bought or sold at any time during the trading 
day by using a broker. The company that organizes the ETF joins forces with 
different institutional investor and trading firms. Those firms buy all the 
securities in the index, and then either sell shares in the ETF to others or 
hold them for their own accounts.
The price of each share of the ETF should track the performance of the index 
that it’s based on, but it can also vary with supply and demand for the ETF 
itself. If the price of a share in the ETF falls below where it should be, the 
institutions that bought the securities to create the ETF can go to the spon-
soring organization and exchange ETF shares for the underlying securities, 
then sell the securities themselves, locking in a neat low-risk profit. This is a 
key difference between an ETF and its closest sibling, the closed-end mutual 
fund (see the section earlier in the chapter for more on these). It gives the 
institutions an incentive to participate and helps keep the ETF shares trading 
at prices in line with the value of the underlying index.
Because ETFs invest in stocks and bonds, you can find more in Chapter 12 
about how they get their returns.

231
 Chapter 13: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
 
Although the first ETFs were based on such long-standing and commonly used 
indexes as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, newer indexes 
are designed all the time to track very narrow market sectors or investor con-
cerns. This way, new ETFs can be developed to meet new investor interests, 
nearly matching the array of specialized and sector mutual funds.
The big advantage of an ETF is that investors can buy or sell during the day 
to take advantage of short-term market changes. This makes them attractive 
to day traders. Another advantage is that ETFs can be sold short (borrowing 
shares from a broker and then selling them) for those who want to bet that 
an index will go down in value, or they can be bought on margin (money bor-
rowed from the broker). Finally, ETFs are available on currencies and com-
modities that may be difficult for an individual investor to buy otherwise.
 
For lots more information about exchange-traded funds, consider Exchange-
Traded Funds For Dummies (Wiley).
Exchange-traded funds are popular with many fund investors because they 
offer a lot of trading flexibility. They can also be cheap to operate, leaving 
more money for investors when all is said and done.
Unlike with mutual funds, there is no family of exchange-traded funds that 
specializes in socially responsible funds to the exclusion of all others. 
However, many ETFs appeal to different social investing styles. If you can 
accept that the sponsor wants to reach a range of investor issues, then read 
on for more information about buying, selling, and owning these funds.
Fees and expenses
ETFs tend to be cheap because index funds are cheap to manage. The com-
pany that develops the index does all the work of figuring out what should go 
into it and in what proportion, so the ETF firm simply has to match that. It’s 
not unusual for an ETF to charge 0.10 percent or less of assets for manage-
ment services, compared to 1.00 percent or more at many mutual funds.
However, to meet the demand for ETFs, new indexes are being developed 
that aren’t exactly simple. The first ETFs were on well-known indexes like 
the S&P 500. Now, there are ETFs that specialize only in solar or wind power, 
or in intellectual property, or in value stocks. The more work that goes into 
developing and managing the underlying index, the higher the fees that will be 
charged. The narrower the ETF’s niche, the more likely it is to have high fees.
Although ETFs charge management fees, they don’t charge 12b-1 fees, the 
bane of many a mutual fund investor, nor do they charge sales loads. However, 
they can only be purchased and sold through a brokerage firm. Many brokers 
charge low commissions, sometimes as low at $10, to buy or sell an ETF.

232
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Buying ETFs
ETFs can only be purchased through brokerage firms, although these firms 
vary widely in services and costs offered. Chapter 12 contains some informa-
tion about this. These firms charge a commission or transaction fee each 
time an ETF is bought or sold, and some charge account service fees, too. To 
buy or sell an ETF, you simply call your broker or go to the firm’s Web site 
and place an order.
When you buy shares of an ETF, or of any stock, you are said to be long. 
When you sell, you are short. It’s possible to sell shares you don’t own if you 
believe that the price is going to go down, and this is a crucial difference 
between an ETF and a mutual fund. To short an ETF, you borrow shares from 
the broker (for which the broker will charge a fee), and then sell those bor-
rowed shares. Eventually, you’ll have to buy shares in the ETF to repay the 
loan; if the repurchase price is below where you sold those borrowed shares, 
you can keep the difference as a profit.
 
Shorting is risky, because you have to repay the loan no matter what the ETF 
price does. In theory, a security can go up infinitely, leaving the short seller 
with infinite losses. Don’t short anything unless you can afford to lose the 
money.
 
Don’t short an industry just because you don’t like it. For example, if you 
believe that entertainment companies encourage excessive consumption and 
immoral lifestyles and are run by people who care about their own power 
and perks rather than shareholder value, you may be thinking about short-
ing something like the Power Shares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment 
ETF (Amex: PEJ). The problem is that even though you don’t like an industry 
doesn’t mean everyone else will shun it, too. You’ll be short, they’ll keep 
buying, and you’ll lose a ton of money. Yikes! You’re better off being affirma-
tive, buying what you like rather than betting against what you don’t.
ETF shares can be purchased on margin, which is a loan made by the broker-
age firm (for a fee). Margin allows you to buy more shares in the ETF than 
you would be able to otherwise. This is great if the ETF goes up in value, and 
not so good if it goes down. After all, the brokerage firm will expect you to 
repay the loan no matter what happens.
ETFs trade throughout the day, so your purchase or sale will take place when 
the broker executes the order. This may be more or less than the price at the 
end of the day. For a long-term investor, this shouldn’t be an issue one way 
or the other. For a short-term investor or a day trader, this can create oppor-
tunities for better profits.

233
 Chapter 13: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
Tax considerations
ETFs don’t pay taxes themselves. Instead, any tax liabilities that the fund 
generates are passed along to investors, who then settle up with the IRS. In 
general, the ETF itself will have few tax liabilities, but a fund can post losses 
or gains when the securities in the underlying index change, often due to a 
company being acquired. This means that the fund has to sell the old secu-
rity and buy the new one, triggering a capital gain for taxable investors.
The object of your ETF affection
ETFs don’t come in nearly as many shapes and sizes as open-ended mutual 
funds, but the situation is changing rapidly. ETFs have become so popular 
with investors that new indexes are being developed specifically so inves-
tors will be able to find ETFs to meet their every need. The following sections 
offer handy descriptions of the major ETF categories to give you a sense of 
how you can use them in your investment portfolio.
Broad domestic equity
Once upon a time, all ETFs were in this category, which consists of funds 
that invest in a wide range of larger U.S. companies. After all, the ETFs were 
tied to the major stock market indexes, and they remain popular. (These 
early ETFs include SPDRs, for S&P Depository Receipts, on the S&P 500, 
and Diamonds, for Dow Jones Industrial Trust, on the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average.)
The traditional equity index ETF invests in too many different companies to 
be thought of as socially responsible. However, a handful of broad domestic 
equity ETFs invest in socially responsible indexes, which consist of a large, 
diverse array of companies that meet some predetermined criteria.
Sector domestic equity
A sector equity ETF invests in a group of stocks from a single industry or with 
a single investment strategy. For example, an investor may be interested in 
solar power, but that industry is so new that it may be difficult to select any 
one stock. An ETF on the solar industry invests in several different compa-
nies, reducing the risk of investing in any one.
Likewise, ETF investors who care about value stocks or growth stocks or 
technology companies can find ETFs that fit those objectives. This gives 
them the advantages of focused mutual funds with the flexibility of the ETF 
structure. Some may fit nicely into a set of social restrictions, too.

234
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Global and international equity
U.S. investors took to U.S. ETFs almost immediately, and then they started 
looking for ways to use the ETF structure to invest overseas. Voilá! New ETFs 
were introduced to invest in stocks of companies around the world. Some of 
these ETFs invest in specific markets, such as Europe or China. Others invest in 
industries such as pharmaceuticals that are multinational in scope, so the lead-
ing companies are located all over the world. These ETFs make it easy to pick 
up exposure to international markets with good diversification to reduce risk.
Bonds
ETFs trade as shares of stock, but it’s possible to buy ETFs on bonds. These 
funds invest in a portfolio of bonds designed to match the performance of 
a bond index. Although they’re not as well known as the big stock market 
indexes, several indexes measure the performance of different sectors of the 
bond market.
Buyers of these ETFs end up with a diversified array of bonds to help them 
better weather interest rate and credit risks; they pay regular interest, too. 
Depending on one’s social style, these can fit in many activist portfolios.
Specialty
Specialty ETFs invest in assets that can be difficult for smaller investors to 
get exposure to otherwise, such as commodities and currencies. These funds 
invest in futures contracts, which trade based on the underlying value of the 
asset, so the fund holder can invest in agriculture, precious metals, or the 
Australian dollar simply by purchasing shares of the ETF.
These funds have made it far easier for individual investors to diversify their 
assets. Because these sectors tend to be socially neutral, they may be appro-
priate in a socially responsible portfolio. As with any investment, do your 
research first to make sure the fund matches your social concerns.
Selecting socially responsible ETFs
If you are interested in socially responsible investing through exchange-
traded funds, here’s a list of several to check out. Consider it a starting point; 
new ETFs come on the market all the time, while others are pulled if the 
sponsor doesn’t find enough interest from investors.
 
✓ Claymore/MAC Global Solar ETF (NYSE: TAN): Solar power combines 
clean energy and support for new businesses and technologies, both 
themes of interest to many social investors. This ETF tracks the MAC 
Global Solar Index, which tracks 25 companies from around the world 
that are developing products and technologies to make solar power 
viable.

235
 Chapter 13: Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
 
✓ Claymore/Ocean Tomo Patent (NYSE: OTP): Many investors are 
inspired by the opportunity to be part of emerging technologies that 
can change the world for the better. Ocean Tomo, an investment bank 
that specializes in deals involving patents and intellectual property, cre-
ated the Ocean Tomo 300 Index to track the 300 companies that have 
the most valuable patents relative to the book value of their assets. 
Claymore’s ETF lets investors get exposure to all 300 companies in one 
transaction.
 
✓ Claymore/S&P Global Water Index (NYSE: CGW): Water is a huge con-
cern for both the sustainability of the planet and the economic health of 
certain regions. The S&P Global Water Index measures the performance 
of 50 companies that supply water quality equipment and materials or 
that operate water utilities and related infrastructure. No one can make 
more water, and it’s necessary for life, so this ETF may appeal to people 
who want to profit from improvements in water quality.
 
✓ iShares MSCI USA Islamic (London: ISUS): A handful of Shariah-
compliant ETFs are on the market, but none trade in the United States 
as of this writing. However, most brokerage firms make it easy to trade 
overseas, and it doesn’t hurt that the New York Stock Exchange owns 
the Euronext Exchange. Hence, this fund is an option for an investor 
interested in Islamic principles and exchange-traded funds. It is based 
on the Morgan Stanley Capital International USA Islamic index of major 
U.S. companies whose business practices meet Islamic law.
 
✓ First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge U.S. Liquid Series ETF (NASDAQ: 
QCLN): The Clean Edge index invests in companies that develop 
advanced materials, energy management technologies, energy storage 
systems, or renewable energy. The liquid in this index’s name has noth-
ing to do with fuel; instead, it consists of stocks that are listed on the 
U.S. exchanges and have enough shares outstanding that they trade 
easily. This ETF may make sense for investors who care about energy 
and the environment.
 
✓ iShares KLD 400 Social Index Fund (NYSE: DSI): The Domini 400 index 
is possibly the oldest and best-known index of socially responsible 
companies; those who want to invest in it can use this ETF. It consists of 
250 large, 100 medium, and 50 small companies that aren’t involved in 
alcohol, tobacco, firearms, gambling, nuclear power, and military weap-
ons but that do have strong, positive records on community relations, 
diversity, employee relations, human rights, product quality and safety, 
environment, and corporate governance.
 
✓ iShares KLD Select Social Index Fund (NYSE: KLD): The KLD Select 
Social Index measures the performance of companies that have similar 
characteristics to those in the Russell 1000 (the 1,000 largest American 
stocks) or the S&P 500 (an index of 500 large companies). If you’re look-
ing to invest in companies with strong environmental and social perfor-
mance while avoiding those involved with tobacco, check out this ETF.

236

✓ PowerShares Cleantech Portfolio (AMEX: PZD): The Cleantech Index is 
used to evaluate the performance of 75 companies that are using tech-
nology to find alternative sources of energy, use energy more efficiently, 
purify air and water, grow crops in environmentally friendly fashions, 
and otherwise contribute to a cleaner planet. This ETF lets investors 
profit — or not — along with these companies.
 
✓ Power-Shares WilderHill Clean Energy Portfolio (AMEX: PBW): 
Concerned about carbon? Want to make money from the transition 
to cleaner energy? Then this ETF may be the right one for you. The 
WilderHill Clean Energy Index invests in companies that produce or will 
profit from clean energy and energy conservation. It holds a mix of battery 
producers, solar companies, biofuel producers, and related businesses.
 
✓ Van Eck Market Vectors Environmental Services (AMEX: EVX): Some 
environmental businesses are dedicated to preventing future problems 
by developing new technologies and commercializing alternative fuels. 
Others are dedicated to evaluating and cleaning up messes, which may 
be of interest to investors who care about the environment and com-
munity redevelopment. This ETF is based on the Amex Environmental 
Services Index, which is made up of publicly traded companies that 
handle consumer waste disposal, removal and storage of industrial 
byproducts, and the management of soil and water.

Banking on Social Responsibility 
(and Insuring It, Too)
In This Chapter
▶ Saving your money locally
▶ Analyzing annuity options
▶ Policing your insurance policies
▶ Facing the challenges of socially responsible borrowing
S
ocial investing isn’t limited to stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. After all, 
even your little federally insured bank savings account paying low inter-
est is invested in something, but what? Is it an investment that supports your 
goals and values?
You can make socially responsible investment choices with more conserva-
tive parts of your portfolio, including cash and insurance, and that’s what 
this chapter is about. You can also find socially responsible options for loans, 
because most of us need to borrow money at some point. Even if you’re 
opposed to interest and think of insurance as a form of gambling, the ever-
creative financial services industry has figured out a way to help you meet 
your financial goals.
In this chapter, I cover banks, banking alternatives, and insurance. After you 
know more about the role of banks, you may decide to move your CDs and 
money market investments to accounts at a community development finan-
cial institution. You may find new sources of funds that your church can use 
to finance its much-needed new roof. Or you may decide that you just want to 
buy stock in the bank itself. Any option is fine; many social investors find that 
there are a lot of different ways to invest after they clarify their goals.

Stashing Your Cash Socially
Nowadays it seems like all banks are merging into one or two humongous 
international institutions that have no interest in small customers, except to 
collect their ATM fees. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were banks that still cared 
about the community?
Well, there are a lot of community banks out there, but they don’t have 
Midtown Manhattan skyscrapers, they don’t bail out hedge funds, and they 
probably don’t even advertise on TV. Instead, they collect deposits from 
people in their area who are looking for checking and savings accounts, and 
then they lend the money to neighborhood homeowners, small businesses, 
and community institutions. These community banks really are like the build-
ing and loan in Frank Capra’s 1946 movie It’s a Wonderful Life, but without the 
suicide attempt and the incompetent Uncle Billy.
Work at a community bank isn’t nearly as glamorous as it is at the go-go, high 
finance, global household-name bank. But what it lacks in gloss it makes up 
for in social responsibility. Many community banks provide financial services 
to underserved populations, work closely with small businesses and non-
profit institutions to help them expand responsibly, and develop better hous-
ing to reduce blight and keep people committed to their neighborhood. They 
collect deposits from people in the community and elsewhere who want to 
earn a safe, federally insured return and make a difference at the same time.
 
That’s not to say that the mega-banks can’t be socially responsible. Many of 
the country’s largest banks are improving their environmental, governance, 
and sustainability standards (see Chapters 7 and 8 for more on these stan-
dards). Not only do they trumpet their accomplishments on their Web sites 
and in advertisements, but they also have to meet federal requirements for 
community performance. Under the Fair Housing Act, banks may not discrimi-
nate on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, 
or handicap when customers apply for a mortgage; under the Community 
Reinvestment Act, banks must show how they’re lending in their communities, 
and that information is rated by the relevant reporting agencies. You can look 
up a bank’s status at www.ffiec.gov/cra/ratings.htm.
With most banks, you have no idea how your deposit is invested. Banks 
use deposit money to back home loans and commercial loans, or to invest 
in certain types of bonds (generally U.S. government securities and agency 
mortgage-backed securities; they are highly regulated institutions backed 
with federal deposit insurance, and only a few specific types of outside 
investments are allowed). Some banks offer linked deposits, in which the 
money in your savings account or CD will be used for predefined types of 
loans, ranging from agriculture to community redevelopment, but most 
banks won’t tell you where your money is going.

239
 Chapter 14: Banking on Social Responsibility (and Insuring It, Too)
That being said, three types of banks may be of particular interest to inves-
tors with a social style:
 
✓ Community development financial institutions (CDFIs), which commit to 
investing in up-and-coming neighborhoods
 
✓ Credit unions, which collect deposits from and make loans to a specific 
group of people
 
✓ Small Business Administration (SBA) lenders, which specialize in loans 
to emerging businesses
I explain each of these types of banks in the following sections.
 
Before getting excited about the different types of banks where you can hold 
responsible cash investments, remember your long-term financial goals. Bank 
accounts rarely offer a return that beats inflation. If you’re like most people, 
a bank account should contain only a small amount of your total assets — 
enough for an emergency fund or money toward a big expenditure that you 
plan to make in a year or two. Of course, your situation may be very different.
CDFIs: A little help from the Feds
The U.S. Treasury Department regulates U.S. banks, and it has a special cat-
egory of financial institution known as a community development financial 
institution, or CDFI. These banks are committed to the economic development 
of the communities they serve.
Most were founded as parts of urban renewal programs in the late 1960s and 
early 1970s to provide mortgages to homeowners who wanted to stay in their 
neighborhoods even as the big commercial banks were pulling out for the sub-
urbs, leaving no local lenders. By 1994, Congress created the CDFI Fund to sup-
port the activities of these banks and their community development partners.
A CDFI accepts checking, CD, and savings account deposits from interested 
investors, and then it uses the money to make loans to homeowners, real 
estate developers, small businesses, churches, and nonprofit organizations in 
the community.
Many CDFIs even take deposits from major banks that want to participate in 
economic development (and earn credit toward meeting their Community 
Reinvestment Act requirements — it counts!). Depositors don’t have to be 
located in the neighborhood; many of these banks will happily open a savings 
or CD account for an investor on the other side of the country who’s looking 
for an investment that supports community development. CDFIs participate 
in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), so deposits are insured 
against loss.

240

You can find a list of banks that participate in the CDFI program at the 
Coalition of Community Development Financial Institutions Web site, www.
cdfi.org. Some may even be where you live!
Earning credit at a credit union
A credit union is a nonprofit cooperative organization that works more or less 
like a bank. The members pool their savings for deposits and then lend the 
money to those who need it. In general, credit unions pay higher interest on 
deposits and charge lower interest on loans than traditional banks. Deposits 
are insured up to $100,000 by the National Credit Union Administration 
(NCUA), a federal agency.
Most credit unions are affiliated with large employers, but some are designed 
to draw customers from within community boundaries. The goal of commu-
nity development credit unions is to provide easy access to financial services 
that help a community grow.
Often founded by churches or community activist groups, credit unions usu-
ally offer financial education in addition to low-cost services. Their services 
range from traditional checking, savings, and mortgage products to such spe-
cialized loans as payday advances, which are loans with a term of just a few 
days to a week used by people who run out of money before they get paid.
Needless to say, a community development credit union charges much lower 
rates and fees on these advances than for-profit storefront payday lenders, 
which often charge annual percentage rates approaching 300 percent! These 
alternative services aren’t of interest to traditional banks, but they can really 
help people who are skating on the edge of solvency. (I hope that’s not you.)
 
You can find information about community development credit unions at the 
National Federation of Community Credit Unions Web site, www.natfed.org. 
It not only includes a directory that you can use to find a credit union near 
you, but it also has information on investment opportunities for people looking 
to take more risk by helping community development credit unions expand.
Taking care of (small) business
Small businesses drive economic growth in many communities. In this very 
book you hold in your hands, I have one chapter on community development 
in general that discusses them (see Chapter 6), and another on microfinance, 
which is the process of providing very small loans to people in impoverished 
countries (see Chapter 17).

241
 Chapter 14: Banking on Social Responsibility (and Insuring It, Too)
But what do you do if you want to support small-business investment or if 
you want to take out a small-business loan yourself? You go to a bank that 
is a certified small-business lender with the Small Business Administration 
(SBA, www.sba.gov). The standard loan program is called 7A; applicants 
work with participating local banks to borrow money.
Most commercial banks participate, but you can find the names of some near 
you by checking with your local SBA office. A directory is on the SBA Web 
site. You can make deposits with these banks to help support their financing 
activities. The more money on account, the more a bank can lend.
Shariah Banking
Islam is guided by a set of laws known as Shariah. It forbids its followers from 
charging or paying interest (Chapter 10 has more details on Shariah). That’s 
okay for most ventures because Muslims usually can find acceptable alterna-
tives: leasing a car, using a debit card or writing checks, working through col-
lege, taking on a business partner.
Buying real estate is tough though. It’s hard to save up enough money for a 
house while also paying rent, but there may not be many suitable places to 
rent in the town where you want to live. Financing arrangements are avail-
able, though, and they include:
 
✓ Murabaha financing: This is cost-plus financing. The bank buys the 
house from the seller and then resells it to the prospective homeowner 
at a price that reflects the bank’s costs of carrying it for several years. 
The homeowner repays the bank with a fixed payment each month.
 
✓ Ijara financing: Ijara is a lease-to-own arrangement. The bank buys the 
property and then rents it back to the occupants for a set number of 
years. At the end of the period, the occupants take the title to the prop-
erty, in some cases after paying an additional but very low purchase 
price. Because the lease terms can be reset over the life of the loan, this 
can be similar to an adjustable-rate mortgage.
 
✓ Musharaka financing: In this arrangement, the homeowner and the bank 
buy the property together, and the homeowner then pays rent to the 
bank for the use of the bank’s stake. With each payment, the homeowner 
also buys a small portion of the bank’s share and eventually owns the 
whole property.
These arrangements are usually a little more expensive than a traditional 
American mortgage, so a non-Muslim would probably not be interested.

242
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
One of the largest providers of Shariah mortgages in the United States is 
Devon Bank (www.devonbank.com; pronounced de-vonn and not like the 
county in England), which developed the products in response to changing 
neighborhood demographics. The bank is in Chicago’s West Rogers Park 
neighborhood, which was once solidly Jewish. The area is now home to 
Indians and Pakistanis, many of whom were first attracted to the neighbor-
hood by the presence of kosher butchers.
Devon Bank provides real estate financing to Muslims in 31 states; it has com-
petition in some markets as other banks see just how popular these products 
can be.
 
It’s difficult to find Shariah-compliant bank accounts in the United States 
because of the prohibition on receiving interest, but it’s not impossible. 
University Bank (www.universityislamicfinancial.com) in Ann Arbor, 
Michigan, has developed federally insured profit-sharing accounts that are 
similar to traditional bank accounts, but they invest directly in properties 
financed though ijara or murabaha arrangements, rather than in the loans 
themselves.
Mixing in Some Money Market Funds
The key advantage of bank savings accounts is that they carry federal deposit 
insurance of up to $100,000. If the bank fails, you get your money back. But in 
exchange, banks tend to offer the lowest interest rates in the market.
One alternative to a bank savings account is a money market mutual fund. 
These accounts are offered by mutual fund companies that invest your 
money in such very short-term, low-risk securities as U.S. treasury bills, 
jumbo bank CDs (which are too large to qualify for federal deposit insur-
ance), and bonds that are about to mature. Most of the securities have a time 
horizon of one month or less, so there are few unknowns that trip up inves-
tors. Any major American company may be bankrupt in 50 years, but how 
many will go under without warning in the next 25 days?
Given the nature of the investments, there are few opportunities not to be 
socially responsible. Unless you don’t believe in receiving interest, don’t 
want to fund the federal government any more than you already do with 
taxes, or have deep concerns about the banks that issue the CDs, you’re 
probably okay with almost any of the thousands of money market funds out 
there. And, in fact, most of the money market funds that bill themselves as 
socially responsible simply invest in U.S. government securities, making the 
investment decision nice and easy.

243
 Chapter 14: Banking on Social Responsibility (and Insuring It, Too)
But many investors want social benefits from their investments, and that’s 
what this book is about. A handful of money market mutual funds have a ded-
icated, socially responsible investment style. They are mostly affiliated with 
mutual fund companies that organize all of their investing around a social or 
activist theme.
For example, the Timothy Plan (www.timothyplan.com) offers mutual 
funds for conservative Christians who don’t want their money invested in 
companies that produce pornography, support gambling, or otherwise oper-
ate in markets that are counter to their values. The money market fund car-
ries that position through to its choice of corporate bonds that supplement 
the government securities and bank CD holdings.
 
Money market mutual funds aren’t federally insured, but they rarely fail, 
either. Because most are affiliated with larger mutual fund companies, the 
companies have been self-insured against losses in those very few cases 
where a problem emerges. To do otherwise means a horrible loss in reputa-
tion and business, because investors assume that only the worst investment 
managers could lose money in the money market. The fund company’s manag-
ers would rather pay out of the firm’s profits than see that happen.
 
Some of the many mutual fund companies offering dedicated socially respon-
sible money market mutual funds are
 
✓ Ave Maria (www.avemariafund.com)
 
✓ Calvert (www.calvertgroup.com)
 
✓ Domini (www.domini.com)
 
✓ Sentinel (www.sentinelinvestments.com)

panies in Chapter 13.
Shifting Your Savings into Annuities
An annuity is a long-term contract that guarantees a payment over a set 
future time period. For example, you might buy an annuity today to pay you 
$10,000 per year for the next 20 years. When the time is up, you don’t get 
any more money. Some annuities are based on your remaining years of 
expected life, which is a nice deal if you live as long as — or longer than — 
the insurance company expects.

244
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
If you want to supplement your retirement income or bridge your finances 
between an early retirement and the day you become eligible for Social 
Security, then an annuity may be right for you. Also, if you work for a non-
profit organization or government agency, your employee retirement plan 
may be in the form of an annuity.
Annuities are usually offered by life insurance companies and sometimes 
include a death benefit that pays out if you die before you collect a given per-
centage of the money paid in. To some extent, an annuity is a cross between 
a mutual fund and a life insurance policy, and many of them have socially 
responsible investment alternatives. For more detailed information, you can 
check out Annuities For Dummies by Kerry Pechter (Wiley). Here, though, I 
give you the basics.
Examining fixed and variable annuities
Annuities come in two flavors, fixed and variable. A fixed annuity pays a set 
amount of money each time period, while a variable annuity pays a fixed 
number of units (kind of like shares), but each unit can vary in price. So if 
your annuity pays you 1,000 units per year, and the units fluctuate in value 
between $8.50 and $12.00, then your receipts can vary between $8,500 and 
$12,000. Because of the potential for appreciation, variable annuities may be 
a good choice for long-term retirement savings.
In a retirement plan, employees may be able to choose between a fixed 
annuity and a group of variable annuities with different investment options, 
including some with a socially responsible investment style.
Most of the annuities on the market are deferred. That is, you purchase them 
now, but they don’t start paying off until several years into the future. If you 
pay into an annuity over time, say every month between now and the day you 
retire, you may be able to accumulate a nice chunk of savings. An annuity 
that starts paying from the get-go is called an immediate annuity. Investors 
often buy them when they receive a lump sum of money, such as a payout 
from a 401(k) plan or other type of pension.
Some of the many annuity companies with socially responsible options 
include:
 
✓ AIG Retirement (www.aigretirement.com)
 
✓ Thrivent (www.thrivent.com)
 
✓ TIAA-CREF (www.tiaa-cref.org)

245
 Chapter 14: Banking on Social Responsibility (and Insuring It, Too)
 
If your employer uses annuities in its retirement plan and you’d like to see a 
socially responsible option, ask your human resources department if one can 
be added. Because many annuity companies contract with outside mutual 
fund companies for their investment options, you may find that the annuity 
vendor in place offers such a plan.
Managing fixed annuities
Fixed annuities are managed by the insurance company, and they rarely 
come in socially responsible versions. That’s because the insurance com-
pany is taking all the risk of payment, and it usually wants the flexibility to 
invest anywhere to offset the risk.
Managing variable annuities
With a variable annuity, your payment changes with market conditions. 
Because you take on the risk of the amount to be received, the insurance 
company offers a wide range of options. With many annuity contracts, the 
funds are invested in affiliated mutual funds (which you can read more about 
in Chapter 13). And because you get to choose the fund, many variable annu-
ity companies offer a socially responsible fund for your investing pleasure.
 
Variable annuities and whole life insurance policies (discussed later in the 
chapter) pay big commissions to the agents who sell them, and some unethi-
cal agents have been known to push them on people for whom they’re not 
appropriate. Make sure you understand the expenses involved and the bene-
fits to you before you sign on the dotted line. Most investors should maximize 
the contributions to their IRA and employer retirement plans before consider-
ing an annuity or whole life policy.
Using annuities for charity
Many investors want to get a tax deduction for a donation they make now to 
charity, but they also want to receive some income. For example, maybe you 
sell your house right before you retire in order to move to a smaller place, 
and you have a taxable gain on the sale. Because you’re nearing retirement, 
you want to generate a little bit of income. If you make a donation to a non-
profit in the form of a charitable remainder annuity trust, also called a chari-
table gift annuity, you can get both the tax deduction and the income.
Here’s how it works: The charity takes the money today. In exchange, it gives 
you an annuity that pays a regular amount of money each year until you die, 
with the rate based on your age and current market rates. You can deduct 
most of your contribution, but not all of it; you’ll pay taxes on some of your 

246
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
annual payment, but not all of it, either. If you contribute $250,000 and the 
interest rate is 3 percent, then you’ll receive $7,500 per year. Meanwhile, your 
favorite organization can use the money now.
Many universities and larger charitable organizations offer these annuities 
as a service to their donors, as a way to meet everyone’s needs. If you’re 
interested in owning one of these annuities, call the development office at the 
charity of your choice. If it doesn’t have a charitable gift annuity offering, you 
may be able to set one up with the help of your insurance agent.
Whether a charitable gift annuity makes sense for you depends on your tax 
situation and how much savings you already have. For many people, it’s a 
nice way to combine a donation with retirement income.
Investigating Insurance Policies
One reason people save money is to have protection in case something goes 
wrong in the future. Another way to get protection is through insurance, 
whether it be on your house, car, or other property, your health, or even 
your life. Insurance isn’t an investment, but it is an important part of your 
total financial plan.
Insurance companies are, at heart, investment companies, and they’re enor-
mous. The Insurance Working Group of the United Nations’ Environment 
Programme Finance Initiative reports that insurance is the largest single 
industry in the world, collecting $3.4 trillion in premiums each year and man-
aging $16.6 trillion in assets. Those assets form the greatest issue for social 
investors: Just where does all of that money go?
But there are other issues too, including how insurance companies work with 
customers to manage risk and how they treat folks who make claims. I cover 
these topics in the following sections.
Following the money: How insurance 
companies invest
The insurance company starts its investment process by trying to figure out 
just how many claims it’s likely to have in a given year, and it compares that 
to expected revenue.
For example, Allstate Insurance reports that its customers average one 
accident every ten years (you can blame the other, not-so-skilled drivers 
for these crashes). In effect, an auto insurance policy is a kind of forced sav-
ings account that takes into consideration the likelihood of an accident and 

247
 Chapter 14: Banking on Social Responsibility (and Insuring It, Too)
the value of your car. The annual premium is more or less one-tenth of the 
expected cost of the accident you’re probably going to have. If you buy a 
more expensive car, the cost of an accident goes up; if you have a bad driving 
record, the insurance company expects you to get into accidents a little more 
frequently. In both situations, you pay more for your premium.
Because the insurance company knows it will probably have to pay out on 
each driver that it insures once every ten years or so, it puts the money in 
relatively safe, short-term securities, most likely U.S. government notes and 
corporate notes that mature within the next ten years. This way, the insur-
ance company can match the time frame of its claims with the time frame of 
its investments to get a good return while reducing its risk.
Other types of insurance companies have other types of time horizons:
 
✓ People with health insurance tend to file claims almost constantly, so 
the money from premiums is probably invested mostly in cash and 
money market securities.
 
✓ A homeowner may have very few claims over the course of owning a 
house, and these can range from relatively small, like the loss of several 
bicycles during a garage break-in, to the really large, such as a total loss 
of the house and contents due to fire.
 
✓ Life insurance will pay off just once, if it doesn’t expire before you die; 
the insurance company has a pretty good idea of how long you’re going 
to live.
With homeowners and life insurance policies, the insurance companies often 
assume that many of the policies won’t pay out for decades, so the compa-
nies feel comfortable investing a portion of assets in riskier and long-term 
investments, including real estate, timber, and hedge funds.
Measuring an insurance company’s 
social responsibility
It may be difficult or impossible to find out what an insurance company 
invests in, but that’s only one measure of social responsibility. Other mea-
sures include how the company treats people who make claims and how it 
helps customers manage risks.
Satisfactory customer service
For many people, the ethics of insurance companies isn’t related to how the 
assets are invested; it’s in how people are treated when they file a claim. The 
customer is paying for coverage when the accident inevitably happens, but 
the insurance company doesn’t want to see its profit go away. There’s some 
constant tension there.

248
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
 
One way to get a sense of how insurance companies handle claims is to check 
out their ratings at J.D. Power & Associates, a customer research firm: www.
jdpower.com/insurance.
Responsible risk reduction
Insurance companies have three ways to reduce risk. From most responsible 
to least, they can
 
✓ Work with their customers to reduce risks
 
✓ Refuse to cover people who are likely to make claims
 
✓ Refuse to pay claims
 
It’s illegal for insurance companies to refuse to pay a legitimate claim, but 
that doesn’t mean they don’t try. After Hurricane Katrina, many homeown-
ers’ insurance companies tried to argue that the damage to their customers’ 
homes was due to flooding, which is generally not covered under homeowners 
policies, instead of due to wind damage or looting, which is. A quick search of 
news stories can tell you how companies that you’re thinking of investing in or 
doing business with approach these disasters.
 
Helping customers reduce risk and make responsible decisions often has the 
biggest payoff for the customer, the insurance company, and society as a 
whole. This can be as simple as offering discounts for drivers of cars with side 
airbags, because those reduce the risk of death in an accident.
On a broader scale, insurance companies can help big corporations reduce 
their current risks and long-term liabilities by helping them offset carbon 
emissions, protect their employees if they are operating near a war zone, and 
develop products that are safer for customers to use. After all, they provide 
liability insurance to corporations against problems like these.
The Insurance Working Group of the United Nations’ Environment 
Programme Finance Initiative brings together major global insurance com-
panies that are trying to identify future risks in order to start preventing or 
reversing them before they become big problems. It’s a responsible approach 
that should pay off in a better world for everyone, including the shareholders 
of the forward-thinking insurance companies.
If you want to find out who’s involved in these initiatives, you can look at the 
working group’s Web site, www.unepfi.org; companies that are trying to 
do the right thing now tend to talk about it a lot on their corporate Web sites 
and in marketing materials.

249
 Chapter 14: Banking on Social Responsibility (and Insuring It, Too)
Aligning your insurance policies 
with your social beliefs
When insurance companies talk about personal lines, they’re referring to the 
types of insurance that individuals purchase most often:
 
✓ The property-casualty lines of auto and homeowners insurance
 
✓ Health insurance
 
✓ Life insurance
The social issues vary with type, and I describe those in the following sections.
 
You can use a backdoor way to check out the social responsibility of a com-
pany that you’re interested in, and that’s to see if it’s owned by a mutual fund 
that matches your investing style or if it’s included in an index that looks at 
the performance of companies that meet certain social criteria. If it makes the 
cut of people who are paid good money to check out the social standards, it 
may be a firm you want to do business with.
Property and casualty insurance (auto and home)
The social issues for these companies relate to how they treat claimants 
(see the earlier section “Satisfactory customer service”). Some may invest 
more responsibly than others, but it will be close to impossible to get that 
information.
Health insurance
The United States is one of the few nations on earth that doesn’t provide 
government-sponsored health insurance. Or rather, it doesn’t provide health 
insurance to people under the age of 65. Whether the government should 
provide health insurance is a different debate for a different book, but if 
you want or need health insurance, you may be wondering if you can buy a 
socially responsible policy.
The short answer is no: Many healthcare benefits are mandated by state law. 
For example, you may not want to deal with a health insurer that covers con-
traceptives. You can probably get a policy for yourself that doesn’t (many 
Roman Catholic dioceses have health plans that don’t cover contraceptives 
for their employees and family members), but you won’t find an insurance 
company that won’t cover them for anyone everywhere.
Likewise, you may not believe that blood transfusions, in vitro fertilization, or 
psychiatric medications are moral, but you won’t find an insurance company 
that tailors all of its plans to your desires.

250
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
 
Health insurance companies can be responsible in other ways, mainly by how 
they treat healthcare providers and patients after they file claims.
For example, some insurance companies have had policies of dropping 
people who file claims in the first few months of coverage. That’s why you 
should do a little due diligence and Internet searching before signing for a 
new policy.
Life insurance
Life insurance is coverage in case you die. Naturally, we’re all going to die 
someday, but the real question (for insurance purposes) is when. Dying 
young is unlikely, but someone who does may leave behind a partner or chil-
dren who need to be provided for. It’s more likely that you’ll die when you’re 
old and have no one who depends on you for income, although plenty of 
older people have ongoing financial obligations to others.
Many life insurance plans have savings and tax-deferral features that may be 
attractive to some investors, especially those with a lot of assets.
Life insurance comes in two main types:
 
✓ Term life provides coverage against death for a specific time period, 
and then it expires if the insured person doesn’t die or renew the policy. 
It doesn’t include any savings component.
 
✓ Whole life provides a payoff when you die, but it also includes a sav-
ings component. Part of your premium is invested and accumulates at a 
guaranteed rate of return. You can then borrow against that amount; if 
you don’t repay it by the time you die, the payout to your beneficiaries 
is reduced.
In general, you have no say in how your premium payment is invested. Some 
insurance companies affiliated with religious organizations follow social 
investing principles, but not all do. Baptist Life (www.baptistlife.org) 
won’t invest in companies that support abortion, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, 
or pornography. Thrivent (www.thrivent.com), which sells to Lutherans, 
has no social screen on its investments.
Borrowing: Can It Be Done Responsibly?
This is a book about investing, but as long as we’re talking about banking 
here, why not talk about borrowing, too? For many people, borrowing is 
a way to finance an investment, especially for residential real estate or 

251
 Chapter 14: Banking on Social Responsibility (and Insuring It, Too)
education. If you’re trying to be socially responsible in your choices of invest-
ment, you may be tempted to find ways to borrow along the same lines. 
Unfortunately, it’s really hard to do that because it’s hard to know exactly 
where your lenders receive their funds.
If your concern is that the source of the funds being loaned to you is some 
repressive dictator in a far-off land who cuts down trees and condones sweat-
shop labor, well, there’s not much you can do. Those people are allowed 
to make bank deposits, and the bank won’t tell you who its depositors are 
unless you happen to be bearing a subpoena.
If your concern is that the profits from your loan support the causes you 
care about, then you may prefer to work with the lending officers at a CDFI or 
community development credit union, which I cover earlier in this chapter. 
These organizations generally lend only to members or to people in their 
neighborhoods, however.
 
Several mortgage and loan companies tout themselves as socially responsible. 
In reality, these firms agree to donate a percentage of their profits or fees to 
nonprofit organizations. You may prefer to deal with a company like this, but 
there’s nothing special about the loans or the sources of funds for them.
With all that being said about the limits of socially responsible lending, a 
different type of borrowing captures the interest of social investors, no pun 
intended. That type involves margin loans, which appeal to the investor side. 
Many social investors, like other investors, want to take on additional risk, 
and one way to do that is to trade on margin. This involves using borrowed 
money to buy more shares, more contracts, or more bonds.
Margin is the money in your account that you borrow against, and almost all 
brokers will be happy to arrange a margin loan for you. It’s great for them 
because it means that you’ll use the money to make more trades and gener-
ate more commissions for the brokerage firm. If you ever hear traders talk 
about “other people’s money,” well, that’s using margin.
With a margin loan, your own account is collateral. The funds themselves 
come from the broker’s deposits and credit sources, so you don’t know who 
is lending you the money.
If the security goes up in price, you’ll make an even greater profit than you 
would have otherwise, but it if goes down, you’ll lose even more because 
you’ll have to pay back the loan — with interest — no matter what happens.

252
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Taking the credit: Charitable affinity credit cards
A popular socially responsible personal financial 
tool is the affinity credit card. These are issued 
by banks under license to a charity, college, or 
other group. The group receives a licensing fee 
and a cut of the money charged to the cards.
The banks offer these cards because they get 
a warm, fuzzy feeling from helping out the com-
munity, right? No. The banks promote affinity 
cards because the folks who hold these cards 
are less likely to change their credit cards and 
are less likely to complain about fees because 
the cardholders get a warm, fuzzy feeling from 
using them. Typically, the investors who like 
these do so because they don’t realize how 
small the donation is.
Warmth and fuzziness are pretty much the only 
attractions to affinity cards, because they aren’t 
fundraising machines. The donation ranges by 
card but is often between 0.5 and 1 percent of 
the amount charged. That works out to between 
$0.50 and $1.00 for every $100 you spend — not 
exactly big bucks for your favorite cause. These 
cards often come with higher fees and annual 
percentage rates of interest than ordinary credit 
cards, too. And who gets the tax deduction for 
that little charitable contribution? The big issu-
ing bank, not you.
You and your cause may be better off if you 
keep your current credit card, which I hope 
has no annual fee and that you pay off in full 
each month. Then send the organization a tax-
deductible contribution for the amount of the 
annual fee on its credit card offering.
Because the contribution to the cause is small, 
don’t charge up charitable credit cards with 
more than you can pay off in full and on time. 
Interest and late fees go to the credit card com-
pany, not the charity.
If you want to get an affinity card anyway, some 
of the many issuers include:
 ✓ Bank of America (www.bankofamerica.
com/creditcards)
 ✓ Chase (www.chase.com/PFSCredit
CardHome.html)
 ✓ Working Assets (www.workingassets.
com)
You can also check with your favorite charity 
or your alma mater, because it may offer a card 
through another bank.

The Responsible Side 
of Real Estate
In This Chapter
▶ Brushing up on real estate 101
▶ Investing where people live
▶ Counting on commercial real estate
▶ Understanding real estate securities
E
veryone needs a place to live, and most people need a place to work, 
too. As long as we have to choose one place in which to live our lives, 
these buildings and the land that they sit on are going to have value. Value 
attracts investors. And sometimes, real estate attracts questionable inves-
tors, like the stereotypical slumlord wanna-be billionaire with a bad toupee 
and worse taste in architecture.
Still, you can invest in real estate within a socially responsible context. This 
type of investing can rebuild communities, improve the environment, and 
provide housing to people who need it — even people with low incomes — 
and all without becoming a slumlord.
This chapter is primarily about investment opportunities rather than the 
purchase of a primary residence. It covers issues surrounding residential 
development and commercial development, as well as real estate investment 
trusts, bonds, and other securities that people can use to pick up real estate 
exposure. However, if your own house is or will be your largest investment, 
you may get a few ideas from this chapter on how to think about social 
responsibilities as well as the number of bathrooms and age of the furnace.

254
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Regarding the Real Estate Realities
You may think you know a lot about real estate because if you’re like most 
American adults, you own the place where you live. Buying residential real 
estate to live in isn’t the same as buying real estate for an investment return. 
(No matter what your real estate agent may have told you, residential real 
estate isn’t always a great investment, but if you own your own house, you 
can paint the walls any color you want. What’s that worth to you?)
A real estate return comes in two forms, land and buildings. Beyond the two 
basic forms of real estate return are four categories of real estate for investors:
 
✓ Raw land: The land itself, aside from any development or structures
 
✓ Core real estate: Low-risk property that needs very little or no develop-
ment, changes, or buildings
 
✓ Value-added real estate: Higher risk property that requires major 
changes or development
 
✓ New development: Highest risk property that requires a complete devel-
opment overhaul
You need to know some basics about these categories before diving into the 
market. In the following sections, I tell you what to look for and how these dif-
ferent types of real estate can affect your investment decisions.
Like you didn’t know this: Location, 
location, location!
It’s the oldest cliché in real estate: The three most important factors are loca-
tion, location, location. Like most clichés, everyone says it because it’s true. 
The demand for people to be in a particular geographic location combined 
with the supply of places in that location is the primary driver of prices and 
investment returns. There’s a reason that houses cost more in San Francisco, 
for example, than in Canton, Ohio.
Real estate projects, funded by investors, can change the dynamics of a loca-
tion. That change may be for the better, or it may be for worse. Most social 
investors want to consider how a project works with the land and its current 
neighbors when they’re making decisions about where to put their money. 
Whether a project is good or bad can depend entirely on where it’s located.
Commercial shopping strips can add life to neighborhoods where people lack 
a good grocery store or a coffee shop at which to congregate, or developers 

255
 Chapter 15: The Responsible Side of Real Estate
can pave over open space and require people to drive for miles to shop at 
the same stores they can find anywhere. For the responsible investor, there’s 
no one answer; it’s about the fit between the project and the place.
The neighbors, by the way, aren’t limited to the people who live and work 
near the project. They can include the plants and animals in the area, the 
people who drink water that may pass through the site, and the people who 
breathe the air that goes over it. Hence, an industrial project will have a 
much wider effect than a residential one, but that doesn’t mean that an indus-
trial project is inherently bad and a residential one good.
Landing on land deals
In general, land is a store of value, which is a type of asset that tends to 
vary in price only with inflation. (Precious metals are also stores of value.) 
But in some cases, the value of land can change, sometimes dramatically, 
up or down. If the parcel happens to be located somewhere that becomes 
more desirable to live or work, the demand for the property will go up, no 
matter what kind of structure is on it. Buildings can be torn down, but the 
land stays. Likewise, if the land becomes uninhabitable due to pollution or 
a lack of water, or if people can’t make a living in the place where the land 
happens to be, then it will fall in value.
One of the basic categories of real estate investment involves raw land. Raw 
land is the dirt and rock that sits underneath the buildings. It may be pro-
ductive if it’s suitable for agriculture, timber, or mining, or it may simply be 
the underpinning for someone’s house, office, church, or store. You should 
always investigate the different possible uses before deciding to invest in land.
In most cases, land doesn’t generate revenue. Most investment returns will 
come from the change in value between when the land is bought and when 
it’s sold.
 
Mineral rights are sometimes sold separately from the land. If you’re consid-
ering purchasing land to open a (environmentally sensitive, worker-friendly) 
mine, make sure you’re getting what you want!
 
Although Americans are used to owning land, that’s not possible everywhere 
in the world. In some countries, people view land as something that can’t be 
owned, like the air around us. In other places, much or all of the land is under 
the control of ancient landholding families; people who buy buildings enter 
into a long-term lease (say, for 99 years) for the land underneath them. And 
in some countries, only citizens can own land; investors from other countries 
cannot. If you’re thinking of buying real estate overseas, whether for personal 
use or investment purposes, make sure you know the local laws before signing 
any contracts.

Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Determining the potential of developments,
buildings, and structures
The building that sits on the land is almost always a depreciating asset; it 
will go down in value unless it receives constant maintenance. Water heaters 
need to be replaced, carpet wears out, and someone knocks a chair into a 
wall and cracks the plaster. Even with ongoing maintenance, a building can 
be damaged beyond repair by flood or fire, or become hopelessly out of style.
But unlike land, buildings can generate an ongoing stream of income in the 
form of rent. What you lose on depreciation, you may be able to pick up in the 
form of a regular payment. You need to take into consideration three invest-
ment categories when evaluating structural real estate for investment potential:
 
✓ Core real estate: This is how real estate investors describe holdings that 
are geographically diverse, have low risk, and require little rehab work. 
It may include residential buildings; institutional facilities, such as hos-
pitals; shopping centers; and offices. Investors expect to receive most of 
their returns from rental income with less profit from price appreciation.
 
✓ Value-added real estate: This category includes investment properties 
that have higher risk. Usually, the properties in this group require big 
changes before they can be considered to be core. The building may 
need to be rebuilt or undergo a major overhaul. These properties may 
be located in places prone to natural disasters or in a neighborhood 
that’s undergoing big changes. Investors generally expect to get capital 
gains from value-added real estate with some return from rents as well.
 
✓ New development: In a new development, the investors buy raw land or 
raze a defunct building, and then put something completely new in its 
place. It’s high risk: A lot can go wrong during the construction process, 
and when it’s done, maybe no one will want to live in the new housing 
development or move their operations to the new office. But high risk 
carries the potential for high returns. Investors expect to earn almost all 
of their return from price appreciation.
Who does the construction work?
When a real estate investment project involves construction, one concern 
socially responsible investors may have is who will do the work. Construction 
jobs tend to be physically demanding, but they also pay well — especially if a 
responsible contractor is in charge of the project.
In many places around the country, a commercial construction project will 
be done with union labor or with nonunion labor that’s paid close to union 
wage rates. Construction work can be dangerous, so a responsible site will 
follow safe practices and mandate the use of safety equipment by the work-
ers. Hardhats, gloves, work boots, and safety goggles should be the norm, no 
matter what the local laws require.

257
 Chapter 15: The Responsible Side of Real Estate
 
In the United States, the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 requires that any contrac-
tors and subcontractors working on federal contracts worth more than $2,000 
pay their workers at least the prevailing wage rate for the area, which is usu-
ally keyed off of union wage rates. Because many commercial and multifamily 
residential projects include some federal funding or tax benefits, many con-
struction workers receive union wages regardless of whether they are union 
members.
 
Construction jobs pay so well because they are highly seasonal; in many places 
in the country, a construction worker will only have work for part of the year. If 
no new projects are underway, the worker won’t have any work at all.
What materials go into the project?
A building is an enclosure of space. Hence, the responsible investor cares 
not only about where that space is, but also about what materials are used to 
contain it.
Most communities have zoning rules and building codes that govern the 
type and style of materials used. (Do I even have to say that a responsible 
real estate investment should follow local requirements or receive variances 
through proper channels? And that a bag of cash handed off to the alder-
man’s campaign manager is probably not a proper channel?) In many cases, 
meeting the code isn’t enough to satisfy a social investor. An investor who 
cares about the environment wants to ensure that the project uses more-
efficient materials than are probably specified. An investor who cares about 
community development wants to see the use of local suppliers and local 
labor on a project that makes a neighborhood better.
The choices influence how the building will be used, too. Reusing materi-
als may seem to be a more environmental choice, but not if they lead to 
inefficient operations and greater energy consumption for the building’s 
occupants than using new materials. A floor plan that allows space to be 
reconfigured as a tenant’s needs change may allow for a building to have a 
longer life than one that has less flexibility.
 
About a quarter of all the material dumped into U.S. landfills is construction 
debris: stuff thrown out when a building is razed and left over when construc-
tion is completed. Reducing the amount of debris by using buildings longer 
and constructing them efficiently creates big savings in landfill space.
Raising Responsible Profits 
in Residential Projects
Because everyone needs a place to live, housing is in constant demand. If 
the population is growing, the number of housing units needed grows, too. 

258
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Hence, residential real estate is a popular market for investors, and not just 
those who are looking to buy their own house to live in.
Residential real estate falls into three main categories:
 
✓ Single family: Single-family houses represent what most people think of 
when they think of housing. Although generally targeted at middle- and 
upper-income buyers, some single-family projects are aimed at lower-
income and rental residents as well.
 
✓ Multifamily: Multifamily housing can fall into several subcategories, 
including rental housing, condominiums, and senior housing. The scale 
can vary significantly; a two-flat is multifamily housing, as is a high-rise 
condominium building with hundreds of units.
 
✓ Second/vacation houses: Second houses are built in resort areas. 
Almost by definition, the people who buy them are rich; they may be 
looking for a place to go on vacation, to rent on the side for some extra 
income, or to turn into a primary residence upon retirement.
Within these basic categories are several favorable opportunities for the 
socially responsible investor interested in real estate. I cover those opportuni-
ties in the following sections, starting with “Supporting Section 8 properties.”
Supporting Section 8 properties
Section 8 is a voucher program operated by the federal government that helps 
low-income people pay for rental housing. Some Section 8 buildings are for 
senior citizens, and others are for families. Most Section 8 vouchers cover the 
difference between 30 percent of the family’s income and 80 to 100 percent of 
the fair-market monthly rent. Not all buildings accept Section 8 vouchers, so 
there’s a steady demand for developers and landlords to create more units 
that accept them.
Many Section 8 apartments are in mixed-income buildings, which have some 
subsidized tenants and some tenants who pay full rate. Some landlords agree 
to accept Section 8 tenants only when they have vacancies. Because the 
demand for these units is so great and the rent is paid on time, those land-
lords who do participate usually find that it creates steady business.
If you’re looking for a socially responsible investment in real estate, Section 
8 properties may be one way to go. You can buy them outright or participate 
through real estate investment trusts or partnerships, described later in the 
chapter. The rental income is usually good, and the property will provide a 
lot of families with an affordable place to live.

259
 Chapter 15: The Responsible Side of Real Estate
Participating in the public 
housing conversion
In many cities, the government built apartments for the poorest people. These 
projects were often high-rise buildings set away from the rest of the commu-
nity. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it turned out not to be. The iso-
lation made it hard for the tenants to stay engaged in their communities, and 
thugs often took over the elevators, making residents’ lives miserable.
Hence, many cities are rethinking their public housing projects. In many cases, 
they’re being torn down. The land is often sold to a developer at a reduced rate 
in exchange for a commitment to build new housing that would accommodate 
low-income and higher-income families, the better to create a community.
This conversion of public housing often creates investment opportunities 
because it requires a mix of public and private funding to be successful. 
Done right, it creates a path for you as a social investor to improve a com-
munity. Done incorrectly, it removes places for poor people to live and forces 
them to leave the community. Many banks and real estate partnerships are 
involved in these projects and are looking for investors.
Generating responsible gentrification
Many cities have older neighborhoods that fell out of fashion years ago. At 
some point, though, a bright person looked around and saw interesting and 
well-constructed buildings, maybe close to downtown or public transit, with 
a lot of possibilities for a makeover that would attract wealthier residents.
This process of turning a poor neighborhood into one that draws folks 
with money is known as gentrification. Done well, it adds life to a neighbor-
hood, creates jobs, and strengthens commerce. Done poorly, rafts of ugly 
McMansions attract people who don’t want to mix with the current residents, 
draw generic chain stores that raise rents and force out local businesses, and 
cause property taxes to go up so much that longtime homeowners are forced 
to sell and move.
Gentrification can be done right, and as a social investor, that’s what you 
want to see:
 
✓ First, the new developments and rehabilitation of existing buildings 
should be done with different types of people in mind. Units should be tar-
geted to a mix of income levels with different-sized residences to appeal 
to different types of families. A longtime senior citizen in the neighbor-
hood should not feel left out because only young families are moving in.

260
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
 
✓ A second key to good gentrification is gradual change. Every community 
changes over time as people’s preferences in housing change and as the 
local economy evolves. Gentrification may speed that up a bit, but there 
will be fewer clashes between the current neighbors and the new ones if 
the changes happen slowly. That way, for example, existing businesses 
can make changes to cater to the new clientele rather than feel forced out.
 
✓ Finally, good gentrification shows respect for the existing flair of the 
neighborhood. If the block consists of old, small wood-frame houses, it’s 
more respectful to build a new, medium-sized wood-frame house than an 
enormous brick mansion that stretches from lot line to lot line.
Supplying suitable workforce housing
In many expensive communities, the people who work there can’t afford to 
live there. Some places are so expensive that teachers, firefighters, nurses, 
and even government officials can’t find housing that suits their budget. If 
these people have to live too far out, they’ll simply find jobs elsewhere.
That’s why many places are looking to add housing that allows people who 
are already part of the community to afford to live there. This is called work-
force housing, sometimes known as affordable housing, and it often creates 
new opportunities for responsible real estate investors. You can find out 
more about this in Chapter 6.
Cashing In on Commercial Projects
Commercial real estate includes office buildings, retail shops, and light indus-
trial facilities (think screening designs on T-shirts, not steel mills). As a social 
investor, you may want to encourage certain types of development over 
others, or you may care about the environmental impact of different projects.
In some ways, commercial real estate is simple: You identify the need, build 
or remodel the building, find the tenants, and collect the rent. They write the 
checks, and you cash them. Hurray! But given that the building has to be con-
structed, costs money to operate, and may be more attractive to some types 
of tenants than others, there are some concerns that social investors may 
want to consider.
This section covers some of those key issues. These include environmen-
tal impact, space for nonprofit organizations, and access to public transit. 
Because commercial real estate is tied closely to community economic devel-
opment, you should read this section along with Chapter 6.

 Chapter 15: The Responsible Side of Real Estate
Backing brownfield restoration
Brownfields are a hot area for socially responsible commercial develop-
ment. These are old industrial sites that are no longer in use. Maybe the 
site once had a factory or a gas station or a meatpacking facility sitting on 
it. Redeveloping these sites is a good idea from both an economic and an 
environmental perspective. It cleans up the contamination and creates new 
opportunities in an existing community. But as good as brownfield restora-
tion and development can be, it’s not easy. However, government incentives 
and good profits await the investor who does it right.
The good news? Brownfields tend to be located in urban areas where the 
infrastructures of transportation, utilities, and workers are already in place. 
Further, redeveloping existing sites takes development pressure off undevel-
oped sites (known as greenfields) and reduces urban sprawl. But wait, there’s 
a catch. Many of these older sites have possible environmental contamina-
tion that can complicate matters. Developing a brownfield site may involve 
environmental investigation, cleanup, and closure costs, not to mention an 
ongoing liability. There is risk, but risk leads to return.
Evaluating restoration risks
How real are these risks? It depends. (You knew I was going to say that, 
right?) Many sites have contamination problems that are easy to identify and 
straightforward to address, such as lead paint, asbestos-covered pipes, and 
underground storage tanks that aren’t leaking. These types of cleanups are 
relatively cheap and easy, so some developers have made a tidy profit by 
finding properties that cost less to clean up than the purchase discount given 
for the potential problems.
Besides the opportunity to make money by doing an effective cleanup, the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) offers brownfield developers 
money to encourage them to do the work. This can be as much as to $200,000 
to assess the property’s damage, with another $200,000 to go toward the 
cleanup of petroleum spills. Many state and local governments offer addi-
tional grants and subsidies to developers because they want these vacant 
lots turned into viable, tax-producing projects.
Insuring against ongoing issues
After the property is cleaned up, there are still some ongoing liabilities. New 
contamination may be found, or new regulations may have to be met. Maybe 
15 years from now, for example, scientists discover a new cancer-causing 
compound, and it’s found on the site, but today no one knows that the sub-
stance is a problem.

262
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
That’s why investors in brownfields need to look for insurance. After all, 
insurance companies are in the business of transferring risk, and coverage 
for potential environmental liabilities is one that many insurers are happy 
to take on. This protects investors in two ways: First, it limits the ongoing 
expenses that may be associated with operating a brownfield project, and 
it provides some assurance that the project cleanup was done correctly. 
Insurance companies take on risks, not certainties!
Although the potential liabilities for contamination aren’t known, costs of 
insurance are spelled out upfront and allow brownfield developers to shield 
themselves from costs.
 
Because of the potential for problems with unknown contaminants, brown-
fields are rarely appropriate for residential use, especially if the homes will 
have yards where children may play.
 
If you’re investing in a brownfield, before plunking down your money, check 
to see
 
✓ How much research went into potential problems
 
✓ How well the cleanup costs are quantified
 
✓ How many unknown liabilities are covered by insurance
Setting aside nonprofit office space
One challenge many nonprofit organizations face is finding space for their 
operations. Community organizations, arts groups, and charitable service 
providers often have no place to operate. Because many social investors do 
care about nonprofits, there’s an opportunity.
In some big community redevelopment projects, real estate investors who 
agree to create space for nonprofit organizations may benefit from subsi-
dies or tax benefits. That’s one way to do well by doing good. If the landlord 
allows a nonprofit to use space for no rent or for reduced rent, tax benefits 
may accrue from the in-kind donation.
Encouraging public transportation
Cars are expensive. They use up a dwindling natural resource, they emit pollu-
tion, and they kill lots of people every year. Hence, responsible development 
often includes elements designed to reduce the need for people to use cars to 
get between where they live and where they work, shop, and have appointments.

263
 Chapter 15: The Responsible Side of Real Estate
The easy way to do this is to locate a new project near existing public transit 
routes. The problems are that suitable space may not be available and many 
communities don’t have much public transit anyway. Another option, extend-
ing existing public transit routes, is effective but can be extremely expensive.
Another alternative is for the developer to provide its own transit. For exam-
ple, an office building may run a shuttle between the site and an existing train 
stop a few miles away. A suburban development featuring a mall, an apart-
ment complex, and an office park separated by major highways can operate 
its own bus service so people don’t need to get in their cars to go shopping 
on their lunch hour.
Saving in Real Estate Securities
Yes, real estate securities (such as mortgage-backed bonds) have a bad name 
because of some of the problems that took place with loans in 2007 and 2008, 
especially those based on speculative housing projects and made to borrow-
ers with poor credit. But many real estate securities are fine investments, and 
some even meet different responsible investing criteria. Want to know more? 
Read on!
Making sense of mortgage-backed 
securities
A mortgage-backed security is similar to a bond in that it pays regular interest, 
but it’s not exactly the same. Instead, the organizer pools together mortgage 
loans from thousands of people into one contract. People who buy shares 
of the pool (known as certificates) then receive a proportionate share of the 
principal and interest repaid every month.
The catch is that the cash flow isn’t predictable; if someone moves or refi-
nances his loan, the certificate holder receives the entire principal but loses 
out on the future interest payments. Thus, mortgage-backed securities have 
tremendous interest rate risk, even if they have little repayment risk. This 
could hurt someone who depends on the regular interest to cover expenses. 
The principal is returned, but that income goes away.
Why sell the mortgages in the first place? Well, it lets the bank remove the 
long-term exposure from its balance sheet while bringing in money that it can 
lend to new borrowers, thus keeping more liquidity in the mortgage market.

264
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Mortgage-backed securities are of two main types:
 
✓ Agency-backed securities: Agency-backed securities are issued on mort-
gages that meet the credit standards set by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, 
and Freddie Mac. (All of those firms once had stately names such as 
Government National Mortgage Association, but the acronyms quickly 
were smooshed into completely unrelated names such as Ginnie Mae.) 
These organizations guarantee that investors will receive the principal 
and interest due to them if the underlying borrowers default on their 
mortgages. All three receive funding from the federal government.
 
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were spun out from the federal government 
in 1968. They performed well for 40 years, providing capital to banks 
and creating good markets for mortgage-backed securities. But in the 
last few years, it seems that banks became sloppy about risk, and both 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became overextended. In September 2008, 
the government resumed control, guaranteeing their securities and 
propping up the mortgage market.
 
✓ Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs): A collateralized mortgage 
obligation includes mortgages that don’t meet the standards of the three 
agencies. This may be because they are big, cover 100 percent or more 
of the property value, or were made to borrowers with less-than-perfect 
credit. CMOs may also be issued on commercial or multifamily proper-
ties. A CMO carries some risk because it doesn’t come with a guarantee 
of principal repayment. In exchange, the pool generally pays a higher 
rate of interest.
Because mortgage-backed securities are used to finance real estate, they are 
an option for investors looking to pick up exposure to the dynamics of the 
market. If your style of social investing includes support for homeownership, 
they may be of interest to you.
Relying on REITs
REIT (pronounced reet) is the acronym for Real Estate Investment Trust. It’s 
almost like a mutual fund for real estate. Most REITs are publicly traded com-
panies that invest in a group of real estate properties. Some specialize in just 
one type of property, such as hotels, while others invest in a diverse array of 
projects. Some REITs don’t even invest in the properties themselves. Known 
as mortgage REITs, they buy mortgage-backed securities (see the preceding 
section for more on these).

265
 Chapter 15: The Responsible Side of Real Estate
Very few REITs follow an explicit social agenda when they select their hold-
ings, but that doesn’t mean you can’t find some that fit your preferences. You 
can find out about the investment style and holdings by reading the REIT’s 
annual report and then deciding if it works for you financially and ethically.
Selecting special assessment 
municipal bonds
A municipal bond is a bond issued by a state or local government. They can 
be issued for any purpose, but one category, the special assessment munici-
pal bond, is often issued to finance commercial and residential construction 
projects. It works like this: The local government wants to attract new devel-
opment to improve the community’s economy. The government arranges 
to issue municipal bonds to offer developers low-cost capital or to build the 
infrastructure that the project needs.
For example, a city may build new roads, extend sewer lines, and expand a 
school to support a new residential development. It issues bonds to cover the 
cost, and then repays the bonds from property taxes paid by the residents in 
the new subdivision. You can find out more about bonds in Chapter 12.
These bonds might appeal to you if you’re looking for socially responsible 
real estate exposure. They support community development, which is of 
interest to a lot of people.
Banking on the banks
Real estate investing is closely tied to banking. Land and buildings are 
expensive, so most purchasers need some help. Many real estate developers 
borrow money during the life of the projects. The need for funds not only cre-
ates opportunities for people who want to invest in real estate directly, but it 
also creates appreciation potential for those lenders.
One way to add real estate exposure to your investment portfolio is to buy 
shares in commercial banks that specialize in lending to responsible develop-
ers. In most cases, these will be community development financial institutions 
(CDFIs), which I describe in detail in Chapter 14. Some of these banks are 
publicly traded, so you can buy shares in them through your stock broker. 
For those banks that don’t have public shares, you can profit from the 
growth of their responsible community development by opening a savings 
account or CD with them.

266
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Choosing limited partnerships
Many real estate projects are structured as limited partnerships. The devel-
oper, who is the general partner, makes the decisions; the general partner 
brings in a group of investors who put up the money for the project and 
share in the rewards. On a larger development, one or more of the limited 
partners may be a REIT (see the “Relying on REITs” section earlier in the 
chapter).
Although limited partnerships are popular forms of real estate investments, 
they’re not publicly traded and are usually only available to high-net-worth 
individuals. You can read more about limited partnerships in Chapter 16.
Calculating the taxable equivalent yield
The big advantage of most municipal bonds is 
that they’re exempt from federal taxes and may 
be exempt from state taxes, too, depending on 
where you live. That makes it easy for state and 
local governments to raise money because 
investors will accept a lower interest rate if 
they don’t have to pay taxes on the income.
Because of the lower rates, many investors 
are better off buying bonds that are not tax 
deductible.
To figure out whether a municipal bond is 
right for you, you need to calculate the taxable 
equivalent yield so you can compare returns on 
municipal bonds to returns on others.
Your taxable equivalent yield is found by using 
the equation
 
 R(tf)/(1 – t)
where R(tf) is the interest rate on the tax-free 
investment and (1 – t) is 1 less your top tax rate.
For example, if you’re considering a tax-free 
bond that pays 3 percent interest and you are 
in the 28 percent tax bracket, then your taxable 
equivalent yield is 3/(1-0.28) or 4.17 percent. If 
you can find a taxable bond offering an interest 
rate of 4.17 percent or more, you’re better off 
buying it and paying the taxes. Otherwise, you’ll 
make more money with the tax-free security.
Because different people are in different tax 
brackets, what makes sense for you may not 
for someone else. Do the math first!
By the way, retirement accounts such as IRAs 
and 401(k)s already have plenty of tax advan-
tages, so municipal bonds aren’t appropriate 
for them.

I
n the New Testament, Paul wrote that the love of money is the root of 
all evil (1 Timothy 6:10). Money itself isn’t evil; just the misuse of it is. A 
rich social investor isn’t an oxymoron, and social investing isn’t just for the 
thoughtful middle class. Anyone can be a social investor, whether through 
a $25 microloan or a multimillion dollar commitment to a hedge fund.
Not only can rich people invest socially, but some of the most conscientious 
shareholders can be found among the largest pensions, foundations, and 
endowments. These investors are usually interested in investment vehicles 
that aren’t appropriate for smaller investors, such as hedge funds, private 
equity funds, and venture capital funds. Collectively, these funds are called 
private partnerships.
If you are rich, hope to be rich, or are working with a rich institution, you 
may care about these investment options and how they can work in a social 
context. Because these investment pools can wield a lot of influence on the 
projects and companies they invest in, you may also want to know more 
about them so you can make better decisions about more ordinary invest-
ments, too. This chapter covers the basics of these high-end investment 
vehicles.

268
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Deciphering the Structures 
of High Finance
When you enter the world of high finance, you’ll find that the rules are different 
from other levels of investing. Hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture 
capital funds aren’t merely mutual funds on steroids; they’re completely differ-
ent ways of investing (and with a lot less regulation than a mutual fund has).
In high finance, the funds are set up as private partnerships. Investment 
opportunities aren’t widely promoted, and buyers have to meet strict require-
ments because the fund managers have to ensure that they aren’t marketing 
an unregulated investment to people who would be inappropriate for it. These 
funds also have higher fees than many other types of investments. If you’re 
considering putting money into these funds, you’ll want to know more about 
them. I go into details about the various types of funds later in the chapter. 
Here I give you the basics on how to invest in these funds.
Putting up with partnerships
The three main types of private partnerships — hedge funds, private equity 
funds, and venture capital funds — are legally structured as stand-alone busi-
nesses. The fund’s investors become partners in the business, although some 
types of partners are more equal than others. The arrangement is governed 
by a partnership agreement that lays out how the fund will be managed, what 
the fees will be, how often the investor will be called for funds, how often the 
investor can withdraw funds, and other factors.
Partnership agreements can sometimes be negotiated, giving some investors 
different rights than others. One area of interest to social investors is a side 
pocket, which is a part of the fund that is made available to some partners 
but not others. That means a fund could hold investments that would be 
objectionable to some of the partners without forcing them to own it. (Of 
course, a side pocket could also be used to give some partners better oppor-
tunities than others.)
The partnership doesn’t pay any taxes itself. Instead, each year it sends the 
partners a report on IRS Form 1065 (also called Schedule K1) that breaks 
down the partner’s share of the fund’s income and expenses. The partner 
then pays taxes, or not, depending on his own situation.

269
 Chapter 16: Getting into High Finance: Private Partnerships
General partners
The general partners are the people who organize the fund. They are the 
founders and key employees of the fund management company who put 
some of their own money into the investment. They are responsible for 
making the day-to-day investment decisions that govern the fund, and they 
have liability for their decisions. The general partners have to report their 
performance to the limited partners, but they don’t have to take any input 
from the limiteds on the investment strategy. They receive a fee for their ser-
vices and, in many cases, a performance bonus for beating certain targets.
Limited partners
The limited partners put up most of the money for the fund. They turn their 
investment over to the general partners, paying them a fee out of those funds 
for the management expertise and related expenses. The limited partners 
have little liability beyond the amount of money invested. If the investments 
don’t work out and the fund declares bankruptcy, creditors can’t go after the 
limited partners (but they may be able to go after the general partners).
Limited partners have little say in how the fund operates. They may receive 
regular reports on performance, but not much else.
Who can buy?
These funds are not for everyone. They are designed for really wealthy 
people and institutional investors who can afford to invest a few million 
dollars and still have plenty of money left over for near-term needs. If you 
happen to be in one of these categories, you can certainly invest in a hedge 
fund or other private partnership responsibly. Prince Charles, the heir to the 
British throne, fits the definition. He established a fund in 2008 to invest in 
sustainable real estate development projects in English cities. His charities 
will hold a third of the $2 billion fund, known as Tellesma, and other inves-
tors will contribute the rest.
Even if you’re not royalty, you may want to know more about who invests 
and how. Limited investment partnerships aren’t required to register with 
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), so they can buy and sell 
securities and businesses without reporting most of their activities. They 
receive that exemption as long as they deal with investors who are consid-
ered to be sophisticated, and no one else.

270
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Sophistication, under SEC regulations, is a function of how much money a 
person has. Pick up any gossip magazine and look at the pictures of pop stars 
running around without underwear, and it’s pretty clear that money has no 
relationship to sophistication. (Come to think of it, Britney Spears lost money 
in a hedge fund investment that turned out to be fraudulent many years ago.) 
But go tell that to the SEC. Under its regulations, unregistered investments 
such as hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital can be sold to inves-
tors who meet the financial requirements of either accreditation or qualifica-
tion (I explain these terms in the upcoming sections).
 
Although the SEC doesn’t regulate limited investment partnerships such 
as hedge funds or venture capital funds, that doesn’t mean these funds are 
operating in a state of anarchy. They’re subject to contract laws regulating 
partnerships and fraud, tax laws, securities exchange regulations, and other 
regulations.
Accredited investors
To the SEC, an accredited investor is one who meets any of the following 
standards:
 
✓ Has a net worth of more than $1 million, owned alone or jointly with a 
spouse
 
✓ Has earned $200,000 in each of the past two years, if single
 
✓ Has earned $300,000 in each of the past two years when combined with 
a spouse, if married
 
✓ Has a reasonable expectation of making the same amount in the future
The thought is that a person who meets these standards can afford to lose 
money on a bad investment and probably knows more about investments 
than someone with less money to invest. Sure, that’s debatable, but it’s also 
the law.
 
Although a limited partnership has the right, and possibly the obligation, to 
ask investors for proof of their accredited status, many funds simply set their 
minimum investment high enough that just about anyone who invests in them 
would have to meet the standards. If the minimum investment is $10 million, 
it’s safe to assume that any participating investors meet the requirements.
Qualified purchasers
The qualified purchaser standard is higher than the accredited investor stan-
dard, and it applies mostly to pensions, endowments, trust funds, and other 
institutional investors. It’s simple: Those types of investors must have at 
least $5 million in assets in order to participate in unregistered investment 
partnerships.

271
 Chapter 16: Getting into High Finance: Private Partnerships
 
Some funds of funds (see the section “The combo platter: Funds of funds” for 
details on this type of investment) allow unaccredited or unqualified investors 
to purchase hedge funds, private equity funds, or venture capital funds.
Carrying the carry and other charges
Private investment partnerships aren’t cheap. In theory, they offer wealthy 
investors access to better-than-average money managers, and these manag-
ers expect to be paid for their performance. Private partnerships are also 
expensive to operate. The managers have to do extensive research on the 
companies they invest in.
A private equity investment, for example, involves a thorough investigation 
of the company; accountants and lawyers assist in assigning a valuation; 
and a proxy voting service helps track down the shareholders who need to 
approve the transaction. Many of these expenses are incurred regardless of 
whether the deal goes through.
The fund’s profit is often known as the carry, and it can be divided among the 
partners in different ways. It’s only one of the fees involved in these funds; 
the other major fee is the management fee.
Management fees
The management fee is charged by the fund’s general partners to compensate 
them for running the fund. The fee is usually somewhere between 1 and 3 
percent of the fund’s assets, but some funds may have higher or lower fees 
for star managers or complex investment strategies. Most of the money goes 
to the fund’s operations, such as hiring staff members, renting office space, 
and paying for research services.
Some of the fund’s operating expenses may be included in the management 
fee, but other expenses may be charged separately. For example, legal and 
auditing fees are usually handled apart from the management fee. The part-
nership documents should spell out what fees are paid by which group of 
partners.
Performance bonuses
Hedge fund commentators often talk about the 2 and 20, which is shorthand for 
the typical fee arrangement on many of those funds: a management fee of 2 per-
cent (sometimes more, sometimes less) along with a cut of performance — the 
carry — of 20 percent (sometimes more, sometimes less). That performance 
bonus is the share of the profits that accrue to the general partners, even if the 
general partners own a much smaller share of the total fund.

272
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
The idea behind the performance bonus is to get the managers working for 
the investors because they only make money if their investment choices 
work out. In Wall Street slang, the managers have to eat their own cooking. 
But there’s a drawback: If the fund has a down year and the manager loses 
the bonus, he may shut down the fund and start a new one, rather than lose 
out on the cash. It doesn’t happen often, but it does happen.
 
After all the fees are paid, many private partnership investors find that they’re 
no better off than if they had been in a more ordinary investment, such as a 
mutual fund.
Exploring the Types of 
High-Finance Funds
As I explain earlier in this chapter, the world of high finance is defined by pri-
vate investment partnerships that are closed to all but a handful of investors. 
Unless you have millions — note the use of the plural — these funds prob-
ably aren’t suitable for you. But if you do have really big bucks, or if you are 
monitoring the investments of a pension or foundation that does, then you’ll 
need to know more. Most partnerships fall into three categories:
 
✓ Hedge funds
 
✓ Private equity
 
✓ Venture capital
(Real estate investments are also structured as private partnerships. You can 
read more about those in Chapter 15.)
These partnerships aren’t marketed to the public; investors often have to 
know someone to get into them. These funds are also not regulated by the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; that’s one reason they’re closed to 
most investors. (I cover the specifics of the structure earlier in the chapter.)
Because they have high minimum investments (often in the millions), hedge 
funds, private equity, and venture capital funds usually take big bets. This 
doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re risky. Some of these private partner-
ships take on enormous risk, but others are specifically designed to reduce it.
 
The lines between hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital funds are 
blurry. Just like clothing, investment funds go in and out of style. For that 
matter, a hedge fund looking for investment opportunities may make a private 
equity or venture capital investment, just as a private equity fund may invest 
by using hedge fund techniques until it finds a company that it wants to con-
trol. No matter the name, as long as there are investment opportunities, there 
will be private partnerships that go after them.

273
 Chapter 16: Getting into High Finance: Private Partnerships
Hedge funds
A hedge fund is a lightly regulated investment partnership that’s designed to 
get a high return for the amount of risk taken. An absolute return fund usually 
takes very little risk and has the objective of generating a steady return year 
in and year out.
A directional fund’s objective is to get the highest possible return for the 
amount of risk taken, which means that performance can vary a great deal from 
year to year. Hedge fund managers like to talk about alpha, which is the incre-
mental return that their investment strategy adds to the investment risk taken.
 
The existence of alpha is hotly debated in the investment world. Some man-
agers do manage to add value consistently, but these folks are few and far 
between. They also charge high fees for their services, which can eat into that 
excess return.
For an in-depth look at hedge funds, I recommend picking up a copy of Hedge 
Funds For Dummies, by yours truly (Wiley). For the purposes of this chapter, 
though, here are the basics.
Tricks and techniques of the hedge fund
To earn a greater-than-expected return for the amount of risk taken, hedge 
fund managers often turn to exotic investment techniques and securities. 
Among these are
 
✓ Short selling, which involves borrowing a security, selling it, and then 
hoping that the price falls in order to buy it back and repay the loan at 
a lower price. The short seller keeps the difference between the sales 
price and the repurchase price.
 
✓ Leverage, or trading on borrowed money. This magnifies return, but it 
also magnifies risk because the loan has to be repaid no matter what 
happens to the investment.
 
✓ Options and futures contracts, which change in value based on the 
value of an underlying security. These can be used to reduce risk or add 
it, depending on the hedge fund manager’s strategy.
 
 An option gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or 
sell the underlying security at some time in the future. A futures con-
tract carries an obligation to buy or sell in the future. Both types of 
contracts are usually settled with cash payments rather than the actual 
underlying security, much to the relief of people buying and selling hog 
futures.
 
Not all hedge funds pursue unusual strategies. Some simply buy and sell 
securities the same way that a more accessible investment, such as a mutual 
fund, does.

274
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
How hedge funds are responsible
Hedge funds are characterized by their investment flexibility, so they have 
the option to be socially responsible. Many are designed to meet the restric-
tions of pension funds or endowments associated with religious organiza-
tions, such as of a Catholic hospital or a Baptist college. These funds use 
aggressive investing strategies but avoid buying stock in industries that the 
fund owners object to. Other hedge funds target Muslim investors who may 
want a steady return without exposure to bonds or other interest-bearing 
securities.
One type of hedge fund, known as a shareholder activist fund, is of special 
interest to investors who care about corporate governance (covered in 
Chapter 7). These funds identify companies that aren’t performing well rela-
tive to their industry and that have a board or management group that isn’t 
paying attention. Of special interest to these hedge funds are boards made up 
of friends of the CEO, those that receive very high rates of pay, or those that 
lack a long-term plan.
The funds buy up shares in the company, and then use their large position 
to demand such changes as new managers or the sale of part or all of the 
company. The fund manager hopes to see strong investment returns as the 
changes are made.
Private equity funds
Private equity funds take stakes in operating companies. They often do this 
in the form of a leveraged buyout (LBO), borrowing large amounts of money 
against the assets of a publicly traded company, and then using those funds 
to buy out all the current shareholders. The firm then takes a breather 
from the public markets and those pesky shareholders with performance 
expectations.
Sometimes the firm is sold or broken apart; other times it returns to the 
public markets in a newer, stronger form.
Private equity in practice
Private equity comes in a few different varieties, some of which carry differ-
ent implications than others for social investors.

275
 Chapter 16: Getting into High Finance: Private Partnerships
 
✓ Management buyouts involve the company’s senior managers and often 
other employees. The management group works with the private equity 
firm to buy a division that the parent company may have been trying to 
sell or shut down.
 
✓ Hostile takeovers are made by private equity firms that believe that a 
public company’s stock price is undervalued in part because of serious 
mistakes made by the managers, including excessive compensation and 
chummy relationships. The private equity investors take a stake in the 
company’s stock and notify the board and managers that they expect to 
use their power as shareholders to drive changes in the company. They 
then band with other shareholders or raise the money to buy them out.
 
 The hostility of a takeover is in the eye of the beholder. Because takeovers 
usually happen after a string of problems with the company, they may 
prove to be better for the employees and community in the long run by 
forcing the company to improve its operations. In other words, a hostile 
takeover can look a lot like the corporate governance investing strategy dis-
cussed in Chapter 7. Other hostile takeovers have the explicit goal of shut-
ting down the operations and selling the company’s assets, which would be 
harmful to the people who depend on the company for their livelihoods.
 
✓ Friendly takeovers are private equity transactions that take place with 
the permission of the acquired company. The company’s board may know 
that the business needs new sources of capital or that the stock price is 
so low that the company is vulnerable to a hostile takeover. The board 
would then find private equity firms that offered an appropriate amount of 
money to the existing shareholders and a suitable plan for improvement 
to benefit current employees, customers, and other stakeholders.
How private equity is responsible
Private equity funds can meet a range of different social investing standards. 
Some may avoid certain industries, others may concentrate on helping 
smaller companies grow, and still others may be able to structure acquisi-
tions without the use of interest-bearing debt. Private equity can be a valu-
able component of employee ownership, community development, and 
responsible management.
Because many corporate buyouts involve employees at all levels of the 
firm, a private equity fund may lead to a more democratic and employee-
friendly corporate culture. It may be able to create wealth throughout the 
organization, instead of concentrating it in the hands of a few executives. 
And because the private equity fund will probably want to sell the business 
at some point, it may encourage management to follow sustainable business 
practices that will create more long-term value.

276
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Venture capital funds
Venture capital is money dedicated to fund new companies. It’s often offered 
by funds that pool money from wealthy investors and then deploy it into 
start-ups that have promise and will benefit from an influx of capital.
Venture capital is risky, because so many new businesses fail and take their 
investors down with them. In 2006, 3.2 percent of all businesses in the United 
States filed for bankruptcy, according to the U.S. Small Business Association. 
The number is higher for newer companies, although precise data is hard to 
come by. And yet, a few of those small businesses succeed; some go on to 
create thousands of jobs and make enormous amounts of money. Microsoft, 
founded in a dorm room, now has a market value of $258 billion and gener-
ates almost $60 billion in annual sales.
The venture capitalist is willing to accept the trade-off of several failures in 
exchange for a few very successful companies, because the gains on the win-
ners can more than offset the losses on the losers.
How venture capital works
Some venture investments are casual: The entrepreneur raises money from 
friends and family. As the business gets bigger, though, she may need other 
investors to help the business afford more employees, more research, more 
inventory, or whatever is necessary to get that company growing.
Venture capital firms organize funds and collect commitments from investors 
to fund start-up companies. Then the firm’s staffers go out and evaluate com-
panies that may make good potential investments. They talk to the manage-
ment, research the products, and find information about the market potential.
If the firm likes what it sees, it will make an offer to take a stake in the com-
pany. It will prepare a term sheet showing how much of the company it would 
like to buy, how it would like to buy it, and any other conditions, such as 
seats on the board of directors for members of the venture capital firm or 
changes in management.
If the firm accepts the deal, the venture capital firm calls on the people who 
are investing in the fund and asks them to contribute their investment now. 
The investors write the checks, the money gets transferred to the start-up 
company, and the business gets to work on growing.
Venture capital firms don’t look to invest with the company forever. As the 
portfolio company matures, the venture capital firm will look for an exit strat-
egy, which may be an initial public offering of stock or an acquisition. That 
lets the venture investors take their profit, often to invest in other start-up 
companies.

277
 Chapter 16: Getting into High Finance: Private Partnerships
How venture capital is responsible
Venture capital is often of interest to investors who want community devel-
opment because it is intimately tied to the growth and development of new 
businesses. Some venture capital firms specialize in specific industries, such 
as healthcare or alternative fuels. And some venture capital firms avoid com-
panies in certain industries, such as gambling or alcohol, which some inves-
tors may find objectionable.
The combo platter: Funds of funds
Hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds are designed 
for investors who have lots of money to put to work. The problem is that the 
minimum investments can be so high that even those who can afford to buy 
the funds may not have enough money to afford a diversified portfolio of 
them, or they may not have enough cash to get into their preferred funds.
A fund of funds is an investment pool that invests in several different hedge 
funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds, and it can solve some 
problems for the less-rich rich person or the smaller pension or endowment 
fund. The minimum investment is often less than a million dollars.
How funds of funds operate
Most fund of funds managers choose one type of fund and style, and then 
research different funds to find ones that meet their criteria.
For example, a fund of funds organizer may be interested in hedge funds that 
aim for absolute return by using macro strategies (that is, looking for invest-
ments all over the world to play changes in global financial trends). She will 
raise money from investors who also are interested in this strategy but who 
want some diversification to reduce the risk. Then the fund of funds manager 
will invest the money in 10 or 15 (or more) hedge funds that meet the style 
criteria and that offer good return prospects.
Funds of funds are most common for hedge funds, but they can be found in 
private equity and venture capital, too. Very few funds of funds cross bound-
aries among the three types of partnerships, but it’s not unheard of.
How funds of funds are responsible
If a fund of funds invests in several funds that meet the investor’s criteria, 
then it’s as socially responsible as the funds it invests in. It’s that simple.

Traps and Pitfalls of Investing 
in High Finance
Investors like hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital because the 
potential returns are huge. But with that potential comes risk and limitations 
for investors.
Private partnerships aren’t newfangled mutual funds that anyone can buy 
into, anyone can sell, and that report their results to the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission every quarter. A few of the limitations involve all the 
fund types and may prove especially difficult for certain types of activist 
investors. I explain those traps first in this section. However, some of risks 
are related to the structure of the specific funds, and I cover those last.
Looking at transparency issues
Private investment partnerships are just that: private. They may not want to 
talk too much about what they’re doing. The managers of a venture capital 
firm may be thrilled to make a big announcement after a deal closes, but they 
won’t utter a word before the contracts are signed so as not to bid up the 
price. Private equity firms have to disclose to the SEC as soon as they own 
5 percent of a public company’s stock, but they don’t have to say anything 
until the moment that happens. They don’t want to say anything either, 
because a private equity firm’s involvement can affect the value of a com-
pany’s stock price.
Many hedge funds use proprietary trading strategies that they hope no one 
else has figured out yet. For these funds, with their high fees and high perfor-
mance bonuses, it’s important to keep an edge, and that often means keeping 
information about investments private.
That’s all well and good unless you’re a social investor who needs to know 
what the fund is investing in. Many investors are monitored by others who 
also want to know what’s happening. A state employee pension plan may be 
forbidden to invest in companies that do business in certain world trouble 
spots. If that fund has investments in private partnerships that won’t dis-
close their holdings, then it is unable to certify that it’s in compliance with 
its requirements. A university endowment manager may be beholden to 
donors, students, and faculty who want to know where the fund is investing, 
and private partnership investments can interfere with those stakeholders’ 
interests.

279
 Chapter 16: Getting into High Finance: Private Partnerships
 
Some private partnerships will sign contractual agreements to concentrate 
in or avoid certain types of investments. Others will agree to disclose hold-
ings information to an authorized person who may not be able to disclose the 
information to anyone else but who can at least certify that the investments 
meet the necessary criteria. This may be acceptable to some types of social 
investors.
Considering the liquidity, or lack thereof
Private investment partnerships aren’t always easy to invest in. A prospec-
tive investor has to find a suitable fund, navigate the partnership agreement, 
and cough up a lot of money for the investment. Once in, the investor may 
well be stuck.
 
It’s not easy to make a withdrawal from these funds because many of them 
have long-term investment strategies. A venture capital firm may have to wait 
three or four years between making the investment and realizing a profit on it. 
Until then, the limited partners had better hope that they have other sources 
of cash to spend.
That lack of liquidity can cause a problem for investors who change their 
investment strategy. Some social investors change their investment criteria 
frequently, especially if they try to respond to different international crises 
(see Chapter 9 for more information about that). A hedge fund, private equity 
fund, or venture capital fund may not have the flexibility that some of these 
investors want.
Monitoring governance in a limited 
partnership structure
Many investors care a lot about corporate governance. It’s a key activist invest-
ing strategy (covered in detail in Chapter 7) and often a driver for private 
equity investments. Unfortunately, many limited partnerships have sloppy gov-
ernance practices. Investors can be so happy to get into the next big thing that 
they don’t ask questions, and the fund managers can be so greedy that they 
cut corners. Most of these types of fund are fine, but not all are.
 
So what can you do? The first is to check to make sure that the partnership 
agreement includes some oversight in the form of annual performance audits, 
an outside custodian to hold the securities, and the use of bona fide broker-
age firms for trading. The second is to do background checks and other due 
diligence on the fund’s key staffers before making an investment to make sure 
they don’t have a history of problems that will follow them.

280
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Pinpointing problems with each fund type
As I explain in the previous sections, just as private partnerships have a great 
deal in common in their investment strategies, so, too, do they have a lot in 
common in terms of potential problems for investors. However, each type of 
partnership also has its own problems that you need to understand before 
relying too heavily on one particular type of fund. Here I give you an over-
view of those problems.
Hedge fund pitfalls
Because hedge funds follow so many different types of investment strategies, 
some can serve the needs of social investors quite well. But not all of them 
can, and you need to know the risks before you invest:
 
✓ Hedge funds charge high fees, and it’s not clear whether most of them 
generate investment returns that are high enough to offset those fees.
 
✓ Hedge funds don’t have to disclose their investments publicly, and many 
will not, which can cause problems for investors who want some assur-
ance about where, exactly, their money is invested (see the earlier sec-
tion “Looking at transparency issues” for more on this point).
 
✓ Some stakeholders hear “hedge fund” and panic; they associate it with 
ugly trading tactics, high risk, and obscene profits. These people should 
be given a copy of Hedge Funds For Dummies (Wiley) forthwith.
Private equity pitfalls
Not all private equity funds will fit your definition of responsibility. Many of 
them intend to make over companies, which may lead to massive layoffs, rene-
gotiations of pensions and other employee benefits, relocation of operations 
to low-cost locations, or even shutting down the business and selling all the 
assets. This can cause enormous disruption to employees and communities.
Most private equity funds are upfront with investors about what types of 
businesses they plan to pursue and how they’ll change the operations. 
Investors can also investigate where fund employees worked before and what 
they did; a private equity fund organized by people who specialized in hostile 
takeovers at an investment bank will probably have a different perspective 
than one organized by people who have experience turning around troubled 
companies.

281
 Chapter 16: Getting into High Finance: Private Partnerships
Venture capitalism pitfalls
One of the biggest problems with venture capital is that sometimes there just 
aren’t a lot of good ideas out there. A venture capital fund can be formed to 
fund new green technologies, for example, but if no entrepreneurs have good 
ideas, the money won’t be invested. Many a venture capital investor has been 
disappointed to find that the money committed is never invested, although 
that’s better than having the money put toward worthless ideas.
Venture capital firms, in their zeal to put money to work, have been known 
to give start-ups too much money. It’s a problem most entrepreneurs would 
love to have, but it is a problem: Companies that have money to spend will 
sometimes spend it foolishly. Instead of spending money to attend trade 
shows, they’ll buy an ad during the Super Bowl broadcast!
Finally, the biggest risk of venture investing goes to the very heart of what it 
is: taking a chance on small businesses, knowing that most will fail but a few 
will succeed beyond the founders’ wildest dreams. Returns on investment 
can vary from year to year, and they can often be negative.
 
It’s not always sweetness and light in the venture capital world, because the 
fund’s goal is to make money. Venture capital firms have been known to come 
in and fire all the employees, make radical changes in a company’s direction, 
or even shut down a portfolio company if the venture capitalists believe it’s 
worth more dead than alive. “Responsible” is not a synonym for “nice.”
Funds of funds pitfalls
Funds of funds solve some problems inherent in the other types of private 
partnerships, but it will cost you. The first expense is that of management 
fees. Each of the underlying funds will have its own management fees and 
expenses (which are covered in more detail in the “Carrying the carry and 
other charges” section earlier in this chapter), and then the fund of funds 
manager will charge additional fees for his services. Those fees can eat into 
investment returns right quick.
Another pitfall of special concern to a social investor is the loss of oversight. 
The more people involved, the harder it can be to ensure that all the funds 
are managing money exactly the way they’re supposed to.

Making a Difference 
with Microfinance
In This Chapter
▶ Giving a hand up with microfinance
▶ Evaluating risks and ethical issues of microlending
▶ Finding microfinance opportunities
M
uch of this book is about medium and high finance: using socially 
responsible investment techniques to pick mutual funds, sort out 
bank loans, or make venture capital investments. To play, you need thou-
sands of dollars or more.
One of the most interesting areas of social investing doesn’t require thou-
sands or even hundreds of dollars. You can play for tens. It’s microfinance 
(also called microcredit or microlending), which involves lending small 
amounts of money to people who need the smallest of boosts to get out of 
poverty. Maybe the investment goes to a few chickens to launch a business 
selling eggs, a bicycle to help a lunch stand launch a delivery service, or a 
cellphone to help a fisherman find the best market for the day’s catch.
These are simple needs that fill enormous gaps in the global economy. In this 
chapter, I tell you about ways you can combine investing and philanthropy 
for your own microfinancing, whether it’s for profit or pure charity. The 
financial returns may be small, but they are real, and the social returns are 
infinite.
Looking at How Microfinance Works
In economic development circles, microfinance is defined as the supply of 
loans, savings, and other basic financial services to the poor. It includes low-
balance checking accounts, cellphone money transfer services, and simpli-
fied paperwork to accommodate people with low literacy.

284
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Without microfinance, poor people are stuck. They can’t get the money they 
need to grow businesses or receive an education. Banks won’t lend to them; 
local thugs might, but such loans can carry a cost that’s a lot higher than the 
high stated interest.
Impoverished people often have to keep what money they do have in the 
form of jewelry or livestock. Unfortunately, jewelry can be stolen, and live-
stock can sicken, die, or wander off. These items are hard to sell to raise 
funds; you really can’t sell half of a goat unless you’re ready to butcher it. 
Livestock can be productive, but jewelry doesn’t do any work for you. People 
living in these conditions end up making small amounts of money and putting 
whatever they do have in bangle bracelets or bullocks rather than making 
a return the way people in developed countries do: lending or investing 
unneeded money to those who want to improve their lives or start new 
businesses.
In the following sections, I explain who benefits from these small loans and 
how banks make sure they’re lending money to responsible borrowers.
 
Included in this chapter is a list of some microfinance funds and related pro-
grams that accept investments from individual investors. Some allow inves-
tors to get started for $25 and encourage people to open accounts as gifts for 
that hard-to-shop-for relative. (I started my career as a microlender with a 
gift certificate to a microfinance company that I received from my family for 
Mother’s Day; I loaned it to a dressmaker in Nigeria who needed a new sewing 
machine. We’ll see in a year if she repays me.)
Inspiring people to help themselves
A key tenet of microfinance is that poor people don’t want to be poor; they 
are smart people who are willing to work hard and who want better lives for 
themselves and their families. They don’t need handouts; they simply need 
access to the same financial services that wealthier people have, scaled 
down for their smaller resources. Just as the owner of a clothing boutique 
in the United States might need a line of credit to afford new inventory, so 
would the operator of a clothing kiosk in Ghana. The difference is that one 
is selling $250 designer jeans and the other is selling used clothing (possibly 
last year’s designer jeans from the same boutique where the owner tired of 
and donated them to a charity that sold them to an international distributor 
to raise funds).
Much of the success of microfinance has been in providing economic oppor-
tunities for women, who often have been shut out of traditional financial 
services no matter how good their investment ideas. Many of these women 
want home-based businesses because they retain primary responsibility 
for the care of their families and houses. Microfinance has allowed women 

285
 Chapter 17: Making a Difference with Microfinance
to sell homemade tortillas to local restaurants, open a beauty salon in their 
front room, or make traditional jewelry that can be sold at gift shops in tour-
ist areas. These ventures allow them to improve their families’ lives and 
increase their social and political power.
 
Microfinance isn’t just for international development. Many entrepreneurs in 
developed countries need just a little bit of money for their business, maybe 
to buy supplies to start a nail salon or computers to get a secretarial service 
up and running. These people probably don’t want enough money to qualify 
for a standard small-business loan from a bank; if they use their credit cards, 
they’ll pay higher interest than they might otherwise need to pay.
Setting up and funding microfinance 
institutions
With most microfinance arrangements, investors place their money in an 
investment fund (called a microfinance fund) managed in their home country. 
The fund managers then form partnerships with organizations in the com-
munity that will receive the money, known as microfinance institutions (MFIs), 
which have a better sense of the economy in a developing country than the 
investors do.
The microfinance fund is used to capitalize microfinance loans. The funds 
can be loaned directly with the help of an MFI, or they can be used as a loan 
guarantee fund that the MFI can use as a reserve. If the MFI uses the money as 
a reserve, it can loan out a larger percentage of its deposits than might other-
wise be practical. Some microfinance funds buy interests in the loans, giving 
the MFI capital to lend more money before the current loans are repaid.
MFIs are responsible for identifying borrowers with worthy projects, approv-
ing the loans, and collecting the payments. In some cases, the MFI eventually 
takes in enough bank deposits from its customers that it can operate without 
outside investors. Most MFIs also provide additional services to their com-
munities, ranging from business training to healthcare and preschools. Some 
MFIs are set up as nonprofit institutions and accept charitable donations to 
help them fund their nonlending support programs.
Researching small-business people
Loans of all sizes involve a lot of upfront research. Think of any loan applica-
tion you may have filled out over the years. You have to give your name and 
address and Social Security number. For a house, you have to include an 
appraisal verifying that the purchase price is in line with its actual value. For 

286
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
a car loan, you have to show your driver’s license and proof of insurance. 
For a student loan, you need to show proof of registration. Before cutting 
you a check, the lender needs to know that you’re likely to repay the money 
because you’re a responsible person and the money will be put to good use.
Microfinance involves similar amounts of upfront work. Applications are 
made, often by folks with limited literacy. Someone needs to verify who these 
people are, investigate their reputation for financial responsibility, and check 
on the project to ensure that it’s viable. That’s why MFIs have staff in the 
communities to meet the borrowers. Grameen Bank, the original MFI that 
started in Bangladesh, refers to its loan officers as “bicycle bankers” who ride 
around and get to know their customers wherever they are.
Creating and counting on collateral
Lenders want to know that a borrower will be able to repay his loan, so they 
look at the collateral that backs it up. This may be a bank account with funds 
that could be used to make the payment, or it may be the asset that is going 
to be bought with the loan. For example, if you don’t make your car pay-
ments, the friendly neighborhood repo man will come to take your car — the 
collateral — away.
Really poor people don’t have capital assets. That’s a defining part of pov-
erty. They don’t have a car that can be taken away or a bank account that can 
be seized. An MFI may be a socially conscious institution, but it still works 
with investors who are looking for a return. Microfinance only works if the 
loans are repaid.
One way that many MFIs help their poor customers create collateral and 
start building their way out of poverty is through compulsory savings 
accounts. Borrowers have to take a set percentage of their loan proceeds and 
put the money into a savings account. The money can’t be touched until the 
entire loan is repaid. So the borrower ends up with some new collateral to 
use toward the next loan or has savings that he can apply to whatever goals 
he has. Because the savings earns some interest, it helps subsidize the loan 
payments, too.
Another way MFIs manage the lack of collateral on a microloan is through a 
prompt payment incentive. This is additional interest charged on the loan, but 
it’s returned to the borrower if the loan is repaid on time. Like the compul-
sory savings account, it also helps the borrower generate a little bit of sur-
plus capital that can be spent personally or reinvested in the business.

287
 Chapter 17: Making a Difference with Microfinance
Some MFIs require personal guarantees, especially if the MFI is well estab-
lished in the community and has a network of customers who can vouch for 
new borrowers. With a personal guarantee, a third party co-signs for the loan 
and becomes liable if the borrower is unable to pay.
Joining with other entrepreneurs
Many MFIs require that their borrowers join groups of other borrowers. The 
relationships between borrowers give the new entrepreneurs organized sup-
port similar to the networks that businesspeople in developed nations rely 
on. The businesspeople work together to make their communities better, to 
share business ideas, and to help ensure that the loans get repaid. Part of 
Grameen Bank’s success resulted from the communities of entrepreneurs 
that were created in little towns all over Bangladesh.
Businesspeople the world over form networks to help them advance their own 
careers and promote their business and profession. I have memberships in 
the CFA Institute, which represents financial analysts, and Chicago Women in 
Publishing, which helps advance the careers of people working with words in 
my windy city. I get together for lunch with other writers and financial people 
whom I know, so we can share ideas, celebrate successes, and commiserate 
when things aren’t going well. Thanks to MFIs, people in developing countries 
can establish the same types of connections.
Some MFIs issue loans to the group rather than to the individuals in it. 
Others issue loans to the individuals but ask the group to guarantee the loan. 
No member of the group receives additional money until all the loans are 
repaid. This creates a network of people willing to vouch for the borrower’s 
responsibility. Think of it as a low-tech version of a credit score from one of 
the big American credit-rating agencies. It also generates some peer pressure 
to help ensure that the loan gets repaid. A borrower may be willing to stiff a 
nongovernmental organization backed by rich investors in Europe, but not if 
it means losing the neighbors’ respect. Even worse, if default means that the 
neighbors have to cover the loan, the borrower won’t exactly be welcome at 
block parties.
In addition to making loans and establishing entrepreneur networks, MFIs often 
provide training to groups of borrowers on such topics as writing business 
plans, setting prices, doing competitive research, and managing employees.

288
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Peer-to-peer lending
Some MFIs become so large that they no longer need the support of outside 
investors. That’s bad news for the socially responsible investor like you who 
wants to make money helping small-business people break out of poverty, 
but it’s great news for the MFI because it means the mission has been ful-
filled. An MFI that no longer needs outside investor partners is one that has 
generated enough growth in a community that it can now fund its own loans. 
As the entrepreneurs become successful, they have enough surplus funds 
that they can save some of them. The MFI can then lend those funds, generat-
ing a return for the local savers rather than for you, the socially responsible 
investor in a far-off land.
 
“But wait,” you may be thinking. “If people borrowed money and then repaid 
it, where did the community find enough extra money so it no longer needs 
investors’ help?” The money was created in the banking system. Here’s how it 
works: Say you put $100 in the bank. The bank is required to keep 10 percent 
on reserve, but it can loan out the other $90. You have your $100 deposit, and 
the borrower has her $90, so the total amount of money in the system is now 
$190. Voilá! That’s how savings can help an economy grow, in Boston and 
Bolivia alike.
To keep the focus on community development and individual empowerment, 
a large MFI will turn to peer-to-peer lending. Under this, the current borrowers 
and depositors decide if a project is worth funding. They help direct where 
their investments go. This gives the savers a bigger stake in the growth of 
their communities and ties the borrowers more closely to the source of the 
funds. In some cases, a successful group will have enough funds to make its 
own loans, and it can help the MFI by evaluating applications to determine 
who the new members should be.
 
This was the original model for savings and loans in the United States. These 
institutions collected deposits from local savers, made loans to local home-
owners and businesses, and had boards of directors made up of prominent 
community businesspeople.
Bracing Yourself for Microfinance 
Risks and Ethical Bumps
Microfinance is often promoted as the ideal solution to the problems of the 
poor. It builds financial institutions to meet the needs of ordinary people, 
creates new businesses that lead to economic growth, and it does it all with a 
taxable return to the investors.

289
 Chapter 17: Making a Difference with Microfinance
It’s a powerful method for making the world a better place, but microfinance 
isn’t perfect. If you’re going to invest in microfinance, you should think about 
the risks and issues involved to make sure they don’t bump heads with your 
values.
Because microfinance involves making loans to people who are at the lowest 
levels of wealth and income, the risk is great that the lender takes advantage 
of the borrower. That’s why some social investors are leery of microfinance.
The biggest concern is the relatively high fees and interest rates that lenders 
sometimes charge. Another big concern is that repayment of the loan is some-
times more important than whether the borrower received anything of long-
term economic value from it. (Plenty of people use their credit cards to buy 
rounds of drinks in bars on Friday night; they may pay off the credit card in full 
and on time, but it’s hard to say that any real economic development took place 
with that loan.) I cover these and other concerns in the following sections.
 
Poverty is a complex problem with no one solution. Microcredit can make a 
difference to some people, but not to everyone. It’s just one tool used to fight 
poverty, and it’s just one tactic that socially responsible investors and philan-
thropically minded individuals can use.
Dealing with high interest rates and fees
One of the biggest concerns about microfinance is that the interest and fees 
charged to borrowers are big relative to the size of the loans. A $10 applica-
tion fee, for example, represents just 1 percent of a $1,000 loan but 10 percent 
of a $100 loan. These rates can cause a lot of consternation to borrowers, 
who don’t have much money to begin with, and to lenders, who don’t want to 
be seen as taking advantage of already disadvantaged people.
MFIs look at a couple of factors when they set interest rates and fees. Here, I 
explain those components so you can figure out if a microfinance institution 
that you want to invest in is handling loans fairly.
 
✓ The cost of money: No matter how likely someone is to pay you back, 
when you lend money, you give up the use of it. For that, you want com-
pensation, and that comes as a basic interest charge. (In financial terms, 
it’s the risk-free rate of interest, the percentage rate you’ll charge even if 
you know you’ll be paid back.)
 
 Think of it this way: You may lend your best buddy $5 tonight that he’ll 
return tomorrow, but if you end up walking home in the rain because 
you don’t have bus fare, then he’s going to owe you big time. You gave 
up the use of that money, and it had a cost to you. The cost of money is a 
percentage of the amount borrowed; the longer it takes until the loan is 
repaid, the higher the cost of the loan will be.

290
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
 
✓ Default risk: Lending to your best buddy aside, there’s almost always 
some risk that you won’t get your money back. That’s the default rate, 
and it’s added to the risk-free rate of interest to come up with the 
quoted rate that the borrower pays. If 10 percent of a certain type 
of borrower always defaults, then the lender will charge 10 percent 
additional interest to offset that. All borrowers in that category will be 
charged that amount, too.
 
 Microfinance loans can have high default rates because the borrowers 
aren’t always savvy about business. To increase the chances of success, 
many microfinance lenders operate educational and training programs 
for their borrowers.
 
✓ Transaction costs: No matter where in the world the lender is or how 
much money is being loaned out, a loan involves a lot of paperwork. 
There are applications to verify, forms to copy, meetings to arrange, 
and appraisals to conduct. And all of that costs money. Some lenders 
roll those expenses into a higher interest rate on the loan, while others 
charge a flat fee that has to be repaid in addition to the principal bor-
rowed. But because the amount of work involved is more or less the 
same regardless of how much money is being borrowed, the transaction 
costs can look huge relative to the typical microfinance loan.
 
 The problem with transaction costs is that some lenders — macro- and 
microfinance alike — have been known to tack on fees for costs that 
may not be real as a way to boost their return. (If you’ve ever taken 
out a home loan, you’re probably familiar with all the mysterious clos-
ing costs that have to be covered before you get your money, and it’s 
entirely possible that you were able to get a few of them waived.)
Responsible microfinance involves charges that are proportional to the 
length of the loan. The charges may be high as a percentage of money bor-
rowed, but they should be justifiable. Here are some examples:
 
✓ Grameen Bank charges rates ranging from 20 percent for loans to entre-
preneurs to 0 percent for members of its beggars program.
 
✓ Accion’s MFI partners charge rates as high as 85 percent in Mexico and 
as low as 10.62 percent in Chicago; in both countries, that’s lower than 
what similar borrowers can obtain from competing institutions.
 
✓ The government of Bangladesh has a loan program that competes with 
Grameen; it charges 22 percent interest.
Of course, if you follow an investing style that forbids paying or charging 
interest, a typical microfinance arrangement won’t work. But even a micro-
lease or micro-equity investment will involve fees; check to make sure they’re 
proportional to the services that the small business receives. Ask the lender 
for information before you make your microfinance investment.

291
 Chapter 17: Making a Difference with Microfinance
Some well-intentioned MFIs have run up against local laws against usury (the 
charging of outrageous interest rates) because of their rates and fees. In the 
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU, made up of Benin, 
Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo), 
financial institutions are prohibited from charging interest rates more than 
twice the discount rate (the rate charged by the union’s central bank), set at 
a ceiling of 7 percent in 1996.
MFIs have successfully lobbied the central banks in WAEMU member coun-
tries to grant an exemption to the usury law for microcredit, so they can now 
charge up to 27 percent annual interest. The central banks recognized that 
microfinance is an important way to improve the economies in those coun-
tries and decided it was better to allow a high rate on microfinance than to 
lose the MFIs.
 
Think 27 percent is a high rate of interest? Check the fine print on any depart-
ment store credit cards you have — the rate may be awfully close.
The pain of repayment
Microfinance only works if the borrowers repay the loans. Otherwise, there 
won’t be money to lend to other deserving folks, nor will the investors 
receive the return they expect. Sometimes repayment becomes a bigger 
focus than spending the loan productively. That means that the money 
loaned may not contribute to economic growth, and it can have worse reper-
cussions in the community.
As anyone who has ever attended junior high knows, peer pressure can be 
downright ugly. A group that starts out supportive and helpful can some-
times turn mean and spiteful; the people who once were friends are now 
enemies.
Most microfinance programs rely on groups of entrepreneurs who share 
common business goals (see the “Joining with other entrepreneurs” section 
earlier in this chapter for more information). This is usually great because 
all the members can support each other and even share business leads. But 
sometimes the members can turn on each other.
The annals of microfinance are filled with stories of group members behaving 
badly toward each other, especially if one member is in danger of defaulting. 
If a member dies, there are rumors that others in the group will put social 
pressure on his surviving family to repay the loan, making a bad time in their 
lives even worse.

292
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
Navigating the obstacles of government 
and social status
Because the amounts involved with microfinance are pitifully small relative 
to the wealth of the people making the loans, some have argued that it’s 
almost immoral to demand repayment of $25 or so, money that means almost 
nothing to the lender and the whole world to the borrower.
There’s some evidence that the people who benefit the most from microfi-
nance aren’t the very poorest. They are the people who are a little higher 
in status and resources, who have a small but viable business that has the 
potential to become larger and take on employees. These people make great 
borrowers, but lending to them doesn’t alleviate the worst poverty. That’s 
why some people have argued that microfinance is simply taking attention 
and funds away from efforts that would help the world’s poorest people.
Other critics point out that people in some countries wouldn’t be so poor 
if their national leaders served them better. They believe that microfinance 
places responsibility for economic development on the citizens rather than 
the rulers who got them into their fix. Sometimes people are poor because 
they live under a government that is completely dysfunctional.
In 1998 Amartya Sen of India won the Nobel Prize in economics for his work 
on poverty. His key finding was that famines are failures of distribution, not 
of agriculture. If there are no roads (a government’s responsibility to pro-
vide) to get crops to the people who need them, for example, the people may 
starve. In any newspaper on any day, you and I can read stories about how 
foreign aid is being diverted, economies have shut down while dictators con-
solidate power, and senseless wars keep people hungry.
If this situation bothers you, then microfinance may not be right for you.
Running out of opportunities
Although there’s a lot of demand for microfinance in the world, it’s entirely 
possible that the supply of funds will outstrip it. When it’s so easy for rela-
tively rich people to put small amounts to work, the market can be flooded 
with money, and that’s not good. The money may be used for bad loans that 
don’t get repaid, and then the lenders lose their investment. (On a grand 
scale, this is exactly what happened in U.S. financial markets to create the 
crash in 2008.)

293
 Chapter 17: Making a Difference with Microfinance
Not every small business is based on a good idea and run by a capable man-
ager, and that has nothing to do with where it operates. MFIs with access to 
excess funds may be tempted to make bad loans to put the money to work. 
And if the MFIs don’t put the money to use, more investors may see low rates 
of return on an investment for which they already have low expectations. 
That may put an end to microfinance.
Locating Microfinance Opportunities
Microfinance loans may be small, but make enough of them and the total 
quickly gets big. It’s unclear just how big, but Accion International, one 
major microfinance funder, has a loan portfolio of $2 billion. Grameen Bank 
alone has more than $500 million in outstanding loans. Although microfi-
nance is hardly the largest sector in the investment universe, it’s big enough 
to accommodate most investors, and it will only get larger as the concept 
expands to other parts of the world. After all, this planet is home to billions 
of poor people, and most of them don’t want to be poor.
 
Even though returns on microfinance may be low, or even negative, the 
Internal Revenue Service still considers it to be an investment. You won’t get 
a tax deduction for your microfinance activities, and you may not make any 
money, either, for the worst of both worlds. If you choose to invest in micro-
finance, it should probably be with excess capital after you have provided for 
your big savings goals, such as retirement or a college fund.
 
If you’re researching microfinance on behalf of a pension, foundation, or 
endowment account, you’ll find that many of these funds accept institutional 
contributions.
Because of the fees involved, the percentage returns to investors from micro-
finance are small. There are potential returns, though, and it doesn’t take a 
lot of money to try it out. In the following sections, I tell you about companies 
that allow small investors to make small investments with folks nearby and 
faraway.
Taking action through Accion
Accion Investments (www.accion.org) is the money management arm of 
Accion, a nonprofit microfinance organization that helps match borrowers 
and lenders. At first, it concentrated on Brazil, but now it works with small 
entrepreneurs all over the world, including in the United States.

294
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
You can participate in Accion’s projects in two ways. The first is with its 
Bridge Funds, which are lines of credit that can be tapped by Accion’s local 
microfinance partners. The second is through Accion USA, its loan fund 
for American borrowers, who are typically recent immigrants who have no 
credit history here. Both investment options have a minimum investment of 
$2,000 and an 18-month time commitment. The interest varies between 0 per-
cent and 51/2 percent, depending on market conditions. Interested investors 
should call or e-mail Accion for more information, using the contacts listed 
on the Web site.
Contributing capital to Kiva
Registered users on Kiva’s Web site (www.kiva.org) can search for entre-
preneurs in developing countries who are looking to raise money for small 
projects. Kiva works with existing microfinance companies in areas that 
need capital to lend. Those companies screen the applicants; typical clients 
include a street vendor in Ukraine who wants to expand his inventory of 
sneakers, a man in Mexico who wants to launch an advertising campaign for 
his painting company, and a small grocer in Tajikistan who wants to add a 
meat counter to her shop. You can search the list, find a project that inter-
ests you, and contribute funds toward the total loan value.
Kiva is structured as a nonprofit organization, so it can’t pay interest. 
Instead, it offers investors the likely return of their investment, usually within 
a year, which they can withdraw or reloan to another entrepreneur. Because 
almost all investors get their money back, this is not a charitable contribu-
tion, even though Kiva doesn’t pay interest. The minimum investment is $25.
Making a little money with MicroPlace
Pierre Omidyar, the founder of online auction giant eBay, invests much of 
his personal fortune in microfinance, and he gave a $100 million donation to 
his alma mater, Tufts University, with the provision that it, too, be commit-
ted to microfinance. Then he wanted to find a way to let people with much 
smaller fortunes play in the market, so eBay acquired MicroPlace (www.
microplace.com) in 2006.
MicroPlace is a registered broker-dealer, so it can pay interest and dividends 
to investors. You can’t choose specific borrowers; instead, you choose a 
region that interests you and direct you funds to a microfinance company 
operating there. The minimum investment is $100.

295
 Chapter 17: Making a Difference with Microfinance
Investing endowments with Oikocredit
Founded in 1975 by the World Council of Churches, Oikocredit (www.oiko
credit.org) was originally designed to help congregations invest parts 
of their endowments into microcredit, helping the churches grow their 
long-term capital while doing good in the world. You can buy notes from 
Oikocredit for a minimum of $1,000 for one-, three-, or five-year terms; the 
interest paid is generally below market rates.
Oikocredit also works with MicroPlace (see the preceding section) to help 
smaller investors put their money to work.
Funding small businesses through Prosper
Prosper (www.prosper.com) brings the concept of microfinance home. It’s 
an online lending site, working with a federally regulated bank, that allows 
individuals to lend money to others. (Legally, it’s structured as the purchase 
of a loan rather than direct borrowing.)
Prosper’s borrowers state their case, including their credit rating. Some are 
looking for personal funds, but many are small businesses looking for help 
financing new facilities, inventory, or equipment. You then state how much 
you’re willing to lend and at what rate, bidding on the loan as with any 
other auction. You can commit as little as $50 and can earn interest on your 
investment.
Given the cross between microfinance and lending, it should be no surprise 
that one of Prosper’s venture capital investors is Omidyar Network, the ven-
ture fund of eBay founder Pierre Omidyar.
Get a little, give a little with Zopa
Want to help people close to home? Help someone refinance credit card 
debt, buy textbooks, or cover the costs of a divorce? Maybe Zopa.com (us.
zopa.com) is the microfinance company for you. It brings together borrow-
ers and investors in the United States who work through established credit 
unions.
As an investor, you purchase certificates of deposit with a minimum balance 
of $500. The borrowers receive personal loans. Then you look through the 
list of borrowers on the Web site and choose some to receive a cut of the 

296
Part III: Putting Your Socially Responsible Choices into Action 
interest from the CD, which reduces the total amount that the borrower has 
to pay. Borrowers who get enough investors to support their causes could 
end up owing nothing. In the meantime, you receive interest income from 
your CD.
The company’s name comes from zone of personal agreement, a negotiating 
term that represents the spread between the minimum that one side will 
accept and the maximum that the other side is willing to pay. (Zopa is based 
in the United States, but it also has affiliates in the U.K. and Italy.)

ant to be more successful in your social investing program? Then 
take it seriously! Investing in general isn’t terribly difficult, but it does 
require some attention. Social investing involves a bit more attention to ensure 
that all of your social and financial goals are met. But it’s not impossible.
In this chapter, I’ve compiled ten important tips to help you become more 
successful in meeting the goals that are important to you. Some cover basic 
investment advice worth remembering, such as diversification and research. 
But others, like keeping your perspective and making investing just part of 
your social goals, can help you find the balance you seek when you embark 
on a social investing program.
Diversify! Diversify! Diversify!
Problems can beset any company, no matter how it operates or who it sells to. 
The best way to protect your portfolio is through diversification. If you own a 
variety of investments in different industries, you can still work toward your 
financial goals even if one of them is having an off year. All the investments 
can be socially responsible; Part III has a long list of different investments that 
can meet your nonfinancial goals, too.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Do Your Research
Companies change in response to market conditions, customer preferences, 
and investor demands. Rely on a rumor from years ago, and you may shut 
yourself off from a really good investment opportunity. Do your homework. 
Take the time to find out about different investments and how they fit your 
social criteria. Read company reports, keep an eye out for company news 
in newspapers and on news programs, and talk to people familiar with the 
company (the next three sections cover these points). You may discover that 
today’s opportunities are a little different than you once believed.
Monitor Your Investments
Because companies change all the time, an investment that once fit your style 
may not anymore. Traditional investors are often content being passive, put-
ting their money into a mix of stocks and bonds, and then riding out market 
conditions. By definition, a social investor can’t be passive. A social investor is 
an activist! That means you need to pay attention to the news (see the next sec-
tion), read company reports and mutual fund shareholder letters, and ask ques-
tions when you can. Pay attention to what’s happening to your investments in 
terms of both financial performance and corporate performance. You may want 
to get out of an investment that makes money but no longer suits your style.
Follow the News
As you look for new investments that fit your investment strategy, pay atten-
tion to the business news. Many companies that you may have ruled out at 
one time may now meet your standards because of a change in management 
or the political climate. And new issues can crop up, ranging from product 
problems at home to wars and upheaval overseas. The more you know about 
current business and political events, the more you can identify good invest-
ments and refine your criteria to reflect the world as it is now. You may just 
find that keeping up with the news becomes the most interesting part of 
being a social investor!
Join Forces with Others
Although we’re told that it’s not polite to discuss money, it makes a lot of 
sense to discuss investments with others. If you can find others who share 
your social goals, you may find that your research is easier and more fun.

 Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Social and Activist Investors
You can look for a financial planner who respects your vision, a newsletter 
service that tracks investments by using your criteria, or a group of investors 
trying to get a company to commit to significant change (Chapter 5 contains 
information about this). Just don’t get into some cocktail party bragging 
game that keeps you from sticking to your investment plan.
 
A great resource for starting and managing an investment club is the National 
Association of Investors Corporation, www.better-investing.org.
Vote Your Proxies
For many investments, you receive a proxy statement each year. This tells 
you who the members of the board are, what the executive compensation 
package is, and what other key issues may be facing the company. Then 
you’re asked to vote. The process isn’t quite as simple as in a government 
election, and your vote will probably be small relative to all the other people 
who hold shares. But your vote is important. Part of being an activist inves-
tor is taking action and letting the company management know that you’re 
paying attention. (Chapter 5 covers proxies in more detail.)
Consider Your Spending
If you want to support businesses that do right by the world at large, you can 
do better than investing in them — you can buy their goods and services. 
The hardest thing for any company to do is to come up with something to sell 
that people are willing the pay for. The second hardest thing is to come up 
with something that people are willing to pay enough for to let the business 
cover its costs and make a profit. You can support different social values by 
the ways you spend your money, not just by how you invest. And, of course, 
the money you save by not buying things you don’t support can help fund 
your investment program!
Keep Your Perspective
Confusing money with values can cause all kinds of problems. Some social 
investors seem happiest if their investments lose money, because that makes 
them feel like they’re better than someone who has profitable investments. 
Others stick with bad investments, believing that any company that supports 
their way of thinking has to become a great investment eventually. If they just 
stick with it long enough, they know their commitment and good virtue will 
be rewarded.

302
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
The stock doesn’t know you own it, traders like to say. Just because you’ve 
found a company that matches your values perfectly doesn’t mean it’s going 
to perform well. And just because you’ve found a company that makes tons 
of money doesn’t mean it’s run by bad people doing bad things. Successful 
investors can detach their emotions from the market. That may be harder if 
you’ve invested in a company because of its alignment with your values, but 
you need to.
Make Investing Just Part of Your Life
Social investing is no substitute for voting, making charitable donations, 
doing volunteer work, and otherwise being part of a community of people 
who care about the world. Investing is one of many ways to do the right 
thing. Putting your money in a bank that specializes in community redevelop-
ment or buying shares in a mutual fund that doesn’t invest in tobacco compa-
nies can help you influence the world, but you may find that you can have a 
bigger impact in other ways. Social investing isn’t a form of indulgence. You 
have to lead your life first, in whatever way is important to you. Your invest-
ments are an extension of that, not a replacement.
Consider Your Estate Plan
If you care enough to determine where your money goes now, you should 
care where it goes after you’re gone. You need an estate plan. Besides making 
allowances for the people whom you care about, you can also leave funds for 
the causes that are important to you. You can do this through your will or by 
adding the organization as a beneficiary to your account. (In most cases, an 
account that is co-owned or has a named beneficiary will be handled outside 
of your estate.) Or you can find investments that support you now and the 
charity upon your death, through charitable remainder trusts and insurance 
contracts. You can find out more about those in Chapter 14.
 
Talk to a lawyer about your estate plan. In some jurisdictions, you may be 
required to leave a certain percentage of your assets to your spouse or to 
your minor children. If you decide to avoid all the headaches by dying without 
a will, then the headaches go to your presumed heirs, and the courts decide 
how your assets should be distributed — a total waste of all the effort you put 
into your investing program.

A
ll sorts of investors make all sorts of mistakes. Legendary investor 
Warren Buffett has made them; so have well-paid traders and average 
guys taking a chance in the market. Social investors are especially likely to 
make mistakes because they can let emotion take over, and emotion is the 
bane of every investor of every stripe. It leads to cloudy thinking and panicky 
decision making.
An easy way to improve investment returns is to make fewer mistakes. Doing 
careful research, staying up-to-date on your investments’ performance, and 
getting out when an investment is no longer working out can help prevent 
mistakes that drag down your investment performance. In this chapter, I 
point out common mistakes and give you tips for avoiding them.
Defining Investments Narrowly
To many investors, “social investing” means buying a socially responsible 
stock mutual fund, and then not worrying about it anymore. Other inves-
tors feel that they can’t invest socially because they don’t want exposure to 
the stock market. Although in the long run most investors are best off with 
at least some money in stocks, you have plenty of other social investment

options. In fact, diversifying assets across several different types of invest-
ments usually leads to better returns for a given level of risk. Chapters 14 
through 17 have information on how bank accounts, real estate, hedge funds, 
and other investments can meet socially responsible criteria.
Expecting Perfection in 
an Imperfect World
The perfect boyfriend, perfect job, and perfect life don’t exist. Neither does 
the perfect investment. You may have to make trade-offs between investment 
performance, social criteria, and time spent on managing your investments. If 
your standards are too high, then nothing will meet them.
Because the goal of social investing is to do well by doing good, you may get 
frustrated if your expectations are too high. Not only do very few pure invest-
ment opportunities exist, but you may have to sacrifice performance to find 
investments that meet your criteria. (The evidence of performance versus 
social responsibility is mixed; one issue, of course, is that each social inves-
tor defines the suitable investment universe a bit differently from the others.)
 
One way to meet your social objectives is to maximize investment perfor-
mance, and then contribute a share of the profits to the charities of your 
choice.
Not Accepting Neutrality
Most businesses and investments are neither good nor bad. They just are. 
They may neither add to nor detract from your social goals, so they’re con-
sidered socially neutral. And some investors have a really hard time with that. 
They want to sort the world into good and bad: Good company! Bad company. 
Good bank! Bad bank. And so on. But just as perfection is nonexistent (see the 
preceding section), investing also comes with a huge amount of gray area.
Although socially responsible versions of most finance and investment prod-
ucts are available, you may not always be able to find one when you need 
it. That’s okay. You won’t be a bad person for going with a socially neutral 
vendor. Just keep an eye on changes with your neutral investment to make 
sure it doesn’t go from neutral to worse.

 Chapter 19: Ten Investment Traps and How to Avoid Them
Falling in Love with the Company
You found a company that makes all of its products from reused and recy-
cled materials, that has the smallest carbon footprint in the market, that has 
the most generous employee benefits, that makes all of its products in union-
ized manufacturing plants, and that is a model of corporate governance. So 
why’s the stock so lousy? Maybe no one wants to buy its products at a price 
that covers all of its costs. As a social investor, you can get so caught up in 
all the good things that a company is doing that you can completely lose 
sight of your goal, which is to make money.
Furthermore, no company is going to do well just because you own it, but 
you really hope that the business will turn around, and you know that man-
agement will come through for you because you are such a nice person who 
is so committed to the social mission. You just know things will work out!
 
Unbridled optimism doesn’t work with relationships, and it doesn’t work in 
investing. You can’t wish and hope for good performance. Sometimes your best 
choice is to sell the stock and move on to the next investment opportunity.
Relying on Old Research
Companies change. A new management team comes in, a big acquisition 
takes place, and a strategy is adapted to new market realities. But the 
rumors persist: “Do you know what the company did in the Vietnam War?” 
“I remember protesting their sweatshops when I was in college.” “The nuns 
at my grade school led a big boycott of their products because of how they 
marketed infant formula in developing countries.” All of these stories may 
be true, but they may have no bearing on what the companies involved do 
today. The past has passed, and during the period in question, the company 
may have been directed by people who are no longer coming into the office, 
let alone still alive.
On the other hand, a company that has a responsible reputation can back-
slide so it no longer fits your criteria. An automaker may quietly abandon an 
alternative fuels program that it once promoted to customers and investors; 
a bank may cut back on lending to underserved communities when the credit 
markets get tight; or a model international manufacturing facility gets sold to 
a subcontractor offering a different pay-and-benefits package.

306
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
To be a successful social investor, you have to pay attention to the changing 
financial and operating climate. A company that once met your definition of 
responsibility may not now. A stock that you once would have avoided and 
a product that you once would have boycotted may now be something you 
should support. Research is ongoing; it doesn’t end when you make your buy 
or sell decision. (See Chapters 4 and 5 for more tips about researching compa-
nies and applying that information.)
Paying Excessive Fees
Some brokers, financial planners, and investment companies love social 
investing, not because they want to change the world, but because it gives 
them an excuse to charge higher fees. They sometimes reason that a socially 
responsible portfolio is so important to the customers that they’ll pay more 
than an investor who doesn’t care about the ethics behind the investments.
Some social investment styles require more research than others, and 
research can be expensive. If a mutual fund company sends its analysts to 
far-off countries to check on the conditions workers face, then the trip’s costs 
will show up in the fund expenses. That form of research isn’t cheap. On the 
other hand, a governance investment style that tracks such matters as CEO 
compensation and board members’ meeting attendance is relatively less 
expensive; all of that information is public and can be checked by anyone 
with Internet access or a library card.
 
Fees come out of performance. A financial advisor or research consultant who 
adds value and helps you make decisions deserves to be compensated, but 
not all are helpful. First decide if you need assistance before you pay for it.
Sacrificing Performance
The knock on socially responsible investing is that it leads to poor investment 
performance. That’s not true if you invest carefully, screening for both finan-
cial and social criteria. (You can find out more about screening in Chapter 4.) 
Many social factors can lead to better performance: Good corporate gover-
nance practices help management work for shareholders, sustainable manu-
facturing practices can reduce costs, and clean business practices around the 
world can help a company keep a good reputation with customers.

307
 Chapter 19: Ten Investment Traps and How to Avoid Them
You shouldn’t sacrifice performance because you don’t have to. If an invest-
ment offers below-average returns for its type, then don’t buy it just because 
it’s socially responsible. Keep looking, and you may find a stock, mutual fund, 
or real estate investment trust that has both good performance prospects 
and a social commitment. Or you can find a socially neutral one that meets 
your performance needs.
Forgetting that Everyone’s 
Preferences Cancel Out
Some social investors want nothing to do with defense contractors because 
they want their investing to support peace. Others like defense contrac-
tors because many of the companies treat their employees well, contribute 
to their communities, and are committed to transparency and responsible 
corporate governance. With so many varied preferences out there, company 
management doesn’t know how to make changes.
And that’s one of the key limitations to social investing. Unless investment 
activism is carefully coordinated and publicized, it often slips into a feel-good 
exercise. Traders refer to social investing as a noise factor — a buzz in the 
background that doesn’t change anything. Investors’ different preferences, 
whether they stem from environmental policies or how cute the CEO is, 
cancel out and leave pure risk and pure return.
The fact that people’s preferences cancel each other out is no reason not to 
invest in support of your values; that’s exactly what you should be doing. 
Just keep in mind that your investment choices may not change the world.
Letting Your Investments 
Do Your Activism
Your investments are just one part of your life — an important part, but just 
one. While you’re saving for the down payment on a house, college tuition, 
and retirement, you also have to work and play and contribute to your com-
munity. If you care about something, it should be reflected in your entire life. 
A socially responsible investment isn’t an indulgence that offsets what else 
you’re doing.

308
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Most activist investing success stories use shareholder activism as just one 
of the tools in an overall protest. South African divestment, for example, was 
based on institutions refusing to invest in companies that did business with 
the former regime there, but it included product boycotts, student protests, 
and extensive publicity about the evils of apartheid and the treatment of 
people who opposed it. It proved to be successful, but not just because of 
the behavior of investors. (I like to think that the red armband I wore during 
the spring quarter of 1986 had something to do with it, too, but it probably 
didn’t.)
Expecting Companies to Do 
the Work of Government
Many investors put pressure on companies to do things that government 
should be doing. They want companies to make better financial disclosures, 
even though those disclosures aren’t required. They want companies to 
meet certain fuel-efficiency standards that aren’t called for by law. They want 
companies to stop hiring child labor, even though it may be allowed in some 
places.
Financial disclosure and fuel efficiency are good things, and child labor is a 
bad thing, and pretty much anyone you talk to will be in general agreement. 
But it’s misplaced activism to give companies the burdens of government. 
It may not be fair to a company, either, in a ruthlessly competitive market. 
If you’re dissatisfied with your government’s policies, then the best route is 
political activism, not investment activism.

eing a responsible investor might make you feel good, but it’s even better 
if it allows you to do good. Does it? Yes! Activist investing strategies have 
often forced companies to change their business practices, improve conditions 
for employees, and create new investment products to meet different people’s 
needs. To inspire you on your quest to do well while doing good, here’s a list of 
some of the many activist and social investing success stories.
Disney and Corporate Governance
The California Public Employees Retirement System, known as CalPERS, is 
the largest pension plan in the world. The fund’s managers are committed 
to investing some of its assets in California companies, but they won’t stand 
by when they see mismanagement. Another part of CalPERS’s strategy is to 
press companies for management and governance changes when it sees a 
record of problems that lead to poor stock price performance.
In 2004, CalPERS added Disney (NYSE: DIS) to its focus list, arguing that the 
company underperformed the S&P 500 index even while its senior executives 
were collecting enormous bonuses. Given that the pension fund owned more 
than nine million shares, this was leading to real losses for the plan beneficiaries. 
CalPERS organized a group of other institutional investors to add more indepen-
dent directors to the board, develop a succession plan to replace the CEO and 
chairman of the board, and tie employee compensation to performance. Disney’s 
management acquiesced, and the company’s stock beat the market in 2006.

DeQingYuan
The chicken business is messy, even in the United States. It’s a commodity 
business, which means that most customers care about price more than any 
other factor. Human and animal rights activists and environmentalists have 
long been concerned about cramped cages for the chickens, poor working 
conditions for employees, and solid waste streams that seem to go along with 
chickens no matter who is raising them or where.
DeQingYuan (www.dqy.com.cn) is a Chinese chicken processing company. 
Its founder, Zhong Kaimin, has the company produce eggs stamped with the 
date they were laid to show how fresh they are. Chickens are raised in roomy 
cages and fed well. Chicken waste is turned into high quality organic fertilizer 
that’s sold to local farmers to grow corn for the company’s chicken feed. The 
local farmers make more money by growing corn than they could by growing 
chickens, so DeQingYuan’s chickens are protected from contagious diseases, 
allowing the company to use fewer antibiotics and lose fewer chickens to 
disease. DeQingYuan provides workers with healthcare; it also uses high-tech 
equipment to tackle ammonia and dust problems on its farms to minimize 
employee health problems.
DeQingYuan’s socially and environmentally conscious management are 
attracting the interest of foreign investors, including the International 
Finance Corporation, the industrial lending arm of the World Bank. 
Availability of foreign capital has allowed the company to contemplate 
a public offering in 2009 to give it access to capital it will need to further 
expand operations nationally.
South African Divestment
For decades, the Republic of South Africa was ruled by the white descen-
dants of the original Dutch and English colonists, despite the fact that the 
majority of the people in the country were African natives. This was a system 
known as apartheid, from the Afrikaans (Dutch) word for “separateness.” 
No surprise, the majority resented this and rebelled, causing the minority 
government to crack down on the people. Among other atrocities, Nelson 
Mandela, the leader of the African National Congress, was imprisoned, and 
another activist, Stephen Biko, was killed in prison.
South Africa also had what few other African nations did: a developed con-
sumer economy that was attractive to international companies. By the early 
1980s, people looking for a way to force the apartheid rulers to accept demo-
cratic rule shifted their attention to the companies that were doing business 

311
 Chapter 20: Ten Socially Responsible Investing Success Stories
in South Africa. They pushed major institutional investors, including univer-
sity pension funds and charitable endowments, to sell their holdings in com-
panies that did business in South Africa.
Although not everyone sold, the issue came up enough that it put companies 
on the defensive. Managers had to justify why they were still in South Africa 
even though their stock prices were being dragged down because of it. The 
executives started putting pressure on the South African government to 
make changes that would make it easier for companies to stay in South Africa 
and even expand their businesses there.
By 1990, Mandela was released from prison after 27 years, and the government 
began a peaceful transition to democracy. In 1993, Mandela shared the Nobel 
Peace Prize with Frederik Willem de Klerk, the last apartheid president of South 
Africa. Investor pressure helped hasten nonviolent change in South Africa, and 
many activists see that as a model for motivating other investors for change.
Shell and Nigeria
Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RD) is a major oil company with operations all over 
the world. In 1957, oil was discovered in Nigeria’s Niger Delta. The problem 
is that the Nigerian government hasn’t always behaved responsibly toward 
its citizens, and because of Shell’s business interests in the country, many 
have accused the company of siding with the government. The people who 
lived in the Niger Delta lost their land to government appropriation and were 
compensated based on the value of the crops grown on it, not the oil and gas 
reserves underneath. Then Shell hired very few local workers. Environmental 
contamination from drilling operations affected farmlands and fisheries, and 
displaced many local residents.
Because of Shell’s questionable environmental and human rights actions in 
the Niger Delta, local groups formed to oppose Shell’s practices, and they 
were soon joined by socially conscious activists in a boycott of Shell prod-
ucts. Actions brought oil production in the region to a halt in 1992. In 1995, 
opposition leader Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other people were killed, prompt-
ing condemnation by such world leaders as U.S. President Bill Clinton, South 
African President Nelson Mandela, England’s Queen Elizabeth II, and British 
Prime Minister John Major. Several environmental groups, including Friends 
of the Earth and Greenpeace, bought shares in Shell stock and began filing 
shareholder resolutions to bring their priorities before the shareholders. 
Eventually, Shell committed to spending $100 million per year for five years 
on social development and oil spill cleanup projects in the Niger Delta. This 
led to peaceful relations for a while, although tensions between Shell and dif-
ferent Nigerian groups seem to be reigniting as of press time.

AXA and Land Mines
AXA (NYSE: AXA) is a global insurance company headquartered in the 
Netherlands. In 2005, it attracted the attention of activists because the com-
pany invested some of its money in weapons manufacturers that made anti-
personnel land mines. The problem with land mines is that they can remain 
viable long after a war is over, essentially making swaths of land uninhabit-
able for decades and killing or maiming children who, unaware of the danger, 
wander out to play. Because of the long-term effects on civilians, many 
people think land mines are an especially heinous form of weaponry.
AXA initially rejected calls that it divest its holdings in these companies, but 
by 2006, it realized that not only were the investments affecting its customer 
retention, but it was also the wrong thing to do. The company announced 
it would accept the terms of the Ottawa Convention, an international treaty 
that prohibits the production and sale of antipersonnel land mines, and that 
it would no longer invest in companies that made them.
Pepsico and Myanmar
Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, has been the scene for much political 
unrest. In 1988, the military cracked down on people protesting for democ-
racy, including the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi, who would win the Nobel 
Peace Prize in 1991. In 1990, elections were held, and the democracy side 
won 82 percent of the popular vote, but the military regime didn’t relinquish 
power. Despite the political turmoil and human rights violations, Pepsico 
(NYSE: PEP) entered into a joint venture with Thein Tun, who had ties to the 
military junta, and opened a bottling plant near Rangoon in 1991.
To get its profits out of Myanmar and into the U.S., Pepsico purchased 
Myanmarian agricultural goods for export, despite the common use of forced 
labor in the country’s agricultural sector. The company argued that interna-
tional trade would open the country up for international development and 
lead to an end of repression. Democracy activists and protesters countered 
that Pepsico’s presence and willingness to do business with the junta gave 
hard currency and legitimacy to the repressive military regime.
Activists in the United States and Europe responded. Along with boycotts 
and campus protests, the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility orga-
nized institutional and individual shareholders to argue that Pepsico should 
divest from Myanmar. They introduced shareholder resolutions to force the 
issue. Forced to choose between unhappy shareholders and questionable 
business opportunities abroad, Pepsico withdrew from Myanmar, and the 
shareholder resolutions were dropped.

Nike and Sweatshops
Many companies contract with others to do manufacturing, figuring that 
marketing and design are very different skills than managing an assembly 
operation. These contracts often go to low bidders who then have an incen-
tive to run the operation as cheaply as possible, treating workers terribly in 
the process. Because there are so many contract manufacturers out there, 
it’s hard to police them all. Many consumers look the other way when they’re 
paying bargain prices, but if they’re paying top dollar, they expect some of 
that money to go to the workers.
Nike (NYSE: NKE) is known for making high performance sneakers sold at 
high prices. Hence, labor activists were especially outraged to discover 
that the people who made the shoes were often paid low wages and worked 
in dangerous conditions. Although Nike wasn’t operating the factories, it 
was paying people to do its manufacturing and thus had the ability to force 
accountability. The company resisted at first, leading many socially respon-
sible pension, endowment, and mutual funds to sell the shares. Eventually, 
though, the company changed its contracting practices and began audits of 
all of its suppliers, and it’s now owned by many of the investment funds that 
sold it.
ShoreBank
Founded as South Shore National Bank in Chicago, ShoreBank (www.shore
bankcorp.com) was a community development financial institution long 
before the government created that banking category. (You can read more 
about community development financial institutions in Chapter 14.) The bank 
was acquired by a group of community activists in 1973; they were disturbed 
by the economic decline that affected much of Chicago’s South Side and 
believed the downturn was being hastened by the lack of financial institutions 
in the neighborhood. The bank was committed to making loans to home-
owners, small businesses, and nonprofit institutions in the area. Within two 
years, the bank was profitable; it became proof to skeptics that a responsible 
financial institution could make money by helping its community grow.
ShoreBank now has banks in Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, Portland, and 
Seattle. It continues to concentrate on community lending in disadvantaged 
areas, more recently emphasizing environmentally responsible development. 
And it’s been a model for other banks all over the country.

Grameen Bank
In 2006, Mohammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize, which was unusual 
because he’s an economist who founded a bank, not a politician or protes-
tor. However, the bank he founded in Bangladesh is unusual. Called Grameen 
Bank (grameen meaning “village” in the Bangla language), its mission is to 
provide financial services to very poor people, including making small loans 
to really small businesses to help people who want to work hard to get out 
of desperate poverty. Grameen Bank provides services to help borrowers 
succeed, such as training in how to create a business plan. The bank now 
has 2,504 branches in Bangladesh and has loaned out $6.9 billion U.S. Unlike 
almost any bank anywhere in the world, 98 percent of its borrowers repay. 
Grameen Bank’s success has led to similar projects in other places, backed 
by the capital of social investors. (You can read Chapter 17 for ideas on how 
you can participate.)
Shariah Mortgages at Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac
Islamic law, known as Shariah, forbids Muslims from paying or receiving 
interest (you can read more in Chapter 10). However, Muslims still want to 
buy things that are difficult to pay for in one lump sum, especially a family 
house. Several U.S. financial institutions have developed home finance 
products, including rent-to-own and joint purchase agreements, that allow 
Muslims to have the American dream while still honoring the precepts of 
their faith. However, these banks couldn’t offer terms comparable to those 
on traditional mortgages because they couldn’t securitize them through 
Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae (NYSE: FNM), or Freddie Mac (NYSE: FRE). The three 
agencies arrange for federal guarantees of mortgage payments, which make 
it possible to sell the mortgages to investors; this reduces risks for issuing 
banks so they can then charge lower interest rates to qualified borrowers.
Seeing a market opportunity, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac developed stan-
dards that would allow certain Islamic home-finance contracts to be guar-
anteed and available for sale to investors, thus expanding opportunities for 
Muslim homeowners and the banks that serve them. Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac have had their problems, but these financing arrangements weren’t the 
cause.

Magazines and Newspapers for Social 
Investors and Their Money
Several different periodicals cover the hedge fund industry, and one covers 
the world economy better than any other in the world (The Economist). Add 
these to your media diet to help you stay current on trends in the social 
investment world. When you’re finished reading them, be sure to pass them 
on to someone else or put them in the recycling bin!
 
✓ Barron’s (www.barrons.com): This weekly publication, a sister to the 
Wall Street Journal, covers the markets and financial conditions in depth. 
If you want a thoughtful analysis of the news and ideas for where to 
invest, this is the publication to check out.
 
✓ The Christian Science Monitor (www.csmonitor.com): This newspaper 
is operated by the Christian Science church with the mission of covering 
the world. It’s politically independent with an emphasis on substantive 
reporting of good news. This carries through to its business and finan-
cial coverage (with a section on money and values every Monday), so it 
may be interesting to many social investors.
 
✓ E: The Environmental Magazine (www.emagazine.com): E is a 
bimonthly magazine with features on every aspect of the environment, 
from vegetarian recipes to news about the plastics industry. If you care 
about the environment, this publication can give you a heads-up on 
business news and emerging issues that may affect your investing.
 
✓ The Economist (www.economist.com): A newsweekly published out of 
London, The Economist specializes in global business and politics, and it 
offers in-depth analysis of what’s happening in the world and why. If you 
have an interest in emerging markets and issues affecting multinational 
companies, it’s a must-read.
 
✓ Environmental Finance (www.environmental-finance.com): This 
monthly magazine examines the business aspects of climate change and 
other key environmental issues of the global financial industry, includ-
ing markets for carbon and alternative energy. This magazine is based in 
London and takes a European view of financial aspects of environmental 
issues, including green investing.

318
Socially Responsible Investing For Dummies 
 
✓ Fast Company (www.fastcompany.com): This monthly business maga-
zine isn’t inherently dedicated to sustainable or responsible companies. 
Instead, it wants to cover the most innovative businesses out there; in 
most cases, that means sustainable, responsible companies.
 
✓ World Watch Magazine (www.worldwatch.org): A bimonthly publica-
tion of the World Watch Institute, World Watch is devoted to various 
big-picture environmental and social issues that affect the world. This 
magazine publishes in-depth articles about various environmental 
issues and includes interesting statistics and quantitative information to 
complement the articles.
Blogs, Web Sites, and Other Online 
Social Investing Sources
The Internet has seemingly unlimited information on investing, business, and 
the wider world (maybe that’s why it’s called the World Wide Web?). Here 
are some of the many sites that may help you discover more about socially 
responsible investing; new sites are added all the time.
 
✓ Biblical Responsible Investing Institute (www.briinstitute.com): 
The institute provides data to allow Christians to align their investments 
with their faith. BRI screens about 2,000 companies for involvement in 
alcohol, abortion, anti-family issues, bioethics, gambling, homosexuality, 
human rights, tobacco, and pornography.
 
✓ Boston College Center for Corporate Citizenship (www.bcccc.net): 
The center approaches social responsibility from both sides. It provides 
resources for companies that want to be better corporate citizens, and it 
also operates the Institute for Responsible Investment to help investors 
make responsible choices. The site has a wealth of resources available 
to all, but some items require a subscription.
 
✓ Business of Green (blogs.iht.com/tribtalk/business/green): 
The International Herald Tribune, a European publication of the New 
York Times, offers thoughts and comments on a wide range of thought-
provoking topics. The site includes many good links to institutions and 
private entities.
 
✓ CSRwire (vcr.csrwire.com): CSRwire provides daily updates on cor-
porate social responsibility issues in a variety of industries. On a recent 
day, the site featured stories about social issues affecting pulp and 
paper producers, cocoa companies, the hotel industry, and electronics 
manufacturers.

319
 Appendix
 
✓ Environmental Leader (www.environmentalleader.com): This site 
bills itself as “the executive’s daily green briefing,” and it’s a good source 
for environmental news and information and how it affects business.
 
✓ Green@Work Magazine (www.greenatworkmag.com): This online 
magazine bills itself as the premier corporate sustainability publica-
tion. It’s aimed at corporate managers to help make the business case 
for improving their environmental performance. The site includes case 
studies and tools to help business professionals green up their acts.
 
✓ Icahn Report (www.icahnreport.com): Carl Icahn is one of the better 
known activist investors, regularly stirring up trouble at companies 
where he perceives that management isn’t standing up for shareholders. 
Some people love him, some hate him, but his blog is good reading for 
investors who care about good corporate governance.
 
✓ International Corporate Governance Network (www.icgn.org): This 
is a coalition of institutional investors, academics, and activists who 
share information about key corporate governance issues.
 
✓ Investopedia (www.investopedia.com): This site offers quick defini-
tions for different business and investing terms.
 
✓ Morningstar (www.morningstar.com): Want to know about mutual 
funds and exchange-traded funds? This is the place. Much of the infor-
mation is free, although many investors may find that the premium ser-
vices are well worth the cost.
 
✓ People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (www.peta.org): This 
organization maintains a listing of companies that don’t test products on 
animals and a separate list of those that do at search.caring
consumer.com. It’s useful information for investors who are concerned 
about animal rights.
 
✓ Point Carbon (www.pointcarbon.com): Point Carbon is an interna-
tional energy market consultant, and this site features resources about 
the global carbon, natural gas, and power markets. The site provides 
good technical information on carbon pricing and energy consumption 
trends, and news affecting the global carbon and power trading markets, 
including glossaries and primers for nonspecialists about how the mar-
kets work.
 
✓ Triple Pundit — People, Profit, Planet (triplepundit.com): This 
site offers intelligent and nuanced (and some not-so-nuanced) views on 
various environmental issues, as well as links for business and financial 
concerns on environmental issues.
