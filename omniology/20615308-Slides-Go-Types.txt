Go Data Types - 1
●
A type determines a set of values together with operations and methods speciﬁc to those 
values.
●
There are predeclared types, introduced types with type declarations and composite 
types: array, slice, map, struct, pointer, function, interface, and channel types.
Predeclared, Built-in Types
●Numeric types
○
int8, int16, int32, int64
○
uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64: used to represent unsigned (positive) integers.
○
uint is an alias for uint32 or uint64 based on platform.
○
int is an alias for int32 or int64 based on platform.
○
ﬂoat32, ﬂoat64: zero before the decimal point separator can be omitted ( -.5 -3. -0. 
1.4).
○
complex64, complex128.
○
byte (alias for uint8). 
○
rune (alias for int32).

Go Data Types - 2
●Bool type
○
pre-deﬁned constants true and false.
●String type
○
Unicode chars written enclosed by double-quotes.
○
A string value is a (possibly empty) sequence of bytes. 
●Array and Slice Type
○
An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type, called the element 
type.
○
An array has a ﬁxed length (we specify how many items are in the array when we 
declare it), but a a slice has a dynamic length (it can shrink or grow).
●
Map Type
●
A map is an unordered group of elements of one type, indexed by a set of unique keys 
of another type.
●
A map in Go is similar to dictionary in Python

Struct Type (User deﬁned type)
○
A struct is a sequence of named elements, called ﬁelds, each of which has a name 
and a type. 
○
 a structure can be compared to class concept in Object Oriented Programming.
type Car struct {
    brand string
    price int
}

●
Pointer Type
○
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
○
The value of an uninitialized pointer is nil.
●
Function and Interface Type
●
Channel Type
○
A channel provides a mechanism for concurrently executing functions to 
communicate by sending and receiving values of a speciﬁed element type.
