running OS X v10.2.8, 10.3, 10.5 and later will find references to these operating systems.
About This Book
Most of the chapters in this book include screenshots from Acrobat running under Windows. The 
user interface is closely matched between Windows and the Macintosh; therefore, Macintosh users 
will find the same options in dialog boxes and menu commands as found in the screenshots taken 
on a Windows machine. Where significant differences do occur, you’ll find additional screenshots 
taken on a Macintosh to distinguish the differences.
How to read this book
I have to admit this publication is not a page turner that leaves you grasping for more time to finish 
up a chapter before retiring at night. After all, it’s a computer book and inasmuch as my editors at 
Wiley always strive to get me to add a little drama to the text, few people will pick up this Bible 
and read it cover to cover. This book should be thought of more as a reference where you can 
jump to an area and read over the contents to help simplify your work sessions in Acrobat 
Standard (available only on Windows in versions 9.0), Acrobat Professional version 9.0 (both 
Windows and Macintosh), and Acrobat Professional Extended 9.0 (Windows only).
Because Acrobat is such a behemoth program and can do so many things for almost any kind of work 
activity, most people won’t use every feature the program provides. You may be interested in convert-
ing files to PDF and setting up reviews, or you may devote more attention to the area of prepress and 
printing, or perhaps it’s accessibility or PDF forms that’s part of your work. Therefore, you may 
ignore some chapters and just want to jump to the area that interests you most.
Regardless of where you are in Acrobat experience, you should be able to gain much insight and skill 
at using the new version of Acrobat by studying in detail those areas that interest you most. However, 
don’t completely ignore chapters that cover features you think you won’t use. You can find many 
related concepts falling under headings that are not exclusively related to the general topic for each 
chapter. For example, you may not be interested in creating accessible PDFs for screen readers. 
However, the Accessibility chapter also includes coverage of document structures and tagging, which 
will be important if you need to get the content of a PDF back out to an authoring application.

Preface
Because many chapters may include features that relate to the work you want to perform, studying 
over the most important features of interest to you and skimming over those chapters that appear 
to be less beneficial for you works best.
To begin, I recommend you look closely at the section in the Introduction where I give you my top 
9 reasons for upgrading to Acrobat 9.0. No matter where you are in Acrobat skill, be certain to 
understand PDF navigation, — especially navigating the new PDF Portfolio documents that I cover 
in Chapter 12. Look closely at the Help documents and the Help features in Acrobat 9.0 that I 
cover in Chapter 3. Pay particular attention to Chapters 3, 12, 14, 17, 21, 23, 28, 29, and 32, and 
35. If you’ve read the Adobe Acrobat 8 PDF Bible, these chapters contain much new material in this 
revision of the book. In many other chapters of the book, the text has been completely updated 
and revised. Some chapters have been rewritten to cover more depth in specific areas. For exam-
ple, Chapter 29 on Using Acrobat.com is a complete overhaul of this chapter and covers all the 
great new features you have for holding online meetings and sharing files on Acrobat.com.
Throughout the book are sections called “Steps.” If you find the contents of a given series of steps 
interesting, follow the steps to see whether you can replicate what is covered in that section. In this 
book, I’ve made an effort to expand steps greatly to provide you some tutorial assistance in under-
standing many concepts.
Icons
The use of icons throughout the book offers you an at-a-glance hint of what content is being 
addressed. You can jump to this text to get extra information, be warned of a potential problem, or 
amplify the concept being addressed in the text. In this book you’ll find icons for the following:
CAUTION 
CAUTION
A Caution icon alerts you to a potential problem in using Acrobat, any tools or 
menus, or any supporting application that may be the origination of a document to 
be converted to PDF. Pay close attention to these caution messages to avoid potential problems.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
The Cross-Ref icon indicates a cross-reference to another area in the book or to the 
CD-ROM where more information can be found on a topic. It is almost impossible 
to walk you through Acrobat in a linear fashion because it has so many interrelated features. 
Covering all aspects of a single feature in a contiguous section of the book just doesn’t work. 
Therefore some common features for a command, a tool, an action, or task may be spread out 
and discussed in different chapters. When the information is divided between different sections 
of the book, you’ll find a Cross-Reference icon that cross-references the current passage to 
another part of the book covering related information.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
An icon appears throughout the book where a new feature in Acrobat 9 has been 
added to the program. Pay special attention to these icons to learn more about what 
has been added to Acrobat 9, Adobe Reader 9, and Adobe LiveCycle Designer 8.2.
NOTE
NOTE
A Note icon signifies a message that may add more clarity to a text passage or help 
you deal with a feature more effectively.

Preface
ON the CD-ROM
ON the CD-ROM There has been so much added to Acrobat 9, I ran out of pages. Chapter 36 had to 
be placed on the book’s CD-ROM. Where you see this icon referencing Chapter 36, 
look on the CD-ROM of the chapter.
PDF WORKFLOW
PDF WORKFLOW Where workflow solutions are particularly applicable, you’ll see an icon indicating 
that the text describes tasks or features that apply to workgroups and workflows. 
This icon will be an important signal for people in large businesses, government, and education 
where large workgroups with common tasks exist.
PREPRESS
PREPRESS
Much support is offered in version 9.0 for the prepress and printing market. If 
you’re a design professional, service bureau, or print shop, take note of these mes-
sages for information related to prepress and printing.
TIP
TIP
Tips are handy shortcuts. They help you to more quickly produce results or work 
through a series of steps to complete a task. Some tips provide you with informa-
tion that may not be documented in the Help files accompanying Acrobat Professional.
The book’s contents
This book is about Adobe Acrobat Standard (on Windows), Adobe Acrobat Professional on 
Windows and the Macintosh, and Adobe Acrobat Professional Extended (formerly Adobe Acrobat 
3D) on Windows. All the content in the book applies to Acrobat Standard, unless you see a refer-
ence that a specific section applies only to Acrobat Professional or Professional Extended. Acrobat 
Professional features are clearly marked throughout the book so you know when Acrobat Standard 
doesn’t support a particular feature. In many instances I refer to Acrobat Professional to include 
both Professional and Professional Extended. When a feature is unique to Acrobat Professional 
Extended, you’ll find a specific mention of this difference.
Just about everything that you can do with Adobe Acrobat is contained in the chapters ahead. This 
book is not about Adobe LiveCycle Designer, Acrobat PDF Forms, collaboration, PDF creation, 
Acrobat JavaScript, or some other aspect of Acrobat exclusively. Some Acrobat features can take a 
book this size alone to cover in their entirety. What this book does for you is provide you some 
exposure and understanding for all that Acrobat can do. You’ll find chapters on Adobe LiveCycle 
Designer and Acrobat JavaScript, several chapters on PDF creation, and chapters on collaboration. 
However, any one of these areas is not exclusive to the content of the book.
I’ve made an effort to address many different uses for all types of users. This book covers Acrobat 
features and how to work with Adobe Acrobat Professional, Adobe Acrobat Professional Extended, 
Adobe Acrobat Standard, Adobe Reader, and companion products. Individual industries such as 
office occupations, digital prepress, engineering, enterprise workflows, and multimedia and Web 
publishing are covered. Regardless of what you do, you should be able to find some solutions for 
your particular kind of work. Whether you are an accounting clerk, a real estate salesperson, a dig-
ital prepress technician, an engineer, a Web designer, or a hobbyist who likes to archive informa-
tion from Web sites, there’s a reference to your needs and Acrobat will provide a solution.

Preface
To simplify your journey through the new release, the book is broken up into six separate parts. A 
total of 36 chapters address Acrobat features and some individual purposes for using the software. 
The six parts include the following:
Part I: Welcome to Adobe Acrobat. To start off, I offer some discussion on the PDF format and 
its new revision. Acrobat 9.0 has many new features — approximately 350 new additions have 
been added to the product(s). I cover tools, menus, and palettes to help you understand many 
Acrobat 9.0 features. This section covers the distinctions between different viewer types, navigating 
through PDFs, and using the Find tool and the Search panel to search PDF files.
Part II: Converting Documents to PDF. There are many different ways to create a PDF document 
and all these methods are thoroughly covered in Part II. I begin by discussing the ease of creating 
simple PDF files that might be used by office workers and travel through to much more sophisti-
cated PDF file creation for more demanding environments. One chapter is devoted entirely to 
Microsoft Office applications. In addition, I discuss how many application software developers are 
supporting PDFs through direct exports from their programs. I discuss the Adobe Creative Suite 
and how you can integrate PDF with the CS applications. The advantages and disadvantages of 
using all these methods are also discussed.
Part III: Editing PDFs. This section covers editing, modifying, and enhancing PDF files for many 
different purposes. Also covered are how to modify content and how to flow content between 
Acrobat and authoring programs. New features for combining files into single PDFs, creating the 
new Acrobat 9 PDF Portfolios, and redacting PDFs are added in this section. I also discuss scanning 
in Acrobat and converting scans to text with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using many new 
impressive features added in Acrobat 9.0. You’ll find much new material in Chapter 17 where I talk 
about scanning and OCR conversion. Document repurposing is covered in this section for users 
who want to modify files for different output mediums. Another chapter on all the enabling features 
available in Acrobat Standard and the Acrobat Professional products is included in this section.
Part IV: PDF Interactivity. Part IV covers interactivity with PDF documents for workgroups 
through the use of Review and Comment tools, shared reviews, adding interactive elements such as 
multimedia, and links and buttons. I address the layer features in Acrobat Professional and include 
a chapter devoted to making PDF documents accessible. Much new material has been added to 
Chapter 23 where I talk about multimedia and all the new support for Adobe Flash files.
Part V: PDF Publishing. This section covers distribution of PDF files in some of the more com-
mon means available today. I begin with security and authentication as your first step in document 
distribution and then move on to PDF workflows. I discuss creating PDFs for different kinds of 
distribution, such as presentations, and offer complete coverage of all the printing and prepress 
features. You’ll find new material in Chapter 28 where I cover using Adobe Presenter in Acrobat 
Professional Extended with Microsoft PowerPoint. I also offer information about eBooks in Part V. 
Hosting your PDFs on the Web and sending them via e-mail are also covered in this section. A 
complete rewrite of Chapter 29 was needed for this version where I cover sharing files online with 
Acrobat.com and all the features you have available to you with this new Acrobat 9.0 addition. 
This section concludes with desktop color printing and commercial printing. Most of the new fea-
tures for print production professionals are addressed in the last chapter in this section.

Preface
Part VI: Acrobat PDF and LiveCycle Designer Forms. This section covers PDF forms and han-
dling form data. For Windows users, I cover using Adobe LiveCycle Designer 8.2 in detail. All 
new features for creating forms using the new Forms Edit mode are now also available to Acrobat 
Standard users. These forms are covered in this section. Distributing forms via Acrobat.com, 
collecting form data, and running form field recognition are included in this section. 
Staying Connected
It seems like new products and new upgrades are distributed about every five minutes. If you pur-
chase a software product, you can often find an updated revision soon after. Manufacturers rely 
more and more on Internet distribution and less on postal delivery. You should plan on making 
routine visits to Adobe’s Web site and the Web sites of third-party product manufacturers. Any 
software vendor that has a Web site will offer a product revision for download or offer you details 
on acquiring the update.
Internet connection
With newer releases of computer software, an Internet connection is now essential. Programs, 
including Acrobat, prompt you routinely to check for updates over the Internet. To optimize 
your performance with Acrobat, you should run the software on a computer that has an Internet 
connection.
Registration
Regardless of whether you purchase Acrobat Professional Extended, Acrobat Professional, Acrobat 
Standard, or download the free Adobe Reader software, Adobe Systems has made it possible to reg-
ister the product. You can register on the World Wide Web or mail a registration form to Adobe. If 
you develop PDF documents for distribution, Adobe likes to keep track of this information. You 
will find great advantage in being a registered user. First, update information will be sent to you, so 
you’ll know when a product revision occurs. Second, information can be distributed to help you 
achieve the most out of using Acrobat. Who knows — some day you may be asked to provide 
samples of your work that might get you a hit from Adobe’s Web site. By all means, complete the 
registration. It will be to your benefit.
Web sites to contact
Obviously, the first Web site to frequent is Adobe’s Web site. When Acrobat and the Acrobat plug-
ins are revised, downloads for updates will become available. You can also find tips, information, 
and problem solutions. Visit Adobe’s Web site at www.adobe.com. Also make use of the Help ➪
Adobe Expert Support menu command in all Acrobat viewers. This command opens a Web page 
where you can order technical support for a nominal fee. For acquiring plug-ins for Acrobat visit the 
Adobe Store where you can find a comprehensive list of plug-ins and demonstration software that 
works with Acrobat. Visit the Adobe Store at: www.store.adobe.com/store.

I 
would like to acknowledge some of the people who have contributed in one way or another 
to make this edition possible. Barry Pruett, Publisher at Wiley, who filled in the role of 
Acquisitions Editor, was very helpful to me for getting this version completed. In addition, 
I find Barry continually interested in bringing new ideas to publishing that ultimately help the 
readers of Wiley publications. Barry’s support and enthusiasm for exploring new concepts and 
ideas are what make some of the content you find on the book’s CD-ROM a reality. A special thank 
you goes to my project editor, Jade Williams, who  nicely coordinated the project and kept things 
moving in a timely manner; copy editor, Scott Tullis; and editorial manager, Robyn Siesky; as well 
as the rest of the Wiley crew who participated in the project.
Once again I’m so fortunate to have my favorite Technical Editor, Lori DeFurio back on this proj-
ect. Lori is perhaps the single best advocate for Acrobat and PDF, promoter, and solutions provider 
to people worldwide than any other individual on the planet. With an incredibly demanding 
schedule that takes her to all corners of the earth, Lori finds time to review more than a thousand 
pages of text and can find things as small as a period out of place in a manuscript. As Adobe’s pre-
miere Acrobat and PDF authority, her technical expertise in reviewing this book was invaluable to 
me. Lori is always my first contact when I don’t understand something about Acrobat. This is the 
sixth book Lori and I have worked on together and my Acrobat books are always that much better 
because of Lori’s contributions.
A close second to Lori is Ali Hanyaloglu of Adobe Systems. Ali equally travels to many places evan-
gelizing Acrobat and PDF and assisting users on a daily basis. Ali is such a great support to me and 
his assistance was instrumental for getting this work completed.
Much appreciation and thanks also go to my good friend and colleague Leonard Rosenthal of 
Adobe Systems, who was a great help in walking me through new features and took time out of his 
busy schedule to review some of the content in this work. A special thank you is extended to 
another good friend and colleague, Thom Parker of Windjack Solutions (www.windjack.com), 
who graciously helped me with questions related to Acrobat JavaScript. Whenever I have a ques-
tion regarding JavaScript, Thom is my first and only contact.
I feel very fortunate in having so much support from many people at Adobe Systems who were 
continually available for comments, suggestions, and favors over a four-month period of time while 
Acrobat 9.0 was in development. The energy and enthusiasm of the engineering and marketing 
teams throughout the development period made it evident that this is a group of people with 
 passion and excitement for their work. A hearty thank you is extended to Rick Brown, senior 
Acrobat Product Manager (and Chief Acrobatist), for his support, telephone conversations, and 

xxxiv
Acknowledgments
offering a quote you see appearing on the cover of the book. I so much appreciate all the assistance 
Rick provides me, and the contact I have with him throughout the lifecycle of a product version. If 
there’s a glue that keeps the development team together through the rigorous schedule to make the 
deadlines, it’s Rick Brown.
Other Adobe employees who were very helpful include David Stromfeld, Product Manager, who 
spent time with me in a number of phone conversations and e-mails; Greg Pisocky for adding 
some pointers on Acrobat and accessibility; Randy Swineford, for a number of assists in getting 
familiar with new features; Joel Geraci for his advice and help with Adobe Flex and Adobe Flash; 
Chris French for help with many of the new multimedia features; Amy Wang who went above and 
beyond the call of duty by assisting me countless times on working through the new features for 
shared reviews and distributing forms — if it wasn’t for Amy, you wouldn’t be reading this book 
now; Gladys Liu and Tae-Ho Kim for help with some of the color management and printing issues; 
Ashu Mittal for constant assistance for getting things going with Acrobat and Adobe Reader 9 and 
so many debugging issues; and many other Adobe employees in the engineering and marketing 
divisions who graciously offered feedback and advice during the development of the Acrobat 9 
family of products.
Another Adobe employee so helpful in the area of the new PDF Ads for Yahoo! was Cynthia Tillo. 
Cynthia’s support and assistance in getting me started with Yahoo! Ads was invaluable and when 
she needed some additional assistance Mike McCullough of Yahoo! jumped in. Thank you, Mike, 
for your help.
I’d also like to thank Kurt Foss, editor of Acrobat Users Community; Stephanie Baartz-Bowman 
and Lori Kassuba of Adobe Systems; my colleagues on Acrobat Users, Carl Young, Jo Lou Young, 
Duff Johnson, Dimitri Munkirs, Douglas Hanna, and Patty-Bing-You for much support in keeping 
up-to-date information available on the Acrobat Users Community Web site and for their willing-
ness to help when I needed it. And in  my local Davao City Philippines Acrobat User Group, Chris 
Cubos, Blogie Robillo, and MiGs for all their generous assistance in helping organize Acrobat users 
in our area.
Additionally, I’d like to thank another friend and colleague, Robert Connolly of pdfPictures.com, 
and his client Aruba Bonbini for permissions to include the Aruba Bonbini eBrochure on the 
book’s CD-ROM. And again, I would like to thank my good friend Lisle Gates for permitting me 
to use his photos in several layouts.
Last, but certainly one of the most valuable, I’d like to thank the many readers of my previous 
works who through the years have sent me direct mails with questions, kudos, and helpful 
remarks that has helped me refine this work. My labors as an author, alone behind a computer 
writing daily, is really very dull during the project period. What makes it all worthwhile is hearing 
from people about real world applications for Acrobat and interacting with all of you — that’s the 
real treasure and the reward for me spending every waking moment putting this thing together 
over a 3 to 4 month period of time.

T
his book is the sixth edition of the Acrobat PDF Bible. As a result of feedback from many 
users, this edition is an effort to include coverage of some topics missed in the last version 
and to add additional material where users asked for more detail. As you will see by brows-
ing the contents of the book or launching the new version of all the Acrobat viewers, including 
Adobe Reader, Adobe Acrobat Standard (Windows only), Adobe Acrobat Professional, and Adobe 
Acrobat Extended (Windows only) there are many changes in the programs. As such, I’ve made an 
effort to cover as much of the new version as is possible in this single, comprehensive book.
What Is Adobe Acrobat?
We’ve come a long way in Acrobat evolution, and those users of Adobe Acrobat are familiar with the 
distinctions between the Adobe Reader software and Adobe Acrobat (either Standard or Professional). 
However, among the many users of Adobe Reader, there still exists some confusion about what 
Reader can and cannot do. When acquiring Adobe Reader, many folks think the viewing of PDF doc-
uments with Adobe Reader is the extent of Acrobat. Now in version 9, Adobe Reader can do much 
more in terms of editing PDF documents. In addition to editing features, Acrobat Standard 9.0 now 
includes the much desired options for forms authoring and enabling PDFs with special features for 
Adobe Reader users for saving form data and adding digital signatures.
For those who don’t know the difference, I explain in Chapter 2 that Adobe Reader is only one small 
component of Acrobat. Other programs included in the suite of Acrobat software provide you with 
tools for creating, editing, viewing, navigating, and searching Portable Document Format (PDF) infor-
mation. Regardless of your familiarity with previous versions of Acrobat, you should carefully review 
Chapter 2. In Chapter 4, you’ll find some details on all the new features added to Adobe Reader and 
how you can add to PDF documents some new Reader Extensions that enable the Adobe Reader user 
much more functionality than was available in all versions prior to version 9.
Acrobat has evolved with many different changes both to the features it offers you and often to the 
names associated with the various components. In earlier versions of Acrobat, names such as Acrobat 
Professional, Acrobat Exchange, and then simply Acrobat were used to refer to the authoring applica-
tion. Version 9.0 of Adobe Acrobat, fortunately, continues with the same product names as found in 
Acrobat 8 with one exception. Acrobat 3D has been rebranded and is now introduced as Acrobat 
Professional Extended. The high-end performance application is referred to as Adobe Acrobat 
Professional that operates on Windows and Macintosh and Acrobat Professional Extended available 
on Windows only. In release 9, as was the case in versions 7 and 8, there is also a lighter Acrobat ver-
sion of Acrobat called Acrobat Standard. As was the case in Acrobat 8, Acrobat Standard is available 

xxxvi
Introduction
on Windows only. Now in version 9 of Acrobat, Acrobat Standard has been overhauled and now 
offers much more functionality — especially in the area of forms authoring, This program has all the 
features you find available in Acrobat Professional with the exception of high-end printing and pre-
press, enabling documents with Adobe Reader extensions for commenting, and some differences in 
tools and menu commands. However, the degree of differences between Acrobat Professional and 
Acrobat Standard in version 9 has narrowed and you’ll find you can do much more with Standard 
than with earlier versions. As you follow the pages in this book, you can apply most of what is con-
tained herein to either Acrobat Standard or the Acrobat Professional products.
Nomenclature
The official name for the new release of the high-end Acrobat product is Adobe® Acrobat® 9.0 
Professional and Adobe® Acrobat® 9.0 Professional Extended. You’ll notice the registered marks 
appearing in the name. For the sake of ease and clarity, as you read through the book and see a ref-
erence to Acrobat, Adobe Acrobat, Acrobat Professional (also called Acrobat Pro) and Acrobat 
Professional Extended (also called Acrobat Pro Extended), please realize that the reference is to 
Adobe Acrobat Professional or Adobe Acrobat Professional Extended. For purposes of clarity, when 
I refer to Acrobat Professional, I’ll be talking about both Acrobat Professional and Acrobat 
Professional Extended. For the other authoring application, the official name is Adobe® Acrobat® 
Standard. When referring to this product I may use terms such as Acrobat Standard or simply 
Standard. Where it makes sense I’ll say it like it is supposed to be used; otherwise, I’ll use an 
abbreviated name.
The free downloadable software is Adobe Reader. Again, for the purposes of communication and 
ease, I may refer to Adobe Reader simply as Reader. Please realize, however, that the official name 
should prevail when you communicate in writing about these products.
For Windows users, Acrobat 9.0 Professional and Adobe Acrobat 9.0 Professional Extended also 
ship with Adobe® LiveCycle® Designer 8.2. You may find references to this product stated as 
LiveCycle Designer, Designer, or LCD. All of these references are made to the Adobe LiveCycle 
Designer product used for authoring dynamic XML-based forms.
Why is this important? Adobe Systems, Inc., has spent much time, labor, and money on develop-
ing branding for their products. With the different changes to product names and the different 
components of the software, some people using the products don’t completely understand the dif-
ferences or where the product came from. An Adobe Reader installer can appear on CD-ROMs dis-
tributed legitimately by users, and some end users may not know that it is a product available for 
upgrading at the Adobe Systems, Inc., Web site. Therefore, using the formal name can help users 
understand a little bit more about the software.
And there’s a very good reason for helping Adobe Systems with the recognition and marketing of 
its products. If the product doesn’t do well in the marketplace, you might one day see it disappear. 
You won’t want that to happen because when you start working with the new release, you’ll easily 
see many great new features and much more polish added to the programs. Adobe Systems has 
done well in bringing the entire Acrobat family of products to maturity and I’m certain you’ll find 
many more new uses for Acrobat.

Introduction
Above all, realize that Adobe is not a product. Adobe or Adobe Systems is a company. Making a 
reference to Adobe when you mean Acrobat or Adobe Reader is improper and promotes confusion. 
When referring to the products, be certain to include Acrobat, Standard, or Reader.
Adobe Systems and the Acrobat mission
Adobe Systems, Inc. began as a company serving the graphic design and imaging markets. With 
the release of PostScript, its first product, much development in the early years of its history was 
devoted to imaging programs, font libraries, and tools to help service graphic design professionals. 
When you speak to graphic designers and advertising people, they connect Adobe Systems with 
products such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Premiere, and so 
on. With some of these flagship programs having long histories and large installed user bases, 
some people may think that a product such as Adobe Acrobat takes a back seat to the high-end 
graphics and multimedia programs.
Where does Acrobat fit into Adobe’s mission and view of its product line? Adobe former Chairman 
and CEO Bruce Chizen was quoted as saying that he expected the Acrobat family of products to 
weather economic storms in the software market. Acrobat is Adobe’s fastest-growing product, 
experiencing between 40 to 60 percent growth in year-over-year sales. Chizen also stated that 
more than 60 percent of Adobe’s worldwide sales and marketing personnel are devoted to Acrobat-
related products from the Acrobat 5 life cycle to the present.
Adobe sees Acrobat as an integral part of its future and is investing much energy into Acrobat’s 
growth. With more than 750,000,000 installed users of the Adobe Reader software, Acrobat and 
the PDF file format are among the most popular software products available today.
Acrobat has become a standard in many different industries. In the publishing market many large 
newspaper chains, publishing houses, and book and magazine publishers have standardized on the 
PDF format for printing and prepress. The prepress industry has long adopted PDF as a standard 
for commercial and quick-print houses. Almost every software manufacturer includes last-minute 
notes, user manuals, and supporting information in PDF format on CD-ROM installer disks. The 
U.S. federal, state, and city governments and the U.S. government contractor organizations have 
standardized on PDF for everything from forms, applications, notices, and official documents to 
intra-office document exchanges. Also, PDF itself has become an international standard adopted by 
the International Standards Organization (ISO).
With the introduction of the Acrobat 6 product line, Adobe Systems expanded existing markets 
and targeted new markets. The features in Acrobat 6 and 7 Professional appealed to all kinds of 
engineering professionals. With the support for layers and direct exports from programs such as 
Microsoft Visio and Autodesk AutoCAD, engineers, planners, and architects welcomed the new 
additions to Acrobat. In Acrobat 8, users of Acrobat Professional could convert AutoCAD .dwg 
drawings to PDF complete with layers and comments without having AutoCAD installed on a com-
puter. Enterprises, in which document flows include different workgroups for almost any industry, 
welcomed additions to the comment and review tools in Acrobat Professional 8.0. Additional 
enabling usage rights for Adobe Reader users were introduced in Acrobat 8. The already standard-
ized prepress market applauded new features for printing to high-end imaging devices without the

use of third-party plug-ins. In Acrobat 9 you find all the great features of Acrobat 8 now being 
introduced with online support services and real-time collaboration. You find much integration 
with Adobe Flash and many beefed up features that were introduced with Acrobat 8.0.
PDF workflows
A workflow can mean different things to different people. One of the nice aspects of working with 
Acrobat is the development of a workflow environment. Quite simply, workflow solutions are 
intended to get out of a computer what the computer was designed for: productivity in a more 
automated and efficient fashion. Editing page by page and running manual tasks to change or 
modify documents could hardly be called workflow solutions. Workflows enable office or produc-
tion workers a means of automating common tasks for maximum efficiency. Batch processing 
 documents, running them through automated steps, and routing files through computer-assisted 
delivery systems are among workflow solutions.
Acrobat provides workflow solutions in almost every industry and new features added to Acrobat 9 
add some polish to an already great product. But the real advance in workflow activity is the intro-
duction of Acrobat.com. Now, instead of having documents flow across wide area networks, peo-
ple can collaborate in real-time online events without configuring servers. The introduction of 
Acrobat.com will not only ease a tremendous financial burden saving companies huge expenses for 
employee travel, but increase productivity in workflows through dynamic interaction.
New Features in Adobe Acrobat 
Professional
The changes to Acrobat in version 9.0 represent many more expanded and new features to an 
already impressive product. Just about everything you could do in the last version is still available 
in version 9.0, but there have been many additions to existing features and some new options for a 
variety of Acrobat uses.
More than 350 new features have been added to Acrobat 9.0. Listing all the new features here is 
not possible. However, in each chapter I’ve added a special icon to point out new features that will 
help you familiarize yourself with changes in the product and discover what’s new.
Rather than list all the new features, let me cover some of the more impressive new additions 
to Acrobat and point out some of my favorites. Here’s a list of my top 9 reasons to upgrade to 
Acrobat 9.0:
 Acrobat.com. I rank Acrobat.com and all the things you can do with this new online ser-
vice as the best new feature Adobe has added to any of its products in the past two 
decades. With Acrobat.com you have a free online service and online library. You can 
upload files, share files, engage in review sessions, hold online meetings in real-time, dis-
tribute forms, collect form data, and more. The service is free to users of the Adobe 
www.allitebooks.com

xxxix
Introduction
Reader and all Acrobat software. Chapter 29 has been completely rewritten to explain all 
the features you have with Acrobat.com and how to engage in online meetings.
 PDF Portfolios. In Acrobat 8 we were introduced to PDF Packages. PDF Packages have 
given way to PDF Portfolios. A PDF Portfolio provides you an opportunity to add a num-
ber of different files (any file type) to the portfolio. You have options for creating the 
design and visual look, adding Adobe Flash animation to a Welcome page, and display 
your collected files in a neat new interface that is attractive and powerful for users to 
browse the content. Look to Chapter 12 that has been completely revised to cover all the 
new PDF Portfolio features.
 Shared Reviews. Real-time collaboration on a server that you don’t have to configure 
makes shared reviews a quantum leap in Acrobat development. Now together with Acrobat.
com you don’t have to worry about talking to your IT department to configure a server. It’s 
all handled for you by Adobe and it’s a free service as you discover in Chapter 21.
 Forms Authoring in Acrobat Standard. Acrobat Standard has become more powerful 
with the introduction of forms authoring support. In Acrobat Standard you can now cre-
ate PDF forms, distribute forms, collect form data, and track forms on Acrobat.com. All 
of what I talk about in Chapter 34 now applies to users of Acrobat Standard.
 Flash Integration. Adobe Flash is all over Acrobat and PDF. You no longer need to use a 
Flash Player plug-in with the Acrobat viewers. Adobe Flash Player is hard coded in all 
version 9.0 viewers. You can convert Adobe Flash .swf and .flv files directly to PDF. 
When working with Acrobat.com, you’re working within an Adobe Flash interface. You 
can add Adobe Flash animation to PDF Portfolios. For more information on using Adobe 
Flash with PDF, see Chapters 7, 12, 23, 28, and 29.
 Scanning and OCR. Much new improvement has been added to scanning and recogniz-
ing text using OCR. Clearscan technology is supported with Acrobat.scan and support 
for Windows Imaging Architecture (WIA) scanners (Windows only). If you’re looking for 
suspect words after converting an image scan with OCR, don’t expect to find many sus-
pect words with the new improvements to scanning and OCR as I explain in Chapter 17.
 Adobe Presenter. If you’re an Acrobat Professional Extended and Microsoft PowerPoint 
user (Windows only), you get Adobe Presenter on your installer CD-ROM. Adobe Presenter 
is a PowerPoint add-on that enables you to export your slide presentations with animation 
and export directly to an Adobe Flash interface. You’ll be amazed at the new developments 
you have available for creating dynamic presentations, as you’ll see in Chapter 23.
 Commercial Printing Support. Several new additions appear with the Print Production 
tools in Acrobat Professional products. You can use the Preflight tool to create new Adobe 
PDF Layers, use the new Object Inspector tool, and find a huge range of new options for 
converting color. Look at Chapters 24 and 32 for more information.
 Adobe Reader. Adobe Reader 9.0 has become a much more useful tool and you’ll want 
to encourage all people not using one of the commercial Acrobat products to upgrade to 
Adobe Reader 9.0. With Reader 9 you can start a meeting on Acrobat.com, participate in 
real-time conferencing and reviews, and create PDFs online dynamically as you wait for 
the conversion. Adobe Reader has much more as I explain in Chapter 4.

Introduction
In addition to the top 9, you’ll find new enhancements and improvements in areas such as PDF 
creation, combining files into single PDF documents, redaction, batch processing, comparing doc-
uments, exporting PDF content, splitting files, forms distribution and tracking forms and reviews, 
LiveCycle Designer forms creation, converting Web pages to PDF, adding Flash widgets, and more.
You’ll find detailed descriptions of all the new features in the chapters ahead.

his section begins with an overview of the Acrobat user 
interface and familiarizes you with tools, menus, and pan-
els. In Chapter 2 you find a detailed description for the 
Acrobat viewers and how they are distinguished from each other. 
Chapter 3 follows with opening and managing PDF documents in 
Acrobat viewers, followed by Chapter 4 where I cover all the fea-
tures you find in the Adobe Reader software. In Chapter 5 you’ll 
find everything you need to know about viewing and navigating 
PDF files in Acrobat viewers. This section ends with searching 
PDF files using the impressive search features you find in all 
Acrobat viewers.

o start off this large book on Adobe Acrobat, let’s first take a look at 
what Acrobat is and what PDF is, and let’s try to get a grasp on some 
of the many options you have for working with PDF files in Acrobat.
What Is Adobe Acrobat?
Assuming you know little about Adobe Acrobat, I start with a brief description 
of what Acrobat is and what it is not. As I explain to people who ask about the 
product, I usually define it as the most misunderstood application available 
today. Most of us are familiar with the Adobe Reader software, which is a 
product from Adobe Systems Incorporated that you can download free from 
the Adobe Web site (www.adobe.com/acrobat/readermain.html). 
You can also acquire the Adobe Reader from all the installation CD-ROMs for 
other Adobe software. You can even acquire Adobe Reader from other sources, 
as long as the Adobe licensing requirements are distributed with the installer 
program. The Adobe Reader, however, is not Adobe Acrobat. Adobe Reader is 
a component of a much larger product family that has evolved through several 
iterations over more than a decade.
You’re probably a little more sophisticated and realize there is a major differ-
ence between these applications, and you may wonder why I even spend any 
time discussing the difference between Acrobat and Adobe Reader. 
Unfortunately, many people still believe that Adobe Acrobat is the free 
Adobe Reader program.
To add a little more confusion, Adobe continues to market several Acrobat 
products in the Acrobat family. While Adobe Reader remains a free down-
load from Adobe Systems, there are three additional commercial viewers —

Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
Acrobat Standard on Windows only), Acrobat Pro (on Windows and Macintosh), and Acrobat Pro 
Extended (includes functionality of the former Acrobat 3D and on Windows only). With the 
release of Acrobat 9, Acrobat Standard on Windows has been improved and offers many new fea-
tures formerly reserved for the Acrobat Pro product. As I talk about Adobe Acrobat in this chapter 
and throughout the book, I’m referring to Acrobat Pro for both Windows and Macintosh, Acrobat 
Pro Extended for Windows, and Acrobat Standard for Windows users only. Where the programs 
differ in features, I point them out. I also mention when a feature is only available in Acrobat Pro 
or Acrobat Pro Extended.
NOTE
NOTE
There are distinctions between the Acrobat Standard product (Windows) and the 
Acrobat Pro and Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows) products in terms of tools, com-
mands, and features. Most editing tasks can be handled in all viewers; however, Acrobat Pro 
does provide more editing features than Acrobat Standard, and Acrobat Pro Extended provides 
more features than Acrobat Pro. Throughout this book I delineate the differences and point out 
when a feature is unique to a given viewer.
Adobe Acrobat (Standard, Pro, or Pro Extended) in version 9 is the upgrade from Adobe Acrobat 8 
(Standard, Professional, and/or Acrobat 3D) and all viewers are the subject of the remaining chap-
ters of this book. Acrobat is the authoring application that provides you tools and commands for a 
host of features outlined in the following chapters. If you haven’t yet purchased a copy of Acrobat, 
either the Standard version (Windows only), the Pro version (Windows and Macintosh), or the Pro 
Extended version (Windows), you might want to look over Chapter 2 and observe some of the 
comparisons between the viewers. If fewer tools and features suit your purpose, you might find the 
Standard version satisfactory — but remember, Acrobat Standard is available only on Windows in 
versions 8 and 9. Although some of the features differ between the viewers, they both provide 
many features for editing, enhancing, printing, and working with PDF documents.
NOTE
NOTE
For the purposes of clarity, henceforth I’ll refer to Acrobat when features are com-
mon to all viewers. I’ll make specific mention of one of the Acrobat products when 
a particular feature is unique to a given viewer. For a quick comparison of the viewers and 
related features, be sure to look over Chapter 2.
Acrobat is an authoring application, but it has one little feature that distinguishes it from almost 
any other authoring program. Rather than starting from scratch and creating a new document in 
Acrobat, your workflow usually involves converting a document, created in just about any pro-
gram, to a Portable Document Format (PDF) file. Once converted to PDF you use Acrobat to edit 
and refine the document, add bells and whistles and interactivity, or prepare it for professional 
printing. In addition to the Acrobat program, Acrobat Pro ships with companion programs such as 
Adobe Acrobat Distiller, Adobe Acrobat Catalog, and Adobe LiveCycle Designer (Windows only). 
Acrobat Professional Extended ships with all the Acrobat Pro components and Adobe Presenter 
and Adobe 3D Reveiwer, Acrobat Standard ships only with Acrobat Distiller. These companion 
products are used to convert PostScript files to PDF, create search indexes, and author XML-based 
forms.

Acrobat solutions are greatly extended with other supporting programs from Adobe Systems and 
many different third-party vendors. If Acrobat can’t do the job, chances are you can find a plug-in 
or companion program to handle all you want to do with a PDF file.

What Is PDF?
PDF, short for Portable Document Format, was developed by Adobe Systems as a unique format to 
be viewed through Acrobat viewers. As the name implies, it is portable, which means the file you 
create on one computer can be viewed with an Acrobat viewer on other computers, handheld 
devices, and on other platforms. For example, you can create a page layout on a Macintosh com-
puter and convert it to a PDF file. After the conversion, this PDF document can be viewed on a 
Linux or Windows machine.
Multiplatform compliance (to enable the exchange of files across different computers, for example) 
is one of the great values of PDF documents.
So what’s special about PDF and its multiplatform compliance? It’s not so much an issue of view-
ing a page on one computer created from another computer that is impressive about PDF. After all, 
such popular programs as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, 
Adobe FrameMaker, and Adobe Illustrator all have counterparts for multiplatform usage. You can 
create a layout on one computer system and view the file on another system with the same soft-
ware installed. For example, if you have Adobe InDesign installed on a Macintosh computer and 
you create an InDesign document, that same file can be viewed on a PC with InDesign running 
under Windows.
In a perfect world, you may think the capability to view documents across platforms is not so spe-
cial. Document viewing, however, is secondary to document integrity. The preservation of the con-
tents of a page is what makes the PDF so extraordinary. To illustrate, suppose you have an 
InDesign document created in Windows using fonts generic to Windows applications. After it’s 
converted to PDF, the document, complete with graphics and fonts intact, can be displayed and 
printed on other computer platforms. And the other computer platforms don’t need the fonts, 
graphics, or the original authoring application to print the file with complete integrity.
This level of document integrity can come in handy in business environments, where software pur-
chases often reach quantum costs. PDF documents eliminate the need to install all applications 
used within a particular company on all the computers in that company. For example, art depart-
ment employees can use a layout application to create display ads and then convert them to PDF 
so that other departments can use the free Adobe Reader software to view and print those ads for 
approval.

Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
The benefits of PDF viewing were initially recognized by workgroups in local office environments 
for electronic paper exchanges. Today users have much more opportunity for global exchange of 
documents in many different ways. As you look at Acrobat and discover some of the features avail-
able for document comment and markup, comparing documents, support for layered files (which 
adds much more functionality to Adobe Reader), and preparing PDFs for screen readers, you’ll see 
how Acrobat and the PDF have evolved with new technologies.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
The term “screen reader” is used extensively throughout this book. When you see a 
reference to “screen reader,” I’m referring to either a hardware device or special 
software (JAWS, Kurzweil, and so on) used to convert visual information to audio format. For 
more information on screen readers and making documents accessible to the readers, see 
Chapter 25.
Document repurposing
The computer revolution has left extraordinary volumes of data that were originally designed to be 
printed on paper on computer systems. Going all the way back to UNIVAC, the number crunching 
was handled by the computer and the expression was the printed piece. Today, forms of expres-
sion have evolved to many different media. No longer do people want to confine themselves to 
printed material. Now, in addition to publishing information on paper, we use CD-ROMs, the 
Internet, file exchanges, and meeting sessions via the Internet between computers. Sometimes we 
use motion video, television, and satellite broadcasts. As high-speed access evolves, we’ll see much 
larger bandwidths, so real-time communication will eventually become commonplace.
Technology will advance, bringing many improvements to bandwidth, performance, and speed. To 
enable the public to access the mountains of digital data held on computer systems in a true infor-
mation superhighway world, files need to be converted to a common format. A common file for-
mat would also enable new documents to be more easily repurposed, to exploit the many forms of 
communication that we use today and expect to use tomorrow.
Acrobat Pro has many tools for helping users repurpose documents. Tools for repairing problem 
files, downsizing file sizes, porting files to a range of different devices, and eliminating unnecessary 
data are part of the many features found in Acrobat Pro. In addition, the PDF/A format introduced 
in Acrobat 8 is designed specifically for archiving documents. A standards committee has devel-
oped this format so documents viewed on computer systems 100 years from now will be compati-
ble with future operating systems.
PDF and Adobe PostScript
The de facto standard for nearly all printing in the graphics industry has been Adobe PostScript. 
While PostScript is still the dominant printing language, this will slowly change because Adobe has 
announced in 2006 support for PDF as the new print standard.

7
Getting to Know Adobe Acrobat

Okay, so how does PostScript relate to PDF? In the initial release of Acrobat, all PDF conversion 
began with a file that was created as a PostScript file. Users selected the Print command in an 
authoring program and printed the file to disk — thus creating a PostScript file. This file was then 
opened in the Acrobat Distiller program and Distiller converted the PostScript to a PDF.
Distiller is still a part of Acrobat. In some cases, creating a PDF from a PostScript file rather than 
through any of the many other means available may be preferable. It could be that you have a 
problem with exporting to PDF from a program, such as fonts not appearing embedded, or you 
may need to create a PDF for a special purpose such as printing and prepress. In such circum-
stances using Acrobat Distiller may be your best solution for generating a PDF document to prop-
erly suit the purpose.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information related to printing PostScript files and using Acrobat Distiller see 
Chapter 10.
Printing to PostScript and opening PostScript files in Distiller is used much less today because now 
so many programs support PDF creation through one-button clicks or using the Save As com-
mand. However, many of these one-button clicks still use the Distiller application in the back-
ground to create the PDF file. You may not see Distiller launched when PDFs are created in the 
background, but the program is working away to convert your authoring application document to 
a PDF file.
PostScript can be a problem solver for you, and you may have an occasional need to use it even if 
your workflow does not require its use all the time. The more you know about PostScript and 
Acrobat Distiller, the more often you might be able to rescue problem files that don’t seem to prop-
erly convert to PDF.
PDF versions
Acrobat is now in version 9. The version number indicates the number of releases of the product. 
PDF is a file format and with it you’ll also find a version number — that is, up until version 9 of 
Acrobat. The PDF version in versions prior to 9 related to the specifications of the file format; for 
the end user it’s usually not so important to understand all the specifications as much as it is to 
know what it does for you or what you can expect from it. If you create PDF documents for users 
of older Acrobat viewers and use the newer PDF format, your users may not be able to view your 
PDF files. Conversely, creating PDF files with the older version might prohibit you from using 
some newer features in the recent release.
PDF versions are typically referred to as Acrobat Compatibility. A PDF version 1.7 file, for exam-
ple, is an Acrobat 8–compatible file. To understand how the PDF version relates to the Acrobat 
version, simply add the digits of the PDF version together. For example, PDF version 1.4 is 
Acrobat 5 compatible (1 + 4 = 5). PDF version 1.5 is Acrobat 6 compatible, and so on.

8
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
Now in version 9 however, PDF has lost its version number — the reason being, Adobe no longer 
owns the PDF specification. PDF has become an adopted standard by the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO). Since the ISO committee sets the standard, it’s taken out of 
the hands of Adobe and no longer carries a version number.
Each release of Acrobat provides support for additional features in PDF documents. It’s not as 
important to know all the features enabled by one version as it is to know which Acrobat compati-
bility you need to use. For example, to optimize a PDF file for printing, you may need to use PDF 
version 1.3 or Acrobat 4 compatibility. Or, if you want to embed movie files in a PDF, then you 
need to use an Acrobat 6–compatible file. Or, you may want to add password security to a PDF 
that requires a newer Acrobat viewer to open a file using a password.
Whereas you previously may have thought of PDF version files, you now need to think in terms 
of Acrobat version compatibility. The PDF specification is handled by ISO, but the Acrobat 
compatibility is handled by Adobe Systems. ISO 32000 is the ISO specification for the current 
PDF version.
Understanding PDF Standards
PDF has been adopted as a standard file format in many industries, including engineering, legal, 
manufacturing, and prepress and printing. Even the United States Federal Government has 
embraced PDF as a standard file format.
So what are standards? Without regulation and approved standards, the computer industry would 
be chaotic. Fortunately, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) develops and 
approves standards for the technical industry. This international committee, an entity apart from 
Adobe Systems, has approved and developed substandards of the PDF format.
The PDF standards available now include the following:
 PDF/X. This standard is a subset of the PDF format used in the printing industry. PDFs 
meeting PDF/X compliance are typically reliable and, theoretically, can be accurately 
printed on almost any kind of PostScript device.
 PDF/E. This standard is a subset of the PDF format designed for engineers to insure that 
industrial designs and drawings comply with a PDF standard.
 PDF/A. This standard is a subset of the PDF format used for archiving documents. The 
standards committee wants to insure that the files you create today and save as PDF can 
be viewed by computers many years in the future. To do so, the PDFs you create for 
archival purposes can be saved as PDF/A documents.

 PDF/UA. Although, as of this writing, this subset of the PDF format is in an early draft 
stage, you may be hearing more about it in the near future — about one to two years 
from this writing. The goal of this proposed new standard is to provide universal access 
(UA) to all users including those persons working with assistive devices (see Chapter 25 
for more on PDFs and assistive devices). The proposed new format is in the hands of the 
AIIMS Standards Board Committee that also proposed the PDF/X and PDF/A standards 
and submitted them to the ISO. People interested in participating on the committee can 
find more information at www.aiim.org/standards.asp?ID=27861.
Acrobat Environment
Acrobat provides you with features such as menu commands, toolbars, and palettes to accomplish 
work for whatever goal you hope to achieve with PDF documents. When you launch the program 
you see many of these features in the Acrobat window. Just so you know what is being referred to 
when I discuss accessing a feature in Acrobat, take a look at Figure 1.1 to understand the names 
used to describe the various areas of the new Acrobat workplace.
A Title bar. By default, the name of the file you open appears in the title bar. The title 
appearing in the title bar can change according to an option for displaying the Document 
Title in the Initial View properties.

Note that the left side of Figure 1.1 shows a PDF document opened in Form Edit mode 
while the right side of the figure is a PDF file opened in Viewer mode. See item J for more 
on Form Edit mode.
B Menu bar. The menu bar (Viewer mode) contains all the top-level menu commands. 
Many of these menu choices are also available from various actions associated with links 
and form fields when you choose the Execute a menu item command in the Actions 
Properties dialog box for links, form fields, and other features that permit associating an 
action with a command. When viewing files showing toolbars and menus for each open 
document, the Acrobat window appears as shown in Figure 1.1 on the right side of the

Menus
As with any program operating on a computer system that supports a Windows type of environ-
ment, you’ll notice menu commands at the top level of the Acrobat window. Users of previous ver-
sions will notice that Acrobat 9 features a editing mode that contains tools specific to creating PDF 
forms. If at first glance you don’t see an option you used in Acrobat 8, poke around the menus.

The File menu is where you open and close documents, create PDF files, import and export certain 
data, access print commands, and find some other nifty new additions in Acrobat such as the new 
Acrobat 9 PDF Portfolios and collaboration features. The Mac and Windows operating systems dis-

menu along with other familiar commands from Acrobat 8. There are no changes to the Edit menu 
from Acrobat 8.
 FIGURE 1.3
The Edit menu contains the same commands found in Acrobat 7.
View menu
The View menu (see Figure 1.4) contains all the commands you’ll use for viewing PDF documents. 
An addition to the View menu is the Cursor Coordinates command. This command displays a tiny 
window showing the coordinates of the cursor as you move it around the Document pane. The dis-
play units are controlled by opening the Preferences (Ctrl/Ô+K) and changing the Units preferences.
Document menu
The Document menu (see Figure 1.5) contains a collection of commands specific to document 
handling. Options in the Document menu have a few changes in Acrobat 9 compared to the 
options in Acrobat 8. Notice a new command — Split Document. This new command now enables 
you to split PDF files by number of pages, file size, and top-level bookmarks. Although the Paper 
Capture command hasn’t changed submenu commands, the new Clear Scan features in Acrobat 9 
greatly improve scanning and OCR conversion. Notice the Compare Documents command, which 
was formerly in the Advanced menu in earlier Acrobat viewers, has now been moved to the 
Document menu.

Comments menu
There’s not so much change you’ll find in the Comments menu in Acrobat 9, but selecting several 
different commands opens up windows and dialog boxes with some very impressive new features 
in Acrobat 9 (see Figure 1.6). For example, sending files for shared reviews opens a new wizard 
where you can choose to share reviews on Acrobat.com.

Forms menu
Perhaps the biggest change you’ll find in Acrobat 9 is the many new features related to creating 
Acrobat PDF forms (see Figure 1.7). A huge departure from earlier Acrobat features is that all the 
form-editing options that were reserved for Acrobat Pro viewers are now included in Acrobat 
Standard on Windows. In addition, the way you create forms has greatly changed in Acrobat 9. 
Notice the two new menu commands at the top of the menu. Choosing either command opens 
a new user interface called Form Editing Mode where PDF forms are authored. In addition, 
you’ll find a command that enables you to integrate PDF form data with the QuickBooks account-
ing software.

Several changes appear in the Tools menu shown in Figure 1.8. Notice that the Forms command 
that opened the Forms toolbar in Acrobat 8 has been removed in Acrobat 9. There is no Forms 
toolbar in Acrobat 9 since forms editing takes place in Forms Edit mode where you’ll find access to 
all the forms tools. The Measuring toolbar and the Object tool formerly found in the Acrobat 8 
Tools menu have been eliminated and replaced by the Analysis toolbar. In Acrobat 9 you’ll find the 
new Multimedia toolbar accessed by selecting Multimedia in the Tools menu.

Submenus
An extensive number of submenus appear in menus contained in the top-level menu bar and 
from many different tools contained in toolbars. Note that on individual toolbars you see a down-
pointing arrow. Clicking the arrow opens a menu; some menus contain submenus. A submenu is 
denoted in Acrobat by a right-pointing arrow on the right side of a given menu command as 
shown in Figure 1.12. Select a command with one of these arrows adjacent to the command 
name and a submenu opens. In a few cases, you can find nested submenus where another right-
pointing arrow may be visible in a submenu. If you want to access the second submenu, move the 
cursor to the menu option containing a right-pointing arrow. To make a selection from a sub-
menu command, move the cursor to the desired menu command. When the menu command 
highlights, click the mouse button to execute the command.
 FIGURE 1.11
The Help menu gives you access to Help information on selected topics as well as access to the complete 
Acrobat Help document.
Context menus
Wherever you are in the Acrobat window — the toolbars, panels, Document pane, or the various 
editing modes — you can gain quick access to menu items related to your task by opening a con-
text menu. Context menus pop up in an area where you either click the right button on the mouse 
or use an appropriate key modifier. In Windows, right-click the mouse button to open a context 
menu. On a Macintosh, when not using a two-button mouse, press the Control key and click the 
mouse button. Context menu options relate to the particular tool you have selected from a toolbar. 
Selecting different tools provides you with different menu commands. In Figure 1.13 I opened a 
context menu with the Marquee Zoom tool selected.

If you change tools in a toolbar and open a context menu, the menu options change to reflect 
choices with that particular tool. Likewise, a context menu opened on a panel offers menu options 
respective to the panel, as shown in Figure 1.14.

 FIGURE 1.14
When a panel is open in the Navigation pane and you open a context menu, the menu options reflect

TIP
TIP
Opening a context menu on one of the icons in the Navigation pane opens a menu 
where you can add or remove panels from the pane. Additionally, you can hide the 
Navigation panel icons by opening a context menu in the Navigation pane and select Hide 
Navigation Pane Buttons. To bring back the Navigation Pane Buttons, press F4 on your keyboard 
or select View ➪ Navigation Panels ➪ Show Navigation Pane.
Context menus are a great benefit during your Acrobat sessions and using them helps you work 
much faster. Throughout this book I often make references to the different choices you have in 
selecting a tool or command. In most incidences, you find mention of context menus. Be certain 
you know how to open a context menu in Acrobat on your computer. For the remainder of this 
book, I’ll mention opening context menus without walking through the steps for how to open 
the menu.
Keyboard shortcuts
Pressing one or more keys on your keyboard can also open menus and invoke different com-
mands. When you become familiar with keyboard shortcuts that perform the same function as 
when using a menu or context menu, you’ll find yourself favoring this method for making different 
menu selections or grabbing a tool from a toolbar. Fortunately, you can learn as you work when it 
comes to memorizing keyboard shortcuts. As I’m certain you know, several shortcut combinations 
are noted in menu commands. You can learn these shortcuts when you frequently use a particular 
command. However, the keyboard shortcuts you see in the menu commands are just a fraction of 
what is available in Acrobat for quick access to commands and tools. For a complete list of all key-
board shortcuts, look over the Acrobat Help document you open by selecting Help ➪ Adobe 
Acrobat 9.0 (Standard, Pro, or Pro Extended) Help or pressing the F1 key.
NOTE
NOTE
Pressing a single key to access a tool requires you to have your Preferences set to 
accept single keystroke shortcuts. See the steps for “Setting up the Acrobat envi-
ronment” later in this chapter for the proper Preferences settings.

Tools, task buttons, and toolbars
Tools are grouped together in separate toolbars in the Toolbar Well below the menu bar. The 
default view when you launch Acrobat contains several toolbars visible in the Toolbar Well. You 
can remove various toolbars from the Well, move them around the Acrobat window, close them, 
and add different toolbars to the Toolbar Well.
In addition to loading and unloading toolbars, you can also add or remove individual tools from 
any toolbar. Before you learn how to add and remove individual tools, let’s first take a look at the 
Toolbar Well.
The Toolbar Well, where the toolbars are contained, is collapsed and expanded according to the 
number of toolbars you add to it. When a toolbar is contained within the Toolbar Well, it is said to 
be docked. When a toolbar is dragged away from the Toolbar Well and rests atop the Acrobat win-
dow, it is said to be undocked and appears as a floating toolbar.
Task buttons
One of the many different toolbars in Acrobat is called the Tasks toolbar. This toolbar houses vari-
ous Task buttons. In Figure 1.15 the tasks toolbar is shown with the label descriptions to describe 
each tool’s purpose. Task buttons differ a little from other tools in that they all support pull-down 
menus where menu commands related to specific tasks are addressed.
 FIGURE 1.15
The Tasks toolbar contains several Task buttons all containing pull-down menus.
The Tasks toolbar features commands for creating PDFs, combining files, working with reviews 
and online collaboration, securing PDFs, digitally signing PDFs, working with forms, working with 
multimedia, and working with comments.
Loading and unloading tools
The default tools you see in the Toolbar Well when you first open Acrobat are but a mere fraction 
of all the tools available to you. Fortunately in Acrobat, a nifty window is available to help you eas-
ily manage tools.
It’s important to realize that you have toolbars and tools. Tools appear as individual icons con-
tained in a given toolbar. You can choose to show only one tool in a toolbar or all the tools that 
belong to a given toolbar and anything in between. The tools within toolbars can be added and 
deleted from the parent toolbar.

22
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
If you’re familiar with earlier versions of Acrobat and you don’t find tools loaded in the various 
toolbars, your first stop is to open the More Tools menu at the top right corner of your screen. 
Select More Tools from a context menu opened on the Toolbar Well and the More Tools window 
opens as shown in Figure 1.16.
 FIGURE 1.16
Open the More Tools window to show/hide tools in toolbars.
Place a check mark beside any tool to be shown in a toolbar docked in the Toolbar Well or opened 
as a floating toolbar. Figure 1.16 shows you a small portion of available tools that appear in a scrol-
lable window.
NOTE
NOTE
Toolbars themselves can be shown or hidden using the More Tools window. If you 
remove a check mark adjacent to a toolbar name to hide the toolbar, the toolbar 
and all the tools are hidden, even if the individual tools are all checked.
Yet another way to add and remove tools to and from toolbars is to simply open a context menu 
on a toolbar. Right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Macintosh) on a toolbar either docked in 
the Toolbar Well or as a floating toolbar and a pop-up menu provides options for adding or 
removing tools to/from that toolbar group.

In Figure 1.17 a context menu is opened on the Edit toolbar. When Show/Hide Tools is selected a 
submenu displays all toolbars. Select an item unchecked to open the respective toolbar, or select a 
checked toolbar to remove/hide it. Note that hiding a toolbar is temporary and only hides the tool-
bar from view in the Toolbar Well.

If you want all tools within a given toolbar to be shown, select Show All Tools in the 
context menu.
The Show/Hide menu command in the context menu shown in Figure 1.18 provides the same 
commands you have available in the View ➪ Toolbars submenu. Either of these menus provides 
you a quick and easy way to show and hide toolbars.
The last menu item in the context menu shown in Figure 1.18 is used to open the More Tools win-
dow where you can add/remove tools among all toolbars.
Default toolbars
When you launch Acrobat for the first time or you set the toolbars to the default view, six different 
toolbars are docked in the Toolbar Well, including the Tasks toolbar discussed earlier in this sec-
tion. The remaining default toolbars include:

24
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
 File toolbar. These tools are used for general document handling. The default File tools 
activate commands for Open, Save, Print, and Email and Upload. When all the tools are 
loaded in the File toolbar the Create PDF from web page and Attach a File tools are 
added to the toolbar. In Figure 1.19 the File toolbar appears with all the File tools in 
view.
 FIGURE 1.18
The File toolbar contains tools for document handling, such as opening PDF documents, 
saving documents, and printing files.
 Page Navigation toolbar. The default tools in the Page Navigation toolbar shown on the 
left in Figure 1.19 contain tools for moving back and forth between PDF document 
pages. The numbers indicate what page you are currently viewing out of the total number 
of pages in the document. When the toolbar is expanded to show all tools as you see in 
Figure 1.19, the First Page, Previous Page, Next Page, Last Page, Previous View, and Next 
View tools are shown.
 FIGURE 1.19
The Page Navigation toolbar, as the name implies, contains tools for navigating docu-
ment pages.
 Page Display toolbar. The Page Display toolbar is the home of many different tools used 
for page viewing, but only two of the tools appear in the default toolbar. When you first 
open Acrobat, you see the Scrolling Pages and One Full Page tool. After expanding the 
toolbar to show all tools as shown in Figure 1.20, the Single Page Continuous, Single 
Page, Two-Up, Two-Up Continuous, Full Screen Mode, Rotate Counterclockwise, Rotate 
Clockwise, and Line Weights tools are shown.
 FIGURE 1.20
The Page Display toolbar contains many tools used for page viewing.

 Select & Zoom toolbar. The tools in this group are used to select text/images, move the 
page in the Document pane, and zoom in and out of pages in the Document pane. Figure 
1.21 shows the Select tool followed by the Hand tool and then the Dynamic Zoom tool, 
the Zoom Out, Zoom In, Zoom Value tools, Actual Size, Fit Width, Fit Page, Pan & Zoom 
Window, Loupe tool, and Snapshot.
 FIGURE 1.21
Select & Zoom tools are used to select text/images, move a document around the 
Document pane, copy selections, and view the document page using a number of dif-
ferent zoom tools.
 Find toolbar. Of all the default toolbars, the Find toolbar shown in Figure 1.22 is the 
only one that does not have additional tools that can be added to the toolbar. However, a 
pull-down menu exists for making choices to refine your search for words in an open 
PDF document.

Managing default toolbars
In addition to loading and unloading tools within toolbars, the toolbars can be moved, docked, 
and undocked from the Toolbar Well. Here’s a list of some of the things you can do with the 
default toolbars and any other toolbars you decide to view:
 Undocking toolbars. Toolbars can be relocated from within the Toolbar Well to another 
area within the Acrobat window. For example, you might find it more convenient to 
move a toolbar you frequently access during an editing session so it is positioned at the 
right side of the Document pane. If so, just place the cursor on top of the vertical separa-
tor bar adjacent to the first tool in a toolbar and drag it away from the Toolbar Well. This 
vertical line is the hot spot used to select the toolbar instead of a tool in the group. 
Clicking anywhere else in the toolbar selects a tool.

26
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
 Docking toolbars. To dock a toolbar back in the Toolbar Well once removed, drag the 
toolbar, again by the vertical separator bar adjacent to the first tool, on top of the Toolbar 
Well. The toolbar snaps to an available position in the Well. If you drop the toolbar 
between two other toolbars, the toolbar you relocate back to the Toolbar Well snaps in 
position between the two docked toolbars.
 
Toolbars can also be docked vertically on the left and right sides of the Document pane 
and at the bottom of the Acrobat window below the status bar. For example, if you drag a 
toolbar to the left of the Navigation pane and release the mouse button, the toolbar snaps 
to a docking station and the tools display vertically. In Figure 1.23 you can see toolbars 
docked on the left (A), and right (B), with one floating toolbar (C) in the Document pane.
 Resetting toolbars: You can position toolbars around the Acrobat window and return 
them to the default positions with one menu command. This is particularly helpful if 
multiple users work on a single computer or you frequently change editing tasks that 
require using different tools during different editing sessions. In many cases it’s easier to 
reset toolbars to the original default view than open tools needed for a specific editing 
task. To set toolbars to their defaults, open a context menu from any toolbar or in the 
Toolbar Well by right-clicking (Control+clicking on Macintosh), and select the menu 
item Reset Toolbars as shown in Figure 1.24. Alternately, you can press Alt/Option+F8.
 FIGURE 1.23
Toolbars can be docked on all four sides of the Acrobat window and undocked from the 
Toolbar Well where they appear as floating toolbars.

27
Getting to Know Adobe Acrobat

 FIGURE 1.24
To return toolbars back to the default view, open a context menu from any toolbar or in 
the Toolbar Well and select Reset Toolbars.
 Hiding all toolbars. Toolbars can be hidden from view to offer you more room when 
editing a PDF document or browsing the contents of PDFs. To hide the toolbars from 
view, open a context menu from the Toolbar Well and choose Hide Toolbars. When tool-
bars are hidden you won’t have access to a context menu to get the toolbars back in view. 
Instead, choose View ➪ Toolbars ➪ Show Toolbars to make all toolbars reappear. (Note 
that using this menu command also hides toolbars.)
 Hiding a single toolbar. You can hide a toolbar after it has been undocked from the 
Toolbar Well. Click the X in the top right corner of the toolbar (Windows) or the small 
circle on the top left side of the toolbar (Macintosh) to close it, and it disappears from 
view. From a context menu opened on any toolbar or the Toolbar Well, you can open 
the toolbar and display it in the Acrobat window again. Toolbars can also be hidden by 
using the More Tools window, opening a context menu on the Toolbar Well and select-
ing a toolbar with a check mark to hide it, and selecting toolbars in the View ➪ Toolbars 
submenu.
 Locking toolbars. The vertical separator bar used to move toolbars disappears when you 
select Lock Toolbars from a context menu. The toolbars cannot be inadvertently moved 
after you lock them. To unlock the toolbars, open a context menu and select Lock 
Toolbars again. The check mark alongside the menu command becomes unchecked and 
the toolbars are unlocked in the Toolbar Well. If the toolbars are locked and you drag an 
undocked toolbar on top of the Toolbar Well, it won’t dock. You need to first unlock the 
toolbars before you can redock them. Additionally, you need to unlock toolbars in order 
to use the Reset Toolbars command in a Toolbar Well context menu to return tools and 
toolbars back to the default position.

28
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
NOTE
NOTE
You can also lock toolbars that are undocked outside of the Toolbar Well. The sepa-
rator bar on the toolbar disappears on floating toolbars the same as it does for tool-
bars docked in the Toolbar Well. However, locking undocked toolbars does not prevent you 
from moving them around the Acrobat window. You can click and drag the title bar for any 
undocked toolbar and move it to another location.
 Setting new toolbar defaults. If you decide to reposition your toolbars and want to keep 
them fixed as new defaults, Acrobat can do so for you automatically. Move the toolbars to 
the desired locations and go about your work. When you quit Acrobat and reopen the 
program, the toolbar positions remain as you last arranged them. Unfortunately, Acrobat 
does not have a Save Workspace command like you find in several Adobe Creative Suite 
applications.
TIP
TIP
If you are unfamiliar with many Acrobat tools, you can change the tool labels to 
show you a more descriptive label for each tool that offers you a hint of what the 
tool does. To show more descriptive labels, open a context menu on the Acrobat Toolbar Well 
and choose Show Button Labels ➪ All Labels. The toolbars expand and show a text description 
for each tool’s name. Keep this option active until you are familiar with the tool names.
Understanding advanced toolbars
The default toolbars represent a fraction of the tools available to you in Acrobat. Many of the other 
toolbars remain hidden from view. The reason for this is obvious when you load all the toolbars in 
the Toolbar Well. You lose a lot of viewing real estate when all toolbars are docked in the Toolbar 
Well. Unless you have a large display monitor or a second monitor, working on a file in the 
Document pane when all toolbars are in view gives little room to see document pages. Fortunately, 
by managing the toolbars you can elect to show only the tools you want to work with and you can 
move them around the Acrobat window, allowing for the best view.
You open toolbars from menu commands in the Tools menu or by opening a context menu on the 
Toolbar Well. If you’re a seasoned Acrobat user, your first encounter with Acrobat viewers 6 and 
above might be a bit frustrating if you don’t know how to access the tools you want to use. “Where 
is that Form tool?” you may ask. Don’t worry; it’s there. You just have to poke around and search 
for it or, better yet, look over the following descriptions to understand more about how these other 
tools are grouped into separate toolbars.
Opening advanced toolbars
For the purpose of discussion, I’ll refer to the non-default toolbars as advanced toolbars. Acrobat 
does not refer to all these tools as advanced tools. Some of the tools labeled in the menu com-
mands are not referred to as advanced tools. For clarity in this chapter, though, consider all the 
following toolbars as advanced toolbars.
You can use three methods for displaying toolbars not visible when you open Acrobat. You can 
open the View ➪ Toolbars menu where you find a list of tools in submenus. Select a submenu item 
to open a toolbar as a floating toolbar in the Acrobat window. Another method is to open a context 
menu on the Toolbar Well and open toolbars from commands in the menu. A third option, and 
one that provides more options for viewing all tools and toolbars in a single window, is to use the

More Tools menu command when you open a context menu on the Toolbar Well. As a matter of 
routine, you should use this option when preparing an Acrobat session that requires you to use 
several tools and toolbars. All tools except the Form tools Pro are accessible from the context 
menu.
Analysis toolbar
In Acrobat 8 you had the Measuring toolbar and the Object Data tool opening in two separate tool-
bars. These two toolbars have been added to a new toolbar in Acrobat 9 shown in Figure 1.25. In 
addition to these tools you find the Geospatial Location tool and the Geospatial Registration tool 
(Acrobat Professional Extended only) that enable you to view geospatial data on maps.
 FIGURE 1.25
The Analysis toolbar combines the Measuring tools and the Object Data tool with the new Geospatial 
tools added in Acrobat Professional Extended.
Advanced Editing toolbar
The Advanced Editing toolbar shown in Figure 1.26 is one you’ll use in just about all Acrobat edit-
ing sessions. Tools include the Select Object tool that is used to select content you add in Acrobat 
such as comment markups and form fields. The Article tool is used to create article threads; the 
Crop and Link tools follow. The TouchUp Text tool is used to edit text on a page, the TouchUp 
Reading Order is used with accessibility editing, and the last tool is the TouchUp Object tool that 
is used to select objects such as vector objects and images.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
You’ll notice that the Advanced Editing toolbar does not contain the Movie tool and 
the Sound tool. These tools have been moved to the new Multimedia toolbar in

Properties Bar
You use the Properties Bar (see Figure 1.33) in conjunction with several different tools. After you 
create comments, links, buttons, and similar content in a PDF document, the selected comment, 
link, button, and so on displays current properties such as colors, fonts, and line weights in the 
Properties Bar. You can make changes in the Properties Bar without visiting the Properties dialog 
box. You can quickly open the Properties Bar with a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl/Ô+E) or via a context 
menu opened on the Toolbar Well.
 FIGURE 1.33
The Properties Bar offers a quick solution for editing item properties without the need for opening dialog 
boxes.
What happened to the Forms tools?
Don’t be alarmed when you first open Acrobat 9 and look for the Forms toolbar. The form tools 
are all available to you but they don’t appear in the current viewer mode when you open a PDF 
document. You need to change modes to the new Acrobat 9 Form Editing Mode.
NEW FEATURE

Choose Forms ➪ Start Form Wizard or Add or Edit Fields and you’ll change the inter-
face mode to Form Editing Mode. Instead of a toolbar housing the Form tools, you’ll 
find all the same form tools available to you under the Add New Field pull-down menu as shown 
in Figure 1.34.

Form Editing Mode does have a toolbar; however, the Form Editing Mode toolbar is not one that 
you can undock from the area reserved for toolbars. Toolbars are fixed to a location similar to the 
Acrobat Toolbar Well in Form Editing Mode appearing at the top of the window. If you want the 
individual tools to appear without having to open the Add New Field menu, open the menu and 
choose Show Tools on Toolbar. The individual form tools are displayed on the Form Edit toolbar 
as shown in Figure 1.35.

Customizing the Acrobat workplace
Whether you’re an Acrobat pro or a new Acrobat user, seeing all those toolbars loaded and scat-
tered across the Toolbar Well for the first time can be very intimidating. As you poke around and 
possibly feel a little frustration when trying to identify the right tool icon to select the right tool for 
the task at hand, please realize that Acrobat is a multifaceted program serving a huge array of needs 
for different users. Not all the tools and features are designed for use in a single Acrobat session. 
You may be a PDF forms author with a need only for Basic tools, Navigation tools, Edit tools, and 
who switches over to Form Editing Mode. In another session you may be a reviewer and only have 
need for the Comment and Markup tools. You might be an eBook author and need to work with 
many features for creating and viewing eBooks, or you might want to edit PDF pages and post 
modified PDFs on your Web site.
When learning all the tools and commands contained in Acrobat, be certain to look over all the 
chapters where tools are discussed. Learn how to access toolbars and organize them in the Toolbar 
Well. When you begin a new Acrobat session, set up your environment so you can easily select a 
tool from toolbars you dock in the Toolbar Well.

34
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
As a starting point, you can configure Acrobat to provide you with immediate feedback related to 
tools selection and keyboard shortcuts. As you first start using Acrobat, follow the steps in the next 
section to help you customize your environment for more efficient editing and less frustration. In 
this example, an environment for engaging in a commenting session is used. You can change the 
toolbars to meet needs in PDF editing or PDF creation, or add tools for some other kind of work 
you do.
STEPS: Setting up the Acrobat environment
 
1. Return to toolbar defaults. Open Acrobat. Position the cursor on any area in the 
Toolbar Well and right-click to open a context menu (Control+click for Macintosh) and 
select Reset Toolbars.
 
2. Open the More Tools window. From a context menu opened from the Toolbar Well, 
select More Tools to open the More Tools window.
 
3. Add the tools you intend to use to the Comment & Markup toolbar. This is a per-
sonal choice. Look over all the Comment & Markup tools and check just those tools you 
intend to use. Be certain to check the box for the Comment & Markup toolbar so the 
toolbar shows up when you leave the More Tools window. (See Figure 1.36.)
 FIGURE 1.36
The More Tools window

4. Add some Edit tools. While still in the More Tools window, scroll to the Advanced 
Editing toolbar. One tool you’ll use frequently in almost all editing sessions is the Select 
Object tool (denoted with an arrowhead icon). Click the check box for this tool. Other 
tools won’t be used under most circumstances such as the Article tool, Link tool, and so 
on. Uncheck all the tools you anticipate not using.
 
5. Add the Spell Check tool. Scroll to the Edit toolbar and check the Edit toolbar.
 
6. Exit the More Tools window. When certain about the tools you think you’ll use in a 
given editing session, click OK and all the toolbars open as floating toolbars.
 
7. Open the Properties Bar. Again open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and select 
Properties Bar from the menu options. Note that this tool is not available in the More 
Tools window and needs to be opened from a context menu or the View ➪ Toolbars 
submenu.
 
8. Dock the toolbars. After opening all the toolbars you want to use for a given editing ses-
sion return to the Toolbar Well context menu and select Dock Toolbars. This command 
moves all the toolbars to the Toolbar Well, as shown in Figure 1.37.
 FIGURE 1.37
Toolbars docked in the Toolbar Well include the A) File toolbar, B) Select & Zoom tool-
bar, C) Advanced Editing toolbar, D) Edit toolbar, E) Comment & Markup toolbar, and F) 
the Properties Bar.

Tooltips
When you select All Labels from a context menu or preference setting, you see tool descriptions on 
many tools. However, not all tools describe the tool with a label. For example, look at the Zoom In 
tool (the plus symbol). It should be apparent to you what the tool does by viewing the icon in the 
toolbar. Other tools’ functions, however, may not be so apparent from viewing the tool icons. 
Fortunately, you have some extra help in the form of tooltips. To view a tooltip, place the cursor 
over a tool in the Toolbar Well or on a floating toolbar, and pause a moment before selecting the 
tool. A tooltip appears inside a yellow box directly below the cursor with a label describing the 
tool. In Figure 1.38 you can see the tooltip that appears when the cursor is placed over the Sticky 
Note tool. As you move the cursor over different tools, the tooltips change to reflect the description 
of the targeted tool.

36
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
 FIGURE 1.38
Place the cursor over a tool and pause a moment before selecting the tool. A tooltip describing the tool 
opens below the mouse cursor.
As you become familiar with the tools, you can return to the context menu opened from the 
Toolbar Well and choose Button Labels ➪ No Labels. When No Labels is active, your toolbars 
shrink and offer you more room in the Toolbar Well.
Panels
Other tools available to you in all Acrobat viewers are panels. Panels are similar to toolbars in that 
they can be docked to a docking station called the Navigation pane; they can be undocked and 
floated around the Acrobat window; they can contain pull-down menus for selecting more options; 
a series of default panels appears docked in the Navigation pane; and you can open additional pan-
els from menu commands.
A couple distinctions between toolbars and panels are that panels can be placeholders for informa-
tion, and tools can appear inside a panel. Whereas tools are used in the Document pane, many 
panel operations take place directly in the panel. Toolbars remain relatively fixed in size, but pan-
els can be sized and stretched along the Acrobat window to provide you with more room to work 
within the panel or view the information contained within the panel. In addition, some panels con-
tain their own tools where edits can be made in the panel and dynamically reflected on the docu-
ment page. Panels help you organize content, view specific content across many pages, and 
provide some tools for global editing of PDF files.
Default panels
As with toolbars, Acrobat displays a series of panels docked in a well when you first launch the 
program. Panels are contained in the Navigation pane along the left side of the Acrobat window. 
By default, the Navigation pane is collapsed; however, you can save PDF documents in such a 
manner where a panel expands when a file is opened in any Acrobat viewer. These settings are 
document-specific and can be toggled on or off for individual PDF documents.
CROSS-REF

For more information about setting opening views for panel displays, see Chapter 4.
Pages
 
 Acrobat users have been familiar with the thumbnail view of each page since the early days of 
Acrobat. A mini view of each page in the active PDF document is displayed in the Pages pane, as 
shown in Figure 1.39. The Pages pane offers you menu options for arranging, deleting, inserting, 
and editing pages in a number of ways. You can zoom in to the thumbnail views as large as or even 
larger than a page viewed in the Document pane.

For a complete description of working with pages (thumbnails), see Chapter 16.
Bookmarks
 
 The second default panel in the Navigation pane is the Bookmark panel. You can save PDF docu-
ments in a manner where the bookmarks are visible when the file opens in Acrobat. Bookmarks are 
visible in an open Navigation pane, as shown in Figure 1.40. You can open and close the 
Navigation pane by pressing F4. You can also grab the vertical separator bar at the right edge of the 
Navigation pane and move it left and right to size the pane.
Bookmarks are navigation buttons that can launch a page, a view, or one of many different Action 
types similar to link and button actions. Anyone familiar with Acrobat already knows much about 
bookmarks and how to navigate pages by clicking individual bookmarks in the panel.

Signatures
 
 Digital signatures help you manage signed documents; the Signatures panel enables you to perform 
tasks such as displaying signatures in the Signature pane, verifying signatures, clearing them, 
deleting them, and so on. All these editing tasks with signatures are still available in Acrobat 
Professional and Acrobat Standard as is signature validation, which is also available in all Acrobat 
viewers.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For a complete description of creating and managing digital signatures, see 
Chapter 26.
Attachments
 
 The Attachments pane (see Figure 1.41) in all Acrobat viewers is used to display, manage, and 
extract file attachments. You can attach files in Acrobat and extract file attachments using all 
Acrobat viewers including Adobe Reader.
 FIGURE 1.41
The Attachments panel provides options for managing file attachments. Attachments can be extracted from 
within Adobe Reader.

Comments
 
 The Comments panel shows you comments in an expanded horizontal view, just like the 
Attachments panel. When you click the Comments panel, you’ll notice a number of pull-down 
menus (signified by down-pointing arrows at the top of the pane), a list of comments that can be 
expanded and collapsed, and a host of tools within the panel, as shown in Figure 1.42.

Hidden panels
As with toolbars, you can choose to view additional panels through menu commands. You can 
choose to display a number of other panels in the Acrobat window and dock them in the 
Navigation pane. To open a hidden panel, choose View ➪ Navigation Panels. From the submenu, 
you’ll find all the panels available. In Figure 1.43, the list shows Navigation panels available in 
Acrobat Pro Extended.
Another way to access the Navigation panels is through a context menu. Right-click (Windows) or 
Control+click (Macintosh) on the Navigation pane and a menu shows all the Navigation panels. In 
order to see the panels, you must first open them from the Navigation Panels submenu and dock 
them in the Navigation pane. Opening a context menu offers an additional menu command for 
Show/Hide Navigation Panel Buttons as shown in Figure 1.44.
The list includes the default panels. If you select a default panel, the Navigation pane opens and 
the panel is selected. When you select a hidden panel — in other words, a panel other than those 
docked in the Navigation pane when you first launch Acrobat — the panel opens in the Acrobat 
window as a floating panel with one or more panels contained in the window. Drag a panel to the 
Navigation pane and it docks and then becomes visible in a context menu opened from the 
Navigation pane.

ing panel as shown in Figure 1.45. Content features help you reflow tagged PDF files and manipu-
late the structure of tagged documents.

Order
 
 You use the Order panel to manage reading order of documents. This panel also relates to docu-
ment accessibility, like the options available in the Tags panel. The Order panel enables you to add 
tags to a document, clear tags, and reorder a page’s contents to change a reading order that might 
be read aloud by a screen reader.

PDF documents, use the Tags panel. Together with the Content panel options, you have much 
control over document accessibility.

Panel menus
Each of the panels contains its own pull-down menu. When a panel is open in the Navigation pane 
or in a floating window, select the Options down-pointing arrow to open a pull-down menu, as 
shown in Figure 1.48. Menu commands found in panels may or may not be available from the

top-level menu bar. Additionally, some panels, like the Attachments and Comments panels, offer 
you several pull-down menus.
 FIGURE 1.48
Panel Options menus provide menu commands specific to each panel function.
Context menus
Context menus can display different options for panel choices depending on where you open a 
context menu. If you move the cursor to an empty area when all text and objects in a panel are 
deselected and open a context menu, the menu options may be different than when you select text 
or an object in a panel. However, this is not always the case, because a few panels provide you with 
the same options regardless of whether something is selected or not. In Figure 1.49 a context menu 
is opened within the Bookmarks panel. In this case you need to open the menu on a bookmark 
name. If you attempt to open a context menu in an empty area in the pane, no menu opens.

Understanding Preferences
Preferences enable you to customize your work sessions in Acrobat. You can access a Preferences 
dialog box from within any Acrobat viewer and from within a Web browser when viewing PDFs as 
inline views. A huge number of preferences exist that all relate to specific tool groups or task cate-
gories, and it would not make as much sense to cover them here in the opening chapter as it 
would within chapters related to using tools and methods influenced by preference choices.
Some general things you should know about preferences is that they are contained in a dialog box 
as shown in Figure 1.50. You make a topic selection in the list on the left side of the dialog box 
and the related preferences are shown to the right side of the list. You make choices for preferences 
by selecting check boxes or making menu selections from pull-down menus. When you complete 
making your preference choices, click OK at the bottom of the dialog box.
Almost all the preferences you change in the Preferences dialog box are dynamic, which means you 
don’t need to quit Acrobat and relaunch the program for a preference choice to take effect. 
Preferences remain in effect until you change them again. If you quit Acrobat and relaunch the 
program, the preferences you last made are honored by Acrobat. However, if for some reason the 
program crashes and you don’t shut it down properly, any new preference changes will not be rec-
ognized when the program is launched again.
 FIGURE 1.50
Press Ctrl/Ô+K to open the Preferences dialog box. Click a category on the left and the choices are 
reflected to the left of the categories list.

Welcome to Adobe Acrobat

If you find some operation in Acrobat not working as you think it should, first take a look at the 
Preferences dialog box. In many cases you’ll find a check box or menu command not enabled to 
permit you to perform a task. As you become familiar with specific tool groups and menu com-
mands, make a habit of routinely visiting the Preferences dialog box so you understand all the tog-
gles and switches that affect tool and viewing behavior.
Summary
This chapter offers you a general introduction for working in Acrobat Standard Acrobat Pro and 
Acrobat Pro Extended and helps you understand the environment, the user interface, and some of 
the many new features added to the commercial Acrobat products. At the very least, you should 
know how to go about finding help when you first start working in the program. Some of the more 
important points discussed in this chapter include the following:
 Adobe Acrobat is a multifaceted program designed to provide solutions for many differ-
ent business professionals. Several types of Acrobat viewers exist, ranging in features to 
suit different user needs. The most sophisticated of the three viewers is Acrobat Pro 
Extended (Windows), now in version 9. Acrobat Standard (Windows only) offers fewer 
tools and menu commands than Acrobat Pro (Windows and Macintosh).
 PDF, short for Portable Document Format, was developed by Adobe Systems and was 
designed to exchange documents between computers and across computer platforms 
while maintaining file integrity.
 The PDF language format has changed version numbers along with the Acrobat viewers. 
Beginning in Acrobat 9, the PDF specification is no longer owned by Adobe. The 
International Organization for Standards now regulates the PDF specification.
 Tasks are performed through the use of menus, tools, and panels that can be accessed 
through mouse selections and keyboard shortcuts.
 The extensive list of tools appears in an abbreviated form when you open Acrobat and 
view the default toolbars. You can open additional toolbars from menu commands or the 
new More Tools window. You can dock toolbars in the Toolbar Well or float them 
around the Acrobat window.
 Panels are similar to toolbars in that they can be docked and undocked from a well called 
the Navigation pane. Panels contain pull-down menus, and some panels contain tools.
 You can customize the Acrobat workplace to suit your work style through the use of dif-
ferent preference choices. When preferences, panels, and toolbars are changed from their 
default views, the new views are saved when you quit your Acrobat session. They remain 
unchanged until you change them again or reset them to defaults.
 Preferences are settings that apply globally to Acrobat and influence the behavior of tools 
and menu commands.

47
I
n Chapter 1 you got a feel for some of the tools and menu commands 
provided in Acrobat Standard and Acrobat Pro, and Acrobat Pro 
Extended. If you’re a PDF author and you use Acrobat Standard or Pro, 
or Pro Extended, knowing the capabilities of one viewer versus another is 
important for both job efficiency and productivity, as well as usefulness to 
the end user. You may want to add multimedia to a PDF document. 
Therefore, you need to know what authoring tool is needed to import video 
and sound. You may be sending out a document for review and want to 
solicit comments. Therefore, you need to know what viewer a user needs to 
send comments back to you.
At times you may find that none of the Acrobat products can help you do 
some editing tasks needed in your workflow. Fortunately, you have options 
for acquiring Acrobat plug-ins developed by third-party manufacturers that 
add much more functionality to the Acrobat tools and menu commands.
Many of the chapters ahead give you an idea of the distinctions between 
Acrobat Standard and Acrobat Pro, and Acrobat Pro Extended and the tools 
accessible from one viewer versus the other. This chapter introduces you to 
the Acrobat viewers, points out some differences among them, and shows 
you how to use Acrobat plug-ins when you need more features than the 
viewers provide.
Viewer Distinctions
Adobe Reader, Acrobat Standard (Windows only in version 8 and 9), 
Acrobat Pro, and Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows only) are designed to 
serve different users with different purposes. It should be obvious to you that

Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
Adobe Reader, as a free download from Adobe’s Web site, is much more limited in features and 
performance than the products you purchase. 
For a general overview, take a look at the following descriptions of the Acrobat products.
Adobe Reader
Adobe Reader is available for download from Adobe’s Web site free of charge. The Adobe Reader 
software is distributed for the purpose of viewing, printing, and searching, on PDF files created by 
users of Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro, or Acrobat Pro Extended. Additionally, Adobe Reader is 
used for filling in forms on PDFs created with Acrobat Standard (new in Acrobat 9), Acrobat Pro, 
and Acrobat Pro Extended. The major features of Adobe Reader include:
 Viewing and printing. These features are common across all Acrobat viewers. You can 
view, navigate, and print PDF documents with Adobe Reader.
 Forms completion and submission. Adobe Reader enables you to complete forms but 
not save the form field data unless the forms carry special usage rights for Adobe Reader 
users. Forms are submitted through the use of buttons created on forms for emailing or 
submitting data to Web servers.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on enabling PDFs with usage rights, see Chapter 19.
 Comment and Review. PDFs can be enabled with usage rights for commenting and 
review in Acrobat Pro, and Acrobat Pro Extended. Once enabled, Reader users can partic-
ipate in a review workflow and save PDFs locally with comments and markups.
 Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES. If an organization uses the Adobe LiveCycle 
Reader Extensions ES product available from Adobe Systems to enhance PDF files, Adobe 
Reader users can digitally sign documents and save form data.
 
A distinction exists between enabling PDFs with usage rights from within Acrobat 
Standard, Acrobat Pro, and Acrobat Pro Extended and using the Adobe LiveCycle Reader 
Extensions ES. Licensing restrictions do apply when enabling documents and you should 
be aware of these restrictions. See Chapter 19 for all you need to know about enabling 
PDFs and licensing restrictions.
In addition to the preceding, Adobe Reader provides support for eBook services and searching PDF 
documents, as well as extended support for working with accessible documents.

What happened to Acrobat Elements? In a word, it’s gone. You won’t find the low cost PDF cre-
ation tool shipped with Acrobat 9.

Acrobat Standard versus Acrobat Pro Products
Acrobat Standard is available only on Windows in version 8 and 9 of Acrobat. The Macintosh ver-
sion was discontinued when Acrobat 8 was released. Adobe Systems is a company that tries hard 
to respond to user needs, but there are limitations. If a product does not support the development 
costs, then it is likely to be discontinued. This is the case with Acrobat Standard on the Macintosh. 
Many users of Acrobat on the Mac acquire Acrobat Pro in a bundled purchase with the Adobe 
Creative Suite. Independent sales of Acrobat Standard were minimal on the Mac during the 
Acrobat 7 life cycle. Therefore, Adobe could not justify the development costs for continuing the 
product. On Windows, sales of Acrobat Standard were much greater, and therefore you see 
Acrobat Standard still available.
Acrobat Standard is the lightweight of the authoring programs. However, Acrobat Standard still offers 
many tools for PDF creation and authoring. Without going into every tool that differs between 
Acrobat Standard and Acrobat Pro, the major differences include the following limitations:
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
Acrobat 9 Standard now supports creating Acrobat PDF forms. 
 Form field authoring. The Forms toolbar has been added to Acrobat Standard. This is a 
major upgrade for Acrobat Standard users. You can create PDF forms with field objects, 
add JavaScripts, distribute forms, and collect form data. Acrobat Standard also supports 
enabling forms for Adobe Reader users.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on writing JavaScripts, see Chapter 36 (on the CD-ROM).
 Professional printing. Acrobat Standard does not provide options for soft proofing 
color, pre-flighting jobs, or commercial printing using such features as color separations, 
frequency control, transparency flattening, and so on. All these print controls are con-
tained only in Acrobat Pro.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on preflighting, soft proofing color, and commercial printing, see 
Chapter 32.
 Adding Adobe Reader usage rights. You can add usage rights that enable Adobe Reader 
users to extract file attachments from PDF documents, and in Acrobat 9 Standard, add 
usage rights for Reader users to save form field data and add digital signatures.

index files only with the Acrobat Pro products through a menu command that launches 
Acrobat Catalog.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on creating index files, see Chapter 6.
 Creating PDFs. Acrobat Standard offers support for an impressive range of file types that 
can be converted to PDF. However, Acrobat Standard doesn’t support creating PDFs from 
certain file types such as AutoCAD, Microsoft Visio, and Microsoft Project. Acrobat 
Standard does use Acrobat Distiller, but the Acrobat Standard Distiller does not support 
PDF/X, PDF/E, and PDF/A compliance. Additionally, Acrobat Standard does not support 
Adobe Presenter features.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on using Acrobat Distiller, see Chapter 10. For information on 
PDF/A and PDF/X, see Chapters 10 and 32.
 Engineering tools. Acrobat Standard does not support some features used by engineers 
and technical illustrators, such as merging and flattening layers.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on using the measuring tools and working with layers, see 
Chapter 24.
The preceding items are some of the major differences between Acrobat Standard and the Acrobat 
Pro viewers. You will discover subtle differences as you work with the programs. For example, 
Acrobat Standard doesn’t support comparing documents, migrating comments, Bates numbering, 
show and snap to grids, converting .dwg and .indd files, does not contain the PDF Optimizer for 
repurposing files, and so on.
If your mission is to recommend the product for purchase or make the decision for your own use, 
be aware of the three primary distinctions between the products: Acrobat Standard does not sup-
port professional printing, engineering tools, or adding Adobe Reader usage rights for review and 
comment and forms data saving and digital signatures. If your work is in one of these areas, you 
need to purchase Acrobat Pro.
Acrobat Pro Extended
Acrobat Pro Extended is a commercial Acrobat product with all the features of Acrobat Pro plus 
several other features making it the high end Acrobat performance tool. Acrobat Pro Extended has 
all the features previously found in the former Acrobat 3D product as well as more robust features 
for both technical people and knowledge workers. Included with Acrobat Pro Extended you find

learn more about Acrobat Pro Extended, take a look at the Acrobat Pro Extended Corner on the 
Adobe Acrobat User Community Web site at www.acrobatusers.com/go/3D.
Acrobat Pro versus Acrobat Pro Extended
Acrobat Pro Extended takes advantage of some impressive new features Adobe made available in 
Acrobat 9. In addition to all the 3D features available in Acrobat Pro Extended that aren’t available 
in Acrobat Pro, you also find some nonrelated 3D features that have been added to Acrobat Pro 
Extended in version 9 that include:

Adobe’s Acrobat Product Line Strategy
In case you’re confused about where the new Acrobat Pro Extended product fits in Adobe’s 
Acrobat product lineup, let’s take a quick look at the marketing strategy for the Acrobat products. 
In earlier versions of Acrobat you found Acrobat 3D, which was a product marketed to a vertical 
market audience of engineers and manufacturing professionals. Acrobat 3D contained all the fea-
tures of Acrobat Pro with the addition of the 3D features that were primarily used by engineers. 
Adobe marketing was focused on delivering this product to engineering and manufacturing 
professionals.
In version 9 of Acrobat we have Adobe Acrobat Pro Extended, and we find the inclusion of new 
features such as video to flash conversion and support for Adobe Presenter, which aren’t features 
related specifically to engineers. Therefore, you may be wondering why these types of features are 
added to a product that’s targeted at the engineering market.
In short, Adobe is positioning Acrobat ProExtended to a horizontal audience. The 3D features 
remain in Acrobat Pro Extended with the expansion of additional features that will appeal to PDF 
authors in many other disciplines. Think of Acrobat Pro Extended much as you would view Adobe 
Photoshop Extended in the Photoshop line of products.
What Acrobat product you choose depends on your PDF creation needs and your budget. Acrobat 
Standard is the low-cost PDF authoring application on Windows only that now includes forms 
authoring and enabling features for Adobe Reader users. It doesn’t have many vertical applications 

53
Using Acrobat Viewers

features for industries such as printing, law, and engineering but might be just the ticket for gen-
eral business office workers, which is the market Adobe hopes to capture with this product.
Acrobat Pro is the midpoint for PDF authors. You find all the features of Acrobat Standard plus 
some vertical applications for the print industry and law. Unless you have a need for engineering 
tools such as CAD and map conversions but want more features than Acrobat Standard, this prod-
uct might be your best option.
Acrobat Pro Extended is the high-end performer that includes all features of Acrobat Pro plus all 
the vertical applications including engineering. Additionally, it also includes some impressive new 
features for rich media including transcoding video files to Adobe Flash format, the addition of 
Adobe Presenter, and a wonderful set of tools designed for cartographers. If the high end is your 
desire, then Acrobat Pro Extended is your product.
Using Plug-ins
All Acrobat viewers support a plug-in architecture. Plug-ins are installed during your Acrobat 
installation and loaded when you launch Acrobat. Many of the features you find when exercising 
commands and using tools are made possible by the use of plug-ins. To view the current plug-ins 
loaded with the viewer you use, choose Help ➪ About Adobe Plug-ins. The About Adobe Plug-Ins 
dialog box opens as shown in Figure 2.1.
 FIGURE 2.1
The About Adobe Plug-Ins dialog box lists all the plug-ins accessible to your viewer.

54
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
The list in the left side of the dialog box lists the names of the installed plug-ins. Click a name to 
see a description for the plug-in, including whether the plug-in is certified, the version number, 
creation date, text description, and dependencies. To examine different plug-ins, select them in the 
left pane and view the description on the right side of the dialog box.
Acrobat plug-ins are created by Adobe Systems and third-party developers. All plug-ins from 
Adobe Systems are certified plug-ins. No third-party plug-ins are certified. Some features in Acrobat 
require that only certified plug-ins be loaded before the feature is enabled. Working with eBooks is 
one example where only certified plug-ins can be used. 
NOTE
NOTE
Any time a document has Adobe DRM (Digital Rights Management) protection such as 
eBooks and/or documents protected with the Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management ES 
Server, the viewer is launched in certified plug-in mode. This mode loads only Adobe plug-ins and 
disables all third-party plug-ins.
In order to instruct your Acrobat viewer to open with only certified plug-ins, open the Preferences 
dialog box by choosing Edit ➪ Preferences. Click General in the left pane and select the Use only 
certified plug-ins check box, as shown in Figure 2.2. When you quit your Acrobat viewer and 
relaunch the program, only certified plug-ins will load.
 FIGURE 2.2
Select Use only certified plug-ins to allow only certified plug-ins to load upon opening.

55
Using Acrobat Viewers

Plug-ins developed by third-party developers can also be loaded. The list of available resources for 
adding to Acrobat functionality in the form of add-ons and plug-ins is almost limitless. As you 
review all the chapters in this book and find that something you want to accomplish in your work-
flow is not covered, look for a plug-in developed by a third-party developer. Chances are that you 
can find a product well suited to do the job.
Plug-ins for Acrobat are far too numerous to mention in this book. For a single source where 
you can view a list of plug-ins, download demonstration copies, and make purchases, visit 
Acrobat Plug-ins World (http://acrobat.pluginsworld.com), the Planet PDF store at 
www.pdfstore.com, the Adobe Store at www.adobe.com and click on the Store link, or The 
PowerXChange at www.thepowerxchange.com. On several Web sites you’ll find product 
descriptions and workflow solutions for almost any third-party product designed to work with 
Acrobat. When you visit one of the Web sites and review the products, be certain the product 
you purchase is upgraded to work with Acrobat 9.0 and the viewer you use. All products are 
listed with links to the manufacturer’s Web sites, so you can find information on product 
descriptions, version numbers, and compatibility issues.
Installing plug-ins
Most plug-ins you acquire from third-party developers are accompanied by an installer program. 
Installing plug-ins is easy. Open the folder for a plug-in you download from a Web site and 
double-click the installer icon. The installer routine finds the plug-ins folder inside your Acrobat 
folder and the plug-in is loaded when you launch Acrobat.
If a plug-in is not accompanied by an installer program, you need to manually add the plug-in to 
your Acrobat plug-ins folder. On Windows, open the Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 9.0\Acrobat\
plug_ins folder. Copy the plug-in you want to install to this folder.
On the Macintosh, open your Applications folder. Open the Acrobat 9 Pro folder from within the 
Applications folder. Press and hold the Control key and click the program icon (Adobe Acrobat 9 
Pro) to open a context menu, as shown in Figure 2.3. From the menu items, click Show Package 
Contents.
When you open the Package Contents, the Contents folder appears in a single window. Double-
click the folder to open it. Several folders appear within the Contents folder, one of which is 
named Plug-ins. Open this folder and copy your plug-in to it.

56
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
 FIGURE 2.3
Open the Package Contents on the Macintosh to gain access to the Plug-ins folder.
Uninstalling plug-ins
If your plug-in is not accompanied by an uninstaller program, you need to either disable the plug-
in or physically remove it from the Acrobat plug-ins folder. A temporary solution is to disable 
third-party plug-ins by opening the Preferences dialog box, clicking on Startup, and selecting the 
check box for Use only certified plug-ins, as shown earlier in Figure 2.2.
To permanently remove a plug-in, open the plug-ins folder as described in the previous section, 
“Installing plug-ins,” and drag the plug-in out of the Acrobat plug-ins folder.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Some plug-ins are installed in their own folder. To remove a plug-in, drag the folder 
where the plug-in is installed out of the Acrobat plug-ins folder. Be certain not to 
remove the Acrobat plug-ins folder from within the Acrobat folder. Doing so disables all tools 
and menu commands using plug-ins.
Resolving plug-in conflicts
At times you may find a plug-in conflict among several third-party products or a plug-in that may 
have a bug. If your Acrobat functionality is impaired and you can’t launch the program, hold down 
the Shift key while double-clicking the program icon to launch your viewer. All plug-ins are dis-
abled when you use the modifier key. Open the Preferences dialog box again and select the Use 
only certified plug-ins check box. Quit and relaunch the program, and the offending plug-in is 
eliminated during startup.

57
Using Acrobat Viewers
2
If a plug-in is creating a problem, you may need to use a process of elimination to figure out which 
one it is by opening your plug-ins folder and removing all plug-ins. Then add several plug-ins at a 
time back to the plug-ins folder and launch your viewer. Keep adding plug-ins back into the plug-
ins folder until you discover the plug-in that produces the error.
Working with plug-ins
There are many different plug-ins that provide you more features when working with Adobe 
Acrobat and Adobe Reader than can be covered in this book. To pick one out among the many is a 
hard choice. For your own workflow, visit the Planet PDF Store, Adobe Store, Acrobat plug-ins 
World, the PowerXChange, or the Acrobat User Community and explore various plug-ins available 
for download. Try to find a plug-in that offers at least a demo trial period and download it.
Almost all plug-ins come with a ReadMe file or user manual. Before installing a plug-in, be certain 
to review the installation recommendations by the developer. Install the plug-in and give it a try.
Summary
 The four Acrobat viewers include Adobe Reader, Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro, and 
Acrobat Pro Extended. All of these applications can create Adobe PDFs (with the excep-
tion of Adobe Reader).
 Adobe Reader is a free download from Adobe’s Web site. All other products require 
purchase.
 Acrobat Standard offers fewer features than Acrobat Pro and is available in version 8 and 
9 on Windows only. The primary limitations with Acrobat Standard are no commercial 
printing and engineering tools. These features are only available in Acrobat Pro and 
Acrobat Pro Extended.
 Acrobat ProExtended includes the functionality of Acrobat 3D version 8 that has been 
rebranded in version 9 and adds support for PDF Portfolio Templates and converting 
media files to the FLV (Flash Video) format, in addition to all the 3D features that were 
available in Acrobat 8.
 Acrobat plug-ins are additions to Acrobat that offer features and tools for adding more 
functionality to Acrobat viewers. Plug-ins are installed with Acrobat from sources devel-
oped by Adobe Systems.
 Plug-ins are available from third-party software manufacturers. A complete list of plug-ins 
and demonstration products is available at the Planet PDF Store, the Adobe Store, 
Acrobat Plug-ins World, and The PowerXChange.

I
n Chapter 1, I talked about getting help in Adobe Acrobat using some 
different help menu commands. There’s much more to getting help in 
Acrobat than I covered in Chapter 1. Therefore, a separate chapter 
detailing the specifics of various help options seems appropriate.
In addition to help documents, there are a number of resources installed in 
folders that you might want to become familiar with. Many resource files can 
be edited to customize your PDF creation and editing.
In this chapter, I talk about some of the help documents, Web links, and 
resources you have with Adobe Acrobat when you start up the program and 
when you begin to work on some different editing tasks.
Accessing Help
You can see the number of different commands and tools available in 
Acrobat is extraordinary — and you haven’t yet looked at all the submenu 
options or different preference options accessed from the top-level menu bar. 
With all these features available to you, your initial Acrobat sessions can 
sometimes be overwhelming. Fortunately, the great engineers and program 
designers at Adobe Systems thought about you and they decided to provide 
some help.
Help with learning more about Acrobat comes in several forms, and you can 
choose from several help methods to find the one that works well in your 
workflow. This section covers different options for getting help in an Acrobat 
session.

Using Resources
When you install Acrobat there are a number of files stored in various folders that are used for 
templates and different resources that assist you in your PDF creation and document editing. Some 
of these files can be modified and customized to suit your personal PDF creation needs.
Modifying the coversheet
Users of Acrobat 8 will remember the coversheet that appeared in PDF Packages. The 
coversheet.pdf file was installed with your Acrobat installation. You could modify this file 
to create a custom coversheet with data relevant to you or your company.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
In Acrobat 9 PDF Packages have given way to the new PDF Portfolios. PDF 
Portfolios enable you to create your own personal customized coversheets using 
several template configurations provided by Adobe, and new templates using Adobe Flex.
Since PDF Portfolios can only be viewed with the coversheet templates used in Acrobat 9, Adobe 
created a new coversheet that only opens when viewing PDF Portfolios in versions of Acrobat and 
Adobe Reader earlier than version 9. When Acrobat 7 or 8 users open a PDF Portfolio, the cover-
sheet they see is shown in Figure 3.9.
 FIGURE 3.9
PDF Portfolios display a coversheet created by Adobe when the Portfolios are viewed in Acrobat viewers 
earlier than version 9.

68
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
The coversheet shown in Figure 3.9 is a PDF document that resides in the folder:
 Acrobat 9.0/Acrobat/DocSettings/CombineFiles/ENU/coversheet.pdf 
(Windows)
 Applications/Acrobat 9 Pro/Adobe Acrobat Pro/Contents/Mac OS/
DocSettings/CombineFiles/ENU/coversheet.pdf (Macintosh)
Note that the ENU folder is for English language installations of Acrobat. Also note that Mac users 
need to open the Acrobat 9 Pro folder and open a context menu on the Acrobat 9 Pro application 
file. From the context menu commands choose Show Package Contents to display the Contents 
folder.
You can replace the file contained in the ENU folder with your own design. Just be certain to name 
the file coversheet.pdf.

For more information about creating custom coversheets for PDF Portfolios, see 
Chapter 12.
Modifying DocTemplates
Doc Templates are used with Security Envelopes. When you choose Create Security Envelope from 
the Secure Task button pull-down menu, a wizard opens where you can choose from three tem-
plates installed with your Acrobat installation. The template1.pdf file is shown in Figure 3.10.
The Security Envelope templates have several form fields that you can modify in Acrobat, or you 
can create new templates and add them to the folder Acrobat searches the DocTemplates folder for 
when creating a security envelope. The DocTemplates folder is located at:
 Acrobat 9.0/Acrobat/DocTemplates/ENU/ (Windows)
 Acrobat 9 Pro/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/DocTemplates
Note that you need to open the Adobe Acrobat Pro application folder on the Mac and open a con-
text menu on the program icon. From the menu options choose Show Package Contents to gain 
access to the Contents folder.
Inside the DocTemplates folder you’ll find the three files installed during your Acrobat installation. 
You can copy any file to this folder and the template will be shown in the wizard when you create 
a Security Envelope.
Be certain to add a Document Title in the Document Properties dialog box. The wizard uses the 
Document Title for a description of the document in the wizard when creating the Security 
Envelope.

information on adding Document Titles to PDF files, see Chapter 6.
Adding folder level JavaScripts
Whereas Adobe didn’t intend to have you interact with the coversheet document or DocTemplates 
folders, the JavaScripts folder is one that you are encouraged to use when folder level scripts are 
needed. This is most evident on the Mac because you don’t need to drill down through the appli-
cation supporting folders to find the JavaScripts folder.
 On Windows, open the Acrobat folder and you’ll find the JavaScripts folder.
 On the Mac, open your user logon folder and follow the path Library/Acrobat 
User Data/9.0_x86/JavaScripts.
You can add folder level JavaScripts to this folder that are executed at the time Acrobat is launched.

Adding custom stamps
Some more resources available to you include the many different stamps images you can add to the 
Stamp tool in all Acrobat viewers. Buy default only a few of the files are loaded as stamp libraries.
 On Windows you’ll find the libraries at Acrobat/plug_ins/Annotations/
Stamps/ENU.
 On the Mac you’ll find stamps at Contents/Plug-ins/Comments.acroplugin/
Stamps/ENU.
Before you arrive at the ENU folder inside the Stamps folder you’ll find a file called Words.pdf. 
This file has eight different images you can use as Stamp icons. When you open the ENU folder 
you’ll find Faces.pdf and Pointers.pdf, each containing 11 icons each. Any one of these 
files can be added as new stamps using the Manage Custom Stamps wizard in all Acrobat viewers.

For information related to creating and managing custom Stamps, see Chapter 20.
Using QuickBook templates (Windows only)
Another folder you find in the Acrobat folder on Windows is the QuickBooksTemplates folder. 
Open this folder and open the ENU folder and you find seven preinstalled templates for use with 
QuickBooks. In Figure 3.11, one of the seven templates is shown.
NEW FEATURE

For more information on working with QuickBooks templates, see Chapter 35.
Using LiveCycle Designer resource files
Inside the Designer 8.2 folder which resides inside the Acrobat folder you find the EN folder. 
Open this folder and you find two folders with some resource files. The Templates folder contains 
a number of templates you can use to start a form in LiveCycle Designer. If you create some cus-
tom forms and want to use them as templates, copy your template files to this folder.
The Samples folder inside the EN folder is where you’ll find some excellent examples of forms cre-
ated with LiveCycle Designer. If you’re new to Designer, be sure to look over the many samples 
you find here.

tations of the Adobe Reader software. In some situations you can 
distribute PDF documents to users of the free Adobe Reader soft-
ware for active participation in your workflow without all your clients and 
colleagues needing to purchase the full version of Acrobat Standard, Acrobat 
Pro, or Acrobat Pro Extended. In other situations where the Adobe Reader 
software does not contain tools or commands to properly edit a file for a 
given workflow, you may need to recommend to others which commercial 
viewer they need to purchase. Regardless of where you are with PDF creation 
and editing, at one time or another you’ll be called upon to explain some of 
the differences between Adobe Reader and the other viewers.
Adobe Reader has evolved and each new upgrade offers users much more 
functionality than previous versions. Features that users have long requested 
such as the ability to save form data and add digital signatures were added 
in Adobe Reader 8. Two more features requested by many users involved 
having a method for converting application documents to PDF and a no-
nonsense easy method for sharing files. Adobe Reader 9, combined with 
the new online Acrobat.com service, addresses these user requests.
Setting Some Critical Preferences
Like the Acrobat viewers, Adobe Reader has an enormous number of different 
preference options designed to add more functionality to the program and to 
help you tailor your workspace and tools to suit personal workflows.

Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
Preferences settings are detailed throughout this book in chapters that specifically relate to tools 
and commands. A few preference options you want to start with in Reader include some settings to 
help you prepare for some of the features described in other chapters.
Setting up an Acrobat.com account
Open Preferences by pressing Ctrl/Ô+K. In the left pane, click Acrobat.com. Preference options 
you have for adding account information for Acrobat.com are shown in Figure 4.1.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
Acrobat.com is a separate service provided free from Adobe. For a number of dif-
ferent tasks you perform in Acrobat including shared reviews, form distribution and 
collection, and sharing files online, you’ll want to take advantage of this service.
 FIGURE 4.1
Press Ctrl/Ô+K to open the Preferences dialog box and click Acrobat.com in the left pane.
To use Acrobat.com, you need to sign up with an Adobe ID and password. Once you’ve set up an 
account, add your email address (from your Adobe ID account) and your password if you want to 
log on automatically each time you use the service. If you want to connect to Acrobat.com auto-
matically when collaborating on documents set up for collaboration on Acrobat.com, check the 
Live Collaboration check box. Another check box is an option for copying email messages to your 
mail client each time you send an invitation for other users to engage in a comment and review 
session. Check this box if you want to copy messages to your email account.

Chapter 29. For information on collaboration in shared reviews, see Chapter 21.
Setting general preferences
Open the Preferences dialog box (Ctrl/Ô+K) and click General in the left pane. Check Use single-
key accelerators to access tools at the top of the right pane. When this check box is checked, you 
can access tools by pressing a key on your keyboard. For example, when another tool is selected, 
you can access the Hand tool by pressing the H key.
Setting identity preferences
You’ll also want to edit identity preferences. When you engage in comment reviews and add 
comments in review sessions, you’re prompted to edit your identity preferences. To prepare your 
work environment, take time now to add your identity information. Press Ctrl/Ô+K to open the 
Preferences dialog box and click Identity in the left pane. In the right pane, fill in the text boxes 
with your personal identity information as shown in Figure 4.2.
 FIGURE 4.2
Click Identity in the left pane and fill in the text boxes in the right pane to set up your identity preferences.
There are many more preferences you can adjust, but these few changes will get the Adobe Reader 
going for a good many viewing and editing sessions. After you make your edits in the Preferences 
dialog box, you’re ready to go. Reader writes the preferences immediately so there’s no need to quit 
the program and reopen to use the new preference choices.
Using Adobe Reader Tools and Menus
What distinguishes Adobe Reader and other viewers are, in part, the tools and menu commands. 
Knowing what the user can do with the Reader tools and what tools are not available in Reader is 
helpful if you intend to distribute documents to Reader users.

76
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
All tools available in Adobe Reader have counterparts in Acrobat Standard (Windows), Acrobat 
Pro, and Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows). The Reader tools are the same in the other viewers; 
however, some of the Adobe Reader tools offer more limited features than the same tools used in 
the other viewers.
Loading tools and toolbars
Before you take a look at the individual tools you have available in Reader, you should know how 
you go about loading tools and toolbars. A toolbar contains one or more tools that can be added or 
temporarily removed from a toolbar. You have one of two ways to access a window where toolbars 
are loaded and tools respective to a toolbar are added and removed.
Select Tools ➪ Customize Toolbars or open a context menu on a toolbar in the Toolbar Well (right-
click on Windows or Ctrl+click on the Mac) and select More Tools, as shown in Figure 4.3. Accessing 
either Tools ➪ Customize Toolbars or the More Tools menu command opens the More Tools win-
dow shown in Figure 4.4.
 FIGURE 4.3
Open a context menu on a toolbar in the Toolbar Well and select More Tools at the bottom of the menu to 
open the More Tools window.
The More Tools window shown in Figure 4.4 is a scrollable window listing the various toolbars 
available to Adobe Reader. Toolbars appear in the list as a parent item. Indented below each tool-
bar are the tools you can display in the respective toolbar. For example, the first toolbar is the 
Analysis toolbar. Below the toolbar you see three tools (each denoted as a tool) indented below 
the parent toolbar. When you click the check box for Analysis Toolbar, the toolbar opens in the 
Acrobat window.

77

 FIGURE 4.4
Check the tools and toolbars you want shown in the Reader workspace.
Click the check mark adjacent to a toolbar name and the toolbar opens as a floating toolbar in the 
Document pane. All tools marked with a check mark appear loaded in the toolbar. To hide tools 
from a given toolbar, uncheck the tools you want to remain hidden.
Once a toolbar is opened in Reader, you can dock the toolbar(s) by opening a context menu from 
the Toolbar Well and selecting Dock Toolbars. The toolbars are then organized within the Toolbar 
Well.
TIP
TIP
Once you have a toolbar open in the Acrobat window, you can load and remove 
tools from the toolbar without returning to the More Tools window. Open a context 
menu on a toolbar — either a floating toolbar or one docked in the Toolbar Well. All tools 
assigned to the toolbar are displayed in the menu. You check or uncheck individual tools to 
open/close them.
At the bottom of the More Tools window, you see a note indicating that the tools are only available 
when document rights are enabled. Note that the Measuring tool in the Analysis toolbar and all the 
Comment & Markup tools shown in Figure 4.4 appear with an asterisk (*). These tools are only 
available in Adobe Reader when you open a document that has been enabled with Adobe Reader 
usage rights.

For more information on PDFs with usage rights, see “Enabling Adobe Reader 
Usage Rights” later in this chapter.
Getting familiar with the Reader tools
The first thing to understand about tools in Adobe Reader is you have two different tool 
sets dependent on the kind of PDF file you open. In addition, you have a few different menu 
commands depending on the kind of PDF file you open.
If you open a PDF document with no special usage rights, you have fewer accessible tools and menu 
commands than when you open PDFs having extended features. Notice that when you open the 
More Tools window, the second toolbar you see is the Comment & Markup toolbar. If you open 
a PDF file that isn’t enabled for commenting, you can’t open the Comment & Markup toolbar. If 
you open a file that has extended features for Adobe Reader for commenting, then you can open 
the Comment & Markup tools.
Default tools
To start off a discussion on Adobe Reader tools, let’s first take a look at the tools you have available 
when opening a PDF document with no special features. In this section, I refer to these tools as the 
default tools. Later, I’ll talk about the additional tools you have available when opening files having 
special features.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more on PDFs with special features, see “Enabling Adobe Reader Usage Rights” 
later in this chapter. For enabling features with Acrobat, see Chapter 19.
The Adobe Reader tools available to you when working on PDFs without special usage rights 
include the following:
 Analysis toolbar. By default the Analysis toolbar displays two tools when you load the 
toolbar. The Object Data toolbar, explained in Chapter 1, is used to select objects (text, 
images, or vector art) on a document page. When you select an object with this tool, the 
Object Data dialog box opens and displays information about an object that was origi-
nally supplied in an authoring program. The Object Data tool works only with objects 
where certain metadata were originally supplied in another program such as AutoCAD or 
Microsoft Visio. The Geospatial tool reports geospatial data such as longitude and latitude 
on files where the data have been added. If a file is enabled with Adobe Reader usage 
rights, the Measuring tool is added to the toolbar.
CROSS-REF

 Edit toolbar. The Edit tools include Spell Check, Undo, Redo, and Copy.
 File toolbar. The File tools include the familiar tools from earlier Acrobat viewers Open, 
Print, Save a Copy, Search, and Email. New in Acrobat 9 are the Share tool and the Create 
Adobe PDF Online tool. The Share tool is similar to a Task button with a pull-down 
menu where commands offer you options for sharing files on Acrobat.com. Create Adobe 
PDF Online is a revised online service for Reader users who can now create PDFs in real 
time by sending them to Acrobat.com without a service fee for the first files you convert 
to PDF. After using the service to convert five files, you can continue using a subscription 
service.
NOTE
NOTE
Using the free service to convert up to five files to PDF is a lifetime free service. 
Once you’ve converted five files to PDF, you must use a paid subscription to 
convert additional files.

 Find toolbar. The Find tool enables you to perform a text search in the open PDF 
document.
CROSS-REF

For information related to using the Find toolbar, see Chapter 6.
 Page Display. The tools all relate to the document display in the Reader workspace. You 
can view pages as single page layouts, continuous, facing, and so on. The Full Screen tool 
takes you into Full Screen mode. Tools for rotating pages and viewing line weights at 
1-pixel widths are also included in this toolbar.

Using menu commands
In addition to tools, Adobe Reader 9 contains some important menu commands that you’ll want to 
understand.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
Under the File menu you find some new Acrobat 9 menu commands. The File ➪ 
Create Adobe PDF Using Acrobat.com menu command is used to submit files to 
Acrobat.com for conversion to PDF. This feature was available in earlier versions of Acrobat, 
but now rests with the Acrobat.com service, where you can convert up to five files free. After 
converting five files, the service is available as a paid subscription. The File ➪ Collaborate menu 
command has a submenu that includes the following commands:
 Upload Documents to Acrobat.com. Select this command to upload documents to 
Acrobat.com.
 Share Documents on Acrobat.com. Use this command to share files with other users on 
Acrobat.com.

82
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat

 Create Buzzword Document (English only version). Buzzword is a Web-based real-time 
Adobe word-processing application with an Adobe Flash interface. When you choose this 
command you are presented with a logon screen in your default Web browser. Either log 
on with your Adobe ID or sign up for a new account. After signing in, the Buzzword Web 
page opens as shown in Figure 4.5. Using Buzzword you can edit documents together in 
a group with other users to make text edits, add comments, make revisions, and publish 
documents in real time.
 FIGURE 4.5
Choose File ➪ Collaborate ➪ Create Buzzword Document and log on to Adobe’s 
Buzzword Web site.
 Share My Screen. Acrobat Connect, introduced with the release of Acrobat and Adobe 
Reader 8, offered you a meeting room to conduct online meetings. You needed a Connect 
account and you had to pay an annual fee for the service. Now in Acrobat 9 you can host 
meetings using the free Adobe Reader software for up to three participants without a ser-
vice fee using Acrobat ConnectNow.

Using Navigation panels
Navigation panels that are open by default are docked in the Navigation pane. Depending on the 
content of a PDF file, you may see different panels open when viewing different documents. For 
example, if a document containing a digital signature opens in Reader, the Signatures panel is docked 
in the Navigation pane. If a document contains Adobe PDF layers, the Layers panel is docked in 
the Navigation pane.
You can open panels in any document by choosing a menu command. To view all the Navigation 
panels, select View ➪ Navigation Panels. A submenu contains all the Navigation panels you can 
access in Reader, as shown in Figure 4.6. When you open a panel, it opens as a floating window. 
Click the panel tab and drag it to the Navigation pane, where you can dock it together with the 
default panels.

Select View ➪ Navigation Panels to see the Navigation panels available in Reader. When documents with 
special usage rights are open, the Document Extensions and Signatures panels are accessible.
Working with Signatures
Open the Document menu and you find the Sign, Security, and Security Settings commands. If you 
want Adobe Reader users to digitally sign a document, they must create a digital signature. These 
commands are used to create signatures, manage signatures, and sign documents.

Adobe Reader, like the other Acrobat viewers, displays a separate interface when 
viewing PDF Portfolios. In the PDF Portfolio interface you find additional tools and 
menu commands. The view you see in Adobe Reader (see Figure 4.7) is very similar to the view 
displayed in Acrobat viewers. The one view you don’t have displays the Edit Portfolio panel used 
for editing PDF Portfolios or modifying the Portfolio.

NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
If a little voice popped up as you turn pages in this book, you’d hear me frequently 
exclaim that Acrobat.com and all the related features you have for working with 
documents using Acrobat.com are, in my opinion, the best single new feature introduced in any 
Adobe program over the past two decades. I believe Acrobat.com is perhaps the single greatest 
reason you should encourage all Adobe Reader users to upgrade to Adobe Reader 9.

85
Getting Familiar with Adobe Reader

All of what you can do with Acrobat.com and your documents is covered in Chapter 29. In terms 
of Adobe Reader users, there are a few distinctions you have related to the available services. For 
starters, Adobe Reader users cannot enable a PDF for commenting and cannot initiate a comment 
and review session. Therefore, Reader users cannot submit files for review in the same regard as 
the Acrobat users can.
Reader users, however, can share files on Acrobat.com, and other users of the Acrobat software 
can add comments. Reader users can also initiate and participate in online meetings for up to three 
people without purchasing an Acrobat Connect account. Furthermore, Reader users can submit 
native authoring application documents for PDF creation without any service fees — again only 
five files free as a lifetime service then offered on a subscription fee basis.
Creating PDF files using Acrobat.com
If your clients or colleagues don’t have Acrobat Standard or one of the Acrobat Pro products and 
they need to create an occasional PDF file, they can download the free Adobe Reader 9 software 
and choose File ➪ Create Adobe PDF Using Acrobat.com. The Adobe Share dialog box opens as 
shown in Figure 4.8. A user needs to have an account to sign on or click Create an Adobe ID to 
Sign Up for the service.
 FIGURE 4.8
Choose File ➪ Create Adobe PDF Using Acrobat.com and sign on to submit files for conversion to PDF.

86
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
You are then taken to Acrobat.com. In the Acrobat.com interface, click the Create PDF button. 
Click Browse  as you see in Figure 4.9. A Browse dialog box opens where you can select the file to 
upload. Select one or more files and click Open.
 FIGURE 4.9
Click Create PDF in Acrobat.com, select a file, and click Upload to upload a native file for PDF conversion.
The wonderful thing about using the new Create PDF feature in Acrobat 9 and Acrobat.com is that 
your work is performed in real time. The server displays a progress bar as your file(s) is converted. 
When finished with the conversion, you open a drop-down menu ad. Choose Download to down-
load the file. There’s no waiting for an email and a link to locate a file. Everything is performed in 
real time, and your files are added to your Acrobat.com workspace for downloading any time or 
place you choose.
Create PDF supports many different file formats. The native document formats are as follows:
 Microsoft Office. All Microsoft Office files for Mac and Windows.
 Other Microsoft formats. Microsoft Publisher is supported.
 Adobe formats. Those programs not supporting direct export to PDF, such as earlier ver-
sions of PageMaker without the PDF plug-in, are supported. All Creative Suite programs 
now support export to PDF, and using a service to create PDF files is not necessary.

87

 Adobe Flash files. Adobe Flash .flv and .swf file formats can be converted.
 AutoDesk AutoCAD. AutoCAD is supported.
 CAD File formats. A huge range of different CAD formats can be converted.
 Corel WordPerfect Office formats. Corel WordPerfect files can be converted to PDF.
 Adobe PostScript formats. Any program you use that’s capable of printing can be printed 
to disk as a PostScript file. You can submit the PostScript file for conversion to PDF.
 Text formats. All ASCII (American Code for Information Interchange) and Rich Text 
Format (RTF) files can be converted to PDF.
 Image formats. Most of the common image formats such as Windows bitmap (.bmp), 
GIF (.gif), JPEG (.jpg/.jpeg), PCX (.pcx), PICT (Macintosh) (.pct/.pict), PNG (.png), RLE 
(.rle), and TIFF (.tif) can be converted to PDF.
CROSS-REF

For information on converting native application documents to PDF, see Chapters 7 
through 9. For information on printing PostScript files and converting PostScript 
files to PDF, see Chapter 10.
Sharing files on Acrobat.com
Adobe Reader users can share files on Acrobat.com and invite selected users to download the shared 
documents. Open the File menu and choose Collaborate ➪ Upload Documents to Acrobat.com. 
Any original authoring document can be uploaded for sharing.
Like other Acrobat.com services, you need to have an Adobe ID and log on with your account 
information. After logging on, your default Web browser takes you to the Acrobat.com Web site 
where you can initiate an upload.
When you arrive at Acrobat.com you have some options for who will see your shared file(s), an 
email address field for your recipient(s), a subject field for the email, and a message box as shown 
in Figure 4.10. Browse your hard drive to select the file you want to upload and fill in the fields for 
the email. Click the Share button and your default email client opens with a new message window 
that includes the To, Subject, and Message content you completed in Acrobat.com. Click the Send 
button and the email is sent to your recipient(s) with a file hypertext link for where the recipient(s) 
can download the file.

Enabling Adobe Reader Usage Rights
To create a Reader-enabled document for certain usage rights, you need Acrobat Standard, Pro, Pro 
Extended, or Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES. In Acrobat Standard, Pro, and Pro Extended 
you can add usage rights that enable an Adobe Reader user to comment on a PDF file, save the 
comments, invite Reader users to participate in an email–based review or shared review, save form 
data, and add digital signatures.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For a complete description of using comment tools, starting an email review, or 
starting a shared review, see Chapter 20. For more on saving form data from within 
Reader, see Chapter 34.
All the comment and forms usage rights are enabled in one of the other Acrobat viewers. When you 
want to distribute a document for Reader users to mark up and comment, choose Comments ➪ 
Enable for Commenting and Analysis in Adobe Reader. When you want to distribute forms you 
use the Advanced ➪ The Enable Usage Rights in Adobe Reader command to open the dialog box 
shown in Figure 4.11. Click the Save Now button and the PDF is enabled for commenting, saving 
form data, and adding digital signatures.

For more on enabling PDFs with Reader usage rights, see Chapter 19.
 FIGURE 4.11
With a simple menu command in Acrobat Pro or Pro Extended, you can enable PDFs for Adobe Reader 
users for commenting, saving data on forms, and adding digital signatures.
Commenting in Adobe Reader
Remember that you need to grant a PDF document usage rights in, Standard, Pro, or Pro Extended 
by choosing Comments ➪ Enable for Commenting and Analysis in Adobe Reader before a Reader 
user can make comments. When the file is enabled with usage rights, the Comment & Markup 
tools are accessible. If an Adobe Reader user opens a PDF document without usage rights enabled, 
the comment tools are not accessible.
NOTE
NOTE
Some other actions, such as starting a shared review or distributing a form, auto-
matically enable PDFs for Reader users when you step through the wizards used to 
initiate the sharing.
Notice that Adobe Reader users have access to all comment and markup tools, as well as the ability 
to create and use custom stamps. When an Adobe Reader user marks up a document with the 
commenting tools, the file can be saved and the comments preserved. Documents enabled with 
usage rights also include a File ➪ Save command. By default, Adobe Reader permits saving an 
unedited copy of a PDF document only if usage rights are not enabled.

Using file attachments
A file attachment is an external file that can be a PDF document or any other document saved from 
any program. The PDF acts as a wrapper container for the file attachment. File attachments can be 
extracted and saved to disk outside the PDF or opened in the native application in which the origi-
nal document was created. In order to view a document in a native application, the original author-
ing program must be installed on your computer.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on attaching and extracting files, see Chapter 20.
Another feature available in Adobe Reader is the ability to extract file attachments. Files can be 
attached to a PDF by a Reader user when a PDF document is enabled with usage rights for Adobe 
Reader users. When an Acrobat user attaches a file to a PDF, Adobe Reader users can extract the 
file attachments. A separate tab in the Navigation pane enables the Reader user to open, save, and 
search file attachments. Click the Attachments tab to open a panel where you can access tools to 
manage the attachments.
One great feature in all Acrobat viewers is the ability to attach any file type to a PDF document and 
secure the PDF with password protection. After a PDF has been encrypted with password security, 
the end user needs the access password in order to either open the PDF document or extract the 
attachment. With the process accessible to Adobe Reader users, business professionals in all indus-
tries will find much greater use for Adobe Reader 9.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on adding permissions rights with Acrobat security, see Chapter 26.
Working with forms in Adobe Reader
The other half of enabling PDF documents for Adobe Reader users involves adding usage rights for 
saving PDF forms and adding digital signatures.
When you select Advanced ➪ Extend Features in Adobe Reader in one of the other Acrobat viewers 
and click the Save Now button, your files are enabled for commenting, saving form data, and using 
digital signatures in Adobe Reader. As soon as you open a PDF with usage rights, you’ll notice the 
Save command available in the File menu. The Reader user can then save any form data you add to 
form fields. In addition to saving form data, you can also create and use digital signatures on docu-
ments enabled with usage rights as well as add comments.
When you enable files for Reader users to save form data, some restrictions apply. You need to be 
aware of the stipulations in the End User License Agreement (EULA) and the limitations detailed in 
this agreement.

You may look over the new Adobe Reader 9 and wish for more features or wonder why Adobe 
Systems didn’t add more to the newest release. If the thought occurs to you, keep in mind that 
Adobe Systems offers the Reader software free of charge. Adobe Reader is certainly one of the most 
feature-rich applications that can be acquired without purchase.
If you want more from Adobe Reader, you do have other purchase options available to you from 
Adobe Systems. From PDF creation to saving form data for enterprise solutions, Adobe does make 
these features available to you in the form of online services and server-side applications.
For users of earlier versions of Acrobat, Reader Extensions enabled users of Adobe Reader versions 
below 7.0 to perform comment and markup, save forms, and digital signatures functions. Adobe 
LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES is an enterprise solution intended for large companies that have 
the technology and resources to offer cost-effective solutions for many users, or those who want to 
automate processes like adding these enabling rights to PDFs.
The addition of enabling documents for Reader users in Acrobat Standard, Pro, or Pro Extended 
to save form data and Pro/Pro Extended to add digital signatures carries limitations in the End 
User License Agreement. For enterprise solutions where the needs exceed the licensing limitations, 
Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES offers unlimited use of PDF files enabled with usage rights.
For information about Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES, log on to Adobe’s Web site at www.
adobe.com/products/readerextensions/. You’ll find more information about the server-side software 
and how to acquire it for your company.
Summary
 Acrobat.com is a separate service offered by Adobe Systems and has nothing to do with 
the Acrobat 9.0 release. But Acrobat 9 viewers have many menu commands that can access 
the service for creating PDF files, sharing documents, and engaging in online meetings.
 Acrobat.com services are offered free everyone in the world.
 Adobe Reader usage rights are enabled in Acrobat Standard (Windows), Pro, and Pro 
Extended (Windows). When a PDF has been enabled with commenting, form data saving, 
and digital signatures usage rights, Reader users can comment and mark up a document, 
participate in an email–based review, save comment updates, save data on PDF forms, 
and add digital signatures.

 File attachments can be extracted from within Adobe Reader. When usage rights have 
been enabled in a PDF document, Adobe Reader users can attach files to PDFs.
 Help and product performance options are available from menu commands in the Help 
menu.
 Adobe Systems provides an online service for converting files saved in a number of differ-
ent formats to PDF. You can easily access Acrobat.com where files can be submitted for 
conversion to PDF via menu commands in Reader.
 Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES is a J2EE-based server-side solution intended for 
automating the addition of user rights as well as meeting the needs for large-scale enable-
ment requirements. With the Reader Extensions Server you can enable PDFs for using 
web services, spawning templates, decoding 2D barcodes, saving form data, and digitally 
signing PDFs from within Adobe Reader.

A
crobat viewers provide you with many different kinds of tools to 
view pages and move around PDF documents. As a visitor to PDFs 
created by other PDF authors, you can use many tools within the 
program to browse pages and find information quickly. As a PDF author 
you can create viewing options and links to views you know will help the 
end user explore your files. In this chapter, I cover all viewing tools, pages, 
documents, and the different kinds of viewing options you have available in 
Acrobat viewers. I leave the authoring items and how-to methods to other 
chapters. For now, just realize this chapter is an abbreviated form of looking 
at a huge list of possibilities for viewing and navigation. The amplified expla-
nations follow in several other chapters.
If you’re familiar with Acrobat 8 viewers, you’ll find little change with view-
ing options in Acrobat 9, with the exception of viewing documents in the 
new Acrobat 9 PDF Portfolio feature. Most of the tools in Acrobat 9 are very 
similar to viewing tools you used in Acrobat 8.
Setting Up the Work Environment
At the beginning of all subsequent chapters, I begin the chapter by offering 
suggestions for setting up your work environment. As you can see in Chapter 1, 
all the Acrobat viewers contain many tools and panels, and most of these 
tools and panels are hidden when you first launch the program. Because 
Acrobat can do so many things for so many different working professionals, 
Adobe Systems didn’t intend for you to use all the tools and panels in each 
editing session. Therefore, you have the opportunity to open and hide differ-
ent tools and panels depending on the kind of edits you want to make. As

Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
you begin each chapter, look over the section related to setting up the work environment for sug-
gestions on what tools and panels should be loaded to follow along as you read a chapter.
Open a context menu (right-click Windows or Control+click Mac) on the Toolbar Well and click 
More Tools. Scroll to the Page Navigation Toolbar and check all tools.
Scroll down to the File Toolbar and select the Organizer tool. Scroll to the Page Display Toolbar 
and check all tools. Scroll further down to the Select & Zoom Toolbar and check all tools. Click 
OK in the More Tools window.
Open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and select Dock Toolbars. Return to the context menu 
and select Button Labels ➪ All Labels. This view shows the names of tools within toolbars to help 
you become more familiar with tool names.
After loading toolbars and making choices in the context menu opened from the Toolbar Well, 
your Toolbar Well should look like Figure 5.1.
 FIGURE 5.1
The Viewing and Page Display toolbars loaded in the Toolbar Well
As is explained in this chapter, several tools and menu commands provide a means for navigating 
pages and documents. When you’re familiar with alternative methods, you can leave the Navigation 
toolbar hidden, especially if you’re using other toolbars that occupy a lot of room in the Toolbar 
Well. If you’re new to Acrobat, keep the Navigation toolbar open as you work through this chapter.
Arranging Toolbars in the Acrobat Window
As you first start working with Acrobat, you’ll want to make some adjustments to Preferences and 
setting up your work environment. Follow these steps to configure the program for most of the 
work you intend to do for any editing session:
STEPS: Organizing the Acrobat workplace
 
1. Set Preferences. A couple of Preference items will get you to a more familiar look when 
using Acrobat 8. Open the Preferences dialog box by pressing Ctrl/Ô+K. Alternately, on 
Windows choose Edit ➪ Preferences and on the Mac choose Acrobat ➪ Preferences. The 
preference items to change include the following:

97
Viewing and Navigating PDF Files
5
 Enable single key accelerators. Click General in the left pane to open the General 
preferences. This option has always appeared off by default in Acrobat viewers since 
the preference was added to the General preferences. Check the box for Use single-key 
accelerators to access tools. Doing so means that when you’re working on a document 
and you want to easily access the Zoom tool, you press the Z key. Pressing H gets you 
the Hand tool, and so on.
 
There are many more preferences that apply to specific editing tasks and they are 
covered when we come to specific features in Acrobat 9 in forthcoming chapters. 
 For now, these preferences in Acrobat can help shape your editing environment for 
viewing and navigating PDF files. Remember though, these are all personal prefer-
ences and you can feel free to change items to suit your workflow.
 Always show document page size. Click Page Display in the left pane to open the 
Page Display preferences. In earlier versions of Acrobat, a document’s page size was 
reported in the document window. This is a critical bit of information for engineers, 
creative pros, and others who work with files other than standard letter sizes. By 
default, the information is not displayed. In the Page Display preferences check the 
box for Always show document page size.
NOTE
NOTE
If you don’t have the Always show document page size preference enabled, you can 
see document page sizes by moving the cursor to the lower left corner of a page. A 
pop-up display opens when the cursor is positioned in the lower left corner, reporting page 
sizes in the current established units of measure.
 Rendering. Another Page Display preference you’ll want to adjust is the Smoothed 
Text setting. If you use a laptop or LCD monitor, open the Smooth Text pull-down 
menu and choose For Laptop/LCD Monitors.
 Set Identity Preferences. Click Identity in the left pane of the Preferences dialog box. 
The information in the field boxes on the right is used with certain tools such as com-
ment and markup, creating security envelopes, and with form workflows.
 
2. Quit Acrobat. After you customize your toolbars and preference settings, quit Acrobat. 
Acrobat remembers the last settings you made to the toolbars arrangement. Just in case 
you start moving toolbars around for temporary views, you can return to your initial 
default by first quitting Acrobat, then restating the program.
 
3. Relaunch Acrobat. Open Acrobat and your settings will appear as you left them before 
quitting.
Navigating PDF Documents
You can navigate pages in an Acrobat viewer via several means. You can scroll pages with tools, 
menus, and keystrokes; click hypertext links; and use dialog boxes to move through multiple 
documents and individual pages. Depending on how a PDF file is created and edited, you can 
also follow Web links and articles through different sections of a document or through multiple 

98

documents. All Acrobat viewers have many navigation controls and several ways to go about view-
ing and navigating PDF pages.
Navigation toolbar
The tools for navigation in Acrobat Pro Extended and other Acrobat viewers shown in Figure 5.2 
with All Labels viewed are as follows:
 First Page. In the current active document, the First Page tool returns you to the first 
page in the document.
 Previous Page. The Previous Page tool moves you back one page at a time. Note that the 
icon for the Previous Page tool has changed in Acrobat 9 to an up arrow.
 Next Page. The Next Page tool scrolls forward through pages one page at a time. Note 
that the icon for the Previous Page tool has changed in Acrobat 9 to a down arrow.
 Last Page. The Last Page tool moves you to the last page in the document.
 Go to Previous View. The Go to Previous View tool returns you to the last view displayed 
on your screen. Whereas the four preceding tools are limited to navigation through a single 
open document, the Go to Previous View tool returns you to the previous view even if 
the last view was another file.
 Go to Next View. The Go to Next View tool behaves the same as the Go to Previous View 
tool except it moves in a forward direction. Use of the Go to Previous View and Go to 
Next View tools can be especially helpful when navigating links that open and close doc-
uments. The Next Page and Last Page tools confine you to the active document; whereas 
the Go to Previous View and Go to Next View tools retrace your navigation steps regard-
less of how many files you have viewed.
Clicking one of the tools in the toolbar invokes the action associated with the tool. If you want to 
move through pages left or right, click the left or right arrows. If you want to go to the first or last 
page in the file, click the respective tools described earlier.
 FIGURE 5.2
The Page Navigation toolbar shows the icon and name for each tool when the Button Labels ➪ All Labels 
menu selection is made from a context menu command opened from the Toolbar Well.

Context menus
Acrobat viewers make use of context menu commands for page navigation. To use a context menu 
for moving forward and back in PDF pages and documents, select the Hand tool and click the 
right mouse button (Windows and two-button Macs) or Control+click (Macintosh) to open the 
context menu as shown in Figure 5.3.
 FIGURE 5.3
Context menus opened on a document page using the Hand tool offer navigation commands to move 
forward and backward one page at a time and to previous and next views.
 
Navigation menu commands
The View menu contains all the page navigation commands contained in the Navigation toolbar. 
Notice that the View menu clearly describes viewing operations, and new users should be easily 
able to find menu commands associated with views.
Inasmuch as the View menu enables you to select menu commands that perform the same opera-
tions as those performed with the Navigation toolbar, you might opt for using the toolbar or key-
board shortcuts to navigate pages because other methods for page navigation are much easier than 
returning to menu commands. The real value in the View menu is all the other viewing commands 
you have accessible. The View menu contains many commands for viewing not only pages, but 
also toolbars and task buttons. When you choose View ➪ Go To, the page navigation commands 
appear in a submenu, as shown in Figure 5.4.
Those viewing commands, apart from the same options you have for navigation with the Navigation 
toolbar, include commands for viewing tools, for various page views, and alternatives to viewing 
such as the Reading mode, Read Out Loud, and scrolling pages automatically. Following is a list of 
what you can find in the View menu.

100
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
 FIGURE 5.4
The View menu contains many different commands for viewing pages, toolbars, and task buttons.
Go To
The commands that are equal to the actions you perform with the Navigation tools are contained 
in the Go To submenu. You can choose any of the Navigation commands in this menu and the 
results are the same as using tools and keyboard shortcuts. You’ll probably avoid using the 
Navigation commands because using any one of the other methods to scroll through pages is so 
much easier. The exception is the Go To ➪ Page command. When you select Go To ➪ Page or press 
Shift+Ctrl/Ô+N, the Go To Page dialog box opens. Type a number in the text box and click OK 
and you jump to that page number.
TIP
TIP
You can quickly jump to a page by typing a page number in the text box adjacent to 
the Last Page tool in the Page Navigation toolbar.
Zoom
A submenu provides menu options for zooming to different views. For more information on using 
the Zoom options, see “Zooming” later in this chapter. In addition to zooming in and out with 
tools and commands, the View ➪ Zoom submenu has a command for reflowing documents.
 Reflow. Document reflow enables users to view PDF documents on adaptive devices 
for the visually impaired and it is used when copying PDF files to handheld devices and 
tablets. When you reflow text onscreen or when using other devices, the text in the PDF 
wraps according to the zoom level of the page or the device viewing area. Therefore, when 
you zoom in on a paragraph of text and the text moves off the viewing area of your screen, 
you can use the Reflow command to make the text automatically scroll to your window 
size.

101
Viewing and Navigating PDF Files

Reflow only works with tagged PDF documents in Acrobat viewers earlier than version 7. 
Acrobat 7 through 9 viewers can reflow any PDF document whether it is a tagged file or 
not. When you copy PDF documents to handheld devices such as Palm Pilots, Adobe 
Reader for Palm software wraps text to fit the width of the screen for untagged as well as 
tagged documents.

For information about tagging PDF documents, see Chapters 10 and 25.
Page Display
The Page Display view can be any one of four different layout types. Choices for page layout are 
contained in the View ➪ Page Display submenu and also the Page Display toolbar. Depending on 
the way a PDF file has been saved and depending on what preference choices are made for the 
Initial View, a PDF layout may appear different on different computers according to each individ-
ual user’s preference settings. Regardless of how you set your preferences, you can change the Page 
Display view at any time.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on setting Initial View preferences, see “Setting Initial View 
Attributes” later in this chapter.
 
  Single Page. This layout places an entire page in view when the zoom level is set to Fit 
Page. When you press the Page Down key or the down-arrow key to scroll pages, the 
next page snaps into view.
 
  Single Page Continuous. Formerly labeled Continuous in Acrobat 7 and earlier viewers. 
This page layout view show pages in a linear fashion, where you might see the bottom of 
one page and the top of another page in the Document pane as you scroll down. The dif-
ference between this view and Single Page views is that the pages don’t snap to a full page 
when viewed as Single Page Continuous.
 
  Two-Up. Formerly labeled Facing in Acrobat 7 and earlier viewers. This view shows two 
pages — like looking at an open book. When the zoom level is set to Fit Page or lower, 
only two pages are in view in the Document pane.
 
  Two-Up Continuous. Formerly Continuous–Facing in Acrobat 7 and earlier viewers. 
This page layout view displays a combination of the preceding two options. When the 
zoom level is zoomed out, the view displays as many pages in the Document pane as can 
be accommodated by the zoom level.
 Show Gaps Between Pages. When you select View ➪ Page Display ➪ Show Gaps 
Between Pages, the page views for Single Page, Two-Up, and Two-Up Continuous are 
displayed as you see on the left side of Figure 5.5. Remove the check mark by the menu 
command and the display shown on the right appears.

102
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
 FIGURE 5.5
Show Gaps Between Pages is turned on in the left side and off in the right side of the 
figure.
 Show Cover Page During Two-Up. When you view a document in a Two-Up page lay-
out, page 1 and 2 are first shown in the Document pane. Click the Next Page tool and the 
Document pane shows you pages 3 and 4. If you want to show pages 2 and 3 together, 
select View ➪ Page Display ➪ Show Cover Page During Two-Up. If a document has more 
than two pages, the Two Columns and Two Pages views display the first page alone on 
the right side of the Document pane to ensure proper display of two-page spreads.
Rotate View
 
 If your PDF opens in Acrobat with a rotated view, you can rotate pages
 clockwise or counterclockwise from two submenu commands. The 
same rotations are also available in the Page Display tools. Rotate View commands and tools rotate 
all pages in your PDF document and come in handy if the PDF pages are rotated on the initial view 
or if you want to view PDFs on eBook readers, tablets, or laptop computers. However, changes 
made with the Rotate View tools or the View menu commands are temporary and any saves you 
make do not record the rotated views. Another set of rotation commands is available in the 
Document menu. When you select Document ➪ Rotate Pages, a dialog box opens where you can 
choose Counterclockwise 90 degrees, Clockwise 90 degrees, or 180 degrees. When using the 
Document menu and the Rotate pages dialog box, the rotation views can be saved with the file.

Reading mode
When you open a PDF document you can choose to view the file in one of two modes where the 
Acrobat menu remains visible. The two views include the default editing mode and Reading mode. 
Another mode available to you is Full Screen mode; however, in this mode the menu bar is hidden.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on Full Screen mode, see Chapter 28.
The Reading mode command changes the view of PDF files in the Acrobat window. To switch to 
Reading mode, select View ➪ Reading mode or press Alt+H (Windows) or Control +Ô+H (Mac). 
The screen view immediately changes to a different view. All toolbars are temporarily hidden and 
the Navigation panel likewise disappears. If you have floating toolbars open, the toolbars are hidden 
when you enter Reading mode. Floating navigation panels remain in view when in Reading mode.
Reading mode provides you with more space dedicated to your document without the interference 
of the Toolbar Well and Navigation panel. This mode makes it especially easier to devote your 
attention to reading document pages on laptop and tablet computers.
To understand some of the advantages for using Reading mode, follow these steps:
STEPS: Changing a view to Reading mode
 
1. Open a document in Acrobat. Use a file you are most likely to read such as a manual, a 
book, or essay.
 
2. Change the view to a Two Page layout. Click the Two-Up tool in the Page Display tool-
bar in the Toolbar Well. Note that the tool should be visible if you loaded the tools men-
tioned in the section “Setting Up the Work Environment” at the beginning of this chapter.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on Page Layout views, see the “Changing Page Views” section 
later in this chapter.
 
3. Open the Comment & Markup toolbar. If you review a file or read an eBook, you might 
want to make some notes on the file. However, you can’t stay in Reading mode if a tool-
bar is opened. Selecting a toolbar (View ➪ Toolbars ➪ Comment & Markup, for example) 
switches back to the standard edit mode as you see in Figure 5.6.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on using Comment & Markup tools, see Chapter 20.
 
4. Change the view to Reading mode. After making edits with tools such as the Comment 
& Markup tools, you can return to Reading mode by pressing Alt+H (Windows) or Ctrl/
Ô+H (Mac).

104
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat

 FIGURE 5.6
When you load toolbars in Reading mode, the view changes to a normal Viewer mode.
 
5. Scroll through the document pages. Navigating pages in Reading mode is not a problem 
without having the Navigation tools available. Move the cursor to the elevator bar on the 
right side of the Document pane and click the mouse button. As you move the bar up or 
down, you see a thumbnail view of pages as you scroll, as shown in Figure 5.7.
 
6. Exit Reading mode. Press Alt+H (Windows) or Ctrl/Ô+H (Mac) and you return to the 
default editing mode.
TIP
TIP
You can also scroll pages forward using the Right or Down Arrow key or the Page 
Down key. To scroll to previous pages use the Left or Up Arrow key or the Page Up 
Key. To jump to the first page in a document press the Home key. To jump to the last page in a 
document, press the End key.

Full Screen mode
Full Screen mode displays your documents without toolbars, menu bar, and Navigation panel. 
Many options exist for using Full Screen mode. See Chapter 28 for more information.
Menu Bar
Select View ➪ Menu Bar or press F9 (Windows) and the menu bar is temporarily hidden. To bring 
back the menu bar, press F9 (Windows).
If you’re a Mac user working on OS X Leopard, the F9 function key used by Acrobat for hiding 
menu bars is occupied by OS X’s default system shortcuts for Spaces and Exposé. If you want to 
make use of Acrobat’s Function key shortcuts, you need to open the Mac OS X Preferences and 
reassign the default keys.

106
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat

Toolbars
Open the View ➪ Toolbars menu command and a submenu displays all the toolbars and menu 
options you have when opening a context menu on the Toolbar Well. This menu is just an identical 
repeat for the same items contained in the context menu. To access the complete set of tools and 
options for loading and unloading tools from toolbars, select More Tools at the bottom of either 
menu. Additionally you have options for selecting toolbars from the Tools menu. At the bottom of 
the Tools menu you find the Customize Toolbars command. Selecting this command is the same 
as selecting More Tools in either the View ➪ Toolbars submenu or a context menu opened on the 
Toolbar Well. Any one of the three menu selections opens the More Tools window.
Navigation Tabs
Choose View ➪ Navigation Panels and a submenu displays all the palettes that can be opened as 
floating palettes or docked in the Navigation panel.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For a description of all the Navigation panels, see Chapter 1.
Grid
If you need to examine drawings, a grid may help in your analysis. In Acrobat Professional, you 
can choose to view your file displaying a grid. Grids can be useful when you’re authoring PDF files, 
particularly documents for engineers, architects, and PDF forms. For viewing purposes they can be 
useful where relationships to objects require some careful examination. To show a grid, choose 
View ➪ Grid. By default, the grid displays in the Document pane with blue lines at fixed major and 
minor gridlines, as shown in Figure 5.8.
 FIGURE 5.8
Choose View ➪ Grid or press the CtrlÔ+U to access the grid. You can change the grid lines for major and 
minor divisions in the Preferences dialog box.

107

If you want to change the distances for the major gridlines and the number of divisions for the 
minor gridlines, open the Preferences dialog box and select Units & Guides in the left pane. The 
preference settings enable you to change the units of measure and attributes for the grid layout, as 
shown in Figure 5.9.
 FIGURE 5.9
Preference choices for Units & Guides offer you options for changing the units of measure and the grid 
layout.
The Units & Guides preference settings are also used for changing attributes for the grid layout and 
rulers. The attribute choices include the following:
 Page & Ruler Units. Five choices are available from the pull-down menu. You can choose 
Points, Picas, Millimeters, Centimeters, or Inches. Whatever you choose here is reflected 
in the rulers when you display the rulers (View ➪ Rulers or press Ctrl/Ô+R). Choices here 
also affect the units of measure found in the Info palette discussed in Chapter 1.
 Width between lines. The horizontal distance between the major gridlines is determined 
in the field box for this setting. You can click on the arrows, enter a number between 0.028 
and 138.888 in the field (when inches are selected for the unit of measurement), or press 
the Up or Down Arrow keys to change the values.

108
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
NOTE
NOTE
The limit of 138.888 relates to inches. If you change the units of measure, the limits 
are roughly the same as the 138.888-inch limit. In points, the range measures 
between 2 and 10,000.
 Height between lines. You can change the major gridlines appearing vertically with this 
field. Use the same methods of changing the values here as for the lines for the Width option.
 Grid offset from left edge. Each grid has x and y coordinates indicating where the grid 
begins on a page. You set the x-axis in this field.
 Grid offset from top edge. Use this field to set the starting point of the y-axis.
 Subdivisions. The number of gridlines appearing between the major gridlines is deter-
mined in this field. The acceptable values range between 0 and 10,000 (when units are 
set to points).
 Grid line color. By default, the color for the gridlines is blue. You can change the grid 
color by clicking the color swatch. When you click the blue swatch for Grid line color, a 
pop-up color palette opens, as shown in Figure 5.10. Select a color from the preset color 
choices in the palette or click Other Color. If you click Other Color, the system color pal-
ette opens, in which you can make custom color choices. The Windows and Macintosh 
system color palettes vary slightly, as shown in Figure 5.11.
 FIGURE 5.10
Click the color swatch for the Grid line color to choose from a selection of preset colors, 
or select Other Color to open the system color palette.

 Guide color. Guides are created from ruler wells, and you can manually position them in 
the Document pane. If you have ruler guides and a grid, you’ll want to change one color 
to easily distinguish the guides from the grid. Both default to the same blue. To change 
the guide color, click the Guide Color swatch and follow the same steps as described for 
Grid line color.
Snap to Grid
When you choose View ➪ Snap to Grid, objects you draw snap to the major and minor gridlines. 
This feature can be particularly helpful with form designs and engineering drawings.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on Snap to Grid, see Chapter 34.
Rulers
Acrobat supports viewing rulers, and you can turn them on via the View menu or using the key-
board shortcut Ctrl/Ô+R. When you choose View ➪ Ruler or use the keyboard shortcut, rulers 
appear on the top and left side of the Document pane. Inside the top and left ruler is an inexhaust-
ible supply of guidelines. To add a guideline on the document page, place the cursor within the 
top or left ruler, press the mouse button, and drag away from the ruler in the Document pane. 
Continue adding as many guidelines as you want by returning to the ruler wells and dragging out 
more guidelines.
TIP
TIP
You can also add guidelines by double-clicking a ruler. If you want guides positioned 
at 1-inch increments, as an example, move the mouse cursor to a ruler and double-
click the mouse button on each 1-inch increment. Guidelines appear on the page in the Document 
pane with each double-click of the mouse button. If you attempt to double-click the ruler outside 
the page area, Acrobat sounds a warning beep and a guideline won’t appear outside the docu-
ment page. If you do want a guideline outside the page area, add a guideline within the page 
bounding box and drag the guide outside the page area.
If you want to move a guideline after it has been placed in the Document pane, select the Hand 
tool and place the cursor directly over the guideline to be moved. The cursor changes from a 
hand to a selection arrow. Press the mouse button and drag the line to the desired position.
TIP
TIP
If you have multiple guidelines to draw on a page at equal distances, use the Units 
& Guides preferences and set the major guides to the distance you want between 
the guides. Set the subdivision guidelines to zero. For example, if you want guidelines two inches 
apart, set the major Height and Width guides to 2 inches and enter 0 (zero) in the subdivisions. 
Click OK and you save some time dragging guidelines from ruler wells.
To delete a guideline, click the line and press the Delete key on your keyboard. You can also click 
and drag a guideline off the document page and back to the ruler well to delete it. If you want to 
delete all guides on a page, open a context menu (see Figure 5.12) on a ruler and select Clear 
Guides on Page. If you select Clear All Guides, all guides drawn throughout your document are 
deleted.

110
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat

 FIGURE 5.12
To clear guides on a page or throughout all pages, open a context menu on a ruler and select Clear All 
Guides.
The context menu for rulers also enables you to hide the rulers; you can also use the shortcut keys 
Ctrl/Ô+R or revisit the View menu. Hidden rulers don’t affect the view of the guides that remain 
visible. Notice that the context menu also contains choices for units of measure, which makes 
changing units here much handier than returning to the preference settings mentioned earlier. The 
context menu also offers the option to show and hide guides.

 Formerly labeled Wireframe in Acrobat 7, this item appears in both the View menu and 
 the Page Display toolbar. When you zoom in and out of a drawing, the line weights zoom 
according to the zoom level. For example, a 1-point line zoomed in 400 percent produces a line 
weight view at 4 points. Zooming out reduces the line weight sizes to where lines can appear 
almost invisible. When you click the Line Weights tool or select View ➪ Line Weights, all lines 
appear at a 1-point size regardless of the zoom level.
Automatically Scroll
Automatic scrolling scrolls pages in the open file at a user-defined speed in all Acrobat viewers. 
When you select the command, Acrobat automatically switches the Single Page layout view to 
Single Page Continuous view and Two-Up views to Two-Up Continuous views. The pages in the 
document scroll up, permitting you to read the text without using any keys or the mouse. Attribute 
changes for automatic scrolling include the following:
 Changing scrolling speed. To change the scrolling speed, press a number key from 0 
(being the slowest) to 9 (being the fastest) on your keyboard or press the Up or Down 
Arrow keys to speed up or down in increments.
 Reverse scrolling direction. Press the hyphen or minus key.

Read Out Loud
This command is a marvelous accessibility tool in all Acrobat viewers. You can have Acrobat PDF 
documents read aloud to you without having to purchase additional equipment/software such as 
screen readers. If you want to turn your back on the computer while doing some other activity, 
you can have Acrobat read aloud any open document. For entertainment purposes, you can gather 
the family around the computer and have an eBook read to you.

For information on screen readers, see the sidebar “About Screen Readers” later in 
this chapter.
When you choose View ➪ Read Out Loud, a submenu opens with four menu commands. The menu 
commands all have keyboard shortcuts associated with them, but before you can use the commands 
you must first select Activate Read Out Loud in the submenu. The menu commands then become 
active as you see in Figure 5.13. For pausing and stopping the reading, you may want to remember 
these keyboard shortcuts. The commands include:
 Activate/Deactivate Read Out Loud (Shift+Ctrl/Ô+Y). Select Activate Read Out Loud 
when you start a Read Out Loud session. The menu name then changes to Deactivate 
Read Out Loud. Make this choice to stop reading out loud.
 Read This Page Only (Shift+Ctrl/Ô+V). The current active page in the Document pane 
is read aloud. Reading stops at the end of the target page.
 Read To End of Document (Shift+Ctrl/Ô+B). The reading starts on the active page and 
continues to the end of the document. If you want to start at the beginning of your file, 
click the First Page tool before selecting this menu command.
 Pause/Resume (Shift+Ctrl/Ô+C). After the reading begins, you see the Pause command 
active in the submenu. Select Pause or press the keyboard shortcut keys and Resume appears 
in the menu. Use the same menu command or shortcut to toggle Pause and Resume.
 Stop (Shift+Ctrl/Ô+E). To stop the reading aloud, select the command or use the key-
board shortcut.

Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
You change attribute settings for reading aloud in the Preferences dialog box, which you open by 
choosing Edit ➪ Preferences in Windows, Acrobat ➪ Preferences in Mac OS X, or use the keyboard 
shortcut (Ctrl/Ô+K). In the left pane shown in Figure 5.14, Reading is selected. The Reading pref-
erences are displayed in the right pane (See Figure 5.14). Preference settings include the following:
 Reading Order. Three choices are available from the Reading Order pull-down menu. When 
in doubt, use the default setting to Infer reading order from document (recommended).
 Infer reading order from document (recommended). With this choice Acrobat 
makes some guesses about the order for what items are read on the page. If you have 
multiple columns and the layout is not clearly set up as a page with no layout attri-
butes, the reading order may need some finessing. Acrobat will do its best to deliver 
the reading in an order compliant to the page layout.
 Left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading order. Reading order delivers the reading, 
ignoring any columns or heads that may be divided across a page. This choice might 
be best used for a book designed as text only in a single column.
 Use reading order in raw print stream. Delivers words in the document in the order 
recorded in the print stream.
 Override the reading order in tagged documents. Tagged PDF documents contain 
structural information, and they are designed to be accessible with reading devices so the 
proper reading order conforms to the way one would visually read a file. Tagged PDF 
documents have a designated reading order based on the tree structure. If the PDF docu-
ment is a tagged PDF with a reading structure defined and you want to ignore the order, 
deselect the check box. You might make this choice if the tagged PDF does not accurately 
support the proper reading order and the delivery is more problematic than reading an 
untagged file.
 Page vs. Document. Choices include Only read the current visible pages, Read the entire 
document, or For large documents, only read the currently visible pages. The difference 
between the first and last command is when the last item is selected (For large documents, 
only read the currently visible pages), the field box below the pull-down menu becomes 
active where you can specify the number of pages to be read.
 Confirm before tagging documents. If a document is tagged before reading aloud, a con-
firmation dialog box opens confirming the file is a tagged document. When the option is 
checked you can confirm the options that will be used before Acrobat prepares an untagged 
document for reading. Tagging can be a time-consuming procedure, especially for larger doc-
uments. This preference corresponds to the Confirm Before Tagging Documents option in 
the Accessibility Setup Assistant.
 Volume. You adjust volume settings in the Volume pull-down menu. Choose from 1 to 
10 to lower or raise the volume.
 Use default voice. By default, the Use default voice check box is enabled. If you want 
to change the voice, deselect the check box and open the pull-down menu adjacent to 
Voice. The voice availability depends on voices installed with your operating system. 

113

Your text-to-speech default voice installed with your operating system is used. By default 
you may only have a single voice available. If you want additional voices, consult your 
operating system manual. If no additional voices are installed, you won’t be able to 
change the voice. If you have multiple voices installed, select a voice from the pull-down 
menu.
 Use default speech attributes. The speech attributes are settings for the pitch and the 
speed the voice reads your file. If you want to change the pitch and/or reading rate, dese-
lect the check box. Pitch can be changed to a value between 1 and 10. To completely 
understand what’s going on with the pitch settings, experiment a little and listen to the 
various pitch changes with the voice you select from the Voice pull-down menu. Words 
Per Minute enables you to slow down or speed up the reading. The default is 190 wpm. 
If you want to make a change, type a new value in the field box.
 Read form fields. This setting is designed for use with Acrobat PDF forms. Check the 
box to have form field default values read aloud. If default text is added to a field, the text 
is read aloud. If the default text (or any text added to a text field) is replaced, the content 
of the form fields are read aloud.

Scrolling
Anyone familiar with window environments is no stranger to scrolling. Fortunately, scroll bars 
behave in a standard fashion among computer platforms and various computer programs. Page 
scrolling works the same in an Acrobat viewer as it does in Microsoft Word (or any other Microsoft 
product for that matter), or any illustration, layout, or host of other applications that you may be 
familiar with. Drag the scroll bar up and down or left to right to move the document within the 
active window. Click between the scroll bar at the top or bottom of the scrolling column to jump 
a page segment or full page. The arrow icons at the top, bottom, left, and right sides allow you to 
move in smaller segments in the respective directions.
Acrobat 8 and 9 add a little flair to scrolling. When you drag the elevator bar up and down, you 
get not only the page number and total pages in the file but a thumbnail preview of each page as 
you scroll the pages. Note that the thumbnails only show up when in Single Page or Two-Up mode.
When you drag the scroll bar up or down in a multiple-page PDF file, a small thumbnail appears 
as well as a page number associated with the scroll bar position and the total number of pages in 
the document. (See Figure 5.15.) The readout is in the form of “n of n pages.” The first number 
dynamically changes as you move the scroll bar between pages. This behavior works in all as long 
as you are in Single Page or Two-Up Mode.
About Screen Readers
T
he term screen reader as used in this book refers to specialized software and/or hardware devices 
that enable the reading aloud of computer files. Software such as JAWS and Kurzwiel, and a host 
of other specialized software programs are sold to people with vision and motion challenges for the 
purpose of voice synthesizing and audio output. Many of these devices deliver audio output from 
proprietary formatted files or a select group of software applications. Some screen readers read raster 
image files saved in formats such as TIFF by performing an optical character recognition (OCR) on-
the-fly and reading aloud text as it is interpreted from the image files. This method makes scanning 
pages of books and papers and having the scanned images interpreted by the readers easy.
Because Acrobat has implemented many tools and features for working with accessible files for the 
vision and motion challenged, screen reader developers have been supporting PDF format for some 
time. When a PDF is delivered to a reader and you select Read the entire document, the entire PDF 
file is sent to the reader before the first page is read. If you have long documents, you can choose to 
send a certain number of pages to the screen reader to break up the file into smaller chunks. When 
you select For long documents, read only the currently visible pages and the default of 10 pages is 
selected, ten pages are sent to the screen reader and the reading commences. After the pages are 
read, another ten pages are sent to the screen reader and read aloud, and so on.

Zooming
Zooming in and out of document pages is a fact of life with many different programs. Even when 
you type text in a word processor, you often need to zoom in on text that is set in a style suited for 
printing, but looks horrible at a 100% view on your computer monitor. The same holds true for 
spreadsheets, all imaging and layout programs, and any kind of program where page sizes grow 
beyond a standard letter-size page.
Because Acrobat accommodates a page size of up to 200 × 200 inches, PDF documents sporting 
large page sizes need some industrial-strength zoom tools. Acrobat Professional contains a few 

116
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
more tools than other Acrobat viewers; however, all viewers enable you to zoom in and out of doc-
ument pages using many tools consistent across all the viewers. The Zoom In and Zoom Out tools 
used in all viewers permit views from .33 percent to 6,400 percent of a document page.
Several tools are available for zooming. By default the Marquee Zoom and the Dynamic Zoom tools 
appear in the Select & Zoom toolbar docked in the Toolbar Well. If you load all the zoom tools in 
the Select & Zoom toolbar you can select from one of six zoom tools in Acrobat Professional. Four 
of the six tools are available in all Acrobat 9 viewers.
In all viewers, you can also zoom by clicking the Zoom In or Zoom Out buttons in the Zoom tool-
bar (represented by a + and – symbol) or editing the zoom percentage field in the toolbar — just 
type a new value in the field box and press the Enter/Return key to zoom. When you click the 
down-pointing arrow, the preset pull-down menu opens.
The View menu also has a Zoom To command. Select it and the Zoom To dialog box opens where 
you can select fixed zoom levels from a pull-down menu or type in a value from 0.5 to 6,400 per-
cent. However, this menu command is redundant because you can also use the Zoom toolbar in 
the same manner.
TIP
TIP
At first glance you may think that the menu command is useless and unnecessary. 
However, when viewing PDF documents where the menu bar is hidden or viewing 
files in Full Screen mode, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Ô+M to open the Zoom To dia-
log box. You can then change zoom levels without making the menu bar visible or exiting Full 
Screen mode.
Marquee Zoom tool
 
 By default the Marquee Zoom tool appears in the Select & Zoom toolbar. This toolbar is 
 loaded by default and appears when you open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and 
select Reset Toolbars.
Click the Marquee Zoom tool in the Select & Zoom toolbar and you have several ways you can use 
the tool using modifier keys that include:
 Click and drag. Drag the tool to create a marquee to zoom in to an area.
 Alt/Option+click and drag. Press the Alt/Option key to marquee an area and you zoom 
the page out.
 Click. Click the Marquee Zoom tool and the zoom jumps a fixed percentage.
 Alt/Option+click. Press the Alt/Option key and click and you zoom out at fixed 
percentages.
Zoom In tool
 
 The Zoom In tool is restricted to its fixed position in the Zoom toolbar. Click the Zoom tool in 
 the Zoom toolbar and you zoom in to the same fixed preset zooms as when using the Marquee 
Zoom tool.

117

Zoom Out tool
 
 The Zoom Out tool works in exactly the same way as the Zoom In tool, only it zooms out 
 rather than in. It also has the same options associated with it as are associated with the 
Marquee Zoom tool when you press Alt/Option.
Dynamic Zoom tool
 
 When you first use the Dynamic Zoom tool, you may feel like you’re watching a George 
 Lucas sci-fi movie. It’s downright mesmerizing. This tool is available in all Acrobat viewers 
and is much handier than drawing marquees with the Marquee Zoom tool.
To use dynamic zooming, select the tool from the Select & Zoom toolbar. Click and drag up to 
zoom in and down to zoom out. Stop at the desired zoom level by releasing the mouse button. 
Acrobat displays a proxy view while zooming in and out and only refreshes the screen when you 
release the mouse button. Using this tool, therefore, is much faster because each zoom increment 
does not require a new screen refresh.
TIP
TIP
You can easily toggle between the Marquee Zoom tool and the Dynamic Zoom tool 
using a modifier key. When the Marquee Zoom tool is selected, press the Shift key 
and the tool changes to the Dynamic Zoom tool. Release the Shift key and you return back to the 
Marquee Zoom tool.
Loupe tool
 
 If you use other Adobe programs, such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, or Adobe 
 InDesign, you know about the Navigator palette. The Loupe tool, available in all Acrobat 9 
viewers, works similarly to the Navigator palette found in other Adobe programs but with a little 
twist. Instead of viewing a complete page in the Loupe Tool window, you see just the zoom level 
of your selection while the page zoom remains static. This tool can be a great benefit by saving you 
time to refresh your monitor when you change screen views.
To use the Loupe tool, click in the Select & Zoom toolbar or press Z on your keyboard and then 
Shift+Z to toggle the Marquee Zoom tool, the Dynamic Zoom tool, and the Loupe tool. Move the 
cursor to an area on a page you want to zoom to and click the mouse button. The Loupe tool win-
dow opens and displays the zoomed area you selected, as shown in Figure 5.16.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
When using keyboard shortcuts for accessing tools you need to enable the Use 
single-key accelerators to access tools preference setting. For more information 
on setting preferences for using keyboard shortcuts, see Chapter 1.
You can increase or decrease the magnification of the zoom area by adjusting the slider bar in the 
Loupe window or clicking the minus or plus symbols in the window. Clicking these symbols offers 
you smaller incremental changes than when using the same symbols in the Select & Zoom toolbar. 
If you want the Loupe tool to show a larger portion, you can resize the Loupe Tool dialog box by 
grabbing a corner of the box and dragging.

118
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
 FIGURE 5.16
Click an area in the Document pane with the Loupe tool, and the target area is viewed at a zoom level in 
the Loupe window.
When you click in the Document pane with the Loupe tool, a rectangle appears around the area 
zoomed into the Loupe window (see Figure 5.16). You can place the cursor inside this rectangle 
and move it around the Document pane to view different areas at the same zoom level. As you zoom 
in, the rectangle reduces in size. At some point it would be impractical to select the rectangle on 
the page. If you can’t find it, zoom out a little in the Loupe tool window until you see the rectangle 
on the page. Click and drag it to a new position and you can adjust your zoom.
Notice also in Figure 5.16 the four handles (squares) on the corners of the rectangle marking the 
Loupe tool zoom area. You can drag the handles in or out to zoom in or out, respectively.
If you have oversized documents that take a long time to refresh, using the Loupe tool helps speed 
up your PDF viewing. You can keep the document page in the Document pane at a reduced view 
while using the Loupe tool to examine areas in detail, which won’t necessitate screen refreshes.
TIP
TIP
The Loupe window displays the zoom level on an open document and remains 
fixed to that document until you target a new area. When you have multiple docu-
ments open, you can zoom in on one document and switch views in the Document pane to 
another document; the zoom display in the Loupe tool window remains fixed to the original 
document view. What you wind up with appears as if it’s a picture-in-picture view such as you 
might see on a television set.

Pan & Zoom Window
 
 Whereas the Loupe tool displays the zoom view in its own window and the page in the 
 Document pane remains static, the Pan & Zoom Window works in the opposite manner. 
The zoom level changes on the page in the Document pane while the original page view remains 
static in the Pan & Zoom Window. The zoom area is highlighted with a red rectangle in the Pan & 
Zoom Window. You can change the default red color of the zoom rectangle by opening the Line 
Color pull-down menu in the window and choosing from preset colors or choosing a custom color.
NOTE
NOTE
If you don’t see a red square in the Pan & Zoom Window in the lower-right corner, 
you need to size the window larger to reveal the pull-down menu.
To use the Pan & Zoom Window, select the tool from the Zoom toolbar. The window displays a 
full page with the red rectangle showing the zoom area. If you open the Pan & Zoom Window 
when your PDF page is in Fit Page view, the page and the red rectangle are the same size.
To zoom a view in the Pan & Zoom Window, select one of the four handles on a corner of the 
rectangle and resize the rectangle by dragging in or out to zoom in or out, respectively. The page 
thumbnail view in the Pan & Zoom Window remains the same size while the rectangle is sized, 
as shown in Figure 5.17.
 FIGURE 5.17
The Pan & Zoom Window displays a thumbnail view of the entire document page. The rectangle in the 
window shows the zoom level corresponding to the page zoom view.

120
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
Also contained in the Pan & Zoom Window are navigation buttons. You can establish a zoom view 
and then scroll pages in your document with the page tools in the window. As you do so, the page 
views in the Document pane hold the same zoom level you set in the Pan & Zoom Window. 
Zoom tool behaviors
A few specific differences exist between the Loupe tool and the Pan & Zoom tool that you should 
know. The Loupe tool targets an area on an open document and the zoom is fixed to that docu-
ment while it remains open or until you target a new area. Regardless of the number of files you 
open, the Loupe tool window displaying your target view stays intact even if another document is 
brought to the front of the Document pane. If you close a file where the Loupe tool was set to view 
a zoom, the Loupe tool window clears and displays no view.
The Pan & Zoom tool always shows a target view of the active document brought forward in the 
Document pane. If you have multiple documents open, open the Pan & Zoom tool, then close a 
file, the page in view in the next file appears in the Pan & Zoom Window. If you close all files, the 
Pan & Zoom Window clears.
If you close a file during an Acrobat session, both the Loupe tool and the Pan & Zoom tool return 
you to the same views. The Pan & Zoom tool displays the opening page at the same zoom level as 
was last established in the window. The Loupe tool displays the same view last created with the 
tool. For example, if you zoom to 200% on page 25 of a file, close the file, and then reopen it, the 
Loupe tool window displays page 25 at 200% while the Document pane displays the opening page.
You can use both tools together to display different views in different documents. If the page in 
view in the Loupe window is not the current active document brought forward in the Document 
pane, you can still manage zooming on the hidden page. Use the slider between the minus/plus 
symbols to change zoom levels. In Figure 5.18, you can see the Loupe tool and the Pan & Zoom 
tool used together in different documents. The Loupe tool shows a zoom view on one page in a 
document while the Pan & Zoom tool shows a zoom view on a page in another document.

Changing Page Views
The page views for Actual Size, Fit Width, and Fit Page are static views that you want to access 
frequently when navigating through a PDF document. Acrobat viewers provide several ways to 
change a page view. Three tools appear in the Select & Zoom toolbar for toggling different page 
views. The different views include:
 
  Actual Size. Displays the PDF page at actual size (a 100 % view).
 
  Fit Width. The data on a PDF page are displayed horizontally without clipping. If the 
page is large and data appear only in the center of the page, the page zooms to fit the data. 
The white space at the page edges is ignored.
 
  Fit Page. Displays the page at the maximum size that fits within the viewer Document 
pane. If the Acrobat viewer window is sized up or down, the Fit Page view conforms to 
the size of the Document pane.

122
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
One of the keyboard shortcuts you’ll want to remember is Ctrl/Ô+0 (zero). This enables you to view 
a page in a Fit Page view. As you browse pages in a PDF document, the page views are specific to 
the individual pages and not the document. Therefore, scrolling PDF files with different page sizes 
may require you to frequently change views if you want to see the full page in the Document pane. 
By using the keyboard shortcuts, you can reset page views much faster.
Page views can be established for the opening page according to user-specified zoom views. Setting 
these attributes was referred to as Open Options in earlier versions of Acrobat. In Acrobat 6 and 
later, they are referred to as Initial View. These and other kinds of page views available in Acrobat 
are covered in the following section.
Setting Initial View Attributes
Initial View is the page view you see when you first open a PDF document. You can set several 
different attributes for an opening view and you can save your settings with the document. These 
views are document specific so they only relate to a document where you save the settings. When 
no settings have been saved with a file, the file is saved with a default view.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
To understand more about default views, see “Understanding Initial View prefer-
ences” later in this chapter.
Coincidentally, even though previous versions of Acrobat provided you with options to save an 
initial view, most PDF authors rarely use them. You can find thousands of PDF files on the Internet 
and most of them have no settings enabled for an opening view other than the program defaults. I 
hope that by the time you finish this section, you can see some advantages for saving a particular 
initial view for the PDF documents you create and edit.
To set the attributes for the opening view, choose File ➪ Properties or use the keyboard shortcut 
Ctrl/Ô+D. The Document Properties dialog box opens, displaying a row of tabs at the top. Click 
the Initial View tab as shown in Figure 5.19.
NOTE
NOTE
Initial View settings are not available nor can they be changed in Adobe Reader 
even when usage rights have been added to the PDF. When Initial Views are saved 
from Acrobat Standard, Pro, or Pro Extended, PDFs open with the saved views in all Acrobat 
viewers.

 FIGURE 5.19
To set the attributes for the opening view, choose File ➪ Properties and click the Initial View tab when the 
Document Properties dialog box opens.
Acrobat provides you with many different choices for controlling the initial view of a PDF opened 
in any Acrobat viewer. Settings you make on the Initial View tab can be saved with your document. 
When you establish settings other than defaults, the settings saved with the file override the user’s 
default preference settings. The options on this tab are as follows:
 Layout and Magnification. The default opening page is the first page of a PDF document. 
You can change the opening page to another page and you can control the page layout 
views and magnification by selecting choices from the Layout and Magnification section. 
The choices include:
NOTE
NOTE
One reason you might want to open a PDF document on a page other than the first 
page is when you have a cover page or a title page that doesn’t include content of 
interest to the reader. In such cases, you might want to open the PDF document on page two 
where a contents page or the first page of a section or chapter appears.
 Navigation tab. Five choices are available from the Navigation tab pull-down menu. 
Select Page Only to open the page with the Navigation panel collapsed. Use the 
Bookmarks Panel and Page option to open the Bookmarks panel when the file opens. 
Use the Pages Panel and Page option to open the Pages panel where the thumbnails 
of pages are viewed. Use Attachments Panel and Page to open the Attachments panel 
when the file opens, and use Layers Panel and Page to open the Layers panel when the 
file opens.

124
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
 Page Layout. The default for Page Layout is noted in the pull-down menu as Default. 
When you save a PDF file with the Default selection, the PDF opens according to the 
default value a user has set for page viewing on the user’s computer. To override the 
user’s default, you can set a page layout in the opening view from one of six choices. 
Your options include:
  Single Page. This option opens a single page view that appears the same as when  
 
you click the Single Page layout tool.
  Single Page Continuous. The same as the Continuous page layout view in earlier 
 
versions of Acrobat. This view appears the same as when you click the Single Page 
 
Continuous tool.
  Two-Up (Facing). The Two-Up (Facing) view shows the first two pages in a file 
 
beside each other in a two-page layout. When you scroll, subsequent pages snap 
 
to a page view. This view is the same as clicking the Two-Up tool.
  Two-Up Continuous (Facing). The view appears very similar to Two-Up (Facing) 
 
but when you scroll pages, partial pages can be viewed in the Document pane. For 
 
example, the bottom of the previous page and the top of the next page may appear. 
 
In other words, this view doesn’t snap pages to fit in the Document pane.
  Two-Up (Cover Page). The initial view shows one page as in the Single Page 
 
view. When you scroll pages, however, the subsequent pages are displayed in a 
 
Two-Up (facing pages) view.
  Two-Up Continuous (Cover Page). The initial page opens on the right side of 
 
the Document pane in a Single Page view. When you scroll pages, the scrolling is 
 
similar to the Two-Up Continuous view where facing pages are shown.
  Magnification. Choose from preset magnification views in the pull-down menu. 
 
If you want the PDF document to open in a fit-in-window view, select Fit Page. 
 
Choose from other magnification options or edit the text box for a custom-zoom 
 
level. If Default is selected, the document opens according to user preference 
 
magnification settings.
  Open to page. You can change the opening page to another page by entering a 
 
number in the Page number text box. This setting might be used if you want a 
 
user to see a contents page on page 2 in a document instead of a title page that 
 
appears on page 1.
 Window Options. The default window for Acrobat is a full screen where the viewing 
area is maximized to occupy your monitor surface area. You can change the window view 
to size down the window to the initial page size, center a smaller window onscreen, and 
open a file in Full Screen mode. If you enable all three check boxes, the Full Screen mode 
prevails.
 Show. From the pull-down menu choose either File Name or Document Title. If you 
select File Name, the title bar at the top of the Acrobat window shows the filename. If 
Document Title is used, the information you supply in the Document Properties dialog 
box for Document Title is shown in the title bar.

Document titles are very important when you’re archiving volumes of PDFs and cre-
ating search indexes. For information on creating document titles and how they are 
used, see Chapter 6.
 User Interface Options. The Interface Options in the Initial View Document Properties 
dialog box have to do with user interface items in Acrobat viewers, such as menu bars, 
toolbars, and scroll bars. You can elect to hide these items when the PDF document opens 
in any Acrobat viewer. In Acrobat 9, you can hide only two of the three options for the 
User Interface Controls shown in Figure 5.19. You can choose to hide the menu bar and 
the window controls as shown in Figure 5.20, the menu bar and the toolbars, or ay one 
of the single items. Acrobat 9 doesn’t permit you to hide all three options
 
The window controls you see in Figure 5.21 include the scroll bars, the status bar, and 
the Navigation panel. If you hide the toolbars and menu bar but elect to leave the win-
dow controls visible, users can access tools for page navigation.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
If you elect to eliminate the toolbars and menu bar from view and later want to go 
back and edit your file, you need to use shortcut keys to get the menu bars and 
toolbars back. Be certain to remember the F9 key — F9 shows and hides the menu bar and the 
F8 key that shows/hides toolbars.
 FIGURE 5.20
When toolbars and the menu bar are hidden, navigating pages requires keyboard short-
cuts or navigational buttons on the pages.

If you open a PDF document with Window Controls hidden, you can open the 
Navigation pane by opening a context menu on the far left side of the Document 
pane and choosing Show Navigation Panel Buttons.
Setting custom zoom levels
The Initial View options for the page zoom are at fixed magnification levels. If you want a PDF 
document to open at a zoom level of 69%, for example, you don’t have the choice for this custom 
zoom option in the Initial View settings. To set a custom zoom level, you need to use a JavaScript. 
To add a JavaScript to open a PDF document at a custom zoom level, do the following:
Steps: Setting Custom Zoom Magnification with JavaScript
 
1. Open a document and choose Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Document 
JavaScripts. The JavaScript Functions dialog box opens.
 
2. Type a name for the script in the Script Name text box. In my example, I’ll name my 
script: zoom.
 
3. Click Add to open the JavaScript Editor.

4. Delete the default text in the JavaScript Editor window and type the following code:
this.zoom=69;
 
5. Click OK in the JavaScript Editor to return to the JavaScript Functions dialog box 
as shown in Figure 5.22.
 
6. Close in the JavaScript Functions dialog box.
 
7. Save the file.
 FIGURE 5.22

The above code forces the PDF document to open at 69%. If you want to use another magnification, 
just change 69 to another numeric value in the script.

Understanding Initial View preferences
If you don’t assign Initial View attributes in the Document Properties dialog box and save the file 
to update it, initial views are determined from individual user preferences. Because each user can 
set preferences differently, the same PDF may appear with a different page layout mode and a dif-
ferent zoom level on different computers. Depending on the design of your documents and how 
you want them viewed by end users, potential inconsistency in document views might make view-
ing difficult for those who view your files.

128
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
Users set initial view preferences in the Preferences dialog box. Open the Preferences dialog box 
by pressing Ctrl/Ô+K, and then click Page Display in the left pane. At the top of the right pane, a 
pull-down menu appears for Default page layout; at the bottom of the right pane another menu 
appears for Default zoom. You can select different page layout and default zoom views from the 
menus. In Figure 5.23, the Default page layout view is set to Single Page and the Default zoom is set 
to Fit Page. When you click OK to accept these changes, all PDF documents that have initial views 
set to Default will open on your computer with the views derived from your preference choices. 
Other users may choose different options from the pull-down menus, thereby displaying PDF docu-
ments with default views according to the choices they make in the Page Display preferences.
Be aware that the initial views you set in a PDF file from the Document Properties override the user 
preferences in the Page Display preferences pane. Therefore, you can control the initial views for 
all the PDFs you create. Doing so means your documents are viewed consistently across all com-
puters regardless of the differences between individual user preference choices.
 FIGURE 5.23
Changing the Default page layout to Single Page and the Default zoom to Fit Page opens all PDFs saved 
with default initial views with your new preference settings.
Saving the Initial View
When you decide what view attributes you want assigned to your document, you can choose one 
of two save options. The first option updates the file. Click the Save tool in the Acrobat File toolbar 
or choose File ➪ Save. Any edits you make in the Initial View properties activates the Save com-
mand. The Save command is inactive and grayed out by default until you make any changes to 
your file or reset any kind of preferences that can be saved with the document. The other option is 
to use Save As. When you select File ➪ Save As, you completely rewrite the file when you click the 
Save button in the Save As dialog box.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
You have different choices for saving files using either Save, Save As, or Save a 
Version a version. For a more complete understanding of saving, updating, and 
saving versions of PDFs, see Chapter 11.

Viewing Files with the Window Menu
If you open a PDF file and then open a second PDF, the second file hides the first document. If 
several PDFs are opened, the last opened document hides all the others. Fortunately, the Acrobat 
viewers have made it easy for you to choose a given document from a nest of open files.
When you load an Acrobat viewer with several open files, you can use tools to help you manage 
them. If you need to visually compare documents, several different viewing options are available.
The Window menu contains options for helping you manage document views, and in particular, 
multiple documents. The options you find in the Window menu won’t be found with tools or in 
the status bar, so you’ll find yourself visiting this menu frequently if you work with multiple open 
files in Acrobat or if you need to create more than one view in the same document.
Minimize and zoom views
By default, when you open PDF files, the Acrobat window appears minimized. In other words, the 
application window doesn’t zoom to the full screen size. This behavior can be a blessing for those 
with large monitors who want to work in Acrobat and another application alongside the Acrobat 
window, or a curse for those who want to take advantage of a full screen size when working in 
Acrobat alone.
 
 If you leave the preferences at the default, you can zoom the Acrobat application window by 
 clicking the features button on the application window. Click the Maximize button repre-
sented by an X in the top-right corner (Windows) and the window zooms to a maximized view.
 
 On the Macintosh, click the plus icon in the top-left corner of the application window and 
 the application window zooms to a maximized view.
New Window
New Window was a new feature in Acrobat 7 Professional. When you open a document and select 
New Window, a duplicate view of your existing document is opened in the Document pane. You 
can change views and pages in one window while viewing different page views in another window. 
This feature is handy for viewing a table of contents in one window while viewing content on other 
pages in the same file.
When you select New Window, Acrobat adds an extension to the filename in the title bar. If you 
have a document open in Acrobat with a filename like Employee Application and then select New 
Window, the title bar displays Employee Application:1 on one view and Employee Application:2 
on the second view.
New Window can be particularly helpful when viewing PDF Portfolios. You can create a PDF 
Portfolio and view two or more files within the package in new windows and tiled views.

130
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on PDF Portfolios and viewing options you have with these 
files, see Chapter 12. For more on tiling views, see “Tile” later in this chapter.
Cascade
If you have several files open and choose Window ➪ Cascade, the open files appear in a cascading 
view with the title bars visible much like you might view cascading Web pages. You can see the 
name of each file and easily select from any one shown in the Document pane. Click a title bar to 
bring a document forward.
After bringing a file forward, if you want to see the title bars in a cascading view again, choose 
Window ➪ Cascade again. The document currently selected in the foreground will appear first 
when you use this command.
The Window menu also lists the open files by filename at the bottom of the window. When you 
have multiple files open, the files are numbered according to the order in which they were opened, 
with the filename appearing in the list, as shown in Figure 5.24. Select any filename from the list in 
the Window menu to bring the file forward in the Document pane.
 FIGURE 5.24
Acrobat lists all open files in the Window menu. To bring a document forward in the Document pane, 
choose the name of the file you want to view from the Window menu.
Tile
You can also choose to have your documents tiled horizontally or vertically via the Tile submenu 
in the Window menu. When you choose Window ➪ Tile ➪ Horizontally or Vertically, the PDF files 
appear in individual windows arranged to fit within the Acrobat window in either a horizontal 
or vertical view. If you have more than three documents open at one time, the display for Tile 
Horizontally and Tile Vertically appear identical. With any number of documents displayed in tiled 
views, the Navigation panel is accessible for each document. Also, when you choose Window ➪ 
New Window and open a second view of the same document, and then tile the views, each win-
dow appears in the tiled documents. In Figure 5.25, two documents appear in a vertical tiled view.

mation on comparing documents, see Chapter 20.
Split
Choose Window ➪ Split and the Document pane splits into two horizontal views of the active doc-
ument, similar to the way you might see a split view in a word processing or spreadsheet program. 
The two views are independent of each other and offer you much flexibility. You can view the 
same page in two different zoom views or you can view two different pages at the same zoom level 
or different zoom views. You can view one pane in a Single page layout and the other pane in one 
of the other page layout options. You can also combine the Split and Tile option to view two or 
more documents, each with split views tiled horizontally or vertically. You can adjust the window 
division by moving the horizontal bar up or down, thereby showing a larger view in one pane and 
a smaller view in the other pane.

132
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
Spreadsheet Split
Spreadsheet Split is the same concept as using a Split view except you now have four panes. Just 
choose Window ➪ Spreadsheet Split. Click inside the pane whose view you want to change and 
then zoom in and out and navigate pages as needed. Move the divider bars horizontally and verti-
cally to size the panes to accommodate your viewing needs. Position the cursor at the intersection 
of the separator bars and you can move the bars vertically and horizontally together.
To remove the Spreadsheet Split view, return to the Window menu and select Spreadsheet Split 
again. The Document pane returns to the default view.
TIP
TIP
You can exit the Spreadsheet view by double-clicking the intersection of the cross-
bars. If you want a split view vertically or horizontally, double-click the vertical (or 
horizontal) crossbar.
Full Screen Mode
Another viewing option found in the Window menu is the Full Screen Mode. Full Screen Mode 
displays your PDF document like a slide show and temporarily hides the menus, toolbars, and 
window controls. You can set up the Full Screen Mode for automatic page scrolling and then walk 
away from the computer — you’ll have a self-running kiosk. You can give a presentation and auto-
matically scroll pages or set preferences for pausing between slides.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
There’s a lot to Full Screen viewing. To learn more about working with Full Screen 
views, see Chapter 28.
Viewing Links
For the purpose of discussion, links in Acrobat are hot spots where you click somewhere in the 
Acrobat window and some action takes place. With regard to viewing PDF documents, clicking 
the mouse button on a link takes you to another view, opens a document or Web page, or executes 
some sort of action. Links can be any one of a number of items, including elements on a PDF page 
such as buttons, articles, fields, and so on, or they can be part of the user interface such as thumb-
nails and links you create from options in palettes. In this chapter, I stick to link behavior in 
Acrobat as it relates to page viewing and locating links.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on creating links and buttons that execute a variety of different 
actions, see Chapter 22.
Navigation pane
The Navigation pane contains the default panels discussed in Chapter 1. Most of these panels are 
connected to certain capabilities for linking to views and other kinds of actions that can be invoked 
with the click of a mouse button. In some cases, a single click takes you to another view and in

For information on creating form fields, see Chapters 33 and 34.
NOTE
NOTE
Having the document page size appear by default without having to move the cur-
sor in the lower left corner of the Acrobat window is a matter of personal choice. I 
find it helpful having the page size reported when I’m opening PDF documents. As a matter of 
consistency in viewing the screen shots in this book, I have this preference option turned on for 
all the figures in the remaining chapters of this book.
 Layers. The Layers panel shows all Adobe PDF layers contained in a document by layer 
names. If the panel is empty, no layers are contained in the file. You use the Layers panel 
to show and hide layers, set layer properties, and manage layers.

from within the Tags panel to locate a tagged element. Whereas the Contents panel identi-
fies all the page content in any PDF file, the Tags panel only shows the structure and ele-
ments of tagged PDF files. Together with the Order panel, Tags are used with accessible 
documents.

Hypertext links
In an Acrobat viewer, hypertext references enable you to move around the PDF or many PDFs, much 
like surfing the Net. You’ve probably become so accustomed to clicking buttons on your desktop 
computer that link navigation is commonplace and needs little instruction. While invoking the 
action is nothing more than a click with the mouse, what it can do in Acrobat is simply remarkable. 
To help you gain an understanding of how Acrobat has employed hyperlinks, the following sections 
describe all the link actions as they can be created in Acrobat and executed in any viewer.
Hypertext references, or buttons, are easily identified in a PDF document. As you move the mouse 
cursor around the document window, a Hand icon with the forefinger pointing appears when you 
position the cursor over a button or a link. You click, and presto! — the link action is executed!
Link actions can be assigned to any one of several items in Acrobat. You can set a link action to 
links, fields, Bookmarks, and Page Actions. The action types available in Acrobat include:
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
All the Link Action types are available with all Acrobat products (Std, Pro, Pro 
Extended). Form fields can be created with all versions in version 9. Earlier versions 
of Acrobat Standard did support creating form fields.
 Execute a menu command. This action links to commands found in the Acrobat menus. 
Unfortunately, many of the Execute a menu command options were removed in Acrobat 
8. If you used some Execute menu items that are no longer available in Acrobat 8 and 9, 
you now have to turn to JavaScript programming and completely rework your files.
 Go to a 3D/Multimedia view. For PDF documents supporting 3D views, you can set an 
action to a specific 3D view.

137
Viewing and Navigating PDF Files

 Go to a page view. The Go to a page view action opens another view on the existing 
page, a view to another page in the same document, a view to a named destination, or a 
view in another document.
 Import form data. This action imports data exported from other forms into the active 
document where form field names match those from where the data were exported.
 Open a file. The Open a file link opens any kind of document. PDFs open in Acrobat. 
Other file types require having the authoring program installed on your computer. For 
example, if the link is to a Microsoft Word document, you need Word installed on your 
computer to open the link.
 Open a web link. Opens a URL in your default Web browser.
 Play a sound. Plays a sound imported into the active PDF.
 Play Media (Acrobat 5 Compatible). Plays a movie file saved in formats compatible 
with Acrobat 5 and lower viewers. Note: Acrobat 5 compatible media cannot be embed-
ded in a PDF document.
 Play Media (Acrobat 6 and Later Compatible). Plays movie files saved in newer formats 
compatible with Acrobat 6 through Acrobat 9, and movie clips can be embedded in PDFs 
using this compatibility. This choice uses legacy methodology and requires the user to 
have a media player installed on their computer.
 Read an article. This action navigates to the specified article in the open PDF document 
or another PDF document.
 Reset a form. All the fields or user-specified fields on a form are cleared of data.
 Run a JavaScript. Executes JavaScripts written in Acrobat.
 Set layer visibility. This action can be set to either hide or show a layer.
 Show/hide a field. With form fields, fields are hidden or made visible on a page.
 Submit a form. This action is used for submitting data in user-prescribed formats to a 
specified URL.
The preceding list is a brief description of action types that can be associated with tools that sup-
port link actions.

For more detail on how to create link actions and a host of attributes you can assign 
to them, see Part IV, “PDF Interactivity” and Part VI, “Acrobat PDF Forms.”
Opening PDF Files
As with most computer programs you already use on either Windows or the Macintosh, you know 
that files are generally opened via the File ➪ Open command. In many programs, the keyboard 
shortcut used to open files is Ctrl/Ô+O. Acrobat uses the same menu and keyboard shortcuts to 
access the Open dialog box where you browse your hard drive, open folders, and ultimately select 

138
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
a file to open. When you double-click a filename or click the Open button when a file is selected, 
the file opens in Acrobat.
 
 All Acrobat viewers also offer you a tool to open files. Click the Open tool in the File toolbar and 
the Open dialog box appears just as if you had used the Open menu command or keyboard short-
cut. Any one of these methods opens a PDF document or a document of one of many different file 
types that can be converted to PDF on-the-fly while you work in Acrobat.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information related to opening files that are converted to PDF with the Open 
command, see Chapter 7.
Opening recently viewed files
When you launch Acrobat and view and/or edit PDF documents, Acrobat keeps track of the most 
recently opened files. By default, Acrobat keeps track of the last five files you opened. In the Startup 
preferences you can change the value to as many as ten recently viewed files. The files are accessible 
at the bottom of the File menu (Windows) or the File ➪ Open Recent File submenu on the Macintosh. 
In Figure 5.27, you can see five filenames at the bottom of the File menu from Acrobat running 
under Windows.
 FIGURE 5.27
The most recently viewed files appear in the File menu (Windows) or File ➪ Open Recent File submenu 
(Macintosh).
You have another option for viewing files that were previously opened in an Acrobat session. As 
shown in Figure 5.27, the History menu command appearing over the recent file list offers you 
submenus for viewing files from a history as long as the previous 12 months. Until you clear the 
History by selecting the Clear History menu command, all the files you viewed over the last 12 
months are displayed in a scrollable list. You can break down the history according to the files 
viewed Today, Yesterday, the Last 7 Days, the Last 14 Days, and the Last 30 Days, as well as the 
Last 12 Months.
Macintosh users can find the History submenu command appearing at the top of the list of files 
when you choose File ➪ Open Recent File.

Using the Organizer
 
 The Organizer is a tool similar in some respects to Adobe Bridge, available in CS3 (or something). 
Although not all features within Adobe Bridge are available in Acrobat’s Organizer, it has many 
impressive tools and commands that help you manage and access documents from within Acrobat. 
To open the Organizer, choose File ➪ Organizer ➪ Open Organizer, click the Organizer tool in the 
File toolbar, or press Shift+Ctrl/Ô+1. (You can also choose File ➪ History ➪ Open Organizer or 
press Shift+Ctrl/Ô+1.) When you select any of the options, the Organizer, shown in Figure 5.28, 
opens.
 FIGURE 5.28
Click the Organizer tool or select Open Organizer from a menu command to open the Organizer window 
in Acrobat.
The Organizer window contains three panes, a number of tools, and menu commands that 
you select from context menus. When you first open the Organizer, you find three panes in the 
Organizer window divided by two separator bars. On the left side of the window is the Categories 
pane. In the center, you find the Files pane and the right side holds the Pages pane. You can adjust 
the size of the panes by clicking a separator bar and dragging it to the left or right. As one pane is 
sized down, the adjacent pane is sized up. You can adjust the size of the Organizer window by 
dragging the lower-right corner of the window.
Using the Categories pane
The Categories pane in the Organizer contains three types of categories. At the top of the pane is 
History followed by My Computer (Windows) or Macintosh HD (Macintosh) and at the bottom 
you find Collections. The History category offers you the same choices for viewing history as you 

140
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
find in the File menu in Windows as described in the earlier section “Opening recently viewed 
files.” As you click one of the History options, the files listed in the Files pane reflect the history 
period you choose.
The My Computer/Macintosh HD category shows you a view of your hard drive and all servers and 
drives connected to your computer, similar to a Windows Explorer view or a Macintosh Finder 
view. You can select a folder, and all PDFs within that folder are listed in the Files pane regardless 
of whether they appear in the view history. Below your accessible hard drives and servers you find 
Favorite Places. If you keep documents within folders you frequently access, right-click (Windows) 
or Control+click (Macintosh) to open a context menu over Favorite Places or click the Add Favorite 
Place button at the bottom of the Categories pane. (See Figure 5.29.)
The Browse For Folder dialog box opens (Windows) or the Select a folder to add to your favorite 
places dialog box opens on the Macintosh after clicking the Add to favorite place button. Adding 
Favorites in this fashion is similar to adding Favorites in your Web browser.
After you select a folder and click OK, the folder you selected appears at the bottom of the Favorite 
Places list.
 FIGURE 5.29
Click the Add a favorite place button to add to the Favorite Places.
The Collections category works similarly to Favorite Places, except that instead of adding folders to 
a list, you can select individual files and add them to a collection. You can add files to collections 
from different folders on your hard drive. By default, Acrobat offers you three collections — 
Collection 1, Collection 2, and Collection 3.
You manage collections through the use of a context menu. Open a context menu from any collec-
tion name in the Collections category and the menu options appear as shown in Figure 5.30.
 FIGURE 5.30
To manage collections, open a context menu on any collection name.

141

The menu selections should be self-explanatory. Click Create a New Collection to add another 
collection to the list. Click Rename Collection to rename a collection. Click Delete Collection to 
remove the collection. Click Add Files to add documents to your collection. After you add docu-
ments to a collection and click the collection name, all files added to the collection appear in the 
Files pane.
TIP
TIP
After installing Acrobat you may want to rename the default collection names to 
more descriptive names used in your workflow. Open a context menu on each col-
lection name and select Rename Collection. The collection name is highlighted and ready for 
you to type a new name.
Using the Files pane
The Files pane contains a list of all files derived from the choice you made in the Categories pane. 
For example, click a History category, and all files viewed within the selected history timeframe 
appear in a list sorted by metadata that you select from the Sort by pull-down menu. In addition 
to the file list you have tools at the top of the pane and context menu commands when opening a 
context menu on a file in the list.
Beginning with the tools at the top of the pane, you find the following:
 Open. By default, the first file in the pane is selected. Click the Open tool to open the 
selected file. If no file is selected in the pane, the Open tool, as well as all other tools, is 
grayed out. A condition where you might not have a file selected is when you click a col-
lection that contains no file in the collection folder or when viewing a folder that contains 
no PDF documents. Otherwise, the first file, by default, is always selected when files are 
shown in the list.
 Print. Click a file in the list and click the Print tool to print the file. When you click Print, 
the PDF document opens and the Print dialog box opens in the foreground. Make your 
print attribute choices in the Print dialog box and click Print to print the file.
 Email. Select a file in the list and click the Email tool, and your default email application 
opens with the selected file attached to a new email message.
 Combine Files. Click this tool to open the Combine files wizard. In the wizard window 
you can select PDF documents to combine into a single file or select a variety of different 
file formats that can be converted to a PDF. The tool works the same as selecting the 
Create PDF Portfolio tool in the Tasks toolbar.

Below the tools is a pull-down menu used for sorting files. Files can be sorted on metadata con-
tained within the file. From the pull-down menu you have several choices for sorting files.
Sorting by Filename is the default and lists files in an alphabetical ascending order. The Title, Subject, 
Author, and Keywords items are part of the Document Properties Description that you supply at 
the time of PDF creation from some authoring programs or that you later add in Acrobat. Creator 
and Producer are part of the Document Description supplied by Acrobat and relate to the original 
authoring program and the application producing the PDF file. Number of Pages, File Size, and 
Modified Date are data that Acrobat adds to the Document Properties derived from the structure of 
the file. The Last Opened Date sorts the files according to the last time you viewed them in Acrobat 
with the most recent file listed first and in descending order.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
To learn more about Document Descriptions and Document Properties, see 
Chapter 6.
You can also manage files from a context menu opened on a file in the list. This menu has com-
mands to perform the same tasks handled by the tools at the top of the pane. In Figure 5.31 you 
can see the top portion of the menu, duplicating the tools’ functions, such as Open, Print, Email, 
Combine Files, and Send for Review.
 FIGURE 5.31
Open a context menu on a file listed in the Files pane and the menu options offer additional commands 
for managing files.
The Add to Collection menu item contains a submenu that lists all the collections in the Categories 
pane. As you add new collections to the Categories, they dynamically appear in the Add to Collection 
submenu. After you add a file to a collection, the context menu changes and displays a few more 
menu commands. Figure 5.31 shows the Move to Collection and Remove from ‘Collection name’ 
commands. The item within the single quotes denotes the collection name where a file has been 
added.
Select Move to Collection and the submenu displays all your collection names. Select a collection 
and the file is moved to the collection you choose in the submenu. Select Remove from ‘n’ (where 
n represents the name of a collection) and a dialog box opens prompting you to confirm the dele-
tion. When you delete a file from a collection, the file is deleted from the collection list but is not 
deleted from your hard drive.

The last menu item, Show in Explorer (Windows) or Show in Finder (Macintosh), takes you to 
Windows Explorer (Windows) or switches to Finder view (Macintosh) and opens the folder where 
the file is located.
Using the Pages pane
One of the great features of the Organizer is that it shows multiple pages in the Pages pane for all 
files containing more than one page. When you select a multipage document, all pages are displayed 
in thumbnail view in the Pages pane before you open the file. At the bottom of the pane is a zoom 
slider. Drag the slider left to display smaller thumbnails and to the right to make the thumbnail 
views larger. The minus and plus buttons display thumbnails smaller and larger, respectively, in 
zoom increments.
As you view multipage documents in the Pages pane, you can double-click any page thumbnail to 
open the respective page in Acrobat. Select a page thumbnail and open a context menu, and a sin-
gle menu command appears, enabling you to open that page.
Another nice feature in the Pages pane is the display of a Document Status icon that appears 
when you save files that have a special status or special feature. Such features might include a 
document saved with layers, a file in a commenting review, or a certified document. In addition 
to the Document Status icon, some files may display a security key representing files that have 
been password secured.
Bookmarking Web-hosted PDFs
As I explain in Chapter 27, Acrobat is well integrated with many different Web services and sup-
port. The Organizer is no exception when it comes to supporting Web-related services. You can 
add anything you can view in Acrobat as a PDF document to your Organizer. When you add a 
document to a collection from a Web-hosted PDF, the link is made to where the file is hosted. In 
this particular case, it’s a link to a URL that you can create as easily as adding files from your hard 
drive to your collections.
The first step is to view a PDF document as an inline view in a Web browser. Both Apple Safari 
and Microsoft Internet Explorer are supported. When you view a PDF in a Web browser, many 
Acrobat tools appear below your browser’s tools. In Figure 5.32, you can see the Organizer tool in 
the top-left corner of the Acrobat window inside Apple’s Safari Web browser. When you click the 
Organizer tool, the Add to Favorites dialog box opens. Click a collection and click OK to add the 
link to your collection.

Click the Organizer tool inside a Web browser to add the URL link to a collection.
When you return to Acrobat, you can view the URL link in the respective collection. Open the 
Organizer and click the collection name where you added the link. In the Files pane you see all 
documents added to the collection. Those files added from Web URLs appear with a different icon 
than standard PDF documents and the content of the page is not shown for these links, as you can 
see in Figure 5.33. You can add files from PDFs on your hard drive and view them from within a 
Web browser (something you might do when working with browser-based reviews), or from URL 
addresses on the Web. In the Files pane adjacent to the document icon, you see the URL address 
from where the document was retrieved.

Summary
This chapter offers you a brief overview of how to go about moving around PDF documents, using 
viewing tools, panels, and pages, as well as opening and managing files. As you can see, the list is 
long and there’s quite a bit to understand in regard to viewing, navigating, opening, and managing 
files. Some of the more important points include the following:
 Page navigation tools are available in a toolbar not visible by default. You can place the 
toolbar in view and dock it to the left, right, top, or below the Document pane for easy 
access to navigation tools.
 The Reading mode feature optimizes your views for page content. You can easily scroll 
pages back and forth with simple mouse clicks.
 PDFs can be read aloud and pages can be autoscrolled without the need for any special 
equipment.
 PDF pages can be viewed in several different layout modes, with grids, guides, and rulers.
 Acrobat contains six tools used for zooming views. The Marquee Zoom tool is a new tool 
in Acrobat permitting you to zoom in and out by drawing marquee selections. In addition 
to the Marquee Zoom, Zoom In, Zoom Out, Dynamic Zoom, the Loupe tool, and the Pan 
& Zoom are available in all Acrobat viewers.
 Initial Views of PDF documents can be displayed with pages and palettes, at different zoom 
levels, with or without menus, tools, and window controls. These settings are document 
specific and can be saved with different options for different documents. The settings are 
established in the Initial View document properties dialog box.
 Links are built into many different Acrobat tools and they can be assigned to items created 
in Acrobat. Different action types can be assigned to many tools and object elements.
 Acrobat 8 and 9 do not support most of the Execute a menu item commands found in all 
earlier versions of Acrobat.
 Links can be made to Web pages and URLs.

146
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
 PDF files are opened through menu commands or by using the Open tool. The most 
recently opened files are listed in the File menu (Windows) or the File ➪ Open Recent 
File submenu (Macintosh).
 The Organizer introduced in Acrobat 7 helps you manage files and access a file history of 
documents opened in Acrobat up to the previous 12 months. The Organizer enables you 
to view page thumbnails of PDF document pages before you open files and can be sorted 
on metadata, added to collections, and added to a Favorite Places list.
 You can add PDFs hosted on Web sites to collections in the Organizer.

A
crobat 9 continues with the search options you had available with 
Acrobat 8. You’ll notice the Find tool and the Search pane are both 
present in this release.
You can find information contained in PDF documents with the Find tool 
for open documents. The Search window is available when a document is 
open in the Document pane or when no document is open. The Search win-
dow enables you to search PDFs scattered around your hard drive without 
the assistance of a search index. However, creating index files with Acrobat 
Catalog and searching the resultant index files is available to you for more 
feature-rich and faster searches. In this chapter, I cover all the tools and fea-
tures available in Acrobat viewers for searching through PDF files and creat-
ing and searching index files.
All four Acrobat viewers (Adobe Reader, Adobe Acrobat Standard, Adobe 
Acrobat Pro, and Adobe Acrobat Pro Extended) support the exact same fea-
tures for searching PDF content.
Setting Up the Work Environment
The Find toolbar is loaded by default when you open Acrobat. There’s no 
real need to open the toolbar in the More Tools window if the toolbar is 
not present in the Toolbar Well. The toolbar automatically opens when you 
select a menu command or keyboard shortcut to use the Find feature. The 
Search window opens from a menu command; therefore, no special tool 
arrangement is needed when searching PDF documents.

Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
For searching PDF documents you may want to load the Search tool. By default the tool is not 
loaded in the File toolbar. Open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and select More Tools. In 
the More Tools window, scroll down the File toolbar and check the box adjacent to the Search 
tool. Click OK and the Search tool is loaded in the File toolbar.
If you intend to engage in editing sessions, comment and review, printing files, and so on, your 
tool arrangement should reflect your editing ambitions. For this chapter, I load the Edit toolbar 
and leave the other tools at the default.
Using the Find Toolbar
In order to use the Find toolbar, you must have a document open in the Document pane. If you 
have more than one document open, you can search only the active document appearing in the 
foreground.
Finding words in an open document can be handled in the Find toolbar. If the toolbar is not loaded 
in the Toolbar Well, select Edit ➪ Find or press Ctrl/Ô+F. The toolbar then opens as a floating 
toolbar.
Type a word in the field box in the Find toolbar and press the Enter/Return key. Acrobat searches 
the current active document and highlights the first occurrence of the found word. When a word 
is found, the Previous and Next buttons in the toolbar become active, as shown in Figure 6.1.
 FIGURE 6.1
Enter the word(s) to be searched in the Find toolbar and press Enter/Return. The Previous and Next buttons 
appear in the toolbar.
Click the Next button in the toolbar, and Acrobat searches for the next occurrence and stops on 
the page where the word is highlighted again. Clicking Previous takes you to the last found word 
in the open document (if you click the button after the first search). When you click Next, and 
then click the Previous button, the search takes you to the previous found word. For example, if 
you search for a word in a 100-page document and the word appears on pages 5, 6, and 99, the 
first time you execute the Find, you stop at page 5. Clicking the Previous button takes you to page 
99. However, if you click Next while on page 5, the next found word appears on page 6. Clicking 
Previous on page 6 takes you back to page 5.
The Find toolbar also includes a pull-down menu, as shown in Figure 6.2, containing several 
menu commands to assist you in narrowing your search.

149

 FIGURE 6.2
Open the pull-down menu in the Find toolbar for more search options.
Click the down-pointing arrow to see the following menu commands:
n Find Next in Current PDF. The menu command finds the next occurrence of the found 
word just as it does when clicking the Find Next tool.
n Open Full Acrobat Search. Opens the Search window. This command performs the 
same function as clicking the Search tool or pressing the Ctrl/Ô+Shift+F keys.
n Whole words only. Returns words that match whole words only. For example, if you 
search for a word like cat, this command avoids returning words such as catalog, catastro-
phe, category, and so on.
n Case-Sensitive. Finds words that match the letter case of the word typed in the Find 
toolbar.
n Include Bookmarks. Finds words in bookmark descriptions.
n Include Comments. Finds words in comment notes.
You can choose one or any combination of the first four options to perform your search. For exam-
ple, you can select Whole words only, Case-Sensitive, Include Bookmarks, and Include Comments, 
and Acrobat returns the first occurrence of only whole words matching the letter case in the search 
criteria whether it be in a bookmark, comment note, or on a document page.
Using the Find toolbar also makes active two other menu commands. After invoking a find, the 
Next Result and Previous Result commands appear active in the Edit ➪ Search Results submenu. 
These commands are the same as using the buttons in the Find toolbar. They also are accompanied 
by keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Ô+G for Next Result and Ctrl/Ô+Shift+G for Previous Result. Note that 
the other two options in the submenu (Next Document and Previous Document) are grayed out 
when you use the Find toolbar. These commands are active only when you use the Search window.
Using the Search Window
You perform searches by accessing a menu command, clicking the Search tool, or by using short-
cut keys. To search from the menu, choose Edit ➪ Search, or open a context menu with the Hand 
tool and select Search. Click the Search tool in the File toolbar and the Search window opens. To

use the keyboard shortcut, press Ctrl/Ô+Shift+F and likewise the Search window opens as shown 
in Figure 6.3. These all allow you to search for a word in an open document, in a collection of 
PDF files stored on your hard drive, or any type of external media. When you invoke a search, the 
Search window opens as a floating window. The window can be sized by dragging the lower-right 
corner out or in to size the width and height.
 FIGURE 6.3
When you use the Search menu command or the Ctrl/Ô+Shift+F keyboard shortcut, the Search window 
opens as a floating window.
Basic search options
When the Search window is in view, you type a word or words to be searched for in the field box 
that appears at the top of the window. You are limited to the actual word(s) you want to find when 
you perform a simple search. You cannot use Boolean (AND, OR, and NOT) operators or any kind 
of search expressions if performing a simple search.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more sophisticated searches where you can use Boolean operators, see 
“Performing advanced searches in Acrobat/Reader” later in this chapter.
NOTE
NOTE
The area where you type words and phrases to be searched is in the field box fol-
lowing the text “What word or phrase would you like to search for?” in the Search 
window. Rather than describe this field box by name, the term “first field box” or “search field 
box” is used throughout this chapter. When you see such a reference, realize it refers to the area 
where you type words and phrases to be searched.

151
Searching PDF Files
6
If you type more than one word in the search field box, the results are reported for the exact phrase. 
For example, if you search for “Adobe Acrobat Pro,” all the occurrences of “Adobe Acrobat Pro” are 
reported in the results list. Individual occurrences of Adobe, Acrobat, and Pro are not reported. In 
other words, you don’t need to place phrases within any quotes or special characters to find the 
results.
In the Search PDF window, you choose where you want to search and the options to narrow the 
search from the list following the first field box. The following sections describe several choices 
that are available.
Where to search
The question presented to you is “Where would you like to search?” Two radio buttons appear 
where you choose whether to search the current open file or search locally on your hard drive, a 
network server, or a media storage device attached to your computer such as removable media or 
CD-ROMs. If you select the second radio button for “All PDF Documents in,” you can narrow the 
search to a directory, drive, or media device by opening the pull-down menu and choosing from 
the hierarchy of drives and folders appearing in the menu options.
Acrobat also permits you to search through bookmarks and comments as the Find toolbar does. 
Check boxes appear below the pull-down menu for these items. If bookmarks and comments are 
to be part of your search, check the respective item(s). After you choose the options you want, 
click the Search button.
The results appear in the Search window, as shown in Figure 6.4. The total number of found 
instances for your search is noted at the top of the window, and hot links appear in the scrollable 
list for the words found in the documents according to the search options you selected. Click any 
text and the respective document page opens in the Document pane with the first occurrence of 
the searched word highlighted.
Navigating search results
Menu commands are also available for navigating through search results. Choose Edit ➪ Search 
Results to open a submenu where you find four menu commands used with searches. The Next 
Result and Previous Result items are discussed in the section “Using the Find Toolbar” earlier in 
this chapter. The other two items are as follows:
n Next Document (Alt/Option+Shift+Right Arrow): Click Next Document to bypass all 
found instances in the currently viewed file and open the next file listed in the Search 
results list.
n Previous Document (Alt/Option+Shift+Left Arrow): This command offers the opposite 
response as Next Document — it moves backward through previously viewed documents.
NOTE
NOTE
Next Result and Next Document are not available until you first invoke a search. 
Next Document becomes active only when a search result exists in two or more 
documents. Previous Result and Previous Document become active only after you have visited 
a result in a document more than once so as to retrace your steps backward to see previously 
viewed results.

152
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat

 FIGURE 6.4
The total number of occurrences in a single PDF or all occurrences in all documents searched is noted at 
the top of the window (1) and search results are reported in a scrollable list (2). Click any text in the Results 
list window to open a page (3) where Search found words matching your criteria.
If you search an open document and the search results are reported in the Search window, you’re 
better off clicking results in the window than using menu commands. When you select any menu 
command, the Search window disappears (on Windows) when viewing documents in Acrobat in a 
maximized view. This is most annoying when you want to keep the Search window open. On the 
Mac you don’t have to worry about using menu commands or opening files. The Search window 
remains in view at all times until you close it.
Stopping a search
When you start a new search, a button appears in the Search window so you can stop the search. 
Click Stop and the results found prior to stopping are listed in the scrollable list. If you click Stop, 
you need to search again starting at the beginning of the search to continue. Click the New Search 
button and the search starts over from the beginning of the file.
Displaying results
The results list is neatly organized for you in the Search window. If you search the open document, 
the search results report found words beginning at the front of the document and list occurrences 
as they are found on following pages. If you search multiple documents, the occurrences are listed 
in groups according to the individual documents where the words are found. The hierarchy is sim-
ilar to that of bookmarks. A plus symbol in Windows or a right-pointing arrow in Macintosh is

shown for each document where results have been found. Click the icon, and the list expands the 
same way bookmarks and comments expand. The icon changes to a minus symbol in Windows 
or a down-pointing arrow in Macintosh when a list is expanded. Click the icon again to collapse 
the list.
NOTE
NOTE
You can use Search or the Find toolbar to find words in the open document. Search 
offers more search criteria options and shows a list of results. As a general rule, 
using Search is much more efficient than using the Find toolbar.

For information on displaying bookmarks, see Chapters 16 and 22. For information 
on displaying comments, see Chapter 20.
Searching files and folders
If you search through a large collection of PDF files, Search works away loading up the results 
window. Clicking a link to open a page where results have been found won’t interrupt your search. 
You can browse files while results continue to be reported. To search a hard disk, a media storage 
device, a network drive, or a folder in any of these locations, open the pull-down menu below 
All PDF Documents in and select a folder location. The moment you select a folder, the All PDF 
Documents in radio button is activated.
The pull-down menu lists the drives and servers active on your system. If you want to search a 
particular folder, select the item denoted as Browse for Location (Windows or Macintosh) at the 
bottom of the pull-down menu. The Browse For Folder (Windows) or Choose a folder to search 
(Macintosh) dialog box opens as shown in Figure 6.5. Navigate your hard drive as you would 
when searching for files to open. When you find the folder to be searched, click the folder name 
and click OK.
 FIGURE 6.5
Select the folder to be searched in the Browse For Folder (Windows) or Browse for Location (Macintosh) 
dialog box. Select the folder name and click OK (Windows) or Choose (Macintosh) to return to the Search

When you click a file in the Results window, the Search window becomes hidden 
by default. If you want to show the Search window after clicking a file in the Results 
window, click the Arrange Windows button at the top of the Search panel.
After you click OK in the Browse For Folder/Choose a Folder dialog box, the Search window returns. 
The search does not begin until you click the Search button. Before clicking Search, you can exam-
ine the name listed as the target folder. The selected folder is displayed in the Search window by 
folder name. If all looks as you expect, click Search.
Searching PDFs on the Internet
In Acrobat 6 we had Search the Internet using Google in the Search window and as a separate 
 tool. In Acrobat 7 we had Search the Internet using Yahoo! in the Search window and as a sepa-
rate tool. In Acrobat 8 we had nothing, and nothing in regard to searching the Internet using these 
search engines appears in Acrobat 9. The ability to search files on the Internet from a click in the 
Search window was removed in all Acrobat 8 viewers.
At first glance you may get a bit annoyed that you lost this feature in Acrobat and Reader. I can’t 
give you a precise reason for the feature disappearing in Acrobat, but my hunch is that the problem 
lies more with the Web browser developers than it does with Adobe. It may be that Adobe just 
can’t keep up with changes made by other developers when revisions are made to the browsers. 
Doing so may be cost prohibitive, and the functionality can easily be lost during an Acrobat ver-
sion life cycle when developers upgrade their products.
For whatever reason we lost the ability to click a link in the Search window to search for PDFs on 
the Internet, you can still perform this kind of search. Using a search engine such as Google, just 
type your search word or phrase in the Search text box in the Google search engine, add a space, 
and then type filetype:PDF. For example if you want to search for Acrobat 8 and have only PDFs 
reported in your search results, type “Acrobat” filetype:PDF. The Google search results report 
only PDF documents containing your search phrase.
Not all search engines support the extension for searching for PDFs. If you use Yahoo! or Ask.com, 
for example, you can’t use the extension. However, Yahoo! provides you with Advanced Search 
options. In Yahoo! click the Options pull-down menu and choose Advanced Search. The next page 
that opens provides you with options for choosing a file type such as PDF.
In some cases, advanced search options in search engines can help you narrow a search to report 
PDFs with the found results. Check your favorite search engine for advanced options to see if 
searching PDFs is supported.
Performing advanced searches in Acrobat/Reader
In all Acrobat viewers, you can search PDF documents with selected criteria without the assistance 
of a search index. To take advantage of searching with advanced options, click the Use Advanced 
Search Options link at the bottom of the Search window. When you click the link, a series of 
advanced options appears in the Search window, as shown in Figure 6.6.

Advanced search offers you options for searching index files as well as PDF files. For 
information on searching index files, see the section “Searching an index” later in 
this chapter.
Searching the open PDF file with Advanced Search Options
When you select the Current PDF Document from the Look In pull-down menu, the search options 
shown in Figure 6.6 are available to you. These options are as follows:
n Whole words only. When checked, the search results return whole words. If you search 
for forgiven, the search ignores words like for and give that make up part of the whole 
word. If the check box is disabled, various stems and parts of a whole word are included 
with the search results.
n Case-Sensitive. Letter case is ignored if the check box is disabled. If enabled, then the 
search results return only words matching the precise letter case of the searched word.

156
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
n Proximity. Proximity is a powerful tool when performing searches. If you want to search 
for two independent words that may appear together in a given context — for example, 
Acrobat and PostScript — the Proximity option finds the two words when they appear 
within a range specified in the Search preferences. The default is 900 words. You can 
change the proximity range by opening the Preferences dialog box (Ctrl/Ô+K), clicking 
Search in the left pane, and editing the Range of words for Proximity searches text box.
n Stemming. If you want to search for all words stemming from a given word, enable this 
option. Words such as header and heading stem from the word head in the English lan-
guage. If you type head in the first field box and select the Stemming option, all PDFs 
containing the search criteria from the word head are listed.
n Include Bookmarks. When Bookmarks are checked, the search results report the found 
instances in the bookmarks and the document pages.
n Include Comments. Text in comment notes and text on document pages are returned 
when this option is checked.
n Include Attachments. All document file attachments are searchable including file types 
other than PDF. Select the Include Attachments check box and found results are reported 
in the Results list for all occurrences of the searched word. Clicking a search result opens 
the attached file in the Document pane.
If you open a PDF Portfolio, the Search window changes to accommodate searching all files in the 
package. Select from the Look In pull-down menu and choose In the entire PDF Portfolio and 
Search will search all files in the package.
You can search PDF Portfolios using either the Basic search options or the Advanced search options. 
When searching package contents using Basic search options select the radio button for In the 
entire PDF Portfolio, as shown in Figure 6.7. When using the Advanced options, select In the entire 
PDF Portfolio from the Look In pull-down menu. Note that both these items are accessible only 
when you open a PDF Portfolio.

When you change the search parameters to search through a collection of PDF documents, the 
Advanced Search Options change, offering you more options to help narrow down your search, as 
shown in Figure 6.8.
 FIGURE 6.8
Advanced Search Options offer you additional criteria when searching through multiple PDF documents.
These options are as follows:
n Return results containing. Four return result options are available from this pull-down 
menu:
n Match Exact word or phrase. If you search for something like Human Resource Forms, 
only these three words together in a PDF document are returned as results. The results 
report the precise order of the words.
n Match Any of the words. Using the same example, words such as Human, Resource, 
Forms, Human Resource, Resource Forms, Human Forms, and Human Resource Forms 
would be reported in the results. Any one of the words or any combination of words 
in a phrase is reported.
n Match All of the words. In this case, all the words need to be contained in the docu-
ment, but not necessarily in the order described previously. You might see returns 
such as Forms Human Resource returned from the search.

n Boolean query. You can search PDF collections using Boolean expressions (AND, OR, 
NOT) without the assistance of a search index created with Acrobat Catalog. Note that 
Boolean queries are not available when you search an open document. You need to use 
the Advanced Search Options to search through a drive, external media, or a folder.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more detail on using Boolean queries, see the “Boolean queries” section later 
in this chapter. For more information on Acrobat Catalog, see the section “Creating 
Search Indexes (Acrobat Professional/Extended Only)” later in this chapter.
n Use these additional criteria. Up to three check boxes offer you one or a combination 
of several different options to help you refine your search. The number of check boxes 
you have available depends on the vertical size of the Search window. If you reduce the 
size, you may see only a single check box, as shown in Figure 6.8.
 
From the first pull-down menu you select the primary category. The second pull-down 
menu to the right of each primary category helps refine that particular category. The 
options for each of the three check box pull-down menus are the same. You might, for 
example, choose Date Created from the first check box option and define the date from 
the options contained in the adjacent pull-down menu. You then might add another cri-
terion and ask for the Keywords option. Adjacent to Keywords, you might specify that 
the file does not contain certain words. In the field box, you type any descriptions for the 
menu choices you make.
NOTE
NOTE
All the preceding items require that you supply at least one character in “What 
word or phrase would you like to search for?” The options that follow enable you to 
search for specific content related to the option of choice, and you do not need to supply a word 
in the first field box in order to execute a search. When you move around adjusting criteria, the 
Search button appears active or grayed out. If it is grayed out, you can’t perform a search on the 
options you chose. In some cases, the missing option is a word or phrase that needs to be added 
to the first field box.
 
From the criteria selection pull-down menu, the choices available to you are as follows:
n Date Created. If you look for PDF documents that you know were created before 
or after a certain date, use the Date Created menu option. You have four choices for 
options associated with this category available in the second pull-down menu adjacent 
to the first menu choice. These options are: Is exactly, Is before, Is after, and Is not. 
These four options are self-explanatory. When you make the choices from the two 
pull-down menus, your next step is to type the date criteria in the field box appearing 
below the pull-down menus. If, for example, you select Date Created and Is not, you 
then add the date you want to exclude from the search. As an additional aid to you, 
Acrobat offers a calendar when you select the pull-down menu from the field box, as 
shown in Figure 6.9 (Windows only). Make a date selection from the calendar and 
move to the option you want to change or click the Search button. If you click the 
month, a pop-up menu showing all months in a year opens. (Note that the calendar is 
not available on the Mac.)

After setting the date criteria from the pull-down menus, open the pull-down menu from 
the field box to open a calendar to help you find the date parameters to be searched. 
Click the month name and a pop-up menu opens showing all months in a year.
n Date Modified. The modified date searches for the date the PDF file was last modi-
fied. If you create a file on January 1, 2004 and then save some edits on July 1, 2004, 
the modified date is July 1, 2004. The manner in which you specify a date is the same 
as searching for the creation date.
n Author. The information is derived from the Document Properties in the Description 
tab. Any data typed in the Author field are searched. This choice and the remaining 
options offer two menu options in the second pull-down menu. You can select from 
Contains or Does not contain. In essence, your search includes or excludes the data 
you supply in the field box immediately following the pull-down menu choices.

description.
n Filename. The name you provide for the PDF document is searched.
n Keywords. Same as the Author search except the Keywords field is used in the docu-

n Bookmarks. When you select this option, Acrobat searches for the words in both the 
PDF document and in bookmarks. The results list includes the found words in both 
bookmarks and pages.

object with the Object Data tool and click. The metadata information displayed in the 
Object Data dialog box is searchable as well as the data contained in the Object Data 
dialog box. If you know certain attributes for images contained in a file, you can nar-

Below the Use these additional criteria pull-down menus are additional options. These options are 
the same as those used for the advanced searches on open PDF documents. Jump several pages back 
in this book to review the descriptions for the items listed at the bottom of the Search window.
Searching dates
To help you target the precise date with the field box and the calendar, Acrobat offers you several 
options. To change the year, you can edit the field box and type the year for the date to be searched. 
In the field box you can change dates by clicking the day, month, and year, and then use the up or 
down arrow keys to scroll dates. The dates revolve like an odometer. Select a day, and then click 
the month to highlight the value and press the arrow keys again until you find the correct month. 
Move to the year and follow the same steps to select the correct year. You can also select any one of 
the three values and type new values you want to search for when the text is selected. The text you 
type replaces all selected text. Acrobat accepts only a legitimate value, so if you type a value not 
permitted for a date search — for example, entering 33 in the day field — Acrobat will not accept it.
To change dates with the calendar, click the down arrow in the pull-down menu adjacent to the 
date in the field box to open the calendar. For a month change, left-click on the month name in 
the title bar of the calendar. For example, if July appears listed in the title bar, click July. Be careful 
not to left-click the mouse below the title bar because doing so selects a day and closes the calen-
dar. When you left-click on the month name in the title bar, a pop-up menu displays the months 
of the year. Move the cursor to the desired month and left-click again.
NOTE
NOTE
You can also change months by scrolling the calendar backward or forward. Click 
the left arrow in the title bar to scroll backward or the right arrow to scroll forward. 
As you reach a year beginning or end, the next month in date order is opened. For example, 
scrolling backward from January 1996 opens December 1995.
When you click to select the desired month, Acrobat leaves the calendar view open so you can still 
make the year and day selections. To change the year in the calendar, left-click on the year in the 
title bar. The year becomes visible as editable text. You can edit the field or click the up or down 
arrows.
After you select the month and year, left-click on the desired day from the calendar displayed 
below the title bar. Acrobat supplies the new date in the field box, as shown in Figure 6.10, and 
closes the calendar.

Searching metadata
The ability to search a document’s metadata is a powerful tool in Acrobat. In order to use the tool, 
you need to know just a little bit about what metadata is.
Adobe Acrobat 5.0 and later contains metadata in XML (eXtensible Markup Language) format. In 
Acrobat 7 through 9 object metadata are accessible. The metadata of a file or an image is informa-
tion related to the document structure, origination, content, interchange, and processing. Metadata 
might include, for example, the document author’s name, the creation date, modified date, the 
PDF producer, copyright information on images, color space on images, and more. When you 
click Search, the search results report all files where the searched words are contained in a docu-
ment’s metadata.
XMP (eXtensible Metadata Platform) is an XML framework that provides all Adobe programs a com-
mon language for communicating standards related to document creation and processing through-
out publishing workflows. XMP is a format, and document metadata viewed in XML source code 
can be exported to XMP format. Once in XMP, it can be exchanged between documents.
To take a look at the XML source code of the XMP metadata for a document, choose File ➪ 
Properties and click the Description tab. In the Description tab click on Additional Metadata to 
open the dialog box shown in Figure 6.11. Click Advanced and expand the listed items by clicking 
the symbol adjacent to each listed item.
At the bottom of the dialog box are buttons used for replacing, appending, saving, and deleting 
data. Click Save to export the XMP data that can be shared in workflows across many different file 
types. For the purposes of searching information, any of the text you see in the source code in the 
Advanced list can be searched.
Searching layers
The search criteria discussed on the preceding pages works for documents containing layers. When 
you invoke a search in documents containing layers, Search automatically searches through all lay-
ers for the criteria you specify in the Search window. The results list contains items on any hidden 
layers as well as all visible layers. When you click a result associated with a hidden layer, Acrobat 
prompts you in a dialog box, as shown in Figure 6.12, asking whether you want to make the layer 
visible.

162
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat

 FIGURE 6.11
To see document metadata click the Additional Metadata button in the Description Properties dialog box.
 FIGURE 6.12
If searched words are found on hidden layers, Acrobat asks whether you want to make the hidden layer 
visible.
If you click Yes in the dialog box, the layer is made visible and the search stops at the found word. If 
you select No, the layer remains hidden and you are taken to the next search result.
Boolean queries
The Return results containing pull-down menu in the Search PDF window contains a Boolean 
query menu option for searching with Boolean expressions. Boolean expressions include AND, OR, 
and NOT. Acrobat recognizes these Boolean operators when you invoke a search. You can use all 
the previously listed criteria when you want to use the Boolean expressions option.

163
Searching PDF Files

To search with Boolean expressions you need to search an index file. Boolean operators are not 
recognized when searching the current open document or when browsing folders.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more on searching indexes, see the section “Creating Search Indexes (Acrobat 
Pro/Extended Only)” later in this chapter.
n AND operator. Use AND between two words to find documents that contain both terms, 
in any order. For example, type Paris AND France to identify documents that contain 
both Paris and France. Searches with AND and no other Boolean operators produce the 
same results as selecting the All Of The Words option.
NOTE
NOTE
When using Boolean operators, the text is not case-sensitive. Uppercase letters for 
the Boolean expressions are used here to denote a Boolean operator as opposed to 
text. You can use lowercase letters and the results are reported the same, as long as the Boolean 
query pull-down menu item is selected.
n OR operator. Use to search for all instances of either term. For example, type email OR 
email to find all documents with occurrences of either spelling. Searches with OR and 
no other Boolean operators produce the same results as selecting the Any Of The Words 
option.
n ^ (exclusive OR). Use to search for all instances that have either term but not both. For 
example, type cat ^ dog to find all documents with occurrences of either cat or dog but 
not both cat and dog.
n (). Use parentheses to specify the order of evaluation of terms. For example, type white 
AND (whale OR Ahab) to find all documents that contain either white and whale or 
white and Ahab. (The query processor performs an OR query on whale and Ahab and 
then performs an AND query on those results with white.
n NOT operator. Use before a search term to exclude any documents that contain that term. 
For example, type NOT Kentucky to find all documents that don’t contain the word 
Kentucky. Or, type Paris NOT Kentucky to find all documents that contain the word 
Paris but not the word Kentucky.
n Multiple words. Words appearing together such as “Acrobat PDF” can be included in 
quotes. You would supply “Acrobat PDF” in the field box (include the quotes) and all 
instances where these two words appear together are reported in the search results. If the 
words are not contained within quotes, the words Acrobat, PDF, and Acrobat PDF would 
all be returned in the search results. This behavior is similar to how you perform searches 
in Web browsers.
n Searching and, or, not. If you want to search for a term where these three words are part 
of the term, you can by distinguishing between words you search for and using operators. 
To search for something like Ben and Jerry’s as a term, you would type “Ben and Jerry’s” 
within quote marks. If you want to search for two terms and a Boolean operator you 
might use “Ben and Jerry’s” AND “Ice Cream” NOT yogurt. The results report back to 
you the documents where the words Ben and Jerry’s and ice cream are contained in the 
files and the words Ben and Jerry’s yogurt are not reported in the search results.

Search preferences
To open preference settings for Search, choose Edit ➪ Preferences (Windows) or Acrobat Preferences 
(Macintosh). In the left pane, select Search. The preference options available to you are shown in 
Figure 6.13.
 FIGURE 6.13
Choose Edit ➪ Preferences to open the Preferences dialog box. Click Search in the list at the left to display 
preference settings for using Search.
The preference choices listed on the right side of the dialog box are as follows:
n
Ignore Asian character width. This setting ignores Asian character width and finds both 
half-width and full-width instances of Asian language characters.
n Ignore Diacritics and Accents. A diacritic is an accent mark like you might use on a 
word such as resumé or the cedilla on a word such as façade to indicate a special phonetic 
value. These and other accents are ignored during a search unless you check the box; so 
for example, if you have it checked Acrobat will find both resume and resumé. If it is 
unchecked, Search looks for resumé only.

165

n Always use advanced search options. Sets the Advanced Search Options as the default. 
When the check box is enabled you don’t need to keep clicking the Use Advanced Search 
Options button in the Search window. Enable this setting if you find yourself always 
using the Advanced Search Options.
n Maximum number of documents returned in Results. The acceptable range is between 
1 and 10,000. Enter a value and the results are limited to this number.
n Range of words for proximity searches. When using Boolean operators, you might 
want to search for two words within a defined range of words. You can enter a value 
between 1 and 10,000. Both words need to be within the range when you use a Boolean 
expression such as AND.
n Enable fast find. Searches are logged by Acrobat in a memory cache. If you perform a 
search and later in another session perform a search on the same information, Acrobat 
returns to the cache for the information, thus speeding up the search. You can edit the 
cache size by editing the field box for the number of megabytes on your hard drive you 
want to allocate to the cache. Be certain you have ample hard drive space when enabling 
the cache and raising the cache size.
n Purge Cache Contents. The cache occupies as much memory as is available on your 
hard drive. If you want to clear the cache, click the button to erase all the contents.
After changing any settings in the Preferences dialog box, click OK. The changes you make are 
dynamically reflected in Acrobat and take effect the next time you perform a search.
Document Descriptions
Document descriptions are user-supplied data fields used to help you identify PDF files according 
to title, subject, author, and keywords. At the time you create a PDF document, you may have 
options for supplying a document description. In other cases, you may add descriptions in Acrobat 
either individually or with Acrobat’s batch processing features.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
To learn how to create batch sequences, see Chapter 18.
After you add descriptions and save your files, the data added to these fields are searchable via 
advanced searches and index file searches. Developing an organized workflow with specific guide-
lines for users to follow regarding document descriptions significantly helps all your colleagues 
search PDFs much more efficiently.
To add a document description, choose File ➪  Properties. When the Document Properties dialog 
box opens, click the Description tab, as shown in Figure 6.14.

166
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
 FIGURE 6.14
You add document descriptions to the Descriptions tab in the Document Properties dialog box.
The four fields for document descriptions are as follows:
n Title. The Title field in this example contains a description of a form. Other forms in a 
company using a similar schema might use titles such as W-2 Form, Travel Expense, 
Employee Leave, and so on in the Title field.
n Author. In the example, the Author field contains the department authoring the form. 
Notice that an employee name is not used for the Author field. Rather than use employee 
names, use departments instead. Using departments is a much better choice because a 
company typically turns over employees more often than it renames departments.
n Subject. In the example, the Subject field contains Form. The Subject here might be used 
to distinguish a Form from a Policy, Procedure, Memo, Directive, and so on.
n Keywords. The first entry in the Keywords field is the form number used by the company 
to identify the form. Other words in the Keywords field are descriptors related to the form 
contents. If you want to add an employee author name, add it to the Keywords field.

Notice the Location item in the Document Properties. The text reports the location 
on your hard drive where the file is located. This text is a link. Click the text and 
your file is opened on the Desktop (Finder on Mac) showing you the folder location.
The reason the field information is important for any organization using a PDF workflow is that 
document description information can be used when someone searches a collection of PDF files. 
Each field is searchable by the summary title and the words contained in the fields. Therefore, a 
user can search for all PDF files where the Title field contains the word Purchase and the Subject 
field contains the word Form. The search results display all PDF documents where the Title and 
Subject fields have these words contained in the document description.
As a comparison, imagine searching for the words Purchase Order. The search would return all 
PDFs where these words appear in either the document summary or the text in the PDF files. 
Purchase Order might be used in memos, policies, procedures, and forms. The user might have to 
search through many PDFs in order to find the Purchase Order form, thus spending much more 
time trying to locate the right document.
Searching document descriptions
To search for document descriptions, you need to use either the advanced search or an index file 
search. Press Ctrl/Ô+Shift+F to open the Search window in an Acrobat viewer and click Use 
Advanced Search Options. Select a folder to search from the Look In pull-down menu.
CROSS-REF

For searching index files, see the section “Searching an index” later in this chapter.
Under Use these additional criteria, select one of the description items from the first pull-down 
menu (Title, Author, Subject, or Keywords). Select either Contains or Does not contain from the 
pull-down menu adjacent to the first menu. Type the words to be searched in the field box below 
the pull-down menus. Continue adding additional description fields as desired. In Figure 6.15, 
two description fields are marked for the search.
 FIGURE 6.15
Two description fields are identified. When you click the Search button, Acrobat searches the document 
descriptions for matches.

168
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
Note that no criteria need to be supplied in the first field box for specific words to be searched in 
the document. If you click Search in the Search window with the descriptions shown in Figure 6.15, 
all PDF files in the designated folder with the words Purchase Order in the Title field and Forms in 
the Subject field are returned in the results list for files matching the criteria.
Document descriptions and Boolean queries
You can add Boolean queries when searching document descriptions. You might know some con-
tent in PDF files as well as information contained in the document descriptions. In this case you 
address the additional criteria items in the same manner and add the Boolean query as discussed 
earlier in this chapter. In Figure 6.16, document descriptions are added to a Boolean query.
 FIGURE 6.16
You can add Boolean queries to searches with additional criteria selections such as document descriptions.
When you click the Search button, the number of results returned in the Search window is signif-
icantly reduced compared to searching for individual words — especially when common words 
are contained in many PDF documents. What the document descriptions offer you is a method 
for targeting the exact file you’re looking for as fast as possible. If you have 100 PDF documents 
in the search results list, looking through the list and finding the file you want will take some 
time. Compare that to two or three files listed. Obviously, the document descriptions offer signifi-
cant time savings as you search PDFs from among very large collections.
Full-Text Versus Index Searches
This section represents a pivotal point in this chapter. What has been covered so far is information 
about finding content in PDF documents with a very elaborate find feature in Acrobat. The name used 
in Acrobat to refer to what has been discussed so far is “Search.” Users of earlier versions of Acrobat 

169
Searching PDF Files

may take this to mean using Acrobat Search as it was used in Acrobat viewers earlier than version 6.0. 
What has been covered thus far, however, is a Search of data files that was greatly improved in 
Acrobat version 6 and became more powerful in returning results in Acrobat version 8. To under-
stand the difference between the preceding pages and what follows requires a little explanation.
In addition to full-text searches for documents, you can also create a separate index file and search 
one or more indexes at a time. Index files provide some benefit in that they are quite faster than 
full-text searches, can be automatically assigned to PDF documents in the Advanced tab in the 
Document Properties, and can be automatically loaded from a CD-ROM, and multiple indexes can 
be searched, so files can be scattered on your hard drive in different folders.
Search Index Procedures
I explain the details for working with search indexes in the remaining pages in this chapter. To 
provide you with an overall summary for how index file creation and management is dealt with in 
Acrobat, I give you a short summary of the procedures here.
Using index files to perform searches begins with using a current index file or creating a new one. 
Users who have been working with index files need to make sure that all their previous indexes are 
updated for compatibility with Acrobat 9.0 viewers.
Index files are created and updated with Acrobat Catalog with Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended only. 
Catalog is available from a menu selection in the Advanced menu. Select Advanced ➪ Document 
Processing ➪ Full Text Index with Catalog. You open Catalog and make a decision for creating a 
new index or opening an existing index file for rebuilding or editing in the Catalog window.
After an index file is created or updated, you load the index file into the Search window. Multiple 
index files can be loaded and searched. When you search index files, the results are reported in the 
Search window like all the searches discussed earlier in this chapter.
Earlier releases of Acrobat offered you options for various menu selections related to managing 
indexes and loading new index files. Earlier releases of Acrobat also offered you dialog boxes where 
results were reported and information about an index file could be obtained. In Acrobat 6.0 and 
above viewers, you handle all your index file management in the Search window. Menu commands 
are limited to viewing search results as described earlier in this chapter.
If you edit PDF documents, delete them, or add new documents to folders that have been indexed, 
you need to rebuild index files periodically. You can purge old data and re-index files in Acrobat 
Catalog. Index files can be copied to different hard drive locations, across servers, and to external 
media. When copying files, you need to copy all files and folders associated with the index file. 
Failure to copy all the files renders the index inoperable.

Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
Creating Search Indexes (Acrobat Pro/
Extended Only)
In order to search an index file, you must have one present on your computer, network server, 
some media storage device, or embedded in a PDF. When you install an Acrobat viewer, a help 
index file is included during your installation. You can use this file to search for words contained 
in any of the help documents. If you want to search your own files, you need to create an index. 
To create an index file, you use Acrobat Catalog.
NOTE
NOTE
Acrobat Catalog is available only in Acrobat Pro and Acrobat Pro Extended. Search 
indexes can be used by all Acrobat viewers including Adobe Reader.
To launch Acrobat Catalog from within Acrobat Pro choose Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ 
Full Text Index with Catalog. Catalog is robust and provides many options for creating and modi-
fying indexes. After a search index is created, any user can access the search index in all Acrobat 
viewers to find words using the Search window. However, before you begin to work with Acrobat 
Catalog, you need to take some preliminary steps to be certain all your files are properly prepared 
and ready to be indexed.
Preparing PDFs for indexing
Preparation involves creating PDFs with all the necessary information to facilitate searches. All 
searchable document description information needs to be supplied in the PDF documents at the 
time of PDF creation or by modifying PDFs in Acrobat before you begin working with Catalog. 
For workgroups and multiple user access to search indexes, this information needs to be clear and 
consistent. Other factors, such as naming conventions, location of files, and optimizing perfor-
mance should all be thought out and planned prior to creating an index file.
NOTE
NOTE
Adding document descriptions is not a requirement for creating search indexes. 
You can index files without any information in the document description fields. 
Adding document descriptions merely adds more relevant information to your PDF documents 
and aids users in finding search results faster.
Document descriptions
Document description information should be supplied in all PDF files to be searched. As discussed 
earlier in this chapter, all document description data are searchable. Spending time creating docu-
ment descriptions and defining the field types for consistent organization will facilitate searches 
performed by multiple users.
The first of the planning steps is to develop a flow chart or outline of company information and the 
documents to be categorized. This organization may or may not be implemented where you intend 
to develop a PDF workflow. If your information flow is already in place, you may need to make 
some modifications to coordinate nomenclature and document identity with the document sum-
mary items in Acrobat.

171
Searching PDF Files
6
Document descriptions contained in the Title, Subject, Author, and Keywords fields should be con-
sistent and intuitive. They should also follow a hierarchy consistent with the company’s organiza-
tional structure and workflow. The document summary items should be mapped out and defined. 
When preparing files for indexing, consider the following:
n Title. Title information might be thought of as the root of an outline — the parent state-
ment, if you will. Descriptive titles should be used to help users narrow searches within 
specific categories. The Title field can also be used to display the title name at the top of 
the Acrobat window when you select viewing titles in the Initial View properties.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on how to set document title attributes in the Initial View dialog 
box, see Chapter 5.
n Author. Avoid using proper names for the Author field. Personnel change in companies 
and roles among employees change. Identify the author of PDF documents according to 
departments, work groups, facilities, and so on.
n Subject. If the Title field is the parent item in an outline format, the Subject would be a 
child item nested directly below the title. Subjects might be considered subsets of titles. 
When creating document summaries, be consistent. Don’t use subject and title or subject 
and keyword information back and forth with different documents. If an item, such as 
employee grievances, is listed as a Subject in some PDFs and then listed as a Title in other 
documents, the end users will become confused with the order and searches will become 
unnecessarily complicated.
n Keywords. If you have a forms identification system in place, be certain to use form 
numbers and identity as part of the Keywords field. You might start the Keywords field 
with a form number and then add additional keywords to help narrow searches. Be con-
sistent and always start the Keywords field with forms or document numbers. If you need 
to have PDF author names, add them here in the Keywords fields. If employees change 
roles or leave the company, the Author fields still provide the information relative to a 
department.
To illustrate some examples, take a look at Table 6.1.
TIP
TIP
Legacy PDF files used in an organization may have been created without a document 
description, or you may reorganize PDFs and want to change document summaries. 
To quickly (or efficiently) update these documents, you can create a batch sequence to change 
multiple PDF files and then run the sequence. Place your PDFs in a folder where the document 
summaries are to be edited. In the Edit Sequence dialog box, select the items to change and edit 
each document summary item. Run the sequence to update an entire folder of PDFs.

Managing Multiple PDF Documents
B
ooks, reports, and manuals can be broken up into separate files and structured in a way that it still 
appears to the end user as a single document. Assuming a user reads through a file in a linear 
fashion, you can create links to open and close pages without user intervention. Create navigational 
buttons to move forward and back through document pages. On the last page of each chapter, use 
the navigation button to open the next chapter. Also on the last page of each chapter, create a Page 
action that closes the current document when the page is closed. (See Chapter 22 for creating links 
and Page actions.) If the end user disables “Open cross-document links in same window” in the 
Documents category in the Preferences dialog box, the open file still closes after the last page is 
closed. All the chapters can be linked from a table of contents where any chapter can be opened. If 
you give your design some thought, browsing the contents of books will appear to the end user no 
different than reading a book in the analog world.

File structure
The content, filenames, and location of PDFs to be cataloged contribute to file structure items. All the 
issues related to file structure must be thought out and appropriately designed for the audience that 
you intend to support. The important considerations are as follows:
n File naming conventions. Names provided for the PDF files are critical for distributing 
documents among users. If filenames get truncated, then either Acrobat Search or the end 
user will have difficulty finding a document when performing a search. This is of special 
concern to Macintosh users who want to distribute documents across platforms. The 
best precaution is to always use standard DOS file-naming conventions. The standard 
eight-character maximum filename, with no more than three-character file extensions 
(filename.ext), will always work regardless of platform.
n Folder names. Folder names should follow the same conventions as filenames. Macintosh 
users who want to keep filenames longer than standard DOS names must limit folder 
names to eight characters and no more than a three-character file extension for cross-
platform compliance.
n File and folder name identity. In previous versions of Acrobat and Acrobat Catalog you 
had to avoid using ASCII characters from 133 to 159 for any filename or folder name. 
Acrobat Catalog in earlier versions did not support some extended characters in this range, 
and you could experience problems when using files across platforms. (Figure 6.17 lists 
the characters we used to have to avoid.) In Acrobat 8 and 9, with more support for non-
English languages and full Unicode characters, you don’t need to be worried about file 
and folder identity that use special characters.
 FIGURE 6.17
Extended characters from ASCII 133 to ASCII 159 used to be a problem when using 
Acrobat Catalog. In Acrobat 8 and 9 you’ll find support for creating index files and 
searching files and folders containing these characters.
n Folder organization. Folders to be cataloged should have a logical hierarchy. Copy all 
files to be cataloged to a single folder or a single folder with nested folders in the same 
path. When nesting folders, be certain to keep the number of nested folders to a mini-
mum. Deeply nested folders slow down searches, and path names longer than 256 char-
acters create problems.

174
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
n Folder locations. Windows users must keep the location of folders on a local hard drive 
or a network server volume. Although Macintosh users can catalog information across 
computer workstations, creating separate indexes for files contained on separate drives 
would be advisable. Any files moved to different locations make searches inoperable.
n PDF structure. File and folder naming should be handled before creating links and 
attaching files. If filenames are changed after the PDF structure has been developed, many 
links become inoperable. Be certain to complete all editing in the PDF documents before 
cataloging files.
Optimizing performance
Searches can be performed very fast if you take a little time in creating the proper structure and 
organization. If you don’t avoid some pitfalls with the way that you organize files, then searches 
perform much slower. A few considerations to be made include the following:
n Optimize PDF files. Optimization should be performed on all PDF files as one of the last 
steps in your workflow. Use the Save As optimizes for Fast Web View found in the 
General category in the Preferences dialog box and run the PDF Optimizer located in the 
Advanced menu (Acrobat Pro and Acrobat Pro Extended only). Optimization is especially 
important for searches to be performed from CD-ROM files.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on PDF Optimizer, see Chapter 18.
n Break up long PDF files. Books, reports, essays, and other documents that contain 
many pages should be broken up into multiple PDF files. If you have books to be cata-
loged, break up the books into separate chapters. Acrobat Search runs much faster when 
finding information from several small files. It slows down when searching through long 
documents.
TIP
TIP
If you have a single document such as a book you want to distribute on CD-ROM, 
you can embed an index file in the PDF. (See “Working with Embedded Index Files” 
later in this chapter).
Creating search help
You can have multiple indexes for various uses and different workgroups. Personnel may use one 
index for department matters, another for company-wide information, and perhaps another for a 
research library. In a search, all relevant keywords will appear from indexes loaded in the Index 
Selection dialog box. When using multiple indexes, employees may forget the structure of docu-
ment summaries and what index is needed for a given search.
You can create README files and index help files to store key information about what search words 
can be used to find document summaries. You can create a single PDF file, text files, or multiple 
files that serve as help. Figure 6.18 shows an example of a PDF help file that might be used to find 
documents related to a company’s personnel policies, procedures, and forms.

175

 FIGURE 6.18
A PDF help file can assist users in knowing what keywords they need to use for the Title, Subject, Author, 
and Keywords fields.
In the top-right corner of Figure 6.18, the document summary for the help file is listed. The Title 
fields for this company are broken into categories for policies, procedures, forms, and charts. The 
Subject fields break down the title categories into specific personnel items, and the Author fields 
contain the department that authored the documents. Form numbers appear for all Keywords 
fields.
TIP
TIP
When creating help files that guide a user for searching document information, 
use a common identifier in the Subject, Author, and Keywords fields reserved for 
finding only help files. In Figure 6.18, the identifier is “Table.” Whenever a user searches for the 
word table in the Author field, the only returns in the Search Results dialog box will be help files. 
When using the Title and Author field together, a user can find a specific help file for a given 
department. In the previous example, the Title is HR and the Author is Table. When these words 
are searched for the document information, the help file for the HR department is returned in 
the Search Results. If you reserve keywords for the document Summary fields, any employee 
can easily find information by remembering only a few keywords.
Creating a new index file
After your files are optimized and saved in final form, it’s time to create the search index. Choose 
Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Full Text Index with Catalog to open the Catalog dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 6.19. In the dialog box, you make choices for creating a new index file or open-
ing an existing index file. Click the New Index button to create a new index file.

176
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
 FIGURE 6.19
Click the New Index button in the Catalog dialog box to create an index file.
The New Index Definition dialog box shown in Figure 6.20 opens, in which you set specific attri-
butes for your index and determine what folder(s) are to be indexed.
Index title
The title that you place in this field is a title for the index but not necessarily the name of the file 
you ultimately save. The name you enter here does not need to conform to any naming conven-
tions because in most cases it won’t be the saved filename. When you open an index file, you 
search your hard drive, server, or external media for a filename that ends with a .pdx extension. 
When you visit the Search window and select Look In ➪ Select Index, the Index Selection dialog 
box opens, as shown in Figure 6.21. What appears in the Index Selection dialog box is a list of 
indexes appearing according to the Index Title names. These names are derived from what you 
type in the Index Title field in Acrobat Catalog.
NOTE
NOTE
When you get ready to build a file, Acrobat prompts you for the index filename. By 
default the text you type in the Index Title field is listed in the File name field in the 
Save Index File dialog box. This dialog box opens when you click the Build button in the Catalog 
dialog box (see the section “Building the index” later in this chapter). In most cases where you 
supply a name as a description in the Index Title, you’ll want to change the filename to a name 
consistent with standard DOS conventions (that is, eight-character maximum with a three-char-
acter maximum extension). Make this change when you are prompted to save the file.

CAUTION 
CAUTION
If you see an index name grayed out, the index is not available to your Acrobat 
viewer. You may have moved the index file to another location on your hard drive, 
deleted the file, or tried to search an index on a CD-ROM that is not mounted. In order to bring 
back the index and make it available to your viewer, you need to delete the grayed out index 
name by clicking the Remove button and then add the file or rebuild and Add the file in the 
Index selection dialog box.
Index description
You can supply as many as 256 characters in the Index Description field. Descriptive names and 
keywords should be provided so that the end user knows what each index contains. Index descrip-
tions should be thought of as adding more information to the items mentioned earlier in this chapter 
regarding document descriptions. Index descriptions can help users find the index file that addresses 
their needs.
When an index is loaded, the index title appears in the Select Indexes dialog box. To get more 
information about an index file, click the Info button shown in Figure 6.21. The Index information 
dialog box opens as shown in Figure 6.22. The Index information dialog box shows you the title 
from the Index Title field and the description added in Acrobat Catalog in the Index Description 
field.
 FIGURE 6.22
The Index Description is contained in the Index information dialog box. Users can click on the Info button 
in the Index selection dialog box to see the description added in the Index Description field box in Acrobat 
Catalog.
Include these directories
If you add nothing to the Include these directories field, Catalog won’t build an index because it 
won’t know where to look for the PDF files to be included in the index. Adding the directory path(s) 
is essential before you begin to build the index. Notice the first Add button on the right side of the 

179
Searching PDF Files
6
dialog box in Figure 6.20. After you click Add, a navigation dialog box opens, enabling you to 
identify the directory where the PDFs to be indexed are located. You can add many directories to 
the Include these directories list. These directories can be in different locations on your hard drive. 
When a given directory is selected, all subfolders will also be indexed for all directory locations 
unless you choose to exclude certain folders. When the directories have been identified, the direc-
tory path and folder name will appear in the Include these directories field.
Exclude these subdirectories
If you have files in a subdirectory within the directory you are indexing and want to exclude the 
subdirectory, you can do so in the Exclude these subdirectories field. The folder names and direc-
tory paths of excluded directories appear in the Exclude these subdirectories field, as shown in 
Figure 6.20.
Remove
If you decide to remove a directory from either the Include these directories or Exclude these 
subdirectories lists, select an item in the list and click the Remove button. You can add or delete 
directories in either list prior to building an index or when modifying an index.
Saving index definitions
Two buttons appear at the top right corner of the Catalog dialog box for saving a definition. If you 
begin to develop an index file and supply the index title and a description and want to come back 
to Catalog later, you can save what you type in the Index Definition dialog box using the Save As 
button. The Save button does not appear active until you have saved a file with the Save As option 
or you’re working on a file that has been built. Saving the file only saves the definition for the index. 
It does not create an index file. The Save As option enables you to prepare files for indexing and 
interrupt your session if you need to return later. For example, suppose you add an index title and 
you write an index description. If you need to quit Acrobat at this point, click Save As and save the 
definition to disk. You can then return later and resume creating the index by adding the directories 
to be cataloged and building the index.
After you have saved a file, you can update the file with the Save button. After a definition is saved, 
when you return to Acrobat Catalog, you can click the Open button in the Catalog dialog box and 
resume editing the definition file. When all the options for your search index have been determined, 
you click the Build button to actually create the index file.
Using Save As or Save is not required to create an index file. If you set all your attributes for the 
index and click the Build button, Acrobat Catalog prompts you in the Save Index File dialog box to 
supply a name for the index and save the definition. Essentially, Catalog is invoking the Save As 
command for you.
If at any time you click the Cancel button in the lower-right corner of the Index Definition dialog 
box, all edits are lost for the current session. If you add definition items without saving you’ll need 
to start over when you open the Index Definition dialog box again. If you start to work on a saved 
file and click Cancel without saving new edits, your file reverts to the last saved version.

Setting options
To the right of the Index Description field is a button labeled Options. Click this button and the 
Options dialog box appears, allowing you to choose from a number of different attributes for your 
index file, as shown in Figure 6.23. Some of these options are similar to the Preference settings for 
Acrobat Catalog you made in the Preferences dialog box. Any edits you make here supersede 
Preference settings.

For information on setting Catalog preferences, see “Setting Catalog preferences” 
later in this chapter.
 FIGURE 6.23
Clicking the Options button adjacent to the Index Description field opens the Options dialog box. Here 
you can assign further attributes to the index file.
Do not include numbers
The first item in the Options dialog box is a check box for excluding numbers. By selecting the Do 
not include numbers option, you can reduce the file size, especially if data containing many numbers 
are part of the PDF file(s) to be indexed. Keep in mind, however, that if numbers are excluded, 
Search won’t find numeric values.
Add IDs to Adobe v1.0 files
Because Acrobat is now in version 9, finding old PDF 1.0 files that need to be updated with IDs 
may rarely happen. If you do have legacy files saved as PDF 1.0 format, it would be best to batch 
process the older PDFs by saving them out of Acrobat 9.0. As software changes, many previous 
formats may not be supported with recent updates. For better performance, update older docu-
ments to newer file formats.

If you have legacy files that haven’t been updated and you want to include them in your search 
index, check the box. If you’re not certain whether the PDFs were created with Acrobat 1.0 com-
patibility, check it anyway just to be safe.
Do not warn for changed documents when searching
If you create an index file, and then return to the index in Acrobat Catalog and perform some main-
tenance functions, save the index, and start searching the index, Acrobat notifies you in a dialog 
box that changes have been made and asks whether you want to proceed. To sidestep the opening 
of the warning dialog box, check the Do not warn for changed documents when searching option.
Custom properties
The Custom Properties button opens the Custom Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 6.24. 
Custom Properties are used when customizing Acrobat with the Acrobat Software Development Kit 
(SDK). This item is intended for programmers who want to add special features to Acrobat. To add 
a Custom Property to be indexed, you should have knowledge in programming and the PDF format.
You add Custom Properties to the field box and select the type of property to be indexed from 
the pull-down menu. You type the property values in the field box, identify the type, and click the 
Add button. The property is then listed in the window below the Custom Property field box.
 FIGURE 6.24
You can add custom data fields to Acrobat with the Acrobat Software Development Kit.
The types available from the pull-down menu are as follows:
n String. This is any text string. If numbers are included with this option they are treated 
as text.
n Integer. The integer field can accept values between 0 and 65,535.
n Date. This is a date value.

XMP Fields
Click XMP Fields and another dialog box opens in which you add to a list of XMP fields. The dia-
log box is virtually identical to the Stop Words dialog box shown in Figure 6.25. Type a name in 
the field box and click the Add button. All new XMP fields are added to the list window.
Stop Words
To optimize an index file to produce faster search results, you can add stop words. You may have 
words, such as the, a, an, of, and so on that would typically not be used in a search. You can choose 
to exclude such words by typing the word in the Word field box and clicking the Add button in 
the Stop Words dialog box. Click Stop Words in the Options dialog box to open the Stop Words 
dialog box shown in Figure 6.25. To eliminate a word after it has been added, select the word and 
click the Remove button. Keep in mind that every time you add a word, you are actually adding it 
to a list of words to be excluded.
 FIGURE 6.25
You can eliminate words from an index file by adding words in the Stop Words dialog box. Adding a word 
to the list excludes it from the index file.
TIP
TIP
You can create an elaborate list of stop words and may want to apply the list to sev-
eral index files, but Acrobat (as of this writing) does not include an ability to import 
or swap a list of words to be excluded from an index file. For a workaround, you can open any 
existing Index Definition field and change all attributes except the stop words. Add a new index 
title, a new index description, and select a new directory for indexing. Save the definition to a 
new filename and click the Build button. A new index is built using the stop words created in 
another index. In workgroups you can save an index definition file without adding directories 
and use it as a template so all index files have consistent settings for the stop words.

Structure tags
If you have a tagged PDF you can search document tags when the tags are included in the search 
index. Click Structure Tags in the Options dialog box to open the Tags dialog box shown in Figure 
6.26. Tagged PDFs with a tagged root and elements can have any item in the tagged logical tree 
marked for searching. To observe the tags in a PDF file, open the Tags palette and expand the tree. 
All the tags nest like a Bookmark list. When you want to mark tags for searching, type the tag 
name in the Tags dialog box and click the Add button. You remove tags from the list window by 
selecting a tag and clicking the Remove button.

For more information on tagged PDF documents and using the Tags palette, see 
Chapter 25.
 FIGURE 6.26
You can mark tags for searches in index files by adding tag names in the Tags dialog box.
Building the index
After you’ve set all the attributes for the index definition, the index file is ready to be created. 
Clicking the Build button in the New Index Definition dialog box creates indexes. When you click 
this button, Acrobat Catalog opens the Save Index File dialog box where you supply a filename 
and target a destination on your hard drive. The default file extension is .pdx. Do not modify the 
file extension name. Acrobat recognizes these files when loading search indexes.
The location where you instruct Catalog to save your index file can be any location on your hard 
drive regardless of where the files being indexed reside. You can choose to save the index file inside 
or outside the folder that Catalog created during the indexing. Therefore, you have an index file and 
a folder containing index resources. The relationship between the index file and resource folder 
locations is critical to the usability of the index. If you move the index file to a different location 
without moving the supporting folder, the index is rendered unusable. To avoid problems, try to 
create a folder either when you are in the Save Index File dialog box or before you open Catalog 
and save your index file to your new folder. Make the name descriptive and keep the index file 

184
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
together in this folder. When you want to move the index to another directory, another computer, 
or to an external media cartridge or CD-ROM, copy the folder containing the index and supporting 
files.
Click the Save button in the Save Index File dialog box, and Catalog closes the Index Definition 
dialog box, returns you to the Catalog dialog box, and begins to process all the files in the target 
folder(s). Depending on how many files are indexed, the time to complete the build may be con-
siderable. Don’t interrupt the processing if you want to complete the index generation. When 
Catalog finishes, the progress bar stops and the last line of text in the Catalog dialog box reads 
“Index build successful.” If for some reason the build is not successful, you can scroll the window 
in the Catalog dialog box and view errors reported in the list.
Stopping builds
If you want to interrupt a build, you can click the Stop button while a build is in progress. When 
building an index, Catalog opens a file where all the words and markers to the PDF pages are writ-
ten. When you click the Stop button, Catalog saves the open file to disk and closes it with the 
indexed items up to the point you stopped the build. Therefore, the index is usable after stopping 
a build and you can search for words in the partial index. When you want to resume, you can 
open the file in Catalog and click the Rebuild button.
Building existing indexes
When files are deleted from indexed folders and new files are added to the indexed folders, you’ll 
want to maintain the index file and update it to reflect any changes. You can open an index file and 
click Build for a quick update. New files are scanned and added to the index, but the deleted files 
are marked for deletion without actually deleting the data. To delete invalid data, you need to 
use the Purge button. Purging can take a considerable amount of time even on small index files. 
Therefore, your routine maintenance might be to consistently build a file, and only periodically 
purge data.
Building legacy index files
When you open an index file created with an Acrobat Catalog version earlier than 6.0, a dialog box 
opens, informing you the index is not compatible with the current version of Acrobat. In the dialog 
box you have three options: Create copy, Overwrite old index, and Cancel. Click the Create copy 
button to make a copy of the index file. A new index file is created leaving the original index file 
undisturbed. You can click the Overwrite old index button and the file rewrites, replacing the old 
index. If you choose this option your new index file won’t be compatible with Acrobat viewers ear-
lier than version 6.0. Clicking Cancel in this dialog box returns you to the Index Selection dialog 
box, leaving the index file undisturbed.
If you create a search index using Acrobat Catalog version 9, the index file is backward-compatible 
to Acrobat 6. All Acrobat viewers can use index files suited to the appropriate version.
If you know some users won’t be working with the new Acrobat viewers, then be certain to make 
copies of your index files. Until all users have upgraded to a viewer 6.0 or higher, you may need to 
organize your indexes according to viewer versions.

185

Building index files from secure documents
In Acrobat versions lower than 6.0 you could not create index files from secure PDFs encrypted 
with either Acrobat Standard Security or Acrobat Self-Sign Security. Version 6.0 of Acrobat afforded 
complete access to secure files with Acrobat Catalog if the right permissions were applied. When 
applying Password Security in Acrobat 6 through Acrobat 9 you need to enable text access for 
screen reader devices in order to index a secure file. Creating an index does not compromise your 
security and doesn’t affect all other permissions you set forth when the files are saved.
If you have legacy files that have been secured, you can index them like other files saved in earlier 
PDF format compatibilities. These files, and any other files you create with Acrobat Pro or Acrobat 
Pro Extended, can be used only by Acrobat viewers 6.0 and later.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on encryption and security, see Chapter 26.
Rebuilding an index
Rebuilding index files completely recreates a new index. You can open an Acrobat 9 compatible 
index file and click Rebuild. The file rewrites the file you opened much like you would use a Save 
As menu command to rewrite a PDF document. If a substantial number of PDF documents have 
been deleted and new files added to the indexed folders, rebuilding the index could take less time 
than purging data.
The Structure of Index Files
U
sers who have created index files in all earlier versions of Acrobat are no doubt familiar with 
the end product of creating a search index. As you may recall, the index file with a .pdx exten-
sion and nine subfolders containing all associated files were produced by Acrobat Catalog for every 
new index. The relationship between the index file and subfolders in terms of directory paths needed 
to be preserved in order for the index to work properly. When you copied an index file to another 
directory or source, you needed to copy all the files together and keep the same relative path 
between the files.
When you produce an index file in Acrobat Pro, you won’t find the same nine folders created during 
the index build with Acrobat version 5 and earlier. Acrobat Catalog 6.0 through 9creates a single 
folder where files with an .idx extension reside. The relative directory path is still a factor in relocat-
ing files, but in Acrobat 6.0 through 9 you need only copy an index file and a single folder to relo-
cate your index and keep it functional.
The PDX file you load as your search index file is a small file that creates the information in the IDX 
and .info files. The IDX files contain the actual index entries the end user accesses during a search. 
When you build an index, rebuild an index, or purge data from an index, the maintenance operation 
may or may not affect the PDX file and/or IDX files depending on which option you choose. For 
specific information related to how these files are affected during index creation and maintenance, 
see the following pages for building, rebuilding, and purging index files.

186
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
Purging data
As indexes are maintained and rebuilt, you will need to perform periodic maintenance and purge 
old data. A purge does not delete the index file, nor does it completely rewrite the file; it simply 
recovers the space used in the index for outdated information. Purging is particularly useful when 
you remove PDF files from a folder and the search items are no longer needed. If you have built a 
file several times, each build marks words for deletion. A purge eliminates the marked data and 
reduces the file size. With a significant number of words marked for deletion, a purge will improve 
the speed when using Search. This operation might be scheduled routinely in environments where 
many changes occur within the indexed folders.
TIP
TIP
When changing options for eliminating words and numbers from indexes or adding 
tags and custom properties in the Options dialog box, first open the index.pdx file 
in Catalog and purge the data. Set your new criteria in the Options dialog box and rebuild the 
index. Any items deleted will now be added to the index, or any items you want to eliminate will 
subsequently be eliminated from the index.
Setting Catalog preferences
Catalog preference settings are contained in the Preferences dialog box. Choose Edit ➪ Preferences 
and click the Catalog item in the left pane as shown in Figure 6.27. Notice that the Index Defaults 
items use the same settings as found in the Options dialog box from the New Index Selection dia-
log box. The top three options under Indexing in Catalog preferences are obtained only here in 
these preference settings.

Indexing
The four options found in the Indexing section of the Catalog preferences are as follows:
n Allow indexing on separate drives. When creating index files where you want to include 
folders on network servers and/or computers on your network, select this item in the 
Catalog preferences. The indexing option includes indexing files only on local networks. 
Unfortunately, you can’t index files on Web servers and use indexes from within Web 
browsers.
n Force ISO 9660 compatibility on folders. This setting is a flag that tells Catalog to look 
for any folders that are not compliant with standard DOS conventions (eight-character 
maximum with three-character maximum extensions) for folder/directory names. If 
Catalog encounters a folder name that is not acceptable, the processing stops and an error 
is reported in the Catalog dialog box. Folder names and directory paths are listed for all 
incompatible names. You can review the list and manually rename folders. After changing 
folder names, try to create the index again.
n Enable logging. A log file is created during an index build that describes the processing 
for each file indexed. The file is ASCII text and can be opened in any text editor or word 
processor. Any errors occurring during the build are noted in the log file. All documents 
and directory paths are also contained in the log file. If you don’t want to have a log file 
created at the time of indexing, clear the check box to disable the logging. When you 
disable logging, you are prevented from analyzing problems when you close the Catalog 
dialog box.
n Allow Catalog batch files (.bpdx) to be run. Permits batch processing of index files.
Index defaults
The options listed in the Index Defaults area of the Catalog preferences are identical to the options 
you have available in the New Index Description Options dialog box described earlier in this chap-
ter. These default/options settings exist in two locations for different reasons.
When you set the options in the Preferences dialog box, the options are used for all index files you 
create. When you elect to use the options from the New Index Selection Options dialog box, the 
settings are specific to the index file you create. When you create a new index file, the options 
return to defaults.
If you set a preference in the Catalog preferences and disable the option in the New Index Selection 
Options dialog box, the latter supersedes the former. That is to say, the New Index Selection Options 
dialog box settings always prevail.
Using Index Files
As I stated earlier, one reason you create index files is for speed. When you search hundreds or 
thousands of pages, the amount of time to return found instances for searched words in index files 
is a matter of seconds compared to searching folders in the Search window.

Welcome to Adobe Acrobat

Loading index files
To search using an index file, you need to first load the index in the Search window. From the 
Look In pull-down menu, choose the Select Index menu option, as shown in Figure 6.28.
The Index Selection dialog box opens after you make the menu selection. Click the Add button 
and the Open Index File dialog box opens. In this dialog box navigate your hard drive to find the 
folder where your index file is located. Click the index filename and click the Open button.
After selecting the index to load, you are returned to the Index Selection dialog box. A list of all 
loaded indexes appears in the dialog box. To the left of each filename is a check box. When a 
check mark is in view, the index file is active and can be searched. Those check boxes that are dis-
abled have the index file loaded, but the file remains inactive. Search will not return results from 
the inactive index files. If an index file is grayed out as shown in Figure 6.21, the file path has been 
disrupted and Acrobat can’t find the index file or the support files associated with the index. If you 
see a filename grayed out, select the file in the list and click the Remove button. Click the Add but-
ton and relocate the index. If the support files are not found, an error is reported in a dialog box 
indicating the index file could not be opened.
 FIGURE 6.28
Your first step in using indexes is to load the index file(s) by choosing the Select Index menu option from 
the Look In menu in the Search window.

189

If you can’t open a file, you need to return to the Catalog dialog box and click the Open button. 
Find the index file that you want to make active and rebuild the index. After rebuilding, you need 
to return to the Index selection dialog box and reload the index.
NOTE
NOTE
If you attempt to load an index file from a CD-ROM and the CD is not inserted into 
your CD-ROM drive, the index filename is grayed out in the Index Selection dialog 
box. After inserting the CD-ROM containing the index, the index filename becomes active. If 
you know index files are loaded from CDs, don’t delete them from the Index Selection dialog 
box. Doing so requires you to reload the index file each time you insert a CD.
Attaching an index file to a document
You can associate an index file with a particular document. Open the Document Properties dialog 
box (Ctrl/Ô+D) and click the Advanced tab. Adjacent to the Search Index item is a Browse button. 
Click Browse and the Open dialog box appears. Navigate your hard drive to locate the index file 
created from a folder containing your document, select it, and click Open. When you save your file 
and reopen it, you can select Currently Selected Indexes in the Look In pull-down menu and your 
associated index file is automatically loaded for you.
Disabling indexes
If an index is to be eliminated from searches, you can deactivate the index by disabling its check 
box. In a later Acrobat session, you can go back and enable indexes listed in the Index Selection 
dialog box. You should always use this method rather than deleting an index if you intend to use 
it again in a later Acrobat session. However, at times you may want to delete an index file. If the 
index will no longer be used, or you relocate your index to another drive or server, you may want 
to completely remove the old index. If this is the case, select the index file to be deleted and click 
the Remove button. Indexes may be enabled or disabled before you select Remove. In either case, 
the index file is removed without warning.
If you inadvertently delete an index, you can always reload the index by clicking the Add button. 
Placing index files in a directory where you can easily access them is a good idea. To avoid confu-
sion, try to keep indexes in a common directory or a directory together with the indexed PDF files. 
Acrobat doesn’t care where the index file is located on your hard drive or server — it just needs to 
know where the file is located and the file needs to keep the relative path with the support files. If 
you move the index file to a different directory, be certain to reestablish the connection in the 
Index Selection dialog box.
Finding index information
When a number of index files are installed on a computer or server, the names for the files may not 
be descriptive enough to determine which index you want to search. If more detailed information 
is desired, the information provided by the Index Information dialog box may help identify the 
index needed for a given search.

Welcome to Adobe Acrobat

PDF WORKFLOW
PDF WORKFLOW Index information may be particularly helpful in office environments where several 
people in different departments create PDFs and indexes are all placed on a com-
mon server. What may be intuitive to the author of an index file in terms of index name may not 
be as intuitive to other users. Index information offers the capability for adding more descriptive 
information that can be understood by many users.
Fortunately, you can explore more descriptive information about an index file by clicking the Info 
button in the Index Selection dialog box. When you click the Info button, the Index information 
dialog box opens, displaying information about the index file, as shown earlier in Figure 6.22. 
Some of the information displayed requires user entry at the time the index is built. Acrobat 
Catalog automatically creates other information in the dialog box when the index is built. The 
Index information dialog box provides a description of the following:
n Title. The user supplies title information at the time the index is created. Titles usually 
consist of several words describing the index contents. Titles can be searched, as detailed 
earlier in this chapter, so the title keywords should reflect the index content.
n Description. Description can be a few words or several sentences containing information 
about the index. (In Figure 6.22, the description was supplied in Acrobat Catalog when 
the index was created.)
n Filename. The directory path for the index file’s location on a drive or server is displayed 
with the last item appearing as the index filename.
n Last built. If the index file is updated, the date of the last build is supplied here. If no 
updates have occurred, the date will be the same as the created date.
n Created. This date reflects the time and date the index file was originally created, and is 
therefore a fixed date.
n Documents. Indexes are created from one or more PDF documents. The total number of 
PDF files from which the index file was created appears here.
n Status. If the index file has been identified and added to the list in the Index Selection 
dialog box, it will be Available. Unavailable indexes appear grayed out in the list and are 
described as Unavailable.
Searching an index
After your index file(s) is prepared and loaded in the Index selection dialog box, it is ready for use. 
You search index files in the Advanced Search window just as you search multiple files as explained 
earlier in this chapter. From the Look In pull-down menu, select Currently Selected Indexes.
All the options discussed earlier for advanced searches are available to you. Select from the Return 
results containing pull-down menu, enter your search criteria, and select the options you want. 
Click the Search button and you’ll find the search results reported much faster than using other 
search methods.
Index files can be created from PDF collections contained on external media where the index file 
can remain on your computer without the need for copying the PDF documents to your hard 

191
Searching PDF Files

drive. When you insert a media disk such as a CD-ROM, your search index is ready to use to search 
the media.
Practice searching your new index file using different options and search criteria. To compare the 
difference between using a search index file and using the advanced search options, you can choose 
the Browse for Location menu item and search the CD-ROM for the same criteria. Go back and 
forth to see the differences between searching folders and searching an index file.
Searching external devices
A computer network server, another computer on your network, a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, external 
hard drive, and a removable media cartridge are considered external to your local computer hard 
drive(s). Any of these devices can be indexed and the index file can be located on any of the devices 
you index. If you want to save an index file on a device different from where the PDF collection is 
stored, you need to be certain to open the Preferences dialog box for the Catalog preferences and 
enable the check box for Allow indexing on separate drives. This preference setting enables you to 
index across media devices.
NOTE
NOTE
When you want to write index files to read only media such as CD-ROMs and 
DVDs, you need to create the index file from PDFs stored on your hard drive. After 
the index file is created, copy the index file, the supporting files, and the PDFs to your media 
and burn the disc.
When you want to search an index, you can activate the index in the Index selection dialog box 
and invoke a search whether your external media is mounted and accessible or not. The search 
index returns results from the index .pdx file and the .idx files without looking at the PDFs that 
were indexed. You can examine the results of the search in the Search window and find the files 
where the search criteria match the PDF documents in the index collection.
If you want to open the link to the PDF document where a result is reported, you need to have the 
media mounted and accessible. If a network server or other computer contains the related files, 
the server/computer must be shared with appropriate permissions and visible on your desktop. If 
you use external media storage devices, the media must be mounted and visible on your desktop 
in order to view the PDFs linked to the search results. If you attempt to view a document when the 
device is not mounted, Acrobat opens an error dialog box.
If you see an error dialog box, click OK in the dialog box and insert your media, connect an exter-
nal hard drive, or access a computer or network server. You don’t need to quit Acrobat to make 
your device accessible. Wait until the media is mounted and then click a search result. Acrobat 
opens the linked page and you’re ready to continue your search.
A search index file created on one computer can be moved or copied to another computer. To copy 
an index file to another computer, be certain you copy the index file (.pdx) and all supporting files 
in the folder created by Catalog. Be certain you maintain the same relative directory path for the 
index file and the supporting files. If an index file appears in a root folder and the supporting files 
appear in a nested folder, copy the root folder to other media. If you place the index file in the 
same folder as the supporting files, copy the single folder containing all files to your media.

192
Welcome to Adobe Acrobat
Part I
You can load the index file and external media on another computer and perform the same searches 
as were performed where the index file was created. When distributing CD-ROMs and DVDs you can 
copy these index files to your media and all users can access the index files. If you access an index 
file on a network server and the PDF collection is stored on an external device such as a CD-ROM, 
you cannot open files from another computer unless the CD-ROM is mounted. You may see your 
network server, but the associated devices with the server need to be individually mounted in order 
to open PDF files remotely.
Working with Embedded Index Files
Index files can be scattered all over your hard drive and, at times, it can be a chore to load them in 
the Index selection dialog box. In addition, when sharing PDFs where indexes have been created 
requires you to either attach an index file to a PDF or send along your index to recipients of your 
PDFs. Again, the steps involved can be aggravating if you have to spend time finding the index files 
on your hard drive.
Acrobat 8 simplified the steps for loading index files and sharing them. In Acrobat 8 and 9 you 
can embed an index file in PDFs. Embedding an index file is limited to a single PDF document or 
a PDF Portfolio and not a collection of PDFs. You won’t gain any better performance embedding 
indexes in one-page PDFs or files containing few pages.
When you embed an index file you bypass all the steps for creating an index using Acrobat Catalog. 
Indexes are automatically created and embedded by Acrobat Pro and Acrobat Pro Extended through 
a simple button click in a dialog box.
To understand more about creating an index file and embedding it in a PDF document, follow 
these steps.
STEPS: Creating and embedding index files
 
1. Open a PDF document in Acrobat Pro. Try to find a PDF having 500 or more pages or 
a PDF Portfolio. Longer documents make index embedding more practical when using 
this feature. In this example I use a file containing 803 pages.
 
2. Open the Manage Embedded Index dialog box. Select Advanced ➪ Document 
Processing ➪ Manage Embedded Index. The Manage Embedded Index dialog box opens, 
as shown in Figure 6.29.
 
3. Embed the Index. Click the Embed Index button in the Manage Embedded Index 
dialog box.
 
4. Click OK. Click OK after Acrobat completes the index creation and your new index file 
is now embedded in your PDF. (See Figure 6.30.)

193

 FIGURE 6.29
Select Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Manage Embedded Index.
 FIGURE 6.30
Click OK and your index is embedded in the PDF.
 
5. Compare a search using the embedded index. Open the original PDF without an index 
embedded in the document and press Ctrl/Ô+Shift+F to open the Search window. Select 
The Current PDF in the Look In pull-down menu and search for a work in the document. 
Notice the amount of time it takes to search all pages in the file.
 
 Bring the file with the embedded index forward in the Document pane or open the file if 
you closed it. Perform a search using the Current Document option in the Look In pull-
down menu. Add the same search criteria in the Search window and search the document. 
You should see a noticeable difference in the speed for the returned results.

Summary
n Acrobat 9 viewers include a Find toolbar used for searching the current active document.
n Searching PDF files occurs in the Search window. When a search is requested, the Search 
window opens as a floating window.
n The Search window enables basic and advanced searches.
n Basic searches are used to search open PDF files but provide more options than the Find 
command.
n Advanced searches enable searching multiple PDFs locally, on external media, and across 
networks with the use of a search index file.
n Acrobat viewers 6.0 and greater support searching content of bookmarks and comments 
through advanced searches and index file searches. Acrobat 7.0 through 9 supports 
searching file attachments.
n Searches for PDFs on the Internet are no longer built into Acrobat. If you want to search 
for PDFs on the Internet, you need to use a Web search engine that supports searching for 
PDFs.
n Searches can be made with a variety of options, including Boolean queries, without the 
use of an index file.
n Search index files are created in Acrobat Catalog in Acrobat Pro or Acrobat Pro Extended 
only. Searching index files returns results for large collections of PDFs much faster than 
basic and advanced searches.
n Document descriptions can be searched with advanced searches and via index file searches.
n Index files can be built, rebuilt, and purged with Acrobat Catalog. Old index files created 
with PDF formats earlier than version 6.0 need to be rebuilt with Acrobat Catalog. Acrobat 
Catalog 9 index files are backward-compatible with Acrobat 6.0.
n Tags, XMP data, and object data can be searched with advanced searches and from index 
searches.
n Index files can be copied to other computers, network servers, and external media storage 
units. When copying search indexes, you need to duplicate all supporting files and the 
relative directory path(s) on the destination units.
n Index files can be embedded on a PDF-by-PDF basis in Acrobat 8 and 9. A single menu 
command creates and embeds an index in a PDF opened in the Document pane.

T
his section deals with converting documents from author-
ing programs to PDF files that can be opened, viewed, 
and edited in Acrobat Standard (Windows), Acrobat 
Professional (Windows and Macintosh), and Acrobat Professional 
Extended (Windows). In Chapter 7 you find all the options avail-
able for converting files to PDF from within Acrobat. Chapter 8 
is dedicated to using the PDFMaker installed with your Acrobat 
installation for converting Microsoft Office files. In Chapter 9 
I talk about using many Adobe programs that support direct 
export to PDF, and in Chapter 10 you find everything you need 
to know about using Adobe Acrobat Distiller to convert PostScript 
files to PDF.

U
nlike almost every other computer program, Acrobat was never 
designed to support creating new files and editing pages to add 
content. Where Acrobat begins is with file conversion to the PDF 
format. Users start with a document authored in another program and the 
resulting document is converted to PDF using either tools from within Acrobat 
or tools or commands within programs that support PDF conversion from 
native documents.
With Acrobat Standard and Acrobat Pro, and Acrobat Pro Extended, the num-
ber of methods you can employ for converting documents to PDF is enormous. 
Any program file can be converted to PDF through a number of different 
methods offered by Acrobat, operating systems, and many different authoring 
applications. The method you use to convert a document to PDF and the 
purpose for which the PDF is intended require you to become familiar with 
a number of different options at your disposal for PDF file creation. This 
chapter begins a new part of the book entirely devoted to PDF creation. In 
this chapter you learn basic PDF conversion methods available in Acrobat 
Pro and Acrobat Standard. The following chapters in this part cover more 
advanced PDF creation methods.
For easier reading in this chapter, I’ll refer to Acrobat Pro (Windows and 
Macintosh) and Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows only) simply as Acrobat 
Pro. Where a different feature is exclusive to Acrobat Pro Extended, I’ll so 
state that the feature is exclusive to Acrobat Pro Extended.

Setting Up the PDF Creation Environment
You create PDF documents from within Acrobat with default tools and with menu commands. In 
addition to the default tools, this chapter makes use of the Snapshot tool, the Edit toolbar, and the 
Create PDF From Web Page tool in the File toolbar. To regain the default toolbars, open a context 
menu on the Toolbar Well and select Reset Toolbars from the menu commands or press Alt/
Option+F8.
Open the More Tools menu from a context menu on the Toolbar Well. Scroll down to the Advanced 
Editing toolbar and check the box adjacent to the toolbar name. Scroll down the window to the 
Select & Zoom toolbar. Check the box for the Snapshot tool.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
I’ll talk about converting Flash files in this chapter, which is a new feature in Acrobat 9. 
In addition to menu commands, Acrobat 9 has introduced some new tools for han-
dling Flash imports. Open a context menu on the Acrobat Toolbar Well and choose Multimedia. 
The Multimedia toolbar contains the new Flash tool.
If you intend to edit documents after PDF creation, you need to open toolbars specific to your edit-
ing session. Depending on the type of edits you anticipate, open toolbars as needed after you finish 
converting files to PDF. For this chapter, click OK in the More Tools window and select Dock 
Toolbars from a context menu opened on the Toolbar Well.
Understanding How PDFs Are Created
You can use Acrobat to open various file formats in the viewer; the files are immediately converted 
to PDF. You can also print a file to the Adobe PDF printer, installed with your viewer, from just 
about any authoring program, and the native document is converted to PDF. It all sounds like 
simple stuff, but two very important distinctions exist between these methods of conversion for 
certain file types that you need to understand before you start converting files to PDF. Quite sim-
ply, opening some files in Acrobat Pro or Acrobat Standard does not involve any intervention 
from companion programs. On the other hand, using some file formats and using the Adobe PDF 
printer requires some help from the Acrobat Distiller software. To understand the fundamentals of 
document conversion you need to know a little bit about Acrobat Distiller.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
Acrobat Distiller is thoroughly covered in Chapter 10, where you’ll find information 
on setting all the options Distiller offers you.
Acrobat Distiller accepts either a PostScript file or an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file that it pro-
cesses to produce a PDF document. Through the processing mechanism, Distiller applies different 
options during conversion. These options can include image sampling, font handling, color con-
trol, PDF format compatibility assignment, document encryption, hypertext linking, and a host of 
other settings. Each of the settings is designed to produce PDF files for different purposes. Because 
so many different options can be applied to PDF conversion via the Distiller software, Distiller pro-
vides you the capability to save an assortment of specific settings to individual Adobe PDF Settings 
files. When you save the files to a specific location on your hard drive, you can access them from 

199
Converting Files to PDF

a pull-down menu in Acrobat Distiller or from within authoring programs where Adobe PDF 
Settings are used.
NOTE
NOTE
Adobe PDF Settings were referred to as Job Options prior to Acrobat 6.
In addition to custom settings, you can save to Adobe PDF Settings files. Acrobat Distiller, when 
installed with Acrobat Pro or Acrobat Pro Extended, has nine settings, and Acrobat Standard has 
five settings. When you create a PDF file that calls upon Distiller to produce the PDF document, 
the Adobe PDF Settings last used by Distiller control the options for your resulting PDF document. 
The danger here is that if you intend to have a file created for printing, for example, and the set-
tings are optimized for screen viewing, you wind up with a PDF document that won’t be suitable 
for printing. Therefore, it is imperative that you know what settings are applied to PDFs created 
with the Acrobat Distiller software.
Prior to the conversion process you’ll have an opportunity to make a choice for the Adobe PDF 
Settings that are applied during distillation. These choices may or may not be available depend-
ing on the type of files you convert to PDF. If the Adobe PDF Settings are not made available 
when you convert to PDF, the default settings in Acrobat Distiller are used. You need to be cer-
tain you open Acrobat Distiller and change the defaults when conversion of a particular file type 
does not open Acrobat Distiller. Regardless of where you access the settings choices, the same 
options are always available. If you haven’t saved any custom settings, the defaults appear as 
shown in Figure 7.1.
 FIGURE 7.1
The default Adobe PDF Settings are selectable from a pull-down menu in the Acrobat Distiller window in 
Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended. Acrobat Standard does not have PDF/X and PDF/A options.

For a complete description of the Adobe PDF Settings, see Chapter 10.
 
In this chapter, we’ll look at using the High Quality, Press Quality, Smallest File Size, and Standard 
settings. Without an elaborate definition of these settings, for the purposes of this chapter, think of 
High Quality for business office printing, Press Quality as suited for commercial printing, Smallest 
File Size as suited for Web hosting and screen viewing, and the Standard settings as suited for 
everything else.
Converting Native Documents to PDF
Many authoring programs offer you methods for converting to PDF, such as exporting or saving 
to PDF directly, or using a utility installed with Acrobat that supports certain authoring programs. 
However, when these methods are not available you can use the Print command in your authoring 
program to produce a PDF document. Virtually any document created in an authoring program that 
allows printing can be converted to PDF through the use of the Adobe PDF printer (Windows and 
Mac OS X 10.2 and above).
You access the Adobe PDF printer in the application Print dialog box. Rather than print a file to a 
printer, you print your file to disk. During this process, the file is temporarily saved as a PostScript 
file and the PostScript file is distilled in Acrobat Distiller. The Adobe PDF Settings assigned to 
Distiller control the attributes of the resulting PDF file. The process is relatively the same on both 
Windows and Macintosh platforms, but initial printer selection and dialog box selections vary a 
little.
Adobe PDF printer (Windows)
When you install Acrobat, the Adobe PDF printer is installed in your Printers folder. As a printer 
driver, the file is accessible from any program capable of printing, including your computer acces-
sories and utilities. Like any other printer you install on Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4, 
Windows XP Professional, Windows XP Home Edition, or Tablet PC with Service Pack 2, you can 
set the Adobe PDF printer as the default printer. Once you have set the default printer, you don’t 
need to make a printer selection each time you want to create a PDF document.
NOTE
NOTE
You may also have the Acrobat Distiller printer installed in your Printer’s 
folder. The features associated with the Adobe PDF printer and the 
Acrobat Distiller printer are identical.
To convert any application document to PDF, choose File ➪ Print or access the Print dialog box 
with the menu command in your authoring program. Some dedicated vertical market programs, 
such as accounting and other office programs, may have print commands located in menus other 
than the File menu. When you arrive at the Print dialog box, the various printer drivers installed 
on your computer are shown. Select the Adobe PDF printer in the Print dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 7.2.

 FIGURE 7.2
From any authoring program, select the Print command, select the Adobe PDF printer, and click OK to 
convert the open document to a PDF file.
Before printing to the Adobe PDF printer, check your output options by clicking the Preferences 
button. In Windows 2000 and earlier, you will see Properties appear in the Print dialog box. If you 
see Properties, click the Properties button. The Adobe PDF Document Properties dialog box opens, 
as shown in Figure 7.3. In this dialog box you choose options for the resulting PDF document. 
Click the Adobe PDF Settings tab to choose the PDF options.

Choices you can make about the PDF file and handling the PDF conversion are contained in the 
Adobe PDF Settings window. Items you’ll want to control include the following:
n Default Settings. This item relates to the discussion in the previous section concerning 
the Acrobat Distiller Adobe PDF Settings. The choices you have from the pull-down menu 
are the same nine preset choices (Acrobat Pro and Pro extended) or four choices (Acrobat 
Standard) provided with your Acrobat installation and any custom settings, if you’ve cre-
ated them. It’s important to make the proper choice for the options you want. When you 
print to the Adobe PDF printer, Acrobat Distiller is used in the background and applies 
the settings you specify in this dialog box.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For a better understanding of Adobe PDF Settings, see Chapter 10.
n Adobe PDF Security. If you want to password-protect your document, you can apply 
security settings at the time the PDF is created. Choose the security options from the 
choices in the pull-down menu. The default choice for None results in PDF documents 
created without any password protection.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
To learn how to apply password protection to PDF documents, see Chapter 26.
n Adobe PDF Output Folder. Choose to save PDF files to a fixed folder and directory path 
or be prompted for a filename and directory path for the saved file.
n Adobe PDF Page Size. A pull-down menu offers an extensive list of page sizes derived 
from the printer driver and not the PPD (PostScript Printer Description file) for your 
printer. If you don’t have a custom size that matches your document page, click the Add 
button adjacent to the Adobe PDF Page Size pull-down menu. The Add Custom Paper 
Size dialog box opens where you make choices for the custom page size and add the new 
page option in the pull-down menu, as shown in Figure 7.4.
 FIGURE 7.4
The Add Custom Paper Size dialog box enables you to create a page size up to 200 × 
200 inches.

Acrobat accepts sizes up to 200 × 200 inches (5,080 × 5,080 millimeters/14,400 × 
14,400 points). Enter your new custom page size in the units of measure desired and 
click the Add/Modify button. Your new page size is added to the Adobe PDF Page Size 
pull-down menu and selected for you after you click the Add/Modify button. If you want 
to delete a page after it has been created, click Add in the Printing Preferences dialog box 
and select the page you want to delete from the Add Custom Paper Size dialog box. Click 
the Delete button and the page is deleted from both pull-down menus. Clicking Cancel 
(or pressing the Esc key) in the dialog box returns you to the Adobe PDF Document 
Properties dialog box without affecting any changes.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
Setting custom pages for the Adobe PDF Printer makes the custom page sizes 
accessible for this printer driver only. If using other methods for PDF creation such 
as using the PDFMaker tools in Office programs, you’ll want to create custom page sizes in 
another preferences dialog box. For more information on creating custom page sizes and 
Microsoft Office programs, see Chapter 8.
n View Adobe PDF results. When the check box is enabled, the resulting PDF document 
opens in the Acrobat Document pane. If Acrobat is not open, the program launches after 
the PDF is created.
n Add document information. This item is a little misleading. You are not prompted in a 
dialog box to add document information. However, when using applications that support 
certain kinds of document information such as document title and author, the information 
from the native document is added to the Document Properties Description fields. The 
document properties in your native document are not translated precisely, though. You 
may have a Word file with custom properties set up in the Word Document Properties 
dialog box like a Title, Subject, Author, Keywords, and so on. When the Word file is con-
verted to PDF, you’ll find your Title information in Acrobat to be the name of the saved 
Word file and the Author is your computer log-on name. Regardless of the custom prop-
erties you add to the Document Properties text boxes in Word, the results in Acrobat 
default to descriptions you can’t control. If you remove the check box for this setting, all 
the Document Properties Descriptions in the PDF file are blank.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on document descriptions, see Chapter 6.
n Rely on system fonts only; do not use document fonts. What this check box does is 
control whether fonts are put into the PostScript stream that are sent to the Adobe PDF 
printer. Since 99.9% of the time those fonts are resident on your system, there is no value 
in having them also embedded in the PostScript stream; it just makes the process of 
printing to Adobe PDF slower. By default, the check box is ON — it’s faster. Leave this 
setting at the default.

written to a log file in the form of ASCII text. You can open the log file in any text editor 
and review the steps used to produce the PDF. Each time a PDF is successfully created, 
the log file is deleted. In the event you want to review the PDF creation process logged 
in the text file, disable the check box and open the log file in a text editor.
n Ask to replace existing PDF file. If you elect to not have Acrobat prompt you for a file-
name, the PDF file is created using the authoring document filename. If you make changes 
in the document and want to create a new PDF document, the second creation overwrites 
the first file if the check box is disabled. If you’re creating different versions of PDF files 
and want to have them all saved to disk, be certain to enable the check box.
After you review all the options in the Adobe PDF Printing Preferences dialog box, click OK. You 
are returned to the Print dialog box and are ready to create the PDF document. Click Print in the 
dialog box and the PDF is produced with the options you chose in the Adobe PDF Settings dialog 
box. If the check box was enabled for View Adobe PDF results, the PDF opens in Acrobat.
Because this method of PDF creation uses a printer driver, you can create a PDF document from 
virtually any application program. The only requirement is that the program is capable of printing. 
If you use programs such as Microsoft Office, other Adobe programs, certain CAD drawing pro-
grams, high-end imaging programs, or a host of other applications, you may have other methods 
for creating PDF documents depending on the level of PDF support for the program. It is important 
to understand when to use the Adobe PDF printer and other methods available to you from different 
applications. Before you integrate using the Adobe PDF printer into your workflow, be certain to 
review the next two chapters because they discuss other options for creating PDF documents.

Adobe PDF (Macintosh OS X)
Mac OS X and Adobe PDF are married at the operating system level and you can find several ways 
to convert your authoring files to the PDF format. The Acrobat-supported method uses the same 
type of printer driver you find on Windows. From any authoring program, select the Print command 
(most commonly accessed by choosing File ➪ Print). When the Print dialog box opens, select 
Adobe PDF 9.0 from the Printer pull-down menu. From the default selection for Copies and Pages, 
open the pull-down menu and select PDF Options, as shown in Figure 7.5.
The dialog box changes so that you can access Adobe PDF Settings from a pull-down menu. The 
default selection is Use Default. If you leave this option active, the most recent settings selected in 
the Distiller application are used to produce the PDF file. The remaining options are the same as 
those discussed for Windows users. When you add new custom settings, they appear in the Adobe 
PDF Settings pull-down menus from the Print dialog boxes on Windows and Macintosh operating 
systems.

 FIGURE 7.5
PDF Options settings are available after you select the PDF Options pull-down menu command.
Another setting for viewing the PDF file appears in the pull-down menu: After PDF Creation. You 
can choose to view your PDF in the default Acrobat viewer or leave the default at Launch Nothing, 
which allows you to go about your work and view the PDFs later. After you choose the settings, 
click the Print button to convert the file to PDF using the Adobe PDF Settings you selected from 
the menu choices.
If you open the PDF pull-down menu at the bottom of the dialog box and select Save as PDF (see 
Figure 7.6), you create a PDF using the PDF engine built into Mac OS X. Checking this option also 
creates a PDF file, but the PDF creation is not an Adobe-based PDF creation method. This menu 
choice appears in a generic installation of Mac OS X (Jaguar through Leopard), and creating a PDF 
this way is supported by the operating system without the use of Acrobat Distiller. When you use 
Save As PDF, the PDF is created using the native Mac OS X PDF creation tools, which provides 
adequate PDF creation of non-prepress documents. The PDF documents created using this method 
will work fine for office uses; however, they will be significantly larger than those created by Adobe 
Acrobat.

Save As PDF was designed by Apple to provide users with a PDF version of a document to send to 
people across the Internet for screen viewing and desktop printing. As a matter of practice, using 
the Adobe PDF printer is your best choice for creating PDFs suited for purposes other than screen 
displays.

CAUTION 
CAUTION
A number of different clone printer drivers and clone PDF creators are distributed 
from developers and enthusiasts. Using a clone product can often produce unreli-
able PDF documents. If you purchased Adobe Acrobat, be sure to use the tools Adobe has pro-
vided you for PDF creation. Adobe and many Adobe partners that have licensed Adobe 
technology offer you the best results for reliable PDF creation.
When to Use the Adobe PDF Printer driver
On Windows you use the Adobe PDF Printer for authoring applications that don’t support exports 
to PDF. Programs such as the Microsoft Office applications, Autodesk AutoCAD, Lotus Notes, and 
so on offer you better options for converting directly to PDF via tools installed with your Acrobat 
installation. Simple text editor documents, vertical market application programs such as account-
ing programs, shareware programs, and other types of application documents not normally used 
for professional design purposes are likely candidates for using the Adobe PDF Printer driver. If a 
program such as a Microsoft Office application supports direct exports to PDF, you’re always best 
served by using the export tools Adobe provides you when you install Acrobat.
Macintosh users will find a much more liberal use for the Adobe PDF Printer. Inasmuch as there 
are some export options for programs like Microsoft Office programs, they generally don’t work as 
well as using the Print dialog box and printing to a PDF document. Additionally programs like

A
pple’s OS X also supports an Apple-developed PDF viewer called Preview. By default, double-
clicking a PDF file opens the PDF in the Preview application. If you want to change the default 
viewer from Preview to Acrobat, select a PDF document and press Ô+I to open the Document Info 
dialog box, as shown in the following figure.
From the Open with menu, select Adobe Acrobat Pro (or the viewer you want to establish as the 
default PDF viewer). Click the Change All button and all your PDF documents will open by default 
in Acrobat.
continued
Safari, Firefox, and Apple Mail don’t have the same support for PDF creation as you find on 
Windows with Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Outlook. Unless you’re using the Adobe 
Creative Suite applications, almost all other application documents on the Mac are best converted 
to PDF using the Print dialog box.

Creating Blank New Pages
Sometimes features added to programs are hidden in a menu command and may be undocumented. 
When Acrobat 7 was introduced, a menu command was added to create a new PDF document from 
within Acrobat. I missed this addition in Acrobat 7 because it was so obscure and it never occurred 
to me that the command existed.
To create a blank new page in Acrobat 7, press the Shift key on your keyboard and select 
File ➪ Create PDF ➪ From Blank Page.
In Acrobat 8 a menu command was introduced to create a blank new page via the File ➪ Create 
PDF submenu. In Acrobat 9 you find the same File ➪ Create PDF ➪ From Blank Page command to 
create a new blank page.
continued
If you’re using Mac OS X Leopard, you have another method for viewing PDF documents with Apple’s 
QuickLook feature. Click a PDF document on the desktop or within a folder and press the Spacebar. 
The PDF document pops up on the desktop with the first page in view. You can scroll all pages in a 
PDF file using QuickLook by dragging the slider on the right side of the window up or down.

Note that you must select the File ➪ Create PDF menu command for From Blank Page to appear as 
shown in Figure 7.7. Using the Create task button menu won’t get you the option to create a new 
document. When you select the command, a single-page PDF is created. The page appears as a 
portrait standard letter-size page by default.

The blank page created appears with a default text box and a special toolbar used for setting type 
attributes for the text added to the text box. In addition, you have some preference options for 
selecting different page sizes, page orientation, and margins that define the size of the text box in 
the New Document preferences.

Creating PDFs from Files
Adobe Acrobat offers you a number of options for converting application documents to PDF. For 
PDF creation supported by Acrobat, you don’t need to leave the program to produce PDF files 
from a number of different file formats.
 
 The Create task button pull-down menu offers a few different options for PDF creation, as 
 shown in Figure 7.8 (left). If you choose File ➪ Create PDF you find many more options for 
converting documents to PDF as shown in Figure 7.8 (right).

 FIGURE 7.8
The Create task button (left) offers a few options for PDF file creation. Choose File ➪ Create PDF (right) and 
you find many more options for PDF file creation from within Acrobat.
You use Create PDF ➪ From File to convert any file format supported by Acrobat to a PDF document. 
You can also use File ➪ Open to convert to PDF. If using the Open dialog box, be certain to choose 
All Files (*.*) from the Files of Type pull-down menu (Windows) or Show pull-down menu (Mac).
TIP
TIP
You can also convert any file compatible with the Create PDF ➪ From File menu 
command by dragging a document on top of the Acrobat window.
Supported file formats
To convert files to PDF from within Acrobat, you first need to understand all the supported formats. 
You can try to convert any file format to PDF with the Create PDF tool. If the file format is supported, 
the document is converted to PDF and opens in Acrobat. If the format is not supported, a dialog 
box opens informing you the format is not supported. It won’t hurt to try, but knowing ahead of 
time what formats are supported is better.
Many file formats that are acceptable to Acrobat can also have conversion settings defined by you. 
Options for the conversion settings are the same as you have available with the Adobe PDF printer, 
as discussed earlier in this chapter, and they’re accessible in the Preferences dialog box. Before you 
begin converting files to PDF with the Create PDF tool, be certain to choose Edit ➪ Preferences 
(Windows) or Acrobat ➪ Preferences (Macintosh) or use (Ctrl/Ô+K) and click the Convert To PDF 
item in the left pane. On the right side of the Preferences dialog box, you’ll see a list of supported 
file formats, as shown in Figure 7.9 for Windows and Figure 7.10 for the Macintosh. As you can 
see at a quick glance, the Macintosh doesn’t support as many file format conversions as Windows.
NOTE
NOTE
Figure 7.9 shows file formats supported in Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows only). 
CAD formats such as 3D Studio Mesh, 3DXML, ACIS, CADDS, CATIA, CGR, 
Collada, I-DEAS, and so on are not supported in Acrobat Pro.

When using the Create PDF tool, you assign PDF Settings to different file formats in the Convert To PDF 
preferences. The Preferences dialog box lists all supported file formats in the Convert To PDF preferences.
 FIGURE 7.10
Fewer file formats are supported on the Macintosh.
The file formats that are supported by Acrobat Pro (excluding those CAD formats supported by 
Acrobat Pro Extended) include the following:
n Autodesk AutoCAD (Windows only). Autodesk’s AutoCAD files can be opened in 
Acrobat directly. Layered files are preserved and opened with data on different layers 
when layer data are created in the AutoCAD file. AutoCAD is also supported with the 
PDFMaker utility, which installs Acrobat tools and menu options in the authoring appli-
cation at the time you install Acrobat.

212

Part II
n BMP. Bitmap is a file format that can be saved from many image-editing programs. Bitmap 
is also commonly referred to as a color mode in Photoshop. As a color mode, the file can 
be saved in other file formats. For example, a 1-bit bitmap image can be saved as a TIFF-
formatted file. In regard to Acrobat, the bitmap file format that is capable of rendering 
images in 1-bit, 4-bit, 8-bit, and 24-bit color depths can be opened as PDF. Furthermore, 
a bitmap color mode saved as any of the compatible formats listed here can also be 
opened as a PDF.
n CompuServe GIF. CompuServe’s Graphic Interchange Format (GIF) was developed years 
ago to port image files to and from mainframes and microcomputers. It remains a popular 
format for Web graphics, and the later version of GIF89a supports interlacing. If using 
Photoshop, you can either save in the CompuServe GIF87 format or use Photoshop’s Save 
for Web command and choose the GIF89a format. Regardless of what format is used, 
Acrobat can import either as a PDF.
n Flash. Flash FLV and SWF (Windows and Macintosh) formats are supported in Acrobat 9.
n HTML. Hypertext Markup Language files are documents written in HTML for Web pages. 
You can open any HTML file and the file and file links convert to PDF. Clicking an HTML 
link in a converted file in Acrobat appends the linked file to the open document.
n InDesign. Adobe InDesign .indd files are supported. Click the Edit Settings button and 
you can choose from all the Adobe PDF Settings used by Acrobat Distiller. Note that 
exporting hyperlinks, interactive features, and layers require exporting from within 
Adobe InDesign.
n JDF Job Definition. You find JDF files in prepress workflows. The resultant PDF produces 
a standardized XML-based job ticket with information about the file for commercial 
printing uses, such as page size, crop and bleed areas, trapping, colorspace, and so on.
n JPEG. Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) images are also used for Web graphics 
and file exchanges on the Internet. JPEG compression is a lossy compression scheme 
that can degrade images rapidly when they are compressed at high levels. These files are 
already compressed. Adding further compression with the PDF conversion options won’t 
compress files smaller than the original compression. Inasmuch as the Settings button is 
active in the Open dialog box, you can’t actually get more compression out of the file 
when converting to PDF.
n JPEG2000. JPEG2000 is a newer compression scheme that also offers a lossless option 
for compressing images. You can use JPEG2000 with lossless compression for the most 
discriminating quality required in high-end printing.
n Microsoft Office (Windows only). Microsoft Office files are from the office programs of 
Excel, PowerPoint, Project, Visio, Word, and Publisher. Each of the Office programs is 
listed separately because you can edit different settings that apply to each respective pro-
gram. On the Mac, Office applications are not supported for conversion within Acrobat.

For information related to settings adjustments with Microsoft Office programs, see 
Chapter 8.

n PCX. PCX files are native to the PC and were commonly used as an extension for PC 
Paintbrush. Adobe Photoshop can export in PCX format, but today it is rarely used for any 
kind of image representation. The advantage you have in opening PCX files in Acrobat is 
when converting legacy files saved in this format. Rather than your having to do a two-step 
operation of opening a PCX file in an image editor and saving in a more common format 
for file conversions, Acrobat can import the files directly.
n PICT (Macintosh only). The native Apple Macintosh equivalent to PCX (preceding bullet) 
is PICT (Picture). Photoshop supports PICT file exchanges in both opening and saving. 
However, Acrobat supports the format for conversion to PDF only via the From File or 
From Multiple Files commands.
n PNG. Portable Network Graphics (PNG — pronounced ping) is a format enabling you 
to save 24-bit color images without compression. The format was designed for Web use 
and is becoming more popular among Web designers. Older Web browsers need a special 
plug-in in order to view the images, which have slowed its wide acceptance. Interestingly 
enough, PNG images are saved from image editors without compression, yet Acrobat can 
apply image compression when converting to PDF. You can use all the compression 
options in the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box with PNG images to reduce file sizes.
n PostScript/EPS. PostScript and EPS files were formerly converted only with Acrobat 
Distiller. In Acrobat 8 you can open the files in Acrobat using the Create PDF tool and 
Distiller works in the background, handling the conversion to PDF.
n Text. Text listed in the Convert to PDF preferences relates to plain text files. Unformatted 
text from word processors, text editors, and any file saved in a text-only format can be 
opened in Acrobat.
n TIFF. Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) is by far the most popular format among the 
print people regardless of platform. TIFF files originate from image editors and scans. 
When scanning text you can save it as a TIFF, import the file in Acrobat, and then con-
vert the image file to rich text with Acrobat’s Text Recognition feature.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on Scan to PDF and Text Recognition, see Chapter 17.
n XPS. XPS (XML Paper Specification) is a paginated representation of an electronic paper 
in an XML-based format. XPS documents can be converted to PDF from within Acrobat 
in Acrobat 8 and 9. The Settings adjustments let you choose from any of the Adobe PDF 
Settings, except the Standards formats such as PDF/A and PDF/X.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more on PDF Standards formats, see Chapters 10 and 32.
Applying settings
Many of the file formats supported by Acrobat can have PDF Options or other settings applied 
during conversion. These settings are available to all formats except CompuServe GIF, HTML, 
JDF Job Definition, JPEG2000, and Text. Depending on the file type to be created, you can edit the 

214
Converting Documents to PDF

settings and apply some different options. You edit settings by selecting a file type from those listed 
in the Preferences dialog box shown in Figure 7.8 and clicking the Edit Settings button. If the set-
tings cannot be adjusted, the Edit Settings button is grayed out.
Settings options for the different file formats include the following:
n Autodesk AutoCAD. AutoCAD files can be converted with bookmarks and links, with 
layers, embedded data, and support for the new Engineering (PDF/E-1) standard as shown 
in Figure 7.11. The Adobe PDF Settings and Security options are also available with 
AutoCAD .dxf conversions. Click the Edit Settings button after selecting a file type to 
open the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box shown in Figure 7.11.
 FIGURE 7.11
The Adobe PDF Settings for Autodesk AutoCAD documents dialog box offers an elabo-
rate set of options for converting AutoCAD files.
 
In the Adobe PDF Settings for Autodesk AutoCAD documents dialog box, you find a 
Configuration Preferences button. Click the button and the Adobe PDFMaker dialog box 
opens where you can choose folders for AutoCAD resource directories. Choosing folders 
containing resource information instructs Acrobat to search the selected folders for 
embedding data when files are converted to PDF.

215
Converting Files to PDF

n BMP/JPEG/PCX/PNG/PICT (Macintosh only)/TIFF. These file formats all use identical 
settings. Whereas many other file formats use the Acrobat Distiller application in the 
background and have Adobe PDF Settings applied during file conversion, these image file 
formats don’t use Distiller and no Adobe PDF Settings are applied during file conversion. 
Different conversion settings can be applied from the same options lists to each of the file 
types individually. Therefore, a BMP file, for example, can be converted with one level of 
image compression and a TIFF file can be converted with another level of compression.
 
All of these file formats are image formats and the types of settings you apply to them 
relate to image options, such as file compression and color management. The same set 
of options available from pull-down menus exists for all the different color modes listed 
in the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box shown in Figure 7.12.
 FIGURE 7.12
Adobe PDF Settings for image files are available for file compression and color management.
NOTE
NOTE
Inasmuch as the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box appears the same for all image 
formats, some options may be grayed out depending on the type of file to be con-
verted. For example, TIFF images can have compression applied during PDF conversion, whereas 
JPEG images cannot. Therefore, the compression options for JPEG images are grayed out.
 
The top of the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box offers you options for file compression for 
monochrome (black-and-white line art), grayscale, and color images. The compression 
options you can select for each of these color modes include the following:
n CCITT G4. CCITT Group 4 compression is available only for monochrome images. 
This compression scheme, similar to the compression used by fax machines, works 
best for black-and-white images and results in smaller file sizes without data loss.

216
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
n JPEG (Quality: Low/Medium/High/Maximum). For grayscale and color images you 
can select from several compression options to specify the acceptable amount of data 
loss. Medium is sufficient for almost any kind of desktop printing and low-end out-
put. High and Maximum are more suited for high-end printing and digital prepress. 
Use JPEG for files that need to be exchanged with users of Acrobat versions below 6.0.
n JBIG2000 (Quality: Minimum/Low/Medium/High/Maximum). JBIG2000 is a newer 
compression scheme that offers much better compression and image quality than JPEG. 
For the amount of compression to be applied, select from the Quality settings for 
Minimum, Low, Medium, High, and Maximum. High and Maximum settings result in 
very little data loss that can be visibly seen in printed documents and high magnification 
levels onscreen. Medium is sufficient for any kind of desktop printing, and the mini-
mum and low compression levels are more suited to screen displays. Use JBIG2000 
compression when exchanging files with users of Acrobat 6.0 and later.
n JPEG2000 (Quality: Lossless). JBIG2000 lossless offers the most compression with-
out data loss for grayscale and color images.
n ZIP. ZIP compression is a lossless compression scheme. It works best where you have 
large areas of a common color — for example, a background with one color and a few 
foreground images with different colors.
 
The lower section of the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box handles Color Management. You 
have choices for applying settings to the three common color modes: RGB, CMYK, and 
Grayscale. The Other option at the bottom of the dialog box handles special color consid-
erations such as spot colors you might find in duotones, tritones, and quadtones.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on color management and understanding different color 
modes, see Chapter 31.
 
The color management policies you can apply to each color mode are identical and they 
all include options from one of three choices:
n Preserve embedded profiles. If you work with images that have been assigned a color 
profile, choosing this option preserves the profile embedded in the document. 
Theoretically, no color changes occur when porting the files across platforms and 
devices.
n Off. If a color profile is embedded in an image, the profile is discarded.
n Ask when opening. If you select this option, Acrobat prompts you in a dialog box 
to use the embedded profile or discard it. You can make individual selections as you 
open files.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more detail on color management and working with color profiles, see 
Chapter 31.
n Microsoft Office/PostScript/EPS. The Microsoft Office and PostScript/EPS options 
include choices for Adobe PDF Settings and Adobe PDF Security. In addition, you have 
options for enabling accessibility, adding bookmarks from style sheets, converting an 
Excel workbook, and similar settings unique to each Microsoft program. With Microsoft

Specific uses for enabling accessibility and adding bookmarks and links to PDFs 
from Microsoft Office applications a re covered in Chapter 8 and Chapter 25.
After making choices for the options you want to use for file conversions, click the OK button in 
the Preferences dialog box. All the settings are set as new defaults until you change them. These 
settings are applied to documents you import from a file, from multiple files, and when you use 
the Open command in Acrobat.
Converting multiple files to PDF
The menu command you had available in Acrobat 7 for converting multiple files to PDF was 
Create PDF ➪ From Multiple Files. This command disappeared from the Create PDF task button in 
Acrobat 8, and a new task button (Combine Files) was added in Acrobat 8 that has been rebranded 
as Combine in Acrobat 9. You can still use the Create task button in Acrobat 9 and choose Merge 
Files into a single PDF or use the Combine task button and choose the same menu command.
 
 In Acrobat 9 you can convert multiple files to PDF or combine multiple PDF documents 
 together in either a PDF file or a PDF Portfolio. Acrobat 8 supported PDF Packages that are 
gone in Acrobat 9 in favor of the new PDF Portfolios feature. Because there are so many options 
available when working with the Combine task button and menu commands, I added a chapter 
to cover all you need to know about working with both Combine and PDF Portfolios.

Converting Clipboard images
Suppose you have a map contained as part of a layout and you want to clip out the map and send 
it off to a friend for directions to an event, or perhaps you want to take a screenshot of an FTP client 
application to show log-on instructions, or maybe you want to clarify the use of a dialog box in 
Acrobat or another application. All of these examples and many more are excellent candidates for 
screen captures.
To capture a screenshot of the entire monitor screen in Windows, press the Shift+PrtScrn (Print 
Screen) or PrtSc keys. The keystrokes copy the current view of your monitor to the Clipboard. You 
can launch Acrobat or maximize it and select From Clipboard from the Create task button pull-
down menu. The Clipboard data opens as a PDF document in the Acrobat Document pane. If you 
have a menu or dialog box open, the screen capture includes the foreground items in the capture 
like the screenshots shown throughout this book. Screens captured on Windows through these 
methods create 96-ppi (pixels per inch) images; captures on the Mac are 72 ppi.
If you want to capture a dialog box without the background on Windows, use Alt+PrtScrn (or 
PrtSc). The dialog box screenshots in this book were all taken by using these key modifiers.
NOTE
NOTE
Copying a screenshot to the Clipboard works with any program or at the operating 
system level when capturing desktop or folder views, accessories, or virtually any 
view you see on your computer monitor. Once data are on the Clipboard, you can open Acrobat 
and convert the Clipboard data to a PDF document.
Converting Clipboard images (Macintosh)
Converting Clipboard data on the Macintosh is handled exactly the same as when converting 
Clipboard data on Windows. However, if you want to first take a screenshot on the Mac, you use 
Acrobat instead of keystrokes.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
On the Mac version of Acrobat you have additional commands for capturing screen-
shots. These commands are not necessary on Windows where your keyboard can 
easily capture screenshots; but on the Mac, no keystrokes exist for capturing a screen and saving 
the captured data to the Clipboard. All Mac keystrokes used for capturing screenshots record 
the data in a file saved to the Desktop as a .png file.
To capture a screen to the Clipboard, select File ➪ Create PDF ➪ and choose one of the three screen 
capture items you see listed in the menu as shown in Figure 7.14:
n From Screen Capture. Selecting this option is the same as using Ô+Shift+3. The entire 
monitor window is captured and converted to PDF.
n From Window Capture. Using this option is like pressing Ô+Shift+4 and then pressing 
the Spacebar. A camera icon appears as the cursor. Move the icon on top of a window 
and click to capture just that window.
n From Selection Capture. Using this option is like pressing Ô+Shift+4, but without fol-
lowing with pressing the Spacebar. A crosshair appears as a new cursor. Click and drag 
the area to capture and release the mouse button. The selected area is converted to PDF.

Taking snapshots
In the Select & Zoom toolbar, select the Snapshot tool and click on a PDF page. The entire page is 
copied to the Clipboard. You can then create a PDF file From Clipboard Image as described in the 
previous section. The page you create, however, is a raster image when you convert it to PDF. You 
lose all text attributes when copying a page in this manner. A better solution for converting an 
entire page is to use the Extract Pages command.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on extracting pages, see Chapter 16.
 
 The advantage of using the Snapshot tool is when taking a snapshot of a partial page in 
 Acrobat. You can select the Snapshot tool and drag a marquee in an area you want to copy. 
When you release the mouse button, the selected area is copied to the Clipboard. Choose PDF 
from Clipboard from the Create task button to convert the selection to PDF. Again, you lose all 
type attributes, but you can use this method if retaining text is not an issue or if you want to crop 
an image. Using the Crop tool doesn’t reduce the page size or file size of a PDF document. Using 
the Snapshot tool results in smaller file sizes when copying smaller sections of a PDF page.
Snapshots cannot be taken in password-protected files. If a file is encrypted, you need to eliminate 
the file encryption before using the Snapshot tool.

You use the Create PDF from Web Page menu command to convert Web pages to PDF. You can also 
use Create PDF task button and choose PDF From Web Page to convert Web pages hosted on Web 
sites or HTML files stored locally on your computer or networked servers.
Web Capture provides a complex set of preferences and tools with different options for convert-
ing Web pages, a Web site, Web links, HTML form fields, animations, or multiple sites to PDF. A 
captured Web site converts HTML, text files, and images to PDF, and each Web page is appended 
to the converted document. Conversion to PDF from Web sites can provide many opportunities 
for archiving information, analyzing data, creating search indexes, and many more uses where 
information needs to reside locally on computers.
Web pages containing animation such as Flash animation can be converted to PDF in Acrobat 6 
and later. When animated pages are captured, the animation effects are viewed in the PDF file in 
any Acrobat viewer.

Understanding Web site structure
To understand how to capture a Web site and convert the documents to PDF, you need a funda-
mental understanding of a Web page and the structure of a site. A Web page is a file created with 
the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). There is nothing specific to the length of a Web page. A 
page may be a screen the size of 640 × 480 pixels or a length equivalent to several hundred letter-
sized pages. Size, in terms of linear length, is usually determined by the page content and amount 
of space needed to display the page. PDF files, on the other hand, have fixed lengths up to 200 × 
200 inches. You can determine the fixed size of the PDF page prior to converting the Web site from 
HTML to PDF. After the PDF page size is determined, any Web pages captured adhere to the fixed 
size. If a Web page is larger than the established PDF page, the overflow automatically creates 
additional PDF pages. Hence, a single converted Web page may result in several PDF pages.

Web site design typically follows a hierarchical order. The home page rests at the topmost level 
where direct links from this page occupy a second level. Subsequently, links from the second level 
refer to pages at a third level and so on.
When pages are captured with Acrobat, the user can specify the number of levels to convert. Be 
forewarned, however, that even two levels of a Web site can occupy many Web pages. The number 
of pages and the speed of your Internet connection determine the amount of time needed to cap-
ture a site.
Understanding captured pages structure
One or more levels can be captured from a Web site. You decide the number of levels to convert in 
the Create PDF from Web Page dialog box. PDF pages are converted and placed in a new PDF file 
or appended to an existing PDF file. One nice feature with Create PDF from Web Page is that it can 
seek out and append only new pages that have not yet been downloaded.
After pages are converted to PDF they can be viewed in Acrobat. Any URL links on the converted 
Web page are preserved in the resultant PDF and can be used to append files to the PDF or open 
the link destinations in your Web browser. The file types that can be converted to PDF include the 
following:
n Adobe PDF format. Although not converted to PDF because they already appear in the 
format, PDF pages can be downloaded with Create PDF from Web Page.
NOTE
NOTE
XML forms created in Adobe LiveCycle Designer are not converted (nor do they 
appear in the Acrobat Document pane) when using the Create ➪ PDF From Web 
Page command. Designer forms are added to blank pages converted to PDF as file attachments.
n FDF. Form Data Format files can be captured and converted to PDF. An FDF file might 
be form data exported from a PDF form.
n GIF Image Format (Graphics Interchange Format). GIF images, as well as the last 
image in an animated GIF, can be captured when you convert a Web site to PDF. GIFs, 
like JPEGs within the HTML file, can also appear on separate PDF pages.
n HTML documents. HTML files can be converted to PDF. The hypertext links from the 
original HTML file are active in the PDF document as long as the destination documents 
and URLs have also been converted.
n JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) image format. Images used in the HTML 
documents are also captured and converted to PDF. JPEGs may be part of the converted 
HTML page. When captured, they can be part of a captured HTML page and can also 
appear individually on PDF pages.
n Multimedia Content. Multimedia content including Flash animation can be embedded 
in Web pages converted to PDF.
n Plain text. Any text-only documents contained on a Web site, such as an ASCII text docu-
ment, can be converted to PDF. When capturing text-only files, you have the opportunity 
to control many text attributes and page formats.

222
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
n PNG image format. Portable Network Graphics (PNG) contained in Web pages can be 
converted to PDF just like GIF and JPEG images.
n XDP. Forms created with Adobe LiveCycle Designer can be saved in XDP (XML Data 
Package) that can be understood by an XFA plug-in.
n XFDF. XML-based FDF files typically exported from PDF forms can be converted to PDF.
n Image maps. Image maps created in HTML are converted to PDF. The links associated 
with the map are active in the PDF as long as the link destinations are also converted.
n Password-secure areas. A password-secure area of a Web site can also be converted to 
PDF. In order to access a secure site, however, you need the password(s).
Accepted file types and links
If a Web page link to another Web page or URL exists, it is preserved in the converted PDF docu-
ment. Links to pages, sites, and various actions work similarly to the way they do directly on the 
Web site. However, if a PDF document contains a link to another PDF document, the converted 
file doesn’t preserve the link. When the site is converted, the captured pages reside in a single PDF 
document. In order to maintain PDF links that open other PDF documents, the destination docu-
ments need to be captured as individual pages or extracted and saved from the converted pages.
Links to other levels are also inactive if they have not been converted during the capture. You can 
append individual linked pages to the converted PDF document by clicking Web links. Selections 
for converting individual links can be made available in a dialog box that opens after clicking a 
Web link. You can then append one or more links to the converted document. You can find the 
specifics on how to accomplish this task in “Appending pages” a little later in this chapter.
For executed animation, such as an animation from a GIF file or other programming application, 
the download contains only the last image in the sequence. A mouseover effect that changes an 
image is preserved in the converted PDF document as long as you download both the original image 
and the image associated with the mouseover. Additionally, you can capture sounds contained in 
documents.
You can also convert form fields to PDF, and field types such as radio buttons, check boxes, list 
boxes, and combo boxes often convert with the data intact. You might want to convert a form that 
has a list of countries and use the form field in your own PDF forms. The Acrobat implementation 
of JavaScript varies considerably from JavaScript written for Web pages, and therefore many 
JavaScripts do not work in converted Web pages.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on form field types, see Chapters 33 and 34.
For Web pages that contain non-English characters, you need to have the appropriate resources 
loaded in order to download and convert the files. Japanese characters, for example, require instal-
lation of the Far East language files and additional system files. Using non-English characters requires 
you to make additional settings choices for Language Scripts. The options are available in the HTML 
Conversion Settings dialog box in the Fonts and Encoding tab. For making adjustments in the 
HTML Conversion Settings dialog box, see the section “Conversion Settings” later in this chapter.

Bookmarks in converted pages
After you convert a Web site to PDF, you can edit the document in Acrobat as you would any other 
PDF. Links to pages become editable links — that is, you can modify their properties. When a site 
has been converted to PDF, all the PDF pages contain bookmarks linked to the respective pages, as 
shown in Figure 7.15. The first bookmark is a regular (unstructured) bookmark that contains the 
domain name from which the site was captured. All bookmarks appearing below the server name 
are structured bookmarks linked to the converted pages. With the exception of specific Web appli-
cations, you can edit these bookmarks like any other bookmarks created in Acrobat. Additionally, 
you can use structured bookmarks for page editing by moving and deleting the bookmarks and 
associated pages.

Capturing Web pages
To begin capturing Web pages, choose File ➪ Create PDF ➪ From Web Page. The Create PDF from 
Web Page dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7.16.
NOTE
NOTE
Acrobat 9 doesn’t have a Convert Web Page tool as was found in earlier versions 
of Acrobat. You can use the Fiule menu or click the Create task button and choose 
PDF from Web Page or choose Advanced ➪ Web Capture ➪ Create PDF From/Append Web Page.
 FIGURE 7.16
When you select the From Web Page command, the Create PDF from Web Page dialog box opens.
In the Create PDF from Web Page dialog box, various settings determine many different attributes 
for how a Web page is converted to PDF and how it appears in the Acrobat Document pane. The 
first level of controls is handled in the Create PDF from Web Page dialog box. Additional buttons 
in this dialog box open other dialog boxes where you apply many more settings. If this is your first 
attempt at capturing a Web page, open the Create PDF from Web Page dialog box. Type a URL in 
the URL text box.
The default view shows you an abbreviated list of options as shown in the top of Figure 7.16. Click 
the Capture Multiple Levels button in the dialog box to expand the options as shown at the bottom 
of Figure 7.16. When the options are expanded, you can enter the number of levels in the Get only 
text box. Type 1 for the levels and click the Create button.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Be certain the Levels text box is set to 1 on your first attempt. Entering any other 
value may keep you waiting for some time depending on how many pages down-
load from additional levels.

Depending on the site, the number of different links from the site to other URLs, and the structure 
of the HTML pages, you often need to wade through the maze of dialog boxes that control settings 
for the PDF conversion from the HTML files. You don’t need to memorize all of these settings; just 
use the following section as a reference when you capture Web pages.
Adjusting settings in the Create PDF from Web Page dialog box
The controls available to you in the Create PDF from Web Page dialog box begin with the URL you 
type in the URL text box. This URL determines the site where the pages, which are converted, are 
hosted. After you enter the URL, the remaining selections you need to set include:
n Get only x levels. First, you need to click the Capture Multiple Pages button to expand 
the dialog box as shown in Figure 7.16. Appended pages can contain more than one 
level. The URL link may go to another site hosted on another server or stay on the same 
server. Select the levels to be downloaded by clicking the up or down arrows or entering 
a numeric value in the Get only text box.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
A Web site can have two levels of extraordinary size. If the Home page is on the first 
level and many links are contained on the Home page, all the associated links are at 
the second level. If you’re downloading with a slow connection, the time needed to capture the 
site can be quite long.
n Get Entire Site. When you select this radio button, all levels on the Web site are 
downloaded.
n Stay on same path. When this option is enabled, all documents are confined to the 
directory path under the selected URL.
n Stay on same serve. Links made to other servers are not downloaded when this option is 
enabled.
n Create. When you’re ready to convert Web pages from the site identified in the URL field 
box, click the Create button.
n Browse. Selecting this button enables you to capture a Web site residing on your com-
puter or network server. Click Browse to open a navigation dialog box where you can 
find the directory where HTML pages are stored and capture the pages.
n Settings. Click this button to make choices for the conversion options. See “Conversion 
settings” later in this chapter.
TIP
TIP
An alternative to using the Create from Web Page dialog box for a single Web page 
stored locally on your computer is to use drag and drop. Select the HTML document 
to convert to PDF and drag it to the top of the Acrobat window or program icon. If you have mul-
tiple HTML files to convert, you can also use the Create From Multiple Files menu command.
Although it may not be entirely practical, Web designers who are more comfortable with WYSIWYG 
(What You See Is What You Get) HTML editors than layout applications may find that creating 
layout assemblies in their favorite editor is beneficial. You can’t get control over image sampling,

but you can achieve a layout for screen display. Create the layout in a program such as Adobe 
Dreamweaver. When you’re finished with the pages, launch Acrobat and select Create task button 
> PDF from Web Page. Click the Browse button in the Create PDF from Web Page dialog box and 
navigate to your HTML files. Click the Create button to convert your pages to PDF. You can send 
these pages as an email attachment to a colleague or print them to your desktop printer. One 
advantage for using this method is your client or co-worker can add comments with the Comment 
& Markup tools to mark corrections and/or revisions when reviewing Web page designs.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Even though you may browse to a folder on your hard drive and convert a local Web 
site to PDF, any external links launch your Internet connection and capture pages 
on another site. If you want only local pages converted, be certain to click the Stay on same 
server button in the Create PDF from Web Page dialog box.

You can create Web pages from tools installed by Acrobat in Microsoft Internet 
Explorer in Windows only. For information related to converting Web pages to 
PDF from within Microsoft Internet Explorer, see Chapter 27. For more information on using 
Comment & Markup tools, see Chapter 20.
Conversion settings
Clicking the Settings button in the Create PDF from Web Page dialog box opens the Web Page 
Conversion Settings dialog box, which has two tabs on which you supply file conversion attributes 
and page layout settings. The General tab deals with the file attribute settings, as shown in Figure 7.17.
 FIGURE 7.17
The Web Page Conversion Settings dialog box offers controls for file types and how they will be converted 
to PDF.

Acrobat 9 limits your choices for file type conversion to HTML and plain Text. Earlier versions of 
Acrobat offered separate options for converting various image formats. Choose from the File Type 
menu either HTML or Text, and settings adjustments for these file types are further selected from 
another dialog box that opens when you click the Settings button.
At the bottom of the dialog box are three PDF Settings check boxes:
n Create bookmarks. When you enable this option, pages converted to PDF have struc-
tured bookmarks created for each page captured. The page’s title is used as the bookmark 
name. If the page has no title, Acrobat supplies the URL as the bookmark name.
n Place headers & footers on new page. A header and footer are placed on all converted 
pages if this option is enabled. A header in the HTML file consists of the page title appear-
ing with the <HEAD> tag. The footer retrieves the page’s URL, the page name, and a date 
stamp for the date and time the page was downloaded.
n Create PDF tags. The structure of the converted PDF matches that of the original HTML 
file. Items such as list elements, table cells, and similar HTML tags are preserved. The 
PDF document contains structured bookmarks for each of the structured items. A tagged 
bookmark then links to a table, list, or other HTML element.
When you select HTML in the File Type menu and click the Settings button, a dialog box opens 
for HTML Conversion Settings, as shown in Figure 7.18.
 FIGURE 7.18
When you select HTML in the File Description list and click the Settings button, the HTML Conversion 
Settings dialog box opens.

The two tabs in the HTML Conversion Settings dialog box are the General tab and the Fonts and 
Encoding tab. The first group of settings handles the general attributes assigned to the page layout:
n Input Encoding. Sets the Web page text encoding for body text, heads, and preformatted 
text. The default is consistent with the language you install. Other supported languages 
include Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Unicode characters.
n Language Specific Font Settings. The items appearing under the Language Specific Font 
Settings section contain choices for font attributes and language choices. Choose from the 
menu options to select the Language, Body Text, and Base Font Size.
n Default Colors. Use this option to assign new default colors for Text, Background color, 
Links, and Alt Text. You can choose a color from a set of preset colors, or choose the 
option for custom colors, from a palette that opens after you click the swatch.
n Force These Settings for All Pages. HTML pages may or may not have assigned color 
values. When no color is assigned for one of these items, this setting defines the unassigned 
elements with the colors set in the Default Colors section. If this check box is enabled, all 
colors, including HTML-assigned colors, are changed to the Default Colors.
n Multimedia. Enables you to set options for handling multimedia clips. From the pull-down 
menu, you can choose from three options:
n Disable multimedia capture. Movie and sound clips are ignored. Only the Web 
pages are converted to PDF and no links to the media are included in the capture.
n Embed multimedia content when possible. Acrobat viewers 6 and above enable you 
to embed multimedia clips in the PDF document. Selecting this option captures the 
Web page and embeds any multimedia files that meet the compatibility requirements 
of Acrobat. Be aware that embedded multimedia files are available only to Acrobat 
viewers 6.0 or later.
n Reference multimedia content by URL. The captured Web page contains a link to 
the URL where the multimedia files are hosted.

For more about the new features for handling multimedia in PDF documents, see 
Chapter 23.
n Retain page background. These include settings for the background colors used on the 
Web page, tiled image backgrounds, and table cells. When these check boxes are enabled, 
the original design is preserved in the PDF document.
TIP
TIP
If you find table cells, background colors, and tiled background images distracting 
when you’re reading Web pages either in a browser or converted to PDF, disable 
the Background Options check boxes before converting to PDF. The original design is changed, 
but the files are easily legible for both screen reading and when printed.
n Convert Images. If checked, graphics are converted. If unchecked, the graphics are not 
converted.

TIP
TIP
To produce faster downloads, disable the Convert Images check box. The number 
of pages to be converted is significantly reduced, thereby reducing the amount of 
time to capture a Web site.
n Underline Links. Displays the text used in an <A HREF...> tag with an underline. 
This option can be helpful if the text for a link is not a different color than the body copy.
After making choices in the HTML Conversion Settings dialog box, click OK and you return to the 
Web page Conversions dialog box shown earlier in Figure 7.17. Choose Text from the File Type 
menu and click the Settings button to open options for handling text conversions as shown in 
Figure 7.19.
 FIGURE 7.19
Choose Text from the File Type menu and click Settings to open the Text Conversion Settings dialog box.
Options for text conversions include many similar choices you have for HTML conversions with 
regard to Input Encoding, Language Specific Font Settings, and font color choices. One additional 
option appears for Wrap Lines at Margin that controls word wrap in unformatted text.
Page Layout conversion settings
All the settings discussed on the previous few pages were related to the General tab. In the Web 
Page Conversion Settings dialog box, another option is available. Page layout offers you options for 
describing the physical size and orientation of converted pages. Click the Page Layout tab and the 
Web Page Conversion Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7.20.

230
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
 FIGURE 7.20
The Page Layout options are available from the Web Page Conversion Settings dialog box when you 
select the Page Layout tab.
Page layout attributes enable you to force long HTML pages into more standard page sizes for view-
ing or printing. If an HTML page spans several letter-sized pages, you can determine where the page 
breaks occur and the orientation of the converted pages. Many options are available in the Page Layout 
tab of the Web Page Conversion Settings dialog box:
n Page Size. This pull-down menu provides a variety of default page sizes. Acrobat supports 
page sizes from 1-inch square to 200-inches square. You can supply any value between 
the minimum and maximum page sizes in the Width and Height field boxes below the 
pull-down menu to override the fixed sizes available from the pull-down menu. To make 
changes in the field boxes, edit the text, click the up and down arrows in the dialog box, 
or click in a field box and press the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard. Press 
Tab and Shift+Tab to toggle between the field boxes.
n Margins. In the four Margins field boxes, you can set the amount of space on all four sides 
of the PDF page before any data appear. You make the changes for the margin sizes via the 
same methods described in the preceding bullet.

231
Converting Files to PDF

n Orientation. You choose portrait or landscape orientation from the radio button options. 
If a site’s Web pages all conform to screen sizes such as 640 × 480, you might want to 
change the orientation to landscape.
n Scale Wide Contents to fit page. Once again, because HTML documents don’t follow 
standard page sizes, images and text can be easily clipped when these documents are 
converted to a standard size. When this option is enabled, the page contents are reduced 
in size to fit within the page margins.
n Switch to landscape if scaled smaller than. The percentage value is user definable. When 
the page contents appear on a portrait page within the limit specified in the field box, the 
PDF document is automatically converted to a landscape orientation. The default is 70 
percent. If the default value is used, any vertical page scaled lower than 70 percent is 
auto-switched to landscape as long as the orientation is selected for Portrait.
PDF WORKFLOW
PDF WORKFLOW If your workflow is dependent on capturing Web pages routinely, then you’ll want 
to use the same conversion settings for all your Web captures. Educational facilities, 
government agencies, research institutes, and large corporate offices may have frequent needs 
for archiving research information found on the Web.
Unfortunately, Acrobat makes no provision for saving and loading Web Capture settings estab-
lished in the dialog boxes discussed in the preceding pages. To develop a workflow suited to 
organizations or workgroups, your alternative may be setting up a single computer dedicated to 
the task of capturing data from the Web. The computer needs to be licensed for Acrobat, but 
using a single computer ensures all Web captures are performed with the same conversion set-
tings. Users with any Acrobat viewer can retrieve the PDF files that are captured across a network 
or intranet.
Determining download status
After you choose all settings and options in all the dialog boxes pertaining to converting Web sites 
to PDF, you can revisit the Create PDF from Web Page command from any one of the three meth-
ods discussed earlier. As pages are downloaded and converted to PDF, the Download Status dialog 
box opens displaying, appropriately, the download status. After the first page downloads, this dia-
log box, shown in Figure 7.21, moves to the background behind the converted Web pages.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Web Capture places the converted PDF in memory and uses your hard drive space 
as an extension of RAM. The PDF is not saved to disk until you perform a Save or 
Save As operation. If your computer crashes or you quit without saving, the file is lost and you’ll 
need to capture the site again.
The dialog box actually remains open, but hides behind the PDF pages being converted as the 
download continues. If you want to bring the Download Status dialog box to the foreground, 
choose Advanced ➪ Web Capture ➪ Bring Status Dialogs to Foreground. The dialog box opens in 
the foreground while Acrobat continues to convert pages.

The Download Status dialog box appears momentarily and then disappears as Acrobat continues to down-
load pages and convert them to PDF.
Appending pages
When a PDF file is open in the Document pane, you can append pages from URL links by choosing 
Advanced ➪ Web Capture and then selecting the appropriate choice from the submenu commands. 
The submenu options from the Advanced ➪ Web Capture menu shown in Figure 7.22 relate to Web 
Capture features.
 FIGURE 7.22
When you choose Advanced ➪ Web Capture, the submenu displays options for treatment of Web captures.

To append pages to the open PDF, make choices from the following selections in the Web Capture 
submenu:
n Create PDF From/Append Web Page. Selecting this option opens the Add to PDF from 
Web Page dialog box where you make attribute choices. The dialog box offers the same 
choices as originally displayed in the Create PDF from Web Page dialog box. When 
appending pages, you can change the attribute choices for all conversion options such 
as the URL, number of levels to be downloaded, and so on.
n Append All Links on Page. When you select this submenu option, no dialog box opens 
before the download commences. All Web links to other HTML pages are converted and 
appended to the PDF. Conversion settings are used from the last choices you made in the 
Create PDF from Web Page dialog box. If you need to change the conversion settings for 
links to other pages, you can use the View Web Links dialog box.
n View Web Links. The Select Page Links to Download dialog box opens when you select 
this menu command. This dialog box lists all Web links according to URL.
 
The list contains an icon displayed at the far left of the URL list informing you that a link 
to the URL exists. You can select each of the items in the list. After you select a link, the 
Properties button on the right side of the dialog box becomes active. Click the Properties 
button and another dialog box opens. You’ll notice in the next dialog box the options for 
conversion settings appear within three tabs. These options are the same as those you use 
with the Create PDF From Web Page command.
n Page Info. This option opens a dialog box displaying information about the current page 
viewed in the PDF file. As you scroll through pages, the page info changes according to 
the page viewed. The information supplied in the dialog box includes the original URL, 
title of the page, creation date, a description of the content, and the preferred zoom level 
for viewing.
n Open Page in Web Browser. Choose this option to open the linked page in your default 
Web browser. With new features in Acrobat 9 and Microsoft Internet Explorer you can 
capture a portion of a Web page if you only want partial data on the page converted to PDF.
CROSS-REF

For more information on using the PDFMaker with Microsoft Internet Explorer, see 
Chapter 27.
n Bring Status Dialogs to Foreground. When capturing pages you may see the Download 
Status dialog box disappear behind the captured Web pages. While a capture is in progress, 
choose this menu command to bring the Download Status dialog box forward.
TIP
TIP
You can also append Web pages by Control/Option+clicking a link on the PDF page. 
If the link destination is not contained in the PDF, the URL is contacted and the 
page is appended to the PDF. When you position the cursor over a link, the cursor displays a 
hand icon and index finger pointing upward. If a link has not yet been converted, the icon dis-
plays a W character inside the hand and a tooltip shows the URL where you can find the link. If 
the link has been converted to PDF, no plus (+) symbol and no URL are shown. If you want to 
open a link in your Web browser, click the link.

Locating Web addresses
Acrobat 7 through 9 are intelligent viewers when it comes to detecting URLs in text on PDF pages. 
You don’t need a link or button to click URL text and launch your default Web browser. Acrobat 7 
through 9 do that automatically for you.
In order for Acrobat viewers to recognize URLs in text, you need to be certain a Preference option 
is enabled in the General Preferences. Open the Preferences dialog box (Control/Ô+K) and click 
General in the left pane. Check Create links from URLs in the right pane as shown in Figure 7.23.
 FIGURE 7.23
Open Preferences and check Create links from URLs from General.
If you prepare PDF files for users of earlier versions of Acrobat viewers, then you need to create links 
to URLs in text if you want users to click text to launch a Web page. You can easily create links from 
URLs in text using a simple menu command. But don’t do this if you know your entire audience 
uses a 7.0 viewer or above. The more links or buttons you add to a PDF, the larger your file size 
will be.
The text must have a URL listing beginning with http://, https:, or www. In addition any email 
address such as designer@company.com will be recognized as a mailto: link that will open your 
default mail client. After the Web links are converted, you can also click the link and append pages 
by using Web Capture. PDF authors may also create Web links for end users when distributing 
files to others.
To create Web links on pages containing URLs, choose Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Create 
Links from URLs. A dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 7.24.
In the Create Web Links dialog box, you specify page ranges for where Acrobat should create the 
links. Acrobat performs this task quickly and creates all links where the proper syntax has been 
used to describe the URL. If you want to delete links from a PDF document, open the Remove 
Web Links dialog box by choosing Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Remove All Links. The 
Remove Web Links dialog box opens and you can supply page ranges for eliminating Web links.

Converting Flash Files to PDF
It’s been a few years since Adobe’s acquisition of Macromedia. The engineers have been hard at 
work trying to integrate the Adobe programs with the newly acquired Macromedia programs. With 
the introduction of Acrobat 9, we begin to see the fruits of Adobe’s labor — particularly with the 
integration of Adobe Flash and PDF.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
 
Acrobat 9 has been introduced with a host of new features supporting 
 
 Adobe Flash. In regard to converting file formats, you can convert Flash FLV 
and SWF files by using the Create > PDF from File command. In Addition, you’ll find the new 
Flash tool in the new Multimedia toolbar for inserting Flash files into PDF. 
In Chapter 23 I talk about importing Flash video in PDF files and cover all the options choices you 
have when adding Flash files to PDF documents. For now, just know that you can convert a Flash 
FLV or SWF file to a PDF document by clicking the Create task button and choosing PDF from 
File. In the Open dialog box, select the file you want to convert and click Open. The Insert Flash 
dialog box opens as shown in Figure 7.25.
The Insert Flash dialog box provides many options choices for playing a Flash video, video frame 
appearance settings, launch attributes, and display quality. The initial pane in the Insert Flash dia-

Creating PDFs from Templates
One thing I’ve wanted for a long time as a feature in Acrobat has been the ability to create a PDF 
document from a template. Many different authoring applications support creating new files from 
templates, but not Acrobat — at least not the way I want to create a new PDF. You might want to 
reuse a purchase order form, an invoice form, a vacation leave slip, or some other such document 
you work with on an ongoing basis.
The nice thing about using templates is that they prevent you from inadvertently overwriting the 
original. Every time you open a template it’s a fresh original; and when you click the Save tool, 
you’re prompted to type a new name. This feature, as well as having your templates always stored 
in the same location, helps save time and aggravation.
Why hasn’t Adobe added a command like Create PDF ➪ From Template? The primary reason is 
that not enough users have asked for this feature. I’ve asked Adobe for it for several years, but as 
a user of one, you can see how excited Adobe is to devote some engineering hours to the task.
But I’ll bet many others have wanted such a feature in Acrobat, so I’m going to walk you through 
some steps so that you can actually create a workflow to create PDFs from template files. It might 
appear a little convoluted at first, but if you’re like me, in the end it will save time over the hours 
you spend searching folders for files. The Adobe engineers didn’t design this method to be used 
this way, but Acrobat is flexible enough that you can add some of your own personality in your 
workflow. If creating PDFs from templates is of interest to you, look over the following steps.
STEPS: Creating PDFs from templates
 
1. Create a PDF document for use as a template. You can use any kind of PDF document 
you like. In my example I use a form created in Adobe Designer.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on creating forms in Adobe Designer, see Chapter 35.
 
2. Add a document title. If using an Acrobat PDF form, open the Document Properties 
(Ctrl/Ô+D) and click Description. If using a LiveCycle Designer form, you can’t edit the 
Document title. Skip this step when using Designer forms. In the Title field, type a 
descriptive title name to help identify your template.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on working with document properties and adding document 
titles, see Chapter 6.
 
3. Save the PDF. Select File ➪ Save As and save the file to a location where you can find it 
easily — such as the Desktop. For the filename, use any name that easily describes the 
document. In my example I used tedsInvoice.pdf for the file name. Quit Acrobat.
 
4. Copy the document to a templates folder. On Windows, open the DocTemplates 
folder. The path is C:/Program Files/Adobe/Acrobat 9.0/Acrobat/
DocTemplates/[language]ENU. Copy your template to the [language]ENU folder.

238
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
 
 On the Macintosh open the Macintosh/Applications/Adobe Acrobat 9.0 
Pro folder. Click the Adobe Acrobat Pro program icon once to select it. Open a context 
menu on the program icon (Ctrl+click) and select Show Package Contents. The folder 
that opens has two subfolders. Double-click the Contents folder to open it. Find the 
Resources folder and open it. Locate the en.lproj folder and open it. Inside this folder you 
find the DocTemplates folder. Open that folder and copy your template to this folder.
 
5. Store the backup copy. Copy your original file to a folder on your hard drive where 
you can easily return to it. If you upgrade your version of Acrobat, you can lose your 
DocTemplates folder. Try to keep some backup files in a folder location you can easily 
return to when upgrading the product.
 
6. Launch Acrobat. When Acrobat opens, click the Secure task button to open the pull-
down menu and select Create Security Envelope, as shown in Figure 7.27. Creating a 
Secure Envelope was not designed for creating PDF files from custom templates, but 
we’re going to fudge things a bit to create a workaround for not having a Create PDF ➪ 
From Template command.
 FIGURE 7.27
Select Secure ➪ Create Security Envelope to access your template.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For securing PDFs with Create Secure Envelope, see Chapter 26.
 
7. Add a file attachment. The Create Security Envelope Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 
7.28. The first pane requires you to add a file attachment. You can’t progress in the wizard 
unless you identify a file to be attached to the envelope. Don’t worry — you delete the file 
attachment later. Click the Add File to Send button and attach any PDF document in the 
Choose files to enclose dialog box.
 
8. Select your new template file. Click Next and the second pane in the wizard opens. 
Here you’ll find a list of default templates listed as template1.pdf, template2.pdf, 
and template3.pdf. Your new template should appear with a name you provided for 
your file name. If you added a document title to your file, the Document Title column 
lists your document title information. In my example, I used a form created in Adobe 
LiveCycle Designer. The Designer document title isn’t reported in this wizard window, as 
you can see in Figure 7.29.

Select your template file.
 
9. Choose the delivery method. Click Next and you arrive at the Delivery Method pane in 
the wizard. Click the first radio button on the right side of the pane for Send the envelope 
later.
 
10. Choose a security policy. Click Next and the Choose a security policy pane opens in the 
wizard. For a custom template used in this example, no security is applied to the docu-
ment. Just click Next and a warning dialog box opens. Click Yes in the warning dialog 
box and you arrive at the final pane in the wizard.

11. Finish the template creation. Click Finish in the last pane and your document opens in 
Acrobat.
 
12. Delete the file attachment. Click the Attachments pane (the paper clip icon) and open a 
context menu on the file attachment listed in the Attachments pane, as shown in Figure 
7.30. Select Delete to delete the attachment. Remember, you had to add a file attachment 
in order to proceed through the wizard window.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on working with file attachments, see Chapter 12.
 FIGURE 7.30
Delete the file attachment and your template is ready for use.
Your template is now ready for use. Make any changes you want on the file. When you click File ➪ 
Save, a Save As dialog box opens prompting you to supply a filename. Your original file remains in 
the DocTemplates folder (until you upgrade Acrobat) and you can’t inadvertently overwrite the file.
At first glance, working through these steps may seem a bit elaborate. However, once you create 
some template files and use them routinely, you can quickly find a template and work with it.

241

Note that you can always store a number of files in the Organizer, but using the Organizer files 
doesn’t give you the same features as using template files where you are prevented from overwriting 
the file. You can also set file properties to Read Only to prevent overwriting, so the Organizer comes 
a little closer to being a good tool for this kind of workflow. However, if you work in an enterprise 
environment where many people use the same templates, copying custom DocTemplates folders to 
all users’ computers is much easier than configuring individual Organizer file links.

Summary
n You can create PDF documents with the Adobe PDF printer. You can use the Adobe PDF 
printer to apply a variety of Adobe PDF Settings to the PDF conversion. Adobe PDF Settings 
are used by Acrobat Distiller and the Adobe PDF Printer.
n You can use Acrobat to convert a variety of different native file formats to PDF using the 
Create PDF From File command. Multiple files can be converted to PDF and concatenated 
into a single document.
n You can use Acrobat to download Web pages and convert them to PDF. Web pages resid-
ing locally on hard drives can be converted to PDF. All Web page conversions preserve 
page and URL links.
n You can convert data copied to the system Clipboard to PDF on both Windows and 
Macintosh. Acrobat 9 provides new commands for Macintosh users to capture screen-
shots and convert to PDF.
n A new feature in Acrobat 9 supports converting Flash video files via the Create 
PDF ➪ From File command.
n Custom templates can be created using the Create Security Envelope features.

T
he last chapter covered PDF file creation from various programs and 
certain file types. Some of the PDF creation options you have from 
within Acrobat are also available directly from the authoring programs. 
Such is the case with the most popular Microsoft applications.
Adobe has devoted much development time to creating tools that easily con-
vert most of the Microsoft applications to PDF along with certain other pro-
grams such as Autodesk AutoCAD discussed in Chapter 7 and Lotus Notes. 
With a one-button click in almost every Microsoft program you can convert 
your documents to PDF.
The common tool used in these programs is Acrobat PDFMaker created by 
Adobe Systems and automatically installed in every program supporting the 
tool when you install Acrobat.
In this chapter you learn how to use the PDFMaker tool in the most popular 
Microsoft programs.
Setting Up the Environment
This chapter is concerned with creating PDFs; therefore, no toolbars need to 
be loaded in the Toolbar Well as far as PDF creation is concerned. Later in 
this chapter, in the section “Working with comments in Microsoft Word” I 
talk about converting Word comments to PDF, but we’ll load the Comment 
& Review tools when we come to that section. For now, don’t be concerned 
about loading any toolbars. You’ll load them when needed in the sections 
ahead.

Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
Using Acrobat with Microsoft Word
Of all the Office applications, Microsoft Word gives you the best support for PDF file creation. 
Microsoft Word is the only word-processing application that provides access to the structural data 
of the document. The structural data of the Word document such as titles, heads, tables, paragraphs, 
figure captions, and so on can be converted to tagged bookmarks. Tagged bookmarks give you 
much more control over the PDF content. You can navigate to the element structures, and move, 
copy, extract, and delete pages through menu commands in the Bookmarks tab.
NOTE
NOTE
Depending on the Acrobat viewer you use, the PDFMaker options are different. In 
Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows only), you have an Embed Video tool. This tool is 
not available in Acrobat Standard and Acrobat Pro.
With Word and all Microsoft Office programs you have several choices for PDF conversion. You 
can use the Create PDF From File command, use the Combine Task or command, drag and drop 
Microsoft Office files on the Acrobat Document pane, print to PostScript and convert the PostScript 
in Acrobat Distiller, and use a tool developed by Adobe called the Acrobat PDFMaker. This tool is 
installed in all Office programs and several other Microsoft programs.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on Create PDF From File, see Chapter 7. For more on using 
Combine Task, see Chapter 12. For more on converting PostScript to PDF, see 
Chapter 10.
Of all the tools available to you, using PDFMaker is your best choice. Why? Because PDFMaker pro-
vides you with more options settings to control the attributes in the converted file. If, for example, 
you want to set up a hierarchy order for bookmarks to appear in the converted PDF, you need to 
use PDFMaker. If you want to convert PowerPoint files with transitions and media effects, you 
need to use PDFMaker. If you want to create layered PDFs from Microsoft Visio, again, you need 
PDFMaker. Other PDF conversion options don’t provide you with support for many of these attributes.
PDFMaker offers several tools to control PDF file creation from within Microsoft Word and all 
other Microsoft programs that use the PDFMaker tools. After you install Acrobat and later open 
Word (or other Office programs), two Acrobat icons appear on the far left side of the toolbar and a 
menu command in MS Office 2003 products and you have a separate tab in the Office 2007 Ribbon.
NOTE
NOTE
You have similar conversion options for using PDFMaker in Microsoft Office 2003 
and Microsoft Office 2007. The user interface is obviously different between the 
 different versions of Microsoft Office. This chapter covers using Office 2007, and all the screen 
shots appearing here were taken using Microsoft’s newest Office release. If you’re an Office 
2003 user, you can find similar conversion settings using the Acrobat menu commands that are 
installed with PDFMaker.
Each of the Office 2007 programs display an Acrobat tab in the Ribbon after you install Acrobat on 
Windows. Click the Acrobat tab and you find several tools, shown in Figure 8.1, used for handling 
Adobe PDF files.

PDFMaker and the Macintosh
P
DFMaker has vanished from the Macintosh in Acrobat 9. Earlier versions of Acrobat included the 
PDFMaker in the MS Office applications, but they weren’t has robust as you had on Windows.
The alternative that consistently produces good PDF documents from MS Office programs is to use 
the File ➪ Print command and print to a PDF document.
In any MS Office program choose File ➪ Print. When the Print dialog box opens, choose Adobe PDF 
9.0 from the printer pull-down menu. Open the PDF menu and choose Save as PDF. The Save dia-
log box opens. Name your file and locate a target folder and click Save.

When you click the Acrobat tab in the Ribbon, you find the following tools.
 Create PDF. Click this button to open the Save Adobe PDF File As dialog box. Name the 
file and click Save to convert the Word document to a PDF.
 Preferences. Formerly called Conversion Settings in earlier versions of MS Office and 
PDFMaker, the Preferences button opens the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box where you 
make choices for conversion options.
 Create and Attach to Email. Clicking this button performs two tasks. The Word docu-
ment is converted to a PDF and the resultant PDF is attached to a new email message in 
your default email client.
 Mail Merge. A mail merge template is merged with a data file and the template and data 
are converted to PDF pages.
 Create and Send For Review. The Word file is converted to a PDF and opens in Acrobat 
with the Send for Shared Review dialog box open and ready for you to make a choice for 
starting a shared review on Acrobat.com or an internal server.

 Acrobat Comments. Click Acrobat Comments and a pull-down menu opens with com-
mands for Importing Comments from Acrobat, Continue Integration Process, Accept All 
Changes in a Document, Delete All Comments in a Document, and Show Instructions — 
a help information dialog box.
 Embed 3D. Click the Embed 3D tool and the Add 3D Data dialog box opens. You can 
choose a 3D file for embedding in the Word document and assign JavaScripts for setting 
different views and rotations.
 Embed Video. Click this button to embed an Adobe Flash animation or multimedia file.
Changing conversion settings (Windows)
PDFMaker uses the PDF Library to convert Office documents to PDF. When you click the Preferences 
button in the Ribbon, the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box opens. In the dialog box, five tabs offer 
attribute choices for how the PDF is ultimately created. The tabs are Settings, Security, Word, 
Bookmarks, and new in Acrobat 9 you find Video as shown in Figure 8. 2.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
Acrobat Distiller is covered in Chapter 10. All subsequent references to Distiller in 
this chapter are explained in more detail in Chapter 10.
Different programs support many different features. For example, Microsoft Visio and Autodesk 
AutoCAD both support layers. Programs such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint do not support lay-
ers. Excel supports workbooks, Word supports style sheets, and PowerPoint supports media and 
transitions. When you open PDFMaker in any program supporting the tool, you’ll find different 
conversion settings options. Be aware that the dialog box you see in Figure 8.2 changes when opened 
in other programs. In Figure 8.2, the conversion settings options are specific only to Microsoft Word.

The Settings panel is the first of the four panels where you select options. At the top of the Settings 
panel is a pull-down menu for Conversion Settings. From this menu, you choose the same set-
tings as are used by Acrobat Distiller to convert the file to a PDF. If you want to edit the settings 
or create a new Adobe PDF Setting, click the Advanced Settings button to open the Adobe PDF 
Settings Adobe PDF Settings shown in Figure 8.3 enable you to make choices for attributes used 
to convert the document to a PDF.

248

 FIGURE 8.3
The Settings panel offers you choices for selecting the Adobe PDF Settings used to convert the file.
Options in the Settings panel are as follows:
 View Adobe PDF result. When the PDF is created, the document opens in Acrobat if this 
check box is enabled. If it’s disabled, the PDF is created and the Word file remains in view.
 Prompt for Adobe PDF filename. If this check box is enabled, you won’t inadvertently 
overwrite a file with the same name. Leaving this check box enabled is a good idea.
 Convert Document Information. This option ensures document information created in 
Word is added to the PDF Document Properties.
 Create PDF/A-1a:2005 Compatible file. Clicking this option automatically changes the 
Conversion Settings to the PDF/A-1a:2005(RGB) Adobe PDF Setting. The files are made 
compliant with PDF/A. Note that using PDF/A produces a PDF with Acrobat 5 compati-
bility; therefore, any features specific to PDF version 1.5 (Acrobat 6 and greater compati-
ble) files are lost in PDF/A-compliant files.
 Attach source file. If you want to attach the Word file from which the PDF was created, 
enable this check box and the Word file is added as a file attachment.
 Create Bookmarks. Bookmarks are created from Word style sheets. Select this check box 
to convert styles and headings to Bookmarks. Make selections for what styles and headings 
to convert to bookmarks in the Bookmarks panel.

249
Using Acrobat PDFMaker with Microsoft Programs

 Add Links. This option ensures that hyperlinks created in Word are converted to links in 
the PDF document.
 Enable Accessibility and Reflow with tagged Adobe PDF. This option creates document 
structure tags. Accessibility for the visually challenged and developmentally disabled that 
is contained in the Word document is preserved in the PDF. Reflowing text enables the 
Acrobat user to use the Reflow view. As a matter of default, leave this check box enabled. 
Tagged PDF documents also help you export the PDF text back out to a word processor 
with more data integrity than when exporting files without tags.
NOTE
NOTE
If you enable accessibility and reflow, the file sizes of your PDF documents are 
larger compared to files exported to PDF without accessibility and tags. If you need 
to produce the smallest file sizes for specific purposes where you know accessibility and pre-
serving structure are not needed, disable the check box.
Security
Click the Security panel to open options for security settings. Security options for permissions are 
available only for High-Bit encryption (128-bit RC4). If you choose to add security from the Word 
options, the PDF document is compatible with Acrobat 5.0 viewers and greater. If you need addi-
tional security controls available in Acrobat 6, Acrobat 7, and Acrobat 9 compatibility options, apply 
the security in Acrobat.

Part II
Options on the Word panel are as follows:
 Convert displayed comments to notes in Adobe PDF. Notes can be converted to anno-
tation comments that will appear in a text note in the PDF file.
 Convert footnote and endnote links. Bookmark links are added for all footnotes and 
endnotes.
 Enable advanced tagging. The tagging features available in Word that export to PDF have 
been split for accessibility with the Enable Accessibility and Reflow with tagged Adobe 
PDF files you see in Figure 8.4. This option adds settings over and above document acces-
sibility. Checking this box adds document structure for character styles such as underlines, 
superscript, subscript, outline, strikeouts, and so on that can be useful when exporting 
PDF files back to text such as exporting to Word or RTF formats. The downside for 
selecting this check box is that the PDF conversion will take longer and the file sizes will 
grow. Unless you anticipate a need for adding this kind of document structure in your 
converted files, leave the check box unchecked.
 Comments. The lower window lists all comments by author in the file. If you check the 
box in the Include column, the comments are converted to Acrobat comments. The Notes 
open column enables you to set the default for note comments with open note pop-up 
windows.
TIP
TIP
If you have a document with comments added by several individuals and you want 
each person’s comments appearing with different note colors, click the icon in the 
Color column to change color. Keep clicking the icon to continue changing color. Word scrolls 
through eight different colors as you keep clicking the mouse.
Bookmarks
In the Bookmarks panel, there are three items that can determine what bookmarks will be created 
in the PDF file:
 Convert Word Headings to Bookmarks. Word headings can be converted to bookmarks. 
In the box below the check boxes, a list of all headings and styles contained in the Word 
document appears. Click the box under the Bookmark column to determine what heads 
to convert to bookmarks.
 Convert Word Styles to Bookmarks. You can select user-defined styles for conversion 
to bookmarks. Scroll the list of elements and place a check mark for the styles you want 
to convert.
 Convert Word Bookmarks. Converts all bookmarks created in Word to PDF bookmarks.
Click the number appearing in the Levels column and a pop-up menu becomes visible. Click the 
down-pointing arrow to open the menu and select the level of nesting for the bookmarks as shown 
in Figure 8.5. The nesting order you determine here in the Acrobat PDFMaker settings dialog box 
determines the order of parent/child relationships in the Acrobat Bookmarks panel when the file is 
converted to PDF. (See Figure 8.6.)

Unless you have a definite need for converting styles in some Word documents, stick with the 
Convert Word Headings to Bookmarks option and convert the heads to bookmarks.
After you select the options in the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box, click the Convert to PDF tool 
or select the menu option to convert the file. In Figure 8.6, I converted a file having three levels of 
heads. Notice that when the Bookmarks panel is open, you see the bookmarks nested into parent/
child relationships.

Video
The Video panel in Acrobat PDFMaker offers some choices for importing video files in a Word docu-
ment. Click the Video tab and the options shown in Figure 8.7 include:
 Location. The video can be stored in the same folder as the Word document or a folder 
you choose by clicking the Browse button.
 Quality. From the Video Quality pull-down menu choose a quality setting for the video 
playback. If the video file is interlaced, an option to deinterlace the file is included below 
the menu.
 Encode Audio. Choose from options in the pull-down menu for audio quality.

Working with comments (Windows)
Move to the right on the Ribbon and in the Review and Comment area you find Acrobat Comments. 
Clicking this button opens a pull-down menu as shown in Figure 8.8. The commands in the menu 
address merging your PDF comments back into the original Microsoft Word document. The 
menu items are as follows:
 FIGURE 8.8
Click Acrobat Comments to open the pull-down menu for managing comments.
 Import Comments from Acrobat. This is a round trip process — that is, you need to start 
with a Microsoft Word document, send it out to be reviewed, and then merge the received 
comments back into the Word file. In addition, when you created the PDF file in the first 
place, you must use PDFMaker. When you select the menu item, the Import Comments 
from Adobe Acrobat help window opens. Read the helpful tips on how to import comments 
and click OK to proceed. The next dialog box that opens is Import Comments from 
Adobe Acrobat, as shown in Figure 8.9. In the dialog box, you make choices for what 
files to select, what comments to import, and whether you want to filter the comments.
 FIGURE 8.9
The Import Comments from Adobe Acrobat dialog box offers choices for file selection 
and the comment types to import into the Word document.

 Continue Integration Process. This continues the integration of PDF comments in the 
Word document for text edits such as inserts and deletions. If review tracking is on, you 
can merge tracked changes.
 Accept All Changes in Document. After the comment integration, select this menu com-
mand to accept the comments. Comments such as text marked for deletion are deleted; 
text marked with insertion adds the inserted comments; and so on.
 Delete All Comments in Document. All comments imported from the PDF document 
are deleted from the Word file.
 Show Instructions. The dialog box that opens when you choose the Import Comments 
from Acrobat command (see the first bullet in this list) also opens when you choose the 
Show Instructions menu command.
To make the process for importing comments from Acrobat easier (or Exporting comments from 
Acrobat to Word), take a look at the steps that follow, which describe a workflow for exchanging 
comments in Word and PDF documents.
STEPS: Integrating Acrobat comments in Word documents 
(Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended — Windows Only)
 
1. Convert a Word document to PDF using the PDFMaker Create PDF Tool. Be certain 
to use PDFMaker to convert your Word file to PDF.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
You must be certain to check Enable Accessibility and Reflow with tagged Adobe 
PDF in the Settings panel in order to export/import comments between Acrobat 
PDF and Word files.
 
2. Mark up the PDF file in Acrobat using the Comment & Markup tools. Be certain to 
use the Text Edits tools in the Comment & Markup toolbar to comment on the PDF file. 
Text Edit comments get merged directly into the Microsoft Word document stream, 
whereas other comments are just applied as note comments in Word.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on commenting and using the Text Edits tools, see Chapter 20.
 
3. Initiate an export of comments to Word. You can export comments from Acrobat to 
Word or Import comments in Word from a PDF file. In Acrobat you use the Comments ➪ 
Export Comments to Word menu command. In Word you use the Acrobat 
Comments ➪ Import Comments from Acrobat menu command. Either menu selection 
opens the Import Comments from Adobe Acrobat dialog box. If you start in Acrobat, 
Microsoft Word is launched and the Import Comments from Adobe Acrobat Wizard is 
handled from within Word. The first dialog box describes the process for integrating your 
PDF comments back to a Word document. Click OK after reading the help information.
 
4. Choose files and comment types. The second dialog box is the Import Comments from 
Adobe Acrobat Wizard shown earlier in Figure 8.9. Choose the Word file you want to use 
for exporting comments and click OK.

255

5. Import the comments. Your comments are imported into the Word document in a 
seamless operation. After all the comments are imported you should see the Successful 
Import dialog box open, as shown in Figure 8.10.
 FIGURE 8.10
If your comments are successfully imported, the Successful Import dialog box opens.
 
6. Integrate Text Edits. Open the Acrobat Comments pull-down menu in the Ribbon and 
choose Continue Integration Process. Another dialog box opens as shown in Figure 8.11 
where you can selectively choose comments to integrate or click the Apply All Remaining 
button to integrate all Text Edits. After the comments are integrated another dialog box 
opens and reports the results. Click Done and your integration is complete.

Working with custom page sizes
The most common page size and output for Word files is standard letter or A4 page sizes that are 
printed to desktop printers. On occasion, documents are created for output to commercial printing 
equipment. Manuals, reports, books, and more are sometimes designed for printing on commercial 
printing machines for offset press or on-demand printing.
PDF WORKFLOW
PDF WORKFLOW Whereas Microsoft Word is a superb word processor, the program was never 
designed to be a page layout application to prepare files for commercial printing 
equipment. Word does not support roll-fed machines, adding printer’s marks, managing color, 
separating color images, halftone frequencies, and so on, that are all part of the tools you find in 
professional layout applications such as Adobe InDesign. When choosing a program where files 
need to be delivered to commercial print shops, use a program like Adobe InDesign or 
Microsoft Publisher.
A few problems arise when Word files are created for this kind of output. The first problem is out-
putting documents using nonstandard page sizes. If you set up a document for a 7-×-9-inch page 
size for example, Word doesn’t have a matching page size available in the print dialog box. As a 
result, you need to create a custom page size to format the document and print the custom-formatted 
page size.
Second, files need to be printed with crop marks so the print shop knows where to cut the paper 
when it comes off press. As a word processor, Word is not designed for use as a page layout program. 
Professional layout programs such as Adobe InDesign have all the tools and features you need to 
print documents with crop marks and other attributes designed for output on commercial printing 
equipment.
One solution is to take the Word document and import it into a program such as Adobe InDesign. 
But doing so requires a lot of work on your part. You have to reformat the document for a custom 
page size before you can print it. Fortunately, there’s a much easier way. You can format the docu-
ment in Word with a custom page size, export to PDF using PDFMaker, and use Acrobat to create 
the necessary crop marks and make the file print-ready.
The steps for setting up custom page sizes differ a little between Windows and the Macintosh. Let’s 
first take a look at creating custom pages on Windows, and then I’ll move on to creating custom 
page sizes on the Mac.
Creating custom page sizes on Windows
On Windows you have two different ways to configure Word for formatting and printing custom 
page sizes. You can use the Page Setup dialog box in Word to create a custom page size, or you can 
add a custom page size to your printer driver. Adding a custom page size to the printer driver makes 
that page size available to all applications using the driver. Creating the custom page size in Word 
limits the page size to Word files.
For a more flexible use, create a custom page size in the Adobe PDF printer driver and you’ll have 
the page size available for use with all applications. Here’s how to do it.

STEPS: Creating custom page sizes in the print driver
 
1. Open the Adobe PDF Properties. From the Start menu select Settings ➪ Printers and 
Faxes. You should see icons for all printing devices installed on your computer when the 
Printers and Faxes window opens. Among the printer drivers, you’ll find the Adobe PDF 
printer driver. Select this driver and either select File ➪ Properties in the Printers and 
Faxes window, or right-click the Adobe PDF driver to open a context menu and select 
Properties as shown in Figure 8.12.
 FIGURE 8.12
Open a context menu on the Adobe PDF Printer and select Properties.
 
2. The Adobe PDF Properties dialog box opens as shown in Figure 8.13. Note that the 
default tab selected in the Adobe PDF Properties dialog box is the General tab.
 
3. Open the Printing Preferences. In the Adobe PDF Properties dialog box, shown in 
Figure 8.13, click the Printing Preferences button. The Adobe Printing Preferences dialog 
box opens. In this dialog box, click Adobe PDF Settings, as shown in Figure 8.14.

4. Add a new custom page size. Click the Add button and the Add Custom Paper Size dia-
log box opens as shown in Figure 8.15.
 FIGURE 8.15
Click Add to open the Add Custom Paper Size dialog box.
 
5. Edit the Custom Page Size. Type the width and height values in the Width and Height 
text boxes and select the unit of measure from the three choices in the Unit section of the 
dialog box. Type a name for the custom paper size in the Paper Name text box. Use a 
name that defines the page size as you see in Figure 8.15.
 
6. Save the new custom page size. Click the Add/Modify button in the Add Custom Paper 
Size dialog box and you return to the Adobe PDF Printing Preferences dialog box. Click 
OK and your new custom page size is available each time you use the Adobe PDF printer 
driver.
 
7. Set up a Word document with a custom page size. Open Microsoft Word and open a 
file or create a new document.
 
 By default Word 2007 doesn’t have a Microsoft Menu ➪ Page Setup command. You may 
need to open the Microsoft menu and choose Word Options. In the Word Options win-
dow click Customize and select Page Setup in the left column. Click the Add button to 
move the Page Setup command to the Quick Access toolbar. Click OK and click the Page 
Setup button in the Quick Access toolbar. In the Page Setup dialog box, choose the cus-
tom page size you want from the Page Size pull-down menu as shown in Figure 8.16.
 
8. Convert to Adobe PDF. Click the Create PDF tool in the Acrobat Ribbon. If you enabled 
View Adobe PDF result in the Acrobat PDFMaker Settings tab, the resulting PDF opens in 
Acrobat.
NOTE
NOTE
Creating custom page sizes is particularly important for programs such as Microsoft 
Visio, Microsoft Project, and AutoCAD where nonstandard sizes are commonly used. 
Acrobat supports a page size of up to 200 inches square. Make certain you have the proper page 
size defined for the Adobe PDF printer before attempting to Create PDF.

In Microsoft Word, open the Page Setup dialog box and choose the new paper size in 
the Paper size pull-down menu.
Creating custom page sizes on the Macintosh
The process for creating custom page sizes on the Mac is much the same as on Windows, but the 
dialog boxes are a little different. For custom page size creation on the Mac, follow these steps:
STEPS: Creating custom page sizes on the Macintosh
 
1. Open Microsoft Word. You can create a custom page size on the Mac from within any 
program. Because we’re talking about Word here, I’ll use Word as my starting point with 
a document open in the Word window that I want to reformat for a custom page size.
 
2. Open the Page Setup dialog box. Select File ➪ Page Setup to open the Page Setup dialog 
box. In the Page Setup dialog box select Adobe PDF 9.0 from the Format for pull-down 
menu. Open the Paper Size pull-down menu and select Manage Custom Sizes, as shown 
in Figure 8.17. Making the menu selection for Manage Custom Sizes automatically opens 
the Custom Page Sizes dialog box.
 
3. Create a new custom page size. Click the plus (+) symbol in the lower left corner of the 
dialog box. Your new paper size is listed as Untitled. Double-click Untitled in the list to 
select the name, and type a descriptive name for your new page size. My preference is to 
use the paper sizes for names, as shown in Figure 8.18. Type the Width and Height values 
in the text boxes up in the top-right corner of the Custom Page Size dialog box.

261

 FIGURE 8.17
Format the page size for the Adobe PDF 9.0 printer driver and select Manage Custom 
Sizes from the Paper Size pull-down menu.
 FIGURE 8.18
Click the plus (+) symbol, type a name, and edit the Width and Height text boxes.
 
4. Use a custom page size. Click OK in the Custom Page Sizes dialog box and you return to 
the Page Setup dialog box. Select the Adobe PDF 8.0 printer and your new page size in the 
Paper Size pull-down menu. Your document is then reformatted for the custom page size.
 
5. Export to PDF. Click the Convert to Adobe PDF tool and your Word file is converted to 
PDF using the new custom page size.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
If you begin with a document created on a standard letter or other page size and 
reformat the document to fit on another page size, you should review all document 
pages. As the document is reformatted you may find page breaks, headers and footers, tables, 
and other document elements needing some adjustments before converting to PDF.

262

Adding crop marks to PDFs
Regardless of whether your files are formatted for custom page sizes or standard page sizes, you 
need to add crop marks if your files are going to be printed on offset press or many on-demand 
printing devices. For some on-demand equipment such as Xerox DocuTechs and other devices 
that print on single-sheet standard page sizes, you won’t need to add crop marks.
When crop marks are needed for printing your files, follow these steps to add crop marks in 
Acrobat.
STEPS: Adding crop marks to PDF documents 
(Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended only)
 
1. Open a document in Acrobat Pro. Or Pro Extended For these steps you need Acrobat 
Pro or Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows). Acrobat Standard (Windows) does not have a 
Print Production toolbar.
 
2. Open the Print Production toolbar. Open a context menu on the Acrobat Toolbar 
Well and select Print Production to open the Print Production toolbar. The Printer’s 
Marks tool and the Crop tool shown in Figure 8.19 are needed to add printer’s marks 
to your document.
 FIGURE 8.19
Open the Print Production toolbar from a context menu opened on the Toolbar Well.
 
3. Add Printer’s Marks. Click the Add Printer Marks tool in the Print Production toolbar 
and the Add Printer Marks dialog box opens. You can selectively add the type of marks 
you want to appear on your document by checking the various marks check boxes. In 
this example, I click the All Marks check box and all printer’s marks are added to the file. 
For the Page Range, leave the default All selection checked if you want all pages to appear 
with the printer’s marks as shown in Figure 8.20.

263
Using Acrobat PDFMaker with Microsoft Programs

 FIGURE 8.20
Check the boxes for the marks you want to appear on the PDF document and select the 
page range.
 
4. Crop the pages. When you click OK in the Add Printer Marks dialog box, you won’t see 
any changes in your document — that’s because the printer marks exist outside the page 
dimensions. You need to enlarge the pages so the crop marks are visible. To make the 
document pages appear larger, click the Crop Pages tool in the Print Production toolbar 
and the Crop Pages dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 8.21.
 
 Click the Custom radio button and type a width and height larger than the page sizes. As 
a standard page size to accommodate crop marks, add 1 inch to the page width and height. 
In my example, my document is 7 × 9 inches. Therefore I added 8 inches for the width 
and 10 inches for the height. Over in the Page Range area of the Crop Pages dialog box, 
click All to apply your marks to all pages.

264

Click Custom and type the new dimensions for width and height. Click All to apply 
marks to all pages.
 
5. Preview the PDF document. Click OK in the Crop Pages dialog box and the printer’s 
marks appear on all pages in the document. In Figure 8.22, the printer’s marks are shown 
on the first page in my document.

For more information on using the Print Production tools, see Chapter 32.
TIP
TIP
When you add printer’s marks to a document, the order in which you use the Print 
Production tools is critical. You must first use the Add Printer’s Marks tool followed 
by using the Crop tool. This order may seem counterintuitive and confusing. To help you keep 
the order straight, just remember to use the tools in the same order they’re displayed in the Print 
Production toolbar. The Add Printer’s Marks tool appears first, followed by the Crop tool.

Using graphics in Word
Microsoft Word is first and foremost a word processing program. Inasmuch as many features have 
been added to the program to take it well beyond simple word processing, the program is not 
designed to be a layout program. Word lacks support for many features you find with layout pro-
grams such as supporting color management, printing color separations, controlling halftone fre-
quency, and more.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on terms used in commercial printing such as color profiling, 
color separations, and halftoning, see Chapter 32.
As a matter of practice, you should avoid creating files for press, in particular for color separations, 
in Word. If it’s an absolute must that you need to use Word for commercial printing, then you need 
to be aware of some things to avoid. These items include the following:
 Use RGB images. Be certain to not use Indexed color images in your Word files. Make 
certain all your images are edited and saved in an RGB color space and let the RGB to 
CMYK conversion take place at the time the files are printed.
 Use TIFF format for raster images. Avoid using GIF, JPG, PNG, PCX, PICT, BMP, and 
other file formats. Use only TIFF as the format to import photos and raster images.

266
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
 Use EPS for vector objects. Again avoid using any other formats for vector objects and 
use only EPS for these graphics. Do not use the clip art you can import in Word. Create 
vector objects in a program such as Adobe Illustrator and save as EPS.
 Do not paste images in Word. Pasting images in Word converts files to Windows Metafile 
(Window) or PICT (Macintosh). These file formats won’t print properly on commercial 
printing equipment.
Again, I would caution you against using Word for printing files with graphics on commercial 
printing equipment. When you have no other alternative, make sure to follow the preceding tips.

and 32.
Converting Snippets to PDF
You may have a passage of text, a graphic image, a table, a footnote or some other portion of data on 
a page in MS Word and want just a selected area converted to a PDF document. If this is your task, 
just select the data you want to convert in your Word document and click the Create PDF button 
in the Ribbon. The Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box opens. Select Options.
The default for the Page Range is All, which of course means that all pages in the Word document 
are converted to PDF when you click OK. Notice the Selection radio button in Figure 8.23. When 
you select any data in a Word file, the Selection radio button becomes active. Click this button 
and your selected data are converted to PDF.
 FIGURE 8.23

Converting Microsoft Excel Files to PDF
When converting Microsoft Excel files, as with any other program using the PDFMaker, you’ll want 
to open the Acrobat Ribbon. As is the case with Word, the tools are installed in Excel after you 
install Acrobat. When you open the Acrobat Ribbon and compare the tool choices with the same 
Ribbon opened in Word, you see a few differences between the Ribbon tools shown for Word in 
Figure 8.1 and the Ribbon tools for Excel shown in Figure 8.24.
 FIGURE 8.24
The Acrobat menu as shown in Microsoft Excel
Notice the Mail Merge and Acrobat Comments tools are unique to Word and don’t appear in the 
Excel menu. The remaining tools are the same as you find in Word; however, when converting to 
PDF, you have some different options to choose from for creating PDF files from Excel.
Open the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box by selecting Preferences. The Acrobat PDFMaker dialog 
box opens, as shown in Figure 8.25.
Compare Figure 8.25 with the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box opened in Word in Figure 8.2. All 
the settings are identical in the Excel Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box as the same dialog box opened 
from Word with the exception of the last three items:
 Convert Comments. Check this box when you want Excel comments converted to 
comment notes in the resultant PDF file.
 Fit Worksheet to a single page. Check this box to avoid tiling individual worksheet pages.
 Fit to paper width. Check this box to fit the spreadsheet to the width of the document page.
 Prompt for selecting Excel Sheets. Check this box to individually select worksheets in a 
workbook you want converted to PDF. If you create workbooks with multiple worksheets, 
be sure to keep this box checked as a default.

To understand a little more about converting Excel workbooks to PDF, follow these steps.
STEPS: Converting an Excel workbook to PDF
 
1. Open an Excel workbook. Try to use an Excel file having several worksheets in a 
workbook.
 
2. Change conversion settings. Click the Acrobat tab in the Ribbon and click the Preferences 
button.. In the Change Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box select the check boxes for Create 
Bookmarks and Prompt for selecting Excel Sheets. You can additionally make other choices 
such as Fit Worksheet to a single page if you like. Click OK to return to the Ribbon options.
 
3. Convert to PDF. Click the Create PDF tool in the Ribbon.

4. Select worksheets. As soon as you make a choice to convert to PDF, a second Acrobat 
PDFMaker dialog box opens. Because you selected Prompt for selecting Excel Sheets in 
the first Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box, Acrobat prompts you to select the worksheets 
you want to convert to PDF.
 
 Click the Entire Workbook radio button if you want all sheets converted to PDF, or indi-
vidually select the sheets you want to convert and click the Add button. In my example I 
want to convert the first 5M sheet, the second 5M sheet, and the fourth 5M sheet you see 
listed in Figure 8.26. After making your selection(s), click the Convert to PDF button and 
your worksheet(s) is converted to PDF.
 
5. View the PDF. If you elected to view the PDF after conversion by selecting the View Adobe 
PDF result check box in the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box, your file opens automatically 
in Acrobat. If you didn’t check the box, open Acrobat and click the Open tool to locate 
and open your converted document. Click the Bookmarks panel and you should see book-
marks added for each worksheet in the converted workbook, as shown in Figure 8.27.

To open the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box, click the Acrobat tab in the Ribbon and click Preferences. 
When the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box opens you see four new items in the Applications settings 
that don’t appear in the Word or Excel Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box.
The items shown in Figure 8.28 include the following:
 Convert Multimedia. Imported media such as sound and video in PowerPoint files can 
be converted to PDF media.
 Preserve Slide Transitions. Slide transitions can be saved in the PDF file and viewed 
when you view the PDF in Full Screen mode in an Acrobat viewer.

 Convert Speaker Notes. Speaker notes are converted to PDF when you check this box.
There are a number of options and reasons why you might want to convert PowerPoint slides to a 
PDF slide presentation. In addition, Acrobat Pro Extended 9 users can use Adobe Presenter for add-
ing more effects to PDF files converted from PowerPoint. All you want to know about converting 
PowerPoint slides to PDF and using Adobe Presenter is covered in a separate chapter later in the 
book where I talk about PDFs and presentations.

Converting Microsoft Publisher Files
Microsoft Publisher is Microsoft’s effort at developing a more commercial and professional program 
designed for prepress and printing. Print shops and service bureaus shied away from Publisher in 
earlier versions for lack of essential tools such as adding printer’s marks, color separation tools, and 
changing halftone frequency. However, Microsoft continued development of the product, and the 
latest version of Publisher includes all the features needed for prepress and commercial printing.
Unlike Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, Publisher doesn’t have a separate Ribbon bar. From the top 
of the Ribbon, click Adobe PDF and a pull-down menu opens as shown in Figure 8.29. To open 
the Preferences similar to the Preferences button chosen in the other Office applications, choose 
Change Conversion Settings and the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box opens as shown in Figure 8.30.

When it comes to exports to PDF, Adobe supports some of the much needed file attributes required 
to print files on press. When you open the Acrobat PDFMaker from the Adobe PDF menu in 
Microsoft Publisher, the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box displays some settings choices not found 
in any of the other Acrobat PDFMaker dialog boxes.
NOTE
NOTE
When you first launch Microsoft Publisher after installing Acrobat, you are prompted 
in a dialog box for enabling macros. Because the Acrobat PDFMaker is a macro, you 
need to grant permissions for using the macro or you won’t see the Adobe PDF menu or the 
Acrobat conversion tools.
As shown in Figure 8.30 you have some unique settings that apply only to Microsoft Publisher. 
These settings include the following:
 Conversion Settings. The default Adobe PDF Setting is Press Quality. Like the other 
Acrobat PDFMaker dialog boxes, you can change the setting by clicking the Advanced 
Settings button.
 Preserve Spot Color in Adobe PDF. If spot colors are used in the Publisher file, you need 
to check this box to preserve the spot colors. If you fail to do so, spot colors are converted 
to CMYK.
 Print Crop Marks. As you can see by comparing this Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box with 
the others shown for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, you see the first option for adding 
crop marks when a file is converted to PDF. This setting is very important if you have 
bleeds on pages in the Publisher document.
 Allow Bleeds. If bleeds are contained in the PowerPoint file, you must check the box to 
allow bleeds. When the box is checked, you have another setting to print separate bleed 
marks.
 Preserve Transparency in Adobe PDF. You can check the box to preserve transparency 
and let Acrobat flatten the transparency at print time.
The features added to the PowerPoint Acrobat PDFMaker are all related to commercial printing.

Microsoft Visio and PDF Creation
Engineers, technical professionals, and architects are among the many users of programs such as 
Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, and Autodesk AutoCAD. Each of these programs has an Acrobat 
PDFMaker to produce PDF documents. Inasmuch as you can either print PostScript or save as EPS 
from one or the other and distill the files in Acrobat Distiller, using PDFMaker is a much better choice.
AutoCAD and Visio offer options for converting the AutoCAD and Visio layers to PDF layers. It 
is critical to be certain that the Acrobat PDF settings are enabled for converting layers with either 
program.

274

Converting Visio files to PDF
Like all the other Microsoft programs, Microsoft Visio has an Acrobat PDFMaker set of tools and 
menu commands. When you open the Adobe PDF menu, you see a single addition for Visio appear-
ing as Convert all Pages in Drawing. Selecting this menu command converts all pages in the Visio 
file to PDF.
Additionally you have a Change Conversion Settings option in Visio like Microsoft Publisher. Select 
Adobe PDF ➪ Change Conversion Settings and the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box shown in Figure 
8.31 opens.
 FIGURE 8.31
Acrobat PDFMaker preferences (or conversion settings) opened in Microsoft Visio
The settings unique to Visio are as follows:
 Include Visio custom properties as object data in the Adobe PDF. Programs such as 
Visio and AutoCAD support adding asset information on all the objects added to drawings. 
The metadata are hidden from view in the drawing itself. When the PDF is produced, the 
object data are not visible in Acrobat in the document pane. However, a special tool known 
as the Object Data tool in Acrobat and the free Adobe Reader lets you view, search, count, 
select, and copy metadata. In Acrobat you can also export the metadata as XML. Check 
this box if you want to use the Object Data tool in Acrobat to work with the metadata.

 Convert Comments to Adobe PDF Comments. Comments added to a Visio file can be 
converted to Adobe PDF Comments.
 Always flatten layers in Adobe PDF. Microsoft Visio supports layers. If you want to 
retain layers in the resultant PDF, be certain to keep this check box unselected. You can 
keep the check box unselected as a default and when the need arises to flatten layers, you 
can handle layer flattening in Acrobat.

this box sets the Initial View in Acrobat to view the Layers panel and Page, where the 
Layers panel is opened when the PDF is opened in Acrobat.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more on setting Initial Views, see Chapter 5.
Notice that the default Conversion Settings in Figure 8.31 use the Standard Adobe PDF setting. 
This setting is Acrobat6–compatible. In earlier versions of Acrobat you had to edit the conversion 
settings in the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog box and be certain you selected Acrobat 6 or greater com-
patibility. Failure to do so flattened layers in the resultant PDF. In Acrobat 9, you don’t have to worry 
about changing your Adobe PDF Settings to Acrobat 6 or greater compatibility. When you click 
select Adobe PDF ➪ Convert to Adobe PDF, you are presented first with a dialog box asking you if 
you want to Include Custom Properties. Click Continue and you proceed to an advanced Acrobat 
PDFMaker dialog box. Click the Retain all layers radio button and the file is created with the Visio 
layers converted to Adobe PDF layers.
After converting a Visio document to PDF with layers, the file opens with the Layers panel in view, 
as you see in Figure 8.32.
Working with object data
Engineering and scientific programs often enable you to describe objects in drawings that result in 
object data that can be added to the metadata in a PDF document. When using Acrobat PDFMaker 
you can view certain metadata in the resultant PDF file.
 
 To view the data, open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and select the Analysis 
 toolbar. When the Analysis tools open, click the Object Data tool. Move to an object and 
click. The navigation pane opens to show the Model Tree, as shown in Figure 8.33. From the 
Options menu, you have a number of menu commands related to working with Object data.

the Options menu you have a number of commands available for copying data, selecting items, 
zooming views, counting objects, selecting similar objects, and so on. 
Converting Web Pages from Internet 
Explorer to PDF (Windows Only)
In Chapter 7, I talked about PDF conversion using the Create PDF From Web Page command. In 
Chapter 27 I talk about PDFs and the Web. But because this chapter is focused on using the Acrobat 
PDFMaker tool, I thought it best to talk about the Acrobat PDFMaker and Microsoft Internet 
Explorer here in Chapter 8.
If you’re working in an Acrobat session and you want to convert one or more pages to PDF, it 
makes sense to use the Create PDF From Web Page command. You don’t need to launch a Web 
browser and open a page you want to convert to PDF. You can do all that within Acrobat.
So why does Adobe supply yet another tool for Web page conversion to PDF? Because sometimes 
you browse the Internet and find a page you want to convert to PDF. Because you’re already in a 
Web browser, it makes sense to convert a Web page from the browser versus launching Acrobat 
and typing a URL in the Create PDF From Web Page dialog box.
As an example, let me share with you one Web page conversion I use routinely. When I book my 
airline tickets online, the ticket provider displays an itinerary showing my flight number, travel 
times, and travel dates. Of course the provider displays a print-ready Web page that I can send off 
to my printer, but I’m prone to losing things and printing paper is a surefire target for a lost item in 
my travel bag.
As an alternative to printing Web pages, I just do a quick conversion to PDF and copy my PDF to 
the laptop I carry to conferences and as a backup to a flash drive. When I’m in a hotel, I just open 
the PDF to check on my departure when I finish up my travels.
You may find many other uses for converting Web pages to PDF. Perhaps a map to a location, a 
latest recipe you saw on Emeril’s show, some research information you’re collecting, a new product 
description you want to study, or many other similar uses. Personally, I find it much easier to locate 
a PDF file on my computer than that last piece of paper I printed to my desktop printer.
Converting a Web page to PDF using PDFMaker
If you use Microsoft Internet Explorer on Windows, then you have the Acrobat PDFMaker installed 
in Explorer. In Internet Explorer you can click the pull-down menu adjacent to the Convert tool in 
the Internet Explorer toolbar to open the Adobe PDF menu and view the menu options, as shown 
in Figure 8.34. Notice in the menu you have a command for Preferences. Click Preferences in the 
menu and you find conversion options similar to those you use when creating a PDF from a Web 
page.

find with Web pages converted with the Create PDF From Web Page tool. Pages converted to PDF 
from Internet Explorer can also have additional pages appended to the converted file by selecting 
Append Next Level in a context menu, as shown in Figure 8.36.

Macintosh users may feel a little left out when converting Web pages to PDF from 
within programs such as Apple’s Safari. No PDFMaker exists on the Mac for Safari 
or Microsoft Internet Explorer. However, the Mac user can still create PDF documents from any 
Web browser. Just open a Web page and select File ➪ Print. In the Print dialog box click the PDF 
button to open a pull-down menu and select Save as PDF. Your Web page is converted to PDF 
when you save the file. You don’t have an option for appending Web pages as the Windows 
users have when using PDFMaker, but you can always use either the Create PDF From Web 
Page tool or navigate to other Web pages and print them to PDF.
Converting Web Page selections to PDF
At times you may want to use a portion of a Web page and convert it to PDF. You might find an 
airline schedule from your town to other cities and want just the information for departures from 
your town. You don’t need a long table of flight schedules departing from other areas in the coun-
try. You may find a list of recent DVD releases and only want to select a few from a long list on a 
huge Web page, or you might want to capture a table without all the text preceding and following 
the table. These circumstances are ideal candidates for converting partial data on a Web page to a 
PDF document, and Acrobat 9 supports your every desire when using Microsoft IE and Acrobat.

To convert a selection on a Web page to a PDF file, follow these steps.
Steps: Converting Web Page selections to PDF (Windows only)
 
1. Open a Web page in Microsoft Internet Explorer. Note that these steps pertain only to 
Microsoft Internet Explorer on Windows.
 
2. Drag through the content you want to convert to a PDF file. You can drag through 
text and images, tables, and form fields on a Web page to select the data you want to con-
vert to PDF.
 
3. Open a context menu on the selection. Right-click the mouse button to open a context 
menu on the selection as shown in Figure 8.37.
 FIGURE 8.37
Create a selection and open a context menu.
 
4. Convert to PDF. From the context menu options, choose Convert to Adobe PDF.
 
5. View the resultant PDF in Acrobat. PDFMaker converts the selection to a PDF file and 
opens in your Acrobat viewer as shown in Figure 8.38.
 FIGURE 8.38
Only the selected data is converted to a PDF file.

Notice in Figure 8.37 you see a Select button adjacent to the Convert button in Internet Explorer. 
Click this button and you can select sections on a Web page to convert to PDF. While the Select 
button is active, click an area on a Web page. Move to another area and click again. When you 
click the Convert to PDF button or choose Convert to PDF from a context menu, all the items you 
selected are converted to PDF.
If you want to deselect items, click the Select button again and the PDFMaker deselects all selected 
items. You can then click the Select button again and start over selecting items for conversion to PDF.
Converting Microsoft Outlook Emails 
to PDF (Windows Only)
Acrobat PDFMaker is also installed with Microsoft Outlook. When you open Outlook, you’ll find 
two tools in the toolbar installed by Acrobat.
 
 The first tool is the Create Adobe PDF from selected messages, and the second tool is Create 
 Adobe PDF from folders. To convert mail messages listed in the Outlook Inbox or other mail-
box, select messages you want to convert to PDF. You might have a mail thread related to a specific 
topic where you want to archive all mail related to the given topic. Use the Shift key or Control key 
to select messages in the mailbox you want to archive. After selecting the messages, click the Create 
Adobe PDF from selected messages tool. The Save Adobe PDF File As dialog box opens as shown 
in Figure 8.39.
 FIGURE 8.39
Click Create PDF from selected messages to open the Save Adobe PDF File As dialog box.
Click the Save button after identifying a target folder for the saved file and PDFMaker converts 
your selected messages to PDF. The final result is a PDF Portfolio as shown in Figure 8.40. In the 
PDF Portfolio you’ll find each message converted to a PDF file. You can search the content of the 
portfolio and find results based on text searches. The PDF Portfolio provides you with many 
options for viewing, modifying, and managing your converted messages.

Summary
 Microsoft Office applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint export directly to 
PDF with the assistance of PDFMaker. Office applications retain document structure and 
convert structured elements to bookmarks and links in exported PDFs when Acrobat 
PDFMaker is used.
 Custom page sizes can be added to the Adobe PDF printer driver on both Windows and 
Macintosh.
 The Print Production tools can add printer marks and crop marks to PDF files.
 Acrobat PDFMaker for Microsoft Publisher supports many features used for commercial 
printing.
 Microsoft Visio files can be exported with Adobe PDF layers using PDFMaker in Visio.
 Object Data contained in programs supporting the inclusion of certain metadata can be 
viewed using the Object Data tool in the Analysis toolbar.
 Microsoft Internet Explorer supports PDF-creating with PDFMaker very similar to PDFs 
produced with Create PDF From Web Page.
 New in Acrobat 9 you find an option for converting selected portions of a Web page to 
PDF using a context menu command.
 Microsoft Outlook files can be converted to PDF and assembled in PDF Portfolios using 
PDFMaker in Outlook.

hapter 7 covered PDF creation from all the supported file formats 
contained in the Convert to PDF preferences. In Chapter 8 you 
learned about using the PDFMaker with Microsoft programs. Other 
PDF creation tools exist with programs such as QuarkXPress, CorelDraw, 
and Lotus Notes, and the list of programs supporting PDF creation continues 
to grow.
Where PDF exports from host applications are best is with Adobe’s own 
Creative Suite applications. Many of the Adobe CS programs were created 
from the ground up using core PDF technology.
This chapter deals with PDF exports from the Creative Suite programs. Some 
options you find with exports to PDF in Adobe Programs are supported in 
other applications, but none have as comprehensive a set of PDF export 
choices as do the Adobe programs. If you’re a user of any one of the Creative 
Suite applications, then this chapter is for you.
Setting Up the Environment
This chapter is concerned with creating PDFs; therefore, no toolbars need to 
be loaded in the Toolbar Well. You can leave your toolbars in Acrobat set 
to the default view to follow what’s covered in this chapter.

Working with Acrobat and the 
Adobe Creative Suite
The Adobe Creative Suite (CS4) comes in several flavors. The Creative Suite Design Standard edition 
includes Adobe Illustrator CS, Adobe InDesign CS, Adobe Photoshop CS, Adobe Bride CS, Adobe 
Device Central CS, Adobe Acrobat Pro, and Adobe Version Cue CS. The Adobe Creative Suite Design 
Premium edition includes all these programs but replaces Adobe Photoshop CS with Adobe Photoshop 
CS Extended and adds Adobe Flash and Adobe Dreamweaver and Fireworks . Additional Creative 
Suite bundles are the Web Premium, the Web Standard, the Production Premium, and the top 
end Adobe Master Collection that includes every program in all the other bundles. Most of the CS 
applications support PDF documents with direct exports and imports. For the remainder of this 
chapter I’ll refer to the CS4 and applications simply as the Creative Suite or CS programs. As of 
this writing, the current version is Adobe Creative Suite 4.
Acrobat and Adobe Photoshop
Adobe Photoshop CS supports creating and importing PDFs. When you create a PDF, you use the 
Save As command and save, and like all CS applications in the CS versions, the exports use Adobe 
PDF Settings to convert to PDF. When you import PDF documents that were not originally created 
in Photoshop, the files are rasterized. The process of rasterizing files converts all objects, such as 
type and vector objects, to raster images (pixels).
Saving to PDF from Photoshop
Creating a PDF file from Photoshop is nothing more than choosing the Photoshop PDF format from 
the Save dialog box. Photoshop supports many different file formats for opening and saving docu-
ments. In versions prior to Photoshop 6.0, you had to flatten all layers before you could save a 
document as a PDF file. In versions 6.0 and later, you can preserve layers and vector art. When 
you save a layered file from Photoshop CS as a Photoshop PDF and open it again in Photoshop, 
all layers are retained; however, a layered Photoshop file saved as PDF opens in Acrobat as a single-
layer document. Type and vector art work the same way. You can create type without rasterizing it 
and save the file as a PDF. Later, if you want to edit the file, you can reopen it back in Photoshop 
and edit the type. What’s more, you can search the text in Acrobat when you save the file as PDF 
from Photoshop.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Flattening layers in Photoshop always rasterizes vector art and type. If you want to 
preserve vector art and type, you need to save the layered file as a Photoshop PDF 
document. 

287
Exporting to PDF from Authoring Applications
9
To save a multilayered Photoshop image, Photoshop document, or flattened image, you use the 
Save As command. In Photoshop CS, choose File ➪ Save As. The Save As PDF dialog box opens. 
This dialog box is the same when saving from all other CS applications. If you’re familiar with 
Acrobat Distiller, the Save Adobe PDF dialog box and the various panes contained within appear 
similar to the tabs in Acrobat Distiller. However, while the CS applications use a similar UI for 
consistency, they do NOT use Acrobat Distiller to create the PDF.
When saving as Photoshop PDF, the first pane in the Save Adobe PDF dialog box is the General 
settings, as shown in Figure 9.1. Options choices you make in the Save Adobe PDF dialog box 
include:
 Adobe PDF Preset. All the presets you create in Distiller are available from the pull-
down menu. Any new presets created in Distiller are immediately made available to 
all CS programs.
 Standard. From the Standard pull-down menu you can select from the PDF/X subsets. 
 Compatibility. Acrobat compatibility choices are available from the Compatibility pull-
down menu. You find compatibility choices dating back to Acrobat 4 compatibility with 
all subsequent compatibility choices up to the current version when Acrobat was last 
upgraded. Because Acrobat’s development cycle usually is ahead of the CS programs, you 
find the most recent Acrobat compatibility choice for Acrobat not available until you see 
the next upgrade of the Creative Suite that follows the most recent upgrade to Acrobat.
 Description. This area in the General pane is a text description of the compatibility 
option you choose. 
 Preserve Photoshop Editing Capabilities. If you choose to uncheck the Preserve Photoshop 
Editing Capabilities and later open the PDF in Photoshop, the file is rasterized and all 
layers are flattened. Preserving Photoshop Editing Capabilities preserves layers and type. 
The type can be searched in Acrobat. If you don’t need to preserve type and vector objects, 
remove the check mark and flatten the file. Flattened images result in smaller file sizes.

For more on opening and rasterizing files in Photoshop, see the section “Acquiring 
PDF files in Photoshop” later in this chapter.
 Embed Page Thumbnails. As a general rule, be certain to leave this option off. This option 
was used for legacy formats and Acrobat no longer looks at embedded thumbnails. If for 
some reason you need to create page thumbnails, do it in Acrobat. 
 Optimize for Fast Web Preview. Keep this option checked to optimize files. When 
downloading from the Web, files are downloaded much faster.
 View PDF After Saving. Checking this option launches your default Acrobat viewer and 
opens the file in Acrobat.

 FIGURE 9.1
To export directly to PDF, use the Save or Save As dialog box in Photoshop. As with all other CS applica-
tions, the Save Adobe PDF dialog box opens.
Click Compression in the left pane to open the compression choices. The options shown in Figure 9.2 
include:
 Compression. In the Options area, leave Bicubic Downsampling To at the default. This 
option is likely to be the best choice for just about all your images. The two text boxes 
enable you to downsample images. For Photoshop files you’re best off changing resolu-
tion before you come to the save options. Leave these two text boxes at the defaults and 
use the Image ➪ Image Size command in Photoshop to make resolution changes.
 
Your choices include None, JPEG, JPEG2000, and ZIP. None adds no compression to the 
file. JPEG is a lossy compression scheme offering various levels of compression that you 
choose from the Image Quality pull-down menu. JPEG2000 requires Acrobat 6 compati-
bility or greater. Compression is greater with JPEG2000 than with JPEG. This compression 
scheme works with transparent layers and alpha channels. ZIP compression is lossless. 
Files are not compressed as much as with JPEG, but the data integrity is optimal. ZIP 
compression is usually preferred for images with large amounts of a single color.
 
Convert 16 Bits/Channel Image to 8 Bits/Channel. Sixteen-bit images, such as those created 
with 16-bit or more scanners or digital cameras supporting Camera Raw and 16-bit, cannot 
be converted to PDF using the Create PDF ➪ From File command. 16-bit images, however, 
can be saved from Photoshop as Photoshop PDFs and opened in Acrobat. To preserve 
16-bit images, save with Acrobat 6 compatibility or later.
 Tile Size. You’re not likely to use Tile Size, because Acrobat supports large document 
sizes when printing to large format printers. Use this option to print tiled pages on desk-
top printers when you want to piece pages together for proofs.

The last pane displays a summary of the settings you chose to use to export to PDF. Click Save 
PDF and the file is saved as a Photoshop PDF file.
Working with Photoshop color modes
Photoshop provides a number of choices for the color mode used to express your image. You can 
open files from different color modes, convert color modes in Photoshop, and save among different 
formats available for a given color mode. File formats are dependent on color modes, and some for-
mat options are not available if the image data are defined in a mode not acceptable to the format.
TIP
TIP
See Table 9.1, later in this section, for Photoshop PDF exports supported by the 
Photoshop color modes and relative uses for each mode.
Color mode choices in Photoshop include the following:
 Bitmap. The image is expressed in two colors: black and white. In Photoshop terms, images 
in the bitmap mode are referred to as line art. In Acrobat terms, this color mode is called 
monochrome bitmap. Bitmap images are usually about one-eighth the size of a grayscale 
file. The bitmap format can be used with Acrobat’s OCR functionality for converting the 
image data to rich text.
 Grayscale. This is your anchor mode in Photoshop. Grayscale is like a black-and-white 
photo, a halftone, or a Charlie Chaplin movie. You see grayscale images everywhere, 
including the pages in this book. I refer to this as an anchor mode because you can con-
vert to any of the other modes from grayscale. RGB files cannot be converted directly to 
bitmaps or duotones. You first need to convert RGB to grayscale, and then to either a bit-
map or duotone. From grayscale, although the color is not regained, you can also convert 
back to any of the other color modes. Grayscale images significantly reduce file sizes — 
they’re approximately one-third the size of an RGB file, but larger than the bitmaps.
 RGB. For screen views, multimedia, and Web graphics, RGB is the most commonly used 
mode. It has a color gamut much larger than CMYK and is best suited for display on com-
puter monitors. A few printing devices can take advantage of RGB, such as film recorders, 
large inkjet printers, and some desktop color printers. In most cases, however, this mode is 
not used for printing files to commercial output devices, especially when color-separating 
and using high-end digital prepress.
 CMYK. The process colors of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black are used in offset printing 
and most commercial output devices. The color gamut is much narrower than RGB; and 
when you convert an image from RGB to CMYK using Photoshop’s mode conversion 
command, you usually see some noticeable dilution of color appearing on your monitor. 
When exporting files to PDF directly from Photoshop or when opening files in other 

291
Exporting to PDF from Authoring Applications
9
applications and then distilling them, you should always make your color conversions 
first in Photoshop.
 Lab. Lab color, in theory, encompasses all the color from both the RGB and CMYK color 
spaces. This color mode is based on a mathematical model to describe all perceptible color 
within the human universe. In practicality, its color space is limited to approximately 6 
million colors, about 10+ million less than RGB color. Lab color is device-independent 
color, which theoretically means the color is true regardless of the device on which your 
image is edited and printed. Lab mode is commonly preferred by high-end color editing 
professionals when printing color separations on PostScript Level 2 and PostScript 3 
devices. Earlier versions of PDFs saved from Lab color images had problems printing 
four-color separations. With Acrobat, you can print Lab images to process separations.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on printing color separations, see Chapter 32.
 Multichannel. If you convert any of the other color modes to Multichannel mode, all the 
individual channels used to define the image color are converted to grayscale. The resulting 
document is a grayscale image with multiple channels. With regard to exporting to PDF, 
you likely won’t use this mode.
 Duotone. The Duotone mode can actually support one of four individual color modes. 
Monotone is selectable from the Duotone mode, which holds a single color value in the 
image, like a tint. Duotone defines the image in two color values, Tritone in three, and 
Quadtone in four. When you export to PDF from Photoshop, all of these modes are supported.
 Indexed Color. Whereas the other color modes such as RGB, Lab, and CMYK define an 
image with a wide color gamut (up to millions of colors), the Indexed Color mode limits 
the total colors to a maximum of 256. Color reduction in images is ideal for Web graphics 
where the fewer colors significantly reduce the file sizes. You can export indexed color 
images directly to PDF format from Photoshop.

Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
Acquiring PDF files in Photoshop
PDF documents may be composed of many different elements depending on the design of the original 
file. If you design a page in a layout program for which you create text, import Photoshop images, 
and also import EPS illustrations, the different elements retain their characteristics when converted 
to PDF. Text, for example, remains as text, raster images such as Photoshop files remain as raster 
images, and EPS illustrations remain as EPS vector objects. Although the images, text, and line art 
may be compressed when a PDF file/document is created, all the text and line art remain as vector 
elements. In Photoshop, if you open an illustration or text created in any program other than 
Photoshop, the document elements are rasterized and lose their vector-based attributes. Photoshop 
rasterizes PDF documents much as it does with any EPS file.
In Photoshop, you have several methods of handling PDF imports. PDF documents opened in 
Photoshop are handled with the File ➪ Open command, File ➪ Place command, File ➪ Import com-
mand, and through a File ➪ Automate command. Each of the methods offers different options, so 
let’s take the methods individually.
Opening PDF files in Photoshop
When you choose File ➪ Open, select a PDF file, and click Open, the Import PDF dialog box appears. 
If your PDF document has multiple pages you can select one, all, or any number of pages to open. 
Press Ctrl/Ô and click individual page thumbnails in the Import PDF dialog box shown in Figure 
9.4 to select pages in a noncontiguous order. Click the first page, press the Shift key, and click the 
last page to select all pages.
 FIGURE 9.4
The Import PDF dialog box enables you to pick the page number in a multi-page file to place in Photoshop.

293
Exporting to PDF from Authoring Applications
9
Options choices in the Import PDF dialog box include the following:
 Crop To. There are six choices you can make from the pull-down menu. For Photoshop 
files, the choices typically show no difference. Files are imported the same size no matter 
which option you select. The options are more significant when using Adobe InDesign.
 Resolution. The default resolution regardless of the size is 72 ppi. You can choose to 
supply a user-defined resolution in this dialog box. If the original raster images were at a 
resolution different from the amount supplied in this dialog box, the images are resampled. 
Text and line art will be rasterized according to the amount you define in the dialog box 
without interpolation.
NOTE
NOTE
Image resampling is a method for tossing away pixels (downsampling) or manufac-
turing new pixels (upsampling). Either way the process is referred to as interpola-
tion where Photoshop makes some guesses as to which pixels to toss or which pixels to create.
 Mode. Choose a color mode — Grayscale, RGB, CMYK, or Lab color — from the pull-
down menu.
 Bit Depth. Choose either 8- or 16-bit for the bit depth. If the PDF contains photos, chang-
ing an 8-bit depth file to 16-bit won’t add more data to the file. Any tone adjustments 
using Photoshop’s Levels and Curves result in the same data loss on 16-bit as you find 
with 8-bit images, if the original image file(s) was 8-bit.
TIP
TIP
For much better tone separation, working with true 16-bit images results in less 
data loss and smoother tonal transitions. You can convert 8-bit images to 16-bit 
in Photoshop. Open a PDF using the 8-bit option. Once opened in Photoshop select Image ➪ 
Mode ➪ 16-bit. Next, select Image ➪ Image Size and downsample the image 50 percent. Select 
71 percent for either the Width or Height and check the Resample check box. Use Bicubic for 
the method, click OK, and the image resolution is downsampled 50 percent. The pixels are com-
pressed in a tighter relationship, resulting in a true 16-bit image. The file now contains enough 
data to prevent data loss when making tone corrections with Levels and Curves. 
 Anti-aliased. Use this option to smooth edges of text, line art, and images that are inter-
polated through resampling. If you disable this option, text appears with jagged edges. 
Text in PDF files rasterized in Photoshop looks best when anti-aliased and when the 
display is more consistent with the original font used when the PDF was created.
 Suppress Warnings. Check this box to open the files without your having to respond to 
any warning dialog boxes that might report problems with the pages.
One problem you may encounter when rasterizing PDF documents in Photoshop is maintaining 
font integrity. Photoshop displays a warning dialog box when it encounters a font that is not 
installed on your system, which presents problems when you attempt to rasterize the font. If such 
a problem exists, the font can be eliminated from the document or changed after you open the file 
in Photoshop and edit the type layer.

any other application without a password to open the file. If you attempt to open a secure docu-
ment, an alert dialog box opens prompting you for a password.

PDF WORKFLOW
PDF WORKFLOW If you want to convert catalogs and lengthy documents to HTML-supported files, 
the PDF to PSD conversion can be useful. You can set up Actions in Photoshop to 
downsample images, convert color modes, and save copies of the converted files in HTML-
supported formats.
Placing PDF files in Photoshop
Instead of opening a PDF file through the File ➪ Open command, you can use File ➪ Place to add 
a PDF to an open Photoshop document. Placing PDFs in all versions of Photoshop prior to CS2 
rasterized the placed file. In Photoshop CS, placed PDF files retain all vector attributes. When you 
select Place, the Place PDF dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9.5. 
 FIGURE 9.5
The Place PDF dialog box lets you pick the page number in a multi-page file to place in Photoshop.
The file appears within a bounding box containing handles in each corner, as shown in Figure 9.6. 
Click and drag a handle to resize the placed image. You can size the image up or down in the 
Photoshop document window. When finished scaling, press the Enter (Windows) or Return 
(Macintosh) key. Pressing the key after sizing rasterizes the file. All vector attributes are lost and 
when you save the file as Photoshop PDF, you won’t be able to select text.

295

 FIGURE 9.6
Placed PDF files retain all vector attributes.
Using comments in Photoshop
Photoshop supports the use of Comment tools. You can create a note or sound attachment in 
Photoshop much like you do in Acrobat. The comment is an object and won’t be rasterized with 
any other Photoshop data. You can delete the annotation at any time by selecting the Note icon or 
Attach Sound icon and pressing the Backspace (Windows) or Delete (Macintosh) key.
You can also import comments from PDF files into Photoshop. You must use the Comment Note 
tool because Photoshop does not support the other comment types available in Acrobat. If a Note is 
contained in a PDF document and you want to import the Note into Photoshop, choose File ➪ 
Import ➪ Annotations. Photoshop can import an annotation only from PDF files.

For more information about comment notes and sound attachments, see Chapter 20.
Creating PDF presentations
All the features for Photoshop discussed thus far are derived from the top-level menu commands 
directly in Photoshop. You can also use Adobe Bridge to convert image files to PDF. Among 
options you find in Adobe Bridge is a command for converting image files to a PDF presentation. 
In the Bridge window you can select files to choose in your presentation, invoke a menu command, 
and Photoshop does the work to create a presentation complete with slide transitions and user-
defined time intervals. If you have Photoshop you also have Adobe Bridge. Open Adobe Bridge 
and follow the steps below to create a presentation.

STEPS: Saving a PDF presentation
 
1. Select image files to include in a PDF presentation. Open Adobe Bridge and open the 
folder containing images you want to include in a presentation. You can add files from 
other folders, but your task is a little easier if you first copy all the files you want to include 
in the presentation to a common folder.
 
2. Select Tools ➪ Photoshop ➪ PDF Presentation. With the files selected in the Bridge 
window, open the menu command, as shown in Figure 9.7.
 FIGURE 9.7
Choose Tools ➪ Photoshop ➪ PDF Presentation in the Adobe Bridge window.
 
3. Set the Presentation attributes. The PDF Presentation dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 9.8. Click Presentation for the Output Options and make a choice for the time 
interval for advancing slides by editing the Advance Every text box. If you want the pre-
sentation to run in a continuous loop, check Loop after Last Page. If you want transitions, 
select a transition effect from the Transition pull-down menu. Note that you can also 
click the Browse button if you want to add more files to your presentation than those 
viewed in the Bridge window.
 
4. Save the Presentation. Click Save and the Save Adobe PDF dialog box, shown in Figure 
9.1 at the beginning of this chapter, opens. Adjust settings as you like in the various panes 
in the dialog box. You might want to use some image downsampling in the Compression 
pane if you build a presentation from images taken with a digital camera. If you shot 
Camera Raw files with a camera of five or more megapixels, use the Compression options 
for lowering image resolution.

297

5. View the presentation. Click Save and Photoshop opens each image, samples the image, 
and converts to PDF. When the save is completed, open the file in Acrobat. Your presen-
tation appears in Full Screen mode and slides change according to the interval specified 
in Step 3.

program in non-PDF workflows embraces exports for Web design, where its current iteration 
supports one-step optimization for formats such as GIF, JPEG, PNG, SWF, and SVG.
Saving PDFs from Adobe Illustrator CS
To export PDF files from Adobe Illustrator, you use the File ➪ Save command. The format options 
available to you include the native Adobe Illustrator format (.AI), Adobe PDF (*.PDF), Illustrator 
EPS (*EPS), Illustrator Template (*AIT), SVG (*SVG), and SVG Compressed (*SVGZ). In Illustrator, 
choose File ➪ Save from a new document window. A Save dialog box opens that enables you to 
name the file, choose the destination, and select one of the formats just noted. 
Additional file formats appear in the Export dialog box (File ➪ Export). Formats supported in this 
dialog box include AutoCAD Drawing (*DWG), AutoCAD Interchange File (*DXF), BMP (*BMP), 
Enhanced Metafile (*EMF), Flash (*SWF), JPEG (*JPG), Macintosh PICT (*PCT), Photoshop (*PSD), 
PNG (*PNG), Targa (*TGA), Text Format (*TXT), TIFF (*TIF), and Windows Metafile (wmf).
If you choose Adobe Illustrator (.AI) as the file format and click Save, the Illustrator Options dialog 
box opens. In this dialog box you have an option to Create a PDF Compatible File. Check the box 
and click OK and your Illustrator document is saved in native format that can be opened directly 
in Acrobat. No other PDF conversion is necessary.
If you want to convert to PDF from a layered Illustrator document and have the layers appear in 
Acrobat, you need to save your Illustrator file as Adobe PDF. (*.PDF) When you select Acrobat 
PDF and click the Save button, the Save Adobe PDF dialog box opens with many similar settings 
found when saving Photoshop files.
A few differences appear in the Save Adobe PDF dialog box when you compare the options to 
Photoshop. These options are as follows:
 General. In the General tab you find two additional settings, as shown in Figure 9.9. The 
Create Acrobat Layers from Top-Level Layers check box is active for Acrobat 6 compatible 
files and later. Check the box when you want an Illustrator file exported to PDF with 
Adobe PDF Layers.
 FIGURE 9.9
Two additional options appear in the Illustrator Save Adobe PDF General settings when 
comparing the options to those found in Photoshop.
 
The Create Multi-page PDF from Page Tiles is used for creating multiple pages in 
Illustrator (see “Creating multi-page PDFs” later in this chapter).

 Compression. The appearance of the Compression pane is different than Photoshop, 
but you have all the options for downsampling files and the same compression options as 
found in Photoshop.
 Marks and Bleeds. Click Marks and Bleeds in the left pane and the options in the right 
pane change to settings you can apply for setting printer’s marks. Options are similar to 
those you find when setting marks in the Acrobat Print dialog box.

Saving layered files to PDF
You can save layered Illustrator CS files to PDF with Adobe PDF Layers. Creating layered PDF doc-
uments from Illustrator is supported in Illustrator CS version 1 and above. To create PDF layers 
you need an authoring program capable of creating layers and capable of saving or exporting to 
PDF 1.5 format (Acrobat 6 compatibility) and above — Illustrator CS does both.

When saving files with layers to PDF, create the default layer view you want to appear in Acrobat. 
As shown in Figure 9.11, one layer in an Illustrator file is hidden and four layers are visible. The 
layer visibility you see in Illustrator is the same visibility you’ll see in Acrobat when saving as PDF.
In Illustrator, choose File ➪ Save or Save As and select PDF as the format. In the Adobe PDF 
Options dialog box select Acrobat 6 or greater compatibility and check the box for Create Acrobat 
Layers from Top-Level Layers. If the box is not checked, you won’t see layers in the resultant PDF 
document.
When you open the PDF in Acrobat, you see the same layer view as when the file was saved from 
Illustrator, as shown in Figure 9.12.

Creating multi-page PDFs
Quite often, with just about any application, users find ways to work with a program in a manner 
that was not intended by a developer. This is most apparent when looking at the way designers 
use Adobe Illustrator. Illustrator was created for artists who needed an electronic artboard to create 
illustrations and drawings. But when the program got to the hands of the graphic artists, it was fre-
quently used as a page layout program. For years graphic artists pleaded with Adobe to offer sup-
port for multiple pages. No matter how many rich features were added to Adobe InDesign (which 
was created as a page layout program), the die-hard Illustrator users never abandoned their favorite 
tool. Today, great numbers of designers still first grab Illustrator to create page layouts.
It wasn’t until Illustrator CS2 was released that Adobe responded. Perhaps not completely the way 
designers wanted to work with multiple pages, but in part, Illustrator now supports multiple pages. 
The only way you can create a multi-page document in Illustrator is when exporting to Adobe PDF.

302
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
Illustrator’s approach to multiple page documents is quite different from that of any other applica-
tion. If creating multi-page documents in Illustrator is your interest, follow the steps below:
STEPS: Creating multi-page PDFs from Adobe Illustrator
 
1. Set up the page size. For this demonstration I want to create four buttons to use in 
Acrobat as navigation buttons to move back and forth in a PDF document. Two buttons 
are needed for default appearances and two buttons will appear as rollovers so when the 
cursor appears over a button, the button color or shape changes — much like you find in 
Web page designs. Rather than create four separate files, I want to create a single PDF 
document with four separate pages.
 
 For buttons, my page size needs to be just large enough for all four buttons. When I select 
File ➪ New in Illustrator, I specify my page size for 2 inches by 2 inches. These dimensions 
are sufficient to create four pages each at 1 inch square. The Illustrator artboard can be 
set up as a single page only. The page will be tiled to produce individual smaller pages 
when you create the PDF file. Therefore, 2 square inches is large enough to create four 
separate pages each at 1 square inch.
 
 Note that you could create an artboard large enough to accommodate several letter- or 
tabloid-size pages if you want to use Illustrator for a traditional page layout.
 
2. Create the button icons. You can use font characters from Symbols, Wingdings, or other 
stylized fonts, draw shapes, or add symbols from the Symbols panel, and so on. In my 
example, I use some characters from the Symbol font that appear as left and right arrows. 
I copied the two characters and changed the color on the duplicated characters. All this is 
arbitrary. Feel free to use any design of your choice. The point is you need four images 
centered in four quadrants, as shown in Figure 9.13. Notice guidelines were drawn to 
help position the characters in each quadrant.
 
3. Set Print Attributes. Chose File ➪ Print and select Adobe PDF for the Printer and Adobe 
PDF 9.0 for the PPD at the top of the Print dialog box. Under the Media area, choose 
Custom and type 1 for the Width and Height. The Print dialog box General settings 
should appear, as shown in Figure 9.14.
 
4. Set the Tile attributes. Click Setup in the left pane of the Print dialog box and select 
Tile Imageable Areas from the Tiling pull-down menu. The tiled pages should appear 
with dashed lines in the page thumbnail preview, as shown in Figure 9.15. If you don’t 
see dashed lines, the file won’t export as multiple pages.

 FIGURE 9.15
Select Tile Imageable Areas and observe the preview to be certain the pages are defined

5. Click Done. Be certain to click Done and not Cancel or Print to preserve the settings. 
 
6. Save as Adobe PDF. You must use the Adobe PDF (*.PDF) file format. A Native 
Illustrator .ai format won’t produce multiple pages. Select File ➪ Save As and choose 
Adobe PDF (*.PDF) for the Type (Windows) or Format (Macintosh). Click Save and the 
Save Adobe PDF dialog box opens.
 
7. Check Create Multiple-page PDF from Page Tiles in the General settings. (See Figure 
9.9 earlier in this chapter.) Click Save PDF and the file is saved. 
 
8. Open the PDF in Acrobat. When the file opens, click the Pages pane. You should see 
four separate pages, as shown in Figure 9.16.
TIP

You can bypass the step to open the Save As dialog box by clicking Print in Step 5 
and simply print to a PDF document. Clicking Done sets up the pages for exporting 
to PDF and permits you to continue editing if needed.

A file like the one created in these steps can be used as button faces with button form fields. Rather 
than have four separate files, you can choose any image in a multi-page document to add as a but-
ton face in Acrobat. In the Appearance settings in Button properties the Select Icon dialog box lists 
all pages in a PDF document. You can scroll the elevator bar on the right side of the dialog box to 
view different pages, as shown in Figure 9.17.

Saving SWF files
Acrobat versions 6 and above support many different kinds of media formats including Adobe 
Flash SWF. Using Illustrator CS you can create vector objects as animated sequences to embellish 
PDFs such as forms, diagrams, electronic brochures, and similar documents where you want to 
add animation to amplify your messages. To understand a little more about saving SWF files from 
Illustrator and importing them in Acrobat, follow these steps: 
STEPS: Exporting SWF files to Acrobat
 
1. Create a sequence in Illustrator. Either draw vector shapes in Illustrator or drag a sym-
bol from the Symbols palette to the document page. The shape you create is on a layer. 
Duplicate the shape and paste it to a second layer. Continue adding new layers and 
shapes to complete a sequence. You can change size, rotations, or shape designs for each 
shape on a different layer. In my example shown in Figure 9.18, I created a shape on one 
layer and sized the objects up 25 percent on each new layer.
TIP
TIP
To easily create a sequence for motion objects, drag a symbol from Illustrator’s 
Symbols palette to the document page. Press the Control/Option key and click+
drag to duplicate the shape. Press Control/Ô+D several times to repeat the duplication. Select 
all the objects and open the Layers palette flyout menu. Select Release to Layers (Sequence) 
from the palette menu commands. All your objects are distributed to separate layers.

307

 Export to SWF. Choose File ➪ Export. In the Export dialog box, select Flash (swf) from 
the Format pull-down menu. Add a filename, select a target folder, and click the Export 
button. The SWF Options dialog box opens. 
 
 Choose the Export option. Choose All Layers to SWF Frames from the Export As pull-
down menu. Click the Advanced button to display the Advanced settings.
 
4. Set the SWF file format options. In the SWF Options dialog box shown in Figure 9.19 
are choices for the frame rate, exporting HTML-compatible files, and various appearance 
options. Be certain to check the box where you see Export Static Layers and make other 
choices as desired. Click OK to continue the export to SWF.
 
5. Save the Illustrator file. When you export to a file format from Illustrator, your file is 
not yet saved. If you want to return to the document to make additional edits, save the 
file. Choose File ➪ Save and save the file as an .ai file with Create PDF Compatible File 
checked.
 
6. Import the SWF file in Acrobat (Acrobat Pro/ Pro Extended only). Open the 
Multimedia toolbar and select the Flash tool. Drag a rectangle on the document page 
where you want to import the SWF file (or just double click the get the default size of the 
SWF file. Click the Browse button in the Insert Flash dialog box, locate your SWF file, 
and import it. When you import the SWF file, the first frame in the sequence appears 
within the movie rectangle, as shown in Figure 9.20.

Whether you create SWF files from Illustrator or Adobe Flash, the SWF file imports in Acrobat are 
the same. Use the Flash tool in the Multimedia toolbar and locate an SWF file on your hard drive. 
Open the file and choose Acrobat 6 compatibility. You can add play buttons in Acrobat to play, 
stop, pause, and resume, and add JavaScripts for a variety of different play options. You can also 
convert Web pages containing SWF files to PDF. When Web pages are captured using Acrobat, the 
SWF files play as movies in the converted PDF.

Opening Illustrator files in Acrobat
Illustrator native files do not need conversion to PDF to be viewed in Acrobat. Acrobat supports 
opening native Illustrator .ai documents. When you click the Open tool, choose File ➪ Open, or 
select Create PDF From File and select a native Illustrator .ai file, the file opens in Acrobat without 
conversion to PDF. All this is possible if the original Illustrator document was saved with an option 
for Create PDF Compatible File. When you save Illustrator files as native documents and click the 
Save button in the Save or Save As dialog box, the Illustrator Options dialog box opens, as shown 
in Figure 9.22. Under the Options, select the Create PDF Compatible File check box. You can then 
open the file in Acrobat without converting it to PDF.

Acrobat and Adobe InDesign
When it comes to original authoring programs to create designs for just about any use that ulti-
mately end up as a PDF document, my personal choice is Adobe InDesign. Whether it be a slide 
presentation, an Acrobat PDF form, a form that you use a PDF template for in Adobe LiveCycle 
Designer, a brochure, a pamphlet, or any other kind of document outside a simple office memo, 
InDesign is the premier tool of choice.
With Adobe InDesign you can create layered files, expand your design horizons to new levels, create 
bookmarks and hyperlinks, export movie and Flash files, and a number of different features you 
just don’t have available in any other application. With InDesign’s style sheets for cells and tables, 
and tools for creating forms and dynamic linking to Excel spreadsheets, this program puts a of 
control in your hands for superb PDF creation.
To export to PDF from InDesign, choose File ➪ Export. In the Export dialog box, select Adobe PDF 
from the Format pull-down menu and click Save. The Export Adobe PDF dialog box then appears, 
as shown in Figure 9.23. Options here provide some similar settings as you find with Adobe 
Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop as well as a number of additional attribute choices for handling 
files designed for print, Web hosting, and screen viewing. You can export Bookmarks that appear 
in the resultant PDF file, export interactivity with buttons and actions, export HTML and hyper-
links, and create PDF documents designed for commercial printing.

Exporting PDFs for print
The Preset pull-down menu offers you choices for several Adobe PDF Settings that determine how 
your PDF is created. Among those options are selections for PDF/X files. PDF/X is a format specifi-
cally designed for printing and commercial prepress. When you export to PDF/X, you resolve col-
orspace problems, transparency problems, and other potential problems faced when printing 
documents on commercial devices.
CROSS-REF

For a detailed explanation of PDF/X and Adobe PDF Settings, see Chapter 10.
Exporting Adobe PDF layers
Just as when exporting layers from Illustrator, you set the default layer view in InDesign that 
you want to appear in Acrobat as a default view. You can add interactive buttons in InDesign and 
export your interactive links that are also recognized by Acrobat. In the Export Adobe PDF dialog 
box shown in Figure 9.23, be certain to check the boxes for Create Acrobat Layers and the Include 
items such as Bookmarks, Hyperlinks, and Interactive Elements. Click the Export button to export 
your document to PDF. In Figure 9.24, a layered InDesign CS file with interactive buttons and 
imported video is prepared for export to PDF.

provide artists with tools to create effective presentations and electronic brochures that users who 
download the free Adobe Reader software can view.

Expanding your design horizon
Something InDesign provides you that isn’t available in any other program is a way to create a look 
where objects fall off the page when viewed in Acrobat viewers. As Brian Tamayo, a Dallas, Texas–
based designer who first discovered this InDesign anomaly, says, “Think outside the page.” Figure 
9.26 shows you an example of an object breaking a page border.

314

Part II
 FIGURE 9.26
Adobe InDesign is the only program that permits you to create objects that fall off a page when viewed 
in Adobe InDesign.
If you want to create a PDF document with a similar design, you need to use Adobe InDesign and 
follow these steps.
STEPS: Breaking page borders using Adobe InDesign
 
1. Open a Master Page. Open a Master Page in an Adobe InDesign document. This tech-
nique requires you to place the object you want to use for breaking a page border in a 
PDF file to place the image on a Master Page.
 
2. Place a graphic. Use File ➪ Place in Adobe InDesign to import a vector object or photo 
and place it on a Master Page.
 
3. Position the graphic. When you place a graphic and select it, a bounding box is shown 
with a midpoint square. The midpoint of the graphic must be inside a page border. Move 
the graphic so the midpoint falls within the page border.
 
4. Convert the graphic to a button. Choose Object ➪ Interactive ➪ Convert to Button. The 
object must be converted to a button to be shown in the resultant PDF file.

315

5. Save the file. Complete your design and assign the Master Page to one or all pages in 
your InDesign document and choose File ➪ Save.
 
6. Export to PDF. Choose File ➪  Export and select Adobe PDF from the Save as type 
(Windows) or Format (Macintosh) pull-down menu. Type a name for your file and 
click Save.
 
7. Enable Interactive Elements. In the Export Adobe PDF dialog box shown in Figure 
9.23, be certain to check the box for Interactive Elements. Click Export and view the PDF 
document.
TIP
TIP
If you want an object pushed outside the page border farther than the midpoint 
on a selected graphic, add a 1-pixel Photoshop file to your Master Page. Click the 
graphic and the 1-pixel image and group them. The midpoint will change. You can move a 
graphic well beyond a page if so desired by spacing the graphic and 1-pixel image apart from 
each other.
Using Acrobat with Non-Adobe Programs
A number of different application programs support PDF creation from file exports similar to the 
way Adobe handles exporting to PDF. Programs such as QuarkXPress, CorelDraw, and several 
others all have their own options for exporting native files to PDF. Many attribute choices featured 
in the CS programs are also available in those non-Adobe programs that export to PDF. You may 
need to poke around in the export dialog boxes to find various settings adjustments.
If you use a program that doesn’t support direct exports to PDF, you should use the Adobe PDF 
print driver to create the PDF file.

Summary
 Adobe Creative Suite is a sophisticated solution for file interoperability. All the CS appli-
cations export directly to PDF.
 Adobe Photoshop can export directly to PDF as separate files and presentations. 
Photoshop can open single and multiple PDF documents created by any producer and 
preserve text and vector art when exporting to PDF.
 Adobe Illustrator exports Flash and SWF () files that can be imported in PDF documents 
as movie files.
 Adobe Illustrator CS and Adobe InDesign CS export to PDF with layers intact.
 Adobe InDesign CS exports links, Bookmarks, and embedded media to PDF.
 Some non-Adobe programs offer export-to-PDF features similar to the CS applications. 
For those programs not supporting exports to PDF, you should use the Adobe PDF 
printer driver.

B
ecause PDF file creation has been much simplified in Acrobat 9, you 
may bypass thoughts of learning what Acrobat Distiller does and how 
PDF documents are converted with the Distiller application. If you 
remember the PDF conversion steps discussed in the previous three chapters, 
the Adobe PDF settings were mentioned many times. These settings apply to 
Acrobat Distiller, and also the conversion of documents for many options 
from within Acrobat and via exports from authoring programs. They all use 
the Adobe PDF settings.
In order to successfully produce quality PDF documents when using Distiller, 
you need to have a basic understanding of how Acrobat Distiller works and 
what the settings control in regard to converting files to PDF. In some cases 
Distiller works in the background using Adobe PDF settings you assign to 
the creation process. Therefore, it is essential that you know how to change 
settings and understand what options are available to you. In this chapter I 
cover some advantages of using Acrobat Distiller and discuss how to change 
the Adobe PDF settings.
Setting Up the Work Environment
You can access Acrobat Distiller in several ways. You can open Distiller from 
the Advanced menu command in Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro, and Acrobat 
Pro Extended, you can launch Distiller from the desktop, or you can drag 
and drop files to the Distiller program application. None of these methods 
require loading special tools.

When you convert files to PDF you can create a PostScript file in other applications and convert 
the PostScript to PDF using Distiller or Print to the PDF Printer. Therefore, the default view of the 
toolbars is all you need to follow the instructions throughout this chapter.
Understanding PostScript
Adobe PostScript is a page description language — that is, it describes the text and images on your 
monitor screen in a language. A raster image processor (RIP) interprets this language. Whereas 
PostScript is the language, the RIP behaves like a compiler. The RIP interprets the file and converts 
the text and images you see on your monitor to a bitmap image in dots that are plotted on a printing 
device. In the office environment, you won’t see a RIP independent of a PostScript laser printer you 
use — but it exists. It’s built into the printer. With high-end devices such as imagesetters, platesetters, 
large-format inkjet printers, on-demand printing systems, high-end composite color devices, and 
film recorders, the RIP is often a separate component that may be either a hardware device or soft-
ware operating on a dedicated computer.
One of the reasons PostScript has grown to its present popularity is its resolution independence. 
When you draw a Bézier curve, rectangle, oval, or other geometric object in a vector art authoring 
application, the resolution displayed by your monitor is 72 pixels per inch (ppi). This image can 
be printed to a 300 dots per inch (dpi) laser printer or a 3,600 dpi imagesetter. Through the reso-
lution independence of PostScript, essentially the computer “says” to the printer, “Give me all you 
can.” The printer responds by imaging the page at the resolution it is capable of handling. When 
the file is ripped, the laser printer RIP creates a 300-dpi bitmap, whereas the imagesetter RIP cre-
ates a 3,600-dpi bitmap.
With all its popularity and dominance in the market, PostScript does have problems. It comes in 
many different dialects and is known as a streamed language. If you have a QuarkXPress file, for 
example, and import an Adobe Illustrator EPS file and a CorelDraw EPS file, you’ll wind up with 
three different flavors of PostScript — each according to the way the individual developer handles 
its coding. If the same font is used by each of the three components, the font description resides in 
three separate areas of the PostScript file when printed to disk. PostScript is notorious for redun-
dancy, especially with fonts.
As a streamed language, PostScript requires the entire code to be processed by the interpreter before 
the image bitmap is created. Ever wonder why you need to wait while the RIP is churning for an 
endless amount of time only to eventually end up with a PostScript error or RIP crash? PostScript 
can’t begin plotting the bitmap image until the entire PostScript stream has been interpreted.

319
Using Acrobat Distiller
10
PDF, on the other hand, is like a database file — it has a database structure. PDF eliminates redun-
dancy with file resources. Fonts, for example, appear only once, no matter how many occurrences 
are actually used. In addition, PDF takes all the dialectical differences of PostScript and converts 
them to a single dialect. Whereas a PostScript file containing many pages requires the entire file to 
be downloaded to the RIP and ultimately printed, a PDF file is page independent in that each indi-
vidual page is imaged before proceeding to the next page. In short, PDF is much more efficient 
than PostScript for printing purposes.
Creating PostScript files
In some ways a PostScript file is very similar to a PDF file. If, for example, you create a layout in 
Adobe InDesign, Adobe FrameMaker, or QuarkXPress with images and type fonts, the document 
page can be printed to disk as a PostScript file. In doing so, you can embed all graphic images and 
fonts in the file. If you take your file to a service center, the file can be downloaded to a printing 
device. Assuming you created the PostScript file properly, the file prints with complete integrity.
On desktop printers, printing to a PostScript file is just like printing to a device. On printers in 
commercial imaging centers, there are additional requirements and considerations, including the 
following:

The following items address PDF creation for the purpose of printing files on com-
mercial printing equipment. For more information on commercial printing, see 
Chapter 32.
About Imaging Devices
I
magesetters are high-end devices ranging from $10,000 to over $100,000 and are usually found 
in computer service bureaus and commercial print shops. Imagesetters use laser beams to plot the 
raster image on either sheet-fed or roll-fed paper or film. The paper is resin coated, and both paper 
and film require chemical processing through a developer, fix, and wash much like a photographic 
print. The material is used by a commercial printer to make plates that are wrapped around cylin-
ders on a printing press. These prepress materials are an integral part of offset printing, and much of 
the printing performed today is handled from a form of digital output to material that is used to cre-
ate plates for presses.
Direct-to-plate and direct-to-press systems bypass the prepress materials and expose images on 
plates that are used on print cylinders or directly to the press blankets where the impression receives 
the ink.
On-demand printing is a term describing machines that bypass the prepress process by taking the 
digital file from a computer directly to the press. Depending on the engineering of the output device, 
the consumable materials may consist of toner (as used in copy machines) or ink (as used on printing 
presses).

n PPD device selection. PostScript Printer Description files are used with specific devices, 
and you should always use a device PPD when printing the PostScript devices having 
PPDs. Distiller PPDs are used only with Acrobat Distiller.
n Page size. With desktop printers, you often have only a few page sizes. With printers that 
have multiple trays or interchangeable trays, you select the appropriate page size for the 
tray used. With imaging equipment, you need to be certain the page size is properly 
selected to include all image data and printer’s marks. Assume for a moment a document 
is created in the standard page size for a letter (8.5 × 11 inches). However, to accommodate 
printer’s marks (registration and color bars), it turns out that the page area needs to be 
defined larger than a letter page. In the Paper Size area of the dialog box shown in Figure 
10.1, the word “Custom” appears, indicating the page is a custom size. The thumbnail in 
Figure 10.1 shows how the page fits within the defined size. In this example, all data and 
printer’s marks print within the defined page. If your page is too small, some clipping of 
the data occurs when printed or when a PDF file is generated.
n Font inclusion. You may need to specifically tell the host application to include fonts in the 
PostScript file. If the file is printed at a service center, you definitely need to include the fonts 
in the file you submit for output. If you distill the file in Acrobat Distiller, the fonts need to 
be loaded on your system in order for you to embed the fonts in the PDF file. When you 
have options in Print dialog boxes for font inclusion, always choose to embed the fonts.
n Screening. Halftone frequencies, or line screens, can be printed at different settings. With 
desktop printers the maximum line screen available for the device is often the default. 
600-dpi laser printers, for example, most commonly use a maximum line screen of 85 
lines per inch (lpi). With imaging equipment, you need to first know the requirements of 
the commercial printer and take his/her advice depending on the paper, press, and pre-
press material. Therefore, if your file is ultimately printed at 133 lpi, you must enter this 
value in the Print dialog box of the application creating the PostScript file.
 
Setting the halftone frequency is an important issue only if the PostScript file is down-
loaded to an imaging device where the default screens are not overridden by a technician. 
For files printed from Acrobat directly to printing devices, the technician who prints the 
file also sets the frequency in the Acrobat Advanced Printing dialog box.
 
Screening can also be a particular type relative to the printing device and RIP. Stochastic 
screening, Crystal Raster, AGFA Balanced Screens, and others are available from a PPD 
selection for a particular device. For these settings you need to contact your service center 
for the precise screening options needed and use a device PPD.
n Color. If separations are to be printed, you must make certain all identified colors are 
properly named in the host document. There is often an option in a Print dialog box to 
select separations. As you view a color list of potential separations, it is imperative to ver-
ify all colors appearing are those you specified in the document. If a spot color is in the 
current document, the color doesn’t print unless it is an identified color in the Print dialog 
box. Fortunately, in Acrobat 9 a method is available for previewing separations. Before 
sending files off to a service center, make a habit of previewing files for printing in Acrobat.

information.
Encoding
Encoding comes in two flavors: Binary and ASCII. Binary encoding results in smaller files and prints 
faster on PostScript Level 2 and PostScript 3 devices. As a default you’ll want to use binary encod-
ing if you see options in the Print dialog box to choose between ASCII and Binary. If no option is 
available for choosing between ASCII and Binary when you print a PostScript file, the file encoding 
defaults to Binary.
PostScript levels
PostScript originated sometime in 1976, and later it was updated to a version called Interpress 
at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Interpress was designed for output to early laser 
printers. Xerox abandoned the project, and two of the staff at Xerox PARC decided to take it forth 
and develop it. In 1981, John Warnock and Chuck Geschke formed Adobe Systems Incorporated, 
and Adobe PostScript was their first product.
On March 21, 1985, the digital print revolution was founded when Apple Computer, Aldus 
Corporation, Adobe Systems, and Linotype collaborated on an open architecture system for elec-
tronic typesetting. Later that year Apple Computer introduced the LaserWriter printer that came 

322

Part II
with a whopping 13 fonts fried into the printer’s ROM chips and a price tag of $6,500. If you were 
outputting to a PostScript device in 1987, when Adobe Illustrator first appeared, you may still be 
waiting for that 12K Illustrator file to spit out of your laser printer. PostScript Level 1 was a major 
technological advance, but by today’s standards it was painfully slow. Many in the imaging world 
remember all too well still waiting at 3:00 a.m. for the final file to print after ripping over eight hours.
In 1990, Adobe Systems introduced PostScript Level 2, which was a more robust version of PostScript 
and a screamer compared to the first release. In addition to speed, PostScript Level 2 provided 
these features:
n Color separation. In earlier days, color was preseparated on Level 1 devices. PostScript 
Level 2 enabled imaging specialists to separate a composite color file into the four process 
colors, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. Also, there was support for spot color in 
PostScript Level 2.
n Improved font handling. In the early days of PostScript imaging, there were more font 
nightmares than you can imagine. Font encoding for PostScript fonts handled a maximum 
of only 256 characters. Other font sets such as Japanese have thousands of individual 
characters. PostScript Level 2 introduced a composite font technology that handled many 
different foreign character sets.
n Compression. Getting the large files across a 10 Base-T network was also a burden in the 
Level 1 days. PostScript Level 2 introduced data compression and supported such com-
pression schemes as JPEG, LZW, and RLE. The files are transmitted compressed, which 
means they get to the RIP faster, and then decompressed at the RIP. In a large imaging 
center, the compression greatly improved network traffic and workflows.
In 1996, Adobe introduced PostScript 3 (note that “Level” was dropped from the name). Perhaps 
one of the more remarkable and technologically advanced features of PostScript 3 is the inclusion 
of Web publishing with direct support for HTML, PDF, and Web content. PostScript 3 also pro-
vides the ability to create In-RIP separations. When you send a PDF file to an imaging center using 
PostScript 3 RIPs you can deliver composite color files that are sent directly to the RIP where they 
are separated at the imaging device.
Using Acrobat Distiller Preferences
Acrobat Distiller is launched from within Acrobat. As a separate executable application, Acrobat 
Distiller can also be launched from a desktop shortcut or alias or by double-clicking the program 
icon (acrodist) contained in the Acrobat folder.
NOTE
NOTE
Acrobat Distiller is accessible from the Advanced ➪ Print Production ➪ Acrobat 
Distiller menu command. The menu to open Distiller is nested in a submenu in 
the Advanced menu. In versions 7.0 and earlier of Acrobat, Distiller was accessed from within 
Acrobat via the Advanced ➪ Acrobat Distiller menu command.

323
Using Acrobat Distiller

When you first launch Acrobat Distiller, it looks like a fairly simple application. Examining the 
menus immediately tells you there’s not much to do in the File menu. This menu is limited to 
opening a file, addressing preferences, and quitting the program. Distiller’s real power is contained 
in the second menu item — the Settings menu. The commands listed in this menu offer all the 
control for determining how PostScript files are converted to PDF.
Before making choices in the Settings menu, look over the options in the Preferences menu. When 
you choose File ➪ Preferences on the Distiller Window (Windows) or the top-level Distiller ➪ 
Preferences (Macintosh), a dialog box opens. The options available are listed among three groups 
that include Startup Alerts, Output Options, and Log Files, as shown in Figure 10.2 for Windows 
and in Figure 10.3 for Macintosh.
 FIGURE 10.2

startup and output options.

Part II
Startup Alerts
The two items listed in the Startup Alerts section of the Distiller Preferences dialog box have to do 
with your initial startup upon launching the Distiller application:
n Notify when Watched Folders are unavailable. This command enables Distiller to 
monitor a folder or directory on your computer or network server to automatically distill 
PostScript files placed in watched folders. In an office environment, you can have differ-
ent users create PostScript files and send them to a server for automatic distillation.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on working with watched folders, see the “Creating watched 
folders” section later in this chapter.
n Notify when Windows TEMP folder is nearly full (Windows only). Distiller needs 
temporary disk space to convert the PostScript files to PDF documents. If the available 
hard disk space on your startup volume becomes less than 1 megabyte, Distiller prompts 
you with a warning dialog box. Leaving this preference setting enabled is always a good 
idea. The amount of temporary space required by Distiller is approximately twice the size 
of the PostScript file being distilled.
Output Options
Output Options relate to what you intend to do with the PDF both in terms of where it is saved 
and what to do after conversion:
n Ask for PDF file destination. When enabled, this option prompts you for the location of 
the saved file.
n Ask to replace existing PDF file. Selecting this option warns you if a PDF of the same 
name exists in the folder where the new PDF is saved. If you want to use different Adobe 
PDF settings and create two PDF files, you may forget that you have a PDF with a filename 
the same as the new one you are creating. With this option, you are warned if Distiller 
attempts to overwrite your existing file.
n View PDF when using Distiller. After the PDF has been created, the default Acrobat 
viewer launches and the PDF opens in the Document pane.
TIP
TIP
If you are running Adobe Reader and Acrobat on the same computer, open the 
viewer you want to designate as the default viewer. When prompted to set the viewer 
as the default, click Yes in the dialog box. All subsequent PDF files are opened in the default 
viewer.
Log Files
A log file describes the sequence of steps used to produce the PDF file. The Log Files section offers 
an option for what to do with the log file: the Delete Log Files for successful jobs option. A log file 
is an ASCII text file detailing the distillation process. If an error is produced during distillation, the 
log file records the error even though the PDF is not created. Viewing the log file can be helpful in 

325
Using Acrobat Distiller
10
debugging problems with files not successfully being converted to PDF. If the PDF is successfully 
created, there would be no need to keep the log file on your computer. By default, you’ll want to 
enable this check box to eliminate the clutter.
Editing Adobe PDF Settings
Distiller can be assigned some custom settings and you can also choose from some preinstalled 
Adobe PDF settings. All settings are selectable from a pull-down menu. If you need to create some 
custom settings you open the Settings menu and select Edit Adobe PDF Settings.
Using the Default Adobe PDF settings
If your work can be satisfied using one of the preset settings, open the Default Settings pull-down 
menu, as shown in Figure 10.4. Select a setting you want to use and Distiller uses your selected 
setting as a new default. If you distill files from within Acrobat, the new default settings are used. 
Each time you open Distiller, you see the new default you last selected in Distiller. Open a 
PostScript or EPS file and the file is converted to PDF using the settings appearing in the Distiller 
window as Default Settings.
The Default choices for Adobe PDF settings when you install Acrobat are as follows:
n High Quality Print. The preset settings associated with this option are established for 
the highest-quality images for high-end digital prepress and printing. The lowest levels of 
compression and downsampling are used to preserve image quality.
n Oversized Pages. This option is designed specifically for PDFs of oversized pages that you 
might see from engineering drawings.
n PDF/A-1b:2005(CMYK). PDF/A is an ISO standard for archival purposes. Acrobat Distiller 
does a check to assure PDF/A compliance; hence you have PDF/A as an option choice. 
The CMYK version of the PDF/A standard is used with CMYK files.
n PDF/A-1b:2005(RGB). The same as the first PDF/A standard mentioned in the last 
bullet, this standard is used with RGB files.
n PDF/X-1a:2001. For prepress and printing, PDF/X files are streamlined for print output. 
PDF/X is an ISO standard. PDF/X files result in PDF documents that eliminate data not 
essential for printing. It does not mean the file sizes are necessarily smaller, but they are 
optimized for printing and produce fewer problems than non-PDF/X files. The PDF/X-1a 
format supports process (CMYK) and spot color.
n PDF/X-3:2002. Like PDF/X-1a, the file format is a subset of the PDF format. PDF/X-3 
files support ICC profile embedding. If working in a color-managed workflow, use this 
flavor of PDF/X.
n Press Quality. These settings are virtually identical to the settings for High Quality 
(see first bullet). The difference between the two is that when you use the High Quality 
settings, any fonts not available for embedding during distillation are noted in the log file 

326
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
but the PDF is produced without the embedded fonts. When you use Press Quality, the 
job cancels at the first encounter of a font not available for embedding and the PDF is not 
produced.
n Smallest File Size. The intent for this option is to produce files for Web hosting, email-
ing, and screen views. The name implies that the file sizes are very small, but in reality, 
you can create smaller file sizes by editing the downsampling of the images. The sampling 
resolution only downsamples files above 150 pixels per inch (ppi) to 100 ppi. You can 
create a new set for smaller file sizes and downsample all images to 72 ppi for Web host-
ing when the images don’t need to be displayed above a 100% view.
n Standard. The general-purpose setting and quite often the default when accessing set-
tings the first time in Acrobat is the Standard choice. For office desktop color printers, 
laser printers, photocopiers, and general-purpose printing, the settings create PDF files 
with no lower than 150 ppi resolutions and embed fonts when necessary.
If one of these preset conditions comes close to producing the type of PDF you want to create, 
but it doesn’t exactly meet your needs, go ahead and select that preset option and then choose 
Settings ➪ Edit Adobe PDF Settings to open a dialog box where you can make changes. When you 
finish editing the settings to your satisfaction, you have an opportunity to save your own custom 
preset file that you can access at a later time. There are six panes for which you can choose to 
change the settings — General, Images, Fonts, Color, Advanced, and Standards.
 FIGURE 10.4
Open the Default Settings pull-down menu and select the Adobe PDF setting you want to use to convert a

Each setting in the list of default settings has different attributes for PDF conversion assigned to the 
setting. You can modify the default settings or create new settings. The settings choices you have 
available are all accessed in the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box.
Changing Adobe PDF settings
Select Settings ➪ Edit Adobe PDF Settings in the Distiller window (Windows) or from the top-level 
menu bar (Macintosh). The Adobe PDF Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10.5. You 
have six categories from which to choose different settings options. The default is General, as shown 
in Figure 10.5, followed by Images, Fonts, Color, Advanced, and Standards. With the exception of 
the PDF/A Standard in the Standards tab, all settings are identical to the same settings in Acrobat 7.
 FIGURE 10.5
The default Adobe PDF settings for Press Quality
General settings
General settings are found under the General option in the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box (see 
Figure 10.5) and include the following options:

328
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
n Description. A field box at the top of the General pane is editable and enables you to add 
a message description about the new settings you create. Place the cursor in the field box, 
highlight any existing text, and delete it. Type your new description in the field box. When 
you save the new setting, the description is saved along with your chosen options.
n Compatibility. You have choices for Acrobat 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 compatibilities. 
Using earlier compatibility versions may affect the visibility of PDFs with earlier viewers. 
If you work in an enterprise where a large installed user base is using a particular version 
of Acrobat, create files for the compatibility version consistent with the site license of 
the Acrobat version. If you’re creating files for mass distribution, think about forgetting 
Acrobat 3 and 4 compatibilities and focus on versions 5 through 8. Be aware that if you 
create Acrobat 6 through 8 compatible files, users of earlier versions won’t be able to view 
your files. Excluding older versions is always a trade-off, and you need to clearly think 
about whom you want to target when distributing content.
n Object Level Compression. Compressed objects are consolidated into streams for more 
efficient compression. You have choices for applying no compression (Off) or using Tags 
Only. You can reduce file sizes by selecting Maximum for Object Level Compression.
n Auto-Rotate Pages. You can have pages automatically or individually rotated during dis-
tillation. Choices from the pull-down menu include turning Off, rotating Collectively by 
File, and rotating Individually. When you select Collectively by File, Acrobat analyzes the 
text in the file and rotates pages based on the orientation of the majority of the text in the 
entire file. When you choose Individually, Acrobat rotates each page based on the major-
ity of text on a given page. Selecting Off results in no page rotation.
n Binding. This setting relates to viewing pages in an Acrobat viewer with Two-Up and 
Two-Up Continuous page layouts and with thumbnails when viewed aside each other. 
In addition, the binding can affect other items like the direction of scrolling text across 
the screen and certain animated effects you add. By default, the binding is left-sided.
n Resolution. Settings for Resolution affect only vector objects and type in EPS files. The 
settings range between 72 and 4000 dpi. A handy Tool Tip appears when you click in 
the field box that shows the upper and lower limits of acceptable values. Lower resolution 
settings may create banding with gradients when files are printed. In practicality, you’ll 
notice no visual difference if you change the resolution to the default of 600. Setting the 
resolution to 2400 adds less than 3K to your file size.
n All Pages/Pages From. You can choose to create a PDF within a specified range of pages 
from a PostScript file that has been printed to disk from a document containing many 
pages. If one page is having trouble converting to PDF, you can eliminate it from distilla-
tion by choosing a specified page range. The default, All Pages, distills all pages in the 
PostScript file.
n Embed thumbnails. Acrobat and Reader 9 no longer use embedded thumbnails even if 
they are present. This is a legacy feature for older viewers. There is never a good reason to 
embed thumbnails.

329
Using Acrobat Distiller
10
n Optimize for fast web view. An optimized PDF file may be smaller than one created 
without optimization. All files intended to be used for screen views, CD-ROM replication, 
and Web usage should all be optimized. Optimized files are primarily designed for byte-
serving on Web servers for page-at-a-time downloads. Generally, almost any printing 
device also accepts optimized files. As a default, keep this option On. Acrobat optimizes 
files by eliminating repeating elements and supplying pointers to where the first occur-
rence of an object is found in the file. Optimization also prepares files for page-at-a-time 
downloading from Web servers. If byte-serving capability exists on a server, the opti-
mized files download pages as they are viewed.
n Default Page Size. Setting page sizes in these field boxes only applies to distillation of 
EPS and PostScript files where page boundaries are not specified. Whatever you enter in 
the field boxes when distilling PostScript files is ignored if the page boundary is included 
in the file. If you want to trim a page size or create a larger page size for an EPS file, you 
can establish the dimensions in the field boxes for width and height. The Units pull-down 
menu enables you to choose from four different units of measure.
Images
Image settings are located under the second tab of the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 10.6.
 FIGURE 10.6
The second tab is Images.

330
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
Color images
The first category handles color images used in your original file. You have choices for the sam-
pling method and the amount of compression you want to apply. These include:
n Downsample. The Downsample pull-down menu offers choices for no sampling or three 
different sampling methods that include:
n Off. This turns off all compression for color images.
n Bicubic Downsampling to. A pull-down menu and two field boxes appear as your 
first choices in the Color Image section. Bicubic Downsampling is the default setting 
for all preset Adobe PDF settings. Bicubic downsampling uses a weighted average to 
determine the resampled pixel color. The algorithm is much more mathematically 
intensive and, as a result, this method takes the longest time to complete distillation 
when files are downsampled. The upside is it produces the best image quality for con-
tinuous tone images. With this method as well as the other two choices for resampling 
images there are two field boxes where the amount of sampling is user defined. The 
values range between 9 and 2400 ppi. The “for images above” field box enables you to 
choose when an image is resampled.
n Average Downsampling to. From the pull-down menu, the item following the Off 
selection is Average Downsampling to. When you resample an image by downsam-
pling, the average pixel value of a sample area is replaced with a pixel of the averaged 
color. The field boxes to the right of the sampling method are for user-determined 
sampling amounts, used in the same way as the preceding Bicubic method.
n Subsampling to. When Subsampling is specified, a pixel within the center of the sam-
ple area is chosen as the value applied to the sample area. Thus, downsampling noted 
previously, replaces pixels from averaged color values, whereas subsampling replaces 
pixels from a given color value. Of the two methods, subsampling significantly reduces 
the amount of time to resample the image. Because all that averaging is taking place 
with downsampling, the calculations are more extensive, thereby increasing the distil-
lation time. Subsampling, however, may result in more problems in the printed PDF 
file. Unless you have a large single-color background, you are better off choosing 
Bicubic downsampling when printing to hard copy.
n Compression. The pull-down menu enables you to select from Automatic (JPEG), JPEG, 
ZIP, or Off, depending on the compatibility setting you use. When you select Automatic, 
Distiller examines each image and automatically determines which compression to use 
(that is, either ZIP or JPEG). If an image has large amounts of a common color value, ZIP 
compression is used. If an image consists of smooth transitions of color, such as a contin-
uous tone photograph, JPEG compression is used. If you want to apply the same com-
pression to all images, you can select either the JPEG or ZIP options. Doing so eliminates 
any decision making by Distiller about the type of compression to be applied. When you 
select Off, no compression is applied. Although you may want to downsample images as 
noted earlier with one of the downsampling options, you may not want to apply com-
pression to the images.

331
Using Acrobat Distiller
10
n Image Quality. After you select the compression type, you have one of five choices (also 
depending on compatibility) for the amount of compression applied. Maximum relates to 
less compression, whereas Minimum relates to high compression. For high-end prepress, 
use the Maximum or High choice from the pull-down menu. For desktop color printers, 
use Medium quality; and for Web, screen, or CD-ROM replication, use Low quality. The 
Minimum setting might be used in some cases with screen or Web graphics, but continu-
ous tone photographs often appear visibly degraded. You might use this setting to trans-
fer files quickly across the Internet for client approvals and then later use a higher setting 
for the final production documents.
Grayscale
All the choices you have for color images are identical for grayscale images. You can use different 
settings for color and grayscale images by toggling through all the options. When the final PDF is 
produced, the sampling and compression for your images are respectively applied from choices 
made for each image type.
Monochrome images
Monochrome images include only two color values — black and white. Photoshop line art is a mono-
chrome image. This is not to be confused with line art as we define it with vector art applications. 
The sampling methods available to you for monochrome images are identical to those described 
for color images. Compression settings, however, are much different. In addition to Off for apply-
ing no compression, the options include the following:
n CCITT Group 3. The International Coordinating Committee for Telephony and Telegraphy 
(CCITT) Group 3 compression is used by fax machines. The images are compressed in 
horizontal rows, one row at a time.
n CCITT Group 4. CCITT Group 4 is a general-purpose compression method that pro-
duces good compression for most types of bitmap images. This compression method is 
the default and typically the best method for bitmap images.
n ZIP. ZIP compression is more efficient than earlier versions of Acrobat that used LZW 
compression. ZIP achieves approximately 20 percent more compression. It should be 
used when large areas of a single color appear in an image.
n Run Length. The Run Length format is a lossless compression scheme particularly favor-
able to bitmap monochrome images. You can run tests yourself for the compression 
method that works best for you. Typically, CCITT Group 4 handles most of your needs 
when compressing these images.
n Anti-Alias to gray. Bitmap images may appear pixelated onscreen or, in some cases, when 
printed. By using anti-aliasing, images are rendered with a smoother appearance. You can 
choose the amount of anti-aliasing from the pull-down menu. Choices are for 2, 4, and 8 
bits that produce 4, 16, and 256 levels of gray, respectively. If you use anti-aliasing with 
scanned type, small point sizes may appear blurry, especially with higher gray levels.

332

Part II
n Policy. Click the Policy button and the Adobe PDF – Image Policy dialog box opens as 
shown in Figure 10.7. The options in the dialog box enable you to control a job deter-
mined from decisions you make about image resolution. From the pull-down menus 
below each resolution item you can select from Ignore, Warn and Continue, and Cancel 
Job. If a given image is below a resolution value you add to one of the three field boxes 
for a given image type, you can instruct Acrobat to honor the choice(s) you make from 
the menu selections. Ignore is the default and no result occurs if images fall below a 
certain resolution. Warn and Continue opens a warning dialog box, informs you that 
Distiller found an image below the resolution you specify in one of the field boxes, and 
continues producing the PDF. Cancel Job stops all distillation if an image is found below 
the resolution setting(s).
 FIGURE 10.7
The Adobe PDF – Image Policy dialog box enables you to set options for a job determined on decisions 
you make for image resolution.
Guidelines for sampling images
Acrobat handles sampling appropriate for your output needs as long as the image sampling is equal 
to or greater than the requirements for the output. If image resolution is lower than the output 
needs, then Distiller isn’t able to upsample images to provide the necessary resolution. Even though 
Distiller can effectively downsample images, you should observe a few rules.
First, you should sample the resolution for all images in a layout or design at the highest output 
requirement. For example, if you intend to use prepress and commercial printing, the image sam-
ple needs a resolution to support commercial printing. In this regard, you want to sample images 
in Photoshop at the required resolution. Don’t rely on Distiller to downsample images during dis-
tillation for all your professional print jobs. The time you save can add up if you’re converting 
many files with high-resolution images. When you open the Adobe PDF settings and select the 
Images pane, select Off for the sampling items.
You use the second rule when repurposing images. If you have a PostScript file that has been 
printed for a higher order of output, like the commercial printing discussed earlier in this chapter, 

333
Using Acrobat Distiller
10
then you don’t need to create a second PostScript file for another output destination. Use the same 
PostScript file and select the sampling options appropriate for the output. Using this same exam-
ple, if you now want to create a PDF for screen views, select Bicubic Downsampling to and set the 
resolution to 72 dpi.
PDF WORKFLOW
PDF WORKFLOW The “Guidelines for sampling images” apply to workflows where you create 
PostScript files and can easily distill PostScript files using different Adobe PDF set-
tings. If you have a collection of PDF files that were prepared for a given output such as commer-
cial printing, and you want to repurpose the files for another output source such as Web hosting 
or screen viewing, use the PDF Optimizer in Acrobat Professional or Acrobat Pro Extended.
CROSS-REF

For more information on repurposing PDF files and using the PDF Optimizer, see 
Chapter 18.
Fonts
The distinctive advantage of using the Portable Document Format is that it maintains file integrity 
across computers and across platforms. One of the greatest problems with file integrity is the han-
dling of fonts. Fortunately, Distiller provides the ability to embed fonts within the PDF so the end 
user won’t need font installations to view and print PDF files. The Fonts pane, shown in Figure 10.8, 
offers options for setting font-embedding attributes during distillation.
 FIGURE 10.8
The Fonts item in the Adobe PDF settings displays the control over font embedding available to you during 
distillation.

334
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
Options in the Fonts pane include the following:
n Embed all fonts. Unless you have a specific reason not to embed fonts, this option should 
always be enabled for file exchanges and printing. You might choose not to embed fonts 
when you want to reduce files to the smallest possible size for Web hosting or if your 
documents will be exclusively in your organization and everyone has the fonts used.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Many different font developers exist, and the permissions for use of fonts from 
these developers vary considerably. To legally include font embedding in a PDF file, 
you need to know whether the developer provides the permission for font embedding. Adobe 
original fonts that are owned by Linotype-Hell, International Typeface Corporation, AGFA, 
AlphaOmega, Bigelow & Holmes, Fundicion Typografica Neufville, and Monotype Typography, 
Ltd., as well as those in the Adobe library, can be used for font embedding without written 
releases. Fonts with licensing restrictions often appear with an explanation of the limitations of 
use. If in doubt, you’ll need to check with the developer or distributor to inquire as to whether 
you can legally distribute PDF files that include certain fonts. Failure to do so may result in a 
copyright violation.
n Embed OpenType fonts. The box is active only when using Acrobat 7 or greater com-
patibility. This option is not recommended for normal workflows. If you have a special 
need to embed the entire OpenType font, check this box.
n Subset embedded fonts when percent of characters used is less than [ ]. Some PDF 
producers provide you an opportunity to subset PostScript, OpenType, and TrueType 
fonts. The difference between the subsetting in Distiller as opposed to other producers is 
your ability to determine when a font is subset. With Distiller, you can specify when you 
want subsetting to occur. The subsetting percentage has to do with the percentage of 
glyphs (special renderings) in the font. If 100% is selected, Distiller always subsets the 
embedded font. Lower percentages determine what characters among the set are embed-
ded. Type 3, TrueType, and CID fonts are always embedded and subsetted regardless of 
what value is supplied. (For font format descriptions, see Table 10.1 later in this chapter.)
 
When two or more PostScript files are converted to PDF with Acrobat Distiller using font 
subsetting, Distiller gives the resulting PDF only one font subset. The result is a more effi-
cient PDF document and produces smaller file sizes, especially when combining several 
PostScript files to produce a single PDF.
n When embedding fails. This pull-down menu offers three choices. Choose Ignore to 
ignore a failed font being embedded, in which case distillation continues. The Warn and 
Continue option displays a warning and then continues distillation. Choose Cancel to 
cancel the distillation if a font embedding error occurs. When sending files off to service 
centers for imaging or when font substitution is not desired, use this latter option as your 
default. If the PDF is not produced, you won’t inadvertently forget there was a problem 
with font embedding.
n Embedding. The left side of the dialog box lists all fonts available for embedding. From 
the pull-down menu, you select from the different folders Distiller monitors for fonts. 
Distiller can monitor font locations on your computer. If you want to view the font list 
from another monitored folder, click the pull-down menu and select the folder. 

335
Using Acrobat Distiller

Regardless of what is listed in the Embedding list, Distiller can also embed fonts that were 
included in the PostScript file or all the folders listed for monitoring. The fonts to be 
embedded must be present in either the PostScript file or a monitored folder.
NOTE
NOTE
Fonts that have license restrictions are shown in the Font Source list with a padlock 
icon. If you select the font, the restriction attributes are displayed in the Fonts pane. 
You cannot move locked fonts to the Always Embed list.
n Always Embed. A list of fonts for always embedding appears to the right of the Embedding 
list. You add fonts to this list by selecting them from the Embedding list and clicking the 
right-pointing chevron (double arrows). You can select multiple fonts by pressing the 
Ctrl (Windows) key or Ô (Macintosh) key and clicking all the fonts to be included. If the 
fonts are listed in a contiguous display, press Shift+click. After selecting the font(s), click 
the right-pointing chevron. A good use for the Always Embed list might be for a font that 
appears in your company logo. Regardless of the type of document you create, you may 
want to always include your corporate font set in all your documents to avoid any font 
substitution.
NOTE
NOTE
The design of TrueType and OpenType fonts enables the type designer the ability to 
prevent font embedding. These fonts can be moved to the Always Embed list, but if 
they are designed without embedding permissions, they fail to embed in PDFs. Font embedding 
errors are reported in the log file, which you can view in a text editor. If a PDF is produced, you 
can choose File ➪  Properties ➪ Fonts to determine whether the font was embedded.
n Never Embed. This list operates the same way as the Always Embed list. You select fonts 
to be eliminated from the set of monitored fonts or fonts contained in a PostScript file. One 
use for this list might be to eliminate Courier, Times, Helvetica, and Symbol (the Base 14 
fonts). Because they are usually burned into ROM chips on most PostScript devices, you 
rarely have a problem either viewing them or printing documents containing these fonts.
n Add Name. You can add fonts to the Always Embed list or the Never Embed list by 
entering the font name in a separate dialog box. To add a font name, you must type the 
name in the dialog box precisely as the font is identified. When you click the Add Name 
button in the Fonts pane, the Add Font Name dialog box opens where you enter the 
name in the field box. Two radio buttons exist for determining where the font is added. 
Select either the Always Embed list or Never Embed list as needed. Click Done, and the 
font appears in the appropriate list.
n Remove. If you add a font name to either the Always Embed list or the Never Embed list, 
and you want to delete that name, select the font name to be deleted and click Remove. 
You can’t remove fonts from the Embedding list. The only time Remove is enabled is when 
you select a font name in either the Always Embed list or Never Embed list.
NOTE
NOTE
The priority used by Distiller to decide whether to embed a font in the PDF follows 
an order to resolve ambiguity. The Never Embed list is viewed by Distiller as having 
the highest order of priority. If you place a font in the Never Embed list, it is not embedded even 
though you may add the same font to the Always Embed list.

Font types
Any PDF author will tell you the continuing problem with file displays and printing, as well as 
producing PDFs, relates to font handling. People swear at times that they have enabled all the 
appropriate controls for font embedding and PDF file creation, yet the resulting PDF either dis-
plays or prints with font substitution. Gathering as much knowledge as you can with regard to font 
evolution, design, engineering, and proper use helps you understand how to overcome problems 
and provide solutions for your workflow. To gain a little more understanding, look at the font 
types, formats, and their characteristics:
n Type 0. Type 0 (zero) is a high-level composite font format that references multiple font 
descendents. Type 0 fonts use an OCF (Original Composite Font) format that was Adobe’s 
first effort in attempting to implement a format for handling fonts with large character 
sets. A good example of a font using a large character set is Asian Language font types. 
Today, the OCF format is not supported.
n Type 1. Type 1 fonts used to be the most popular PostScript font; however, today the 
OpenType fonts have surpassed Type 1 in popularity. Type 1 fonts are single-byte fonts 
handled well by font managers and all PostScript printers. Type 1 fonts use a specialized 
subset of the PostScript language, which is optimized for performance.
NOTE
NOTE
The one problem with Type 1 fonts is there isn’t a means for flagging the font for 
don’t embed. As a result, the end user can’t determine font permissions for embed-
ding Type 1 fonts. As of this writing Adobe has converted all its Type 1 fonts to OpenType fonts. 
OpenType fonts always have an extra bit to determine embedding rights. For more information 
on OpenType fonts, see “OpenType Font Format” later in this section.
n Type 2. Type 2 fonts offer compact character description procedures for outline fonts. 
They were designed to be used with the Compact Font Format (CFF). The CFF format is 
designed for font embedding and substitution with Acrobat PDFs.
n Type 3. Type 3 fonts are special fonts that only exist in PostScript and PDF — you will 
never see them installed on your Mac or Windows computer. They were used in the early 
days of PostScript for the transition of bitmapped fonts to outline fonts and are rarely 
seen in modern typesetting solutions.
n OpenType Font Format. OpenType is a joint effort by Adobe Systems, Apple Computer, 
and Microsoft to provide a new generation of type font technology. OpenType makes no 
distinction between Type 1 and TrueType fonts. It acts as a container for both Type 1 and 
TrueType. OpenType doesn’t care whether the font is Type 1 or TrueType; it uses the 
font inside the OpenType container accordingly. Font developers have a much easier way 
of porting font designs to a single format in production and mastering as well as across 
platforms. The OpenType format is supported with font embedding and distillation. Fonts 
eventually produced with this technology are as reliable as you find with Type 1 and 
TrueType fonts. In addition, OpenType offers a means for flagging the fonts for embed-
ding permissions.

337

n Compact Font Format. CFF is similar to the Type 1 format but offers much more com-
pact encoding and optimization. It was designed to support Type 2 fonts but can be used 
with other types. CFF can be embedded in PDFs with the PDF version 1.2 format and 
Acrobat 3.0 compatibility. Fonts supporting this format are converted by Distiller during 
distillation to CFF/Type 2 fonts and embedded in the PDF.
n CID-keyed Fonts. This format was developed to take advantage of large character sets, 
particularly the Asian CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) fonts. The format is an exten-
sion of the Type 1 format and supports ATM and PostScript printing. Kerning and spacing 
for these character sets are better handled in the OpenType format.
When distilling PostScript with Acrobat Distiller, font embedding and substitution are allowed as 
described in Table 10.1.

Color
Adobe has been working on developing standard color viewing and file tagging for color spaces for 
some time. Releases of the latest software products continue to support sophisticated color-handling 
methods. Latest releases of products such as Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop have color 
control options consistent with the new color-handling features initially introduced in Acrobat 5. 
When making choices for color handling, your first decision is whether to convert color. After your 
conversion choice, you move on to working spaces and profile assumptions. If you tag a file for con-
version, what profiles do you want to embed in the document? Under the Color Management Policies 
settings, you choose control for many conditions for prepress operations as well as onscreen viewing. 
As you view the Color pane in the Adobe PDF settings, examine each of the controls available for 
color handling, as shown in Figure 10.9.
TIP
TIP
A thorough coverage of color management is a complex subject and beyond the 
scope of this book. If you are confused about many issues discussed in this chapter 
or you want to work on developing a color-managed workflow, open any Acrobat viewer. Select 
the Search tool and click Search PDFs on the Internet. Add color management for the search 
criteria and select Match Exact word or phrase from the pull-down menu. Click the Search the 
Internet button. Many PDF documents are available on the Internet that define color management 
and discuss how to set up color-managed workflows. You can build a library of articles and essays 
on the subject and keep them readily available on your local computer.

 FIGURE 10.9
Manage color profiles in the Color pane.
Adobe Color settings
Working with a color management system requires you to make some decisions about how the 
color is viewed on your computer monitor and on the final output medium. In some cases the 
monitor view and output medium view are the same, such as Acrobat viewer files onscreen and 
Web files. You make the first of your color decisions from among the choices in the pull-down 
menu for Settings File.
When you select None from the pull-down menu, you can custom edit the Color Management 
Policies and Working Spaces choices. If you choose an option other than None, the Color 
Management Policies and Working Spaces options are grayed out. Other choices for settings 
include prepress defaults, Photoshop emulation, defaults for Web graphics, and turning off color 
management. When color management and profile embedding is controlled by other programs 
such as Photoshop, leave the setting to None and turn off all color management for the choices 
discussed next.

339
Using Acrobat Distiller

Color Management Policies
If you select None from the Settings pull-down menu, the options for Color Management Policies 
and Intent are active. If you make any other choice from the menu, these items are grayed out. 
Choices for the Color Management Policies are different depending on what compatibility choice 
you select in the General pane of the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box. Acrobat 4.0 compatibility 
offers different options than the 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0 compatibilities. As you look at the following 
policy choices, keep in mind that the settings change according to the compatibility selection you 
made:
n Leave Color Unchanged. Enable this menu item if you presume all color handling in the 
PostScript file is defined for your specific needs. No color conversion occurs and device-
independent colors remain unchanged. When you send files to color-calibrated devices, 
you should use this option. The presumption is the device specifies all color handling 
and the file is not to be tagged for color management.
n Tag Everything for Color Management. When you choose Acrobat 4.0 compatibility or 
above, a color profile selected in the Working Spaces section is used to Tag Everything 
for Color Management, which embeds an ICC profile for the images, artwork, and text. 
The printed (and viewed) PDF file maintains the integrity of any documents containing 
embedded profiles.
n Tag Only Images for Color Management. The same holds true as noted in the preced-
ing entry except only raster images are tagged for color management according to the 
same compatibility options selected in the General pane. Text and vector objects remain 
unaffected.
n Convert All Colors to sRGB. Selecting this option converts all colors to sRGB. Converting 
colors to sRGB is best used for screen and Web images. The file sizes are smaller and 
screen redraws appear faster. Grayscale images are unaffected by choices made for color 
tagging and conversion.
n Convert All Colors to CMYK. This option provides RGB and spot color conversion to 
CMYK. If your job is to be printed as process color, select this menu item.
Below the Color Management Policies pull-down menu is the Document Rendering Intent pull-
down menu, which you use for the Intent for how color will be mapped between color spaces. 
Choices for Intent include the following:
n Preserve. The first of the Intent choices is Preserve. Preserve involves no color compensation.
n Perceptual. Perceptual (Images) has to do with the mapping of pixels from one gamut to 
another. When you select this item, the image is mapped from the original pixels to the 
color gamut of the printer profile. All the out-of-gamut colors are remapped.

340
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
n Saturation. Saturation (Graphics) maintains relative saturation values. If a pixel is satu-
rated and out of the color gamut of the printer, it is remapped preserving saturation but 
mapped to the closest color within the printer’s gamut.
n Absolute Colormetric. This disables the white point matching when colors are con-
verted. With no white point reference, you will notice a change in brightness values of all 
the remapped colors.
n Relative Colormetric. This preserves all color values within the printer’s gamut. Out-of-
gamut colors are converted to the same lightness values of colors within the printable gamut.
Working Spaces
Profile management for working spaces involves your decisions for embedding profiles for the color 
space while viewing your images onscreen. If a color space is defined for a given image and viewed 
on one monitor, theoretically it can be viewed the same on other monitors if the color profile is 
embedded in the image. Either of the two tagging options, Tag Everything for Color Management 
or Tag Only Images for Color Management, must be selected in order for a working space to be 
defined:
n Gray. Selecting None from this menu prevents grayscale images from being converted. The 
Dot Gain choices affect the overall brightness of grayscale images. Lower values lighten 
the image whereas values above 20 percent display grayscale images darker. Gray Gamma 
choices might be used for images viewed between computer platforms. A Gray Gamma 
of 1.8 is suited for Macintosh viewing whereas the higher 2.2 Gamma is better suited for 
Windows.
n RGB. If you use a color calibration system or monitor profile, you can select the respective 
profile from this pull-down menu. Choices available to you depend on profiles installed 
on your computer. If you have created custom profiles from Adobe Photoshop and saved 
them, they are listed as menu options. Default RGB profiles from Photoshop appear here 
after Photoshop is installed on your computer. The default option is sRGB IEC61966-2.1. 
If in doubt, use this option. It is becoming an industry standard and generally good for 
matching color between display and color output devices.
n CMYK. CMYK profiles also appear according to those stored in the respective folder 
according to platform as mentioned in the preceding bullet. Profile tagging is uniquely 
applied to images according to the color mode of the image. Thus, the Gray options 
apply only to grayscale images. RGB choices are applied to only RGB images whereas the 
CMYK choices tag only CMYK images. When using CMYK output for prepress you may 
have a profile embedded in the CMYK images. You can select None for this setting while 
changing the Gray and RGB working spaces, which preserves the color for output, enabling 

341
Using Acrobat Distiller
10
you to tag the other color modes for screen views. It would be unlikely that you would 
use RGB and CMYK images together for prepress, but you could set up the Adobe PDF 
settings for consistent display of files regardless of the color mode used.
CMYK color spaces
A single check box — Preserve CMYK values for calibrated CMYK color spaces — appears for this 
item. Unless you select Convert All Colors to CMYK in the Color Management Policies, the item is 
grayed out. Check the box when it’s active and the CMYK color space is preserved when profile 
embedding has been applied.
Device-Dependent Data
All options available under the Device Dependent Data section are applied to images intended for 
prepress and printing. Whatever choices you make here have no effect on screen views:
n Preserve under color removal and black generation. If you made changes to undercolor 
removal or black generation settings in Photoshop, these changes are preserved when the 
file is distilled. Disabling the check box eliminates any settings made in Photoshop.
n When transfer functions are found. If you embed transfer functions in Adobe Photoshop, 
you can preserve them by selecting Apply from the pull-down menu. If transfer functions 
have not been saved with your Photoshop file, it won’t matter if Apply is used. Use Apply 
when you intentionally set them up in a Photoshop image and you have the settings con-
firmed by your printer. If you select Preserve, the transfer functions are preserved without 
applying them. You can eliminate transfer functions set in a file by selecting Remove from 
the pull-down menu. As a matter of default, if you don’t use transfer functions or know 
what they are, select Remove from the pull-down menu. If you inadvertently save a 
Photoshop file as EPS and embed transfer functions, they are removed when the file gets 
distilled.
n Preserve halftone information. Preserving the halftone information does not disturb 
halftone frequencies embedded in documents, as well as custom angles, spot shapes, and 
functions specified. Depending on the service center you use, they may want to have you 
set halftone information in the PostScript file and preserve it in the PDF. For PostScript 3 
devices, PDFs can be sent straight to the imagesetter and printed at the halftone frequency 
preserved in the file. Service centers using PostScript Level 2 RIPs won’t care if the half-
tone frequency is preserved or not. They’ll have to manually print the PDFs using the 
Print and Advanced Print Setup dialog boxes.
Advanced
Advanced settings contain a variety of options for job ticketing, document structure, and other 
items not found in the previous panes, as shown in Figure 10.10.

342
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
 FIGURE 10.10
The Advanced Adobe PDF Settings dialog box offers a group of miscellaneous settings often not available 
with other PDF producers.
These options include:
n Allow PostScript file to override Adobe PDF settings. If you are certain the PostScript 
file you printed to disk has all the settings handled properly for output, enabling this option 
allows the PostScript file to supersede any changes you make in Adobe PDF settings. 
Disabling the check box allows all Options specifications settings to take precedence.
n Allow PostScript XObjects. A PostScript XObject stores common information in a 
document, such as backgrounds, headers, footers, and so on. When PostScript XObjects 
are used, printing is faster, but requires more memory. If you disable the check box, 
XObjects won’t be used and the memory burden is reduced.
n Convert gradients to smooth shades. Gradients are converted to smooth shades and 
appear much smoother when rendered on PostScript 3 devices. The appearance of the 
gradients is improved when viewed onscreen and has noticeable differences when print-
ing some files with more gray levels.
n Convert smooth lines to curves. Checking this box helps reduce file sizes significantly 
when creating PDFs from CAD drawing programs. Checking the box reduces the amount 
of control points used to build curves in CAD programs, resulting in much smaller file 
sizes and much faster displays on your monitor. You can experience similar results on 
files where the Auto Trace tool was used in Adobe Illustrator.

343
Using Acrobat Distiller

n Preserve Level 2 copypage semantics. This setting has to do with semantic differences 
between PostScript Level 2 and PostScript 3. If you are imaging to PostScript Level 2 
devices, enable this option. If you’re printing to PostScript 3 devices, disable this option. 
If you are sending files to an imaging center, ask the technicians which level of PostScript 
is used on their devices.
n Preserve overprint settings. Overprints manually applied in applications, such as illus-
tration and layout programs, are preserved when you enable this option. Overprinting 
has an effect only when your files are color separated or possibly when you print com-
posite color to proofing machines that display trapping problems from files printed as 
separations. If your workflow is consistent and you don’t deviate between creating over-
prints and relying on a service center to perform them, you could leave this item as a 
default for your high-end output needs. Enabling the check box has no effect on images 
where overprints are not present.
n Overprinting default is nonzero overprinting. When enabled, this option prevents 
objects with no color values specified as CMYK from knocking out other CMYK colors.
n Save Adobe PDF settings inside PDF file. This option embeds the Adobe PDF settings 
used to produce the PDF inside the PDF document as a file attachment. Print shops can 
review the settings to diagnose problems that may have been produced during distillation. 
Open the Attachments pane to see the embedded file.
n Save original JPEG images in PDF if possible. Distiller decompresses JPEG files during 
distillation. If you select this option, the decompressed JPEG files are not recompressed 
by Distiller.
n Save Portable Job Ticket inside PDF file. Job tickets contain information about the orig-
inal PostScript file and not the content of the PDF file. Information related to page sizes, 
page orientation, resolution, halftone frequencies, trapping information, and so on, is 
some of what is contained in job tickets.
n Use Prologue.ps and Epilogue.ps. There are two files, named prologue.ps and epilogue.
ps, available on the Acrobat Pro/Pro Extended 9 CD-ROM installer.
 
In order to use the files, you must move them to the same folder as the Acrobat Distiller 
application, and both files must reside together in this location. The files contain PostScript 
code appended to a PDF file when it is created with Distiller. By default the files do not 
contain any data that affect distillation. They serve more as templates where you can write 
code to append data to the PDF. You use the prologue.ps file to append information to 
the PDF such as a note, cover page, or job ticket information. You use the epilogue.ps file 
to resolve PostScript procedure problems.
NOTE
NOTE
You can edit both of these files; however, you need to be familiar with the PostScript 
language to effectively change the files. When relocating the files, be certain to 
place a copy in the Distiller folder and leave the original in the Data folder, especially if you decide 
to edit either file. You can also use the files with watched folders, as explained a little later in this 
chapter. When using watched folders, place the prologue.ps and epilogue.ps files at the same 
directory level as the In and Out folders.

344

Part II
n Process DSC comments. Document structuring comments (DSC) contain information 
about EPS files. Items such as originating application, creation date, modification date, 
page orientation, and so on, are all document-structuring comments. To maintain the 
DSC, enable this option. Because some important information such as page orientation 
and beginning and ending statements for the prologue.ps file are part of the document 
structure, you’ll want to keep this item enabled as a default.
n Log DSC warnings. During distillation, if the processing of the document-structuring 
comments encounters an error, the error is noted in a log file. When you enable this 
check box, a log file is created. You can open the log file in a word processor or text 
editor to determine where the error occurred. Enable this option whenever document-
structuring comments are processed.
n Preserve EPS information from DSC. This item is similar to the Process DSC comments 
option. If your file is an EPS file, enabling this check box preserves document-structuring 
comments.
n Preserve OPI comments. Open PrePress Interface (OPI) is a management tool used by 
many high-end imaging centers to control production. An OPI comment might include 
the replacement of high-resolution images for low-resolution FPO (for position only) files 
used in a layout program. OPI comments can include many different issues related to 
digital prepress such as image position on a page, crop area, sampling resolution, color 
bit depth, colors (in other words, CMYK, spot, and so on), overprint instructions, and 
more. If you’re outputting to high-end imaging devices at service centers using OPI man-
agement, enable this option.
n Preserve document information from DSC. Document information items, discussed 
later in this book, include such things as title, subject, author, and keywords. Enabling 
this option preserves document information.
n Resize page and center artwork for EPS files. In earlier versions of Acrobat, distillation 
of a single-page EPS file, created from programs such as Adobe Illustrator, Macromedia 
FreeHand, or CorelDraw, used the EPS bounding box for the final page size. Many prob-
lems occurred when distilling EPS files directly as opposed to printed PostScript files. At 
times, a user would experience clipping and lose part of an image. With this option you 
have a choice between creating a PDF with the page dimensions equal to the artwork and 
having the artwork appear on the size of the original page you defined in your host appli-
cation. When the check box is enabled, the page size is reduced to the size of the artwork, 
and the artwork is centered on the page. When the check box is disabled, the entire page 
appears consistent with the page size used in the host application.
Standards (Acrobat Pro/Pro Extended only)
The Standards pane provides options for creating subsets of the PDF file in the form of PDF/X and 
PDF/A documents designed for printing and archiving, respectively. Click the Standards folder and 
select a Compliance Standard from the pull-down menu options. Although there are several options 
from which to choose, the categories are centered on PDF/X and PDF/A.

345
Using Acrobat Distiller
10
PDF/X
As explained earlier, PDF/X is a subset of the PDF format developed by an ISO (International 
Organization for Standardization) standards committee outside Adobe Systems. Adobe is a partici-
pant on the committee and supports the development and advances in PDF/X standards.
PDF/X has gained much acceptance among commercial printing companies for the purposes of 
creating files suitable for printing. PDF is a reliable format for any kind of electronic file exchanges. 
However, files developed for viewing in Acrobat viewers, Acrobat PDF forms, Web-hosted docu-
ments, and so on, carry a lot of overhead not necessary for printing on commercial printing devices. 
The PDF/X compliance standard was developed to streamline documents by eliminating unnecessary 
data and optimizing files for print. The process of tailoring a PDF document for print by creating a 
PDF/X-compliant file does not necessarily reduce file size. In many cases, file sizes may grow from 
a standard PDF to a PDF/X file.
The PDF/X options available to you in Acrobat Distiller produce either a PDF/X-1a:2002, PDF/
X-1a:2003, PDF/X-1a:2003, or PDF/X-3 compliant file. These file types are different versions of 
the PDF/X format. PDF/X-1a is designed to work well with both process and spot color, but no 
support is provided for color management or profile embedding. PDF/X-3 supports process and 
spot color and also supports color-managed workflows and ICC (International Color Consortium) 
profile embedding.
NOTE
NOTE
The PDF/X pane appears only in Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended and is not 
available to Acrobat Standard users.
When you use PDF/X during distillation you are checking the file for PDF/X compliance. If the 
file does not meet the PDF/X standard you select (that is, PDF/X-1a or PDF/X-3), you can halt the 
distillation process much like halting distillation when fonts don’t embed properly. If a file meets 
PDF/X compliance, you have much greater assurance that your PDF document will print on almost 
any kind of commercial printing device.
You create PDF/X-compliant files with Acrobat Distiller or an authoring program that specifically 
addresses PDF/X compliance when exporting to PDF. InDesign is one application that supports 
PDF creation with delivery of a PDF/X-compliant file. Other PDF producers such as PDFMaker 
used with Microsoft Office applications can also create PDF/X-compliant files.
The options you have in the Standards pane in Acrobat Pro, shown in Figure 10.11, include the 
following:
n Compliance Standard. The pull-down menu contains options for all the PDF/X compli-
ance versions, a setting for PDF/A compliance, and an option for None.
n When not compliant. Two menu choices are available from this pull-down menu. Select 
Continue to create the PDF file if the file does not meet PDF/X compliance. The PDF file 
is created and a log file is generated reporting problems. If you select Cancel Job, the PDF 
is not created and assures you of only producing files that meet the PDF/X standards.
n Report as error. Enabling this radio button reports the file noncompliant if a trim box or 
media box is missing on any page in the document.

346
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
n Set TrimBox to MediaBox with offset (Inches). When the radio button is enabled, the 
trim box is calculated against the media box for offset distances if neither is specified in 
the PostScript file. The trim box is always equal to or smaller than the media box. Edit 
the field boxes for determining the offset amounts that are analyzed.
n Set BleedBox to MediaBox. Uses the media box values for the bleed box if no bleeds are 
specified in the PostScript file. In many layout authoring programs, you have options for 
specifying bleed areas. If no bleeds are defined in the print dialog boxes, the media box 
values are used.
n Set BleedBox to TrimBox with offsets (Inches). If the bleed box is not defined, the 
values specified in the field boxes are computed against the trim box.
n Output Intent Profile Name. If the file does not specify an output intent, such as SWOP 
for example, Distiller uses the intent you select from the pull-down menu. The field box 
is editable and you can type an output intent in the field box. When the file is distilled 
and no intent was used when the PostScript file was printed, selecting None forces the 
job to fail compliance.
n Output Condition Identifier. This item is a reference name specified by the Output Intent 
Profile Name’s registry. The name is automatically supplied for known Output Intent Profile 
Names. If a conditional identifier is used, then the parameter must be manually added.
n Output Condition. This field box is where you supply the intended output condition. The 
field value is not assessed for compliance. It is used by the service center for information 
purposes. If you leave the field blank, it has no effect on whether the job meets compliance.
n Registry Name (URL). This item is also informational. For certain profiles selected in 
the Output Intent Profile Name pull-down menu, you’ll see a URL where more informa-
tion is hosted on a Web site related to the profile.
n Trapped. Three options are available from the pull-down menu. PDF/X compliance 
requires that the trapped state be either True or False. If you select Undefined it does 
not specify a trapping state the file fails PDF/X compliance. Insert True sets True as the 
trapped state. Insert False sets the state to no trapping.
n Help. The five icons to the right of the items in the Default Values if Not Specified in 
the Document area of the PDF/X pane offer help information. Click one of the icons and 
a pop-up menu opens with a definition for the respective option. In addition the Help 
button at the bottom of the dialog box opens the Complete Help document to the page 
where PDF/X information is found.
n Save As. The Save As button captures all the settings you make for the Adobe PDF set-
tings and opens a dialog box that defaults to the Settings folder. If you change any item 
in one of the preset options and click OK in the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box, the Save 
As dialog box opens automatically to prompt you to save the new settings to a new file. 
Provide a filename and click the Save button to create a new settings file.

PDF/A
Adobe Systems has been working with international standards committees toward a goal of ensur-
ing you that the documents of today can be electronically read 10, 20, even 100 years from now. 
One of the fruitions of these labors is the PDF/A-1b ISO standard developed for archiving purposes.
PDF/A files contain essentials in terms of document structure. The necessary essentials include 
raster images, fonts (embedded), and vector objects. Code used in documents such as JavaScript 
is deemed a nonessential ingredient as well as any form of security. Therefore, you cannot create 
PDF/A files containing any scripts or encryption. In general, you’ll find PDF/A files are much leaner 
than other file standards such as PDF/X.
To select PDF/A-1b from the Compliance Standard pull-down menu you need to select Acrobat 5 
or earlier compatibility in the General pane. When you select PDF/A-1b from the Compliance 
Standard pull-down menu the options in the PDF/A-1b pane appear as shown in Figure 10.12.

Select Acrobat 5 or earlier compatibility and select PDF/A-1b from the Compliance Standard pull-down 
menu.
The few options you have include the same options for file handling when a file is not compliant as 
you have with PDF/X files. Under the Output Intent Profile Name pull-down menu are options for 
choosing the output intent like you see available in the Color pane. The Output Condition is a 
field box for user-supplied data.
Managing Adobe PDF settings
You can manage Adobe PDF settings via commands in the Settings menu, as shown in Figure 10.13. 
From the same Settings menu in Distiller (Windows) or top-level menu bar (Macintosh), click 
Settings to open the Settings menu.
 FIGURE 10.13
Adobe PDF settings are managed using commands in the Settings menu.
The Add Adobe PDF Settings dialog box opens where you can load a settings file created by other 
users in your workflow or a settings file sent to you by a service provider. You can load settings 
files from any folder on your computer. When you add the file using the Add Adobe PDF Settings 
dialog box, the file is moved to a folder where Distiller retrieves the settings and lists them in the 
Default Settings pull-down menu.

349
Using Acrobat Distiller

Choose Settings ➪ Remove Adobe PDF Settings to open the Remove Adobe PDF Settings dialog 
box. The only settings you see displayed in the dialog box are custom settings files you added after 
your Acrobat installation. Select a file to remove and click Remove. When you click Remove, the 
file is discarded and doesn’t appear in the Default Settings list in the Distiller window.
All additions and deletions for settings files can be accomplished through the menu commands. If 
you want to locate the folder where the settings files are located, look in C:\Program Files\Adobe\
Acrobat 9.0\Acrobat \Settings folder (Windows) or Library\Application Support\Adobe PDF \
Settings folder (Macintosh).
Identifying Font Locations
Font embedding occurs when Adobe PDF settings are enabled for font embedding and a font is con-
tained in the PostScript file or loaded in the system with a font utility or the system folder where 
fonts are accessed. If fonts reside neither in the PostScript file nor are loaded in your system, Distiller 
offers another method for locating fonts. Choose Settings ➪ Font Locations. The Acrobat Distiller – 
Font Locations dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10.14.
In this dialog box, you add folders of fonts that Distiller looks in when a font is neither contained 
in the PostScript file nor loaded in the system memory. Monitored font folders are listed in the 
window shown in Figure 10.14. To add a new folder, click the Add button. To remove a folder, 
select it in the list and click the Remove button.
A check box at the bottom of the dialog box enables you to resolve some problems that may occur 
when a TrueType font has the same name as a PostScript font. To eliminate embedding TrueType 
fonts with the same names as PostScript fonts, check the box at the bottom of the dialog box.
 FIGURE 10.14
Distiller monitors fonts installed on your hard drive when the fonts appear in a list in the Acrobat Distiller – 
Font Locations dialog box.

Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
Using Watched Folders
Watched folders enable you to automate distillation of PostScript files in a business or production 
environment. When Distiller encounters a new PostScript file, the file is distilled in the background 
while foreground applications are running. The resulting PDF files are automatically moved to 
another folder or directory, and the PostScript files are either preserved or deleted automatically.
Licensing restrictions
Before moving on to working with watched folders, please look over this section carefully and try 
to understand the proper use and authorization of working with watched folders on networks. 
Adobe Systems grants you license for working on a single computer when installing Acrobat. When 
you create PDFs on your computer you can distribute them to anyone who uses an Acrobat viewer. 
Therefore, the PDFs you create can legitimately be distributed to anyone who acquires the free 
Adobe Reader software.
Creating PDFs, whether locally or on a network, assumes you have complied with the proper 
licensing agreements for use of the Acrobat Distiller application. Ambiguity arises when using the 
Distiller application on networks with watched folders. If you set up a watched folder on a network 
where multiple users access the watched folders, you need a site license to use the Acrobat Distiller 
application, you need to have a licensed copy of Acrobat Standard or Pro/Pro Extended for each user, 
or you can purchase Adobe LiveCycle PDF Generator. Because Distiller is used by multiple users in 
this example, site licensing or individual purchases of the product is required.
Therefore, the licensing policies in this regard are related not to distribution, but rather, how the 
PDFs are created. As I move through the discussion on watched folders, keep in mind that when 
I make mention of using watched folders on networks, I’m assuming you are compliant with the 
proper licensing agreements.
Creating watched folders (Acrobat Pro/
Pro Extended only)
Watched folders can be individual folders, hard drive partitions, or dedicated hard drives. When 
you choose Settings ➪ Watched Folders, the Watched Folders dialog box opens, enabling you to 
establish preferences for the watched folders and distillation attributes.
The options available in the Watched Folders dialog box are as follows:
n Path. The list window displays all folders identified as watched folders. The name of the 
watched folder appears in the list as well as the directory path. In Figure 10.15, notice 
the directory path is shown.
n Check watched folders every [ ] seconds. This user-definable field accepts values 
between 1 and 9999 seconds. When Distiller monitors a watched folder, the folder is 
monitored according to the value entered in this field box.

351
Using Acrobat Distiller
10
 FIGURE 10.15
Watched folder preferences are established in the Acrobat Distiller – Watched Folders 
dialog box. When you open this dialog box, a reminder for the licensing restrictions 
appears at the bottom.
n PostScript file is. Distiller automatically treats the PostScript file according to the options 
available in this pull-down menu. You can select the Deleted menu item, which deletes 
the PostScript file after distillation, or select Moved to “Out” folder, which moves the 
PostScript file to a folder entitled Out. If you intend to repurpose files for different uses, 
be certain to keep the PostScript file.
n Delete output files older than [ ] days. If you elect to keep the PostScript files in the Out 
folder, they can be deleted after the time interval specified in this field box. The acceptable 
range is between 1 and 999 days.
n Add Folder. To create a watched folder or add to the current list of watched folders, click 
the Add Folder button. A navigation dialog box opens. To add a folder to the watched 
folders list, the folder must first be created before you click the Add Folder button. Once 
you add a folder, Distiller automatically creates an In and Out folder inside your selected 
folder. Folders as well as partitions and drives can be added to your list. On a network, 
remote folders, partitions, and drives can also be added to the list. If you want to select 
a folder, browse your hard drive and select the folder name after clicking the Add Folder 
button. If you want to have the entire hard drive watched, select the drive designation 
(C:\, D:\, E:\, and so on in Windows or Macintosh HD, Hard Drive, and so on with a 
Macintosh) and click OK in the Browse For Folder dialog box.

352
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
n Remove Folder. To delete watched folders, select the folder name in the watched folders 
list and click the Remove Folder button. If a folder is moved or deleted from your hard 
drive, the next time you launch Distiller, a warning dialog box opens notifying you that 
Distiller cannot find the watched folder(s). Removal of watched folders must occur in the 
Acrobat Distiller – Watched Folder dialog box. If you inadvertently deleted a watched 
folder on the desktop, you need to delete the folder name in the watched folders list. 
Return to your desktop and create a new folder; then return to the dialog box and add 
the new folder to the list.
n Edit Security. You can apply security to PDF files during distillation. Adding security 
during distillation is handy for multiple files created in PDF workflow environments. 
Security used on a watched folder is inherited from the Job Options settings. For example, 
if you select Acrobat 5.0 compatibility in the General pane, the security settings available 
to you here are compatible with 128-bit RSA. However, if you select Acrobat 7.0 and 
higher for your compatibility, the security is set to 128-bit AES.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on applying security to PDF documents, see Chapter 26.
n Clear Security. Select any one or all of the watched folders in the list and click Clear 
Security. The security is removed from the folders.
n Edit Settings. The Edit Settings button becomes active when you select a watched folder 
name in the watched folders list. With a folder name selected in the list, click the Edit 
Settings button to open the Adobe PDF Settings dialog box. You can apply different set-
tings to different watched folders. If, for example, you print PostScript files to disk and 
have them distilled for high-end output and Web page design, you will want compression 
and color modes distinctive for the output sources. You can set up two watched folders 
and have the same PostScript file distilled with the different settings. Editing settings here 
overrides Distiller’s defaults and applies new options to the specific watched folder where 
the attributes are established.
n Load Settings. All the settings contained in the Settings folder are available for loading 
and applying to watched folders listed in the window. Click Load Settings to open the 
Settings folder.
n Clear Settings. This option removes any settings applied to a watched folder. If you 
leave the watched folder listed with no specific settings assigned to the watched folder, 
the current default Adobe PDF settings are used.
PDF WORKFLOW
PDF WORKFLOW Watched folders greatly help your PDF workflow and assist you in automating the 
smallest office environment to large offices with multiple networks and servers. 
When you install a site-licensed copy of Acrobat Distiller on a server, the burden of PDF creation 
is dedicated to the server and relieves individual workstations.
In identifying watched folders, you need only have the directory or folder created on a hard drive. 
After you identify the watched folder, Distiller automatically creates the other folders needed to 
execute distillation from watched folder files. The In folder created by Distiller is monitored. When 
a PostScript file is placed or written to the In folder, the distillation commences according to the 

353
Using Acrobat Distiller
10
interval you establish in the Watched Folder settings dialog box. Files can be placed into the In 
folder, or you can print to PostScript directly to the In folder from within an application.
Watched folders work well in cross-platform environments, too. In order to use a watched folder 
from one platform and have the distillation performed on another platform, you need to have the 
computers networked and have software installed that enables you to communicate between two 
or more computers on your network.
Working with Non-Roman Text
Acrobat provides great support for text created from character sets foreign to U.S. English and 
other Roman text alphabets. Eastern languages such as Russian, Ukrainian, and similar languages 
based on forms of Cyrillic characters require proper configuration for font access and keyboard 
layouts. After configuring and using the fonts in a layout application, be certain to embed the fonts 
in the PostScript file or have Distiller monitor the font’s folder of the character set used. As is the 
case with any font embedded in the PDF, the document is displayed without font substitution. In 
Figure 10.16, I used a Cyrillic font in Microsoft Word. The file was printed to disk as PostScript 
and font embedding was used in Distiller’s Adobe PDF settings.
 FIGURE 10.16
When fonts are properly configured from character sets foreign to Roman characters, the fonts can be 
embedded and viewed without font substitution.
Eastern language support is provided by Acrobat but requires much more in regard to configuration 
and proper installation of the Asian Language Support option (Windows) or the Asian Language 
Kit (Macintosh). As long as the language support respective to your platform is installed with the 
Acrobat installer, files can be printed as PostScript and embedded in the PDFs. PDFs with embed-
ded Asian language options such as Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and Korean 
(CJK) are displayed without font substitution.
When installing Acrobat for use with these languages, you need to use the custom installation and 
include the language support with the other Acrobat components. After the support is installed, 

354
Converting Documents to PDF
Part II
font problems need to be resolved when you print to PostScript. PostScript fonts have fewer prob-
lems being embedded. TrueType fonts require special handling depending on the platform and 
type of fonts used. Special documentation for managing PostScript and TrueType fonts is included 
in the Acrobat documentation. For specific handling of Eastern Language support and TrueType 
fonts, review the documentation thoroughly before attempting to convert PostScript files to PDF.
Accessing Distiller
After all the controls have been established in the Adobe PDF settings dialog boxes, you’re ready to 
use the Distiller application. Files used with Distiller need to be PostScript files printed to disk or 
EPS files. You can access the Distiller application several ways:
n Open from Distiller. Find the Distiller application on your hard drive and double-click 
the application icon to launch Distiller. When the Distiller application window opens, 
choose File ➪ Open. Navigate to the file you want to convert to PDF and select it in the 
Acrobat Distiller – Open PostScript File dialog box. Select multiple files by using the Shift 
key to select a contiguous group of files or Ctrl/Ô to select a non-contiguous group. If the 
Preferences have been set up to ask for a filename or ask to replace a PDF, a navigation 
dialog box opens where you supply filename and destination.
n Drag and drop to the application icon. Either the application icon or a shortcut (alias in 
the Dock on Macintosh OS X) of the application can be used for drag-and-drop distillation. 
In this regard you can drag multiple PostScript files, EPS files, or a combination of both 
to either icon. Release the mouse button when the files are over the icon and Distiller 
launches and subsequently converts the file(s) to PDF.
n Drag to the application window. You can drag and drop a single file or multiple files on 
the Distiller application window. Launch Distiller to open the application window. Select 
a single file or multiple files and release the mouse button. All files are converted as indi-
vidual PDFs.
n Launch Distiller from within Acrobat. To open Distiller from within Acrobat choose 
Advanced ➪ Print Production ➪ Acrobat Distiller. The Distiller application launches and 
opens in the foreground in front of the Acrobat window. Choose File ➪ Open or use the 
drag-and-drop method to open the file.
n Print to Adobe PDF printer. From any authoring program, open the Print dialog box 
and select Adobe PDF. Execute the Print command and the file is distilled with the cur-
rent default Adobe PDF settings.
n Use the Run command (Windows). You can create PDFs with Distiller by accessing the 
Run command from the Windows status bar. Select Run and supply the directory path 
first for Distiller; then supply the path for the files to be converted. Syntax must be exact. 
Pathnames need to be contained within quotation marks and a space needs to separate 
the pathname for Distiller and the pathname for the file(s) to be converted. Filenames 
having spaces need to be contained within quotation marks. To distill multiple files enter 
the pathname and filename, and separate each file with commas. Inasmuch as Acrobat 
offers you this capability, you’ll often find drag-and-drop methods much easier.

355
Using Acrobat Distiller
10
n Exporting to PDF. From many application programs, such as Microsoft Office, and 
illustration and layout programs as discussed in Chapters 7 through 9, Distiller is used 
to produce PDFs. When distillation is complete, the user is returned to the application 
document window.
n Watched folders. As described earlier in this chapter, copying a PostScript or EPS file to 
the In folder inside a watched folder prompts distillation at the interval specified in the 
Acrobat Distiller – Watched Folders dialog box. Distiller must be launched before distilla-
tion of files from watched folders occurs.
When Distiller is used in all the preceding circumstances other than the use of watched folders, 
the current Adobe PDF settings selected in Distiller are used to produce the PDF. That is to say, 
if Distiller is launched and the Standard settings appear in the pull-down menu, the Standard set-
tings are used to create the PDF. When using watched folders, the settings associated with the 
watched folder are used to produce the PDF. If no settings are assigned to the watched folder, the 
current default settings are used.
Summary
n PostScript is a streamed language that can contain many different dialects and is often 
redundant in describing page elements for imaging. PDF is a much more efficient file 
format because it is structured like a database that offers logical order and eliminates 
redundancy.
n When creating PostScript files, the preferred PPD to use is the Acrobat Distiller PPD, or 
print to the Adobe PDF printer.
n Distiller preferences enable you to establish settings for filenaming and overwriting.
n Acrobat Distiller has many Adobe PDF settings enabling you to control font compression, 
image compression, color, high-end digital prepress output, PDF/X compliance, and 
PDF/A compliance. All Adobe PDF settings are available to Acrobat Standard users except 
PDF/X and PDF/A compliance.
n Additional font monitoring is established in the Distiller Settings menu for identifying 
different font locations on your computer.
n Watched folders enable you to create PDF workflows that automate the PDF creation 
process. Watched folders can be contained on local or remote storage systems in network 
environments. Use of watched folders with multiple-user access on a network requires 
strict compliance with Adobe’s licensing agreements.
n Acrobat enables you to supply security passwords at the time of distillation. Security 
levels are applied consistent with PDF compatibility.
n Eastern language character sets and Asian text are supported font-embedding features as 
long as font formats and font management are properly configured.
n Access to Acrobat Distiller is supported from within Acrobat 9.0, by using shortcuts or 
aliases, printer drivers, and through a variety of drag-and-drop procedures.


P
art III covers the many different editing opportunities 
you have available with Acrobat. Beginning in Chapter 11 
you find many ways to export PDF content for editing in 
original authoring programs. In Chapter 12 you find a wealth of 
information dedicated to combining documents and using the 
new Acrobat 9 PDF Portfolio features. Chapter 13 deals with 
text editing, followed by Chapter 14 where I cover redacting 
PDF files for those who need to remove sensitive information 
from PDFs. 
In Chapter 15 I talk about editing images and objects, and in 
Chapter 16 you find many ways for editing PDF pages in Acrobat. 
In Chapter 17 you find some of the new improvements for scan-
ning paper documents that ultimately are converted to PDF and 
the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) features you find in 
Acrobat. 
In Chapter 18 you’ll learn how to repurpose PDF files for screen 
viewing and Web hosting, as well as how to automate many tasks 
in Acrobat using batch sequences. This section on editing PDF 
files concludes with Chapter 19 where I talk about adding special 
features for Adobe Reader users for saving PDF forms and partici-
pating in comment reviews.

T
o begin this section on editing PDF documents I’ll start with saving 
files and exporting data. As you find in this chapter, Acrobat has Save 
tools and commands and supports exporting your PDF data in a vari-
ety of file formats. As you learned in Part II, files are not originally authored 
in Acrobat, but rather, they are converted to the PDF format. If you need to 
perform some major editing, it’s always best to try to return to the original 
authoring application, make your edits, and then convert to PDF. In some 
cases, however, you may not have an original authoring application docu-
ment. In such circumstances, you may need to get the PDF data in a format 
that you can manipulate and edit in another program. Fortunately, Acrobat 
supports exporting to many different file formats that can be imported in 
other programs.
Setting Up the Work Environment
The only tool used in this chapter is the Save tool, which appears in the 
default File toolbar. To return to default tools, open a context menu on the 
Toolbar Well and select Reset Toolbars or press Alt/Option+F8. The remain-
ing tools used with this chapter are derived from menu commands.
Saving PDF Files
When you open a PDF document in any viewer, the Save tool in the File 
toolbar and the File ➪ Save menu command are both grayed out. When you 
open the File menu and look at Save As, you notice the menu command is 
active.

Editing PDFs
Part III
 
 After you edit a file through the use of tools or menu commands, the Save tool and Save menu 
command become active.
You can use the File ➪ Save As command at any time. As you edit PDF documents, they tend to 
become bulky and contain unnecessary information. To optimize a file and make it the smallest 
file size, choose File ➪ Save As and select the default PDF format for the file type. If you save to 
the same folder location with the same filename, Acrobat rewrites the file as you use Save As. You 
should plan on using Save As and rewriting your file after your last edits. Doing so assures you of 
creating a smaller, more optimized file.
Another factor affecting optimized files is ensuring the default preferences are set to file optimiza-
tion when using the Save As command. Open the Preferences dialog box (Ctrl/Ô+K) and click 
Documents in the left pane. In the Documents preferences pane, be certain the check box is 
enabled for Save As optimizes for Fast Web View. Enabling this option ensures that your files are 
always optimized when you use Save As.
Exporting Data
By default, when you use either Save or Save As, the file type is a PDF document. Using Save offers 
you no other option for changing the file type; but when you select Save As, you can choose to 
export your PDF document in one of a number of different file formats. If you need to update a file 
or export data from PDF files, choose File ➪ Save As and choose a file format from the Save as type 
(Format on Macintosh) pull-down menu, as shown in Figure 11.1.
 FIGURE 11.1
Choose File ➪ Save As and choose the file format to be saved from the Save as type pull-down menu.

Users of Acrobat 8 may remember the Export Task button that provided a pull-down menu for 
choosing various export formats. The Export Task button has been removed from the Tasks tool-
bar and now appears as a menu command. Choose File ➪ Export, and from the Export submenu 
shown in Figure 11.2 you can choose a number of different export formats.
 FIGURE 11.2
Choose File ➪ Export and choose the file format to export PDF content from a number of different export 
formats.
Use the menu command and you find file formats exactly the same as those supported in the Save 
As dialog box. (Exceptions in the Export submenu are the Adobe PDF Files (*.pdf) and Adobe PDF 
Files, Optimized (*.pdf) that are only found in the Save As dialog box). Using either the Save As 
dialog box or the Export menu commands results in file exports with options choices that are iden-
tical. You can use either command set to export in the following formats.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
One item you find in the menu command that isn’t available in the Save As dialog 
box is the Export Multiple Files command. Choose this item and you can batch pro-
cess exporting PDF data to a given file format from a selection of multiple files (or folders) on 
your hard drive.

For more on batch processing files, see Chapter 18.
Selecting all but the Adobe PDF Files (*.pdf), Tables in Excel Spreadsheet, and Text (Accessible) 
(*.txt) formats provides user-definable options in the Settings dialog box for the respective file type. 
When you select any of the formats other than the preceding two, the Settings button becomes active. 
Click Settings and the Save As Settings dialog box opens. The various options change according to 
the file format selected from the Save as type pull-down menu (Windows) or Format (Mac) in the 
Save As dialog box.

Part III
Adobe PDF files (*.pdf)
By default the Acrobat PDF Files (*.pdf) format is selected in the Save as type (Windows) or 
Format (Macintosh) pull-down menu. Saving as PDF without changing the filename updates the 
existing PDF by overwriting it.
Adobe PDF Files, Optimized (*.pdf)
Select this option and your file is optimized using the PDF Optimizer and saved in one step.
The Optimized PDF option in the Save As dialog box was introduced in Acrobat 8. Click the 
Settings button in the Save As dialog box and the PDF Optimizer dialog box opens. You can 
choose a preset or make custom adjustments in the PDF Optimizer, and then click OK and click 
Save in the Save As dialog box. Your file is first optimized and then saved to disk.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on using the PDF Optimizer, see Chapter 18.
Encapsulated PostScript (*.eps) 
and PostScript (*.ps)
EPS files are saved as single page files. When multiple-page PDFs are saved to EPS, each page is 
saved as a new EPS document. PostScript files save the PDF to disk like you would print a file to 
disk as PostScript. PostScript files can then be redistilled in Acrobat Distiller to convert back to 
PDF. You can also download PostScript files to PostScript printers through a downloading utility 
or a hot folder, which is used for sending files directly to the printer.
Many of the options for creating either an EPS file or a PostScript file are identical. You’ll notice 
some differences as you travel through the many options found in the Save As Settings dialog box. 
Select either Encapsulated PostScript (*.eps) or PostScript (*.ps) from the Files of type (Format on 
Macintosh) pull-down menu and click the Settings button. The options appear in the Save As 
Settings dialog box. Shown in Figure 11.3 is the EPS Save As Settings dialog box.

General settings
On the left side of the Save As Settings dialog box are several categories for choices you make on 
the right side of the dialog box. The first of the categories is the General settings where you set some 
general attributes for the way an EPS or PostScript file is saved. These settings are as follows:
n Defaults. The Defaults button at the top of the dialog box returns all settings to the origi-
nal defaults. You can access this button at any time as you travel through the various 
option categories in the list at the left side of the dialog box.
n ASCII. PostScript files are encoded as ASCII (American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange). ASCII files are larger than binary files, which is the second option for 
encoding selections.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on color separating EPS files and Acrobat PDF, see Chapter 32.
n Binary. Binary files are much smaller than ASCII files. Use binary encoding when the 
PostScript language level is 2 or 3.

364

Part III
n PostScript. Select the language levels from the pull-down menu choices. For ASCII 
encoding use Language Level 1 from the menu. For exporting EPS files to Adobe 
InDesign, you can use Language Level 2. If you’re using Language Level 2 or 3, select 
binary encoding. Use PostScript 3 only when the output devices use PostScript 3 RIPs.
n Font Inclusion. You have three choices for font inclusion. Choose None to not embed 
fonts. Choose Embedded Fonts to keep the same fonts embedded in the PDF in the 
exported EPS file. Choose Embedded and Referenced Fonts to keep the PDF embedded 
fonts and fonts referenced from fonts loaded in your system. If you’re using a font that is 
not embedded in the PDF document but is loaded as a system font, the font is embedded 
in the resulting PDF.

Chapter 10.
n Include Comments. When the check box is enabled, any comment notes are included in 
the resulting EPS or PostScript document. When the PostScript document is distilled in 
Acrobat Distiller, the comment notes are retained in the resulting PDF document.
n Convert TrueType to Type 1. Check the box to convert TrueType fonts to Type 1 fonts.

If this check box is not enabled, the EPS file appears as a gray box when you place the 
file in another program. The data are all there, but you won’t be able to see the EPS image. 
When this check box is enabled, a preview is embedded in the EPS file. Preview image 
formats are TIFF on Windows and PICT on the Macintosh.
n Page Range. You can export all pages by selecting the All radio button or entering the 
page numbers for a range of pages to be exported. EPS files are exported as individual 
files for each page and automatically numbered by Acrobat.

 FIGURE 11.4
Select Output and the options change to attribute settings designed for printing and prepress.
Output options enable you to control prepress output attributes, including the following:
n Color. The four choices for handling color in resulting EPS and PostScript file(s) are as 
follows:
n Composite. Use this option to export the file as a composite image. If the file is a 
four-color image, you can still import an EPS file in a separating program and print 
separations. The intent for Composite is for use with composite color printing and 
printing separations to non-Adobe PostScript devices. For PostScript files, composites 
can be downloaded directly to PostScript 2 and 3 devices for In-RIP separating.
n Composite Gray. If the files are grayscale, use Composite Gray.
n Separations. This option creates a DCS (Desktop Color Separation) file, and each 
color as well as a composite is exported as separate files. If pre-separating the EPS 
file(s), be certain you use a program such as Adobe InDesign that supports DCS files, 
or you can directly download each plate to your RIP. For PostScript files, the file is 
separated. When you download the PostScript file, all colors print on separate plates.

n In-RIP Separations. This option works only on Adobe PostScript 3 RIPs. A composite 
color image is printed to the RIP and the RIP color separates the composite file.
NOTE
NOTE
Separations and In-RIP Separations are only active when you have your page setup 
set to a PostScript printer.
n Screening. You make choices for screening from this pull-down menu. Unless you have 
some special need for embedding half-tone frequencies in the EPS file, leave the Screening 
set to Default Screen and handle all your frequency control at the RIP. For PostScript 
files, set the screening as desired before downloading the file.
n Trapping. You can apply trapping and choose trap presets.
n Apply Output Preview Settings. Select this option to simulate the output of one device 
on another. This option simulates the output condition defined in the Output Preview 
dialog box on the current output device.
n Transparency Flattener Preset. Choose from High Medium and Low resolutions for 
transparency flattening. Transparency is flattened according to your choice in the resul-
tant EPS file.
n Simulate Overprinting. Overprints and knockouts can be soft-proofed onscreen for 
color-separated devices. The check box is grayed out unless you choose one of the sepa-
ration items in the Color pull-down menu.
n Use Maximum Available JPEG2000 Image Resolution. For any raster images con-
tained in the EPS file export, the file compression uses JPEG2000 at the maximum setting 
when this check box is enabled. If disabled, the original compression level at the time the 
PDF was created is used.
n Ink Manager. Clearing the box on the far left of each color plate eliminates the plate for 
separated files. Scroll the box to see any spot colors and you can select spot colors for 
conversion to CMYK color.

managing inks, see Chapter 32.
Marks and Bleeds
Select the Marks and Bleeds item in the list at the left of the Save As Settings dialog box and the 
options for adding printer’s marks appear, as shown in Figure 11.5.

 FIGURE 11.5
Select Marks and Bleeds to add printer’s marks to the EPS/PS export.
The options are as follows:
n All Marks/Marks. You can check the box for All Marks and all the check boxes below 
the Style menu are checked. You can toggle on or off all check marks to create just the 
marks you want to appear in the resultant file.
n Style. You have choices for compatibility with authoring and illustration programs. 
Choose from different versions of InDesign, Illustrator, or QuarkXPress.
n Line Weight. From the pull-down menu, select line weights for the printer’s marks from 
1/8-, 1/4-, and 1/2-inch choices.
PostScript Options
Click the last item in the list for EPS/PS exports and the options shown in Figure 11.6 appear. The 
PostScript options offer you settings for embedded PostScript attributes in the EPS/PS file.
The PostScript options include the following:
n Font and Resource Policy. You determine how fonts download to a printer’s RIP via 
three choices in the pull-down menu:
n Send at Start. The entire font sets for all pages are downloaded to the printer’s RIP. 
The file prints faster than any of the other methods, but puts a memory burden on the 
printing device to hold all the font matrices in memory during printing.
n Send by Range. Fonts are downloaded from the first page where the fonts are used 
and stays in memory until the job is printed. The font downloading occurs as each 
font is found on a page that uses them. The job prints a little slower than when using 
the Send at Start option, but uses less memory initially as the job is printed.
n Send for Each Page. Fonts encountered on a page are downloaded to the RIP, and 
then flushed as the next page is printed. The second page’s fonts are then downloaded 
and flushed after printing, and so on. This method requires the least memory. Files 
print slower than when using either of the other two methods.

 FIGURE 11.6
Select PostScript Options to add various PostScript printing attributes to the EPS/
PostScript file(s).
n Emit CIDFontType2 as CIDFontType2 (PS Version 2015 and greater). Use this 
option to preserve hinting in the original font when printing. The option is available only 
for Language Level 3 output.
n Emit Undercolor Removal/Black Generation. GCR/UCR removal is necessary only if 
the original document contained assignments in the PostScript file converted to PDF. If 
you want to remove any embedded settings for handling the amount of black or compen-
sating for black generation with different inks, check this box. If you don’t know what 
any of this means, checking the box or not won’t have an effect on your own personal 
documents.
n Emit Halftones. If a halftone frequency was embedded in the original file, you can elimi-
nate it in the exported document. Unless you want to use embedded frequencies, leave 
the box checked in case you accidentally preserved a frequency in the original file for EPS 
files. When printing PostScript files to high-end devices, you’ll want to assign frequencies 
at the time the PostScript file is created.
n Emit Transfer Functions. The same criteria as the preceding bullet apply to transfer 
functions. If you intend to use embedded transfer functions, leave the check box dis-
abled. Otherwise, keep it checked as a default.
n Emit Flatness. Flatness settings applied in Photoshop, Illustrator, or other illustration 
programs are generally applied to clipping paths in images and on vector objects to ease 
the burden of printing complex objects. When checked, the flatness settings applied in 
the original authoring program are honored.
n Emit PS Form Objects. This option relates to PS Form XObjects. XObjects are used to 
create a description of multiple smaller objects repeated several times such as patterns, 
brushes, backgrounds, and so on. Emitting the XObjects reduces the size of the print job; 
however, more memory is needed to RIP the file(s).

Color Management
Color management has been removed from the Output options in Acrobat 8 to a new category for 
Color Management in Acrobat 9. Click Color Management in the left pane and the right pane 
changes to the view you see in Figure 11.7.
 FIGURE 11.7
Click Color Management in the left pane to display choices for managing color and choosing color profiles.
The Color Management options include:
n Color Handling. Make a choice from the pull-down menu for whether you want Acrobat 
or your printer driver to manage color or whether you want to use no color management.
n Color Profile. Choose a color profile from the pull-down menu.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
If you choose to let Acrobat manage color and you also choose a printer profile, 
you’ll end up double profiling your output. The relationship between these two 
options is critical to understand. For a detailed explanation for how to manage color on your 
output, see Chapter 31.
n Apply output preview settings. Check this box to simulate an output on a specific 
printing device.
Click OK in the Save As Settings dialog box and click Save in the Save As dialog box. The PDF is 
exported in EPS or PostScript format, containing all the attributes you described for all the options 
listed earlier.
Because printing in Acrobat Pro takes care of all the print controls you need, exporting EPS files for 
printing is a task you won’t need to perform unless there’s some strange problem that needs to be 
resolved in a file that won’t print. A more practical use for exporting EPS files from Acrobat is if you 
need to import a PDF file in another program that does not support PDF, but does support EPS. In 
such cases you’ll find it helpful to understand all the options you have available for EPS exports.
You have many advantages in creating PostScript files from Acrobat. Files can be redistilled in 
Acrobat Distiller with PDF/X formats for printing and prepress, sometimes as a workaround for 
repurposing documents, and for downloading directly to PostScript devices — particularly for print 
shops using imposition software that only supports PostScript and not PDF.

HTML 3.2 (*.htm), HTML 4.01 with CSS 1.0 (*.htm), 
XML 1.0 (*.xml), and Text (Plain) (*.txt)
Options available for exporting PDFs to HTML files, HTML files with Cascading Style Sheets, Plain 
Text, and XML files all use the same attribute settings. Text is exported according to the encoding 
method you select, and images are exported according to the format option you select. These set-
tings are available when you select any one of the three file formats from the Save as type (Format 
on Macintosh) pull-down menu. Select a format and click the Settings button. The Save As XXX 
Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11.8.
 FIGURE 11.8
To set attributes for file exports for HTML, XML, or TXT files, select one of three file formats in the Save as 
type (Format on Macintosh) pull-down menu and click Settings. The dialog box is called Save As XXX 
Settings, where XXX is the format you selected.
The attribute settings are as follows:
n Encoding. Choose the encoding method from options for Unicode settings (UTF-8, UTF-
16, or UCS-4), ISO-Latin-1, HTML/ASCII, or the default setting of Use mapping table 
default.
n Generate bookmarks. Generates bookmark links to content for HTML or XML docu-
ments. Links are placed at the beginning of the resulting HTML or XML document.
n Generate tags for untagged files. Tags are temporarily created for file conversion for 
untagged documents. You need to select the check box for legacy untagged files or with 
files created with Acrobat 4 in order to complete the conversion. The tags are temporary 
for the conversion to work and are not added to the PDF. If you do not select this for leg-
acy PDFs, you will not get the conversion.

n Generate images. Enable this check box for images to be exported as separate files.
n Use sub-folder. Images are saved to a subfolder below the directory where the HTML 
files are created. The default name for the folder is “images.” In the field box you can 
change the folder name by editing the line of text.
n Use prefix. This option adds prefixes to image filenames. Check the box and supply the 
prefix text in the field box.
n Output format. Three options buttons enable you to determine the file format for the 
saved images. Choose from TIFF, JPG, or PNG.
n Downsample to. Images are downsampled to the setting selected from the pull-down 
menu. The settings are fixed with choices for 72, 96, 150, and 300 pixels per inch (ppi).
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
Exporting to HTML does not preserve page geometry and layout in the HTML file. 
For more information on exporting HTML from Acrobat, see Chapter 27.
JPEG (*.jpg, .jpeg, .jpe), JPEG2000 (.jpf, *.ipx, *.jp2, 
*.j2k, *.j2c, .jpc), PNG (.png), and TIFF (*.tif, *.tiff)
You can export the PDF document as any one of the preceding image file formats. Each entire 
page, including text and images, is exported as a single image file. From the Settings dialog box, 
you choose options for image compression and color management. The options settings for export-
ing image file formats are the same as the options used when importing images in Acrobat with the 
Create PDF From File or From Multiple Files commands discussed in Chapter 7.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
When exporting PDF documents containing images, you cannot achieve a better 
resolution than the resolution in the source file. If you have, for example, a PDF 
document with a TIFF image where the image was originally sampled at 72 ppi, you cannot gain 
any resolution by saving the file from Acrobat as a TIFF file with 300-ppi resolution. The file is 
saved with the resolution you specify in the Save As XXX Settings dialog box, but image resolu-
tions higher than source files are upsized with image interpolation. The results are often unus-
able and produce poor-quality images. If you need image resolutions higher than the source 
images, you need to return to your scanner and scan images at higher resolutions. Re-create the 
original document and convert to PDF.

10 and 32.
Microsoft Word Document (*.doc) and Rich Text 
Format (*.rtf)
For several generations of Acrobat, the Adobe development engineers have continually worked 
hard on preserving layout and appearance in documents exported to Microsoft Word and RTF for-
mats. You’ll find in Acrobat 9 more improvement in these areas, and to date, the best exporting 
features when you want to edit a file in Microsoft Word.

372
Editing PDFs
Part III
You can export PDF files to either Microsoft Word format or Rich Text Format files (RTF). The 
conversion settings include choices for image handling and sampling as well as a new feature for 
handling the document layout. Unlike HTML and XML files, exports to Word and RTF embed the 
images in the exported text files when you choose to export images. Acrobat does not offer an 
option for exporting images apart from the text data.
Be aware that although you can export PDF documents directly to Microsoft Word format, the 
integrity of your file depends on how well you created the PDF. If the PDF was created without 
tags and through less desirable PDF-creation methods, the ultimate file you produce in Word or 
RTF format may not be suitable for editing and converting back to PDF. Inasmuch as tags are 
added during conversion to PDF, the tagged structure is not retained in the resulting file.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on programs supporting exports to PDF as structured and 
tagged files, see Chapters 7, 8, and 25.
Notwithstanding tagging issues, the exports to Microsoft Word from Acrobat 9 are the best I’ve 
seen with any version of Acrobat. Clicking the Settings button in the Save As dialog box for exports 
to Microsoft Word or RTF opens the Save As Settings dialog box. The settings are the same for RTF 
as for Word-formatted file exports (shown in Figure 11.9).
 FIGURE 11.9
Select either Microsoft Word or RTF for the file export and click the Settings button. The options in both 
dialog boxes are identical.

Settings for exporting to Microsoft Word or RTF formats include the following:
n Layout Settings. This is the marvelous new addition to Acrobat 9. You can choose to 
retain the document layout by clicking the Retain Page Layout radio button and the 
exported data appear in Microsoft Word almost exactly as you see the file laid out in 
Acrobat. Choose the Retain Flowing Text option to preserve text reflow.
n Tag quality settings. Select the check box to regenerate tags in the exported document.
n Include Comments. Like EPS and PostScript files discussed earlier, Comment notes can 
be exported to Word or with RTF files. Select the box for Include Comments and the 
Comment notes are exported.
n Include Images. You can extract image files from the PDF and embed them in the .doc 
or .rtf file in either of two formats. Select JPG or PNG for the image file format.
n Use Colorspace. You have choices for colorspaces from a pull-down menu. Choose from 
Determine Automatically, in which case Acrobat determines using either grayscale or 
color, or select Grayscale or Color from the menu options.
n Change Resolution. Downsampling and resolution issues are the same as those noted 
when exporting PDF documents to image formats.

For more information on resolutions and sampling, see Chapter 18. To learn about 
tagging PDF files, see Chapter 25.
PDF/A, PDF/E, PDF/X (*.pdf)
Acrobat supports various standards for different uses and different markets. The PDF/A specifica-
tion is used for archiving PDF documents so that files you create today can be viewed by users 
many years in the future. The PDF/E specification is a standard for engineers creating documents 
such as CAD drawings. The PDF/X specification is used by the print industry for insuring proper 
output on commercial printing devices. Each of the choices you have in the Save As/Export menus 
offer settings respective to the standard.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on adjusting settings for PDF standards, see Chapter 10.
Tables in Excel Spreadsheets (*.xml)
You can export tables to XML files that can be read by Microsoft Excel. In order to successfully 
export a table, the original file needs to have been created as a table in a program like Microsoft 
Word or Excel. If you try to export columns and rows that were not created as a table in an author-
ing program, no data are exported from the PDF file.
In handling table data exports, if the Save As ➪ Tables in Excel Spreadsheets command doesn’t 
work, you have other options for exporting table data using the Select tool to select a table and 
choosing either Save As Table or Open Table in Spreadsheet from a context menu opened on the 
selected data.

Text (Accessible) (*.txt)
Files are saved as text. For tagged PDF documents made accessible, all alternative text used to 
describe items like images and form fields that are contained in the document tags are converted 
to text. The alternate tags can be viewed in the Tags palette in Acrobat but won’t necessarily appear 
in the document page. When you export PDFs as Accessible Text, the text is generated in the body 
of the document.

Summary
n Using the Save As command and overwriting a PDF document optimizes it and can 
sometimes result in much smaller file sizes.
n Acrobat can save PDFs in a variety of different formats. Many formats have an elaborate 
number of options settings to set attributes for the saved files.

375
I
n Acrobat versions 6 and 7, we had a menu command for creating a 
single PDF from multiple files of different file formats. In Acrobat 8 we 
saw some improvements to combining files into a single PDF document, 
and we were introduced to PDF Packages. Acrobat 9 has not only built on 
features for combining and packaging files, the new improvements in the 
latest release are no less than spectacular.
Now in Acrobat 9 we can view content created in any application and con-
vert pages, selections, and other user-defined content to PDF. PDF Packages 
have given way to the new PDF Portfolios, where you can combine multiple 
documents in a portfolio displayed in a new user interface, with many options 
you can choose to display your content such as adding Flash animation, ani-
mated views for scrolling documents, and creating custom cover pages.
In addition to using the Combine Files options and creating PDF Portfolios, 
I tossed in adding file attachments to PDF documents and cover the various 
options you have with adding attachments to PDFs and PDF Portfolios.
Read on to explore new Acrobat 9 features for merging files into single PDF 
documents and assembling files into PDF Portfolios, and learn some of the 
methods Acrobat provides you for attaching files to your documents.
Setting Up the Work Environment
Creating merged documents and PDF Portfolios requires no special tools 
loaded other than the default toolbars. However, later in this chapter I talk 
about adding file attachments that in some ways appear similar to files added 
in a PDF Portfolio. Therefore, you’ll want to load some commenting tools.

When you get to the section related to working with file attachments, open a context menu on the 
Toolbar Well and select More Tools. Scroll down to the Comment & Markup toolbar and check 
the box adjacent to Attach a File as a Comment and check the box adjacent to Record Audio 
Comment. Check the box adjacent to the Comment & Markup toolbar and click OK.
Open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and select Dock Toolbars.
Note that if you want to work exclusively with combining files and creating PDF Portfolios, you 
don’t need to bother using the Comment & Markup toolbar. In this chapter, the Comment & 
Markup toolbar is loaded in the “Working with File Attachments” section at the end of the chapter.
Merging Files into a Single PDF document
The Adobe Acrobat development team has spent considerable time over the last few versions of 
Acrobat to improve and deliver methods for us to combine multiple files into PDF documents. 
Adobe claims their research has found most knowledge workers today want to communicate 
messages based on the delivery of different files created in different authoring programs.
You might have a spreadsheet created in Excel, a presentation created in PowerPoint, an advertise-
ment created in Adobe InDesign, and a media file created in Adobe Flash that collectively deliver 
the message you want to communicate or a file you want to share for comment and review.
In Acrobat 8 we had the Combine Files menu command that was used to combine multiple files 
of different types into a single PDF document. The Acrobat 9 command for combining files is 
Merge Files into a Single PDF. Although the nomenclature has changed, the results are the same. 
The Merge Files into a Single PDF command is used to combine native authoring application files 
such as a PowerPoint file, a Word File, a PDF file, and any other file formats compatible with the 
Create PDF From File command and merge them into a single PDF document.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on the file formats Acrobat supports for conversion to PDF, 
see Chapter 7.
The Merge Files into a Single PDF command enables you to combine files of any type and neatly 
organize the order of your files in the Combine Files wizard before creating the composite document.
Combining files is handled from the Create task button in the Tasks toolbar or from a menu com-
mand (File ➪ Combine ➪ Merge Files into a Single PDF) or the menu File ➪ Create PDF ➪ Merge 
Files into a Single PDF. In Figure 12.1, you can see the pull-down menu and the menu choices 
you have in the Combine Files task button. The Merge Files into Single PDF command is used to 
merge files from a number of different formats including PDF into a single document. The 
Assemble Files into a Portfolio command creates a package of documents assembled into a single 
PDF Portfolio file.

 FIGURE 12.1
The Create task button provides two commands used for merging files and creating a PDF Portfolio.
Combining files and folders on Windows
When you want to combine files into a single PDF document you can click the Create task button 
and select Merge Files into a Single PDF. Likewise you can choose File ➪ Combine ➪ Merge Files 
into a Single PDF or the menu File ➪ Create PDF ➪ Merge Files into a Single PDF. Either action 
opens the Combine Files dialog box. Before you use the command, there are a few restrictions you 
have with regard to the types of files you can combine. These restrictions include:
 PDFs with security. PDFs with security cannot be combined using this command.
 Adobe LiveCycle Designer XML Forms. Any form created in Adobe LiveCycle Designer 
cannot be added using this command.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on Adobe LiveCycle Designer XML forms, see Chapter 35.
 Digital signatures. You can use this command to add files that have digital signatures, 
but the signatures are removed when you combine the files.
 Form fields. Adding a form is no problem using the Merge Files into a Single PDF com-
mand, but if you have different files using the same field names, the fields are merged 
into one field. For example, if you merge a form populated with data and another identi-
cal form with the fields left blank, the data are merged together. The order of the files to 
be merged is important. If you have two identical forms and merge them with the blank 
fields file listed in the first position, both forms are merged and the second form (popu-
lated with field data) now appears with empty fields. Conversely, if the populated fields 
file is in the topmost position in the list along with a file with blank fields, both docu-
ments appear with the same data when you combine them. In other words, forms with 
identical field names inherit data from the first form in a list of files you merge.
Before I go on to explain all the features available to you when merging files into a single PDF 
document, launch Acrobat and follow along to see how easy it is to merge files using the revised 
Combine Files wizard.

STEPS: Using the Combine Files command (Windows)
 
1. Click the Combine task button. From the pull-down menu, select Merge Files into a 
Single PDF.
 
2. Select files to merge. When you select Merge Files into a Single PDF, the Combine Files 
wizard opens. Click the Add Files button and a pull-down menu opens. From the menu 
options choose Add Files. The Add Files dialog box opens, where you can browse your 
hard drive and select individual files to merge into a single PDF document. Select files 
you want to add to the file list and click the Add Files button. You can click a file and 
add it to the file list and click Add Files again and locate files in different folders. If you 
have a folder containing all the files you want to combine, you can choose the Add Folder 
item from the Add Files pull-down menu. All files within a folder are then added to the list.
 
 In Figure 12.2, I added several documents to my list: a Flash SWF file, three InDesign 
files, a Word file, an Excel file, and two PowerPoint files. Note that all files are in native 
file format.
 FIGURE 12.2
Click the Add Files button to add files to a list.
TIP
TIP
Multiple files within the same folder can be added to your list. Click a file and 
Shift+click to select a group of files listed in a contiguous order. Click and press 
Ctrl/Ô+click to select files in a noncontiguous order.
 
3. Arrange the files in the order you want them to appear in the merged PDF document. 
Click a file in the list and use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to arrange the files 
in the order you want them to appear in the resultant PDF document.

4. Choose Pages. Click a file in the list and the Choose Pages button becomes active (see 
Figure 12.3). Note that if you select an Excel document, the Choose Pages button changes 
to Choose Sheets, and selecting a PowerPoint file changes the button name to Choose 
Slides. In my example, I selected an Excel Workbook (.xls file).
 FIGURE 12.3
Select a file and click Choose Pages (or Sheets or Slides).
 
5. Select Pages (or Sheets or Slides). A preview of your document is displayed in a sepa-
rate window. You can scroll pages, worksheets, slides, and so on to preview the pages. At 
the top of the window you can make choices for the pages you want to add to the single 
PDF file. Make your choices and click OK.
 
6. Create the merged PDF document. Click Combine Files in the wizard window. Any 
files you added to your list that need conversion to PDF are converted on the fly. The 
original authoring program opens and files are converted to PDF. Wait for Acrobat to 
complete the conversion and concatenation and you’ll be prompted to save your compos-
ite document.
 
7. Save the composite file. When prompted to save the file, click Save. A Save As dialog 
box opens. Type a name for your file, navigate to the folder you want to use for your 
saved file, and click Save again.
 
8. Review the resultant PDF file. The composite file opens in the Acrobat Document pane. 
Click the Bookmarks tab in the Navigation pane. Notice that any bookmarks in your 

380

original PDFs containing bookmarks are preserved. Additional bookmarks are added to 
the file linking the first page of each separate document to a bookmark. In Figure 12.4, 
you see my composite document with the Bookmarks pane open.

Combining files and folders on the Macintosh
As I mentioned in Chapter 8 when I covered converting Microsoft Office files to PDF, the pre-
ferred way to convert the files is to use the PDF Printer. Since the PDFMaker is not available on 
the Mac, you won’t find native file format support for Merge Files into a Single PDF using MS 
Office applications.
You can use other file formats on the Mac such as Adobe InDesign .indd files, Adobe Illustrator .ai 
files, Adobe Flash .swf and .fla, image file formats such as gif, jpg, etc., and HTML files. Mac users 
can also use the Choose Pages button for MS Office files after you convert them to PDF. The nice 
thing about the Merge Files command is that you can also add PDF documents to the merged file.

CAUTION 
CAUTION
If you import video, sound, or Flash media in an Adobe InDesign file, you must use 
the Export command in InDesign to Export to Adobe PDF. In the Export Adobe PDF 
dialog box be certain to use compatibility above Acrobat 5 and check the Interactive Elements 
check box. This box must be checked for the media to show up in the resultant PDF document. 
Unfortunately, Adobe InDesign won’t hold the last preset you chose in the program, so there’s 
no way to use the Merge Files into a Single PDF command that will include the interactive ele-
ments when converting to PDF using the merge files command.
Using the Combine Files wizard
In Acrobat 8, the Combine Files wizard had two panes where you could choose attributes for your 
combined files or PDF Packages. In Acrobat 9, the Merge Files into a Single PDF document uses a 
single pane in the wizard, and the new PDF Portfolios are created in a separate interface. A few of 
the options you can choose in the Combine Files wizard in Acrobat 9 include:
As a first order of business, let’s take a look at adding files to the wizard window when you first 
open the Combine Files dialog box. At the top of the wizard is a pull-down menu used to add files 
for combining into a single PDF document, as shown in Figure 12.5.
 FIGURE 12.5
The Add Files pull-down menu displays four menu commands used to add files to the wizard list of files.
Your choices are as follows:
 Add Files. Use this menu command to open the Add Files dialog box. This dialog box 
behaves similar to an Open dialog box where you can navigate your hard drive and locate 
files to add to the list in the first pane.
 
 If you select a secure PDF or a file created in Adobe LiveCycle Designer, a warning mes-
sage appears in the Combine Files dialog box as shown in Figure 12.6. As stated in the 
message, you cannot combine the selected file and must use the PDF Portfolio option if 
you want to merge the file with other documents.
 Add Folders. Use this command to add a folder of files.

 FIGURE 12.6
A warning appears for all files that are not supported in the Combine Files wizard.
 Reuse Files. Choose this menu command and the Reuse Files dialog box shown in 
Figure 12.7 opens. Once you’ve created a PDF by combining files, you can open the 
Reuse Files dialog box and use one or any number of files combined together in a 
previous file.
 
On the left side of the dialog box you see a list of files used in a previous session that 
were combined to create a single PDF document. On the right you see files made avail-
able for reuse. Click a file in the right pane and click Add Files to reuse it. The file is 
then added to the list in the Combine Files wizard.
 FIGURE 12.7
Reuse Files enables you to select files used in a previous Combine Files session in a new 
session.
 Add Open Files. You can choose the Merge Files into a Single PDF command without 
having a file open in the Document pane. If you have a file open when you open the 
wizard window, you can choose to add your open file to other files you add to the list.
TIP
TIP
From the desktop you can select files in a folder, open a context menu, and choose 
Combine supported files in Acrobat. When you release the mouse button, the files 
are added to the Combine Files wizard, where you can choose pages and merge the files into a 
single PDF document. If you want to convert the files to separate PDFs, choose the Convert to 
PDF command in the same context menu.

Organizing files
As you move below the file list in the wizard window, a series of buttons appear for organizing 
pages in the file you ultimately create, as shown in Figure 12.8.
 FIGURE 12.8
Buttons below the file list are used to organize pages.
Your options include:
 Move Up. Click a file and click the Move Up button and the file is reordered in the list. If 
the file you select is at the top of the list, the Move Up button is grayed out and unusable.
 Move Down. This button behaves the opposite of the Move Up button. Clicking the but-
ton moves a selected or several selected files down. When you select a file at the bottom 
of the list, the button is grayed out and unusable.
 Remove. As you might suspect, clicking this button removes any selected file(s) from 
the list.
 Choose Pages/Sheets/Slides/Layouts/Sheet Selection. This option is available only 
for multiple page documents and documents of certain file types. Most MS Office files 
are compatible with the Choose (button text) option. Click this button and the Preview 
Selected button text dialog box opens. The button text varies according to the file type 
you choose to add in the Combine Files dialog box. For MS Word files the button text 
is Choose Pages. With MS Excel the button text is Choose Sheets. AutoCAD files appear 
with Choose Layout. Microsoft Visio files appear with Sheet Selection. If you select a 
PowerPoint file, the button name changes to Choose Slides. Clicking any option opens a 
Preview dialog box like the one shown when I select Choose Slides with a PowerPoint file 
selected as shown in Figure 12.9.
TIP
TIP
If you want to open the Preview and Select Pages/Slides dialog box, you can also 
double-click on a file in the list window.
NOTE
NOTE
For simplicity, I’ll refer to the item appearing in the Choose button as simply 
Choose or Choose Pages button when describing options for choosing pages/
sheets/layouts and so on in the sections ahead.

 FIGURE 12.9
Click Choose Pages to open a dialog box where pages in a file can be previewed.
Previewing files
Files of several different file types — primarily those of the Microsoft Office flavor and PDF 
documents — permit you to create a PDF preview and choose pages within the document to add 
to your resultant file, and also offer many different editing features. However, what you do in the 
Preview window cannot be saved. If you want to alter content you need to return to the original 
authoring program and make your edits, then export back to PDF.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information regarding exporting to PDF, see Chapter 7. For information 
related to Microsoft Office and PDF creation, see Chapter 8.
Once again, I can’t cover all the options available to you when previewing files, but here are a few 
examples available with some Office applications:
 Microsoft Word. Click a multipage Word document in the file list and click Choose 
Pages, or simply double-click the Word document and the document opens in the 
Preview and Select Page Range dialog box. You can select specific pages you want added 
to the combined file by typing values in the Pages text box at the top of the dialog box. 
Noncontiguous pages are separated by commas and contiguous pages are separated by 
dashes. For example, 1,3,7-9 denotes using pages 1, 3, and 5 through 7 for adding to the 
combined file.

385

In long documents, it would be helpful to see a view of the document pages so you know 
what pages you want to include in your combined file. The Preview and Select Page Range 
dialog box offers you just that. In addition, you can make a number of temporary edits 
through commands from a context menu, as shown in Figure 12.10. For example, if you 
want to see a preview of your document with a larger font size, you can use the Font 
options to change font attributes.
 FIGURE 12.10
Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Macintosh) to open a context menu where some 
editing commands appear.
 
Be aware that any edits you make won’t be applied to the combined file. What you see 
available are commands designed to help you view files using temporary changes you can 
make to the document. If you need to make the changes permanent and reflected in the 
resultant PDF document, you must return to the original authoring program, make the 
changes, and save the file.
 
You can browse documents by tables, graphics, sections, comments, and much more. 
Just click the circle between the Previous and Next Page buttons represented by double 
arrowheads in the lower-right corner of the dialog box. A pop-up menu, shown in Figure 
12.11, appears where you can choose to browse your file according to any one of 12 dif-
ferent options. All of the options are used for navigational purposes only. You can, for 
example, jump to different comments in a file, browse a file by section number, browse 
by table, and so on.

 FIGURE 12.11
Click the small circle between the Previous and Next Page arrows to open a pop-up 
menu used for browsing different content.
 Microsoft Excel. Double-click an Excel Workbook file in the wizard window or click 
and select Choose Sheets. The Preview and Select Sheets dialog box opens, as shown 
earlier in Figure 12.3. As with MS Word, you also have context menu commands. An 
entire workbook can be displayed and you can scroll the pages selecting only the pages 
you want to appear in your combined file.
 Microsoft PowerPoint. You can choose a Slide Sorter view and an Outline view in 
PowerPoint which you open in much the same way as when opening Word and Excel 
files. In Figure 12.9, slides are shown in the Slide Sorter view.
 
PowerPoint files can also be viewed with content changes, but like other files, the changes 
are only temporary while in the Preview dialog box. From a context menu you have 
choices for deleting slides, changing the slide design, changing layout, and changing the 
background.
Other similar options are available with Microsoft Visio files, Microsoft Project and Publisher files, 
and a number of different file formats including AutoCAD DWG and DWF files. Your clue as to 
whether you have an option to open files in the Preview dialog box is whether you see an active 
Choose button in the Combine Files wizard. If the button is grayed out, you don’t have the option 
to preview pages.
Conversion options
On the right side of the bottom of the Combine Files dialog box you have three icons. These icons 
offer options for file optimization. Click Smaller File Size and images are downsampled to 150 ppi 
and compressed with a low-quality JPEG compression scheme. The file size will typically be smaller 
than your original file unless you used lower resolution images and low-quality JPEG compression. 
Click Default File Size (middle icon) to preserve the original file resolutions and the image size 
attributes are the same setting identified in the Edit ➪ Preferences ➪ Convert to PDF Settings. Click 
Larger File Size to create a file with optimum results. You may not see much difference in file sizes 
between Default and Larger file sizes if you used high-resolution images and high-quality JPEG 
compression.
NOTE
NOTE
Using Larger File Size does not upsample images. The image resolution won’t be 
greater than the default resolution used when an image was saved. The primary 
change you experience with this option is when JPEG compression is set to Maximum Quality. 
If you saved your images with Medium Quality, the quality setting is changed.

387
Combining, Packaging, and Attaching PDFs

These buttons affect files that need to be converted to PDF, and PDF documents. When PDF docu-
ments are included and you make a choice for the file size, the PDF Optimizer is used to resample 
images.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Creating Smaller File Sizes can result in much longer times to create a combined 
file. This option downsamples each image above 150 ppi and requires more time to 
produce the resultant PDF than the other two options.
At the very bottom of the wizard window the Help, Combine Files, and Cancel buttons should be 
self-explanatory. Additionally, you have an Options button. Click the Options button and the 
Options dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 12.12.
 FIGURE 12.12
Click the Options button at the bottom of the first pane in the wizard to open the Options for Conversion 
Settings dialog box.
The four options you have are
 Always enable accessibility and reflow. This item makes your PDF conversions accessible.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on accessibility, see Chapter 25.
 Always add bookmarks to Adobe PDF. By default, the check box is enabled. If you don’t 
want bookmarks added to the resultant file, remove the check mark.
 Continue combining if an error occurs. If a file cannot be combined for one reason 
or another, you can halt the process by removing the check mark. If the check box is 
enabled, Acrobat skips over corrupt files and files that cannot be added to the merged 
document.
 Convert all files to PDF when creating a Portfolio. This choice relates to PDF Portfolios 
where you can package documents in a PDF wrapper and either convert to PDF or keep 
the files in their native file format. Remove the check mark if you don’t want the files 
converted to PDF in a PDF Portfolio.

Part III
Working with PDF Portfolios
Acrobat 8 provided a way to package PDF documents together in the form of a PDF Package. The 
primary thinking behind the PDF Package in Acrobat 8 was to permit you to do all the things you 
couldn’t do when combining PDFs such as:
 Secure files. PDF Packages enabled you to add secure files. In order to add a secure file 
to a package, you need the password(s).
 Adobe Designer XML forms. PDF Packages enabled you to combine files that were 
created in Adobe Designer.
 PDF forms. Actually this can be both PDF forms and XML forms. When you combine 
forms having identical field names, the data fields remain undisturbed.
 Preserve original document format. When you use Merge Files into a Single PDF, any 
document other than PDF is converted to PDF as long as the file format is compatible 
with the Create PDF From File command. When creating a PDF Package, files appear 
with a PDF preview but they retain original file format attributes and can be exported 
from the package back to the original file format.
In addition to the reasons stated in the above bullet points, PDF Packages were used for aggregating 
data from PDF forms and exporting form data to spreadsheets.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
What you had available in Acrobat 8 in terms of creating PDF Packages was a new, 
impressive Acrobat feature. All the advantages for having PDF Packages have been 
implemented in Acrobat 9, but Adobe introduces a new method for packaging PDF content in 
the form of PDF Portfolios.
PDF Portfolios should be thought of more as a revelation in Acrobat functionality rather than an 
enhancement on packaging files. You have all the advantages you had available with PDF Packages, 
but PDF Portfolios are much more. In short, the focus of PDF Portfolios is on presentation, and it’s 
presentation in a big way. The Adobe engineers have given you a new interface and new methods 
for displaying content in very exciting ways.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
PDF Portfolios can also be created from Microsoft Outlook e-mails and when com-
piling returned forms. To learn how PDF Portfolios are used with Microsoft Outlook, 
see Chapter 8. To learn more about compiling form data, see Chapter 35.
When you create a PDF Portfolio, you create a much different result than when merging files into 
one PDF document. PDF Portfolios are PDF documents and/or native application documents 
assembled together in a package (or collection) similar to adding file attachments to a PDF. The 
documents appear in a new interface introduced in Acrobat 9. During the assembly of a PDF 
Portfolio you have many different choices for how you want to display your portfolio and the 
documents contained therein.
PDF Portfolios opened in Acrobat 8 appear as PDF Packages. The coversheet for the PDF Package 
is a default coversheet created by Adobe and installed with your Acrobat installation. As you can 
see in Figure 12.13, a PDF Portfolio opened in Acrobat 8 informs the user that to see all features in 
a PDF Portfolio, the user needs to upgrade to Acrobat or Adobe Reader 9.

If you open a PDF Portfolio in Acrobat 7, the file appears very similar to PDF Packages opened in 
Acrobat 8 viewers. In Acrobat 7 you see the coversheet and the files appear as file attachments.

chapter.
Creating a PDF Portfolio
To understand a little more about PDF Portfolios, let’s first start by following some steps to create 
a portfolio and then look at some of the attributes for working in the new Acrobat 9 PDF Portfolio 
interface. You start a PDF Portfolio assembly by using one of several commands. You can choose 
File ➪ Create PDF Portfolio, File ➪ Combine ➪ Assemble PDF Portfolio, open the Create task but-
ton and choose Assemble PDF Portfolio, open the Combine task button and select Assemble PDF 
Portfolio, or if you are already in the Combine Files wizard you can click the PDF Portfolio radio 
button. Regardless of which menu command you use, the Acrobat user interface changes to the 
PDF Portfolio interface where you add files, edit display appearances, specify document details, 
choose from among different publish options, and more.

To create a PDF Portfolio, follow these steps.
STEPS: Creating a PDF Portfolio
 
1. Click the Combine Files task button (or open the File ➪ Combine menu) and choose 
Assemble PDF Portfolio). After selecting the menu command, the Acrobat interface 
changes to the PDF Portfolio interface where you begin your portfolio assembly.
 
2. Add files to the portfolio. Click the Add Files button in the lower left corner of the PDF 
Portfolio interface and the Add Files dialog box opens. Select files and click Open in the 
dialog box. Your files are shown in the portfolio, similar to what you see in Figure 12.14.
 FIGURE 12.14

3. Choose a layout. The right panel contains many different categories for customizing the 
portfolio Welcome Page and options for changing color schemes, adding file details, and 
publishing your portfolio. At the top of the panel click Choose a Layout. Below the Choose 
a Layout text you find a pull-down menu. Open the menu and choose Revolve from the 
list. The display of the files changes to an appearance similar to Apple Computer’s Cover 
Flow interface shown in Figure 12.15. In Adobe terms the design is called Revolve.
 FIGURE 12.15
Select Revolve from the Choose a Layout panel and the document display changes to a 
Cover Flow–type layout called Revolve.
 
4. Add a Welcome & Header. Click the Add Welcome & Header button in the right panel 
and choose an option for the display of the Welcome page and a custom header. In my 
example I chose Logo & Text in the right panel as shown in Figure 12.16. Click the Add 
an Image item in the header to add a logo or photo. Type the text you want in the Add a 
title field and the header information is complete.

392

 FIGURE 12.16
Add a Welcome & Header to the portfolio.
 
5. Save the portfolio. By default, Acrobat saves your portfolio as Portfolio1, Portfolio2, 
Portfolio3, and so on (in a single editing session) if you don’t modify the file name. To 
save the portfolio with a name of your choosing, select File ➪ Save Portfolio As. In the 
Save As dialog box locate a target folder and type a name for your portfolio. Click the 
Save button and the file is saved.
 
6. Review the portfolio. Close and reopen the file. Browse the files contained in the portfo-
lio by clicking the navigation buttons or icons in the portfolio. For my example where I 
used the Revolve look and added a Welcome & Header, the appearance is shown in 
Figure 12.17.

The steps outlined here are but a fraction of the choices you have for customizing the view and 
adding options for PDF Portfolios. Much more is available to you, including Flash animations you 
can add to the Home view of your portfolios.
Examining the portfolio interface
Many options are available to you in creating and setting up the display of PDF Portfolios. Some 
of the options you have relate to how you set up a portfolio for users to view your work, and other 
options relate to your editing tasks in creating the portfolios. When you choose a menu command 
such as File ➪ Create PDF Portfolio, the interface shown in Figure 12.18 opens. The various tools 
and menu choices you have include:

A. Home. Click this button and you return to the Home view. By default, the Home view is 
shown when you open a PDF Portfolio.
B. List View. Click this button and the files you add to the portfolio are shown in a list 
view. Choices you make in the Specify Details panel (shown in Figure 12.18) in the Edit 
Portfolio panel are displayed in columns in the list view.
C. Preview. Click this button and you change to a Preview mode where you see a selected 
file in a Preview interface.
D. Open Welcome Page. Click this button and the Welcome page opens. This button is 
handy when you use an Adobe Flash file for the welcome page and when previewing text 
and images added to the design of the Welcome page.
E. Save. The Save pull-down menu offers three options. You can click Save Portfolio from 
the menu choices and the file is updated as you make new edits. Click Save Portfolio 
As and save the portfolio under a new file name. Click Save Files from Portfolio and a 
Browse for Folder dialog box opens. You can create a new folder or locate an existing 

395

12
folder on your hard drive and save selected files from within the portfolio as separate files 
to a folder. Note that you do not create a new portfolio, and you must select individual 
files for the menu command to be active.
F. Print. Only PDF files can be printed using this tool. If you have other file types added to 
a portfolio, you must open the native authoring program and print the file from that pro-
gram. When the Print dialog box opens you can choose to Print All PDF Files and you 
can Preview all PDFs and all pages within the PDFs.
G. Share. The Share pull-down menu offers two menu choices. Choose Share Portfolio on 
Acrobat.com to share the file with other users, or choose Email to add the portfolio as an 
attachment to a new message in your default e-mail client.
H. Modify. The Modify pull-down menu offers several choices as shown in Figure 12.19.
 FIGURE 12.19
Open the Modify pull-down menu to view more editing options.
 Close Edit Portfolio. Choose the first menu command to close editing mode and 
enter Viewer mode. If you change to the Viewer mode and choose the Modify ➪ Edit 
Portfolio command you return to Edit Portfolio mode.
 Add Files, Add Existing Folder, Create New Folder. See items M, N, and O later in 
this section.
 Delete. Click a file in the portfolio and choose Delete to remove the file from the 
portfolio.
 Convert to PDF. Select a native file format and click Convert to PDF to convert the 
file to a PDF document.
 Convert to Flash Movie. For supported file formats, choose this option to convert to 
an Adobe Flash SWF movie file.
 Reduce File Size. For PDF documents, select a PDF and choose this option to reduce 
file size. This command is the same as using the Document ➪ Reduce File Size menu 
command.
 Secure Portfolio. Choose this command to add security to the portfolio.

I. Menu bar. The Menu bar offers menu options the same as when in Viewer mode in 
Acrobat. Some menu choices are grayed out if they don’t work while in a portfolio view.
J. Search. Type search criteria in the text box and click the search icon (represented by a 
pair of binoculars) or press the Enter key on your keyboard and Acrobat searches all files 
in the portfolio. Results are reported in a Results panel as shown in Figure 12.20.
 FIGURE 12.20
Type search criteria in the Search text box and press Enter. The results are shown in a 
Results panel.
 
When you click an item in the Results panel, the document where the found word(s) exists 
opens in the foreground in your Layout view. For example, if you set up your portfolio 
using the Revolve design, clicking a result in the Search panel rotates the files to open the 
file containing the results in the foreground. Double-clicking a result opens the found word 
in the respective document in Viewer mode. Positioning the cursor over a found word listed 
in the Results panel displays the page number where the result was found.

K. Document pane. The portfolio Document pane is where you see files added to a portfo-
lio. You can add files to a portfolio by dragging files from your desktop to the Document 
pane or using the Add Files tools. Double-click any file in the Document pane and the 
file opens in Preview mode. In Preview mode you’ll find an Open button. Click this but-
ton and the file opens in Viewer mode in Acrobat for PDF files, where you can navigate 
pages and edit the PDF. When opening other file types, the files open in the original 
authoring application.

L. Edit Portfolio panel. You have several choices in this panel for creating displays of the 
files and the portfolio. The items include:
 Choose a Layout. From the pull-down menu choose from Animated, Basic Layouts, 
or Organized. As you choose a menu item, the Document pane reflects your choice, 
enabling you to view files in different layouts.
 Add Welcome & Header. Click Add Welcome & Header and you are offered two 
choices. One choice is for adding a Welcome page and the other choice is for adding a 
Header. The Welcome page is shown when in the Home view (when clicking the Open 
the Welcome Page tool) and the Header is shown when viewing both the Welcome 
page and all files in the portfolio.
 Select a Color Scheme. You can change the interface color by choosing a color scheme 
from a list of preset colors, or click Customize Color Scheme and choose from an RGB 
color palette as shown in Figure 12.21. Colors can be represented in RGB and Web 
Safe color values. Web Safe color values can be edited by selecting colors in the color 
spectrum or by typing hexadecimal values in the text boxes adjacent to the items 
listed for primary and secondary colors.
 FIGURE 12.21

 Specify File Details. File details appear when you view the portfolio in a List view. 
The items shown in columns in the List view are determined from the choices you 
make in the Specify File Details panel as shown in Figure 12.22. Acrobat has a set of 
predefined detail items appearing in the panel. Click the check boxes for all items you 
want displayed in the List view.  Additionally, you can add custom descriptions by 
typing a column title in the Add a column text box and clicking the Plus icon. The 
custom detail items are then editable in the List view.
 FIGURE 12.22
Click Specify Details and check the boxes for the items you want displayed when view-
ing files in List view.
 Publish. The Publish choices you have are similar to the Save and Publish pull-down 
menu choices. For the Save item, you have only one option for saving the portfolio. 
The other two options for sharing on Acrobat.com and Emailing the portfolio are 
identical to the Share pull-down menu choices.
M. Add Files. Click Add Files and the Add Files dialog box opens. You select individual files 
using this option.
N. Add Existing Folder. Assume you work on a project and save files to a common folder. 
You might have an advertisement created in Adobe InDesign, a cover letter created in MS 
Word, a PowerPoint presentation that was converted with Adobe Presenter as an Adobe 
Flash file, a spreadsheet created in MS Excel, and a few PDF documents related to the 

399
Combining, Packaging, and Attaching PDFs
12
same project. If these files are all saved to the same folder, click Add Existing Folder. The 
Browse for Folder dialog box opens where you can select the folder in question, click OK, 
and all the files in the folder are added to the portfolio.
O. Create New Folder. This choice is used to create a new folder inside the portfolio. Click 
the button and the New Folder dialog box opens. Type a name for the folder and click OK. 
The new folder then appears in the portfolio. Double-click the folder and then click Add 
Files to add files to the folder. When you view files inside the folder, Acrobat displays text 
above the folder to show the directory path for nested folders. The first item is Home. This 
is a hot link that takes you back to the Home view. Click Home as you see in Figure 12.23 
and you return to the Home view.
 FIGURE 12.23
Click Home to return to the Home view.
Working with context menus in portfolios
When you add files to a portfolio, you have access to the interface controls described in the section 
“Examining the portfolio interface.” Some of the options you have from the interface tools and 
menus are also available in a context menu when you right-click (Control+click on Macintosh) on 
a file. Additionally, there are a few context menu commands that you don’t find in other areas in 
the portfolio interface.
Open a context menu on a file in a portfolio and you see the menu options as shown in Figure 12.24. 
A few options not yet discussed include:
Three items exist in the context menu that you don’t find from the tools in the portfolio interface. 
The Select All and Deselect All commands enable you to select or deselect files in the portfolio. You 
might use Select All (also available by pressing Ctrl/Ô+A) and then choose Convert to PDF for files 
that were added from native file formats.
The Properties menu choice opens a File Properties dialog box. Here you can type a description as 
shown in Figure 12.25. The description you add to the File Properties dialog box is dynamically 
displayed when you view files in the List View mode and check the Description check box in the 
Specify File Details panel.

Editing PDF Portfolios
Earlier in this chapter, in the section “Examining the portfolio interface,” I covered a brief descrip-
tion of the options you have in the Edit Portfolio panel. The introduction gives you a general idea 
of the kind of editing choices you can make in the individual panels.
There still remains much more in terms of detail that can be discussed related to several panels. In 
this section, I’ll cover the more finite details for adding some polish to your portfolio presentations.
Choosing layouts
Click Choose a Layout in the Edit PDF Portfolio panel and you find four choices for the portfolio 
layout under the Basic Layout category. In Figure 12.15, shown earlier in this chapter, you can see 
the Revolve layout. Your other choices include Basic Grid, On an Image and Sliding Row.
Using the Basic Grid Layout
Click Basic Grid in the Basic Layouts menu. The Basic Grid choice displays a thumbnail image of 
the first page in PDF documents and an icon for native files along with the filename (see Figure 
12.14). In addition, you see the description of the file that is provided when you address the File 
Properties and type a description. Regardless of whether the Description check box is checked in 
the Specify File Details panel, the description always appears in this view.
Using the On an Image Layout
Click On an Image and the left pane changes to display a button. Click the Pick an Image button

the file names from the bottom of the PDF Portfolio window and arrange them on top of the image 
as shown in Figure 12.27.

Working with Image Files
W
hen importing images in the On an Image mode, try to use images that have been ghosted or 
contain transparency. A ghosted image is one that appears with more white than black so the 
image appears faded. You can easily ghost an image in Adobe Photoshop by using the Edit ➪ Fill 
command. In the Fill dialog box choose White for the color, and choose an opacity value of 70% or 
more. When you add files on top of the image, you’ll see more contrast between the file names and 
icons and the background image.
If you have a logo or irregular-shaped image you want to use for the Organized Layout, you may 
want to have the graphic appear with transparency on the edges — something like a circular object 
where you want the area outside the circle to remain transparent. You can easily handle the task of 
adding transparency by opening an image in Adobe Photoshop and placing the object on a layer. 
Note that if you create a logo in a program like Adobe Illustrator, you can open the file in Photoshop 
and the object appears on a layer with transparency.
To preserve transparency, use the File ➪ Save for Web & Devices command. In the Save for Web & 
Devices dialog box, choose GIF for the format and check the transparency check box. A preview is 
displayed to show you all the transparency that will be preserved in the resultant file. The GIF image 
can then be imported into the PDF Portfolio with transparency preserved.

Ideally, you’ll want to use a ghosted image for the background so the files appear clearly on top of 
the image as shown in Figure 12.27.
One disadvantage in using the On an Image layout is that there is no way to align the files when 
you drag them to the image. You have no grid and no alignment commands. You have to visually 
drag the files around the pane and eyeball them to fit in an organized view. Notice in Figure 12.28 
getting a precise alignment is near impossible.
 FIGURE 12.28
Files manually aligned on top of an image
Using the Sliding Row Layout
The last choice you have for a Basic Layout is the SlidingRow view. Click SlidingRow and you f
ind a view similar to the Revolve view available in the Animate panels. However, the SlidingRow 
appearance is a bit different. You see a thumbnail similar to the Basic Grid option along with the 
filename and description appearing in vertical images as shown in Figure 12.29. To the left and 
right sides of the Document pane are arrows used to navigate the files in the portfolio. Click these 
arrows to move back and forth to scroll through the files in the portfolio. Also notice at the bottom 
of the Document pane you see page icons. Place the cursor over a page icon and the filename 
appears as a tooltip. Clicking a page icon scrolls the view to the selected place in the Document 
pane foreground. To open a file in Preview mode, double-click the file in the Document pane. To 
return to the SlidingRow view from Preview mode, click the Home button.

Adding a Welcome Page
The layout you choose in the Choose a Layout panel displays your documents in a view you chose 
from the layout options. The Welcome page is much different than the layout view. The Welcome 
Page is shown first when the PDF Portfolio is opened in an Acrobat 9 viewer. This page has a simi-
lar behavior as the coversheet we used with Acrobat 8 and should not be confused with either the 
layout or the Headers & Footers designs. The Welcome Page is new to Acrobat 9 and appears 
when you first open a file like the coversheet opens in Acrobat 8 when using PDF Packages. 
Acrobat 9 does have a coversheet separate from the Welcome Page that can be viewed via a menu 
command or when opening a portfolio in Acrobat 7 and 8 viewers.
To add a Welcome Page, click Add Welcome & Header in the Edit Portfolio panel. You’ll see two 
options when the panel changes. The Welcome Page choice and the Header choice are both listed 
in this panel. Click Welcome Page and the Welcome Page options are displayed in the panel as 
shown in Figure 12.30.

 FIGURE 12.30
Click Add Welcome & Header and click Welcome Page and the panel changes to display several options 
for different Welcome Page design styles.
As shown in Figure 12.30, you have several choices for the design of a Welcome Page.
No Welcome Page
Selecting No Welcome Page in the Welcome Page panel does as you might expect — it adds nothing 
for a Welcome page. The end user jumps right into the view you decide to use for the layout. If a 
Welcome page is added to a PDF Portfolio, the user needs to click a button to view the contents of 
the PDF. If you want the users to first see the layout view, use this option for the Welcome page.
Text Only
As the name implies, you can add a block of text to display a message for your Welcome page as 
shown in Figure 12.31. Formatting the text for the text block is handled in a pop-up toolbar you 
see at the bottom of Figure 12.31.

you have for adding a Welcome page where text is part of the design. The individual choices you 
have by using the tools shown in Figure 12.32 include:

A. Font Family. Limited choices appear in the pull-down menu. You have only three choices 
here. Choose from Sans (sans serif font), Serif, and Typewriter. The Typewriter option 
uses the Courier font.
B. Font Size. Choose from preset font sizes from the pull-down menu ranging from 8 point 
to 72 point. You don’t have an option to use a custom size not offered among the presets.
C. Bold. By default, Bold type is turned on. Click this tool and the text is changed to Roman 
or normal.
D. Italic. Italicizes the text.
E. Underline. Underlines the text.
F. Text Color. Click this swatch and a color palette opens where you can specify a color for 
the text.
G. Align Left. Aligns text to left justified.
H. Align Center. Aligns text to center justified.
I. Align Right. Aligns text to right justified.
J. Background Color. Click the swatch and the pop-up color palette opens. Color changes 
you make are applied to the background color of the text box.
Note that when making changes to text, you can combine several styles in the same text box. Acrobat 
applies changes you make to only the selected text. Therefore, you could have a paragraph of text 
with the first word selected and apply a Bold style to the word. Select a sentence within the paragraph 
and you can apply an underline style to the selected text. The same applies to adding color values 
to text; only the selection is affected. In regard to justification, alignment is applied to all text within 
a paragraph. However, you can justify different paragraphs with different alignment options in the 
same text box.
Image Only
Use this option to add an image to your Welcome page. When you choose Image Only, a rectangle 
is shown with the text Add an image inside the rectangle. Click anywhere on the rectangle and the 
Browse for Image dialog box opens. Select a JPEG, GIF, or PNG image and click Open. The image 
is shown in the Document pane as you see in Figure 12.33.

Image & Text
This option is a combination of the Text Only and the Image Only welcome page designs. You can 
add both text and an image and resize the placeholders to position the two objects in any relation-
ship you want. In Figure 12.35 I placed the text block above the image.
 FIGURE 12.35
Text & Image combines the two welcome page options of Text Only and Image Only.
Flash Movie
The Flash Movie option provides you an opportunity to import Flash movies that are shown on the 
welcome page. Use this option to import an SWF Adobe Flash movie file. For more specific infor-
mation on using Adobe Flash files with PDF Portfolios, see the section “Using Adobe Flash with 
PDF Portfolios” later in this chapter.
Finishing up the welcome page
 
 After you create a welcome page, click the Done button and you end up in the Layout view. If you 
want to view the welcome page while in Layout view or List view, click the Open the Welcome 
Page tool in the portfolio toolbar.

Part III
To return to the Layout view, click the Done button again on the welcome page. When a user opens 
a PDF Portfolio, the button appearing on the welcome page is shown as Get Started. Clicking the 
Get Started button takes the user to the Layout view.
When viewing PDF Portfolios, users can dismiss the welcome page by clicking the Don’t show 
Welcome Page again check box. If you have essential information that you want a user to see when a 
portfolio is opened, place the information in a Header instead of the welcome page. Because users 
can dismiss the Welcome Page view, you’ll want to add nonessential information to this page.
Adding headers
Headers appear when you view PDF Portfolios on the opening welcome page and when viewing 
the individual files in one of the layout views. In other words, the header is always shown when 
viewing a portfolio.
To open the Header panel, click Add Welcome & Header in the Edit Portfolio panel. Again you’ll 
see two options — one for adding a welcome page and another for adding a header. Click Header 
and the panel changes to reflect the options you have for creating a header design as shown in 
Figure 12.36.
 FIGURE 12.36

No Header
The first choice is No Header. Click this option and you can eliminate a header from the portfolio.
Simple Text
The Simple Text option provides a text box where you can add text to a Header field. Adding text 
to any of the options where text is part of the header design opens the Text pop-up toolbar. The 
options you have for setting font styles and attributes are the same as when adding text to welcome 
pages. See the section “Adding a welcome page” earlier in this chapter.
When you add any one of the header designs to a portfolio, you perform edits in either the Welcome 
Page view or the Layout View. You can toggle this view by choosing the layout you use and view the 
PDFs in your file along with the new header. In Figure 12.37 my header is edited in the SlidingRow 
layout view.
 FIGURE 12.37
The Simple Text header provides a text box where you type text for the header design.
Structured Text
The Structured Text design adds some fields to the Simple Text options. You have the addition of 
Contact Info Text, Email Address Text, and the URL Text fields. Fill in these fields and you see a 
view similar to Figure 12.38.

The Email Address Text field and the URL Text field are both hot links in the PDF Portfolio. A user 
who views your portfolio can click the links to open a new message in the user’s default e-mail client, 
or click the URL text to open the user’s default Web browser that links to the URL address specified 
in this field.
Logo & Text
Logo & Text is a design where you can import an image adjacent to a text field. In Figure 12.39 I 
added a logo to the Logo & Text design. Notice that the image controls you have are identical to 
those controls you have when adding images to a welcome pages (see “Adding a welcome page” 
earlier in this chapter).
Logo & Structured Text
This option is a combination of using a logo with the Structured Text design. In Figure 12.40 you 
can see an example of a header using the Logo & Structured Text design.
Image Only
This option is the same as using Image Only in welcome pages. The difference is the default size of 
the image placeholder. The default size is the same as you see in Figure 12.40. However, you can 
size the placeholder to the same size as the welcome page Image Only placeholder.

Adding a new column
Under the Columns to Display text you find a text box (Add a column) as shown in Figure 12.43. 
Typing a name in the text box and clicking the plus icon enables you to add a new column that 
appears in List View when you check the check box adjacent to the column name in the panel. You 
might want to add a column of numbers to sort your files in an order that you want to have the 
files seen in Layout view by those who review your portfolio.
 FIGURE 12.43
New columns are created by first typing a name in the Add a column text box.
To add a new column and sort using that column, follow these steps:
Steps: Adding new columns to display
 
1. Open a PDF Portfolio.
 
2. Select Modify ➪ Edit Portfolio. Selecting this command takes you into Edit mode.
 
3. Open Specify File Details panel. Click Specify File Details in the Edit Portfolio panel; 
the Specify File Details panel opens.
 
4. Type a name for a new column. In my example, I want to sort files according to an 
order I want to see in the Layout view that is different from the default order displayed 
when I open the portfolio. The name I use for my new column is Order. Type the name 
in the text box.
NOTE
NOTE
When you add files to a PDF Portfolio, the List view and Layout view displays files in 
an alphabetical ascending order.
 
5. Assign a definition for the new column. Adjacent to the text box where you type a 
name for the new column, a pull-down menu offers three options. The options include 
Text, Number, and Date. In my example I want to use number. Select one of the three 
options from the menu.
 
6. Add the Column. Click the plus symbol adjacent to the pull-down menu to add the item 
as a new column.
 
7. Edit the column properties. Again, in my example, I want to sort my files in an order I 
define using my new Order column. In the List view I type numbers for the order in which 
I want my files sorted.
 
8. Sort the column. Open the Initial Sort pull-down menu and choose the new column you 
added. The result of my new order is shown in Figure 12.44.

A new column is added, the properties are edited, and the column is sorted in ascending order.
After a new column is added, you can change the column name by double-clicking the item in the 
list. After double-clicking, type a new name and press Enter. Note that the default items for Name, 
Description, Modified, Size, Compressed Size, and Created cannot be modified.
Managing details
 
 At the bottom of the list of detail items you find three icons. The Up and Down arrows are used to 
reorder the list. Changes you make in the list are reflected in the List view. For example, by default 
the Modified item follows the Description item, and the Created item appears last in the default 
display. If you want to move Created above Modified, click Created in the list in the panel and 
click the Up arrow. Keep clicking until the item is moved to the desired location. When you view 
the List view, you see the changes appearing in the column headings (that is, the Created column 
appears before the Modified column).
 
 The Trash icon is used to delete items. However, the default items shown in Figure 12.43 cannot 
be deleted. You use the Trash icon to delete new columns you add to the panel. For example, if I 
want to delete the Order column created in the preceding steps, I would click Order in the panel 
and click the Trash icon to delete the item. In this example, if I delete the column, the sort order is 
unaffected.

Managing the List view
Items are displayed in List view in columns according to the items checked in the panel. You can 
remove or add check marks to all items in the panel list. If you remove all check marks, the List 
view displays an icon representing the page thumbnail of a PDF page or an application icon for 
non-PDF file types.
You can resize the columns in List view much like you would resize cells in a spreadsheet applica-
tion. Move the cursor to the top row where you see the column header names and click the vertical 
separator bar. Drag the cursor left or right to resize the columns.
A file in List view can be opened by double-clicking the image icon in the first column. If the file is 
a PDF document, the file opens in the Preview mode. If the file is a non-PDF document, the Preview 
mode displays an application icon for the file. You can click the Open button to open the file in the 
original authoring application.
Using Adobe Flash with PDF Portfolios
Adobe Flash Player runtime is embedded in Acrobat and Adobe Reader 9. It stands to reason then 
that you should have several different options for handling Flash files in PDF Portfolios — and you 
do. Adobe Flash is to PDF Portfolios like hot links are to Web browsing. Although not completely 
essential, adding Flash to a portfolio makes your presentations much more dynamic.

Adding Flash files to the welcome page
Adobe Flash files are good candidates for welcome pages. Much like you might visit a Web site, you 
open the Home page and view a Flash movie that might be a short clip about your company. This 
information is nonessential relative to the contents of the portfolio. Like Web page designs, the user 
has the option to skip the intro each time the portfolio is opened by clicking the Don’t show Welcome 
Page again check box that automatically appears on all welcome pages.
To add a welcome page to a PDF Portfolio you should create the Adobe Flash FLV file and save as 
an SWF Flash file. Once you have the SWF animation you follow steps like the following:
Steps: Using a Flash movie for a welcome page
 
1. Create a new PDF Portfolio. Choose File ➪ Create PDF Portfolio or use one of the other 
menu choices you have for creating a new PDF Portfolio.
 
2. Click Add Welcome & Header in the Edit Portfolio panel. Choose Welcome Page 
from the two options listed in the Edit Portfolio panel.
 
3. Click Flash Movie. In the Welcome Page list of options, click Flash Movie; the Document 
pane changes to display a hot link for importing a Flash file. The text reads as Add a

Locate the SWF file on your hard drive, click it, and click Open.
 
5. Edit the Flash File attributes. After importing the file, the Flash File toolbar opens in 
the PDF Portfolio interface as shown in Figure 12.45. Click the Background Color swatch 
to change the background color of the welcome page if desired. Move the Scale slider to 
scale the movie file to the desired size. If you want to add transparency, move the Opacity 
slider.
 
6. Click Done. Click Done and the Flash application (or file) is set to play when the portfo-
lio is opened. From here you can click the Add Files or Add Existing Folder tools to 
import documents into your portfolio.

Importing Adobe Flash in a portfolio
You can import both Flash FLA native files and SWF movie files. Click Add Files and browse your 
hard drive to locate either file type. Select the file(s) and click Open. When a user views your port-
folio, the SWF files play in the portfolio. The Flash FLA files require the user to have Adobe Flash 
installed on their computer.
Converting Flash files to PDF
Adobe Flash FLV (Flash Video Files) can be converted directly to PDF. When you convert a Flash 
FLV file to PDF, the file page size is equal to the movie page size. You can use the Create ➪ PDF 
From File command prior to assembling your portfolio. You can also convert a Flash file to PDF 
after importing the file in a portfolio.
If you import a Flash file in a portfolio and want to convert to PDF, first select the file in the port-
folio in Edit mode. Open the Modify pull-down menu and choose Convert to PDF. Acrobat opens 
the Convert to PDF dialog box and a progress bar reports the status of the conversion as shown in 
Figure 12.46.
 FIGURE 12.46
A progress bar reports the status of converting an Adobe Flash FLV file to PDF.
The file is converted to a PDF document and added to the portfolio. The original FLV document 
remains in the portfolio and the new flash PDF document is added to the portfolio as shown in 
Figure 12.47. If you want to delete the original FLV file after conversion, select the file and open a 
context menu, or open the Modify pull-down menu and choose Delete from either menu.
If you use Flash SWF files you can import them directly in Acrobat without a need for converting 
the file.

Adding 3D content to a portfolio (Acrobat Pro Extended)
Although not Flash content, I tossed in 3D animation in this section. If you have Adobe Acrobat Pro 
Extended, you can convert a variety of native 3D application files to PDF from within a portfolio.
Any Acrobat Pro user can add a native file to a portfolio. However, the native documents require all 
users viewing your portfolio to have available the original authoring program in order to see the 
file. If you send 3D files to users who may have the original authoring application and some users 
who don’t have it, you may want to add two files to your portfolio.
You can convert a 3D file format supported by Acrobat Pro Extended from within a portfolio. Add 
the original file to a portfolio and select the file in Edit mode. From a context menu or the Modify 
menu choose Convert to PDF. The Acrobat 3D Conversion dialog box shown in Figure 12.48 opens.
Set the file conversion attributes and click OK. A progress bar is shown similar to the one shown in 
Figure 12.46. After the conversion is completed, the new PDF document is added to the portfolio. 
Again, the original file remains in the portfolio while the new PDF document is added. In Figure

cent to the original file.

If you know ahead of time what pages you want to include in a PDF Portfolio from not only PDF 
documents, but also many native files, you have some alternatives available to you.
Using the Combine Files wizard
Earlier in this chapter in the section “Using the Combine Files wizard” I talked about combining files 
into a single PDF document. Because the Combine Files and PDF Portfolio commands are segre-
gated and appear very distinct, you might think that these commands are limited exclusively to 
either combining files into a single PDF or creating a PDF Portfolio.
Using commands for creating a PDF Portfolio are indeed restricted to creating portfolios. However, 
the Combine Files wizard is not restricted to combining files into a single PDF. You can also use the 
wizard to create a PDF Portfolio.
When you use the Add Files tool, you don’t have an option to select individual pages to add to your 
portfolio. However, if you use the Combine Files wizard, you can selectively choose pages from all 
files that offer options for choosing pages in the wizard. After choosing pages, you can select the 
PDF Portfolio radio button and create a PDF Portfolio containing documents with just the pages 
you want to add to the portfolio.
To selectively choose pages in documents that are added to a PDF Portfolio, follow these steps:
Steps: Choosing pages in files added to a PDF Portfolio
 
1. Select File ➪ Combine ➪ Merge Files into a single PDF. Notice this command doesn’t 
provide a clue that you’re about to create a PDF Portfolio.
 
2. Add Files. The Combine Files dialog box opens. Open the Add Files pull-down menu 
and choose Add Files. The Add Files dialog box opens. Select files and click Add Files 
to add files to the Combine Files list.
 
3. Select Pages. Select a file in the list and click the Choose Pages (or Sheets, Slides, and so 
on, for the file type). In the Preview and Select Page Range dialog box, select the pages 
you want to use in the portfolio and click OK (see Figure 12.50).
 
4. Convert files to PDF. Click the Options button to open the Options dialog box shown 
earlier in Figure 12.12. Check the Convert all files to PDF when creating a portfolio 
check box and click OK.
 
5. Choose PDF Portfolio in the Combine Files dialog box. By default the Single PDF 
radio button is enabled. Click PDF Portfolio as shown in Figure 12.51.

7. Save the file. Click the Save button in the Save As dialog box. The files are assembled in 
a PDF Portfolio with the pages you chose in the Preview and Select Page Range dialog box.
Extracting pages from PDF files
You may have PDF documents that you want to add to a PDF Portfolio, but you only want selected 
pages to be part of the PDF Portfolio. If you prepare files ahead of time rather than use the Combine 
Files wizard, you can easily extract selected pages from a PDF file and later add the new PDF to a 
portfolio.
To add selected files to a new PDF document, follow these steps:
Steps: Extracting selected pages to a new PDF document
 
1. Open a PDF document in Acrobat.
 
2. Minimize the window so you can see part of the desktop background. Click the 
Minimize tool in the upper right corner of the Acrobat window (middle tool shown 
in Figure 12.52). Drag the lower-right corner to resize the Acrobat window.
 
3. Open the Pages panel. Click the Pages panel icon to open the panel.
 
4. Select pages you want to extract. In the Pages panel click a page and press the Ctrl/Ô 
key and click additional pages for a noncontiguous selection. To select a range of pages,

Publishing PDF Portfolios
Adobe’s focus for Acrobat 9 is to make Acrobat and PDF file sharing more engaging for end users. 
Acrobat 9 is the pinnacle of Adobe’s longtime pursuit to help users in this regard. In Acrobat 7, Adobe 
offered tools and methods to help people share files for commenting and review. In Acrobat 8 
Adobe provided more simplified sharing methods for comment and review and introduced Acrobat 
Connect for hosting and participating in online meetings. In Acrobat 9, Adobe brings to Acrobat users 
a newer, easier, and free sharing service.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
One of the best new features you’ll find in Acrobat 9 is the support for the new 
Acrobat.com service. Acrobat.com is a separate service provided by Adobe and 
Acrobat 9 makes it easy to use the resources you have available on Acrobat.com. Acrobat.com 
is a free service that permits users to share files, engage in review sessions, manage form data, 
and track files.

Sharing files on Acrobat.com
Although I cover using Acrobat.com in much more detail in Chapter 29, I’ll offer a brief introduc-
tion in this chapter for using Acrobat.com when working with PDF Portfolios. For a simple over-
view, follow these steps to send a portfolio to Acrobat.com and invite your colleagues to review the 
document.
Steps: Publishing PDF Portfolios on Acrobat.com
 
1. Open a PDF Portfolio in Acrobat.
 
2. Open the Share tool in the PDF Portfolio interface and choose Share Portfolio on 
Acrobat.com. The Share Documents on Acrobat.com dialog box opens.
 
3. Fill in your Adobe ID log-on information. If you have an Adobe ID, type your e-mail 
address and password in the Share Documents on Acrobat.com dialog box shown in 
Figure 12.53. If you don’t have an Adobe ID, click Create Adobe ID. An e-mail is sent 
back to you asking you to click a link to complete the process for creating an Adobe ID. 
When you receive your ID confirmation, type your e-mail address and password in the 
Share Documents on Acrobat.com dialog box and click Sign In.

4. Click Next in the Share Documents on Acrobat.com. After you log on to Acrobat.com, 
the Share Documents on Acrobat.com wizard opens. The default file selected for upload-
ing is the PDF Portfolio in view in Acrobat. You can change the file in the wizard to 
another file or add additional files. To submit the current file, click the Next button and 
an Email wizard opens as shown in Figure 12.54.
 FIGURE 12.54
Fill in the To text box with e-mail addresses of the people you want to share your port-
folio with.
 
5. Fill in the text boxes in the Email wizard. Fill in the To field with email addresses for 
your recipients. A default subject and message appear in the wizard window. For the Access 
Level choose either Open Access or Limited Access. If you choose Open Access anyone 
visiting your Acrobat.com library can download the file. Limited Access limits the access 
to only those you invite to view the document.
 
6. Click Send. The file begins an upload and a progress bar appears showing you the upload 
progress. Wait for the upload to complete and a dialog box confirms the upload.
 
7. Click View your document now. Click the text link in the confirmation dialog box and 
you arrive at Acrobat.com.
 
8. Log on to Acrobat.com. When you arrive at Acrobat.com you need to log on again. Type 
your Adobe ID and password to log on as shown in Figure 12.55.

9. Click My Files. Click the My Files button after logging on to Acrobat.com to open your 
Acroabt.com library as shown in Figure 12.56. From here you can invite additional view-
ers as we explain in Chapter 29.
There’s much more to using Acrobat.com than what’s covered here. For a more detailed descrip-
tion of the options you have available on Acrobat.com, be sure to read Chapter 29.
Sharing files via e-mail
E-mailing a PDF Portfolio might be an option for you. It’s best to use Acrobat.com for file exchanges 
especially when you have large files you want to share with other users. However, there may be 
times when you want to fire off a quick e-mail to a recipient when working with a smaller file.
To share a PDF Portfolio with other users, open the portfolio and open the Share pull-down menu. 
Choose Email from the menu options. A new message window opens in your default e-mail client 
as shown in Figure 12.57. Note that the new message automatically contains a file attachment. Fill 
in the To, Subject, and Message fields and click Send to send the mail.

Navigating PDF Portfolios
What I’ve covered up to this point is creating and editing PDF Portfolios. As a recipient of a portfo-
lio or to help guide others in viewing your portfolio content, you’ll need to become familiar with 
PDF Portfolio navigation and viewing.
Using the Layout view
When you open a PDF Portfolio, the first page you see is the welcome page if the PDF author added 
one to the portfolio. If no welcome page exists in the Portfolio, you see the default Layout view the 
PDF author assigned to the portfolio. In Figure 12.58 the Layout view is the Revolve design. There’s 
also a header in this file as you can see in Figure 12.58.
Scrolling pages in this view and other Layout view designs is a matter of clicking navigational buttons 
and document previews. In the Revolve design, click the arrow icons on either side of the window 
to scroll through the different documents in the portfolio. Additionally, you can click the page icons 
at the bottom of the window. Use these icons to jump to different files in a noncontiguous order.
Although the different Layout views appear with varying design elements, navigation is very intui-
tive when viewing portfolios in the Layout views. The best way to become familiar with navigating 
different layouts is to poke around and explore different designs.
 FIGURE 12.58

Previewing files
Each file contained within a portfolio can be shown in a separate preview window. If you have PDF 
files as part of your portfolio, you can open them in Acrobat and view the files just like you view 
other PDF documents. If the files are native authoring application documents, the Preview displays 
an Open button to use to open the file in the native application.
 
 You open a file in Preview mode in several ways. You can double-click the file in the Layout view, 
or you can click the Preview tool in the PDF Portfolio toolbar. Another method you can use is to 
select a menu command that I discuss later in the section “Using portfolio menu commands.”
Click the Preview tool to see the selected document in Preview mode as shown in Figure 12.59. 
This view is still the view within the PDF Portfolio. From this view you can open a PDF document 
from Preview mode by clicking the Open button appearing in the top right corner of the window. 
If you want to edit a PDF document, you might click the Open button and open the PDF in the 
Normal viewer mode, where you have access to all the Acrobat tools and all the menu commands.
 FIGURE 12.59

If you want to simply browse a PDF document, you can stay in the PDF Portfolio Preview mode. 
Notice in Figure 12.59 you have access to Navigation panel buttons. You can view bookmarks, 
digital signatures, comments, and file attachments, and you can access other navigation panels 
by opening a context menu on the Navigation panel and choosing a panel you want to open.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on using Navigation panels, see Chapter 5.
You also have navigational tools to view other documents in the Preview mode. I cover these options 
later in the section “Navigating documents in Preview mode.”
Open the Tools menu while in Preview mode to access some of Acrobat’s tools. From the Tools menu 
you can open the Comment & Markup toolbar, the Analysis toolbar, and the Multimedia toolbar. 
Not all toolbars are accessible, but you can open the More Tools window by selecting Tools ➪ 
Customize Toolbars and load the tools that are supported in this viewer mode.
Note that inasmuch as the Advanced toolbar is not accessible in Preview mode, you can use a key-
board shortcut to access the Select Object tool by pressing the R key on your keyboard. Individual 
tools are available using keyboard shortcuts as long as the Use single-key accelerators to access 
tools check box is enabled in the General Preferences.
TIP
TIP
Preferences are accessible in any view in PDF Portfolios. Press Ctrl/Ô+K to open the 
Preferences dialog box.
Returning to default views
One thing that’s critically important to know is how to return to the default view when you open 
a PDF Portfolio. By default you start with the welcome page and then enter the Layout view. As 
you become familiar with navigating files in portfolios, this view will be commonplace to you, 
and you’ll frequently want to return to the view when you branch out and explore other views 
such as the Preview mode or Normal viewer mode in Acrobat.
 
 Just remember to always click the Home tool in the PDF Portfolio toolbar. Clicking this tool opens 
the last view you had in the Layout view. Also, remember that the Home view doesn’t show you the 
welcome page. It only takes you to the Layout view.
 
 If you want to open the welcome page, you can click the Open Welcome Page tool in the PDF 
Portfolio toolbar.
Using the List view
I covered using the List view earlier in this chapter in the section “Working with File Details.” 
Review that section to learn more about the List view.
 
 To enter the List view, click the List View tool in the PDF Portfolio toolbar. When you enter the 
List view, you can double-click a file icon in the far left column to enter Preview mode. Note that 
you don’t have context menu commands for navigation or any other operation while in the List view.

Navigating documents in Preview mode
When you enter Preview mode, the PDF Portfolio tools change to offer you navigation options while 
remaining in Preview mode. You can open files in the PDF Portfolio without exiting the Preview 
mode.
Tools you find in the Preview mode toolbar shown in Figure 12.60 include:

A. Preview the previous file. Opens the previous file in the Preview mode. When in Layout 
view, the order you see the files listed is the same order you navigate in the Preview mode. 
Clicking this button is the same as clicking the left arrow in the Layout views but the file 
remains in Preview mode.
B. Preview the next file. Opposite of item A above. This tool takes you to the next file in 
the list order.
C. Previous Page. This tool is confined to the document in view. If viewing a PDF file, click

Using Portfolio menu commands
Another method available to you for navigating PDF Portfolios is found in the View menu. When 
you open a portfolio in an Acrobat viewer, a new menu command with a submenu is added to the 
View menu. Choose View ➪ Portfolio and the submenu commands appear as shown in Figure 12.61.
 FIGURE 12.61
When you open a PDF Portfolio in an Acrobat viewer, the Portfolio menu item is added to the View menu.
The first four items (Home, Details, Preview File, and Welcome Page) all have counterparts with the 
PDF Portfolio tools discussed throughout this chapter. The last command in the submenu shows 
you a cover sheet. Choose View ➪ Portfolio ➪ Cover Sheet and the cover sheet appears as shown in 
Figure 12.62.
If you share your files with users of Acrobat 9, they won’t see the embedded cover sheet that is 
present in all PDF Portfolios. The cover sheet shows up when users of Acrobat prior to version 9 
open your portfolios. The cover sheet also appears as a thumbnail image when uploading files to 
Acrobat.com.
You can change the cover sheet by creating your own design and saving to the appropriate folder 
inside your Acrobat folder. However, I don’t recommend you mess with this page. In Acrobat 8 we 
used cover sheets to display the first page in an Acrobat PDF Package, and customizing the default 
Adobe cover sheet was a handy option for you. You could create your own custom designs and 
have the pages appear as the default view in a PDF Package.
However, in Acrobat 9, you upload files to Acrobat.com and users immediately notice the familiar 
cover sheet icon and realize immediately that you have a PDF Portfolio up for review. If you change 
the cover sheet image, you take away the immediate recognition by other users that the file is a PDF 
Portfolio. Furthermore, Acrobat 9 PDF Portfolios offer you many impressive options for creating a 
welcome page. You have control over the opening view of your portfolios and won’t need to bother 
with a document that is rarely seen by users of Acrobat 9 viewers.

 FIGURE 12.62
Choose View ➪ Portfolio ➪ Cover Sheet to open the cover sheet page.
In the File menu you’ll find some more menu commands related to PDF Portfolios. In the File menu 
the commands you find other than the PDF Portfolio creation commands include:
 Save Portfolio. Use this command to update a portfolio while you make edits. This com-
mand is the same as pressing Ctrl/Ô+S.
 Save Portfolio As. This command is the same as using a Save As command but the save 
is made for the entire portfolio. Use this command to overwrite a PDF Portfolio and opti-
mize it.
 Save File From Portfolio. When you view a document in Preview mode and choose this 
command, you save the currently viewed file. The file can be any file type.
 Attach Portfolio to Email. Use this command to attach the portfolio in view to a new 
e-mail message in your default e-mail client.
 Portfolio Properties. Choose this command to open the Document Properties dialog 
box. You can add a Document Description and Security, edit the Initial View, and add 
Custom property metadata to the file. Note that each PDF document contained in a port-
folio can contain its own individual document properties. When you use this command, 
it applies to the portfolio.

Adding navigation buttons to PDFs in a portfolio
As a general rule, PDF Portfolios have an impressive interface and intuitive design for navigating 
the contents of a portfolio. If you plan your work with user navigation and easy viewing in mind, 
you shouldn’t have much need for navigational buttons. However, as is the case in all aspects of 
document viewing in the computer world, there are exceptions.
You might have a well-organized portfolio but an occasional need for a user to branch out to a page 
in another document to follow a concept, and then return to the document in view after reviewing 
supplemental information. Perhaps something on the order of a point stressed in an annual report 
with a link to a financial statement would be one example of a case where you want the user to 
easily link to another view. Another example might be a cover letter that mentions a newspaper 
article interview where you want the viewer to jump to the article, look it over, and return to the 
cover letter. If you want this type of navigational control, you may want to add a button with an 
action assigned to the button to open other pages in other PDF files to help your viewers branch 
out and review supporting documentation on a given concept.
Keep in mind that although you can link to documents other than PDF, the end user needs origi-
nal authoring programs and there is a delay in viewing supplement documents while a program 
launches. The type of navigation control presented here works best if you limit the navigational 
links to PDF files.
To understand more clearly the task of creating navigation buttons in PDF Portfolios, follow these 
steps:
Steps: Creating navigation links in PDF Portfolios
 
1. Open a PDF Portfolio containing several PDF files and at least one file having more 
than one page.
 
2. Open the page you want to link from in Preview mode. Select a page in the Layout 
view and double-click the page or click the Preview tool in the PDF Portfolio toolbar.
 
3. Select the Link tool. Select Tools ➪ Advanced Editing ➪ Link Tool. The cursor loads the 
Link tool.
 
4. Add a Link to the document page. Move the cursor to the location you want to add a 
link and open a rectangle on the page for the Link.
 
5. Set the Link Properties. Choose either Visible Rectangle or Invisible Rectangle from the 
Link Type pull-down menu. Chose options for Line Style, Highlight Style, and Line 
Thickness if you want the rectangle visible as shown in Figure 12.63.
 
6. Add the Action. Leave the default Link Action at the Go to a page view radio button 
choice and click Next. The Create Go to View dialog box opens as shown in Figure 12.64.

Click Next to open the Create Go to View dialog box.
 
7. Navigate to the target view. Be certain to keep the Create Go to View dialog box open. 
You have full navigation control in the PDF Portfolio while this dialog box remains open. 
Click the Preview the previous file or Preview the next file arrows in the Portfolio toolbar 
to navigate documents until you locate the target document. When the document is in 
view, open the page you want to link to as shown in Figure 12.65.

438

8. Set the link. Click Set Link in the Create Go to View dialog box. Once you set the link, 
you are returned to the document where the navigation link resides. At this point you can 
follow the same steps to create another link on the target page to return to the page with 
the original link.

For more information on creating navigational links, see Chapter 22.
Working with File Attachments
File attachments enable you to attach any document file on your hard drive, a recorded sound, or a 
pasted image to an open PDF file. When you attach files, the file is embedded in the PDF document. 
Embedding a file provides other users the capability to view attachments on other computers and 
across platforms. At first it may appear as though the attachment is a link. However, if you transport 
the PDF document to another computer and open the attachment, the embedded file opens in the 
host application.

439
Combining, Packaging, and Attaching PDFs
12
Users on other computers need the original authoring application to view the embedded file just 
like files added to PDF Portfolios. You can add file attachments in Acrobat Standard, Pro, or Pro 
Extended.. You can also add file attachments in Adobe Reader when PDFs have been created by 
using Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES. If you open the Attachments panel (click the paper 
clip icon in the Navigation panel) in Adobe Reader, you cannot add file attachments if the file has 
not been enabled with Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES. An alternative for those without the 
LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES is to enable PDFs for Commenting in Adobe Reader using Acrobat 
Pro or Pro Extended. Reader users can then add file attachments as comments.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
Enabling commenting in Adobe Reader is available in Acrobat, Pro, and Pro 
Extended in Acrobat 9. For more information on enabling files with Adobe Reader 
extensions, see Chapter 19.
There are two methods available to you when attaching files. You can use the Commenting toolbar 
and attach a file as a comment, or use the Attach a File menu command from the Document menu 
or Attachments panel. When files are attached using Attach a File as a Comment, the PDF needs to 
be enabled with usage rights for Adobe Reader users to extract the file. Additionally, when Attach a 
File as a Comment is used, the file attachments show up in any comment summary you create in 
Acrobat. Additionally, you can add file attachments to PDF Portfolios as well as PDF documents.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
The commenting tools used for file attachments are discussed in this chapter. 
However, commenting is a huge topic and you’ll find Chapter 20 devoted to all the 
other features all Acrobat viewers offer you for commenting.
When using the Attach a File menu command, any Adobe Reader user in version 7.0 and later can 
extract the file attachment without the file enabled with usage rights. Unlike using commenting 
tools, files attached using the menu command do not show up in comment summaries.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on adding usage rights to PDFs for Adobe Reader, see 
Chapter 19.
Regardless of what attachment you add to a document, the attachments appear in the Attachments 
panel in the Navigation pane. If you add a file attachment to a PDF in a PDF Portfolio, the portfolio 
attachments are shown in the Attachments panel when you open the Navigation pane.
Using the Attach tools
 
 To attach a file to a PDF document, select Document ➪ Attach a File. The Add Attachment dialog 
box opens where you can navigate your hard drive, locate a file to attach, select the file, and click 
Open. The file is attached to the open document, and all users of all Acrobat viewers version 7.0 
and later can extract the attachment.
To use the Attach a File as a Comment tool, select the tool and click in the Document pane. The Add 
Attachment dialog box opens, in which you navigate to a file and select it for the attachment. Any 
file on your computer can be used as a file attachment. Select a file and click Select. The File Attachment 
Properties dialog box opens with the Appearance tab in view as shown in Figure 12.66.

chapter for loading the tools necessary to follow along in this section.
The Appearance properties for file attachments offer you choices for icon appearances to represent 
file attachments. Choose from one of the four icon choices shown in Figure 12.66. By default the 
Paperclip icon is used.
The General tab shown in Figure 12.67 has editable fields used for Author name, Subject, and a 
Description. By default, the Author name is supplied by your Identity preferences.

NOTE
NOTE
You must have the original authoring application to open file attachments when the 
attachments are other than PDF.
You can use PDF documents like a security wrapper for any file you want to exchange with col-
leagues and co-workers. Use the Attach a File as a Comment tool and attach one or more files to a 
PDF document. Secure the PDF with Password Security and use the E-mail tool to send the file to 
members of your workgroup. You can protect the document with password security and prevent 
unauthorized users from opening your PDF or extracting attached files. In this regard you can use 
Acrobat to secure any document you create in any authoring program. Of course, you can also 
secure PDF Portfolios and use files within a portfolio very similar to using file attachments.

File attachments are embedded in PDFs, and double-clicking the Attach a File as a Comment icon 
provides you access to the file. If you want to save an embedded file to disk without opening the 
file, open a context menu and select Save Attachment. Acrobat opens a dialog box where you can 
navigate your hard drive and designate a location for the file to be saved to. Neither opening a file 
nor saving the attachment file to disk removes the file attachment. If you want to delete a file attach-
ment, open a context menu on the attachment icon and select Delete Attachment or select the icon 
and press Delete or the Del key.
Record Audio Comment tool
Sound comments are recorded from within the PDF document or from prerecorded sounds saved 
in WAV or AIFF format on both Windows and Macintosh. For recording a sound, you must have 
a microphone connected to your computer. The resulting sound file is embedded in the PDF when 
you use the Record Audio Comment tool.
Attaching prerecorded sounds
Select the Record Audio Comment tool and click on a PDF page. The Sound Recorder (Windows 
shown in Figure 12.69) or Record Sound (Macintosh shown in Figure 12.70) dialog box opens. 
Click Browse (Windows) or Choose (Macintosh).

Navigate your hard drive and find a sound file to attach to the document. Select the sound file and 
click the Select button. Acrobat returns you to the Sound Recorder (Windows) or Record Sound 
(Macintosh) dialog box. At this point you can play the sound or click OK to embed the sound in the 
PDF. Click the right-pointing arrow (Windows) or Play (Macintosh) and you can verify the sound 
before importing it. After you click OK, the Sound Attachment Properties dialog box opens.

Recording sounds
Click the mouse button with the Record Audio Comment tool to open the Sound Recorder 
(Windows) or Record Sound (Macintosh) dialog box. Click the record button and speak into 
the microphone connected to your computer. When you finish recording the sound, click OK 
(Windows) or Stop (Macintosh). The Sound Attachment Properties dialog box opens immediately 
after you stop the recording. The General properties are shown in Figure 12.71.

After you stop a recording, the Sound Attachment Properties dialog box opens (Windows).
When you close the Sound Attachment Properties dialog box, the sound can be played like 
imported sounds. Open a context menu and select Play File (or double-click the Record Audio

across platforms without having to include a sound file link. All sound files are audible on either 
platform once imported into PDFs.

Attachments and PDF Portfolios
You might first think that file attachments are unnecessary when you create PDF Portfolios. After 
all, you can add any file to a PDF Portfolio, so why use a file attachment to add files to your docu-
ment? Perhaps the primary reason for adding file attachments is when you want to share files with 
Adobe reader 7 or 8 users.

444
Editing PDFs
Part III
TIP
TIP
As an alternative to using file attachments you can create a new folder in a PDF 
Portfolio and store all your original authoring application documents in a folder. 
This method is preferred if you share files with users of Acrobat 9 viewers.
Creative pros and engineers might make use of PDF Portfolios and file attachments. You might have 
several brochures or similar documents created in Adobe InDesign that you want to share with your 
workgroup. You can create a package from InDesign that saves your InDesign document, fonts, 
and images to a package file. You can then use the Attach a File command to attach the InDesign 
package files to the PDF versions of the documents. Similar kinds of workflows might be used with 
engineers creating technical drawings or mechanical engineers creating 3D images.
TIP
TIP
Because of potential virus problems ZIP and EXE files are not recommended for use 
as file attachments. You can, however, attach Stuffit archives that can be extracted 
on both Windows and the Macintosh.
Another instance where a file attachment in a PDF Portfolio might be helpful is when adding 
audio comments. PDF Portfolios don’t support audio comments quite like using the Record Audio 
Comment tool. If you prefer adding notes in audio form to PDF documents, using a recorded 
audio attachment might just be your solution.
If you ever find a need for adding file attachments to PDF Portfolios, there are a few things you 
should know about the structure of a PDF Package and attachments:
 Attachments, as well as comments, are attached to each file independently. In order to 
see an attachment either on a document page or in the Attachments panel, you need 
to place the respective PDF in view in the portfolio Preview mode. Attachments made to 
files not in view are not shown in the Attachments panel. It’s like having a separate 
Attachments panel for each PDF in a package.
 File attachments can be searched in a PDF Portfolio. If you have attachments made to dif-
ferent PDFs, you can search all attachment files, as well as all PDFs in a portfolio. When 
you use the Search panel in a PDF Portfolio, you must click Search Entire Portfolio to 
search file attachments.
 Comment summaries are made specific to each PDF document. You cannot combine file 
attachments as comments made on different PDFs in a portfolio to a single summary.

For more information on creating comment summaries, see Chapters 20 and 31.
 PDF Portfolios and file attachments are viewed in separate panes. When you double-click 
a file attachment, the file opens in Normal viewer mode, not within the portfolio interface.
Using the Attachments panel
The Attachments panel docked in the Navigation pane appears by default. If you don’t see the 
Attachments panel in a PDF Portfolio, open a context menu on the Navigation pane and choose 
Reset Panels. When you click the Attachments panel, the panel opens horizontally like the

Comments tab. The Attachments panel includes a list of file attachments contained in a document 
that were attached with either the Attach a File command or the Attach a File as a Comment tool.
File attachments can be added to PDF documents and PDF Portfolios. In Figure 12.72, a single 
file attachment was added to a PDF in a PDF Portfolio. The Attachments panel is opened and a file 
attachment on a page in the current document in the PDF Package is in view.
 FIGURE 12.72
Click the Attachments icon to open the Attachments panel where a list of all file attachments appear when 
added with either the Attach a File as a Comment tool or the Attach a File menu command.
At the top of the Attachments panel, you find tools for the following:
 
  Open. Click an attachment listed in the panel and click Open. The attachment opens in 
the program that created the document.
 
  Save. Select an attachment and click Save to save the file to disk. Attachments are contained 
within PDF files and not accessible to authoring programs unless you open the file by 
using the Open tool or double-click an attachment icon. Clicking the Save tool extracts 
the attachment and saves the extracted file to disk. (Note: Extraction does not delete the 
file attachment from the PDF.)

  Add. Add is the only tool accessible when an attachment is not selected in the panel. Click 
Add to open the Add Attachment dialog box where you can attach additional files. As 
new files are added as attachments, they are listed dynamically in the Attachment panel.
 
  Delete. Click an attachment and click the Delete tool to remove the attachment from the 
host document.
TIP
TIP
If you inadvertently delete an attachment, you can choose Edit ➪ Undo and bring 
the attachment back. If you delete several attachments, you can select Undo several 
times and bring back each deleted attachment.
 
  Search. Clicking the Search tool opens the Acrobat Search panel as shown in Figure 
12.73 — when viewing a PDF document. When searching attachments in PDF Portfolios, 
use the Search tool in the PDF Portfolio toolbar. If you view a file in a New Window view, 
you have access to the Search tool in the Attachments panel.
 FIGURE 12.73
Click Search in the Attachments panel and the Acrobat Search panel opens as a separate 
window.
 
You enter search criteria in the Search panel (or PDF Portfolio toolbar) and click the 
Search Attachments button (or click the binoculars icon). Your Acrobat viewer searches 
all attached PDF files attached to files in the PDF Portfolio.
 
If you choose Edit ➪ Search Entire Portfolio or press Ctrl/Ô+Shift+F, the search panel in 
the Portfolio opens as shown in Figure 12.74. Notice in Figure 12.74 you have options 
for searching for Whole Words, Case Sensitive, and Search Entire Portfolio. What doesn’t 
appear in the list is searching bookmarks and comments like you have available with 
Acrobat Search.

Summary
 Separate files can be merged together in a single PDF file using the Combine Files task 
button.
 A PDF Portfolio is created with either several different menu commands or by using the 
same Combine Files wizard.
 PDF Portfolios open in a separate user interface much different than the Normal viewer 
mode in Acrobat 9 and above viewers.
 PDF Portfolios can contain secure files and Adobe Designer XML forms. Creating a single 
PDF from multiple files does not support secure files or Designer forms.
 PDF Portfolios use a number of different user-selectable templates for the display the 
Home page and the Layout view.
 Headers added to a PDF Portfolio appear on all pages including the Home page.
 The PDF Portfolio toolbar contains tools to help you easily navigate the portfolio.
 Files can be sorted in the List view according to default document characteristics or 
through custom properties added as new columns.
 Adobe Flash files can be used for welcome pages in PDF Portfolios.
 Navigating PDF Portfolios can be handled in the Layout view, the Preview view, and in 
the List view.
 PDF Portfolios can be published on Acrobat.com.
 Navigation links (if you are in preview mode) can be added to a document in a PDF 
Portfolio to open pages in other documents in the same portfolio.
 File attachments can be added to PDFs and to files within PDF Portfolios.
 Attachments can be made as file attachment comments or using a menu command.
 If files are attached you can extract the attachments in Adobe Reader.
 If you attach files other than PDF, you need the original application program that created 
the document installed on your computer in order to open the attached file.
 File attachments are viewed according to the PDF file in the Attachments panel. When 
viewing file attachments made on PDFs in a PDF Portfolio, only the attachments on the 
current file in view can be seen in the Attachments panel.

deally you should always return to an original document when you want 
to make changes on PDF pages that were converted from an authoring 
application. With all of Acrobat’s impressive features, it is not designed 
to be used as a page layout program. The options you have in Acrobat for text 
editing are limited to tweaks and minor corrections. Inasmuch as Acrobat 9 
greatly improved text editing on PDFs, returning to your authoring program, 
editing the pages, and converting them back to PDF is a preferred method.
For minor edits and for purposes of editing PDF files where original documents 
have been lost or are unavailable, Acrobat does provide you tools and means 
for text editing. As you look through this chapter, realize that the pages 
ahead are intended to describe methods for minor corrections and text edit-
ing when you don’t have an option for returning to an original document.
Setting Up the Text Editing 
Environment
For text editing, there are several toolbars that you’ll want to make visible 
and dock in the Toolbar Well or float in the Document window, depending 
on what is handier for you. Toolbars you need for text editing include:
 Reset Toolbars. Open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and 
select Reset Toolbars to return the tools and toolbars to defaults.
 Access the tools. Open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and 
select More Tools.

TouchUp Object tool.
 File Toolbar. Add the Organizer and Search tools to the File Toolbar.
 Edit Toolbar. Check the box for the Edit Toolbar and all tools are added by default.
 Select & Zoom Toolbar. For zooming in and out of the Document pane, use the Loupe 
tool. Add the Actual Size, Fit Width, and Fit Page tools.
Click OK in the More Tools window. Open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and select Dock 
Toolbars. After loading the toolbars, your Toolbar Well should look like Figure 13.1.
 FIGURE 13.1
Load all editing tools in the Toolbar Well before beginning your text editing session.
Using the TouchUp Text Tool
 
 For minor text edits, the TouchUp Text tool on the Advanced Editing toolbar enables 
 you to edit text along single lines of copy and edit bodies of text. Before you attempt to 
change text passages on a PDF page, you need to keep a few things in mind. Some of the consider-
ations include:
 Font embedding. If you attempt to edit an embedded font, Acrobat prompts you in a 
dialog box to unembed the font. Text editing is only possible after a font is unembedded. 
Depending on the permissions granted by the font developer, some fonts can’t be unem-
bedded. If Acrobat informs you that font editing cannot occur, you need to make your 
changes in the original authoring document.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on font embedding, see Chapter 10.
 Tagged and untagged PDF documents. Selecting text with the TouchUp Text tool was 
problematic with earlier versions of Acrobat. Blocks of text in untagged files were inter-
preted as separate passages and could not be selected in a contiguous area. Acrobat now 
has a more intelligent interpretation of text on a page, and tagged as well as untagged files 
display no difference when selecting text. In Figure 13.2, a page of text is selected with 
the TouchUp Text tool in an untagged document.

451
Editing Text

 FIGURE 13.2
The TouchUp Text tool in Acrobat 9 can select multiple blocks of text in untagged PDF 
files.
 
The ability to select lines of text, a paragraph, or multiple paragraphs with the TouchUp 
Text tool is not dependent on whether a PDF is tagged or untagged; but rather, it’s 
dependent on the structure and content of a PDF. In some documents, you can’t select 
more than single lines of text like the file shown in Figure 13.3.
 FIGURE 13.3
The TouchUp Text tool can select only single lines of text on a page in some PDF 
documents.

For information on creating tagged PDF files, see Chapters 9 and 10.
 Property changes. You can apply property changes for fonts, such as color, size, and 
other attributes, to text without unembedding the font.
Fortunately, Acrobat alerts you ahead of time if you attempt to edit a PDF document with embedded 
fonts and those fonts aren’t installed on your computer. To edit fonts on a page, select the TouchUp 
Text tool, and click and drag over a body of text to be changed. Acrobat pauses momentarily as it 
surveys your installed fonts and the font embedded in the PDF document. Enter your changes and 
the selected text is replaced with the new text you typed.
You’ll be able to see onscreen whether your text editing results in an acceptable appearance and 
the edits are properly applied. If the text scrambles and you lose total control over the document 
page, you need to either find the original authoring document or export text from Acrobat into a 
word processor or layout program to make the changes.
PREPRESS
PREPRESS
Editing text passages are fine for screen displays when the text flows in an accept-
able manner. For high-end printing and prepress you might be able to successfully 
make changes and minor edits without experiencing printing problems. However, for any kind 
of paragraph editing you are best off returning to the authoring application. You might get away 
with some edits in Acrobat, but eventually they will catch up with you. If you do make a spelling 
error change or other minor text edit, be certain to re-embed the font (see “Changing text attri-
butes” later in this chapter).
In addition to selecting the Properties menu command, a context menu opened from a TouchUp 
Text tool selection offers menu commands for insertion of special characters. Four choices are 
available to you when you open a context menu and select the Insert menu command. From the 
submenu you can choose:
 Line Break. This choice adds a line break from the cursor insertion. This command is 
handy when creating new text on a page or when pasting text. Text lines may extend 
beyond the page width when creating new text or pasting text. You can create line breaks 
to keep text within a specific area of the page.
 Soft Hyphen. This choice adds a soft hyphen for text scrolling to a new line.
 Non-Breaking Space. To add spaces without line breaks, choose non-breaking space.
 Em Dash. To add an em dash (—) at the cursor insertion, choose em dash.
When text is selected and you insert a special character, the selected text is deleted and the new char-
acter is added. If you use special characters in some files, the results may be less than desirable. Line 
breaks can flow text into following paragraphs and the text can overlap, making the page unreadable. 
If you encounter such problems and the edits are necessary to make your files more readable, you 
must return the file to the authoring program, make the edits, and re-create the PDF document.

Changing text attributes
You can make many text attribute changes without unembedding fonts. You can change colors, 
point sizes in lines of text, character and word spacing, and other similar text attributes, as well as 
make changes related to the document structure. You make all of these changes in the TouchUp 
Properties dialog box.
To edit text properties, select the characters, words, or paragraph(s) you want to change. Be certain 
the text is highlighted and open a context menu, as shown in Figure 13.4. From the menu options, 
select Properties.
 FIGURE 13.4
To change text properties, select the text to be changed with the TouchUp Text tool and select Properties

Two tools enable text selection — the TouchUp Text tool and the Select tool. Always 
use the TouchUp Text tool context menu when opening the TouchUp Properties 
dialog box. The Select tool context menu does not provide access to the TouchUp Properties dia-
log box. For information related to using the Select tool, see “Using the Select Tool” later in this 
chapter.
After you select Properties from the context menu, the TouchUp Properties dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 13.5. The first two tabs relate to changing tags and document structure. Leave these 
alone for the moment and look at the third tab labeled Text. The properties contained on it relate 
to changing font attributes for the selected text.

For information on using the Content and Tag tabs, see Chapter 25.
Items contained in the Text tab include:
 Font. This pull-down menu contains a list of fonts for all the fonts loaded in your system 
and fonts embedded in the document. Keep in mind that just because a font is listed in 
the pull-down menu doesn’t mean you can select the font. If the font is an embedded/
subsetted font and you don’t have a compatible font loaded in your system, Acrobat won’t 
let you use that font. Fonts loaded in your system can be selected to replace fonts that are 
both embedded and not embedded.
NOTE
NOTE
The font list in the pull-down menu shows a line dividing the list at the top of the 
menu. All fonts appearing above the line are embedded fonts in the document. All 
fonts below the line are loaded in your system.
 Font Size. You select a preset font size from this pull-down menu. If the desired size is 
not listed among the menu choices, select the font size in the field box and type a new 
value to change the size.
 Character Spacing. You can move characters in a line of text closer together or farther 
apart. The values shown in the pull-down menu are measured in em spaces. Choose from 
the menu choices or type a value in the field box. Using negative (–) values moves the 
characters together.

455

 Word Spacing. This option controls the space between whole words. You make choices 
for distance the same way you do for the preceding Character Spacing option.
 Horizontal Scaling. Sizing of individual characters (narrower or wider) is set according 
to the percentage of the original size. Values above 100% scale characters larger than the 
original font. Values below 100% result in smaller characters.
 Embed. Check the box to embed the selected font.
 Subset. Check the box to subset the font.
CROSS-REF

For information on font embedding and subsetting, see Chapter 10.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
In order to legally embed a font, you must own a copy of the font to be embedded 
and comply with the licensing restrictions of the font manufacturer. Be certain to 
review the licensing agreement that came with your fonts to verify embedding the font(s) is per-
mitted. Some developers do not license fonts for embedding.
 Fill. The color swatch shows the default color of the selected font. Clicking the color 
swatch opens a pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 13.6. You select preset colors from 
the palette. When you click Other Color the system color palette opens. You can create 
custom colors from the system color palette and apply them to the text fill.
 FIGURE 13.6

If you intend to print your PDFs for color separations, don’t make color changes in 
Acrobat. Acrobat only supports RGB colors with no support for CMYK or spot col-
ors using the TouchUp Properties dialog box. If color changes to text are needed, you would be 
best off returning to the original authoring application and making the color changes, and then 
recreating the PDF file. For more information on RGB, Spot, and Process color, see Chapter 32.
 Stroke Width. You change the weight (in points) of stroke outlines (if a font has a 
stroke) by making choices in the pull-down menu or by typing values in the field box.

456

TIP
TIP
If you want to create outline text, select No color from the Fill Color pop-up menu 
and add a stroke color and width. When stroke fills are set to No color, the fills 
appear transparent and show the background color.
 Baseline Offset. You can raise or lower text above the baseline or below it. To move text up, 
enter positive values in the field box. To move text below the baseline, use negative values.
After making choices in the TouchUp Properties dialog box, click the Close button. The changes 
you make in the dialog box are reflected only on text you selected with the TouchUp Text tool.
Editing text on layers
You can edit text on layered PDF documents. When layer data are visible, you can use the TouchUp 
Text tool to select text and edit the properties as described in the section “Changing text attributes.” 
If you have difficulty selecting text, you can hide layers and select just the text on visible layers.
TIP
TIP
If selecting text or images is difficult because images interfere with text selections 
or vice versa, you can send the text and images to new layers. New in Acrobat 9 you 
find the Create PDF Layers options. Open the Print Production toolbar and click the Examine 
Document tool. In the Preflight dialog box, expand the Create PDF Layers group and choose 
Create separate layers for vector objects, text, and images. After editing the document you can 
flatten the layers by opening the Layers panel and choosing Flatten Layers from the Layers panel 
Option menu. (See Chapter 24 for more on working with layers.)
You can also select and edit text appearing on all visible layers. If text appears on all layers, the edits 
are applied to all layers. If text appears on a single layer, the text edits reflect changes only on the 
respective layer.
NOTE
NOTE
Engineers working in AutoCAD and Microsoft Visio can export drawings as layered 
files. When the PDF is opened in Acrobat, the layers created contain separate layer 
data. If you anticipate changing text, try to keep all the text on a single layer for a given drawing 
if it’s practical. You can then hide layers and select all the text on the text layer. Make your edits 
and the changes are reflected only on the layer(s) that was edited.

For more information on managing layers, see Chapter 24.
Adding new text to a document
You can also use the TouchUp Text tool to add a new line of text in a document. Select the TouchUp 
Text tool, press the Ctrl/Option key, and then click the mouse button in the area you want to add 
new text. The New Text Font dialog box opens as shown in Figure 13.7.
From the Font pull-down menu, you can select any font loaded in your system. You’re safe when 
choosing a font from the Font pull-down menu in the New Text Font dialog box since all fonts 
appearing in the menu are only those fonts loaded in your system.

OK in the dialog box and the cursor blinks at the location where you clicked the mouse button. The 
words “New Text” appear in a text field box. Type the text you want to add and open the TouchUp 
Properties dialog box by choosing Properties from a context menu. Select the check boxes for 
embedding and subsetting to embed the new text font in the document.
TIP
TIP
Acrobat does not permit any edits on text where a font has been embedded and 
the font is not installed on your system. To resolve the problem, you can select the 
text, open the TouchUp Properties dialog box, and select a system font from the Font pull-down 
menu. After you change a font to one available to your system, you can make text edits. Note 
that this workaround can only be used with fonts that don’t carry licensing restrictions.
Copying text with the TouchUp Text tool
The TouchUp Text tool is probably the last tool you want to use for copying text and pasting the 
text into other programs. I mention it here so you know what limitations you have in Acrobat for 
copying text with this tool. Inasmuch as the TouchUp Text tool enables you to copy multiple lines 
of text, you are limited to single paragraphs or short blocks of text.
To copy text with the TouchUp Text tool, click and drag the tool through the text block(s) you 
want to copy. The text is selected as you drag the mouse cursor. After making a selection, open a 
context menu and select Copy, as shown in Figure 13.8. Alternately, you can press Ctrl/Ô+C.
To paste text in a word processor or other application where pasting text is permitted, open the 
application and select the Paste command. Typically, you find Paste under the Edit menu. The text 
formatting of the pasted text can sometimes be better preserved if you copy text from tagged PDF 
documents.

 FIGURE 13.8
Open a context menu on selected text and choose Copy.
Setting Text Editing Preferences
You have some options for preference choices when using tools for text editing. Using the TouchUp 
Text tool doesn’t require you to make any preference changes. However, when using the Select tool 
you have some options in the General preferences settings. To open the Preferences dialog box, 
press Ctrl/Ô+K. When the Preferences dialog box opens, click General in the left pane. At the top 
of the right pane under the Basic Tools category are options that affect selecting text, as shown in 
Figure 13.9.
 FIGURE 13.9
Open the Preferences dialog box and click General in the left pane. Under the Basic Tools category are 
options for handling text selections.
Selecting the order of objects
The Basic Tools options shown in Figure 13.9 reflect the order that objects are selected (consider 
a text block as an object as you review this section). When you check the box for Make Select tool 

459

select images before text, images are selected first when images and text occupy the same space on a 
page. You use the Select tool to click in an area and the selection is made according to the prefer-
ence choice made in the Selection section of the General preferences. Selecting the Make hand tool 
select text&images check box and removing the Make Select tool select images before text reverses the 
order and, hence, text is selected before images when they both occupy the same space.
When I refer to occupying the same space, I’m talking about an image that may have a bounding 
box larger than the displayed image and text appears over the bounding box area, or when text is 
superimposed over an image.
Using the Hand tool for text selections
 
 If you’re editing text on a page, you can choose to make text selections with the Hand tool instead 
of the Select tool or the TouchUp Text tool. The preference setting for using the Hand tool to select 
text is located in the General preferences as shown in Figure 13.9. Unfortunately, there is no context 
menu option for switching the Hand tool between selecting text and using the hand tool for moving 
the document page. You can see the menu options in Figure 13.10 when opening a context menu 
with the Hand tool selected.
 FIGURE 13.10
A context menu opened from the Hand tool provides no option for switching the tool behavior between 
text selections and moving a document page around the Document pane.
With the Hand tool, you can move a page around in the Document pane or scroll pages when view-
ing pages in views other than Single Page view. If you move the cursor above any text, quickly drag 
the page around the Document pane to move the page. If you wait a moment, the cursor changes 
and any dragging you do selects text. If you accidentally select text when you wanted to move the 
page, deselect the text by clicking outside a text block. This can be frustrating because if you don’t 
click and drag fast enough, the Hand tool will select text when the respective preference option is 
selected. To disengage the text selection with the Hand tool, press the Spacebar on your keyboard. 
While the Spacebar is held down, the Hand tool returns to normal behavior and you can move the 
document page around the Document pane.

CAUTION 
CAUTION
If you enable text selection with the Hand tool and it’s not working, you need to 
make an adjustment in the Accessibility preferences. Open the Preferences dialog 
box and click Accessibility in the left pane. Remove the check mark for Always display keyboard 
selection cursor. If this item is checked, the Hand tool preference options cannot be changed.
Using the Select Tool
Users of earlier versions of Acrobat prior to version 7 will immediately notice the absence of the 
Select Text tool, the Select Table tool, and the Select Image tool. All three of these tools, perform-
ing all three functions, were combined in Acrobat 7 in the form of the Select tool.
 
 The Select tool is a much better choice than the TouchUp Text tool for selecting text to be copied 
from a PDF document and pasted in an editor, especially if you have multiple text blocks to copy. 
With this tool you can select multiple blocks of text and text in columns. However, you cannot make 
text edits with the tool like you do with the TouchUp Text tool.
To select text with the Select tool, click and drag the tool through the text on a page you want to 
copy. If a single column appears on the page, click just before the first character to be selected and 
drag down to the last character. Alternately, you can press the Alt/Option key and drag through a 
column of text to select it. Generally using the Alt/Option key enables you to create a more precise 
selection when columns are positioned close together. Acrobat won’t copy the text in the adjacent 
column as long as you stay within the boundaries of the column you are selecting. Figure 13.11 
shows text selected with the Select tool where only one column in a multiple-column layout is 
selected.
In conjunction with the Select tool, shortcut keys and mouse clicks provide several ways to make 
various text selections, including the following:
 Select a word. Double-click on a word, space, or character.
 Select a line of text. Triple-click anywhere on a line of text.
 Select all text on a page. Click four times (rapid successive clicks) to select all text on 
a page.
 Select a column of text. Click outside the text area and drag through the column or 
press the Alt/Option key as you drag the Select tool through a column of text.
 Select a contiguous block of text. Click and drag through the block of text or click 
the cursor at the beginning of the text to be selected, press Shift, and click at the end 
of the text block.
 Deselect text. Click outside of the text selection or press Ctrl/Ô+Shift+A.
Depending on choices you make for copying text, text pasted in other programs can retain certain 
formatting attributes. Your options for what you copy are derived from menu choices when you 
select text with the Select tool and open a context menu. When you select text, open a context menu 
as shown in Figure 13.12.

Additionally, adding a Bookmark and creating a link appear in the context menu. The remaining 
options in the menu are used for copying and exporting text.
Copying text
Most often you’ll find a difference when pasting text copied from tagged and untagged documents. 
In Figure 13.13, text was copied from an untagged file in Acrobat and pasted into a Microsoft Word

For information related to tagging PDF documents, see Chapter 25.
Copying multiple pages of text
If you view PDF files in a Single Page view, you can drag through the text on the page in view to 
select it. However, if you want to copy text on multiple pages, you need to change the view in a 
Scrolling mode. Zoom out of the document so you can see several pages in the Document pane 
and drag through the text you want to copy. If you need to copy more pages than those in view, 
drag the cursor to the bottom of the Acrobat window. The document pages scroll to place more 
pages in view. Keep the mouse button pressed as the pages appear in view, and release the mouse 
button on the last page you want to copy. In Figure 13.15, you can see a document in a Scrolling 
view and text selected on multiple pages.
To copy the text, select one of the Copy commands at the top of the context menu or choose 
Edit ➪ Copy.

Using the Select All command
If you have a need to select all the text on a page or throughout a PDF document, you can use the 
Select All menu command. Depending on the tool you use and the page view mode, text selections 
behave differently. You must first determine whether you want to select all the text on a page or all 
text in the document. When selecting text on a PDF page, be certain the page layout view is set to 
a One Full Page layout. Click the Select tool and choose Edit ➪ Select All or press Ctrl/Ô+A. All the 
text on a single page is selected. To copy the text you just selected, open a pop-up or context menu 
and select Copy. All the text is copied to the Clipboard and ready to paste into an editor.
If you want to select all text in a PDF document, change the page view to Scrolling Pages mode. 
Click the Select tool and choose Edit ➪ Select All or press Ctrl/Ô+A.
TIP
TIP
In earlier versions of Acrobat you had to click the Select tool and click the tool in 
a block of text, then use the Select All command. In Acrobat 8 and 9, just click the 
tool and then press Ctrl/Ô+A to select all text. If you want to select all document content (text 
and graphics), click the TouchUp Object tool and press Ctrl/Ô+A. For more on selecting 
images and graphics, see Chapter 15.
This method only works when you use the Select tool. If you select all text using the TouchUp Text 
tool, the selected text is confined to a bounding box and you must first click in a bounding box area in 
order to use the Select All command. On any given page there can be one or more bounding boxes, and 
using Select All selects all text only within a single bounding box. Regardless of which page layout view 
you choose, the TouchUp Text tool doesn’t permit text selections across multiple pages.
Copying a file to the Clipboard (Windows only)
Clicking the Select tool and choosing the Select All command selects all text in a document. You 
can also accomplish the same task by choosing Edit ➪ Copy File to Clipboard. Open your word 
processor and you can paste the text into a new document.
If you don’t see the menu command, you don’t have OLE-compliant applications installed on your 
computer. Microsoft’s OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) is installed by default with Office 
applications on Windows. If the menu command does not appear, use the Select All menu com-
mand to achieve the same results.
Copying and pasting text in word processors is best achieved by exporting PDFs using the 
File ➪ Save As command or by using File ➪ Export. You can export files as Microsoft Word and 
RTF (Rich Text Format) by selecting menu options from the task button pull-down menu. Much 
improved retention of formatting and page layout has been added to Acrobat 9, and you’ll find 
these methods much better than using copy/paste commands.

TIP
TIP
If you have some major text editing needed on one or two pages in a document, 
you can use the Extract Pages command from the Document menu to create a new 
PDF of just the pages you need to edit. Choose File ➪ Save As or File ➪ Export and save to 
Microsoft Word format. Edit the pages in Word and export to PDF. Open the original document 
and use the Document ➪ Replace pages command to replace the pages in your file with the new 
PDF document. (For more on page editing, see Chapter 16.)

Working with table data
You can copy and paste formatted text in columns and rows with the Select tool. If you want to 
paste data as tables or spreadsheets, Acrobat provides you options for copying table data and open-
ing selected table data in a spreadsheet program.
Copying and pasting table data
Select a table using the Select tool and choose Copy As Table from a pop-up or context menu. Once 
copied to the Clipboard, the data can be pasted in a word processing or spreadsheet program. When 
you paste the data in Microsoft Word, it appears as a table. Pasting in Microsoft Excel pastes the 
data in a spreadsheet document. If you use the Copy command, all data are pasted into a single 
cell in MS Excel. When selecting the Copy As Table command, the data are distributed into col-
umns and rows in Excel.
Opening selected data in a spreadsheet document
To export a table directly to Microsoft Excel, select columns and rows of text. From a pop-up menu 
or a context menu, select Open Table in Spreadsheet. By default, Acrobat launches Microsoft Excel 
and the selected data appear in a new spreadsheet, as shown in Figure 13.16.
 FIGURE 13.16
Select a table and choose Open in Spreadsheet from a pop-up menu or context menu and the data appear 
in a new spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel.

466
Editing PDFs
Part III
Saving data to a spreadsheet file
Another option you have for getting PDF data to a spreadsheet is to select the table with the Select 
tool and choose Save As Table from the Select tool pop-up or context menu. When you choose this 
command, the Acrobat Save As dialog box opens and offers you choices for saving your data in a 
variety of file formats. From the Save as Type (Windows) or Format (Macintosh) pull-down menu, 
select from the following:
 Comma Separated Values (*.csv). CSV-compliant applications can open files saved in 
this format. Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access recognize CSV data, and you can open 
the files directly in Excel. If you use other applications recognizing the format, use CSV.
 HTML 4.01 with CSS 1.0 (*.htm). If you need to get table data to a Web page, you can 
save the data to HTML format.
 Rich Text Format (*.rtf). If you want to import data into programs such as word pro-
cessing, accounting, and other applications that support RTF, save the file as RTF. If you 
want columns and rows of data without a table defined in the word processor, use the 
RTF format.
 Text (Tab Delimited) (*.txt). When you need to import data into a database manage-
ment system (DBMS), export the data as tab delimited. Tab delimited tables import into 
programs such as FileMaker Pro with data in separate fields and records.
 Unicode Text (Tab Delimited) (*.txt). If you use some foreign language kits, Unicode 
might be a better choice for your file exports. Select Unicode and import the data into 
applications supporting Unicode text data.
 XML 1.0 (*.xml). Acrobat supports exporting tables in XML format. XML data can be 
exchanged between many programs. If your workflow uses XML, save in this format.
 XML Spreadsheet (*.xml). This is an XML format defined by Microsoft and used in 
Office 2007. Use XML Spreadsheet when using XML data with spreadsheet applications 
such as Microsoft Excel 2007
Click the Save button and the data are saved in the file format you select from the pull-down menu 
in the Save As dialog box.
Overcoming problems with recognizing table data
If you select text in a table and you don’t see the Copy as Table, Save As Table, or Open Table in 
Spreadsheet command in a pop-up menu, Acrobat can’t recognize the data as a table. This is typi-
cally due to a file not having tags and structure. If you want to copy the data as a table or send the 
data to a spreadsheet application, you need to add tags to the document. To add tags, follow these 
steps:
Steps: Adding Tags to a PDF Document
 
1. Open the untagged file in Acrobat.
 
2. Add tags to the PDF. Choose Advanced ➪ Accessibility ➪ Add Tags to Document. Wait 
while Acrobat processes the document and adds the tags.

467
Editing Text
13
 
3. Close the Tags panel. After Acrobat adds tags, a report is shown in the Tags panel.
 
4. Select the table. Use the Select tool and select the table to be exported to a spreadsheet.
 
5. Open the pop-up menu. You should now see the menu items in the pop-up menu for 
copying/exporting the data to a spreadsheet.

For more on tagging files, see Chapter 25.
Looking Up Definitions
Whether you’re editing a PDF file or browsing documents, you can find the spelling and word 
definition for any text in an open document. This very nice little feature in Acrobat saves you time 
when looking up a definition. To employ the Look Up command from one of two context menus, 
use either the Hand tool or the Select tool and open a context menu. Text does not need to be 
selected, but the tool you use must be positioned over the word you want to look up. If using the 
Select tool, open the traditional context menu by right-clicking the mouse button (Windows) or 
Ctrl+clicking (Macintosh). From the menu choices, select Lookup “…”, placing your selected word 
inside the quotation marks. In Figure 13.17, you can see the context menu opened when the word 
Encapsulated was targeted for a lookup.
 FIGURE 13.17
Click a word with the Select tool or Hand tool. Open a context menu (right-click or Ctrl+click) and select 
Look Up “. . .” at the bottom of the menu.
After you make your selection, Acrobat launches the default Web browser and the browser takes 
you to the Dictionary.com Web site. The Web page opens on the word selected in the PDF docu-
ment. You can check for spelling errors, word definitions, pronunciation, and browse through a 
thesaurus. If you have an account for the Web site, you can click on the audio button to hear an 
audio pronunciation through your computer speaker(s).
Currently, Acrobat only supports U.S. English as a language. Regardless of whether you have a for-
eign language kit installed, Acrobat launches the Dictionary.com Web site.
Working with Text in New Blank Pages
Additional text tools and text editing features are available to you when creating a blank new page 
in Acrobat. A separate set of preferences and tools appear when you create a new blank page.

468
Editing PDFs
Part III
Acrobat is not intended to be an original document authoring program. The text editing feature 
in Acrobat is designed to offer a simple solution for creating documents when you want to write a 
memo, create a cover page for a PDF Portfolio, or add some text to a page and send your document 
as a PDF to other users.
Setting text attributes
To create a blank new page in Acrobat, select File ➪ Create PDF ➪ From Blank Page. A new blank 
page opens in the document pane with a text box and a toolbar that loads automatically when the 
new page is created. The New Document Toolbar shown in Figure 13.18 opens when a new page 
is created, or you can access the toolbar in the More Tools window. However, the tools in this tool-
bar can only be used in documents created from the New Blank Page command.
 FIGURE 13.18
The New Document Toolbar tools are only available in documents created as blank new pages.
Tools you have available for formatting text only in the text box created on a new blank page 
include:
 Text color. The first tool in the New Document Toolbar contains a pull-down menu where 
a color palette opens. The choices you have for text colors are the same as you have avail-
able using the TouchUp Text Properties dialog box shown in Figure 13.6 earlier in this 
chapter.
 Paragraph formatting. The Left, Center, Right, and Justified tools are used to format text 
alignment.
 Fonts. The pull-down menu displays all the fonts loaded in your system. Select a font 
and the font name is displayed in the text box. Adjacent to the pull-down menu is the 
Size pull-down menu. Make a choice from fixed font sizes or type a font size in the text 
box. The sizes you can type in the Size text box range from 4 points to 300 points.
 Text Style. Text styles are from left to right in the New Document Toolbar: Bold, Italic, 
Underline, Strike-through, Superscript, and Subscript.
 Indents. The last two text tools in the New Document Toolbar are used for paragraph 
indenting. The Left Indent and Right Indent tools appear just before the Page Setup tool.
 Page Setup. Click the Page Setup tool and the Page Setup dialog box opens as shown in 
Figure 13.19. In the Page Setup dialog box, you can select from a number of fixed page 
sizes by choosing an option in the Size pull-down menu. Additionally, you can choose an 

469

option for Portrait or Landscape pages in the Page area of the dialog box. Margins are set 
in the four text boxes at the top of the dialog box. Click the Always use these settings check 
box and your settings are applied as a new default each time you create a new blank page.
NOTE
NOTE
You cannot resize the text box added to a blank new page using any tool in Acrobat. 
All text box sizes are determined by the margin settings in the Page Setup dialog 
box or the New Document preferences.
 FIGURE 13.19
Click the Page Setup tool and the Page Setup dialog box opens where page size and margins attributes are 
selected.
Setting preferences
Preferences can be set for the page attributes by selecting New Document preferences in the Preferences 
dialog box. Open the Preferences dialog box by pressing Ctrl/Ô+K and click New Document in the 
left pane. The options for page setup shown in Figure 13.20 are the same as when clicking the Page 
Setup tool in the New Document Toolbar.
Using the PDF Editor
When you create a blank new page, Acrobat shifts the normal editing mode to a unique editor 
called the PDF Editor that is available only with blank new pages. By default a text box is created 
for you according to the preference options you made for page size and margins. Working in the 
PDF Editor differs from using other editing tools and commands in Acrobat when working in a 
normal edit mode.

 FIGURE 13.20
Open Preferences and click New Document in the left pane to display the preference choices for creating

 Keyboard shortcuts in the PDF Editor
At first you may think there are anomalies when trying to use keyboard shortcuts when the Page 
Editor is active. Using Ctrl/Ô++ (plus sign) and Ctrl/Ô+- (minus sign) won’t zoom a page. Ctrl/
Ô+0 (zero) is consistent with using the standard edit mode for fitting a page in the Document 
pane. Using keyboard shortcuts for sizing text and changing font styles are all different in the PDF 
Editor than you have available in standard edit mode. The keyboard shortcuts that are used with 
the PDF Editor include:
 Bold text. Ctrl/Ô+B.
 Italicize text. Ctrl/Ô+I.
 Underline text. Ctrl/Ô+U.
 Increase text size. Ctrl/Ô+] (right bracket).
 Decrease text size. Ctrl/Ô+[ (left bracket).
 Superscript text. Ctrl/Ô+Shift++ (plus sign).

471

 Subscript text. Ctrl/Ô++ (plus sign).
 Left Justify. Ctrl/Ô+L.
 Right Justify. Ctrl/Ô+R.
 Justified. Ctrl/Ô+J.
Tools and commands in the PDF Editor
When you create a blank new page, the text box added to the page is not something you can delete. 
The Select Object tool is not functional while in PDF Editor mode. However, you can use the TouchUp 
Object tool to temporarily convert a text selection to an object. With an object you can perform 
various editing tasks you don’t have available with the text tools such as rotating, clipping, scaling, 
and cropping objects.
You might use something like rotation to create a document you want to use as a watermark. In 
Figure 13.21, I created text with the text tools in the New Document toolbar. I clicked the text 
with the TouchUp Object tool and from a context menu I chose Rotate Selection.
 Resume Editing. If you click a tool like the Hand tool or the Select Object tool, you 
loose the text box on the new blank page. It’s there, but appears invisible and you exit 
the PDF Editor. To switch back to the PDF Editor you can select Document ➪ Resume 
Editing. Click in the text box and you can type or edit text. You can also reenter the PDF 
Editor mode by clicking the Select tool and click inside the text box or click any one of 
the text tools in the New Document Toolbar. If you save a file created as a blank new 
page and reopen the file in another Acrobat editing session, select Document ➪ Resume 
Editing and you again gain access to the PDF Editor where text cane be added or edited 
in the default text box.
 Prevent Further Edits. You can lock the text you add to a text box by selecting Document 
Prevent Further Edits. The Prevent Further Edits dialog box opens as shown in Figure 13.23. 
Click Prevent Further Edits and the text box is locked and remains not editable. Be aware 
that when you click the Prevent Further Edits button in the Prevent Further Edits dialog 
box that you cannot regain an editing status, nor can you use the Edit ➪ Undo command. 
Selecting Document ➪ Resume Editing won’t bring the text box back to the PDF Editor 
where any text editing can be performed.
The conversion of text to an object is temporary. You can edit the text after converting to an object 
by clicking the Select tool in the text block. Doing so, however, removes all edits you made with 
the TouchUp Object tool.

PDF Editor behavior
A few things you’ll notice when using the PDF Editor as you add other content to the page such as 
comments, form fields, and copied and pasted text include:
 Comments. You can add comments to the text block on a blank new page. However, 
the comments are static and remain fixed to the coordinates when you first added a com-
ment. For example, using a Text Edit tool or a markup comment tool to highlight text or 
mark text on the page stays in position where you added the comment. If you type text in 
the text box, the text flows but the comments remain in the original position.
 Form Fields. Form fields can be added to the page and appear aside or over a text box. 
When you engage the PDF Editor to add or edit text in the text box, the form fields, as 
well as comment notes, are temporarily hidden.
 Pasting text. You can copy text from another PDF page or from a word processor or text 
editor and paste the text into the blank new page text box. To paste text in the text box, 
select Edit ➪ Paste or press Ctrl/Ô+V. Text pasted in the text box retains formatting from 
the copied text. If the text overflows the text box, you can’t resize the box and text after 
the last visible line of text at the bottom of the box flows to a new page.
 Copying text. When you select text in the text box on a blank new page, you don’t have 
access to commands when copying text like you do when copying text using the Select 
Text tool. To copy text, use Edit ➪ Copy or press Ctrl/Ô+C.
 Adding new text. Text on a blank new page can be added to the text box automatically 
added to the blank new page. You can use Ctrl/Ô and click with the TouchUp Text tool 
only outside the text box to create new text. Pasted text that extends beyond the text 
placeholder automatically flows to create new pages.

Working around the PDF Editor
Unfortunately, Acrobat doesn’t provide you a preference option to create a new blank document 
without the default text block. You might want to create a blank document you use to temporarily 
paste form fields or simply add images to a blank new document. The default text block can get in 
the way and make your editing task a little awkward.
To create a blank new document without the text block, use the File ➪ Create PDF ➪ From Blank 
Page command to create the new blank document. Next, choose Document ➪ Prevent Further 
Edits. The Prevent Further Edits dialog box opens as shown in Figure 13.22.
Click the Prevent Further Edits button and a Save As dialog box opens. Click Cancel in the Save As 
dialog box and you no longer have the txt frame on the blank page.
 FIGURE 13.22
Choose Document ➪ Prevent Further Edits to open the Prevent Further Edits dialog box.
Alternate methods for creating blank pages
You can create a File ➪ New menu command using JavaScript that provides you options for creat-
ing predefined page sizes different than the From Blank Page command, and you can create cus-
tom pages that are user defined. In Figure 13.23 you can see such a command that was created 
with JavaScript added to the File menu.
 FIGURE 13.23
Using JavaScript you can add new menu items to Acrobat such as this one for creating new blank pages.

474
Editing PDFs
Part III
The script is a bit elaborate so I added the file containing the script to the CD-ROM accompanying 
this book. To add the menu item you need to copy the text file (newPage.js) containing the 
JavaScript to your JavaScript folder. Quit Acrobat and copy the file to:
On Windows, copy the file to C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat 9.0\Acrobat\
JavaScripts.
On the Mac, copy the file to Macintosh HD: Users: User name:Library: Acrobat User 
Data:9.0_x86:JavaScripts.
Launch Acrobat and you’ll find the File ➪ New menu command with the same options shown in 
Figure 13.23.
Summary
 You use the TouchUp Text tool to make minor edits on PDF pages. You can use the tool 
to change font attributes, add new lines of text, and access a Properties dialog box where 
you can select fonts to embed and subset.
 The TouchUp Text tool is not well suited for copying and pasting text data into other 
programs. Text selections are limited and text formatting is lost when pasting text into 
other programs.
 Use the Select tool to select text on a page, across multiple pages, and all text in a document.
 When pasting text copied from a Select tool selection in a tagged file, the text data retains 
much integrity and can be edited with minimum character and paragraph reformatting.
 Text can be edited on visible layers. You can’t select text on hidden layers with the Select 
All command. Edits made to text appearing on all layers result in changes on all layers. 
Edits made to text on a single layer result in changes on a single layer.
 You also use the Select tool to select table data. You can copy and paste tables in other 
applications and save the data to a number of different file formats.
 The File ➪ Create PDF ➪ From Blank Page menu command creates new pages with a text 
box and text tools that only appear when creating blank new pages.
 You can use JavaScript to add a menu command for creating blank new pages.

A 
marvelous feature introduced in Acrobat 8 was the Redaction tools, 
which are used for removing data from PDF documents. In Acrobat 9, 
Adobe has expanded the tool options that provide you more sophis-
ticated options for searching and redacting content in PDF files.
The Redaction tools appear in Acrobat Professional on the Mac and Acrobat 
Pro and Acrobat Pro Extended on Windows. You won’t find Redaction fea-
tures in Acrobat Standard on Windows.
In this chapter you learn about redaction, why and when it is necessary, the 
new Acrobat 9 features, and how to use all the Redaction tools.
Setting Up the Work Environment
Load the Redaction and Advanced Editing tools for applying redactions to 
documents. You’ll find Redaction tools in a separate toolbar and accessible 
from a context menu opened from the Toolbar Well, or select Tools ➪ Customize 
Toolbars to open the More Tools window. Alternately, you can select More Tools 
from the context menu. When the More Tools window opens, check the 
Advanced Editing Toolbar and scroll the list to the Redaction Toolbar and 
check the box adjacent to the toolbar name. You can selectively toggle indi-
vidual tools within the toolbar in the More Tools window by checking and 
unchecking the tool names in the toolbar list. In this chapter, you look at all 
tools, so be certain check marks appear adjacent to all the tool names in the 
Redaction toolbar.

What Is Redaction?
Quite simply, redaction is the removal of visual information from a document. You might want to 
use redaction to remove sensitive information for security purposes, to protect rights and privacy 
information, to eliminate classified information, to delete names of minors in legal documents, or 
to delete any other information you don’t want viewed by others.
Redaction is much different than blotting out or hiding text, graphics, handwriting, or any other 
kind of marks. If you use tools like some of the comment tools to create markups that blot out some 
text and graphics in a document, the items are not permanently deleted. It appears fine onscreen 
where you can’t see items marked for deletion on a document page, but the PDF document still 
contains the original items. If the file is distributed, other users can access marked text and other 
data.
To understand why redaction tools are needed to permanently delete content from a PDF docu-
ment, see the following steps.
STEPS: Understanding the need for redaction
 
1. Open a PDF document in Acrobat.
 
2. Open the Comment & Markup tools. Open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and 
select Comment and Markup. The Comment & Markup tools open in a floating toolbar.
 
3. Mark out some text. Select the Rectangle tool in the Comment & Markup toolbar. Draw 
a rectangle around some text. Alternately, you can use the Highlight tool so select text 
and hide it with a dark highlight color.
 
4. Open the rectangle comment properties. Right-click (Windows) or Control+click 
(Macintosh) to open a context menu on the rectangle. Select Properties from the context 
menu.
 
5. Edit the properties. Click the Color swatch for both Color and Fill Color. From the 
color choices select Black, as shown in Figure 14.1. Click the Make Properties Default 
check box. The next time you draw a rectangle the rectangle will have the same style and 
fill color.
 
6. Draw additional rectangles. Using the rectangle comment tool, draw some additional 
rectangles to block out more text. In Figure 14.2, I have a text document with several 
markings where I don’t want the text to be seen. Onscreen this is fine, but the text is not 
deleted and can be extracted by other users.
 
7. Copy the text. Click the Select tool and drag through the text to select it. Select Edit ➪ 
Copy to copy the text, as shown in Figure 14.3. Note that you can also use the Search 
pane and search for text that you marked. You’ll notice that the search results report all 
the hidden text.

8. Paste the text in a word processor. In my example I open Microsoft Word and select 
Edit ➪ Paste. As you can see in Figure 14.4, I was able to copy the text beneath all my 
comment markups.
 FIGURE 14.4
When you paste all the text in a Word processor, the marked out text appears in the 
new document window.
As shown in Figure 14.4, this form of redacting a document doesn’t delete the marked text. You 
need another method to mark and eliminate data from PDFs. This is where the Redaction tools in 
Acrobat come into play.
Getting a Grip on the Redaction Tools
Redaction is permanently deleting text, graphics, signatures, handwriting, and any other data you 
want to remove from a document. In addition to marking and deleting text and other data that 
you can see, a good redaction tool also provides you a means for deleting certain metadata and 
hidden information in a file so all the content you decide you want to eliminate cannot be retrieved 
by anyone viewing your PDF files.
Using the Redaction tools
Acrobat 9 offers a few solutions for marking content for deletion, applying the redactions, eliminating 
metadata, and eliminating any hidden text. You first start a redaction session using the Redaction 
tools. When you open the Redaction toolbar by selecting View ➪ Toolbars ➪ Redaction, choosing 
Advanced ➪ Redaction ➪ Show Redaction Toolbar, or selecting the toolbar in the More Tools win-
dow, the tools contained in the toolbar appear as you see in Figure 14.5.

479
Redacting PDFs
14
 FIGURE 14.5
The Redaction toolbar contains four tools.
The tools on the Redaction toolbar are as follows:
 Mark for Redaction. Use this tool to mark text and other data that you want to delete 
from a document. Marking the content does not yet delete it from the file.
 Apply Redactions. When you are ready to permanently delete content that you marked 
for deletion, click the Apply Redactions tool.
 Redaction Properties. Use this tool to set the redaction-marking properties. You can 
mark content using the Mark for Redaction tool and the markings can be adjusted for 
color and other attributes in the Redaction Tool Properties dialog box. Click the tool 
and the Redaction Tool Properties dialog box shown in Figure 14.6 opens.
 FIGURE 14.6
Click the Redaction Properties tool and the Redaction Tool Properties dialog box opens.

As you can see in the Redaction Tool Properties dialog box, you can select a color for 
your redaction marks, use text as an overlay, specify the font for the overlay text, set a 
number of different font attributes for the overlay text, and select from some redaction 
code standards. When you change the properties in this dialog box, the properties remain 
in effect for all redaction marks you make on a document until you again make settings 
adjustments in the Redaction Tool Properties dialog box.
 Search and Redact. This tool is a powerful addition to the Redaction tools. Click the Search 
and Redact tool and the Search window opens as shown in Figure 14.7. Type a word or 
phrase in the first field text box and choose a location. Your options include searching the

As a workflow solution you can open a PDF document, copy text on a page containing several 
words and phrases you want to redact, and paste the copied text in a word processor or text editor. 
Delete the text you don’t want to redact and you’re left with just those words you want to eliminate 
from the PDF file. Save the file as a text document and import the word list in the Search window. 
Using this method helps keep the spelling errors to a minimum and easily helps you form your 
word list.
The export button enables you to export a word list to a text file. This option can be handy when 
you have several documents you want to redact at different times. Perhaps, during a court case you 
may receive documents at different intervals, but the sensitive information remains the same on all 
documents. As new documents come in, you can import the text file you originally exported from 
the Search window.

Searching patterns
A pattern or mask is a formatted body of text — something like a social security number or phone 
number. Say you want to delete all social security numbers from a document but there are many 
unique numbers and without searching a pattern you would have to mark each individual number 
for redaction.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
Acrobat 9 takes the redundant task of marking each individual pattern such as a 
social security number, a zip code, an email address, a phone number, credit card 
numbers, and dates away by providing you a method for searching patterns.
To search a pattern, click the Search and Redact tool in the Redaction toolbar. In the Search window, 
click the Patterns radio button and make a choice from the pull-down menu as shown in Figure 
14.10. Click the Search and Redact button and Acrobat searches the open document or a folder of 
documents for the pattern and identifies it for marking for redaction in the Search window.

need to click the Apply Redactions tool to delete the marked words. When searching for patterns, 
you click the Check All button after performing a search, then click the Mark Checked Results

Redacting PDF Files
The tool set and options for redaction are very straightforward and intuitive. In the first section of 
this chapter, you looked at marking files to hide content that didn’t remove the items you marked. 
Let’s compare that first effort with a true redaction that Acrobat 8 provides you by following some 
steps.
STEPS: Redacting a PDF document
 
1. Open a file you want to eliminate some content from by using the Redaction tools.
 
2. Click the Mark for Redaction tool.
 
 When you first click the Mark for Redaction tool, the Using Redaction Tools help dialog 
box opens, as shown in Figure 14.11. This dialog box provides you some instructions on 
redacting documents. If you don’t want the dialog box to open in future redaction ses-
sions, click the Don’t show again check box.
 FIGURE 14.11
When you first click the Mark for Redaction tool, the Using Redaction Tools help dialog 
box opens.
 
3. Mark a graphic for redaction. If you have a graphic in the file either as a vector object or 
an image file, you can remove it just like removing text. In my example I have a logotype 
that is a graphic object. Clicking the Mark for Redaction tool changes your cursor to a 
crosshair when positioned over a graphic or an I-beam cursor when positioned over text. 
Draw a marquee around the object, as shown in Figure 14.12, or drag the I-beam cursor 
through text you want to redact.

If you want to quickly mark a graphic object for redaction, select the Mark for 
Redaction tool and double-click on the graphic.
 FIGURE 14.12

4. Mark text for redaction. Drag the I-beam cursor through the first occurrence of text you 
want to redact. In my example I drag through a name I want to remove from the file.
 
5. Click the Search and Redact tool. The Search window opens. Type any other occurrence 
of the text you want to redact. In my example, I type the same name as the first text 
marked for redaction. Click the Search and Redact button and the first occurrence of the 
word to be redacted is highlighted.
 
6. Check all occurrences for redaction. In the Search window, click the Check All button 
and all occurrences of the search results are now marked for redaction.
 
7. Mark the search results for redaction. After clicking the Check All button, the Marked 
Checked Results button appears in the Search window. Click this button and all occur-
rences of the search results are now marked for redaction, as you see in Figure 14.13.
 
8. Continue marking all the content you want to eliminate in your document. If you 
have other text or graphics you want to redact, follow the same steps outlined in Steps 3 
to 7.
 
9. Apply Redactions. Click the Apply Redactions tool. A warning dialog box opens. Click 
Yes and the redactions are applied.

 FIGURE 14.13
After clicking Check All or individually checking the items you want to redact in the 
open PDF or from a collection of PDF files, click the Mark Checked Results for 
Redaction button.
 
10. Redact additional content. After Acrobat redacts the items you marked, a dialog box 
opens confirming your action and prompts you to examine the document for additional 
content. Additional content might be in the form of metadata such as Document Properties 
information, hidden text, and a variety of other sources you don’t see when viewing a 
PDF file in the Document pane. Click Yes in the dialog box shown in Figure 14.14.
 
11. Examine the document. When you click Yes in the confirmation dialog box, the Examine 
Document panel opens. A number of different items can appear in your file that don’t 
appear on the document pages. You might have metadata, hidden text, file attachments, 
hidden layers, bookmarks, and other items that use the same text you want to delete. To 
be certain all information is deleted from the document, the Examine Document dialog box 
provides a list of found items matching the items you deleted. Click the Remove button in 
the panel shown in Figure 14.15 and all the selected items are removed.

In Acrobat 8, a separate dialog box opened to inform you of the kind of document 
information that exists in your file and options via radio buttons for deleting the 
additional information. New in Acrobat 9 you find the Examine Document information hosted in 
a navigation panel and docked in the Navigation pane.
 
12. Verify the redactions were made. If you used objects with fills to redact the document, 
these objects are selectable and you can delete them. Select Tools ➪ Advanced Editing ➪ 
Touchup Object Tool to select the Touchup Object tool. Move the tool to one of your 
marks and click. Press the Delete (Del) key on your keyboard and the redaction frame is 
deleted. You can easily see that the redaction process did indeed remove the underlying 
content.
 
 You should see that the text beneath the redaction frames has truly been deleted from your 
document. When you use the select tool and drag through the text, you’ll notice that no 
selection appears where you redacted text (and/or objects) as shown in Figure 14.16. 
Alternately, you can verify redactions by opening the Search window and invoking a 
search for the words you redacted. You should see no results reported for all text that 
was redacted.

Summary
 Redaction involves permanently removing data from a file.
 Acrobat 9 Pro (Windows and Mac) and Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows) contains tools 
for redacting content, searching and redacting, applying redactions, and examining docu-
ments for content not visible on pages. Redaction options are not available in Acrobat 
Standard (Windows).
 Using tools other than the Redaction tools won’t delete data from PDF files.
 Redaction marks can be modified for color changes, the use of text, and formatted text 
used to replace deleted data.
 After redacting a document you can choose to Examine Document information for addi-
tional content that may appear as metadata or hidden text. The Examine Document infor-
mation has been moved from a dialog box in Acrobat 8 to a navigation panel in Acrobat 9.

I
mages and objects, such as raster images from programs like Adobe 
Photoshop, vector images like those created in Adobe Illustrator, and 
text, can be edited in external editors and dynamically updated in a PDF 
document. The process involves launching the external editor from within 
Acrobat, making changes in the external editor, and saving the file. The file 
is treated like a link to the PDF where the edits are updated. Acrobat itself 
doesn’t have any image editing tools, but you can use the external editors 
provided through companion programs to help out when you need to make 
modifications to objects in a PDF file.
Like editing text discussed in Chapter 13, image editing with Acrobat is 
intended to be a minor task for last-minute small changes. For major editing 
tasks, you should return to the original authoring program. In circumstances 
where you do not have an original document, you may need to extend the 
editing a little further by updating documents or exporting them for new lay-
outs. In this chapter, you learn how to handle images and objects for editing 
and exporting purposes.
Setting Up the Editing 
Environment
Tools used for image editing are the same as those used in Chapter 13 for 
text editing. Refer to Chapter 13 to load the necessary tools and toolbars 
to follow along in this chapter. Your Toolbar Well should look similar to 
Figure 15.1.

Selecting Images
Two tools in Acrobat enable you to copy images and objects. You can use the Select tool discussed 
in Chapter 13 to select images as well as text, and you also use the TouchUp Object tool to select 
images and objects. Objects can be vector-based artwork created in programs such as Adobe 
Illustrator and blocks of text that Acrobat interprets as objects. Only the TouchUp Object tool can 
be used to select objects; therefore, you cannot use the Select tool unless the item is an image such 
as a Photoshop file contained in the PDF document.
The distinction between text as text and text as an object can easily be understood in what you see 
selected in the Document pane. If you drag the Select tool through text, the text becomes high-
lighted. When you see the text highlighted, realize that the text is selected as text. When you click 
a text block with the TouchUp Object tool, you’ll see a bounding box (border) around the text 
block but the text itself is not highlighted. When you see this view, you can be assured the text is 
selected as an object. In Figure 15.2, text is selected as text by dragging through it with the Select 
tool, and in Figure 15.3, multiple text blocks are selected as objects when dragging through text 
with the TouchUp Object tool.
 FIGURE 15.2
Text selected with the Select tool is selected as text and highlighted.

 FIGURE 15.3
Text selected with the TouchUp Object tool is selected as an object and appears with a bounding box 
(border).
Each tool has different options and editing features associated with it. You use the Select tool, for 
example, when you want to select a photo image, copy it in Acrobat, and paste it in another pro-
gram. Once copied to the Clipboard, you can also paste the image back into a PDF document, but 
the image is pasted as a Stamp comment. Double-click the image and an associated pop-up note 
appears like other comments, as shown in Figure 15.4.
The Select tool permits you to save an image as a separate file. Additionally, you can edit metadata 
for image files using this tool.
 FIGURE 15.4
When pasting images copied with the Select tool, the pasted image appears as a Stamp comment.

494
Editing PDFs
Part III
The TouchUp Object tool permits you to copy an image in a PDF document and paste it back to 
the same document or another PDF document as an image. All the paste operations remain inside 
Acrobat, as you cannot copy with the TouchUp Object tool and paste an image or object into another 
program. Furthermore, you cannot save an image file using the TouchUp Object tool as you can 
with the Select tool, but you can launch an external editor to edit either an image or object. When 
you want to edit images in Acrobat, the TouchUp Object tool provides you a number of different 
editing options — more so than the Select tool.
Using the Select tool
 
 In Chapter 13, you used the Select tool to select text and tables. You can also select images with 
this tool. As was covered in Chapter 13, you have some preference choices for handling selections 
when using the Select tool. If your last visit to the General preferences was to select text before 
images, you need to return to the General preferences by pressing Ctrl/Ô+K, click General in the 
left pane, and select Make Select tool select images before text in the Basic Tool Options, as shown 
in Figure 15.5.
 FIGURE 15.5
Open the General preferences and select the check box for Make Select tool select images before text.
Click an image and select Copy Image from a context menu as shown in Figure 15.6.
Interactivity
From the context menu, you can add a Bookmark or link to the selected image. Click Bookmark from 
the context menu and the default view of the page is bookmarked. Click Create Link and the 
Create Link dialog box opens.

Pasting images
As I said earlier in this section, images copied with the Select tool are pasted back into PDF docu-
ments as Stamp comments. The appearance onscreen looks like an image pasted into a document, 
but it remains a comment. If you want to print images pasted from content copied with the Select 
tool, you need to print using the Document and Stamps option in the Print dialog box.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on printing documents and stamps, see Chapter 31.
Use the Select tool to paste images into other programs. Pasted images in Acrobat appear as Stamp 
comments, but in other programs pasting is handled as you would expect when copying and past-
ing between other programs. The complete image is pasted into documents such as Microsoft 
Office files and other application documents.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
If you use professional layout and illustration programs designed for commercial 
printing, don’t paste files in these applications. A preferred method is to save an 
image file from Acrobat and place or import the image in your design application.
Transforming pasted images
When you paste an image as a Stamp comment, you can size and rotate the image. From the four 
corners on a Stamp comment you see corner handles and in the top center you see another handle. 
Click and drag any corner handle to size the image up or down. No modifier key is required to 
proportionally resize a Stamp comment. All the sizing is kept to proportions without pressing the 
Shift key.
To rotate a Stamp comment, place the cursor over the middle top handle. When the cursor appears 
over this handle, the cursor changes to a semicircle with an arrowhead, as shown in Figure 15.7. 
Click and drag when you see this cursor to rotate the Stamp.

Saving image files
From a context menu opened by right-clicking (Windows) or Control+clicking (Macintosh) you can 
save an image file when using the Select tool. Select Save Image As (shown in Figure 15.7) and 
the Save Image As dialog box opens. From the Save as type (Windows) shown in Figure 15.8 or 
Format (Macintosh) pull-down menu you have options for saving in one of three file formats. 
Choose the default Bitmap Image Files (*.bmp), JPEG Image Files (.jpg), or TIFF Image Files (*.tif) 
format.
 FIGURE 15.8
Choose Save As from a context menu and choose the file type from the Save as type pull-down menu.
Saving as a bitmap file saves the file without compression and data loss. However, bitmap files may 
not retain all the data in the image. If you have images with clipping paths or drop shadows, for 
example, the saved image can appear significantly degraded, as shown in Figure 15.9.
NOTE
NOTE
A clipping path is a mask like a cookie cutter that cuts out all the image data outside 
the path. Without the clipping path and drop shadow the image in Figure 15.9 would 
have a white background around the image instead of transparent space.
JPEG files retain all data integrity; however, the downside to saving as JPEG is that the files are 
compressed and you end up with data loss. Use the TIFF format when you can and you’ll save your 
files without data loss. As you can see in Figure 15.9, an image with a clipping path saved as a bit-
map on the left is degraded compared to the correct detail shown in the TIFF export on the right.

497
Editing Images and Objects

TIP
TIP
If you’re not certain whether a BMP file will be saved, thus preserving all data integ-
rity, you can select the image with the Select tool, copy the file to the Clipboard, 
and from the Create PDF Task Button pull-down menu, select Create File From Clipboard Image. 
Acrobat creates a separate PDF document and the image you see appears exactly as when saving 
as a BMP file. If the file looks good, save the PDF or return to the image and select Save Image As 
from a context menu.
 FIGURE 15.9
Saving files with clipping paths in bitmap format can present problems with image quality. Saving the 
same file as a TIFF (right) preserves data integrity.
Image Properties
Select Image Properties from a context menu and document metadata are reported for the image.

Recognize Text Using OCR
You may not see the Recognize Text Using OCR menu command when selecting images with the 
select tool. Images imported in a layout program won’t give you the option for converting image 
data to recognizable text. If you have a scanned document and open the image in Acrobat, you 
might see this command. Use it for converting images to recognizable text.

Using the TouchUp Object tool
 
 You use the TouchUp Object tool for selecting objects on a page. You select photo 
 images, drawings and illustrations, and blocks of text with the tool.
The TouchUp Object tool copies images and objects and pastes them back into a PDF or other PDF 
documents you open in Acrobat. You can click an image or object or marquee several images and/or 
objects to select multiple items. Acrobat interprets any text you click on with the TouchUp Object 
tool as an object. Hence, you can edit the object in an external editor or move the object(s).
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on external editing, see the section “Image and Object External 
Editing” later in this chapter.
You can also use the TouchUp Object tool to move or nudge objects. Click on a single object or 
marquee a group of objects on a page, and then click and drag the selection to a new location. You 
are limited to moving objects on a single page. You can’t select an object on one page and drag it 
to another PDF page. For moving objects to different pages you need to cut the selection, move to 
another page, and choose Edit ➪ Paste. If you want to nudge objects, create a selection with the 
TouchUp Object tool and press the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the object right, left, up, 
or down.

499
Editing Images and Objects

NOTE
NOTE
If two or more images or objects are spaced apart and each object is selectable, you 
can click to select an object and Shift+click to select additional images/objects. If 
you have objects such as vector graphics where many paths are contained within the object or you 
have multiple overlapping objects, marquee the objects to be certain you select all you want to 
copy.
To copy and paste objects, including photo images, illustrations and vector objects, and text blocks, 
you use the TouchUp Object tool. To select a single object, click the object with the TouchUp Object 
tool. A keyline border shows the bounding box for the selected item. Open a context menu and you 
find menu options different from those available with the Select tool, as shown in Figure 15.11.
The menu offers several commands related to handling images and objects. Select Copy to copy the 
image to the Clipboard and select Cut to cut the image from the page and place it on the Clipboard. 
From either choice you can then paste the data on another PDF page or into another PDF document.
Pasting images and objects
After copying with the TouchUp Object tool, choose Edit ➪ Paste or use a context menu opened 
with the tool and select Paste. When pasting data, the new image or object is pasted in the fore-
ground. If you need to keep a stacking order intact, you need to carefully plan out copying and 
pasting images and objects. In more complex documents, it makes sense to return to the original 
authoring program because you do not have commands in Acrobat to paste in front, paste in back, 
and paste in place. These kinds of commands are found in design programs where you can easily 
control the stacking order of images and objects.
 FIGURE 15.11

If you want to replace text, images, or objects on a page with a pasted block of text, an image, or 
an object, select the items you want to replace after copying the item you want to paste. Choose 
Edit ➪ Paste or use Paste from a context menu, and the pasted item replaces the selected items.
Place Image
Placing images is like using a Place command in a layout program. When you select the command, 
a dialog box opens where you can select an image on your hard drive and import the image in 
your layout.
Acrobat 9 supports placing images much like layout programs. Click the TouchUp Object tool 
and open a context menu on a document page. The Place Image command appears when opening 
a context menu on a page or when selecting an image and opening a context menu. The Open 
dialog box appears where you can navigate your hard drive and locate the file you want to import 
in your PDF file. File formats supported using this command include Bitmap, BMP (*.bmp, *.rle, 
*.dlb), CompuServe GIF (*.gif), JPEG (*.jpg, *.jpeg, .jpe), JPEG2000 (.jpf, *.ipx, *.jp2, .j2k, .j2c, 
jpc), PCX (.pcx), PNG (.png), and TIFF (.tif, *.tiff). When one of these file formats is imported into 
a PDF document, Acrobat converts to PDF and imports the image.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on file formats, see Chapters 11 and 12.
TIP
TIP
If you select an image on a PDF page with the TouchUp Object tool and select Place 
Image from a context menu, the selected image is replaced with the new image you 
select in the Open dialog box.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Be certain to not select any objects on a page with the TouchUp Object tool when 
you use Place Image. Placing image data while an object is selected will replace the 
selected object. This is handy if you intentionally want to replace an object, but can be trouble-
some if you don’t want a selected object replaced.
Delete Clip
The context menu opened with the TouchUp Object tool contains the Delete Clip menu command. 
You can delete a clipping path from an image or object that had the path applied in an image edi-
tor like Photoshop or an illustration program such as Adobe Illustrator. Deleting a path shows data 
outside the defined path. In Figure 15.12 you can see an image where a clipping path was created 
in Photoshop to hide edge artifacts on the left and after removing the clipping path on the right 
side of the figure where the artifacts are visible.
Delete Clip also performs another function. You can set a clip on an image with or without a clip-
ping path using the TouchUp Object tool context menu. Once a clip has been set, use the Delete 
Clip command to remove the clip. To completely understand the results, see the section “Set Clip” 
next.

 FIGURE 15.12
Selecting Delete Clip from a context menu removes clipping paths assigned to objects and images.
Set Clip
Select the TouchUp Object tool, click an image on a PDF page, and from a context menu select 
Set Clip.
The Set Clip command enables you to clip (actually Crop) images. When using Set Clip, you’ll 
find that three tools appear as you move the cursor around an image. The tools are shown in 
Figure 15.13.
 FIGURE 15.13
The Scissors, Crop, and Move tools are used when setting a clip.
To crop an image, select the Set Clip command from a context menu opened from the TouchUp 
Object tool. The cursor immediately appears as the Scissors tool shown in Figure 15.14. This tool 
merely informs you that you are in Set Clip mode.
Move the cursor to one of the four handles you see on the four corners of the selected image. Place 
the cursor directly over one of the four handles. You may need to move the cursor around a bit or 
zoom into the document before you see the Crop tool shown in Figure 15.15. When you see the 
Crop tool, drag the corner in to crop the image. You can continue using the Crop tool as long as 
you don’t click when the cursor changes from the Crop tool to another tool.

anywhere on the page.

Now, let’s return to the Delete Clip command. After you have cropped an image, you can return to 
the full-size image before the cropping. Just open a context menu again with the TouchUp Object 
tool and select Delete Clip. The image appears as you first opened your PDF document.
Rotations
Images can be rotated in many ways by using the context menu commands from the TouchUp 
Object tool. Open a context menu and five separate commands appear for rotating images.
You can rotate images Horizontally and Vertically (180°), rotate Clockwise and Counterclockwise 
(90°), and rotate images using arbitrary rotations. The first four rotation options in the context 
menu should be self-evident. The more complicated rotation, Rotate Selection, requires a little 
explanation.
When you click an image with the TouchUp Object tool and choose Rotate Selection from the 
context menu, you won’t see any change appear in the Acrobat window. Invoking the command 
changes modes from a scaling mode to a transformation mode. After selecting the command, move 
the cursor to one of the four corner handles. You need to wait for the cursor to change appearance

Scaling images
You won’t find a menu command for scaling images in a context menu, but scaling images is avail-
able to you.
In Acrobat 9 you can easily scale images. Just select the TouchUp Object tool and click on an image. 
Move the cursor to a corner handle and drag the handle in or out to size an image down or up 
respectively. You can constrain proportions by pressing the Shift key and dragging a corner handle.
Create/Remove Artifact
This menu command is used when working with tagged PDF documents and accessibility. Selecting 
the command opens the Create Artifact dialog box. Or, if an artifact has been created, you can 
remove an artifact by selecting Remove Artifact.

The Color TouchUp Properties window provides you choices for converting color profiles. The 
current working color space is reported at the top of the dialog box. From choices in the Convert 
To pull-down menu, you can choose to convert color to a working space color or an output pro-
file. Ideally, you should stick to the working space profiles, and most often your choices will be 
either sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). Output profile selections can be made in the Advanced Print 
Options dialog box.
CROSS-REF

For more information on working with color workspaces and color output profiles, 
see Chapter 31.
If you want to change a color profile, make the choice for the new profile in the Convert To pull-
down menu, select a Rendering Intent, and click Convert Colors. If you want the profile embedded 
in the image, click the Embed Profile check box before clicking Convert Colors.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Be aware that if you embed a profile you need to make proper selections for print-
ing files in both the Acrobat Print dialog box and switches in your printer driver. Be 
certain to carefully read Chapter 31 before converting color on your images.
As a matter of default, you’ll want to keep the Rendering Intent at Relative Colorimetric. This choice 
is the best choice for raster image files. If you have vector images, you may want to use another 
rendering intent. For a comprehensive source on color management, see Color Correction For Digital 
Photographers Only (Wiley, 2006).
The item yet to be discussed in the context menu opened with the TouchUp Object tool is Edit 
Image. Selecting this command launches an external image-editing program, which is covered in 
the next section.
Image and Object External Editing
As demonstrated in the first part of this chapter, Acrobat offers you methods for copying and past-
ing images, moving them around the page, and exporting them to files. However, changing the 
physical attributes of images and shapes, other than transformations and scaling, is not something 
you can do in Acrobat. To modify certain appearances or attributes of raster and vector objects, you 
need to use an external editor. When you launch an editor from a menu command in Acrobat, 
you can make changes to images, text, and shapes and save your edits in the external editor. These 
saves are then dynamically updated in the PDF document. Acrobat treats external editing like many 
programs that support file links. When you edit linked files, the links are updated in the program 
where they are imported.
To access an external editor, you need to use the TouchUp Object tool. You cannot access external 
editors with any of the other selection tools.

507
Editing Images and Objects

TouchUp preferences
By default, Acrobat’s external editors are Adobe Photoshop for image editing and Adobe Illustrator 
for object editing if you have these programs installed on your computer. When you install Acrobat, 
the installer locates these editors on your hard drive, if they are installed, and designates them as the 
default editors. If you install Photoshop and/or Illustrator after Acrobat, you need to instruct Acrobat 
where to look for the application files to use as your image/object editors.
Choose Edit ➪ Preferences to open the Preferences dialog box. Click the TouchUp item on the left 
pane of the Preferences dialog box. In the right pane are two buttons, as shown in Figure 15.21. 
Click Choose Image Editor to open the Choose Image Editor dialog box. The dialog box enables 
you to navigate your hard drive and locate Adobe Photoshop. Select the Photoshop application 
icon and click Open.
For page and object editing, Adobe Illustrator is the default tool if installed. If you need to locate 
Illustrator, click the Choose Page/Object Editor button. Find the Illustrator application on your hard 
drive and select it in the Choose Page/Object Editor dialog box. Click Open and Adobe Illustrator 
is enabled as your page/object editor. If you happen to use another object editor such as CorelDraw, 
you need to browse your hard drive and designate CorelDraw for your object editor. The same 
holds true for any other type of object editor.
 FIGURE 15.21
Select TouchUp in the preferences list and the Choose buttons appear on the right side of the dialog box. 
Click one of the buttons to navigate your hard drive and select the respective editor.

508
Editing PDFs
Part III
After identifying your editors, click OK in the Preferences dialog box. The choices you made are 
immediately available. If Acrobat loses contact with either program, you are prompted in a dialog 
box that external editing cannot be done. If you see warning dialog boxes open as you attempt to 
use an external editor, return to the Preferences and reestablish the connection to your editors.
Editing images in Adobe Photoshop
You launch Photoshop from Acrobat by selecting an image with the TouchUp Object tool and open-
ing a context menu. From the menu commands, select Edit Image or press Control (Windows) or 
Option (Macintosh) and double-click. Depending on the speed of your computer and the amount 
of memory you have, Photoshop may take a few moments to launch. When the program opens, 
the image you selected is placed in a Photoshop document window.
You can change color modes and resolution, edit images for brightness and contrast, add effects, 
and just about anything else you can do in Photoshop to a single layer file. If you add type, add 
layers, or create transparency, you need to flatten all layers before saving the file. Layers added to 
a Photoshop file require you to use the Save As command to update the file. When you use Save 
As, the file is not updated in the PDF document. Flattening layers enables you to use the Save com-
mand that updates the PDF document when the file is saved. In Figure 15.22, a file in Photoshop 
was edited for color changes. Note that the file contains transparency and appears as a single-layer 
image. Because the file opened from Acrobat was a file on a single layer with transparency, all edits 
you make without creating additional layers enable you to still use the Save command.
 FIGURE 15.22
You edit files in your image editor and dynamically update the PDF from which they originated.

509
Editing Images and Objects
15
Photoshop updates the PDF document dynamically according to the edits you make with the Save 
command. If you add a layer to the file, you are prompted by Photoshop to Save As a new filename. 
Selecting Save As and writing to a new file disrupts the link. If you save in this manner, your PDF 
document won’t update. If the file is saved without writing a new file, the updates are dynamically 
recorded in the PDF when you return to Acrobat.
Editing objects in Adobe Illustrator
Objects, for the purposes of discussing external object editing, can be vector objects such as illus-
trations created in Illustrator, CorelDraw, or Adobe Freehand. Objects can also be text. Both vector 
objects and text are edited in Adobe Illustrator when you select Edit Object(s) from a context 
menu with the TouchUp Object tool.
To edit a single object, select the object with the TouchUp Object tool and open a context menu. 
The Edit Image command changes to Edit Object in the context menu. Select Edit Object and 
Adobe Illustrator launches. Changes you make to the object are dynamically updated when you 
save the file just as the file saves discussed with image editing are updated. If selecting a single 
object on the PDF page is difficult, you can marquee a group of objects and select Edit Objects.
If no object is selected and you open a context menu with the TouchUp Object tool, the menu com-
mand changes to Edit Page. To easily access the Edit Page command, you can also open a context 
menu outside the page boundary. When you click outside the page area, the Edit Page command 
appears in the context menu. Select Edit Page and all objects are opened in Adobe Illustrator.
Be certain to not use the Save As command when editing objects. The procedures for saving files with 
object editing follow the same principles as described with image editing. Regardless of whether 
you edit a single object, multiple objects, or the entire page, the edits you make in Illustrator are 
updated in the PDF document only when you choose File ➪ Save.
Editing text in Adobe Illustrator
In some circumstances you may find editing text in an external editor to prove more satisfactory than 
editing text with the TouchUp Text tool. Editing text in Illustrator requires you to have embedded 
fonts loaded on your computer. Keep in mind that returning to an authoring application to apply 
major edits to documents is more advantageous than using the TouchUp Text tool. But, for those 
jobs where you don’t have a document available and using the TouchUp Text tool just doesn’t do 
the job, here’s a little workaround you can try. I offer a disclaimer and tell you up front that these 
methods may not always work, but I’ve found more often than not that you can successfully edit 
text in Illustrator for some minor edit jobs.
One problem you can face when editing text in Illustrator is the text blocks are likely to be broken 
up and lose their paragraph formatting attributes. You need to select the text, cut it from the page, 
and paste it back, keeping the general size and position close to the original. You can then edit the 
text and choose File ➪ Save to update the PDF document.

510

Part III
Using Edit Page in Adobe Illustrator
If you want to edit an entire page in Illustrator, click the TouchUp Object tool on a document page 
without selecting an image. Open a context menu and select Edit Page. The entire page then opens 
in Adobe Illustrator.
NOTE
NOTE
If you choose Edit Objects to open text in an object editor and the PDF file was cre-
ated as a tagged PDF, a dialog box opens, informing you that the tags will be removed 
from the document if you proceed. Click Yes in the dialog box and the tags are removed from 
the document and the selected objects open in your object editor.
You can also click the TouchUp Object tool and choose Edit ➪ Select All or press Ctrl/Ô+A. All 
objects and their respective bounding boxes are shown as selected. Open a context menu and 
choose Edit Objects. All the selected objects are then opened in Adobe Illustrator.
If you edit a page or all objects on a page in Illustrator, selecting File ➪ Save (Ctrl/Ô+S) updates 
the PDF document. If working on a single PDF page, you can just as easily select File ➪ Save As in 
Illustrator and save to a PDF file.
If you need to completely rework a PDF document, you can also open a PDF in Adobe Illustrator. 
Opening a file in Illustrator is the same as selecting Edit Page. All changes you make are dynami-
cally updated in the PDF document after saving in Illustrator.

TIP
TIP
If you want to edit a page in Adobe Illustrator, you can alternately open the page 
in Acrobat and choose Document ➪ Extract Pages. Extract the page to edit and save 
as a new file name. The PDF can be opened in Adobe Illustrator, edited, and saved. When you 
return to Acrobat, choose Document ➪ Replace Pages and replace the page you extracted with 
the page you edited in Adobe Illustrator.
Using the Snapshot Tool
 
 You use the Snapshot tool to create a marquee around any area on the document page. You can 
select text and graphics with the Snapshot tool. Select the tool from the Select & Zoom toolbar 
and click and drag a marquee around the area to be selected. When you release the mouse button, 
Acrobat takes a snapshot of the area within the marquee and copies it to the Clipboard. A dialog 
box opens to inform you the data has been copied to the Clipboard.
After you click OK in the Alert dialog box, the marquee is still active on the document page. You 
can open a context menu where you have options for copying the data or printing the selection. In 
addition, you can create a link to the snapshot by selecting Create Link in the context menu. These 
menu commands are the same as those shown in Figure 15.7 earlier in this chapter.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on creating links from snapshots, see Chapter 22.

511
Editing Images and Objects
15
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Taking a snapshot of a page containing images and text or just text creates only a 
bitmap of the selected area. All text is converted to a raster image. If you intend to 
preserve text and edit it later, don’t use the Snapshot tool. The text is not editable from snapshot 
images.
The Snapshot tool provides paste functions equal to both the Select tool and the TouchUp Object 
tool. Once you take a snapshot you can paste the data back to the PDF document or to another 
application document. By default, the Snapshot tool places a copy of the snapshot on the Clipboard 
and makes the Clipboard data available to Acrobat. When you open a context menu on the snap-
shot and select Copy Selected Graphic, you can paste the data to other application documents.
Changing snapshot resolutions
By default, snapshot resolutions are 72 ppi (pixels per inch), which is sufficient for screen views at 
100 percent. If you want to print files or zoom in to a document view above 100 percent, 72 ppi is 
not sufficient for rendering images that appear without obvious image degradation.
To understand how image resolutions affect image quality, try the following steps.
STEPS: Changing snapshot image resolutions
 
1. Change Preferences. Open the Preferences dialog box by pressing Ctrl/Ô+K. Click 
General in the left pane and check the box for Use system setting. The system setting has 
a fixed resolution of 96 ppi, as shown in Figure 15.23.
 FIGURE 15.23
Set the resolution for snapshots to 72 ppi.
 
2. Take a snapshot. Open a file in Acrobat — preferably one with images and image reso-
lutions above 200 ppi.
 
 Click the Snapshot tool. Drag a rectangle around the area you want to copy. When you 
release the mouse button, the data is copied to the Clipboard.
 
3. Paste the data in an image editor. Open an image editor such as Adobe Photoshop CS 
or Adobe Photoshop Elements. Paste the data in a new document window.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on pasting data in an image editor, see the next section, “Pasting 
snapshot data.”
 
4. Zoom in on the document. Zoom to at least a 200 percent view and notice the quality 
of the image. You should see poor image quality especially if you copy any text. In Figure 
15.24, the pasted data includes both image and text.

512
Editing PDFs
Part III
 FIGURE 15.24
Zoom to a 200 percent view after pasting the data in an image editor.
 
5. Change preferences. Return to the Acrobat Preferences dialog box as described in Step 1. 
Change the image resolution to 300 ppi.
 
6. Take a Snapshot. Try to take a snapshot as described in Step 2 in the same area of the 
PDF document as you took the first snapshot.
 
7. Paste the data. Paste the new Clipboard data in your image editor and zoom to the 
approximate same view as the first image you pasted in your image editor. Because the 
image resolution is much higher, the zoom will be much lower than a 200 percent view.
 
8. Compare the two images. Examine the second image you pasted at 300 ppi. You should 
see a noticeable difference in image quality. In Figure 15.24, compare the text with the 
text shown in Figure 15.25.
Note that boosting image resolution in the Preferences won’t help create better-looking images than 
a value higher than the original image resolution. For example, if you convert to PDF using images 
at 72 ppi and try to take a snapshot at 300 ppi, you can’t produce a better-looking image. The 
image file is interpolated as you size it up just like sizing up images in image editing programs.

513

 FIGURE 15.25

Pasting snapshot data
When you take a snapshot and paste the data in Acrobat, the pasted data becomes a Stamp com-
ment just like using the Select tool. If you want to take a snapshot and paste as you can paste data 
using the TouchUp Object tool, you need to perform two operations.
First use the Snapshot tool to copy the area you want on a PDF page. When the data are copied, 
choose the Create PDF From Clipboard command. A new PDF document is created from your 
snapshot.
If you now want to copy and paste the data, you can use the TouchUp Object tool, click the page, 
and copy the data. The copied data can then be pasted into any PDF file.
You can also paste snapshot data into other programs. If you use the Select tool to copy an image, 
the image is pasted at 72 ppi in another application. If using the Snapshot tool, you can adjust res-
olution and paste into another application document. Again, you need to have sufficient resolution 
in the original image to make this method worthwhile.

Exporting Images
If you need to completely overhaul a document and want to lay it out in an authoring program, you 
might want to copy and paste text into a word processor, format your text, save the file, and then 
import the text into a program best suited for layout design, such as Adobe InDesign CS. If your 
PDF document contains photo images, you need to export the images and add them to your lay-
out. Having to individually export images with the Select Image tool would be tedious for a large 
layout project containing many images. Fortunately, Acrobat offers you a feature for exporting all 
images in a PDF with a single menu command.
Choose Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Export All Images. The Export All Images As dialog 
box opens where you can make selections for filename, destination, and the format you want to 
use for the exported images. In the Export All Images As dialog box, open the pull-down menu for 
Save as type (Windows) or Format (Macintosh). Four format options are available from the menu 
choices — JPEG, PNG, TIFF, or JPEG2000. Select one of the format options and click the Settings 
button to assign file attributes to the exported images.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on image file format definitions, see Chapter 10.
When you select JPEG for the file type and click the Settings button, the Export All Images As JPEG 
Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 15.26. The settings change according to the file type 
you select. Therefore, if you choose TIFF as a format, for example, you’ll see changes for compres-
sion choices. The options for File Settings and Color Management are the same as those options 
discussed in Chapters 10 and 11. In addition to these settings, the Extraction item at the bottom 
of the dialog box enables you to eliminate certain files when the sizes are smaller than the size you 
choose from the pull-down menu.
From the pull-down menu, you choose a preset option for an image’s physical size. You might 
have icons or logos appearing on all pages constructed at .75-inch sizes. You can elect to exclude 
these images by selecting the 1.00 inches item in the pull-down menu. When you click OK in the 
Extract All Images As dialog box, all files above the size selected from the pull-down menu choice 
are saved as separate files in the specified format. If you want every image extracted, choose the No 
Limit item from the pull-down menu.

hapters 13 and 15 covered editing content on PDF pages. Minor 
edits for text passages and images may be completed with the tools 
discussed in the earlier chapters. If you want to modify larger por-
tions of a PDF document, then you’ll want to know something about the tools 
Acrobat offers you for page editing. If you return to an authoring application 
and edit text, graphics, and layouts, you may want to update your PDF doc-
ument according to the page edits made in other applications. Rather than 
re-create the entire PDF file, Acrobat enables you to selectively append, 
replace, delete, and extract pages in a PDF document.
In addition to the number of different page-editing tools found in earlier 
versions of Acrobat, the new version of Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended offers 
some impressive features in the new revised Add Headers and Footers dialog 
box and the ability to add backgrounds and watermarks. This chapter covers 
the page-editing tools in Acrobat and many new features that can help you 
modify documents.
Setting Up the Page-Editing

Working with Page Thumbnails
Thumbnails are mini-views of PDF pages that can be displayed in various zoom sizes. To see the 
thumbnail view of pages in an open document, click the Pages panel to open the pane, as shown in 
Figure 16.2. Thumbnail views are created on-the-fly when the pane is opened. Users of Acrobat 5 
and below will remember the pane was referred to as Thumbnails. In Acrobat 6.0 viewers, the name 
was changed to the Pages panel and remains the same in Acrobat 7 through 9.
Navigating pages
The Pages panel can be used to navigate pages. Clicking a thumbnail takes you to the page associ-
ated with the thumbnail. The page opens in the Document pane at the currently established zoom 
view. You can zoom in or out of pages in the Pages panel by dragging the lower right handle on 
the rectangle appearing inside the page thumbnail. The changing zoom levels are reflected in the 
zoom view in the Document pane. In Figure 16.3, a rectangle shows the current page view in the 
Document pane. Click on the handle in the lower right corner and drag it into the center of the 
rectangle to zoom in on the page. Click and drag out to zoom out of the page.
The Pages panel and the Document pane are two separate compartments in the open PDF docu-
ment. Clicking in the Pages panel activates the pane. Conversely, clicking in the Document pane 
activates the area where you view pages. Unfortunately, Acrobat does not highlight any part of 
either pane to inform you when a pane is active. So you just have to remember to click first in the 
area you want to be active.

If you press the Page Down key or Down Arrow key while the Document pane is active, the pages 
in the Document pane scroll. As each page is scrolled, the Pages panel likewise scrolls pages and 
the respective page thumbnails are highlighted. When you click in the Pages panel, you experience 
a different behavior. Pressing the Page Down key scrolls several pages down only in the Pages panel. 
The respective pages in the Document pane are not scrolled. As you scroll through page thumbnails 
in the Pages panel, the Document pane remains fixed at its current view because as you scroll in the 
Pages panel, thumbnails are not actually selected. Instead, the selected thumbnail is linked to the 
view in the Document pane.
With reference to thumbnails, the term “selection” needs a little definition. When you click a page thumb-
nail, the number appearing below the page icon is shown selected (highlighted), and the thumbnail is 
further highlighted with a keyline border around the icon. Likewise, the respective page is placed in 
view in the Document pane. In essence, Acrobat communicates two selection messages to you. If you 
press the Down Arrow key on your keyboard, the page remains open in the Document pane. However, 
the page number highlight and keyline border move to the next page down, indicating the current 
thumbnail selection in the Pages panel. In Figure 16.4, page 9 in a PDF document is selected and 
page 9 is open in the Document pane. When the Down Arrow key is pressed twice, page 11 becomes 
selected in the Pages panel, while page 9 remains as the page viewed in the Document pane.
 FIGURE 16.4
Click the cursor in the Pages panel to activate the pane, and then press the Down Arrow key. The keyline 
border shows the page selection in the Pages panel, while the highlighted page number on the previous 
page shows which page is in view in the Document pane.

Moving Around Pages and Page Thumbnails
A 
nice new feature added in Acrobat 9 for quick thumbnail and page navigation is provided via a 
new context menu. If you position the mouse cursor between the scrollbar arrows in the Pages 
panel or on the far right scrollbar in the Document pane, a context menu opens offering you several 
options for navigating thumbnails/pages. Click Scroll Here to move a thumbnail/page and the 
thumbnail/page at the cursor position jumps into view. For example, if you open the Pages panel 
and position the cursor in the middle of a 500-page document, the thumbnail/page jumps to page 
250 (or approximately the midpoint in the document).
Other nice features in the menu include Top and Bottom. If you want to jump to the beginning of the 
document, choose Top. If you want to jump to the end of the document, choose Bottom. The con-
text menus operate independently so you can use the Bottom command in the Pages panel while the 
Document pane displays the first page in your document. The Pages panel jumps to the end of the 
document while the Document pane continues to display the first page.

Changing thumbnail sizes
In Acrobat 6 and later, you can reduce the size of pages to a mini-thumbnail view and enlarge the 
size up to a maximum thumbnail view of about 300 percent. The support for increased thumbnail 
views in the Pages panel enables you to quickly find a page in a PDF document.
You reduce or enlarge page thumbnail sizes through menu commands. A context menu opened in 
the Pages panel or the pane pull-down menu includes the Enlarge Page Thumbnails and Reduce 
Page Thumbnails commands. Before using these commands, you should understand opening 
context menus.
If you click in the Pages panel on a page thumbnail and open a context menu, the Enlarge Page 
Thumbnails and Reduce Page Thumbnails commands are available as options in a menu that con-
tains many different commands for page editing. Likewise, the pull-down menu adjacent to the top 
left of the Pages panel offers the same commands. Regardless of which menu you use, you can 
enlarge or reduce page thumbnail views.
To enlarge the size of the page thumbnails, click the mouse button anywhere inside the Pages panel 
and open a context menu. Select Enlarge Page Thumbnails from the menu options, as shown in 
Figure 16.5. Return to the menu and select the same menu command to enlarge again. Repeat the 
steps to zoom in to the desired view.

anywhere on the vertical bar on the right side of the pane and drag it to the right. The panel 
resizes horizontally to show more of the Pages panel while the Document pane is reduced in size. 
In Figure 16.6, I enlarged the thumbnail view, using repeated steps for enlarging the thumbnails, 
and I widened the panel so several large thumbnails could be viewed. The tiny thumbnail on the 
right side of Figure 16.6 shows the selected page in the Document pane.

To size the Pages panel, click on the vertical bar on the right side of the pane and drag it to the right.
Embedding and unembedding thumbnails
Page thumbnails are created on-the-fly each time you open the Pages panel. In long documents, 
you may find your computer slowing down each time the Pages panel is opened and the thumb-
nails are recreated. If this proves to be a burden, you can choose to embed thumbnails when work-
ing with the Pages panel and avoid the delay caused by creating them.
Thumbnails add some overhead to your file. Each page thumbnail adds about 1K to the file size. 
Unless your files are to be viewed by users of earlier Acrobat viewers that don’t support creating 
thumbnails on-the-fly, delete them as one of the final steps in your editing session.
To embed thumbnails, select the Embed All Page Thumbnails command from the pane Options 
menu or a context-sensitive menu. Thumbnails can also be created by batch-processing PDF files 
using a Batch Sequence or at the time of distillation when using Acrobat Distiller.

Part III
PDF WORKFLOW
PDF WORKFLOW You can delete thumbnails from PDF documents either individually in Acrobat or 
by using the Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Batch Processing command in 
Acrobat Professional. If your work environment is such that you do a lot of editing in Acrobat 
and often use thumbnails, you may want to create them during distillation. When thumbnails 
are embedded, screen refreshes for multiple edits in long documents are faster. After you finish 
editing jobs and want to post PDF files on the Web or create CD-ROMs, you can batch-process 
the files for optimization and delete the thumbnails. Run the Edit Batch Sequences command to 
optimize multiple files and remove thumbnails.

For information on creating and running batch sequences, see Chapter 18.
To unembed thumbnails, open a context menu on a page thumbnail and select Remove Embedded 
Page Thumbnails. All embedded page thumbnails are removed from the document. This step can 
be particularly helpful when working with Adobe Illustrator files, including the most current ver-
sion of Adobe Illustrator CS and Acrobat 7 or less. When Illustrator embeds thumbnails, a bitmap 
representation of the page is created as a thumbnail and the thumbnail appearance is a poorly 
degraded image, as you can see on the left side of Figure 16.7. After the thumbnail is removed 
in Acrobat, the page thumbnail appears as you see it on the right side of Figure 16.7. Whenever 
you see thumbnail images with a degraded view, always check to see whether the thumbnail is 
embedded.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
In Acrobat 9, the rendering of vector art embedded thumbnails has been improved. 
If you open the file shown in Figure 16.7 in Acrobat 9 and view the thumbnails, you 
see the thumbnail image on the right without having a need to unembed the thumbnails.
 FIGURE 16.7

Organizing Pages
The Pages panel offers you a wealth of opportunity for sorting pages and reorganizing them. You 
can move pages around, copy and paste pages when you want to duplicate them, delete pages, 
print selected pages within a document, and a host of other options specific to page management.
Reordering pages
Acrobat provides you with a marvelous slide sorter where you can shuffle pages and reorder them 
in a page sequence suited to your needs. Now with an opportunity to view page thumbnails in 
much larger views, you can easily see the content of text-only pages when no visible icons or 
graphics are present to distinguish differences in page content. Reorganizing pages in earlier ver-
sions of Acrobat was a little more difficult because of having to view text pages in small thumbnail 
views; however, now you can manage page order more easily by zooming in on pages to clearly 
view the content.
To rearrange pages in a PDF document, open the Pages panel to the full width of your monitor by 
dragging the right side of the pane to the far right of the Document pane. Open a context menu in 
the Pages panel and select Enlarge Page Thumbnails. Repeat the steps to enlarge the thumbnail 
views to a size that enables you to read text comfortably on the pages.
Click on a page and drag the page to a spot between the pages where you want to relocate the selected 
page. When you move a page around the Pages panel, a vertical bar appears where the page will be 
located. If the highlight bar is positioned in the area where you want to relocate a page, release the 
mouse button. Figure 16.8 shows page 7 selected. The page is moved to the area after page 3. 
Notice the vertical highlight bar appearing to the right side of page 3.
TIP
TIP
If you want to move pages between pages not in view in the Pages tab, click and 
drag a selected page up or down in the Pages panel and the screen automatically 
scrolls to reveal hidden pages when the cursor is at the top or bottom of the panel. Keep the 
mouse button depressed until you find the location where you want to move a page.
To select multiple pages, click a page to select it. Hold down the Control/Ô key and click another 
page. If you want to select a block of contiguous pages, click the first page to be selected, hold 
down the Shift key, and click the last page within the group. All pages between the two selected 
pages are included in the selection. After you make your selection, click one of the selected pages 
and drag to a new location to reorder the pages.
TIP
TIP
For a super slide sorter, open the Pages panel and view thumbnails in a large size. 
Place the mouse cursor over the vertical bar to the right of the Pages panel and drag 
to the right of your monitor screen. Press the F8 and F9 keys to hide the menu bar and toolbars. 
Resize the viewing window to fit the screen size. You’ll get as much real estate on your monitor 
as possible. Shuffling pages is much easier in Acrobat than in almost any other program.

 FIGURE 16.8
To move a page in a PDF document, click a thumbnail and drag it to the area where you want to relocate 
the page. When you see a vertical highlight bar appear in the desired location, release the mouse button.
Copying pages
You can copy and paste pages within a PDF document or from one open PDF document to another. 
To copy a page with thumbnails, hold down the Ctrl/Option key as you drag a page to a new loca-
tion in the same PDF file. Release the mouse button when you see the vertical highlight bar appear 
at the desired location. To copy a page from one PDF to another, open both PDF files and view 
them tiled either vertically or horizontally. The Pages panel must be in view on both PDF docu-
ments. Click and drag the thumbnail from one file to the Pages panel in the other document. The 
vertical highlight bar appears and the cursor changes, as shown in Figure 16.9. After the vertical 
bar is positioned at the desired location, release the mouse button, and the page drops into position.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
To learn how to tile PDF documents, see Chapter 5.
Removing pages
The previous example behaves like a copy-and-paste sequence. You can also create a cut-and-paste 
action whereby the page is deleted from one PDF document and copied to another. To remove a 
page and place it in another PDF file, hold the down Ctrl/Option key and then click-and-drag the 
page to another Pages panel in another file. The page is deleted from the original file and copied to 
the second file.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Be certain not to confuse the shortcut keys. If Control/Option is used in the page 
thumbnails on one document with click and drag, the page is copied. If using the 
same keys between two documents, the page is deleted from the file of origin and copied to 
the destination file.

 FIGURE 16.9
Dragging a thumbnail to a new location or copying between documents displays a vertical highlight bar 
where the page is placed.
To delete a page with the Pages panel, use a context-sensitive menu or the panel Options pull-down 
menu. Select a single thumbnail or Shift+click to select multiple thumbnails in a contiguous order 
(Ctrl/Ô+click for a noncontiguous order), and select Delete Pages from the context menu. This 
command opens the Delete Pages dialog box, as shown in Figure 16.10.
 FIGURE 16.10
When you select Delete Pages from the Pages context menu, the Delete Pages dialog box opens. Click OK

Editing PDFs
Part III
In the Delete Pages dialog box, by default the selected page is marked for deletion. You can make 
a change in the dialog box by selecting the From button and entering a contiguous page number 
range in the field box. The Selected radio button deletes all pages selected in the Pages panel. You 
can click and select pages in a contiguous or noncontiguous group. After you select the pages 
you want to delete, click OK. The selected pages are deleted from the document.
Modifying Pages
In this context, modifying pages refers to the PDF page in its entirety and not individual page ele-
ments. Rather than look at changing single items on a page, such as text and graphics, this section 
examines some of the features for structuring pages as an extension of the commands found in the 
Pages panel. Page editing discussed here relates to the insertion, extraction, and replacement of 
PDF pages.
NOTE
NOTE
Most of the page-editing commands you have available in a context menu opened 
on a page thumbnail also appear in the Document menu. The commands for Insert 
Pages, Extract Pages, Replace Pages, Delete Pages, Crop Pages, and Rotate Pages appear in both 
menus.
Before you go about creating a huge PDF document with links and buttons, understanding how 
Acrobat structures a page and related links is imperative. Bookmarks and other links are often cre-
ated within a PDF document as user-defined navigation. Acrobat handles thumbnails and the link 
to the respective pages without user intervention. You have no control over the links from a 
thumbnail to respective pages.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on creating bookmarks and links, see Chapter 22.
With regard to links and bookmarks, think of Acrobat as having a background and an overlay — 
the navigation items are placed on the overlay and page content is placed on the background (or 
layers in a PDF having Adobe PDF Layers). In regard to a single-layer PDF document, links appear 
as if on an overlay over the background. When viewing a PDF file, you don’t see the navigation 
items independent of page content. This said, when you delete a page, all the links to the page are 
lost. Acrobat makes no provision to go to the page that follows a deleted page when links are 
deleted. Therefore, if you set up a bookmark to page 4 and later delete page 4, the bookmark has 
no place to go. Such links are commonly referred to as dead links.
When editing pages in Acrobat, you can choose to insert a page, delete a page, extract a page, and 
replace a page. If you understand the page structure, you’ll know which option is right for your sit-
uation. Choices described in the Pages panel Options menu permit access to each of the following 
choices by enabling you to select commands from the Document menu, or by providing a context-
sensitive menu (refer to Figure 16.7) while clicking a thumbnail in the Pages panel.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
The menu commands for page editing are available only when you work with PDF 
documents that are not password protected, which prohibits page editing. If you 
attempt to edit pages in a secure PDF document, Acrobat prompts you for a password if the file 
is password protected. This behavior applies to all the options listed here.

529
Editing Pages
16
The page-editing options available either in a context menu opened on a page thumbnail, from the 
Pages panel Options menu, or from the Document menu commands include the following:
 Insert Pages From File. When you select this option, the Select File to Insert dialog box 
opens. Select a file to insert, and click the Select button in the dialog box. The Insert Pages 
dialog box opens next, enabling you to choose the location for the insertion regardless of 
the current page viewed (see Figure 16.11). You can choose to insert a page either before 
or after the page in view, within a page range, or before or after the first or last page. 
Inserted pages do not affect any links in your document. All the pages shift left or right, 
depending on whether you select the Before or After option.
 FIGURE 16.11
The Insert Pages dialog box enables you to locate the page that precedes or follows 
another page for the target location.
TIP
TIP
You can also insert pages via drag-and-drop actions. Select a file from the Desktop 
or a folder and drag the file to the Pages panel at the location where you want to 
insert a page. You can use any file type that Acrobat can convert to PDF. For example, drag a 
Microsoft Word or PowerPoint file to the Pages panel and the file is converted to PDF and 
inserted as new pages in the existing document.
 Insert Pages From Clipboard. When you copy data using a screen shot (Windows), 
the Snapshot tool, or data from other applications, the data is stored on the Clipboard. 
In Acrobat, you can convert the Clipboard data to a PDF document using the PDF 
from Clipboard command in the Create task button pull-down menu or by choosing 
File ➪ Create PDF ➪ From Clipboard.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
In Acrobat 9 you can choose Insert Pages from a context menu, from the Pages 
panel Options menu, or from the Document menu; a submenu opens providing 
you two choices. The first choice opens the dialog box shown in Figure 16.11 where you can 
insert a page from a file. The second choice is to insert a page From Clipboard.

530
Editing PDFs
Part III
 
Choosing the From Clipboard option opens the same dialog box shown in Figure 16.11. 
The Clipboard content is inserted at the location you specify in the Insert Pages dialog box.
 Delete Pages. When you delete a page, you delete not only its contents but also its links. 
If a link or bookmark is linked to a view in the deleted page, all links to the page become 
inoperable. When creating a presentation in Acrobat with multiple pages, you must exer-
cise care when deleting pages to be certain links aren’t broken.
 
Select a single thumbnail or multiple thumbnails in the Pages panel. Pages can be selected 
in a contiguous or noncontiguous selection. Open a context menu, the Options pull-down 
menu, or the Document menu and select the Delete Pages command. The Delete Pages 
dialog box opens where you can delete the selected pages by leaving the default Selected 
radio button active or by selecting a page range and clicking OK.
 
Acrobat opens a warning dialog box to confirm your choice. If you change your mind 
and want to keep the pages, click the Cancel button. To continue with the page deletion, 
click OK.
TIP
TIP
If you begin an editing session and work on files where you insert and delete pages 
frequently, you may find the confirmation dialog box annoying. To eliminate the 
dialog box opening every time you delete a page, open the Preferences dialog box (Ctrl/Ô+K). 
Click General in the left pane and select the box for Do not show edit warnings in the right pane. 
When you return to the Document pane, all subsequent page deletions are performed without 
the warning dialog box opening. Be certain to exercise care when targeting pages for deletion if 
you are not using the edit warnings. When you want to bring back the edit warnings, open the 
General preferences and click Reset All Warnings.
 Extract Pages. Extracting a page is like pulling out single or multiple pages and creating 
a new PDF file with them. Extracting pages has no effect on bookmarks or links for the 
destination pages in the original document unless you delete pages when extracting them. 
All links are operable for pages among the extracted pages. For example, if you extract 
ten pages with bookmarks to each page, all the bookmarks within the extracted pages are 
functional in the new file. If you have a bookmark to a page not part of the extraction, the 
link is not operational.
 
When you select the Extract Pages command, the Extract Pages dialog box opens, as shown 
in Figure 16.12. You supply the page range in the From/To field boxes, and check boxes 
exist for Delete Pages After Extracting and Extract Pages As Separate Files. You can select 
these two options individually or together when extracting pages.
 
Pages are extracted and deleted from the original file when you select Extract Pages and you 
check the box for Delete Pages After Extracting. The new pages open in the foreground as a 
single PDF document and remain unsaved until you use the Save or Save As command.
 
The other option you have in the Extract Pages dialog box is Extract Pages As Separate 
Files. Check this box to extract pages and save them to your hard drive instead of having 
them open in the Document pane. When you select the page range and click OK after 
checking the box to create separate files, a Browse For Folder dialog box opens, enabling 
you to select a target folder for the saved files. Check the box for Delete Pages After 
Extracting and pages are deleted from the original file after the new files are saved. Each 
page you select for extraction is saved as a separate file.

531
Editing Pages

 FIGURE 16.12
If you want to delete the pages extracted from the original file, check the box for Delete 
Pages After Extracting. Checking the box for Extract Pages As Separate Files saves each 
page as a separate PDF to your hard drive.
  Replace Pages. This option affects only the contents of a PDF page — the overlay is unaf-
fected. If you have links going to or from the replaced page, all links or interactive content 
is preserved. When editing PDF documents where page contents need to be changed, 
redistilled, and inserted in the final document, always use the Replace Pages command.
 
Replace Pages is particularly helpful when recreating Acrobat PDF forms. If you create a 
form in an authoring program and add all the form fields in Acrobat, and then later decide 
you want to edit the form design, replacing the old design with a new design preserves 
the form fields.
 
You can click a single page thumbnail or select multiple pages in a contiguous order and 
open a context menu. Select Replace Pages to open the Select File With New Pages dialog 
box. Navigate to the file containing pages that are to replace pages in the open file, and 
click Select.
 
The Replace Pages dialog box opens. In the Original area of the dialog box shown in 
Figure 16.13, you select the page range in the open document for the target pages to be 
replaced. In the Replacement section of the Replace Pages dialog box, you select the first 
page number of the document selected in the Select Pages to Replace dialog box. The 
readout to the right of the field box automatically displays the range of pages that are 
targeted for replacement. At the bottom of each section, notice the filename listed for 
the open document and the selected document.
 
If you disabled the edit warnings, the pages are replaced according to the selection made 
in the Replace Pages dialog box. If the edit warnings are not disabled (in this case, the 
check box isn’t selected in the General preferences dialog box), a confirmation dialog box 
opens. Click OK to replace the pages.
TIP
TIP
You can replace pages through drag-and-drop operations when viewing two docu-
ments in tiled views and when the Pages panel is opened for both documents. 
When you drag a page or a number of selected pages, hold down Ctrl+Alt (Windows) or 
Ô+Option (Macintosh) and move the cursor in the target document on top of the page thumb-
nail for the first page to be replaced. Rather than place the cursor between pages where the 
highlight bar is shown, be certain to drop the selection on top of the page number. The target 
page is highlighted in black when the cursor appears directly over the page number. Release the 
mouse button and the pages are replaced.

Appending Pages to PDF Documents
I
f you want to create a PDF document by combining multiple files that may have been created 
from multiple authors and multiple authoring programs, you can choose some alternatives in 
Acrobat that permit you to concatenate files to form a single PDF document.
When you use the Insert Pages command, the Select File to Insert dialog box enables you to select 
multiple files stored in a single folder. You can select multiple files by holding down the Shift key 
and clicking on the target files in a listed order from within a folder, or pressing the Ctrl/Ô key to 
select files in a noncontiguous order.
However, when you use the Insert Pages command, the order of the files is appended to the open 
PDF file, which does not follow the same file order you viewed in the list in the Select File to Insert 
dialog box. You have no control over rearranging the order or selecting additional files from within 
separate folders. Additionally, you can’t add PDFs having security, forms created in Adobe Designer, 
or digital signatures. You can’t retain form field data in multiple PDF forms having identical form 
data field attributes.
A much better alternative to use when appending pages is the Combine Files task button, and in 
some cases the new Assemble Files into a Portfolio option. Combining files permits you to establish 
the page order for the files you combine into one PDF document. It also enables you to choose spe-
cific pages within each PDF to add to a single PDF document. The Assemble Files into a Portfolio 
option permits you to assemble files into one document when you need to add PDFs having security 
or digital signatures, PDF forms created in Adobe LiveCycle Designer, or when aggregating forms 
among files having identical field names.
To review a thorough coverage on combining files using the Combine Files task button and the new 
Acrobat 9 features for creating PDF Portfolios, see Chapter 12. For a complete description on merg-
ing multiple emails together in a Portfolio, see Chapter 8.

You can approach page editing in Acrobat in many ways. Using the Pages panel helps you access 
menu commands quickly. You can also access the commands just discussed with the Pages panel 
collapsed by choosing the commands from the Document menu. In addition, you can open multi-
ple documents, view them with horizontal or vertical tiling, and drag-and-drop pages to accom-
plish the same results. To help in understanding how page editing with tiled views is 
accomplished, try following these steps for a little practice.
STEPS: Editing pages with thumbnails
 
1. Open two PDF documents where pages need to be arranged in a third document. As 
an example for page editing, assume you have two files that need selected pages merged 
in a new, third file. Some of the pages need only to be copied to the new file and some 
pages need to be copied and deleted from the source document.
 
2. Create a new blank page. Select File ➪ Create PDF ➪ From Blank Page.
 
3. Tile the page views. Choose Window ➪ Tile ➪ Vertically (or Ctrl/Ô+Shift+L). Click the 
Pages panel in each file to open the panes. The two files you opened and the new file you 
created should appear similar to Figure 16.14.
 
4. Replace a page. The new document you created contains a blank page. One of the cover 
pages in the opened files is used as the cover in the new document. Select a page from 
one of the open document’s Pages panel and press Ctrl+Alt (Windows) or Ô+Option 
(Macintosh) and drag the page to the top of the page thumbnail in the new document. 
When the page is targeted for replacement, the entire page is highlighted in black, as 
shown in Figure 16.14.
 FIGURE 16.14
The two opened files and the new file appear with the Pages panels open. Drag a 
thumbnail image to the target file and place the cursor on top of the page number. 
Release the mouse button when the page turns black.

534
Editing PDFs
Part III
 
5. Insert pages. Select a page in one of the open documents. Press the Ctrl/Ô key and click 
on pages in a noncontiguous order. Release the modifier key and drag one of the selected 
pages below the title page in the new document. Wait until you see a highlight bar 
appearing below the page before releasing the mouse button.
 
6. Extract pages with deletion. Move to the second open file. In this document you copy 
pages to the new document while deleting them from the source document. Click on a 
contiguous or noncontiguous group of pages to select them. Press the Ctrl/Option key 
and drag the pages to the new document’s Pages panel. Pages are inserted in the new file 
and deleted from the source document.
 
7. Close the original source documents. Click the close button or choose File ➪ Close to 
close the documents. If you want to save the file where you extracted and deleted pages, 
save the document and close the file.
 
8. Sort the pages. Open the Pages panel by dragging the right side of the pane to the right 
side of the Acrobat window. Open a context menu and select Enlarge Page Thumbnails. 
Repeat the steps to enlarge pages until you have a comfortable view of the page content. 
Click and drag pages around the Pages panel to reorder the pages, as shown in Figure 16.15.
 
9. Save the file. Choose File ➪ Save As. Supply a filename and select a destination in the 
Save As dialog box. Click the Save button.
 FIGURE 16.15
Open the Pages panel and move the pages to the desired order.

Save your work periodically if you have a major editing job. When you create a new file with the 
Create PDF ➪ From Blank Page command, Acrobat creates a new Untitled document, but the file 
is not actually saved to disk until you save the file. Save the file after a few edits; then repeat the 
Save command as you work on the file. When you finish the job, choose File ➪ Save As and rewrite 
the file. Page editing can add a lot of unnecessary data to a file during an editing job. When you 
rewrite the file, much of the redundancy is eliminated and the file size is reduced.

For information on rewriting files with the Save As command, see Chapter 11.
Splitting Documents
In the “Extract Pages” section of this chapter I talked about pulling out pages in a PDF document 
that you can save as new PDF files. The Extract Pages command works fine for documents where 
you need to save a few pages here and there as new PDF files. But what if you have a book — a 
lengthy book — and you want to divide the book into individual chapters all saved as individual 
PDF documents? Using the Extract Pages command is going to take you a bit of time if you’re 
working on a book with 20 or more chapters. There must be a better way.
NEW FEATURE

Fortunately, Acrobat 9 makes the task of splitting up a document and saving the 
split parts into individual PDF files a simple feat. New in Acrobat 9 you find the

To split a document choose Split Document from the Document menu and the Split Document 
dialog box opens as shown in Figure 16.16. The Split Document dialog box offers you three options 
for choosing how to split a PDF document into several files.

 File name. Three radio button options are available to you. Choose to use the bookmark 
names for the file names, add a label and number before a file name such as Part and 
Acrobat automatically adds a number after the label beginning with 1, or add the label 
and number after the original name.
 Use Label. If you choose to add a label before or after the original file name, type the 
label in the text box here.
 Use separator between original name and label. Type a separator character in the text 
box such as an underscore if you want a separator to appear between the original file 
name and the label.
 Do not overwrite existing files. Use this option if you choose to save files to the same 
folder as the original files and you want to prevent overwriting the existing files.
All the options for splitting files can be applied to a single document, or you can either use the 
Apply to Multiple button in the Split Document dialog box or a batch sequence to split a folder 
of files.

Cropping Pages
 
 In the Advanced Editing toolbar, you find the Crop tool. Cropping pages in Acrobat is performed 
with the Crop tool, Document ➪ Crop Pages, the Crop tool on the Print Production toolbar, or by 
selecting a menu command from the Pages panel. In Chapter 32 I talk about using the Crop tool 
from the Print Production toolbar. In this chapter I’ll stick to using the Crop tool in the Advanced 
Editing toolbar.
Using the Crop tool
You can select the Crop tool and draw a marquee in the document window to define the crop 
region, double-click on the Crop tool in the Advanced Editing toolbar, or select the Crop Pages 
command from a context menu or panel menu in the Pages panel. Regardless of which manner 
you select to crop pages, the Crop Pages dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 16.18.

When you use the Crop tool from the Advanced Editing toolbar, the Crop Pages dialog box opens 
with a crop zone specified. You can edit the margins numerically where a keyline border displays 
the crop area dynamically as you change the margins. When you use the Crop tool, open a rectan-
gle marquee and move the mouse cursor inside the rectangle. The cursor changes to a selection 
arrow, indicating that you can double-click the mouse button to open the Crop Pages dialog box.

 CropBox. This is the default selection. It is shown with a black keyline for the 
cropped page when displayed or printed.
 ArtBox. The Art box is shown with a red rectangle. The Art box size includes the 
entire bounding box for the page size.

 TrimBox. The Trim box is shown with a green rectangle. Trim areas are usually 
determined by the printer’s marks indicating the finished paper size. The paper trim 
is made inside the bleed box.
 BleedBox. When you select the Bleed option, the keyline showing the crop area is 
blue. Bleeds allow colors to extend off the finished page size to account for paper 
trimming sizes.
 Show All Boxes. Displays the Crop, Trim, Bleed, and Art boxes.
 Units. From the pull-down menu select a unit of measure. The options include Points, 
Picas, Millimeters, Centimeters, and Inches.
 Margin Controls. Choices for margins are available for each side of the page. In the field 
boxes for each side, you can use the up or down arrows and watch a preview in the 
thumbnail at the top of the dialog box. As you press the up or down arrow, the margin 
line is displayed in the thumbnail. If you want to supply numeric values, enter them in 
the field boxes.
 Constrain Proportions. Check the box to keep proportions constrained. As you edit one 
text box in the Margin Controls, Acrobat supplies the same value in the remaining text 
boxes. For example, if you add one inch in the Top text box, Acrobat adds 1 inch to the 
Bottom, Left, and Right text boxes.
TIP
TIP
To quickly adjust margins you can click in any field box and press the up and down 
arrow keys on your keyboard. The margins jump in increments according to the 
units selected from the Units pull-down menu. Press the Shift key and arrow keys and the mar-
gins jump to the next whole unit. For example, when inches are used for the units of measure, 
pressing Shift plus an arrow changes the amount in whole inches.
 Remove White Margins. Acrobat makes an effort to eliminate white space on the page 
outside any visible data. Acrobat’s interpretation is confined to true white space. If a 
slight bit of gray appears as a border, it is not cropped.
 Set to Zero. This choice resets the crop margins to zero. If you change the dimensions 
with either of the preceding settings and want to regain the original dimensions of the 
crop boundary, click the Set to Zero button. From here you can redefine the margins. 
This button behaves much like a Reset button in other image editing programs.
 Revert To Selection. If you open a crop range and open the dialog box, and then change 
the margins or click the Set to Zero button, the crop rectangle is restored to the size it 
was when the dialog box was opened. That is, it’s restored to the original crop area. The 
view displays the crop area within the current page. In other words, the thumbnail pre-
view displays the entire page with the crop area indicated by a red rectangle.
 Change Page Size. You can change page sizes to standard fixed sizes by selecting options 
from the Page Sizes pull-down menu. You can also click the Custom radio button and the 
field boxes for Height and Width become active. Change values in the field boxes to create 
custom page sizes. When you add printer’s marks to a page or document, you can crop 
the page(s) larger than the page size to accommodate adding printer’s marks.

The Crop tool in the Advanced Editing toolbar and the Crop Pages tool in the Print 
Production toolbar offer you different options. The Crop Pages tool doesn’t permit 
you to crop a page down in size. For more information on adding printer’s marks and cropping 
pages, see Chapters 8 and 32.
TIP
TIP
If you want to see a larger view of what’s happening on your PDF document while 
making adjustments in the Crop Pages dialog box such as changing the page sizes, 
move the dialog box aside, and the background display in the Document pane dynamically 
updates to reflect many changes made in the Crop Pages dialog box.
 Page Range. Pages identified for cropping can be handled in the Page Range options. 
If All is selected, all pages in the PDF file are cropped according to the sizes you specify 
in the dialog box. You can target specific pages for cropping by entering values in the 
From and To field boxes. You select choices for Even and Odd Pages, Even Pages Only, 
and Odd Pages Only from the Apply to pull-down menu. The Selected option is available 
when you select page thumbnails in the Pages palette. If you select pages in the Pages pal-
ette, use the Document ➪ Crop Pages menu command. Using the Crop tool can deselect 
page thumbnails, and the Selected option appears grayed out when the Crop Pages dialog 
box opens.
TIP
TIP
When creating PDFs for slide presentations or screen views, you may occasionally 
have an unwanted white border around the pages. This appearance may result from 
creating pages in layout or illustration programs when the image data doesn’t precisely match 
the page size. To polish up the pages and eliminate any white lines, double-click the Crop tool 
or select the tool and double-click on the page. In the Crop Pages dialog box, select Remove 
White Margins and then select All for the page range. When the pages are cropped, the excess 
white lines are removed.
Cropping pages via context menu commands
Another choice you have for cropping pages is through the use of a context menu.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
A new feature in Acrobat 9 provides you several choices from a context menu 
opened when using the Crop tool. Drag open a rectangle with the Crop tool 
from the Advanced Editing toolbar and right click (Windows or with a two button mouse on the 
Macintosh) or Control + click on the Macintosh to open a context menu as shown in Figure 16.19.
Notice in Figure 16.19 you have choices to set the ArtBox, TrimBox, BleedBox, and CropBox. The 
choices are the same as those explained in the last section.
If you open a PDF document and you don’t see some or all the choices available in the context 
menu, it’s because the PDF file already has the margins embedded in the file. If you export to PDF 
from a program like Adobe InDesign and the file contains a bleed you won’t see all the menu com-
mands appear in the context menu.

Eliminating cropped data
When you save a file after setting the crop margins, the data still remains in the PDF document. You 
can open a file that was cropped using the Crop tool or a menu command and open the Crop Pages 
dialog box. When you set the margins back to zero, the cropped region appears in the Document 
pane. In essence, you don’t reduce a file size when using the Crop tool, because no data are elimi-
nated from the file.
In previous versions of Acrobat you had to crop a page and save the file in an image format such as 
TIF to eliminate the data outside the crop margins. Doing so eliminated the data and produced a 
smaller file size. If you opened the file in Acrobat and used the Crop tool, you couldn’t regain the 
cropped data.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
In Acrobat 9 you can now crop a page and eliminate the area outside the crop 
region without having to export the PDF file to an image format. To eliminate data 
outside the crop margins, you need to use the Crop tool and the Preflight dialog box.

Rotating Pages
PDF documents can contain many pages with different page sizes. You can have a business card, 
a letter-sized page, a tabloid page, and a huge poster all contained in the same file. Depending on 
the authoring program of an original document and the way a PDF is created, you may experience 
problems with pages appearing rotated or inverted. Acrobat offers you tools to rotate pages for 
viewing and printing solutions to correct such appearance problems.
You rotate pages with the Document ➪ Rotate Pages menu command or in the Pages panel via 
context or Options menus. When you select Rotate Pages through any of these methods, the Rotate 
Pages dialog box opens. You choose the direction of rotation from a pull-down menu that enables 
you to rotate the page three different ways, as shown in Figure 16.27. Options in the Rotate Pages 
dialog box include the following:
 Direction. Three choices appear from the Direction pull-down menu. Select from rotat-
ing pages clockwise 90 degrees, counterclockwise 90 degrees, or 180 degrees. Selecting 
clockwise or counterclockwise repeatedly rotates the page in 90-degree rotations.
 Page Range. Select All to rotate all pages in the PDF document.
 Selection. If you select page thumbnails in the Pages tab and select Rotate Pages from 
a context menu or by selecting Document ➪ Rotate Pages, the Rotate Pages dialog box 
offers you an option for rotating selected pages.

547
Editing Pages
16
 Pages. Enter the page range you want to rotate in the From and To field boxes.
 Rotate. The pull-down menu for Rotate offers selections for Even and Odd Pages, Even 
Pages Only, or Odd Pages Only. The last pull-down menu offers choices for Portrait 
Pages, Landscape Pages, or Pages of Any Orientation.
NOTE
NOTE
Rotate Pages is a menu command found in the menus discussed previously. When 
you rotate pages with a menu command, the pages are rotated and you can save the 
PDF with the new rotated appearances. You also have tools in the Page Display toolbar used for 
rotating views. When you use these tools to rotate a view, the page rotation is a temporary view 
and cannot be saved.
 FIGURE 16.27
The Rotate Pages dialog box offers options for rotating pages in a range or by selecting even or odd pages. 
The Even/Odd choices can be helpful when printing to devices requiring page rotations for duplexing.
Rotating PDF elements
When you rotate a page, all page content is rotated. If you have any layers, visible or hidden, they 
are rotated. Acrobat provides no means for rotating individual layers.
If you create comments on a page and later rotate the page, the comment notes rotate at the point 
of origin, but the note displays are not rotated. For example, if you create a comment note in the 
top-left corner of a page and rotate the page 90 degrees counterclockwise, the note icon on the page 
is rotated, eventually ending up in the lower left corner of the page. However, the open note is 
viewed at the default view with the note text in its original orientation.
Form fields behave differently than notes. If you create a form field containing text, the field and 
contents are rotated with the page.

Editing PDFs
Part III
Minimizing rotation problems
Among the major problems with PDF page rotation involves creating PDFs from layout programs. 
Layout programs such as Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress enable you to transverse pages in the 
Print dialog box. This control is implemented for digital prepress and printing to high-end printing 
devices. In addition, many PostScript Printer Description files (PPDs) used with high-end devices 
include transverse page options for page size selections.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on commercial printing and PPDs, see Chapter 32.
As an example, a portrait page that prints transversed is rotated 90 degrees to conserve media on 
roll-fed devices. If you print files to disk as PostScript and distill the files in Acrobat Distiller, don’t 
transverse the pages. When transversed pages are opened in Acrobat, even though the auto rotate 
feature is enabled during distillation, Acrobat interprets the page coordinates with a 90-degree 
rotation. The end result is a zero point (0,0) located in the lower-right corner of the page. This 
interpretation can lead to problems when you’re trying to define x,y coordinates for JavaScripts, 
replacing pages, and copying and pasting data between documents.
If you set up a landscape page in a layout program, print the file as a portrait page with the hori-
zontal width described in field boxes for custom page sizes. Print the file to disk and distill in 
Acrobat Distiller. The end product is a PDF that winds up with the proper page orientation and 
is interpreted by Acrobat with the zero point (0,0) located in the default lower left corner.
PREPRESS
PREPRESS
Design and print professionals who seek to print files from PDFs can create the PDFs 
without transversing pages. When printing the PDFs for prepress, use the Acrobat 
Print dialog box to control printing, and select device PPDs from within Acrobat. If you need to 
repurpose documents for Web or screen presentations, you can use the same file created for 
prepress without having to reprint and redistill the authoring document.

Creating Headers and Footers
Headers and Footers can be used for adding page numbers, dates, and any custom data you want 
to add to a header and footer appearing on all or a range of pages.
When you select Document ➪ Header & Footer ➪ Add, the Add Header and Footer dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 16.28. You’ll notice the Add Header and Footer dialog box is the same 
dialog box you use when adding Bates numbers (see “Using Bates numbering” later in this chapter).
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
The Add Header and Footer dialog box in Acrobat 9 offers you the option for batch 
processing files. Click the Apply to Multiple button in the Add Header and Footer 
dialog box and you can load files in a wizard to apply settings to multiple files.

549
Editing Pages
16
 FIGURE 16.28
Select Document ➪ Add Header & Footer to open the Add Header and Footer dialog box.
You create page headers and footers in this dialog box. Options exist for adding a date stamp, a 
page number, and a custom text description. In Figure 16.28, I added a page number as a header 
and a Web address as a footer to apply to all pages in my open document. Both headers and foot-
ers can be added in the same dialog box. Among your choices in the Add Headers and Footers 
dialog box are the following:
 Saved Settings. You can select options from the pull-down menu. By default no settings 
are listed in the menu. Make your settings adjustments in the dialog box and click Save 
Settings. Name your settings and they are added to the Saved Settings menu. If you want 
to delete a saved setting, select the setting and click the Delete button.
 Font (Name). All the system fonts available to you from your operating system are dis-
played in a pull-down menu. Click the down-pointing arrow and make your font choice. 
You can assign a different font to each line of text in the listed items in the six boxes 
below the menu.
 Font (Size). Font sizes can be assigned individually to each line of text. If you want cus-
tom text to appear larger than a date or page number, select the item after clicking an Insert 
button and choose a font size from the pull-down menu. You select a font from preset 
point sizes. You cannot edit the field box to add a point size other than the preset sizes.

 Margins. The four Margins field boxes are editable. You can physically position a header 
or footer at any location on a page. If you add a header, the options relate to the top, left, 
and right field boxes. Footers relate to all but the top field box. Entering values in the 
lower field box has no effect on the position where the text is added when adding head-
ers. If you use top = 5 inches, left = 3 inches, and select the left alignment radio button, 
the text is added 5 inches from the top and 3 inches from the left side.
 
Although a header or footer extending beyond the space shown in the Preview area 
(denoted by dashed lines) disappears from the preview, you can move data outside the 
guidelines by adding values in the Margins text box and clicking OK. When you view the 
PDF file, the data appear at the coordinates you described in the Margins text boxes.
 Appearance Options. Six boxes are shown for adding data. The top row of three boxes is 
used for adding headers. The second row of three boxes across is used for adding footers. 
You can type custom text in any one of the six boxes.
 Insert Page Number. Click the box in the Appearance Options where you want a date 
to appear and type the code used for a date format. The same five date formats you have 
available with page numbering are also available in the Add Headers and Footers dialog 
box. To select a date format, you can click the Page Number and Date Format link to the 
right of the Insert Date button (see Page Number and Date Format).
 Insert Date. Follow the same steps as when adding a page number. First click in the box 
where you want the data to appear, then choose a date format and insert it.
 Page Number and Date Format. The blue text is like a button. Clicking the text opens 
the Page Number and Date Format dialog box, as shown in Figure 16.29. From pull-
down menus you select formats for Date, Page number, and a page to start adding the 
header and/or footer.
 FIGURE 16.29
Click Page Number and Date format to open the Page Number and Date Format 
dialog box.
 Page Range Options. By default, all pages are used when you add a page header and/or 
footer. You can control page ranges by clicking the Page Range Options blue text. Clicking 
the text opens the Page Range Options dialog box shown in Figure 16.30. Select Pages 
from and type values in the text boxes. From the subset pull-down menu, you have All 
Pages, Even Pages Only, or Odd Pages Only.

 Preview. The Preview Page text box and up/down arrows permit you to scroll through 
the document. Below this item are the preview boxes for headers and footers. You cannot 
type in either of the boxes. They are used only for previewing data added in the top six 
boxes.
Click OK after adding data to a header and/or footer and the data are applied to your selected 
page range.
TIP
TIP
If the layout of your design elements on each page make it difficult to find a space 
to add a header or footer, you can use the Crop tool to add a little more space to 
the top, bottom, or both top and bottom of the pages. In the Crop Pages dialog box, uncheck 
Center and set the YOffset to add space to the top or bottom of the pages. A 0.5 YOffset adds 
one-half inch to the bottom of the page, and a –0.5 adds one-half inch to the top of the page. 
After cropping the pages, use the Document ➪ Header and Footer ➪ Add command to add a 
header or footer to the new space added to your pages.
Updating headers and footers
If you add or delete pages, the headers and footers are not dynamic and do not change when add-
ing or deleting pages. You need to reedit the headers and footers to renumber pages deleted from 
a document or add header/footer data to pages inserted in your document. From the Document ➪ 
Header & Footer menu, select Update. The Update Header and Footer dialog box opens. Options 
in this dialog box are identical to the Add Header and Footer dialog box.
The Update Header and Footer dialog box displays the exact same settings you used when you first 
added a header and/or footer. Just click OK if you want the update to be exactly the same as your 
original assignment of headers and footers, and the file is updated.
Removing headers and footers
In earlier versions of Acrobat prior to version 8, the only way you could remove a background was 
to open the Add Header and Footer dialog box and return all settings to defaults, and then click 
OK. Acrobat essentially replaced your headers and footers with nothing. In Acrobat 8 and 9 you 

552
Editing PDFs

have a menu command specifically used for removing headers and footers. Select Document ➪ 
Header & Footer ➪ Remove. A dialog box opens prompting you to confirm the action. Click OK 
and your headers and footers are removed.
Numbering Pages
In Acrobat, page numbers appear in the Page Navigation toolbar at the top of the Acrobat window 
and in the Pages panel. When you open the Go To Page dialog box (View ➪ Go To ➪ Page or Ctrl/
Ô+Alt/Option+N) and enter a value in the status bar and press Enter/Return, you may find that the 
destination page does not correspond with the page number you supplied in the dialog box. This 
is because certain documents may be numbered in sections where front matter, such as a table of 
contents, foreword, preface, and other such items precede the page numbering in a document. 
This is particularly true of books, pamphlets, essays, journals, and similar documents using num-
bering schemes other than integers for the front matter.
Numbering individual PDF documents
Pages in a PDF file can be renumbered using the Page Numbering dialog box that you access with 
a simple menu command. Open the Pages panel and open a context menu on a page thumbnail. 
From the menu options, select Number Pages. The Page Numbering dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 16.31.
 FIGURE 16.31
The Page Numbering dialog box offers options for numbering pages.

553
Editing Pages
16
The Page Numbering dialog box offers options for selecting a range of pages and renumbering 
them in sections or throughout the entire document. The choices available to you include:
 Pages. This area of the dialog box asks you to specify the page range. If you want to 
renumber all pages with the same numbering scheme, select the All radio button. You 
might use this option when numbering pages with integers.
 
If you enable the radio button for Selected, only the pages selected in the Pages panel are 
affected. By default the Selected radio button is enabled if you click on a page or a page’s 
thumbnail in the Pages panel and open the dialog box. If no page thumbnail is selected, 
the default radio button selection is From.
 
Enable the From radio button and supply a page range in the field boxes to select a page 
range numerically according to page position in the document. That is to say, pages 1 to 
10 are interpreted as the first ten pages in the file regardless of the page numbering scheme 
used before you open the dialog box. Perhaps you want to create a separate scheme for a 
document’s front matter. Specifying the scheme in the Numbering section of the dialog 
box renumbers the selection. Click OK to accept the changes. If you want to renumber 
another section, return to the dialog box and select a new section and new scheme. 
Repeat the process for all changes in page numbering according to different sections.
 Numbering. This portion of the dialog box offers you options for determining the page-
numbering scheme you want to use. From the Style pull-down menu select a number 
style (refer to Figure 16.24 for your choices).
 Style. If None is selected, no page number is assigned to the page. The readout in the 
status bar would appear similar to this: (10 of 100). The numbers within the paren-
theses represent the original page number order preceded by a blank space where no 
number (None) is specified. If you want to add a prefix, you could add alphanumeric 
data to the Prefix field box and supply a prefix with no number. Using the same exam-
ple, the readout would appear something like this: A000 (10 of 100), where A000 is 
the prefix and no number follows.
 
The remaining options in the Style pull-down menu are specific choices for styles of 
page numbers. If you have front matter where you want to use Roman numerals, you 
can choose between the two styles shown in Figure 16.32. Alpha characters offer 
you options for uppercase or lowercase letters, and integers are also available. You can 
combine these options with special characters by typing data in the Prefix field box.
 FIGURE 16.32
Select number styles from the Style pull-down menu.

554
Editing PDFs
Part III
 Prefix. Type any character, number, or combination of numbers and characters in 
the field box for a prefix value. The prefix precedes the numbering scheme defined 
in the Style pull-down menu.
 Start. The Start item is used to indicate the number a new section starts with. Typically 
you use 1 to start a new section, but you can begin sections with any number you 
want to type in the field box. Upon occasion you may have a document where page 
insertions might be added later. You can number pages in a section leaving room for 
new additions to be made later in another editing session.
 Extend numbering used in preceding section to selected pages. For this option 
you need to select a range of page thumbnails in the Pages panel, and then open the 
Page Numbering dialog box. Selecting the radio button and clicking OK removes the cur-
rently assigned numbers and extends the previous section. For example, you may have 
Appendix A numbered A-1 through A-10. You later decide to combine Appendix B with 
Appendix A. Appendix B might be numbered B-1 through B-10. To extend the previous 
B numbered pages, you select the page thumbnails in the Pages panel, open the dialog 
box, and select this radio button. When you click OK, pages formerly numbered B-1 
through B-10 are changed to A-11 through A-20.
TIP
TIP
If you have multiple files you want to renumber, use a batch sequence to renumber 
a folder of PDF files. For more information on batch sequences, see Chapter 18. 
Note that using a batch sequence for renumbering pages is limited to renumbering each docu-
ment individually. You cannot consecutively number multiple files using a batch sequence for 
page numbering.
Using Bates numbering
Bates numbering is a method to keep multiple documents in a recognizable order. The legal industry 
uses Bates numbering when identifying legal documents in court cases. During the discovery phase 
of a case in litigation, there might be an enormous number of documents submitted as evidence. A 
Bates numbering system is used to provide an arbitrary unique identifier for each document. The 
numbers are typically numeric, but they can also be alphanumeric. There is no standardized algo-
rithm used for a Bates numbering schema in a court case for assigning numbers to documents; 
however, the numbers are generally eight or more characters in length. An example of a schema 
that might be used to disclose documents in the legal environment is shown in Figure 16.33.
Rather than open a PDF document in Acrobat and number each file individually, the Bates num-
bering feature lets you batch process multiple files and add unique numbers in a numeric order to 
multiple files without opening them.

3. Order the documents. Click a document and click the Up or Down buttons to organize 
the files in the order you want them to appear. Because the Bates numbering system uses 
no standardized algorithm and the numbers are arbitrary, you don’t need to worry about 
organizing files according to dates, topics, and so on. Simply make some order arrange-

4. Click OK.
 
5. Add the number schema for the select documents. When you click OK, a lightly mod-
ified version of the Add Header and Footer dialog box opens as shown in Figure 16.35. 
You can align the numbers left, center, or right by clicking in the Left, Center, or Right 
Header or Footer text box and then click the Insert Bates Number button.
 
 When you click Insert Bates Number, the Bates Numbering System dialog box opens. Add 
the total digits (including alpha characters if you use alpha characters for a number schema) 
in the Number of Digits text box. You have an option to type the start number, a prefix, 
and a suffix. Click OK and the Bates number is shown in the field box respective to your 
selection. In Figure 16.35, I added a three-character prefix and six numbers for my num-
bering schema.

Removing Bates numbers
Removing Bates numbers is handled differently depending on whether a document is open in the 
Document pane and whether Bates numbers are actually included in the files where you want to 
eliminate the numbers. The various behaviors include the following:
 No documents open in Document pane. Choosing Document ➪ Header & Footer ➪ 
Remove opens the Header & Footer dialog box shown in Figure 16.37. You can remove 
Bates numbers using this dialog box.
 Document open with no Bates number. If you have a document open but the docu-
ment contains no Bates number an alert dialog box opens informing you that no Bates 
numbers are detected.
 Document open with Bates number. If you open a document that does contain Bates 
numbers, no dialog box opens. The numbers are removed by Acrobat.
PDF Portfolios with Bates numbers
If you want to group documents according to a certain Bates numbering schema, first use the Bates 
Numbering dialog box and add Bates numbers to all your PDF documents. Next, use the Assemble 
Files into a Portfolio option in the Combine Files task button menu. Create a PDF Portfolio and all 
your files are assembled in one PDF collection with Bates numbers. In Figure 16.38, you can see 
an example of a PDF Portfolio with Bates numbers.

Adding Watermarks and Backgrounds
You add watermarks and backgrounds in different dialog boxes, but the attributes for both items 
are almost identical. A few options are different in the Add Watermark dialog box where you can 
add custom data in addition to importing files. You can also add a watermark in front of or behind 
page data. Backgrounds are only added behind page data.
Adding backgrounds
To add a background to a PDF document, choose Document ➪ Background ➪ Add/Replace. The 
Add Background dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 16.39.
 FIGURE 16.39
Choose Document ➪ Background ➪ Add/Replace to open the Add Background dialog box.
Choices you have for adding backgrounds include the following:
 Saved Settings. The options here are the same as when adding headers and footers. See 
the section “Creating headers and footers” earlier in this chapter.
 Page Range Options. Click the text and the Page Range Options dialog box opens. The 
same dialog box with the same options is opened as when adding headers and footers. 
See the section “Creating headers and footers” earlier in this chapter.
 Source. Choose From color or File to add a background color or import a file. To change 
the background color, click the From color radio button and a color palette opens where 
you make a color choice to apply as a background color.

To add a file for a background, click File and click the Browse button. The Browse dialog 
box opens where you select a file to import. File types supported include PDF documents, 
BMP, and JPEG. Note that choices for adding text along with a background are not avail-
able. Because the Add Watermark feature appears in a different dialog box, all text options 
are available only in the Add Watermark dialog box.
 Appearance. Several different options are listed in the Appearance settings. These include:
 Rotation. You can rotate backgrounds in 1-degree increments by typing values in the 
Rotation text box or clicking the up and down arrows.
 Opacity. Opacity adjustments are made by moving the slider, typing values in the text 
box, or clicking the up and down arrows. In Figure 16.40, objects were rotated in two 
separate documents. The object on the left was rotated +45 degrees. The object on the 
right was rotated +135 degrees with an opacity of 20%.
 Scale relative to target page. By default, the scaling is set to 100%. Type a value in 
the text box for scaling up or down to the desired value.
 Appearance Options. Click the Appearance Options blue text and the Appearance 
Options dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 16.41. In the dialog box you can toggle 
on and off showing backgrounds when printing and when displayed on your monitor.

 Position. Set options for the position of the background by typing values in the text boxes for 
Vertical Distance and Horizontal Distance. From the first set of pull-down menus, select a unit 
of measure. The second set of pull-down menus lets you position the vertical and horizontal 
placement from Top, Center, and Bottom. In Figure 16.42, the position of an object with the 
Vertical Distance menu options is shown first and the Horizontal Distance menu options is 
shown second. It also shows how the objects fall on a page when making the menu choices.

 Preview Page. In the preview area, you see a page preview of an imported background 
(or background color if you click the From color radio button). The Preview Page text 
box is used to type a page number, and the respective page appears in the Preview win-
dow. You can toggle through all pages and view the page previews before applying a 
background. Click OK in the Add Background dialog box and the background is added 
to pages in the selected page range.
Replacing backgrounds
From the Document ➪ Background menu, the item for adding backgrounds and replacing back-
grounds opens the same dialog box. Select Document ➪ Background ➪ Add/Replace and follow the 
same steps used for adding a background. If a file contains a background, the new background you 
select from either a color or a file replaces the old background.
Updating backgrounds
If you add a background to a PDF file from an image file, and then edit the image file and select 
Document ➪ Background ➪ Update, Acrobat won’t update the edited background. A dynamic link 
is not made from Acrobat to the image file. If you want to update a background imported from an 
image file, you need to click again on the Browse button and identify your edited image file. Add it 
as you add a new background and the PDF background is updated.
Removing backgrounds
As with the menu command for removing headers and footers, you also have a new command in 
Acrobat 8 for removing backgrounds. To remove the current background, select Document ➪ 
Background ➪ Remove and a dialog box opens. Click OK and the background is removed.
Adding watermarks
Select Document ➪ Watermark ➪ Add to add a watermark to a PDF. Watermarks generally appear 
on top of page data, but in Acrobat 8 and 9 you can chose to have a watermark appear on top of or 
behind the page data. The Add Watermark dialog box that opens, as shown in Figure 16.43, is 
similar to the Add Background dialog box.
The Add Watermark dialog box contains a few different options than the Add Background dialog 
box. The first noticeable difference is the Source area in the Add Watermark dialog box. The first 
item and the default selection is Text. You have a text box where text is typed in the Add Watermark 
dialog box. Below the text box are some options for changing text attributes.
As yet, however, you don’t have an option for creating outline text that would be helpful when cre-
ating watermarks. The only way to create outline text is to first create it in an illustration program 
such as Adobe Illustrator and import the text as a graphic in the Add Watermark dialog box.
In the appearance area of the Add Watermark dialog box, you find options for fixed rotations as 
well as arbitrary rotations. The Location options enable you to place your watermark behind or in 
front of the page data. The remaining choices are the same as those found in the Add Background 
dialog box.

Graphics placed behind page data only appear in transparent areas on the page. 
To quickly check what areas are transparent (as opposed to opaque), open the 
Preferences dialog box (Ctrl/Ô+K) and click Page Display in the left pane. Click the Show trans-
parency grid check box in the right pane and click OK. All the areas appearing with transparency 
are shown in the Document pane.
To create a watermark on a PDF document, follow these steps.
STEPS: Adding a watermark to a PDF document
 
1. Open a file in Acrobat. Use any PDF document that you want to appear with a watermark.
 
2. Open the Add Watermark dialog box. Choose Document ➪ Watermark ➪ Add. The 
Add Watermark dialog box opens.
 
3. Type text in the Text box. In my example, I typed Draft in the text box I’ll use for 
watermarking draft documents.
 
4. Set Font attributes. Select a font from the Font pull-down menu, select a font size, and 
click the color swatch and choose a color. Note that if you select a particular hue in the 
color palette and you want that hue to appear lighter, you can reduce opacity with the 
Opacity slider. For example, to make a light gray, select the default black color and set 
the opacity to 20 to 30 percent.

564

5. Edit appearance settings. In my example, I wanted the text rotated, so I clicked the 45° 
radio button. I reduced the opacity of my black color selection to 30% and then I clicked 
the Scale relative to target page check box. This action scaled my text to fit the page size. 
Note that if you scale text to fit a page, any font size you select in the Source area of the 
dialog box works.
 
6. Edit the location. Determine whether you want your watermark on top of the page con-
tent or behind it. In my example, I wanted the watermark to appear behind my page data 
so I clicked the Appear behind page radio button.
 
7. Preview pages. Click the Preview Page arrows or type values in the text box to scroll 
through the pages to which you want to apply your watermark.
 
8. Set Appearance Options. Click the Appearance Options blue text to open the Appearance 
Options dialog box. Check the boxes to either show or not show the watermark when 
printing and screen viewing. Another check box is available to keep the watermark posi-
tion and size constant on different page sizes. Check this box if you’re working with files 
that have different page sizes and click OK.
 Set the Page Range. Click the Page Range Options blue text in the top right corner of 
the dialog box to open the Page Range Options dialog box. If you want all pages to appear 
with a watermark, you don’t need to open this dialog box. If you want a page range 
less than all pages, type the page numbers in the from and to text boxes and click OK.
 Save the settings. If this is a watermark you intend to reuse with other documents, 
you can save the settings and use them whenever you want to apply the same water-
mark. Click the Save Settings button at the top of the dialog box and the Save Settings 
dialog box opens. Type a name for your new setting and click OK. The new setting 
now appears under the Saved Settings pull-down. In Figure 16.44, I added my new 
Draft settings to the menu.

If you don’t want anyone to tamper with watermarks added to your PDF files such 
as changing or deleting them, you can secure your file against editing pages using 
Acrobat Security. For more information on how to secure PDFs, see Chapter 26.

Removing and updating watermarks
The options for removing and updating watermarks are the same as removing and updating back-
grounds. Select Document ➪ Watermarks and the submenu commands appear for Add, Update, 
and Remove. If you want to modify a saved setting, choose Document ➪ Watermark ➪ Update. Edit 
your settings and click OK. Acrobat updates all pages containing watermarks. Clicking Remove in 
the Watermark submenu opens the same dialog box as when removing backgrounds. Click OK 
and all watermarks are removed.
Note that if you want to remove backgrounds or watermarks from selected pages in a file while 
keeping backgrounds/watermarks on some pages, clicking the Remove menu item removes all 
watermarks/backgrounds from your document. You then need to add the watermarks/backgrounds 
to pages where you want them to appear.
When adding watermarks and backgrounds, you can’t select pages in the Pages panel and apply 
watermarks/backgrounds to selected pages in the panel. You must use the Page Range dialog box 
to apply watermarks/backgrounds to a page range. Acrobat makes no provision for adding these 
items to noncontiguous pages. You have to individually apply watermarks/backgrounds to pages 
in a noncontiguous order.
TIP
TIP
If you want to add a watermark or background on a form enabled with Adobe Reader 
usage rights, first apply the watermark or background to a PDF, and then enable the 
file with usage rights. If you attempt to add a watermark or background to an enabled file, you 
need to save a copy of the file, add the watermark or background, and then re-enable the file. 
(For more information on enabling files with Adobe Reader extensions, see Chapter 19.)
Summary
 You can enlarge or reduce page thumbnails through successive menu commands in the

 You can open the Pages panel to full-screen size where you can sort and reorder pages.
 Page thumbnails can be used to navigate pages and zoom in on pages.
 To copy pages in a PDF document and between PDF documents, you can use page 
thumbnails.
 Page thumbnails are created on-the-fly when you open the Pages panel. If you want to 
speed up the screen refreshes when opening the Pages panel, you can embed thumbnails 
from a menu option in the Pages panel and delete them after your editing sessions.
 Pages are inserted, deleted, extracted, and replaced through menu commands from the 
Pages panel context menu or the pane pull-down menu.
 New in Acrobat 9 is the Split Document command, enabling you to split files according 
to page count, file size, and top-level bookmarks.

 You crop PDF pages with the Crop tool. When you crop a page, the page view is reduced 
to the crop region, but all the original data in terms of page size is still contained in the 
file. You can return to the Crop Page dialog box and undo crops even after a file has been 
saved.
 You can eliminate data outside a crop box permanently using the Preflight tool.
 You can rotate PDF pages in 90- and 180-degree rotations via menu commands in the 
Rotate Pages dialog box.
 Enabling a preference setting for viewing logical pages helps you navigate to pages num-
bered with integers.
 Opening the Page Numbering dialog box from a context menu in the Pages panel enables 
you to renumber pages in a PDF file.
 To number multiple PDF documents with consecutive numbering, use the Bates 
Numbering dialog box. To add page numbers to a collection of PDFs without consecutive 
numbers, use the Batch Processing command.
 To add page numbers to a PDF document, use the Add Header and Footer dialog box.
 You can add different headers and footers to different pages in a PDF document. Each 
time the content for headers and footers changes, you open the Add Header and Footer 
dialog box, add the content, and specify the page range.
 To add a background to a document, use the Add Background dialog box. To add a 
watermark to a file, use the Add Watermark dialog box.
 Backgrounds and watermarks can be updated and removed
 After you save a PDF with a watermark and/or background, the data are embedded in the 
PDF document. In Acrobat 8 or 9, you can always return to a document and remove 
backgrounds and watermarks.

elcome to the world of one-stop scanning and text recognition. 
Anyone who scanned documents in earlier versions of Acrobat 
will appreciate the one-step operation for scanning a text docu-
ment and performing text recognition via Acrobat’s Optical Character 
Recognition (OCR) engine and many new enhancements to Acrobat Scan. The 
one-stop scanning introduced in Acrobat 8 has been improved in Acrobat 9 
through the implementation of a new scanning technology called ClearScan, 
the addition of presets that support custom settings you can configure for 
various source materials, creating multiple files from scanned documents, 
adding multiple scanned documents to a PDF Portfolio, and much more 
with the new Acrobat Scan features in Acrobat 9.
When performing a scan in Acrobat, you are not limited to scanning docu-
ments for text conversions. Acrobat enables you to scan photos and images 
that might have some other uses. Therefore, this chapter covers all the 
aspects of scanning from within Acrobat using the Scan to PDF command 
and the Text Recognition commands.
Setting Up the Scanning Work 
Environment
For scanning and text recognition tasks, you need access to the TouchUp 
Text tool. First, reset the tools from a context menu opened from the Toolbar 
Well and choose Tools ➪ Advanced Editing ➪ Show Advanced Editing 
Toolbar. When the toolbar opens, dock it in the Toolbar Well. Note that if 
you want to eliminate some tools from the Advanced Editing toolbar such as

the Article tool and the Link tool, and other tools not likely to be used when scanning documents, 
you can open the More Tools window and choose the toolset you want in the Advanced Editing 
toolbar.
During text recognition, you may want to create several views that enable you to zoom in to see 
words requiring edits. Tools handy for displaying different views are found in the Page Display 
toolbar. Open the More Tools window and check the boxes for Single page continuous and One 
Full Page as well as the Page Display Toolbar check box and click OK. Dock the toolbars in the 
Toolbar Well by opening a context menu on the Toolbar Well and selecting Dock Toolbars.
Configuring Scanners
Before you can scan a page in Acrobat, you need to configure your scanner and be certain it func-
tions properly. After you complete your installation of Acrobat, it should recognize your scanner 
immediately. If all the scanner hardware is in place and operational and Acrobat still does not rec-
ognize your scanner, the next step is to be certain Acrobat recognizes the scanner’s software. If 
Acrobat doesn’t see your scanner, you may need to relocate software to another location on your 
hard drive or acquire a software update from your scanner manufacturer.
You get access to your scanner in Acrobat through one of three methods: TWAIN drivers, Acquire 
plug-ins, or WIA-compliant drivers.
TWAIN software
TWAIN (Technology With An Important Name) software is manufacturer-supplied and should be 
available on the CD-ROM you receive with your scanner. In Windows, the TWAIN files are stored 
in the \Windows\twain_32 folder. When you install scanner software, the TWAIN driver should 
find the proper folder through the installer routine. On the Macintosh you’ll find TWAIN resources 
in the System\Library\Image Capture\TWAIN Data Sources folder.
Many scanner manufacturers produce the equipment but use third-party developers to write the soft-
ware. Adobe has certainly not tested the Scan plug-in with all scanner manufacturers and all software 
developers, but many of the popular brands have been thoroughly tested to work seamlessly with 
Acrobat. Theoretically, the TWAIN software should work in most cases. If you have problems access-
ing your scanner from within Acrobat, but can perform scans in other applications, then you most 
likely have a problem with the TWAIN driver. If this is the case, contact your scanner manufacturer 
and see whether it has an upgrade or whether you can get some technical support. In many cases, 
you can download upgrades for registered software on the Internet.
Adobe Photoshop plug-in software
Acrobat 9.0 supports Acquire plug-ins to use with Adobe Photoshop. More prevalent than TWAIN 
drivers, Photoshop plug-ins are available from just about every scanner manufacturer. If you use 
Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Photoshop Elements, you may need to copy your Photoshop Acquire 

569
Scanning and OCR Conversion
17
plug-in to your Acrobat plug-ins folder. On Windows, copy the Photoshop Acquire plug-in and 
open the Acrobat\plug_ins\PaperCapture folder and paste your Acquire plug-in.
Mac OS X requires you to expand the Acrobat 9.0 Pro package in order to paste your Photoshop 
Acquire plug-in. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Open your Applications/Adobe Acrobat 9.0 Pro folder and select (not double-click) 
Adobe Acrobat 9.0 Pro.
 
2. Ctrl+click to open a context menu, and select Show Package Contents. The Contents 
folder appears in the Adobe Acrobat 9.0 Pro folder.
 
3. Double-click the Contents folder and double-click the Plug-ins folder that comes 
into view.
 
4. Double-click the PaperCapture.acroplugin folder and drag your Photoshop Acquire 
plug-in into this folder. (Option+click+drag to copy the plug-in to the target folder.) 
When you close the folders, the package is restored.
Configuring Windows Imaging Architecture (WIA) 
scan drivers (Windows only)
TWAIN drivers have been around for a long time and many developers are still supporting TWAIN 
drivers, buy many newer scanners are now supporting a more recent driver technology called 
Windows Imaging Architecture (WIA). WIA is a Microsoft-developed technology that provides 
developers a relatively easy way to write support for scanners. Developers such as Acer, Compaq, 
Epson, Fujitsu, HP, Kodak, Microtek, Ricoh, and UMAX have all embraced WIA in many of their 
newer models.
The good news from Adobe is that if you have a WIA-supported scanner you can configure 
your scanner’s scan button with Acrobat. To do so, open the Start Menu and choose Control 
Panels/Scanners and cameras/<scanner name>. The Scanners and Cameras dialog box opens. 
Click your scanner name and click the Properties button to open the scanner properties.
Scanners and PDF
P
DF is so popular that just about every developer in one market or another is supporting the 
Portable Document Format. Today, you find the support for PDF broadening with scanner devel-
opers. Many new scanner models support hardware buttons on the scanners for scanning to a PDF 
file. Additionally, you can find scanner proprietary software supporting scanning to PDF.
In some cases you can find scanners that do marvelous jobs of scanning to PDF files, but they don’t 
support WIA architecture or TWAIN drivers — such is the case with the Fujitsu Scansnap 510 scan-
ner. In these cases, you can use the scanner’s button or the software to scan to PDF. Once the file is 
scanned to PDF it typically opens in Acrobat where you can recognize text and populate forms with 
form fields.

The WIA scanner properties dialog box opens as shown in Figure 17.1. Select your scanner’s Scan, 
Copy, Photo, or other button you want to activate. When using scanners with a button to initiate a 
scan, choose the Scan button. Click the Start the Program radio button and choose Adobe Acrobat 
from the options in the pull-down menu. Click OK; the next time you hit your Scan button on 
your scanner, the scan is opened in Adobe Acrobat.
 FIGURE 17.1

Understanding Scanning Essentials
At this point you should have your scanner and Acrobat configured properly. Before I begin discuss-
ing how to use your scanner with Acrobat, take a moment to understand some of the essential issues 
to deal with in performing clean, accurate scans. A few items need to be discussed: the hardware 
and hardware-related issues; the types of scans to be produced; and understanding your scanner 
capabilities. A few moments here saves you much time in producing the best scans you can expect 
from your equipment.
The hardware issue to consider is your scanner. The single most important issue with scanner hard-
ware is keeping the platen clean. If you have dust and dirt on the glass, these particles show up in 
your scans. Keep the platen clean, and use a lint-free cloth to clean the glass. If you use a solvent, 
always apply the solvent to the cloth and not the scanner glass.

571
Scanning and OCR Conversion
17
Preparing a document
Just as your scans can benefit from careful attention to your scanner, exercising a little care with 
the source material can help produce clean scans. Bits of dust, improperly aligned pages, poor con-
trast, and degraded originals affect your ability to create scans that the text recognition software 
can read without many errors. A little preparation before scanning saves you much time in trying 
to clean up poorly scanned images.
Photocopying originals
Sometimes you can improve image and text contrast by photocopying original documents. Try some 
experiments to test your results. Placing photocopies made from large, bulky material on the scanner 
bed ultimately results in better scans than when using the original material.
Ensuring straight alignment
If you have documents with frayed edges or pages torn from a magazine, trim the edges and make 
them parallel to the text on the page. Precise placement of pages on the scanner bed facilitates clean 
scans. Even though Acrobat has a recognition capability within a 14-degree rotation, the straighter 
the page, the better the results. Acrobat 8 and 9 can actually rotates a scan 90 degrees and 180 
degrees, and new text recognition improvements are spectacular with pages rotated 180 degrees. 
However, as a matter of practice, try to keep the source material rotated in the proper portrait view 
on the scanner platen.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Be certain to observe copyright laws when scanning published material. If you scan 
text from books and magazines, you need to obtain permission from the publisher 
before using the material.
Try to remember the axiom “garbage in, garbage out” when you approach any kind of scanning. The 
better the source material, the better your scanned results. Exercise a little care in the beginning, and 
your Acrobat scanning sessions move along much faster.
Using Scan to PDF
As I mentioned in the beginning of this chapter, Acrobat offers you one-step scanning and OCR 
conversion. Before getting into all the options in dialog boxes and what they mean, let’s look at 
scanning a document and recognizing text.
Scanning on Windows
Scanning on Windows and the Macintosh follows a similar path, but there are some differences in 
the options you have available on one platform versus the other. For Windows users, follow the 
steps below to scan a document and recognize the text.

Part III
STEPS: Scanning a text document (Windows)
 
1. Place a document on the scanner platen. Be certain your scanner is configured and 
operational.
 
2. Select Document ➪ Scan to PDF (or open the Create task button pull-down menu 
and select Create from Scanner) ➪ Custom Scan. The Custom Scan dialog box opens, 
as shown in Figure 17.2.
NEW FEATURE

Note that you have several submenu options on Windows to choose from for scan-
ning to a PDF. If you haven’t configured presets, try using the Custom Scan opera-
tion first. Later in this chapter in the section “Working with presets” you’ll learn how to configure 
the presets.
 
3. Select your scanner. The first task is to be certain your scanner appears listed on the 
Scanner pull-down menu in the Custom Scan dialog box. If you don’t see your scanner 
here, then you have a configuration problem. Assuming everything is working okay, 
select your scanner as shown in Figure 17.2.

4. Select the resolution. From the Resolution pull-down menu choose a resolution setting. 
Higher resolutions take longer but produce much better results. At a minimum you 
should use 300 dpi for the scan resolution.
 
5. Paper size. Choose a paper size for the artwork. If you use A4 paper, be sure to make the 
choice here for A4. Also, if using US Letter paper, make the choice accordingly.
 
6. Select the output. If you have a document open in the Document pane, you can append 
your document with the new scan. If you want to create a separate document, click New 
PDF Document in the Output section of the Custom Scan dialog box.
 
7. Set document quality. For a first-time effort, leave the slider at the default.
 
8. Make searchable. Check the box for Make Searchable (Run OCR). This check box informs 
Acrobat to use the OCR engine to convert the scanned image to recognizable text.
 
9. Click Scan. Leave the remaining items at the defaults and click the Scan button to com-
mence scanning. Note that the resolution settings, paper size, and clicking the Scan but-
ton apply to WIA-compliant scanners. If your scanner is not WIA compliant, you may 
need to use a TWAIN driver that automatically opens your scanner interface. In your 
scanner’s software, you need to make choices for the items you don’t have available in 
Acrobat and click the Scan button.
 
10. Check the document for recognizable text. Click the Select tool in the Editing toolbar 
and drag through the document. You should see the text selected as you drag, as shown 
in Figure 17.3.

Scanning on the Macintosh
Some of the new features related to setting up scanning presets are not available to Macintosh users. 
In addition, you don’t have WIA support on the Macintosh. All your scanning occurs using a 
TWAIN driver and making choices for scan attributes in your scanner’s software. To create a scan 
in Acrobat on the Macintosh and recognize text, do the following:
STEPS: Scanning a text document (Macintosh)
 
1. Place a document on the scanner platen. Be certain your scanner is configured and 
operational.
 
2. Select Document ➪ Scan to PDF. The Acrobat Scan dialog box opens as shown in 
Figure 17.4.
 FIGURE 17.4
Choose Scan to PDF to open the Acrobat Scan dialog box.
 
3. Choose your scanner. Open the Scanner pull-down menu and choose your scanner.
 
4. Leave the settings at the defaults and click Scan. The default settings are set up to cre-
ate a new PDF document and make your text searchable. Leave the settings at the defaults 
and click Scan to open your scanner’s software via the TWAIN driver.
 
5. Set the scan attributes. Make choices for resolution, color mode, and page size in your 
scanner’s interface. In Figure 17.5 you can see a scanner interface that was opened from 
Acrobat using a TWAIN driver.
  
6. Click Scan. Click the Scan button to commence scanning. The converted file opens in 
Acrobat with recognizable text.

Using Acrobat Scan 
(Windows and Macintosh)
There are two different dialog boxes that open when you choose Document ➪ Scan to PDF. For 
WIA-compliant scanners on Windows only, you have a number of different options you can choose 
from within Acrobat. If you use a TWAIN driver that opens your scanner software to create a scan, 
the Acrobat Scan dialog box has much fewer options choices.

576
Editing PDFs
Part III
To differentiate the options, you have scanner settings in either the Custom Scan dialog box (like 
Figure 17.2) or when setting up scan presets using WIA-compliant scanners. If using a TWAIN 
driver, you open the Acrobat Scan dialog box (like Figure 17.4).
Setting options in Acrobat Scan
Beginning at the top of the Acrobat Scan dialog box, as shown in Figure 17.2, Input options you 
have available when using a TWAIN driver include:
 Scanner. The pull-down menu is used to select your scanner. When the scanner is 
online and recognized by Acrobat, you’ll see the scanner plug-in software name appear 
in a pull-down menu. Some scanning software may not enable you to see other options 
such as Color Mode and Resolution in the Acrobat Scan dialog box. If these items are 
not available, you’ll need to make the choices in the scanner plug-in. When you first 
select Acrobat Scan, a dialog box informs you that the Native Scanners Interface can’t 
be hidden. In such a case, you need to make choices in your plug-in software.
 Sides. Choose from Single or Both sides. If your scanner is capable of scanning both sides 
of a paper document, the scan can be completed in one step. If your scanner doesn’t sup-
port two-sided scanning, Acrobat pauses the scan and permits you to turn the paper over 
on the scanner platen.
 Prompt for scanning more pages. Check this box for multiple-pages scanning when 
using scanners without document feeders.
 New PDF Document. Click the radio button to create a scan that opens as a new PDF 
file. If you want to scan multiple pages and create separate new pages for each scan, 
check the Multiple files check box.
 Append to existing file or portfolio. You can append a scan to a file either open in the 
Document pane where you make choices from the pull-down menu, or one you choose 
from your hard drive by clicking the Browse button. You can also add a scan to an exist-
ing PDF Portfolio.

 Optimization. The slider is used to adjust the quality of the scanned image. This quality 
setting has nothing to do with text recognition. Click the Options button to open the 
Optimization Options dialog box as shown in Figure 17.6. The default choice is Automatic. 
When you click Custom Settings, you can make choices for various optimization settings. 
Your choices include:

Scanning and OCR Conversion
17
 FIGURE 17.6
Click Options to open the Optimization Options dialog box.
 Compression. For color/grayscale images, choose from Adaptive or JPEG for file com-
pression. JPEG files result in smaller file sizes, but you experience data loss. In many 
cases the data loss may have no effect on appearance or Acrobat’s ability to recognize 
text. If you do experience problems, try using Adaptive compression.
 
Monochrome images are compressed with three different compression schemes 
depending on the choice made from the pull-down menu. JBIG2 is a JPEG compres-
sion scheme with little data loss. You can also use Adaptive like that used for color/
grayscale images and CCITT Group 4, which is a common compression used by fax 
machines. When applying compression to images, try the defaults (Adaptive for color/
grayscale and JBIG2 for monochrome) first. If your scans are presenting visual prob-
lems or Acrobat has difficulty in recognizing text, experiment with the other settings.
 
You can adjust the quality slider for the amount of compression applied to the scans. 
As you move the slider left, the file size is smaller but the image quality is reduced. 
Move the slider toward Higher if you experience problems with text recognition.
 Deskew. Acrobat automatically straightens crooked scans when Deskew is set to auto-
matic. To turn off the deskewing, select Off from the pull-down menu.
 Background removal. Removes background data. Use this option and choose from 
Low, Medium, High, or Off from menu choices. When text has drop shadows or origi-
nal paper copies show dust and dirt, play with the amount settings to sharpen the text.

578

Part III
 Edge shadow removal. If you want to scan in grayscale or color mode, Acrobat can 
eliminate levels of gray where shadows appear around type. For cleaner text scans, 
enable this option. Note that you need to have crisp, clean originals to see much of a 
difference between scanning with the option enabled versus disabled. Two settings are 
used for Cautious and Aggressive as well as Off. Use Aggressive for more removal.
 Despeckle. This item and descreen are particularly helpful when scanning documents 
that have been printed and are subject to moiré patterns (a condition common when 
scanning printed documents) or when scanning documents with dust and dirt.
 Descreen. Use Descreen like Despeckle mentioned previously when scanning printed 
documents and screened type.
 Halo Removal. Artifacts creating halo effects around type can be cleaned up by setting 
this option to On.
 Make Searchable (Run OCR). You can instruct Acrobat to recognize text using OCR at 
the time a document is scanned. If you disable this check box you can later use a menu 
command to run Acrobat’s OCR engine. Clicking the Options button opens the Recognize 
Text – Settings dialog box shown in Figure 17.7. See “Text recognition options” later in 
this chapter.
 Make PDF/A Compliant. Check this radio button to make a PDF/A-compliant file.

The filtering options you have in Figure 17.6 are also available when choosing 
Document ➪ Optimize Scanned PDF. Choosing this command opens the Optimize 
Scanned PDF dialog box. This menu command offers you an option to optimize scanned docu-
ments after scanning and after adding form fields when scanning forms.
Text recognition options
If scanning for OCR, check the box for Make Searchable (Run OCR). If you want to scan images, 
remove the check mark from this option. For searchable text, you have more choices when you 
click the Options button. Clicking this button opens the Recognize Text – Settings dialog box. As 
shown in Figure 17.7, you have three choices for PDF Output style, which determine how the text 
recognition is performed:
 Primary OCR Language. By default, Acrobat installs 42 language dictionaries available 
for OCR. If you scan documents from any of the supported languages, select the appro-
priate language in the pull-down menu in the Recognize Text – Settings dialog box.

579
Scanning and OCR Conversion
17
 PDF Output Style. From the pull-down menu shown in Figure 17.7, your options are 
as follows:
 ClearScan. In earlier versions of Acrobat, this item was called Formatted Text & 
Graphics. When using the legacy format or the newer ClearScan technology, the bit-
mapped image is discarded and replaced with searchable text and graphics. If there is 
an instance where the OCR engine does not have confidence, the original bitmap is left 
in place and the best guess is placed behind, mimicking the “Searchable Image” style.
 
Formatted Text and Graphics had some problems related to color images. The newer 
ClearScan technology does a much better job of converting scanned images to text and 
file sizes are much smaller.
 Searchable Image. Text is also placed behind the original image, preserving the integ-
rity of the original documents. The image scan is compressed to reduce file size. Some 
of the quality of the original scan is lost.
 Searchable Image (Exact). This option keeps the image scan in the foreground with 
text placed in the background. The appearance of the scanned image does not change. 
Text is added on a hidden layer that gives you the capability of creating indexes and 
performing searches. Use this option when you don’t want to change a document’s 
appearance, but you do want to be able to search the text of that document. Something 
on the order of a legal document or a certificate might be an example of such a docu-
ment. This option produces the largest file sizes.
NOTE
NOTE
See the “Searchable Images Versus ClearScan” sidebar in this chapter for more 
detail on the differences among the PDF output styles.
 Downsample Images. This option enables you to downsample images or keep them at 
the original scanned resolution. If None is selected, no downsampling is applied to images. 
The remaining options offer downsampling values at 600 dots per inch (dpi), 300 dpi, 
150 dpi, and 72 dpi.
 FIGURE 17.7
Open the PDF Output Style pull-down menu and choose from one of three options for 
performing the OCR.
After you make choices in the Recognize Text – Settings dialog box and click OK, you return to the 
Acrobat Scan dialog box. When you click Scan or choose Document ➪ OCR Text Recognition ➪ 
Recognize Text Using OCR, the last settings you made in the Recognize Text – Settings dialog box 
are used by the OCR engine.

580
Editing PDFs
Part III
Searchable Image Versus ClearScan
W
hen you search OCR pages with either Searchable Image (Exact) or Searchable Image, the 
pages are image files with searchable text. The original file is an image file produced from 
your scan designed to be viewed as an original, unaltered document. This option enables you 
to electronically archive documents for legal purposes or when unaltered originals need to be 
preserved.
When you convert a document with Recognize Text Using OCR, the OCR conversion places text 
behind the scan. The intent is for you to be able to archive files and search them either through using 
the Search panel to search files on your hard disk or by searching an index where these documents 
have been catalogued.
The text behind PDF Image is not editable with Acrobat. However, Adobe Acrobat Capture 3.0 does 
have tools to edit text in a PDF Image file. If Recognize Text Using OCR misinterprets a word, you 
cannot make corrections to the text. The text is selectable, and you can copy the text and paste it 
into a word processor or text editor. If you want to examine the OCR suspects, paste the text into a 
word processor and review the document. Or buy a copy of Adobe Acrobat Capture 3.0 to do the 
edits from within the PDF file.
To copy text from a PDF Image format, select the Select tool. Click the cursor anywhere in the text 
and choose Edit ➪ Select All (Ctrl/Ô+A). Open a context menu and select Copy File to Clipboard. 
Open a word processor and choose Edit ➪ Paste. You may find the number of suspects to be too 
many to be usable. If you want to improve the OCR conversion, return to the Create PDF from 
Scanner dialog box and rescan the file with a higher resolution or different scanning mode.
ClearScan files (previously referred to as PDF Formatted Text & Graphics in Acrobat 6 and later) are 
scanned documents converted to text. When you select ClearScan in the Recognize Text dialog box, 
the file conversion is made to a PDF with scalable text and graphics. Recognize Text reads the bit-
map configuration of words and converts them to text. This text can be edited and altered on a page. 
When you make text corrections, you see the changes reflected on the document page.
When capturing pages, be certain to view the options and know the difference between capturing 
pages as PDF Scanned Image and ClearScan documents.
Using WIA Scan Drivers (Windows)
If you have a WIA-compliant scanner, your options for scanning from within Acrobat are much 
more plentiful than using the Acrobat Scan 5-button scan operation. Acrobat Scan has been greatly 
simplified in Acrobat 9 and the number of options you have are, although very simple, much fewer 
than using Scan to PDF on Windows.
Working with presets
Presets are settings you can configure and retain to perform scans with a set of options that you 
define or that Adobe creates as a series of defaults.

581
Scanning and OCR Conversion

NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
Acrobat 9 provides you with several presets used with black and white, grayscale, 
and color documents, and with color images. The settings for scanning each of 
these types of documents are preset for you. You can use them out of the box, or you can con-
figure each preset for your own personal needs.
Adobe’s intent is to help you simplify your scanning and OCR recognition by setting up some gen-
eral options that apply for scanning a range of original document types. However, you may have 
some special needs. For example, you may be scanning a different paper size than the default choice 
for one of the scanning presets, or you may want to scan at a different resolution than the choice 
added to a given preset. If this is the case, you’ll want to change a preset to suit your own personal 
scanning needs.
Take a quick look at some of the options you have available when you first start a scan. Choose 
Document ➪ Scan to PDF and the submenu opens as shown in Figure 17.8. From the menu choices 
you have the four preset choices, a choice for Custom Scan, and a choice for Configure Presets. The 
Custom Scan choice is provided in case you have a scan where you want to deviate from all the pre-
sets and choose your options prior to a scan — more like a one-time use. The last item in the sub-
menu is Configure Presets. Choose this option to configure any one of the first four presets listed 
in the menu.
 FIGURE 17.8
Choose Document ➪ Scan to PDF to open the submenu where the preset commands are listed.
To edit a preset, do the following:
STEPS: Editing a preset
 
1. Choose Document ➪ Scan to PDF ➪ Configure Presets. The Configure Presets dialog 
box opens as shown in Figure 17.9.
 
2. Choose your scanner. Open the Scanner pull-down menu and choose the scanner you 
want to use. If you have multiple scanners, all scanners configured properly appear in 
the menu.
 
3. Choose the preset you want to edit. From the Presets pull-down menu choose the 
preset you want to edit as shown in Figure 17.9.

4. Change the attributes. From the options shown in the Configure Presets dialog box, use 
the menus and text boxes to make the changes you want for the preset. In my example I 
edited Resolution and changed my scanner’s default A4 paper size to US Letter. For more 
detail on the options, see the section earlier in this chapter “Setting options in Acrobat Scan.”
 
5. Save the settings. Click the Save button to apply your new settings to the preset. The 
next time you want to scan a document with the new preset, choose Document ➪ Scan

want to start over, simply open the Configure Presets dialog box and choose your edited preset. 
Click the Defaults button to change the options back to the originally installed preset choices.

Creating a custom scan
For an occasional scan where options don’t exist in one of your presets, you may want to use the 
Document ➪ Scan to PDF ➪ Custom Scan command. Choosing this option opens the Custom Scan 
dialog box shown earlier in Figure 17.2.
When you perform a scan using the Custom Scan dialog box, you need to address the choices in 
the dialog box before clicking the Scan button. If you find yourself scanning routinely using the 
Custom Scan dialog box, open the Configure Presets dialog box and edit a preset.
Setting scanner options
In both the Configure Preset and Custom Scan dialog box you find a button for Options adjacent 
to the Scanner pull-down menu. Click this button to open the Scanner Options dialog box (Figure 
17.10) where you can make some choices for the transfer method and user interface.
 FIGURE 17.10
Click the Options button adjacent to the Scanner pull-down menu to open the Scanner Options dialog box.
For the Transfer Method you can choose Native Mode or Memory Mode from the pull-down menu. 
Both modes prompt you to save your file in a Save dialog box. For faster scanning of multiple 
pages, choose the Memory Mode option.
For User Interface, choose between options in Acrobat or your scanner’s interface. To use the options 
in the presets and the Custom Scan dialog box, you’ll want to choose Hide Scanner’s Native 
Interface. If the pull-down menu is grayed out, you are forced to use your scanner’s interface.
The Invert Black and White Images check box is used for scanning white text on a black background. 
This option is a likely candidate for using the Custom Scan menu choice if you have an occasional 
piece of artwork designed with white text on a black background. You wouldn’t want to change 
a preset if this type of artwork is used infrequently when scanning.
Appending scans to files and portfolios
You can open an existing PDF document or PDF Portfolio or choose a file stored on your hard drive 
and append scans to the document(s). In the Custom Scan dialog box (or when configuring a preset) 
or when using Acrobat Scan, click the Append to existing file or portfolio radio button.

If you have a document or portfolio open in the document pane, the Select path shows the open 
document’s directory path by default. You can change the path and select another document by 
clicking the Browse button.
When you scan to a PDF Portfolio, Acrobat prompts you in a dialog box to name your file. Type a 
name to perform the scan. The file is saved using the filename you add to the Acrobat Scan dialog 
box shown in Figure 17.11 and appended to a PDF Portfolio. If you scan to a file, the new scan is 
appended to the selected document and there is no need to type a name for the new scan.

Creating Workflow Solutions
Scanning individual pages for limited use can easily be handled by the methods described in this 
chapter. As you scan documents, you need to attend to feeding papers under the scanner lid and 
manually clicking buttons to continue scanning. If you need to convert large numbers of pages to 
digital content, you may want to explore other solutions. Depending on how much money you 
want to spend, you may want to invest in a commercial-grade scanner with a document feeder.
Some scanners support automatic document feeders. If your workflow demands scanning volumes 
of papers, acquiring a good scanner with an automatic document feeder is a great advantage. When 
you scan in Acrobat, scanned pages are successively appended to a PDF. Therefore, you can leave a 
stack of papers in the scanner feeder and leave it unattended. Scanning can be performed automat-
ically overnight. When you return to your computer, the PDF file is complete with recognized text 
and ready for saving to your hard disk.

585

TIP
TIP
If you scan using a document feeder, open the Preferences and click Documents 
in the left pane. In the right pane, click Automatically save document changes to 
temporary file every [1]. Type 1 in the text box to save your updates every minute. If the scanning 
operation crashes, you may be able to rescue the file up to the last minute when pages were 
appended to the document.
A more expensive solution, but not out of the question for workflows needing automated means of 
capturing pages, is to purchase Adobe’s stand-alone product, Adobe Acrobat Capture. Combined 
with a scanner and document feeder, the conversion of scanned images to text is handled in a single 
operation. You have other solutions from third-party vendors that support industrial-strength scan-
ning and OCR conversion with the capability of converting the final file to PDF format.
PDF WORKFLOW
PDF WORKFLOW Users in government and educational workflows seeking to scan volumes of text for 
document accessibility will find purchasing auto document feeding scanners and 
Adobe Acrobat Capture, or other software capable of batch scanning and OCR conversion, to 
be a much more effective means for converting publications and documents to accessible PDFs. 
Some hardware screen readers use proprietary software to read TIFF image files for document 
accessibility. Acrobat PDF is a much better solution over TIFF images and proprietary formats, 
because once converted to PDF, the document content is searchable and much smaller. If scan-
ning textbooks and government papers is your task, PDF is a much better file format for docu-
ment accessibility.
Using Text Recognition
You may have files scanned as image files and want to convert them to recognizable text, which is 
similar to performing OCR tasks in earlier versions of Acrobat. You handle scanning and OCR rec-
ognition in one of two ways in Acrobat. You can scan a document and run the OCR recognition in 
one step, or you can scan documents, save them as PDF files, and later use Acrobat to run the OCR 
recognition. The latter case might use other scanning programs such as a Photoshop plug-in or a 
dedicated scanning tool to perform the scans.
If you don’t have a scanner or you’re looking for a more efficient way to scan documents and rec-
ognize text, you can use a digital camera and a copy stand. A digital camera fires off images ten to 
one over a flatbed scanner, and you can import the images directly into Acrobat and run the Text 
Recognition command. If using a digital camera be certain to shoot JPEG images and not Camera 
Raw. Acrobat converts JPEGs to PDF via the Create PDF From File or the Merge Files into a Single 
PDF commands. Camera Raw conversion is not supported.
If you have scanned image files or digital camera files and you want to convert to searchable text, 
perform the following steps:

Understanding suspect words
A suspect word is one that the OCR engine interprets differently from the closest match found in 
the Primary OCR Language Dictionary. The word is suspect because it doesn’t have a match in the 
Primary OCR Language Dictionary. You might have proper names, industry terminology, abbrevia-
tions, and so on that the OCR engine marks as suspects. Simply because the word(s) is marked as a 
suspect doesn’t necessarily require changing the word. Therefore, when you review suspects, you 
have two choices: Either change the word to a correct spelling or inform Acrobat to leave it as is 
and move to the next suspect.
After the Recognize Text dialog box closes, the converted page(s) doesn’t appear any different from 
before you began the OCR conversion. In order to see any words that may have been misinterpreted 
during the conversions, you need to access a menu command and tell Acrobat you want to view the 
suspect words. You have two choices in the OCR Text Recognition submenu.
NOTE
NOTE
In order to correct OCR suspects in Acrobat, you need to convert pages with the 
ClearScan output style.

590
Editing PDFs
Part III
If you choose Document ➪ OCR Text Recognition ➪ Find First OCR Suspect, Acrobat shows the 
first word that it interprets as a suspect, which means the interpretation of the OCR engine did not 
exactly match a word in its dictionary. The suspect word is highlighted in the document pane.
If you choose Document ➪ OCR Text Recognition ➪ Find All OCR Suspects, all the suspect words 
are highlighted with a red border across all pages converted. At a glance you can see the number of 
suspects that need to be reviewed.
TIP
TIP
When examining suspect words you should plan on zooming in to the suspects. If 
you prefer to view a page in a zoomed-out view, select the Loupe tool to zoom in 
on suspect words. You can keep the page view smaller while zooming in on suspects with the 
Loupe tool.
To leave a word unedited, you can choose either Find Next or Accept and Find. If the OCR 
engine recognized a graphic (such as a signature) as text, you can also select “Not Text” to return 
it to the original bitmap image. If you choose Find Next, the bitmap image of the text stays in 
place and the text behind the bitmap stays as is. When you click the Accept and Find button, the 
bitmap is thrown away and the word behind the bitmap is promoted to the text location. As you 
work with the text corrections, realize that you have two layers. The bitmap is the scanned image, 
and Recognize Text created the text below the scanned image. Therefore, as you edit the text cor-
rections you can choose to throw away the bitmap image on top of the text layer or choose to pre-
serve it. To make a correction, edit a suspect word and click Accept and Find. The new text you 
edited is promoted to the text layer while the bitmap is thrown away.
PDF WORKFLOW
PDF WORKFLOW If you want to develop a workflow in an office environment, you may want to have 
several machines perform the function of scanning documents and have other com-
puters perform OCR functions. You can scan images in software such as Adobe Photoshop and 
save your files in either an image format or as Photoshop PDFs. The scans can be routed to other 
workstations used for the OCR conversion.
Reducing suspects
When you begin a new Acrobat session and want to scan many pages with OCR Text Recognition, 
scanning one or two pages representative of the pages you want to convert and examining the 
number of suspects in your sample scan is a good idea. If the suspects outnumber the number of 
correct interpretations, editing the suspect words could take you more time than typing the docu-
ment in a word processor. At some point the ratio between the number of suspects to correct 
words can make capturing pages more of a burden than a solution.
If the number of suspect words is extraordinary, you may want to scan another few pages using 
different settings. For example, increase the image resolution or scan in a different color mode. 
Change the attributes in the Acrobat Scan dialog box or adjust settings in your Acquire plug-in to 
produce scans more suitable for capturing pages. Run Text Recognition and examine the suspects. 
When a scan results in fewer suspects, you can then go about scanning the remaining pages. In

Figure 17.16, I scanned a page at 200 ppi and converted the page with Recognize Text Using OCR. 
After viewing the number of suspects, I decided to scan the page again with a higher resolution. 
The results of my OCR suspects with a higher resolution (600 ppi) were significantly reduced, as 
you can see in Figure 17.17.
 FIGURE 17.16
I scanned a page using Create PDF From Scanner and converted it with Recognize Text Using OCR. After I 
chose Document ➪ OCR Text Recognition ➪ Find All OCR Suspects, I determined that the number of sus-
pects made this job too difficult to edit in Acrobat.

Exporting OCR text
If you want to take your scanned text to a word processor for editing and integration with other 
text documents, Acrobat provides an easy way to transfer data to word processors. After scanning a 
document with Scan to PDF with Make Searchable (Run OCR) or after running Text Recognition 
Using OCR on an image file, follow these steps to export your text to Microsoft Word.

STEPS: Exporting recognized text to Microsoft Word
 
1. Export text. After recognizing text, choose File ➪ Export ➪ Word Document. Note that 
you can also choose Rich Text Format (RTF) if you want to import the text in another 
application.
 
2. Save the file. A Save As dialog box opens. Choose a target location and type a file name 
in the Save As dialog box. Click Save to save the file in Microsoft Word format.
 
3. Launch Microsoft Word.
 
4. Open the Word file. Click the Microsoft Office button and choose Open. Locate the saved 
file and open it in Word. The text is shown with formatting as you see in Figure 17.18.

Scanning Paper Forms
If you scan paper forms that you want populated with form fields in Acrobat or Adobe LiveCycle 
Designer and you want to use auto field detection in Acrobat, you need to start with a form that 
has sufficient resolution for the form fields to be recognized by Acrobat. If the resolution and 
image contrast isn’t sufficient for Acrobat to recognize form fields, your results will vary and you 
may often find very few fields created by Acrobat on low-resolution scans.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on auto field detection in Acrobat, see Chapter 34. For more 
information on creating forms in Adobe LiveCycle Designer, see Chapter 33.
Developing a workflow for scanning forms using your scanner and Acrobat requires some practice 
and testing. Scanners vary considerably with quality, options, and resolution choices. The first thing 
you need to do is run a series of tests to determine what settings are optimum for recognizing fields 
automatically in Acrobat. Some considerations include:
 Resolution. More is generally better when it comes to scanning forms. Almost all desktop 
scanners support two resolutions. Optical resolution is the true resolution of your scan-
ner. You may have a 600-ppi (pixels per inch) scanner that supports an optical resolution 
of 600 ppi. Your scanner also supports an interpolated resolution. For the 600-ppi scan-
ner, the interpolated resolution is likely to be 1200 ppi. A 1200-ppi optical resolution 
scanner often supports an interpolated resolution of 2400 ppi, and so on.
 
Interpolated resolution is best suited for line art drawings. Because most office forms are 
black and white, your scan resolution for forms at the highest interpolated resolution 
(up to 1200 ppi) of your scanner usually produces the best results when it comes to rec-
ognizing form fields. In Figure 17.19 you can see three scans I created using Scan to PDF. 
The form on the left is a 150-ppi scan. In the middle is a 300-ppi scan and on the right is 
a 600-ppi scan. Although auto field detection isn’t perfect, you can see that the 600-ppi 
scan produced more fields when the command was run in Acrobat.
NOTE
NOTE
The sample form used in these figures is a complex form having rows and columns 
of fields. Auto field detection provides you with a start in a complex form. You can 
expect to do some editing in Acrobat or Adobe LiveCycle Designer to polish up the fields and 
add fields where the auto recognition of form fields missed adding fields to the form. In much 
simpler forms, the auto field detection command does a superb job of automatically populating 
a form. See Chapter 34 for more on auto field detection.
 Color Mode. Black and white art is generally scanned in a line art (bitmap) color mode. 
However, when it comes to OCR Text Recognition and ultimately using auto field detec-
tion, the anti-aliasing of grayscale scans most often provides you with better results.

595

 FIGURE 17.19
Three scans after selecting Forms ➪ Add or Edit Fields and using auto field detection. On 
the left is a 150-ppi scan, in the middle is a 300-ppi scan, and on the right is a 600-ppi 
scan. The scans were performed on a scanner with an optical resolution of 600 ppi and 
an interpolated resolution of 1200 ppi.
 Make Searchable (Run OCR). When you use Scan to PDF for scanning forms on which 
you want to use the auto field detection, be certain to check the box for Make Searchable 
(Run OCR) in the Acrobat Scan dialog box. (See Figure 17.1 earlier in this chapter.) Using 
auto field detection produces no results if you attempt to run the command on a scan 
that hasn’t been converted with the OCR engine.
TIP
TIP
Note that ClearScan works well for documents you intend to view in Acrobat. 
However, forms, and especially forms with check boxes, might be best scanned 
using Searchable Image. If ClearScan is picking up check boxes and converting the check boxes 
to fonts, change the PDF output style to Searchable Image.
 Clean Up. Ideally, you’re best off using Scan to PDF and achieve optimum results using 
the controls in your scanner software for brightness, contrast, color mode choices, and 
scanning resolution. However, if your scanner software doesn’t produce good results when 
recognizing form fields on your scans, you may be able to do a little image editing to 
adjust brightness and contrast. You’ll need a program like Adobe Photoshop or Adobe 
Photoshop Elements to adjust Levels (Photoshop and Elements) and Curves (Photoshop 
only).
 
If you do plan to do some image editing to adjust your scans’ brightness and contrast, 
turn off Make Searchable (Run OCR) if using Scan to PDF. After editing a scan in 
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, save as a Photoshop PDF file, open in Acrobat, and 
choose Document ➪ OCR Text Recognition ➪ Recognize Text Using OCR. After running 
the OCR engine, you can then choose Forms >> Add or Edit Fields.

596
Editing PDFs
Part III
TIP
TIP
If the quality of your original forms is poor and you can’t adjust contrast in Photoshop 
or Elements sufficiently to convert text with the OCR Engine and ultimately recognize 
fields, you can use Photoshop or Photoshop Elements to improve image brightness. Duplicate 
the Background layer in the Layers palette in either program. For the layer’s blending mode, 
change the default Normal to Multiply. Add more duplicate layers using the Multiply blending 
mode until you see enough brightness in areas such as text, lines, boxes, and so on. Flatten the 
layers and make your final adjustments in the Levels dialog box.
Plan to do a lot of testing if you need to scan many forms and populate them with form fields in 
Acrobat or Adobe LiveCycle Designer. Try scanning forms with different resolutions to pinpoint 
the resolution setting that works best for your forms. After you find the settings that work best, go 
about scanning the forms you need to prepare in Acrobat.
Converting a paper form to a fillable form
When scanning forms, you can use a one-button action to perform three steps in your paper form 
conversion to a PDF fillable form. By choosing Forms ➪ Start Form Wizard, the Create or Edit 
Form wizard provides a choice for creating a form from a paper form. When you make the choice, 
Acrobat Scan is used to scan the form, the scan is recognized using the OCR engine, and the form 
is automatically populated with form fields using Acrobat’s ability to auto detect fields on a page.
NOTE
NOTE
The steps to convert a paper form can be completed in Acrobat Standard, Pro, and 
Pro Extended.
To convert a paper form to a fillable form, follow these steps
STEPS: Scanning a Form in Acrobat
 
1. Choose Forms ➪ Start Form Wizard. The Create or Edit Form Wizard opens as shown 
in Figure 17.20.

2. Click A paper form. From the radio button choices, click A paper form and click Next.
 
3. Choose a preset or custom option (WIA-compliant scanners). When you click Next 
in the Create or Edit Form Wizard, an Acrobat Scan dialog box opens as shown in Figure 
17.21. If you have a preset already created for scanning forms, click the option (Black 
and White or Grayscale). If you want to adjust scan options, click Custom. In the Custom 
Scan dialog box make your choices for scan options.
 FIGURE 17.21
Click a preset or click Custom.
 
 If scanning using a TWAIN driver, your scanner software opens where you make your 
scan adjustments.
 
4. Click Scan. If you choose a preset, your scan commences and you don’t need this step. If 
setting up a custom scan or using a TWAIN driver, click the scan button in the scanner’s 
interface to start the scan.
 
5. Edit the form. The scan finishes and the OCR engine recognizes text. The document is 
then moved to Form Editing Mode where Acrobat automatically detects fields and popu-
lates the form. In many cases you may need to edit a form such as the form shown in 
Figure 17.22. In this form, Acrobat missed a few fields and the check box fields weren’t 
recognized. The fields are added while you stay in Form Editing Mode.
 
6. Save the form. Preview the form by clicking the Preview button and test the fields. 
When all fields appear on the form, choose File ➪ Save to save the form.
NOTE
NOTE
When you open a scan in Form Editing Mode, Acrobat prompts you in a dialog box 
to use Run Form Field Recognition. Click Yes in the Add or Edit Form Fields dialog 
box. Acrobat searches the document for the placement of field objects on the form.

Scanning forms for Adobe LiveCycle Designer 
(Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended Windows only)
In earlier versions of Acrobat and LiveCycle Designer, the duties of scanning a form and auto 
detecting fields were the responsibility of LiveCycle Designer. In Acrobat 9, Acrobat takes control 
of the scanning, OCR recognition, and populating a form.
NOTE
NOTE
Adobe LiveCycle Designer is available only in Acrobat Pro and Acrobat Pro 
Extended on Windows.
When you open the Create or Edit Form wizard the only option choice that takes you to LiveCycle 
Designer is No existing form. Click this radio button and click Next to open the New Form Assistant 
wizard shown in Figure 17.23. Notice that this wizard doesn’t have a choice for scanning a paper 
form.

If you want to edit a form in LiveCycle Designer and use a form where you let Acrobat populate 
the form with fields using auto field detection, you need to scan from within Acrobat following the 
steps outlined earlier in the section “Scanning a form in Acrobat.” Exit the Form Editing Mode after 
adding all the fields by clicking the Close Form Editing button shown in Figure 17.22. Save the 
form and choose Forms ➪ Start Form Wizard.
In the Create or Edit Form Wizard, choose No existing form and click Next. This choice opens 
LiveCycle Designer and the New Form Assistant Wizard shown in Figure 17.23. Click Import a 
PDF Form and click Next. Add the Submit and Print buttons in the next pane and click Finish. 
The form with the fields added in Acrobat opens in LiveCycle Designer. From here, you can use 
Designer to add additional fields and modify the form.

Using a digital camera in lieu of a scanner
If you have a number of forms you want to scan from paper and convert to either Acrobat PDF 
forms or Adobe LiveCycle Designer XML forms, you can use a good quality digital camera in lieu 
of a scanner. After properly setting up a camera, you can shoot a dozen paper documents or more 
in the same time as it takes to scan forms — and the ratio broadens when you need to scan forms 
at 1200 ppi or higher.

600
Editing PDFs
Part III
To use a digital camera, you need to consider some of the following:
 Camera type. You may find some point-and-shoot cameras providing you with satisfac-
tory results, but the best results come from a DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) camera 
and a good quality macro lens.
 Copy stand. For best results, either buy or create a makeshift copy stand. Outfit the stand 
with daylight lights and use cross lighting to avoid shadows.
 Save as JPEG and Raw. When running tests with your camera, save files to your camera’s 
media card in JPEG and Camera Raw file formats. You can test the images to see if the 
JPEG files produce good results when running form field recognition. If you don’t get 
the results with JPEG as you do when using Camera Raw images, you can set up some 
defaults in the Camera Raw converter in either Photoshop Elements or Adobe Photoshop 
to automate preparing Raw files for Acrobat.
 Set up an action in Photoshop. If you work with Adobe Photoshop, you can create an 
action to automate image correction and saving files to Photoshop PDF format. You can 
let an action run overnight if you have a huge number of files to convert to PDF forms.
 Set up a nested batch sequence in Acrobat. Two things need to be accomplished 
for preparing forms for editing in Acrobat or Adobe LiveCycle Designer. You need to 
Recognize Text Using OCR and Detect Form Fields. Open the Batch Sequences dialog 
box (Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Batch Sequences) and create a new sequence. 
Select Recognize Text Using OCR and add it to the right pane in the Edit Sequence dialog 
box. Next, select Detect Form Fields in the Edit Sequence dialog box and click the Add 
button to add the item as a second sequence. (See Figure 17.24.)
 
When you finish creating the sequence, the new sequence appears in the Batch Sequences 
dialog box as shown in Figure 17.25. Select the sequence and click Run Sequence. You 
can run the sequence on a folder  of forms to convert the files with the OCR engine and 
add form fields to the documents. You can open the resultant files in either Acrobat or 
Adobe LiveCycle Designer for editing.
 FIGURE 17.24

you save from Photoshop or Photoshop Elements.

NOTE
NOTE
You can use Document ➪ OCR Text Recognition ➪ Recognize Text in Multiple Files 
Using OCR to batch process the OCR function. However, using this command only 
gets you halfway. You still need to set up a batch sequence to use Detect Form Fields to populate 
the scanned forms.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on creating batch sequences, see Chapter 18.
If you have just a few forms, it makes no sense to go through the trouble of setting up a copy stand, 
shooting forms with a digital camera, editing the forms in Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, and 
creating a batch sequence. However, if you have 20, 50, or 100 or more forms to convert from 
paper to electronic forms, you’ll find that using a digital camera can save you more time over scan-
ning forms.
Summary
 Acrobat Scan provides choices for using presets and customizing presets with WIA-
compliant scanners on Windows.
 Create PDF From Scanner on Macintosh and when using noncompliant WIA scanners 
uses TWAIN drivers or Adobe Photoshop Acquire plug-ins.
 Properly preparing the scanner and documents for scanning in Acrobat improves the 
quality of the scans. The scanner platen should be clean, the documents should be straight, 
and the contrast should be sharp.
 When scanning images in Acrobat, use the scanning software to establish resolution, 
image mode, and brightness controls before scanning. Test your results thoroughly to 
create a formula that works well for the type of documents you scan.

602
Editing PDFs
Part III
 Workflow automation can be greatly improved by purchasing Adobe’s stand-alone prod-
uct Adobe Acrobat Capture. When using Adobe Acrobat Capture with a scanner support-
ing a document feeder, the scanning and capturing can be performed with unattended 
operation.
 Acrobat Capture is a stand-alone application for optical character recognition used for 
converting scanned images into editable text.
 Acrobat 9 uses a new technology called ClearScan that replaces the Formatted Text & 
Graphics PDF output style used with earlier versions of Acrobat.
 Text can be converted and saved as a PDF ClearScan output style, where you can edit text 
and change the appearance of the original scan. Text can be converted with Optical 
Character Recognition and saved using the Searchable Image option, which preserves the 
original document appearance and adds a text layer behind the image.
 A new feature in Acrobat 9 enables you to perform OCR text recognition on multiple 
scanned documents saved in any format compatible with the Create PDF From File 
command.
 OCR suspects are marked when the OCR engine does not find an exact word match in its 
dictionary. Text editing is performed in the Find Element dialog box.
 To import text into Microsoft Word, use the File ➪ Export ➪ Word Document command 
in Acrobat to export to a Word file and open the exported file in Microsoft Word.
 Scanned paper forms can be populated with form fields when you enter Form Editing 
Mode. Acrobat automatically uses auto field detection to place field objects on a page 
when you enter Form Editing Mode.
 You can convert a paper form to a fillable PDF form using a single menu command in 
Acrobat.
 Digital cameras can be used in lieu of a scanner and can often speed up the scanning 
process.

603
P
DF documents designed for one purpose, such as for commercial 
printing, might need to be repurposed for other output intent such 
as Web hosting or for copying to CD-ROMs. Rather than going back 
to the original authoring program and recreating PDFs for each purpose, you 
can use tools in Acrobat that enable you to downsample file sizes and strip 
unnecessary content. The resulting documents can then be more efficiently 
viewed on Web sites or exchanged via email.
You may have several files that need to be repurposed or edited in some other 
way using menu commands. Rather than open each file independently and 
apply menu commands, you can create batch sequences that apply commands 
to several files in one operation.
In this chapter, you learn how to repurpose PDF documents using some 
Acrobat tools and methods for downsizing file sizes and eliminating content 
unnecessary for other viewing purposes. In addition, you take a look at auto-
mating tasks by creating batch sequences.
Setting Up the Environment
To downsize files and optimize them for other output circumstances, you 
don’t need to access any special tools. The menu commands offer all the 
means for repurposing files. Therefore, set up your Acrobat work environ-
ment by opening a context menu on the Toolbar Well and selecting Reset 
Toolbars from the menu options.

Reducing File Sizes
Reducing file sizes often occurs with downsampling images — that is to say, reducing the image 
resolution of all raster images or compressing images with higher compression options. In addi-
tion, you can reduce file sizes by eliminating redundant backgrounds; eliminating objects such 
as form fields, comments, Bookmarks, and destinations; unembedding fonts; and/or compressing 
the document structure. You can handle file-size reductions at the time of PDF creation when you 
control file compression, image sampling, and font embedding for PDFs designed for a specific 
output purpose. However, if you create PDFs for one purpose, such as commercial printing, and 
later want to host the same file on a Web site, you need to either create a new PDF document spe-
cifically for the new purpose, or use Acrobat tools to create smaller file sizes more suited for other 
output purposes. Fortunately, several means are available to you for squeezing file sizes down and 
optimizing PDFs for multiple purposes.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on understanding terms such as “downsampling” and 
“resampling,” see Chapter 10.
Using the Reduce File Size command
All Products (Standard, Pro, Pro Extended) offer a menu command that enables you to reduce file 
sizes. Open a document and choose Document ➪ Reduce File Size. The Reduce File Size dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 18.1.
 FIGURE 18.1
Choose Document ➪ Reduce File Size to open the Reduce File Size dialog box, where you select options 
for Acrobat version compatibility.
The Reduce File Size dialog box offers a pull-down menu with options for selecting Acrobat 
compatibility. The default is Retain existing, which means that the original PDF compatibility 
will not be changed when the file is reduced in size. If your PDF documents are to be viewed by 
Acrobat users of version 4 or later, choose the Acrobat 4 and later compatibility. If all users are 
using Acrobat 6 through 9 viewers, use Acrobat 6, 7, 8, or 9 compatibility, respectively. You might 
use Acrobat 4 compatibility for printing purposes because all the transparency will be flattened in 
Acrobat 4–compatible files.

CAUTION 
CAUTION
If you want to use many of the features available in Adobe Reader 8 and 9, such as 
commenting and markup and form field saving, you must use Acrobat 8 compatibil-
ity or greater. If you want to use the new features for viewing PDF Portfolios, you need to use 
Acrobat 9 compatibility. For more information on using Adobe Reader with usage rights enabled, 
see Chapter 19. For information on commenting, see Chapter 20. For more information on PDF 
Portfolios, see Chapter 12.
After you make the menu selection and click OK, the Save As dialog box opens. Provide a filename 
and save the file to disk. As a matter of practice it’s a good idea to write a new file to disk in case the 
file reduction fails and you need to return to the original file to try another method of file reduction.
Examining documents
PDF files can contain artifacts and unnecessary elements that were either left behind from the origi-
nal authoring program or that are not necessary for viewing content on the Web or screen viewing.
NEW FEATURE

To determine if unnecessary elements are contained in a file, you can examine the 
document using the Examine Document panel. Although the Examine Document 
command is not new to Acrobat Pro or Pro Extended, the way the information is displayed has 
changed from a dialog box that was used in Acrobat 8 to a new panel in the Navigation pane in 
Acrobat 9 as you can see in Figure 18.2. To open the panel, choose Document ➪ Examine 
Document.

Eliminating some items can help reduce your file size. To see how items are eliminated from a PDF 
file, follow these steps.
STEPS: Eliminating items from a PDF file
 
1. Open a PDF in Acrobat. Try to use a file that was created with Acrobat 7 or greater 
compatibility and contains several high-resolution images. Check the file size by opening 
the Document Properties dialog box (Ctrl/Ô+D). Click the Description tab and note the 
file size.
 
2. Examine the document. Select Document ➪ Examine Document to open the Examine 
Document panel shown in Figure 18.2.
 
3. Preview the file. Open the Options menu in the panel and choose Expand all. Items listed 
in the panel appear similar to bookmarks where you can expand individual items and 
collapse them by clicking the icon adjacent to an item name (+/- symbol on Windows or 
left/down-pointing arrows on the Mac).
 
4. Search for hidden text. Click Preview under the Hidden Text item to display any hidden 
text in your document. A dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 18.3, after clicking Show 
Preview. Click the Show Only Hidden Text radio button and scroll through the document 
by clicking on the arrow buttons. Reexamine the file by clicking Show Both Hidden and 
Visible Text and scroll through the pages. Showing both visible and hidden text gives you 
an idea for the location of any hidden text on pages.
 FIGURE 18.3
Using the Preview, you can locate hidden text in a file.

5. Remove items. Click OK in the Preview window and you return to the Examine Document 
dialog box. Click Remove to remove all the items checked in the Examine Document 
panel. You are prompted to confirm the action in a dialog box as shown in Figure 18.4. 
Click OK and the checked items are removed from the document.
 FIGURE 18.4
A dialog box opens prompting you to confirm removing items.
 
6. Save the file. A progress bar is displayed as Acrobat removes the checked items. Wait until 
the progress finishes and choose File ➪ Save As and save the file under a new filename.
 
7. Check the file size. Press Ctrl/Ô+D to open the Document Properties dialog box. Click 
Description tab and check the file size. (See Figure 18.5.) You should notice a reduction 
in file size. The amount of the reduction depends on the elements contained in the origi-
nal file and how much was eliminated. In some cases, your file size reduction may be 
very slight.
 FIGURE 18.5
Check the file size in the Description properties.
Using PDF Optimizer (Acrobat Pro/Extended only)
Examining documents and eliminating items supported in the Examine Document dialog box 
might get you only a slight file reduction. A more aggressive tool is the PDF Optimizer that can 
significantly reduce file sizes — especially files with high-resolution images.

608
Editing PDFs
Part III
With PDF Optimizer you make the choices from a number of different settings in the PDF Optimizer 
dialog box for what data is affected during optimization. The PDF Optimizer also offers you an 
option for analyzing a file so you can see what part of the PDF document occupies higher percent-
ages of memory.
For a fast look at how to use the PDF Optimizer, use the steps that follow. Later in this chapter, 
I’ll point out the various options you have when using the PDF Optimizer.
STEPS: Using PDF Optimizer
 
1. Open a PDF file in Acrobat. Try to use the same file you used in the section “Examining 
documents” earlier in this chapter. If you followed the steps in that section, you should 
know the current file size of the document you saved in Step 7.
 
2. Open the PDF Optimizer. Select Advanced ➪ PDF Optimizer to open the dialog box 
shown in Figure 18.6.
 
3. Downsample images. The PDF Optimizer has a number of different panes that offer 
settings for a number of different file attributes. The opening pane has options for down-
sampling files. Where you see Color Images and Grayscale Images you find text boxes 
where sampling amounts are edited. Type 72 and 108 for the sampling amounts for both 
sets of text boxes, as you see in Figure 18.6.
 FIGURE 18.6
Downsample files to 72 ppi for all images above 108 ppi.

18
 
 Click on the listed items on the left side of the dialog box, and you are offered a number 
of other choices for changing and removing data. For now, just use the defaults after 
changing the resolution amounts for color and grayscale images.
 
4. Save the file. Click OK and you are prompted to save your file. Type a new filename and 
click Save. The PDF Optimizer displays a progress bar as it optimizes the file.
 
5. Examine the file size. After the PDF Optimizer completes its task, open the Description 
properties. Press Ctrl/Ô+D and check the file size. You should see a substantial reduction 
in file size.
When you want to get the most out of reducing file sizes, you’ll note that you can use both PDF 
Optimizer and Examine Document. Whether you first use one or the other method is unimportant. 
The final results are exactly the same file size.
TIP
TIP
You can also open the PDF Optimizer when saving files. Select File ➪ Save As and 
choose Save as Optimized from the Save as type (Windows) or Format (Macintosh) 
pull-down menu when the Save As dialog box opens. Click the Settings button in the Save As 
dialog box and the PDF Optimizer window opens. You can choose a preset or make custom set-
tings for the way you want to optimize your file. Click Save and the file is optimized and saved to 
disk. (For more on saving files, see Chapter 11.)
Auditing space usage
As a matter of practice, the first step you want to perform when optimizing files with the PDF 
Optimizer is to analyze a file so you can see what content occupies the larger amounts of memory. 
Analyzing a document and using the PDF Optimizer are handled in the PDF Optimizer dialog box, 
which opens when you choose Advanced ➪ PDF Optimizer and is shown in Figure 18.6.
Click the button labeled Audit space usage. Depending on the size and complexity of the docu-
ment, the analysis can take a little time. When the analysis completes, the dialog box shown in 
Figure 18.7 opens.
In the example shown in the preceding figure, notice that most of the document space is used for 
document overhead (69.95%) with Images occupying the second largest space at 23.62%. Document 
overhead might include items such as Named Destinations and links, while Images contains the 
space for image files. If the image resolution in this document is higher than images suited for screen 
viewing at 72 pixels per inch (ppi), then downsampling the images by reducing resolution would 
compact the file and make it significantly smaller. If you have documents designed for print and 
want to repurpose the documents for Web viewing, image downsampling is likely to be one of the 
things you’ll want to adjust in the PDF Optimizer.

610

Part III
 FIGURE 18.7
After the analysis is completed, the Audit Space Usage dialog box opens, where space usage according to 
different objects/elements is reported as a percentage of the total space.
Optimizing files
Using the PDF Optimizer, you control a number of different attributes that contribute to a docu-
ment’s structure and content. By adjusting the number of different options found in the PDF 
Optimizer dialog box, you have the opportunity to produce documents much smaller than when 
using the Examine Document menu command. The options found in the PDF Optimizer include a 
Settings option, an option for changing PDF compatibility, and categories listed on the left side of 
the dialog box. Click on one of the items listed in the left pane and the right pane changes much 
like when using the Preferences dialog box. These categories include Images, Fonts, Transparency, 
Discard Objects, Discard User Data, and Clean Up.

This item appears first in the PDF Optimizer, but it’s the last setting you address. When you open 
the PDF Optimizer, the default is Standard. Select Custom or make changes to any setting and the 
Save button becomes active. When you click Save, Acrobat prompts you to save your new settings 
as a preset. After saving, the name you define for the preset is added to the pull-down menu. When 
you return to the PDF Optimizer in another Acrobat session, you can select from the number of dif-
ferent presets and click OK to optimize files with the same settings defined for the respective preset.

If you want to clear a preset from the pull-down menu, select a preset in the menu and click the 
Delete button.
Make compatible with
From a pull-down menu you select Acrobat compatibility levels. You can make your optimized 
document compatible with Acrobat 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The Retain existing menu command keeps 
the compatibility the same as the source file. When the need arises to serve users with earlier com-
patibility files, change the menu command to the desired compatibility level. By default, Retain 
Existing is selected in the menu. If you change from Acrobat 5 to Acrobat 6 or 7, some other attribute 
settings in the PDF Optimizer change to reflect choices supported by newer versions of Acrobat.
Images
To reduce file size with the PDF Optimizer, use the first set of options found in the left pane; the 
default Images pane appears, as shown in Figure 18.6. You can make choices for downsampling 
color, grayscale, and bitmap images by typing values in the field boxes for the sampling amounts 
desired. To the right of the downsampling amount, another field box is used to identify images 
that are downsampled. This box instructs Acrobat to look for any image above the setting defined 
in the field box and downsamples the file to the amount supplied in the first field box.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
The Images pane offers choices for the downsampling method. The default method 
is Bicubic Downsampling. Leave the choice for Bicubic Downsampling at the default 
selection. To learn more about the other methods and what they mean, see Chapter 10.
The Compression pull-down menu offers choices for Retain existing, JPEG, JPEG2000 (an addi-
tional setting available when Acrobat 6 through 9 compatibility is selected), and Zip compression. 
The Retain existing setting honors the original compression used when the PDF was created.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on the JPEG, JPEG2000, and Zip file formats, see Chapter 7.
For either form of JPEG compression you have additional choices for the amount of compression 
from the Quality pull-down menu. If you choose a JPEG compression and use Minimum for the 
Quality choice, your images may appear severely degraded. As a general rule, Medium quality 
results in satisfactory image quality for Web hosting. If you try one setting and the images look too 
degraded, you can return to the original file, apply a different Quality setting, and then examine 
the results.
Zip compression is a lossless compression scheme, which means that files are compressed without 
data loss. For Acrobat 4 and 5 compatibility, Zip offers a good choice when you want to maximize 
image quality. When using Acrobat 6 through 9 compatibility, you can select JPEG2000 for a bet-
ter compression result and select Lossless from the Quality pull-down menu, which will save all 
the image data.

Fonts
Fonts won’t always appear in a list in the Fonts pane when you click the word Fonts on the left 
side of the PDF Optimizer. Only fonts that are available for unembedding are listed on the left side 
of the Fonts pane. If no fonts appear in the list, you can move on to the Transparency settings. If 
fonts are listed in the box in the left side of the pane, select the fonts to unembed and click the 
Unembed button adjacent to the right chevron.
In the right box are fonts listed for unembedding. If you want to keep the font embedded, select 
it in the right box and click the Retain button adjacent to the left chevron. To select multiple fonts 
in either window, press Shift+click to select a list in a contiguous group, or press Ctrl/Ô+click to 
select fonts in a noncontiguous group.
NOTE
NOTE
By default, always choose to embed fonts in your documents unless you have some 
special reason for wanting to reduce the file size to a minimum and font appear-
ances won’t matter. One of the great things about PDF documents is that they retain the original 
design look, including font appearances, when files are exchanged among computer systems.
Transparency
Transparent images and objects can be flattened in Acrobat 9 for all PDF documents created in 
Acrobat 5 and greater. If you select Acrobat 4 compatibility, transparency is automatically flattened 
because Acrobat 4 compatibility does not support transparency. When you select all other compat-
ibility versions, you have options for flattening the transparency.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on using transparency-flattening settings, see Chapter 32.
Discard Objects
Discarding items such as comments, form actions, JavaScript actions, cross references, and thumb-
nails affects document functionality as you might suspect. If the respective items are eliminated, any 
PDF interactivity created with these items is also eliminated. If you know that one or any group of 
these items won’t have an effect on the way the repurposed document is viewed or printed, enable 
the check boxes for the items you want to remove.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
Acrobat 8 and 9 provide a feature in the Discard Objects pane for flattening form 
fields. For more on using this option see “Redistilling Files” later in this chapter.
Discard User Data
Comments, multimedia, file attachments, hidden layers, and more are listed in the Discard User 
Data pane. Like Discard Objects, if you choose to eliminate the items, the result can affect the way 
PDFs are viewed and remove some interactivity. Pick and choose these items wisely to retain the 
kind of interactive features you want in the resultant file.

safely without affecting the functionality of your document. Select the box for Remove unreferenced

named destinations if the check box is not checked. Settings such as removing invalid Bookmarks, 
links, and destinations won’t affect the document viewing, but removing the unnecessary items 
helps reduce file size. As a matter of practice, leave all the options in this pane checked.
After you make your preferred settings in the PDF Optimizer, click the Save button if you want to 
save the settings as a new preset or click OK to start the optimization process.
Redistilling Files
In each version of Acrobat PDF Bible dating back to version 4 of Acrobat, I’ve included some vari-
ous reasons why you might want to export a PDF file back to PostScript and redistill the file. This 
is often referred to as refrying a PDF.
Before Acrobat 8, you might have used this method of document repurposing when you had a 
number of form fields for which you didn’t need the field objects, but you wanted to retain the 
data within fields in a repurposed document. All previous versions of Acrobat couldn’t perform 
this operation using the PDF Optimizer. In other cases, the PDF Optimizer was broken upon the 
first release of a new Acrobat version. In Acrobat 7, for example, I used the PDF Optimizer on a 
10+MB file and the optimized file turned out a 295MB file. This wasn’t fixed until the release of 
Acrobat 7.05. The only option I had to repurpose my document was to refry the PDF.
Acrobat 8 introduced an option in the PDF Optimizer to flatten form fields. (See Figure 18.8.) 
Doing so retains the form data but discards the field objects. On files with columns and rows of 
fields, you can produce a substantially lower file size after optimizing it and flattening the fields.
 FIGURE 18.8
Acrobat 8 and 9 provide an option to flatten form fields in the PDF Optimizer.
I’m happy to report that the PDF Optimizer seems to be working very well in the first release of 
Acrobat 9. With the flatten form field option and the efficiency of the PDF Optimizer, there now 
appears to be very little reason to export a PDF document to PostScript and distill the PostScript in 
Acrobat Distiller.

For information on creating PostScript files from PDF documents, using Acrobat 
Distiller, and making choices for Adobe PDF Settings, see Chapter 10.

Part III
Obviously it’s impossible to test PDF Optimizer on every kind of file. At times you may find an 
anomaly in a file where the PDF Optimizer just won’t work. I haven’t found it so far in Acrobat 9, 
but it is possible. Therefore, as a last-resort workaround, it may be worthwhile knowing a little 
about exporting to PostScript and using Acrobat Distiller to repurpose a PDF.
As a first effort in repurposing PDF files, users of Acrobat 9 Professional should try the PDF 
Optimizer. If the results don’t satisfactorily downsize a file, you can select File ➪ Save As and 
choose PostScript (*.ps) for the file type. Launch Acrobat Distiller and select a PDF Setting; then 
open the PostScript file to distill it. Note that because Acrobat Standard doesn’t offer the PDF 
Optimizer, this method of repurposing PDF files may be the only option you have.
TIP
TIP
If you have interactive elements in a document such as Bookmarks, form fields, 
destinations, and so on and want to preserve the interactive elements when redis-
tilling PDFs, realize that all such items are lost in the new file created with Acrobat Distiller. To 
regain Bookmarks, form fields, and so on, open the original file in Acrobat. Choose Document ➪ 
Replace Pages. Locate the new file created with Acrobat Distiller in the Select File With New 
Pages dialog box and replace all pages in the file. Choose File ➪ Save As to write a new optimized 
file to disk. The new file uses the optimized pages and the old file’s interactive elements. You’ll 
see a little increase in the file size because of the interactive elements, but the overall file size 
will be much smaller in your new file compared to the original file.
Batch Processing PDF Files
If you have multiple files that need to be refined for distribution on network servers, Web sites, or 
CD-ROM, then you’ll want to create a batch sequence. Batch sequences are a defined series of com-
mands in a specific order that can be run on multiple files. You create the batch sequence from a 
list of executable functions and determine the commands and order of the sequence.
Batch sequences help you automate tasks in Acrobat that might otherwise take considerable time, 
such as manually applying a common set of commands on many different files. After you develop 
one or more sequences, you can run the sequence(s) on selected PDF files, a folder of PDF files, or 
multiple folders of PDF files.
Tasks such as setting opening views of PDF documents, adding document descriptions, adding page 
numbers, or running the PDF Optimizer can be applied to multiple files you might want to distrib-
ute on CD-ROM or on Web sites. Before distributing files, you can run a batch sequence as a final 
step in your production workflow to be sure all files have common attributes.
Knowing Acrobat 9 changes in preset sequences
When you create a batch sequence, you use a predefined set of sequences or Run a JavaScript to 
add a custom sequence. For more information on creating a batch sequence using a predefined 
sequence, see the section “Creating a batch sequence” later in this chapter.

Creating a batch sequence
To create a new sequence, choose Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Batch Processing. The 
Batch Sequences dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 18.9. The dialog box lists several sequences 
that are predefined for you when you install Acrobat. From the list in the dialog box, you can run a 
sequence, edit one of the listed sequences, rename a sequence, or delete any one or more sequences 
from the list. The first button in the dialog box is used to create a new sequence where you choose 
what commands you want to run from a list in other dialog boxes.
 FIGURE 18.9
Choose Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Batch Processing to open the Batch Sequences dialog box.
Click New Sequence and the Name Sequence dialog box shown in Figure 18.10 opens. The first 
step in creating a batch sequence is to provide a name for the sequence. The name supplied in the 
dialog box ultimately is added to the list in the Batch Sequence window. When you want to run 
the sequence you can open the Batch Sequences dialog box, select any one of the sequences you 
added to the list, and click the Run Sequence button.
 FIGURE 18.10
The first step in creating a new sequence is naming the sequence. You add the names of new sequences to 
the list in the Batch Sequences dialog box.

Type a name in the field box and click OK. The next dialog box that opens is the Edit Batch 
Sequence – Initial View dialog box shown in Figure 18.11. Three items are listed in the dialog box. 
The next step (the Batch Sequence dialog box actually lists this step as the first step in creating a 
sequence) is to click the Select Commands button. After you make choices for the commands 
added to the sequence, you are returned to this dialog box to make choices for items 2 and 3 where 
you identify the input location of files and the destination (output) location.
 FIGURE 18.11
The Edit Batch Sequence – Initial View dialog box opens after you provide a name such as Initial View for 
a new sequence. Click the Select Commands button to choose the commands executed in the sequence.
The Edit Sequence dialog box opens for you to make choices for the commands added to your new 
sequence. From the scrollable list on the left side of the dialog box, select a command and click the 
Add button to move the command to the right side of the dialog box. If you want more than one set 
of commands applied to your sequence, select a command and click the Add button; then select 
additional commands and click Add. In this example, I added a command for setting the Initial 
View by adding the Open Options item in the Document list. Click the icon adjacent to the 
sequence command and the options are displayed, as you see in Figure 18.12.

The settings applied for the Initial View are applied globally to files when you run the sequence. 
You can run the sequence on a folder of files if you want the files to share common attributes.
To finish creating your sequence, click OK and click OK again in the Edit Sequence dialog box. 
Your new sequence is added to the Batch Sequences dialog box that opened first when you selected 
Batch Sequences from the Advanced > Document Processing menu.
Setting output options
When you click the Output Options button in the Edit Batch Sequence dialog box, you’ll find 
choices for file naming and output formats as well as file optimization. Select the Output Options 
check box when you create a new sequence in the Edit Batch Sequence dialog box and the Output 
Options dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 18.14.
You can add a suffix or prefix to filenames by clicking the Add To Original Base Name(s) button 
and editing the field boxes for Insert Before and Insert After. If you enter data in the Insert After 
field box the data is added before the filename extension. Select the box for Do not overwrite exist-
ing files to ensure that you won’t inadvertently overwrite the original files.

can make the choice for the text format from the pull-down menu options. Additionally, PostScript, 
EPS, image formats, HTML, and XML formats are available. One great feature introduced in 
Acrobat 8 and available in Acrobat 9 is the option for saving PDF documents compatible with 
specifications such as PDF/A, PDF/X, and PDF/E. Choose one of these formats and you can convert 
a collection of PDFs to a PDF/A, PDF/X, or PDF/E standard.

Running sequences
Presuming you created a sequence and added the new sequence, you can open the Batch Sequence 
dialog box by choosing Advanced ➪ Document Processing > Batch Processing and selecting the 
sequence you want to run. Click the Run Sequence button in the Batch Sequence dialog box and 
the Run Sequence Confirmation dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 18.15.
A list of commands appears in the dialog box where you can review the settings for each command 
by clicking the icon adjacent to the sequence commands to display the settings as discussed earlier 
in this chapter. If all the settings are appropriate for the sequence you want to run, click OK and 
the Select Files to Process dialog box opens. You can select a file or a contiguous or noncontiguous 
group of files by using Shift+click or Ctrl/Ô+Shift and click a folder or a group of folders for pro-
cessing. Click the Select button, and the sequence runs. If you created a sequence to toggle open 
a dialog box for supplying unique data for each file, the dialog boxes open. Make changes in any 
dialog boxes, click the OK buttons, and the sequence continues. Files are saved according to the 
choices you made in the Output Options dialog box or the choice made from the Select output 
location pull-down menu in the Edit Batch Sequence dialog box.
After running a sequence, examine the files to ensure all files are created with the options you 
expect them to have. If there are any errors and you saved the new set of files without overwriting 
the original set, you can edit the sequence and run the edited version on the original files.
Running UI batch sequences
Running batch sequences in the Batch Sequence dialog box is something you might consider out-
side the user interface (UI) that runs via an Acrobat plug-in. You execute these sequences in a con-
trolled environment where all the sequences and batch commands are nested into a single interface.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
New in Acrobat 9 is an extension of batch sequences that are coded as part of the 
Acrobat user interface. They’re hard coded and don’t require you to set up options

At first glance you may not see the new batch operations in Acrobat 9. They may be a little obscure 
since they’re included as new menu commands or appear when you click new buttons in dialog 
boxes. Following is a list of the new batch operations you find in Acrobat 9:
 
Recognize Text in Multiple documents. Choose Document ➪ OCR Text Recognition ➪ 
Recognize Text in Multiple Files Using OCR. Choosing the menu item opens the Paper 
Capture Multiple Files wizard. The wizard is similar in appearance to the Combine Files 
wizard where you choose files to add to a list by selecting options in the Add files pull-
down menu. Choices you have for adding files to the list include Add Files where you 
select individual files in an Open dialog box, Add Folders for adding folders of files, and 
Add Open files for running Acrobat’s OCR on files open in the Document pane.
 
After adding files to a list, click the OK button and the Output Options dialog box opens 
as shown in Figure 18.16. As you can see in Figure 18.16 a number of options are avail-
able for choosing target locations for saved files, file naming conventions, running the 
PDF Optimizer, and various output formats.
 
PDF Creation. Choose File ➪ Create PDF ➪ Batch Create Multiple Files to open the Batch 
Create Multiple Files wizard. You have choices for adding files or folders from the Add 
Files pull-down menu. This new command in Acrobat 9 differs from the Merge Files into 
a Single PDF. Instead of merging files into one PDF document, the Batch Create Multiple 
Files command converts documents to PDF as individual single files. After adding files to 
a list and clicking the OK button, the Output Options dialog box opens where you can 
make some choices for saving files to a target location and specify various file naming 
conventions. Note that the file export options are the same as those found in the File ➪ 
Export submenu and the batch routine described in the next bullet point.

Headers & Footers/Backgrounds/Watermarks. These processing are available in Batch 
Sequences Edit Sequence dialog box. They are now also included in the dialog boxes you 
use for adding Headers & Footers, Backgrounds, and Watermarks.
 
You can add page numbers (or add headers, footers, apply backgrounds, or watermarks) 
to multiple files of your choice. Choose one of the three Document menu commands 
(Header & Footer, Background, or Watermark) and the Add submenu command (for 
example Document ➪ Header & Footer ➪ Add) to open the Add Header & Footer (or 
Background or Watermark) dialog box. The new Apply to Multiple button in the lower 
right corner of the dialog boxes enables you to batch process multiple files with the 
respective task.

Reduce File Size. Although using the PDF Optimizer is the better choice for repurposing 
files as I explain in this chapter, you can choose the Reduce File Size command and pro-
cess multiple files when you need a quick reduction of file sizes for multiple files you 
intend to host on Web sites. Choose Document >> Reduce File Size and you find the 
Apply to Multiple button in the Reduce File Size dialog box.

Editing sequences
If you create a sequence for one purpose and want to modify the sequence for another processing 
venture, you can edit the attributes of a command, add new commands, or delete commands from 
the original sequence. To edit a sequence, choose Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Batch 
Processing. In the Batch Sequences dialog box, select the sequence you want to edit and click the 
Edit Sequence button. The Edit Batch Sequences dialog box opens.
In order to edit the commands, add new commands, or delete commands, you first need to click 
the Select Commands button. The Edit Sequence dialog box opens where you can add new com-
mands or edit existing commands by following the information in the earlier section on creating 
sequences.
If you want to delete a sequence and all the commands associated with the sequence, click the 
Delete Sequence button in the Batch Sequences dialog box. This action removes the sequence from 
the list. If you delete commands in the Edit Sequence dialog box and keep a modified version of a 
sequence listed in the Batch Sequences dialog box, you may want to rename a sequence to more 
closely relate to the modified version. Click the Rename Sequence button in the Batch Sequence 
dialog box and edit the name in the Name Sequence dialog box.

Part III
Creating custom sequences
The batch sequences you create are chosen from the list of commands in the Edit Sequence dialog 
box. If you want to add a command that doesn’t exist in the list in the Edit Sequence dialog box, 
you can create custom sequences from commands you add with JavaScript.
JavaScript offers you an infinite number of possibilities for automating commands and sequences 
applied to a group of PDF documents. As an example, suppose you want to add a Stamp comment 
to an assorted collection of PDFs designed to be documents in draft form. After the files have been 
stamped with a Draft icon from the Stamp comment, you disperse the documents, collect feedback, 
and use another batch sequence to delete all comments from the documents. The sequence for 
deleting comments is a preset installed with Acrobat. Adding Stamp comments, however, is some-
thing you need to do with a JavaScript. Use the steps that follow to add a JavaScript to a batch 
sequence, and in particular, to add a Stamp comment to a collection of PDF files.
STEPS: Creating a JavaScript batch sequence
 
1. Create a new batch sequence. Choose Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Batch 
Processing. In the Batch Sequences dialog box, select New Sequence. When the Name 
Sequence dialog box opens, type a name for the sequence. In this example I use Add 
Stamp. Click OK.
 
2. Select Execute JavaScript and add it to the list of sequences to be executed. In the 
Edit Batch Sequence dialog box, click Select Commands to open the Edit Sequence dialog 
box. In the Edit Sequence dialog box, select Execute JavaScript from the list on the left 
and click the Add button to move the command to the right window.
 
3. Add the JavaScript code to execute the action. Select the command in the right pane 
and click the Edit button (or double-click on the command). The JavaScript Editor dialog 
box opens. In the JavaScript Editor, type the following code. (The same code is shown as 
it should appear in the JavaScript Editor in Figure 18.17.)

JavaScript Debugger (Ctrl/Cmd+J) and type the following code in the Debugger window:
this.getAnnots()[0].rect;
With the cursor placed on the line of code, press the Num Pad Enter key. The Debugger window 
reports the x,y coordinates at the four corners of the rectangle.

For more information on creating stamps and using pop-up note windows, see 
Chapter 20.
The preceding steps create a Stamp comment (from the Stamp comment you last used in Acrobat) 
(Line 2) at the coordinates (Line 6) — note that the page size where the stamps are added is a 
standard US Letter 8.5 × 11 inches in portrait view. The note pop-up window is closed by default 
(Line 7), and the content of the note pop-up is First Review (Line 9). You can change the position 
of the note by editing the coordinates in Line 6, change the contents in Line 9, or change the stamp 
type in Line 4. The code can be easily modified or you can copy and paste the code in the 
JavaScript Editor if you want to create other similar sequences.

Cropping Pages
Another method for reducing file sizes is using the Crop tool in Acrobat to trim page sizes when 
you need to have data outside crop boxes eliminated from PDF pages. You might have a spread 
with facing pages and want only the left or right page remain in a file or you might capture a 
Web page and want to retain only a small portion of the captured page in a final document.

In previous versions of Acrobat, cropping pages eliminated areas outside a crop box when viewing 
a cropped page in an Acrobat viewer, but the data outside the crop region remained with the file. 
You didn’t experience any reduction in file size because the data was still there and you could eas-
ily re-crop the pages to regain the original data.
In Acrobat 9 we have methods for cropping pages in Acrobat and eliminating all data outside the 
crop area. I saved this section for last in this chapter because we need to use Examine Document as 
I covered earlier in the section “Examining Documents” and creating batch sequences as I covered 
earlier in the section “Batch Processing PDF Files.”
Using the Crop tool
To crop a page in Acrobat, open the Advanced Editing toolbar and click the Crop tool. When the 
Crop tool is selected, you can click + drag to define a crop region or double-click the cursor to open 
the Crop Pages dialog box where you can define the crop box size.
In Figure 18.19 I dragged the Crop tool around the left page in a two-page spread.
 FIGURE 18.19

Once the crop box is defined on a page, double-click the cursor inside the crop box and the Crop 
Pages dialog box opens as shown in Figure 18.20. The preview in the Crop Pages dialog box shows 
you the entire layout however the Cropped page size text below the preview shows you the new 
page size that will result when you click OK in the Crop Pages dialog box.
 FIGURE 18.20
Double-click the cursor inside the crop box and the Crop Pages dialog box opens.
Click OK in the Crop Pages dialog box and you return to the Document pane viewing the page 
cropped as you defined the crop region. However, at this point, you haven’t permanently removed 
data from your document.
You can eliminate some data outside the crop area by using the Examine Document command. 
When you choose Document ➪ Examine Document and remove the selected items in the Examine 
Document panel, you remove content outside the crop area but the original page size does not 
change. In Figure 18.21, I chose Document ➪ Examine Document and the Examine Document 
panel reported information that could be removed from my file.
After clicking Remove in the Examine Document panel, you might think all data are removed out-
side the crop area. To see what data were removed outside the crop area, click the Crop tool in the 
Advanced Editing toolbar and double-click on the page. Again the Crop Pages dialog box opens 
and you can see what still remains in the file by looking over the thumbnail preview as shown in 
Figure 18.22.

Creating a Preflight profile
Using the Preflight tool, you can permanently delete all data outside a crop region and trim the 
page to the crop area. If you plan to regularly crop pages, you’ll want to create a custom profile 
that you can easily access to crop pages routinely.
In Acrobat terms, the crop area is known as the Crop Box and the page size is known as the Media 
Box. Our task at hand is to reduce the size of the Media Box (the page size) to the Crop Box (the 
area defined when using the Crop tool). To reduce the Media Box to the size of the Crop Box, do 
the following:
STEPS: Creating a Preflight profile to trim a Media Box to a Crop Box
 
1. Open the Preflight window. Choose Advanced ➪ Preflight and the Preflight window 
opens.
 
2. Create a new Preflight profile. Click the Options pull-down menu and choose Create 
New Preflight Profile from the menu commands. The Preflight Edit Profile dialog box 
opens.
 
3. Define the Profile attributes. When the Preflight: Edit Profile dialog box opens, you 
need to make several options choices (see Figure 18.23):
 
a. Type a name for the profile.
 
b. Choose Fixups from the hierarchical list in your new profile.
 
c. Choose Remove page objects which are completely outside of trim area. Scroll the 
list until you find this item and select it.
 
d. Add the fixup item to your profile. With the fixup item selected in the right pane, 
click the left arrow to add the fixup to your profile.
 
e. Be certain the fixup is added to the profile. You should see the item added to the 
middle column as shown in Figure 18.23. Leave the dialog box open to continue with 
the steps that follow.

Set the attributes for your new profile in the Preflight: Edit Profile dialog box.
 
 
4. Edit the Fixup. Double-click the fixup (item 5 in Figure 18.23) to open the Preflight: Edit 
Fixup dialog box shown in Figure 18.24. Several edits need to be made in this dialog box 
that include:
 
a. Choose Pages in the Fixup category.
 
b. Choose Set page geometry boxes in the Type of fixup list. Scroll the list and select 
this item.
 
c. Choose a Source. Open the Source pull-down menu and choose MediaBox.
 
d. Choose a Destination. Open the Destination pull-down menu and choose Relative to 
CropBox.
 
e. Click OK.

 FIGURE 18.24
Set the Edit Fixup attributes.
At this point your profile is available for use. To eliminate all data outside a crop box and to reduce 
the page size to the size of a crop box, you would open a document in Acrobat and crop a page(s). 
Use the Document ➪ Examine Document command and Remove all items listed in the Examine 
Document panel. Then choose Advanced ➪ Preflight to open the Preflight window. Click your pro-
file and click Analyze and fix as shown in Figure 18.25.
Trimming media boxes with a batch sequence
You can automate the process for cropping pages and setting the media box size to the crop box 
size by using a batch sequence. To begin with, you might use the Crop tool to crop pages in a 
number of PDF documents and save the files.

ter in the section “Batch Processing PDF Files.” In the Edit Sequence dialog box, add the Examine 
Document and Preflight items listed in the left pane to the right pane as shown in Figure 18.26.
Double-click the Preflight item in the right pane to open the Preflight: Batch Sequence Setup dialog 
box. Scroll the list to find the sequence you created to trim the media box and select it as shown in 
Figure 18.27. Click OK and save your sequence. When you run the sequence on files that have 
been cropped, the pages will be trimmed to the crop box sizes.

Summary
 File sizes can be reduced with the Reduce File Size menu command. If you’re cropping 
image files in Acrobat, save the cropped image to an image format, and then open the file 
in Acrobat to convert back to PDF.
 Examine Document offers some options for deleting content from files to help reduce file 
size.
 The PDF Optimizer (Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended only) is used to reduce file sizes and 
eliminate unnecessary data in PDF files. PDF Optimizer can often reduce file sizes more 
than when using the Reduce File Size command.
 Selecting options in the Discard Objects pane in the PDF Optimizer other than the 
default options can interfere with the PDF functionality. Care must be exercised in select-
ing options to prevent potential problems.
 The Flatten form fields option in the Discard Objects pane discards field objects while 
retaining data for optimizing forms when the fields are no longer needed.
 In some cases, saving a PDF file to disk and redistilling with Acrobat Distiller can reduce 
file sizes. Redistillation can be used with Acrobat Standard where no PDF Optimizer is 
available.
 Several new batch processing features have been added to menu commands in Acrobat 9, 
and new sequences have been added to the Edit Sequence dialog box.
 Batch sequences help you automate processing multiple PDF documents. From a stan-
dard set of sequence options you can create batch sequences for a limited number of 
actions. When custom options are needed, you can add JavaScripts for processing files 
with custom settings.
 You can eliminate data outside a crop box and reduce page sizes using the Preflight tool.

E
nabling features for Adobe Reader or adding special features for 
Reader users is a means whereby certain features not appearing in 
the default Adobe Reader program can be added to PDF documents. 
This enabling function can be handled by one of two applications. You can 
use a server product such as the Adobe LiveCycle Reader® Extensions ES 
or Adobe Acrobat 9 Standard, Pro, and Pro Extended.
In Acrobat 7, a single enabling feature was introduced that added these 
special features to permit Adobe Reader users participation in email–based 
reviews. When a PDF document was enabled for commenting and markup, 
all the comment tools appeared in Adobe Reader, they were usable, and the 
comments could be saved using Reader.
In Acrobat 8, Adobe introduced more enabling features such as those for 
saving form data and adding digital signatures. These options are not part 
of Adobe Reader. But when opening an enabled file in Reader, you can take 
advantage of the special features for saving form data and adding digital 
signatures.
In Acrobat 9, Adobe has broadened the enabling features to include the 
Acrobat Standard users (Windows only).

Setting Up the Enabling Work Environment
Enabling PDF files with Reader extensions is handled through menu commands. No special tool-
bars need to be loaded to enable PDF files. Return to the default view by opening a context menu 
and selecting Reset Toolbars.
Adobe LiveCycle Reader® Extensions ES To get a grasp on enabling PDF files and to better under-
stand what limitations you have for adding special features to PDFs, you should know a little some-
thing about Adobe’s server product used for adding special features. The Adobe LiveCycle Reader® 
Extensions ES is a server product sold to enterprises and large organizations. The cost of the prod-
uct is prohibitive for individual users and small companies not having industrial strength needs.
At first blush you might think the cost is extraordinary. But stop for a moment and think about 
an organization like the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that uses LCRE. The IRS processes mil-
lions of forms annually for income tax reporting. In an analog world where the IRS needs to print 
millions of tax forms and distribute them worldwide, the costs per form rise well above a more 
affordable solution such as the LiveCycle Reader Extensions Server.
You and I as individual users of Acrobat are not likely to purchase LCRE, but we may have an 
occasional need to work with forms that need to be enabled for Adobe Reader users. This being 
the case, Adobe recognized the gap between independent PDF authors and workers within small 
workgroups versus IT managers enabling forms for mass distribution. Hence, the enabling features 
have been enriched in Acrobat 9 Standard, Pro, and Pro Extended.
Restrictions for Enabling Features
As logic would have it, you’re no doubt thinking there must be some restriction or limitation on 
enabling PDF files in Acrobat. After all, how could Adobe hope to sell one product that starts at 
$30,000 when a user could find the same thing purchasing a copy of Acrobat?
There are indeed limitations and they are all spelled out in the End User License Agreement (EULA) 
you agree to when installing Acrobat. Just in case you are confused about language in the agreement 
after reading it, let me paraphrase the licensing agreement and amplify some of the conditions. In 
addition to what is covered in this chapter, you should carefully read the agreement and understand 
the limitations of use.
Audience
Prior to Acrobat 8 there was no opportunity for users to enable features in PDF files that permit 
Adobe Reader users the ability to fill in form data, save the data, and digitally sign documents. Adobe 
recognized a clear distinction between users who have occasional and limited needs versus enter-
prises that distribute PDF forms to many thousands of people.

639
Enabling Features for Adobe Reader
19
Small to medium businesses might have needs for people to fill out small batches of forms for 
travel expense claims, purchase orders, personal time off forms, and so on. Some of the data such 
as data compiled from expense forms might need to be exported to an Excel spreadsheet and inte-
grated into an accounting program.
You might also have an annual charity golf tournament with a few hundred participants, a small 
annual conference with fewer than 300 registrants, or a similar need to distribute forms and col-
lect data.
These kinds of examples fit within Adobe’s EULA and target audience. On the other hand, if you 
have a commercial Web site and you’re collecting PDF forms for point of sale purchases where the 
numbers of potential customers may be in the thousands, then this kind of use for your PDF-enabled 
forms is a clear violation of the licensing agreement.
Licensing restrictions
The language in the EULA suggests that you can enable PDF forms with forms saving for Adobe 
Reader users for up to 500 instances of a given document. The document usage can be one of two 
ways. You can distribute an unlimited number of enabled forms, but you can only aggregate up to 
500 forms — something like hosting a form on your Web site where you might get less than 500 
registrants for a conference. The other instance is distributing forms to 500 named individuals, and 
you can aggregate any number of those forms — something like expense accounts that people fill 
out and return monthly.
NOTE
NOTE
For an up-to-date description of the Acrobat EULA or any other Adobe product, 
visit www.adobe.com/products/eulas. On the opening Web page you’ll find 
links 
to Acrobat and other Adobe products specifying the conditions of the license agreements.
Enforcing the restrictions
Adobe uses no special coding or technology to ensure users are complying with the licensing agree-
ment. Adobe believes that the enforcement for restricting users to the limitations is vested in the 
amount of work people need to perform. For limited use, the enabling features in Acrobat 9 serve 
a need for many PDF authors. However, the kind of use an LCRE user needs to process volumes 
of forms, such as parsing data and routing data to databases, is something to be found only in the 
server products from Adobe.
There remains a clear distinction between industrial strength use and limited use, not only in the 
licensing agreement but also in practicality. The enabling features do not diminish the need for 
the Adobe LiveCycle Reader® Extensions ES. Quite the contrary: Workgroups that begin to work 
more with enabling PDFs with Reader extensions are likely to experience needs for evolving to more 
sophisticated uses that can only be satisfied using LCRE.

Part III
Enabling PDF Documents with 
Reader Extensions
In Acrobat 9 Pro, and Pro Extended you can enable PDFs with special usage rights for adding com-
ments and markups and save the comments once added in Adobe Reader. You can enable PDF 
forms using Standard, Pro, and Pro Extended, adding features for Adobe Reader users, permitting 
the Reader user to save form data and add digital signatures.
PDF files can be enabled for Comment & Markup, Digital Signatures, Digital Signature Tool 
(Acrobat 8 and higher) and Forms Fill/Save. How you go about enabling files from Acrobat is han-
dled through menu commands. You choose from one of five menu commands for adding special 
features to PDF documents for Adobe Reader users.
Enabling PDFs for Commenting 
(Acrobat 9 Pro, Acrobat 9 Pro Extended)
The first of the five menu commands you can use to enable PDF files for Adobe Reader users is 
Comments ➪ Enable for Commenting and Analysis in Adobe Reader. The first time you select this 
command an application alert dialog box opens informing you that certain editing functions nor-
mally available to Acrobat users will be restricted. If you check the Don’t show again check box as 
shown in Figure 19.1, the dialog box won’t appear when enabling future documents.
 FIGURE 19.1
The first time you enable a file for commenting in Adobe Reader an application alert dialog box opens.
Click OK in the application alert dialog box and a Save As dialog box opens. Type a new name for 
your file to avoid overwriting the original and click the Save button. The PDF is now enabled with 
Adobe Reader usage rights for commenting and markup.
When an Adobe Reader user opens the enabled PDF document, the Comment & Markup tools 
are all accessible, as shown in Figure 19.2. You can add the same kind of comments as you can 
with either Acrobat Standard or Acrobat Pro, or Pro Extended. After adding comments, the Reader 
user also has access to a File ➪ Save command. This command is not available unless a file has 
been enabled. Selecting File ➪ Save permits the Reader user the opportunity to save all comments 
added to the PDF.

information on comment and markup, see Chapter 20.
Enabling PDFs for Comment & Review
Enabling PDFs for Comment & Review provides essentially the same usage rights as when enabling 
for Commenting in Adobe Reader. You click the Comment tool in the Tasks Toolbar to open a pull-
down menu. From the menu items, select Attach for Email Review. The Send by Email for Review 
wizard opens. Enabling the document is transparent to the user. In the Preview Invitation pane, 
you are shown a default message attached to a new email indicating that Adobe Reader users can 
participate in the review, as shown in Figure 19.3.
Although no options appear for enabling the document for Adobe Reader users, the process for 
sending a PDF document in an Email Review adds special rights to the file via the Send For Email 
Review wizard.

The third of the five menu options provides you a complete set of enabling features for Adobe 
Reader users. In Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended select Advanced ➪ Extend Features in Adobe Reader, 
and the Enable Usage Rights in Adobe Reader dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 19.4. In Acrobat 
Standard, choose Advanced ➪ Extend Forms Fill-in & Save in Adobe Reader.

Click Save Now and all the features listed in the dialog box are enabled in the PDF file for Adobe 
Reader users. This option provides a complete set of enabling features, including the following:
 Save form data (for fillable PDF forms only). Adobe Reader users can add data to PDF 
forms containing form fields and save the edited file.
 Commenting and drawing mark-up tools. The same comment and markup tools are 
available to Adobe Reader users as when enabling files for Comment & Markup and 
Review & Comment. All comments can be saved.
 Sign an existing signature field. Adobe Reader users can add a digital signature to a sig-
nature field on a form and save the edits.
 Digitally sign the document on the page (supported in Adobe Reader 8 only). As the 
text implies, this feature is available only to users of Adobe Reader 8 and above. It is also 
not available for XML forms created with LiveCycle Designer. A Reader 8 and above user 
can sign a document without the appearance of a signature file and save the edits.
When you click Save Now, the file is enabled with the usage rights.

For more information on fillable form fields, see Chapters 33 and 34. For more infor-
mation on using digital signatures, see Chapter 26.
Sending files for Shared Reviews
One of the most popular and requested features from users during the Acrobat 6 and 7 life cycles 
has been a means for sharing comments other than the options Adobe made available with Browser-
Based Reviews. In local environments as well on Web servers, users wanted a way to comment on 
documents and have all the comments viewed by all participants in a review in a collaborative 
workflow.
Adobe responded to users’ needs by introducing the Send for Shared Review command in Acrobat 
8. From a menu command in the Comment task button, users could simplify the process for con-
ducting shared reviews.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
In Acrobat 9, shared reviews became much easier with the introduction of using 
Acrobat.com. Users can now use the Acrobat.com server on Adobe’s Web site to 
conduct shared reviews. Choose Send for Shared Review from the Comment task button pull-
down menu and the Send for Shared Review wizard opens. In the first pane of the wizard shown 
in Figure 19.5, you have an option for using Acrobat.com or your own server. Regardless of 
which choice you make, the file is enabled with Adobe Reader usage rights.

Distributing Forms
The fourth of the five menu commands you can use to enable PDF documents is the Distribute 
Form command found when you enter Form Editing Mode (see Figure 19.6) or from the Forms 
menu in Viewer Mode.
Click the Distribute Form button or choose Forms ➪ Distribute Form to open the Distribute Form 
wizard shown in Figure 19.7. You’ll notice this wizard is very similar to the Send for Shared 
Review wizard shown earlier in Figure 19.5.

 FIGURE 19.6
The new Form Editing Mode in Acrobat 9 provides a button to Distribute a form via the Distribute Form

Your first step is to choose whether you want to email the form or save the form and email it later, 
send the form to your own local server, or send the form to Adobe.com. Regardless of the choice 
you make for where to send your form, the form is enabled with Adobe Reader usage rights and it 
is added to the Tracker History pane. You can easily find the form for later distribution by selecting 
Forms ➪ Track Forms and clicking the Forms item to expand a list, then clicking the Distributed 
item in the left pane.

What about Adobe LiveCycle Designer Forms?
Anyone working with forms created in Adobe LiveCycle Designer knows you have limited editing 
possibilities when opening the forms in Adobe Acrobat. You cannot enable a form with Reader 
Extensions directly in Adobe LiveCycle Designer per se. You can select File ➪ Distribute Form in 
Adobe LiveCycle Designer, but doing so launches Acrobat and opens the Distribute Form wizard. 
All enabling features of Designer forms are handled within Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended.
You can open any form created in Designer in Acrobat 9 Pro or Pro Extended and use the same 
menu commands used for all enabling features as you do when enabling files for Comment & 
Markup, Comment & Review, and Enable Features in Adobe Reader (save form and digital signa-
tures), and by using the Distribute Form command.
When you enable a form using the Comments ➪ Enable Commenting in Adobe Reader command, 
you don’t have an option for enabling form saves and commenting in the same file. Likewise, you 
don’t have an option to add a digital signature if a digital signature field is not contained on the 
form. When you use the Advanced menu for Extend Features in Adobe Reader or the Distribute 
Form command, both commenting and form saves and using digital signatures are enabled in the 
PDF for Reader users.

Editing Enabled PDF Files
Upon occasion you may enable a PDF document using any one of the enabling options available in 
Acrobat 9 Pro or Pro Extended and then later decide you want to edit the file. When you enable a 
PDF document and try to edit it in Acrobat, an application alert dialog box opens as shown in 
Figure 19.8.
 FIGURE 19.8
If you try to edit an enabled file in Acrobat, an alert dialog box opens informing you that you can’t edit the file.
Modifying an enabled PDF file
To edit an enabled file in Acrobat you first need to save a copy of the document. When you open 
non-enabled PDF files, the File menu lists commands for Save and Save As. When you open an 
enabled file in Acrobat you find the commands Save, Save As, and Save a Copy. The addition of 
the Save a Copy command is unique to enabled PDF files and only this command will remove the 
restrictions applied when the PDF was enabled. The usage rights are removed when you save a 
copy, so after editing you need to re-enable the form.
Select File ➪ Save a Copy and the Save a Copy dialog box opens as you see in Figure 19.9. Click 
the Save a Copy button and a second Save a Copy dialog box opens where you can name the copy 
and select a folder where you want to save it. Once you save a copy, your copy file is not open in 
the Acrobat Document pane. It’s merely saved to disk. Your original file remains open and it’s not 
editable. Close the open file, then select File ➪ Open or click the Open tool in the Toolbar Well. 
When the Open dialog box appears, select the copy file and open it in Acrobat. You can edit this 
file and enable it after you complete your editing tasks.

Part III
You’ll find that most of the kinds of editing you typically perform on a PDF document aren’t avail-
able with enabled documents. Items such as changing any of the Document Properties (Description, 
Security, Initial View, Custom and Advanced), adding headers and footers, changing backgrounds, 
adding comments, editing form fields, changing JavaScripts, and so on are all unavailable to you 
when working on an enabled PDF document. To edit any of these items, select File ➪ Save a Copy 
and open the copy file.

Working with enabled files and PDF Portfolios
When you create PDF Portfolios, you may want to enable a PDF document with Adobe Reader 
usage rights or edit an enabled PDF document after you create the package. The last of the five 
methods for enabling PDF documents is handled directly in a PDF Portfolio.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
PDF Portfolios are a new feature in Acrobat 9 and take the place of the PDF Package 
that was introduced in Acrobat 8. In Acrobat 8 you worked within the Acrobat User 
Interface (UI) to edit and manage files within a PDF Package. In Acrobat 9, the UI changes and you 
lose access to most of Acrobat’s tools and menus. Since you don’t have access to the Comment or 
Advanced menus where you choose commands to enable a PDF document while working in the 
Home view, you need to change the portfolio view for a given file to Preview mode.
While in Preview mode, all the Comments and Advanced menu commands are available. Choose 
Advanced ➪ Enable Features in Adobe Reader as shown in Figure 19.10. The Enable Usage Rights 
in Adobe Reader dialog box shown earlier in Figure 19.4 opens. Click OK and the file is enabled 
with Reader usage rights.
If you need to edit a file in a PDF Portfolio, you have to select the file you want to edit and open a 
context menu and choose Open File. This command opens a PDF file in a new window where you 
have access to all the Acrobat tools and menu commands. Make your edits on the file and choose 
File ➪ Save. When you close the new window, you return to the PDF Portfolio and the file is 
dynamically updated.

Summary
 Adobe LiveCycle Reader® Extensions ES (LCRE) is a server product used for enterprise-
enabling features for Adobe Reader users.
 The End User License Agreement (EULA) specifies the limitations you have for enabling 
PDFs with Reader extensions. When enabling forms for form saves for Reader users from

P
art IV deals with PDF interactivity, whether it be collabo-
ration with others on sharing information or adding 
interactive features to PDF documents. In Chapter 20 
we start with comment and markup where I cover using all the 
commenting features you have available in all Acrobat viewers. 
In Chapter 21, we move on to working in review sessions where 
you are introduced to the new Acrobat 9 features for sharing 
files on Acrobat.com and personal servers.
In Chapter 22 you find the many ways to make your PDF docu-
ments more interactive through adding bookmarks, links, and 
buttons. In Chapter 24 you find information on creating and 
working with Adobe PDF layers. This part finishes up with mak-
ing PDF documents accessible for people using screen readers.

A
dobe Acrobat is the perfect tool for workgroup collaboration. With 
sophisticated tool sets and a number of menu options, Acrobat 
provides you the ability to comment and mark up PDF documents 
and share your annotations with users dynamically on Web sites, through 
Acrobat.com, or through file exchanges on network servers or via email. For 
example, you can mark up documents, send your comments to a group of 
colleagues, ask for return comments, and track the review history. Where 
PDF documents may be too large to efficiently exchange files in emails, you 
can export comments to smaller data files or summarize them and create 
new PDF documents from comment summaries that can be sent to members 
of your workgroup. You can compare documents for changes, for comment 
status, and for errors and omissions, and, as with Acrobat 7 and 8 Pro, you 
can add usage rights in Acrobat 9 Pro to documents so Adobe Reader users 
can participate in reviews.
The review and comment tools and methods in Acrobat are extraordinary 
in number. Because Acrobat provides these great tools doesn’t necessarily 
mean you’ll use all of them in your daily work activities. The best way to 
decide what tools work best for you and your colleagues is to review this 
chapter thoroughly and pick and choose the tools you favor and the features 
in review and markup that work best in your environment. In this chapter, 
you learn how to use all the comment tools and compare documents for 
reviewing purposes.

Part IV
Setting Up the Review and 
Comment Environment
You may be a user who adds comments infrequently with a few comment tools located in the 
Comment & Markup toolbar. However, to decide what tools work best in your workflow, you 
might want to add all the tools for review and markup to the Toolbar Well and look over all the 
tools available in your viewer.
To set up the review and comment work environment, open a context menu on the Toolbar Well 
and select Reset Toolbars to return to the default toolbar view. Return to the context menu and 
select More Tools to open the More Tools window (or select Tools ➪ Customize Toolbars). In the 
More Tools window, click the Advanced Editing toolbar and be sure to check the Select Object 
tool and the TouchUp tools. Check the Comment & Markup toolbar and add check marks to all 
the tools in this toolbar. Scroll down and pick and choose the Select & Zoom toolbar tools you 
want to use. Be certain to add the Snapshot tool.
Return to the context menu and select the Properties Bar. Again return to the context menu opened 
from the Toolbar Well and select Dock All Toolbars. After docking toolbars, your Toolbar Well 
should look similar to the one shown in Figure 20.1.
 FIGURE 20.1
A view of toolbars set up for comment and review
Notice that the tools are grouped together in logical collections. In a real-world scenario, you might 
only use tools from a single group and not need to load all the tools in the Toolbar Well. If you 
work on a small monitor, you can see how expanding all the tools and the Comments panel can 
eat up a lot of screen real estate very quickly. If the view of your pages in the Document pane is too 
small to comfortably annotate files, close the less frequently used tools to open up more space in 
the Document pane.

Additional comment tools include the Measuring tools. These tools are often used 
with engineering and CAD drawings. For more information on using measuring 
tools consult the Acrobat Help document.

Setting Commenting Preferences
Acrobat provides an elaborate set of preference options that enable you to control comment views 
and behavior. As you draw comments on PDF pages you may see pop-up windows, connector 
lines across a page, changes in page views, and a host of other strange behaviors that might confuse 
you. Before you begin a commenting session, you should familiarize yourself with the commenting 
preferences and plan to return to the preference settings several times to completely understand 
how you control comment behavior in Acrobat.
Open the preference settings by pressing Ctrl/Ô+K or choosing Edit ➪ Preferences (Windows) or 
Acrobat ➪ Preferences (Macintosh). In the left pane, select Commenting. In the right pane, you’ll 
see a long list of preference settings, as shown in Figure 20.2. Take a moment to review these set-
tings before you begin a commenting session.
 FIGURE 20.2
Open the Commenting Preferences by pressing Ctrl/Ô+K or choosing Edit ➪ Preferences. When the 
Preferences dialog box opens, select Commenting in the left pane.
 Font (Windows only). The comment tools are used to mark up text and create icons, 
symbols, and graphic objects on pages. Most of the comment tools have associated pop-
up notes where you type remarks in a note window. By default, the font used for the note 
text is Tahoma. To change the font, select another font from the pull-down menu. All 
fonts loaded in your system are available from the menu choices. The fonts you use are

not embedded in the file. If you exchange PDFs containing comment notes with other 
users, the fonts default to another user’s preference settings.
 
Note that changing fonts and arbitrary font sizes is not available on the Mac. On the Mac 
the default Tahoma font is used and sizes are limited to Small, Medium, and Large.
 Font Size. Font point sizes range from 4 points to 144 points. You can type a number 
between these values in the field box or select one from the preset point sizes from the 
pull-down menu. Changing font size applies to note pop-up windows you see on your 
computer. If you change font size and share the file with other users, fonts appear in sizes 
set by individual user preferences.
 Pop-up Opacity. A pop-up note background color is white. At 100 percent opacity the 
note is opaque and hides underlying page data. You can change the opacity of pop-up 
notes for a transparent view so the background data can be seen when a pop-up note 
window is open. You adjust the level of transparency by typing a value in the field box or 
selecting one from the preset choices in the pull-down menu. The default is 85 percent.
 Enable text indicators and tooltips. Turns on or off tooltips when the Hand tool 
approaches a comment icon. The tooltip reports text contained in a comment note when 
the note is collapsed.
 Print notes and pop-ups. Enabling this check box prints the pop-up note contents for 
all pop-up note windows regardless of whether they are opened or collapsed.
 Show lines connecting comment markups to their pop-ups on mouse rollover. When 
you place the cursor over a comment markup, a line appears between the comment mark 
and the pop-up note, as shown in Figure 20.3.
 Ensure that pop-ups are visible as the document is scrolled. If a comment note extends 
beyond one page in a continuous page view, the note is visible when scrolling pages.
 FIGURE 20.3
When the preference setting is enabled, connector lines are displayed on a mouseover 
between the comment and the associated note window.

 Automatically open comment pop-ups for comments other than notes. As you create 
comments with drawing tools, the Text Box tool, or Pencil tool, the pop-up note windows 
are collapsed by default. If you want a pop-up note window opened and ready to accept 
type when creating comments, check the box.
 Hide comment pop-ups when Comments List is opened. The Comments List is con-
tained in the Comments panel. When you open the Comments panel, the list shows 
expanded comment notes with the content displayed in the pane. To hide the pop-ups in 
the Document pane when the Comments panel is opened, enable the check box. If you 
set this item as a default, you can expand comments in the Comments panel by clicking 
icons to see the content of the pop-ups.
 Automatically open pop-ups on mouse rollover. Pop-up note windows can be opened 
or closed. Double-clicking a collapsed pop-up note window opens the window. If you 
want to have a pop-up note window open automatically as the cursor is placed over a 
comment icon, select this check box.
 Always use Login Name for Author name. Another set of preferences appears when 
you click on Identity in the left pane. The Login Name specified in the Identity prefer-
ences is used for the author name on all comments when this check box is enabled. If 
you are a single user on a workstation, setting the Identity preferences and enabling this 
check box saves you time creating comments when you want to add your name as the 
author name.
 Create new pop-ups aligned to the edge of the document. By default, the top-left 
corner of a pop-up note window is aligned to the top left corner of the comment icon. 
If you enable this check box, no matter where you create the note icon, the pop-up notes 
are aligned to the right edge of the document.
 Copy encircled text into Drawing comment pop-ups. When proofreading a document 
and using the Markup tools you mark text with the Rectangle tool, Circle tool, or Cloud 
tool. When this preference option is checked, the text you surround with one of these 
tools is placed in a comment note.
 Copy selected text into Highlight, Cross-Out, and Underline comment pop-ups. This 
enables the text selected with the Highlight Text, Cross Out Text, and Underline Text tools 
to automatically appear in the pop-up note window.
As you can see, there are many different preference settings. How you want to view comments and 
the methods used for review and comment is influenced by the options you set in the Commenting 
preferences. Take some time to play with these settings as you use the tools discussed in this chapter.
Looking at the Comment & Markup Toolbar
Users of Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows), Acrobat Pro, Acrobat Standard (Windows), and Adobe 
Reader (when a file is enabled with usage rights) can access the Comment & Markup tools.

Part IV
Users of earlier versions of Acrobat will notice that all Comment & Markup tools are added to a 
single toolbar in Acrobat 8 and 9. In earlier versions of Acrobat, you had the Comment & Markup 
toolbar and the Drawing Markups toolbar. In Acrobat 8 and 9, all commenting tools with the 
exception of the Measuring tools are contained in a single toolbar.
The commenting and markup tools arranged in a single toolbar are shown in Figure 20.4.

The Comment & Markup toolbar essentially contains two tool subsets. The Commenting tools 
begin with the Sticky Note tool on the far left of the toolbar and move to the right to the Record 
Audio Comment tool. The Markup tools begin with the Callout tool in the middle of the toolbar 
and extend to the far right to the Pencil Eraser tool. While the Commenting tools are generally 
used for text documents, the Markup tools are used more with drawings and diagrams. All tools 
are accessible in any kind of PDF document you want to mark up with comments, and you can use 
any tool to mark up text and drawings.
Using the Comment & Markup Tools
The Comment & Markup tools are intended for use by anyone reviewing and marking up docu-
ments. Much like you might use a highlighter on paper documents, the commenting tools enable 
you to electronically comment and mark up PDF documents. A variety of tools with different icon 
symbols offer you an extensive library of tools that can help you facilitate a review process.

659
Review and Markup

Most comment tools have a symbol or icon that appears where the comment is created. They also 
have a note pop-up window where you add text to clarify a meaning associated with the mark you 
add to a document. These pop-up note windows have identical attributes. How you manage note 
pop-ups and change the properties works the same regardless of the comment mark you create, 
with the exception of the Callout and Text Box tools. I explain how to use the Sticky Note tool in 
this section. All the features described for the Sticky Note tool are the same as when handling note 
pop-up windows for all the comment tools that accommodate note pop-ups.
Using the Sticky Note tool
 
 The Sticky Note tool is the most common commenting tool used in Acrobat and the oldest of the 
commenting tools dating back to Acrobat 2. To create a comment note, select the Sticky Note tool 
in the Comment & Markup toolbar and drag open a note window. When you release the mouse 
button, the note pop-up aligns to the top left corner of the note icon.
You can also select the Sticky Note tool and click the mouse button or open a context menu and 
select Add Sticky Note. Using either of these options adds a note comment on the right side of the 
document page away from the note icon if the Create new pop-ups aligned to the edge of the doc-
ument preference option is checked in the Commenting preferences. If you disable the preference 
option, using either of these methods positions the note pop-up close to the right side of the note 
icon.
TIP
TIP
You can also add notes to a page via menu commands. To add a note to a page, 
choose Comments ➪ Add Sticky Note. A comment note is added to the center of 
the page in view. For example, if the document is viewed in a Fit Page view, the note appears 
in the center of the page. If the document view is zoomed in to show only the top third of the 
page, the comment note appears in the center of the top third in view.
When you can click without dragging and release the mouse button, a pop-up note window is cre-
ated at a fixed size according to your monitor resolution. The higher you set your monitor resolu-
tion the smaller the pop-up note window appears. On an 800 × 600 display, the window size 
defaults to 360 × 266 pixels. In Figure 20.5, I drew a comment note with the Sticky Note tool in 
the center of the page. On the left side of the page, I clicked the Sticky Note tool. Notice the center 
note is aligned with the note icon, whereas the icon on the left is linked to the note pop-up on the 
far right side of the page. Note also that because my cursor is not placed over either note, no con-
nector lines appear between the Sticky Note icon and the pop-up note window.
To add text to the pop-up note, begin typing. Acrobat places an I-beam cursor inside the pop-up 
note window immediately after creating the note. For font selection and font sizing, you need to 
address the Commenting preference settings discussed earlier in this chapter.

 FIGURE 20.5
When clicking and dragging the Sticky Note tool, the pop-up note aligns to the top left corner of the note 
icon. When clicking with the Sticky Note tool, a pop-up window is created at a fixed size away from 
the icon.
Managing notes
The color of a note pop-up and the note icon is yellow by default. At the top of the note pop-up 
the title bar is colored yellow and the area where you add the contents is white. The title bar con-
tains information supplied by Acrobat that includes the subject of the note, the author, and the 
date and time the note is created. You can move a note pop-up independently of the note icon by 
clicking and dragging the title bar.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
The Subject of a note by default is titled Sticky Note. The default Author name is 
derived from either your computer logon name or your Identity depending on how 
your preferences are established. For information on how to change the Subject and Author in 
the title bar, see “Sticky Note tool properties” later in this chapter.
You delete note pop-up windows and Sticky Note icons either by selecting the note icon and pressing 
the Delete/Backspace or Del key on your keyboard, or through a context menu selection. If you use a 
keystroke to delete a note, you must be certain to select the icon; then press the Delete/Backspace or 
Del key. Selecting the title bar in a note pop-up and using the same keys won’t delete the note.
To resize a note pop-up window, grab the lower-right corner of the window and drag in or out to 
resize smaller or larger, respectively. Note pop-ups containing more text that can be viewed in the 
current window size use scroll bars, so you can scroll the window much like you would when 
viewing pages in the Document pane. Only vertical scroll bars are shown in the pop-up windows. 
As you type text in the window, text wraps to the horizontal width, thereby eliminating a need for 
horizontal scroll bars. As you size a note pop-up window horizontally, the text rewraps to conform 
to the horizontal width.

You open context menus from either the note icon or the note pop-up window. When opening a 
context menu from the note pop-up window, you have two choices: open the context menu from 
the title bar or open the context menu from inside the note window (below the title bar). 
Depending on where you open the context menu, the menu selections are different. Opening a 
context menu from the title bar or from the note icon shows identical menu options. You can also 
use the Options menu to open the same menu as when opening a context menu inside the note 
window. Click the right-pointing arrow adjacent to Options and the menu opens.
In Figure 20.6, I opened on the Options pull-down menu on a pop-up note window. The menu 
options are the same as if I had opened the context menu from the note icon. In Figure 20.7, I 
opened the context menu from inside the note pop-up window. Depending on edits you make in 
the note window and whether you have text selected, menu options change. In Figure 20.7, text 
was selected in the note window that adds the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands to the context 
menu. In both menus, you can select Delete to remove the note pop-up menu and the note icon.
 FIGURE 20.6
This context menu is opened from the note pop-up window title bar. From the menu options, select Delete 
to remove the note icon and the note pop-up menu.
Note Nomenclature
T
he tool you use to create notes is the Sticky Note tool. In earlier versions of Acrobat, this tool was 
called the Note tool. When referring to the tool throughout this chapter, I refer to it by its proper 
name in Acrobat 8 and 9 (Sticky Note tool). When you add comments from most of the other com-
menting tools, the tools have an associated note pop-up window. Throughout this chapter, I refer to 
this window as the pop-up note window or simply refer to it as a note or note window.
The official name for the toolbar where you select tools for comments and markups is called the 
Comment & Markup toolbar. For simplicity and ease of reading, I often refer to the tools in this tool-
bar as the commenting tools. When you see a reference to the commenting tools, realize that I’m 
talking about both comment and markup tools.

If you accidentally delete a note or several notes, you can select Edit ➪ Undo to 
bring back the note and Sticky Note icon. Successively select the Undo command 
and you can bring back several Sticky Note icons and note windows.
The context menus are similar, and most commands existing in the smaller menu are the same as 
those found in the larger menu. If two notes are selected, additional menu commands appear in a 
context menu.
 FIGURE 20.7
When you open a context menu from the note pop-up window below the title bar, menu options change. 
If you select text in the note window, additional commands are added to the context menu.
Click the Select Object tool in the Advanced Editing toolbar and open a context menu on one of 
the note icons. You see different menu commands when two or more comment icons are selected 
as shown in Figure 20.8. The options you have in the context menu are the same as those you find 
when opening a context menu on two or more form fields.

 FIGURE 20.8
Drag the Select Object tool through comment icons to select two or more. Open a context menu and new 
menu commands appear for organizing comments.
In Figure 20.7, you see a long list of menu commands. Let’s take a look at these commands; the 
same commands found in the context menu shown in Figure 20.6 operate the same way.
 Cut Text/Copy Text. These items work as you might assume from using any text editor 
or word processor. The commands relate to typing text in the note pop-up window. You 
can also highlight text and use key modifiers (Ctrl/Ô+C for Copy; Ctrl/Ô+X for Cut; 
Ctrl/Ô+V for Paste).
 Delete Text. Select text and choose Delete Text. The selected text is deleted.
 Check Spelling. When you select Check Spelling in the note pop-up menu, the Check 
Spelling dialog box opens. When the dialog box opens, click the Start button and Acrobat 
checks the spelling for all the text typed in the note pop-up. When Acrobat finds a mis-
spelled word, it is highlighted and a list of suggestions that closely match the spelling is 
shown in the lower window. Select a word with the correct spelling and click the Change 
button.
 Remove “...” from Dictionary. This menu item is active only when you have a word 
selected in the note pop-up window and that note is contained in your custom dictionary. 
It’s a nifty little feature in Acrobat. Because Acrobat automatically spell-checks text you 
type in the comment note pop-up window by matching your words to those found in its 
dictionary, words not matched are underlined in red with a wavy line similar to those used 
in programs such as Microsoft Word. If you want Acrobat to alert you whenever you type 
a specific word, remove that word from the dictionary. Then Acrobat displays the word 
with a red underline each time you use it.
 
When would you use this feature? Assume for a moment that you want to use a generic 
reference to users as opposed to a masculine or feminine reference. Highlight the word he 
or she and open a context menu from the note pop-up window. Select Remove “he” from 
Dictionary. Each time you type the word he, Acrobat underlines the word because it can’t 
find a match in the dictionary. When you review your notes, you might substitute s/he for 
the word he.

 Look Up “...”. The default menu command is Look Up Definition. When a word is 
selected, the menu command changes to Look Up selected word. For example, if you select 
a word like reply, the menu command changes to Look Up “reply.” Select the menu com-
mand, which launches your Web browser, opening to the Dictionary.com Web site where 
the word is searched and a definition is displayed on the Web page.
CROSS-REF

For more information on looking up a definition and the Dictionary.com Web site, 
see Chapter 13.
 Text Style. From a submenu, select from Bold, Italic, Underline, Superscript, Subscript, 
or Clear Formatting). Select any one of the formatting options to apply to selected text. 
You can combine format changes by selecting text and a format option, and then return 
to the context menu and select another option, and so on.
 Mark with Checkmark. Whereas the Set Status items are communicated to others, a 
check mark you add to a comment is for your own purposes. You can mark a comment 
as checked to denote any comments that need attention, or that are completed and require 
no further annotation. Check marks are visible in the Comments panel and can be toggled 
on or off in the pane as well as the context menu. Check marks can be added to comments 
with or without your participation in a review session. You can choose to have your com-
ments sorted by those with check marks and those comments without check marks.
 Minimize Pop-Up Note. Selecting this command closes the note window. Click back on 
the Sticky Note icon and the note window opens again. The same close action is also avail-
able by clicking the minimize icon in the top right corner of the note pop-up window.
 Reset Pop-Up Note Location. If you move a note pop-up window, selecting this menu 
command returns the note pop up to the default position.
 Delete. Deletes the comment pop-up note and the note icon.
 Reply. When participating in a review, you select the Reply command to reply to com-
ments made from other users. A new window opens in which you type a reply message. 
From the pop-up bar you can review a thread and click the Reply button to send your 
comments to others via email, using Acrobat.com, to a network folder, or to a Web-
hosted server.

 Show Comments List. Selecting this item opens the Comments panel. Any comments 
in the open document are expanded in a list view in the Comments panel. When the 
Comments panel is open, this option toggles to Hide Comments List.
 Make Current Properties Default. Any attributes you changed in the Properties dialog 
box (see Properties below) such as changing the Author name or Subject can be set to new 
defaults. After making settings choices, select this menu item and all subsequent notes 
you add will use the same new defaults.

Sticky Note tool properties
Each comment created from any tool supporting a pop-up note has properties that you can change 
in a properties dialog box. Properties changes are generally applied to note pop-up windows and 
icon shapes for a particular tool. In addition, a variety of properties are specific to different tools 
that offer you many options for viewing and displaying comments and tracking the history of the 
comments made on a document.
With respect to note pop-ups and those properties assigned to the Sticky Note tool, you have 
choices for changing the default color, opacity, author name, and a few other options. Keep in 
mind that not all property changes are contained in the properties dialog box. Attributes such as 
font selection and point sizes are globally applied to note pop-ups in the Comment preferences.
Setting Up the Author Name for Comment Notes
I
f you add comment markups where associated note pop-ups are available, you may find the com-
ment note author name to be the same as your computer log-on name. If you open a comment 
note Properties dialog box and change the name, and then open a context menu on the note icon 
and choose Make Current Properties Default, the author name doesn’t honor the new default. It can 
be annoying to keep opening comment properties and changing the name on each individual com-
ment note.
There is a reason for Acrobat not adhering to your wishes and it lies with the Commenting Preferences 
settings. If you want to change your author name from your computer log-on name, open the 
Preferences dialog box (Ctrl/Ô+K). Click Commenting in the left pane, and in the right pane where you 
find Making Comments, you find that a setting that enables you to use the author name. By default, 
Always use Log-on Name for Author name is checked. This check mark overrides the defaults you 
try to change using the comment note properties.
Remove the check mark and the next time you change the author name and set new defaults, all 
your comment author names are changed to your liking.

For information about Commenting preferences, see “Setting Commenting 
Preferences” at the beginning of this chapter.
Additionally, you have many options available to you in the Properties Bar. If you want certain attri-
butes to be changed for a given comment type, first look at the Properties Bar after selecting a com-
ment tool to see if a property you want to change exists in the toolbar.
In the Sticky Note tool you find attributes for changing pop-up note color, text color, icon shapes, 
and a variety of font styles. It is easier to change these attributes using the Properties Bar rather than 
the Properties dialog box. For other properties changes, such as comment author, subject, opacity 
settings, and editing the review history, you need to use the Properties dialog box.
You open the properties dialog box from a context menu. Be certain to place the cursor on a pop-
up note title bar or the note icon before opening a context menu. Select Properties from the menu 
choices and the Sticky Note Properties dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 20.9.
NOTE
NOTE
When you create a comment with any of the Comment tools, the Hand tool is 
automatically selected upon releasing the mouse button. You can select a comment 
mark/icon or pop-up note with the Hand tool or the Select Object tool. Use either tool to open 
a context menu where the menu options enable you to select Properties. However, other menu 
items vary between the two context menus. For information regarding menu options from con-
text menus opened with the Select Object tool, see the discussion on Drawing Markup tools 
later in this chapter.

 Appearance. Options in the Appearance tab relate to the note icon appearances and the 
pop-up note window appearance.
 Icon. From the scrollable list, select an item that changes the Note icon appearance. 
Selections you make in this list are dynamic and change the appearance of the icon in 
the Document pane as you click on a name in the list. If you move the Note Properties 
dialog box out of the view of the note icon, you can see the appearance changes as you 
make selections in the list. Fifteen different icons are available to choose from, as shown 
in Figure 20.10. The same options are also available in the Properties Bar. Click the 
Icon button in the Properties Bar and a pull-down menu opens where the same 
choices are listed.

You select icon shapes from the Icon list in the Appearance tab in the Note Properties 
dialog box or in the Icon pull-down menu in the Properties Bar. You can choose from 
15 different shapes.
 Color. Click the color swatch to open the pop-up color palette shown in Figure 20.11. 
You select preset colors from the swatches in the palette. You add custom colors by 
selecting the Other Color item in the palette, which opens the system color palette. 
In the system color palette, make color choices and the new custom color is applied 
to the note.

Changing color in the Appearance properties affects both the color of the note icon 
and the pop-up note title bar. If you mark up and review documents in workgroups, 
different colors assigned to different participants can help you ascertain at a glance 
which participant made a given comment.
 
For a quick change in note colors, use the Properties Bar where you see the same color 
attributes found in the Properties dialog box in the Properties Bar Color pull-down 
menu.
 Opacity. Global opacity settings are applied in the Commenting Preferences dialog 
box. You can override the default opacity setting in the Appearance properties for any 
given note pop-up window.
 
Additionally, opacity adjustments can be made in the Properties Bar by choosing fixed 
opacity percentages from the Opacity pull-down menu. One distinction between adjust-
ing opacity in the Properties dialog box and making adjustments in the Properties Bar 
is that the Properties dialog box enables you to choose different opacities at 1% incre-
ments. The Properties Bar is limited to fixed opacity settings in 20% increments.
 Locked. Select the Locked check box to lock a note. When notes are locked, the posi-
tion of the note icon is fixed to the Document pane and cannot be moved when you 
leave the Note Properties dialog box. All other options in the Note Properties dialog 
box are grayed out, preventing you from making any further attribute changes. If you 
lock a note, you can move the pop-up window and resize it. The note contents, how-
ever, are locked and changes can’t be made to the text in the pop-up note window. If 
you want to make changes to the properties or the pop-up note contents, return to the 
Note Properties dialog box and uncheck the Locked check box.
 General. Click the General tab to make changes for items appearing in the note pop-up 
title bar. Two editable fields are available, as shown in Figure 20.12. The changes you 
make in the Author and Subject fields are dynamic and are reflected in the Document 
pane when you edit a field and tab to the next field. You can see the changes you make 
here before leaving the Note Properties dialog box.
 Author. The Author name is supplied by default according to how you set your 
Commenting preferences. If you use the Identity preferences, the Author name 
is supplied from the information added in the Identity preferences (see “Setting 
Commenting Preferences” earlier in this chapter). If you don’t use Identity for the 
Author title, the name is derived from your computer log-on name. You might see 
names like Owner, Administrator, or a specific name you used in setting up your 
operating system.
 
If you want to change the Author name and override the preferences, select the General 
tab and edit the Author name. The name edited in the General preferences is applied 
to the selected note. All other notes are left undisturbed. Note that you also need to 
change Identity preferences if you want to make a new default for the author name. 
(See the sidebar “Setting Up the Author Name for Comment Notes” earlier in this 
chapter.)

 FIGURE 20.12
Make changes to the Author name and the pop-up note Subject in the General 
preferences.
 Subject. By default, the Subject of a note for the Sticky Note comment is titled Sticky 
Note, which appears in the top left corner of the pop-up note title bar. When you use 
other comment tools, the subject defines the tool used. For example, when using the 
Highlight tool, you’ll see Highlight as the subject, using an Approved stamp comment 
places Approved in the Subject field, and so on.
 
You can change the subject in the General properties by typing text in the Subject 
line. You can add long text descriptions for the Subject; however, the text remains on 
a single line in the pop-up note properties dialog box. (The total characters you can 
type for the Subject field is 255.) Text won’t scroll to a second line. The amount of 
text shown for the Subject field relates to the horizontal width of the note window. 
As you expand the width, more text is visible in the title bar if you add a long Subject 
name. As you size down the width, text is clipped to accommodate the note size.
 
Text added to both the Author and Subject text boxes is searchable using Acrobat 
Search when you check the box in the Search panel for Include Comments.

The Properties dialog boxes for all Comment tools are not dynamic in Acrobat 9. 
You need to exit the Properties dialog box before making any other edits in your 
document or accessing any tool or menu command.
Setting default properties
If you use the Make Current Properties Default menu command from a context menu opened on a 
comment tool or comment pop-up note, the new default is applied only in your current Acrobat 
session. Quit Acrobat and all the defaults are lost.
You can globally change defaults for comment and markup tools and retain the new defaults in sub-
sequent Acrobat sessions. To set these defaults, open a context menu on a tool in the Comment & 
Markup toolbar and select Tool Default Properties — be certain to open the context menu on a 
tool in the Comment & Markup toolbar and not a space between the tools. A properties dialog box 
for the selected tool opens. Make any settings changes, click OK in the Properties dialog box, and 
your new defaults remain in effect until you change them again or select Reset Toolbar from the 
same context menu. (Note that the context menu opened on a tool in the Comment & Markup 
toolbar also displays commands for selecting each and every tool in the toolbar as well as opening 
the Customize Toolbars window.)
Using the Properties Bar
If you set up your work environment to view the Properties Bar while working in a review session, 
you can address several properties options from it. The attributes you can change for Sticky Notes 
have all been mentioned in the section “Sticky Note tool properties” earlier in this chapter.
One additional item you have in the Properties Bar, shown in Figure 20.13, is the More button. 
This button appears for all comment markups that support options in the Properties Bar. Click the 
More button after selecting a comment icon and the Properties dialog box opens.

Working with the Text Edits tools
 
 The Text Edits tools can be acquired from several menu locations. When you load the Comment & 
Markup toolbar, the Text Edits tools are all located in a pull-down menu adjacent to the Sticky 
Note tool in the toolbar. The Text Edits tools are the only comment tools you won’t find in the 
Comments ➪ Comment & Markup Tools submenu. The Text Edit tools can be used for any kind 
of review session; however, they were designed to be used for comments that you want to export 
to source documents that originated in programs such as Microsoft Word and Autodesk AutoCAD.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on exporting comments to Microsoft Word, see Chapter 8.
To use the tools, click the Select tool and click or select text in the Document pane. A blinking 
cursor or selected text needs to appear in a document before the Text Edits tools can be selected. 
When text is selected, you have access to all the tools in the Text Edits pull-down menu, as shown 
in Figure 20.14.
As you move to text you want to mark, drag the cursor to highlight text to be annotated. When text 
is selected, open the Text Edits pull-down menu and select the tool you want to use for your edit.
 FIGURE 20.14
Use the Select tool to click on a body of text or select text where you want to add a comment. Open the 
Text Edits pull-down menu and select the tool respective to the type of edit you want to make.
The Text Edits tools include:
 Text Edits Tool. You’ll notice the Text Edits tool looks like the Select tool. This tool is not 
used to make a comment in the document. Click the tool and a dialog box opens where 
you find help information on using all the other Text Edits tools.
NOTE
NOTE
All the tools below the Indicate Text Edit tool are grayed out unless you select the 
Select tool and click or click and drag in a text block. Selecting either option with-
out a cursor insertion on the document page or without highlighting text does not enable any 
of the Text Edit tools.
 Replace Selected Text. Use this tool to mark text for replacement. The line appears similar 
to the Cross Out Text for Deletion mark, but the caret at the end of the mark distinguishes 

672
PDF Interactivity
Part IV
this tool from the aforementioned one. A note pop-up window opens where you can add 
comments. The note contents do not include the text marked for replacement.
 Highlight Selected Text. This tool works like the Highlight tool and similar to a yellow 
highlighter you might use on paper documents. Select the Highlight tool and drag across 
a block of text. The text is highlighted and a note pop-up window enables you to add 
comments.
 Add Note to Selected Text. Select a word, a paragraph, or a body of text. When you 
release the mouse button a note pop-up window opens in which you add a comment. 
Selecting the text does not include the selected text in the pop-up note.
 Insert Text At Cursor. Select the menu command and move the cursor to the document 
page. The cursor appearance changes to an I-beam, informing you that text can be selected. 
Rather than selecting text, clicking the cursor at a specific location is the method most 
often used with this tool. The intent is to suggest to a reviewer that text needs to be 
inserted at the cursor position. When you click on a document page, a caret is marked 
on the page at the insertion location and a note pop-up window opens. Type the text to 
be inserted in the note pop-up.
 Underline Selected Text. Use this tool to underline the selected text. A note pop-up 
window opens where you can add comments.
 Cross Out Text for Deletion. Select text and the text mark appears as a strikethrough. 
The symbol is used to mark text that needs to be deleted. A note pop-up window opens 
where you can add comments.
Working with the Highlight tools
 
 The three tools appearing after the Stamp tools are the Highlight tool, the Underline tool, 
 and the Strikethrough tool. When you have comments that are to be exported to MS Word 
documents, don’t use these tools because the comments made with the tools cannot be exported to 
MS Word. Use the Text Edits tools for highlighting, strikethrough, and underlining. Where these 
three tools are helpful is when you want the text you mark to be added to a comment note. Especially 
if you have long passages of text, you’ll want to have the text added to a note where you can easily 
make some corrections/suggestions. The tools have their place, but if you don’t need text added to 
the comment note pop-ups, then always opt for using the Text Edits tools for the same types of 
markups.
Attaching files as comments
 
 The next tool in the Commenting toolbar lineup is the Attach File as Comment tool. You use this 
tool to attach files as comments. Users of Adobe Reader can open your attached files without any 
special usage rights added to the file for Adobe Reader users. The Attach File as Comment tool 
differs somewhat from another tool you have available for adding file attachments to PDFs. For 
detailed information related to using the Attach File as Comment tool and using the Attachments 
panel for adding file attachments to PDFs, see Chapter 12.

Recording audio comments
 
 Next on the Commenting toolbar you find the Record Audio Comment tool. This tool is used to 
add audio to a PDF document. You need to have a microphone properly set up on your computer, 
and you can use audio recordings in lieu of or in addition to other comments you add to a docu-
ment. For more information on using the Record Audio Comment tool and adding rich media to 
PDF files, see Chapter 23.
Using the Stamp tool
 
 The Stamp tool is part of the Commenting tools, but it differs greatly from the other tools found 
in the Comment & Markup toolbar. Rather than mark data on a PDF page and add notes to the 
marks, Stamps enable you to apply icons of your own choosing to express statements about a doc-
ument’s status or add custom icons and symbols for communicating messages. Stamps offer a wide 
range of flexibility for marking documents similar to analog stamps you might use for stamping 
approvals, drafts, confidentiality, and so on. You can use one of a number of different icons sup-
plied by Acrobat when you install the program, or you can create your own custom icons tailored 
to your workflow or company needs.

All the features related to the Stamp tool, including creating your own custom 
stamps, are treated in Adobe Reader the same as Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro, 
and Acrobat Pro Extended when PDFs contain usage rights for Adobe Reader. To learn more 
about usage rights with Adobe Reader, see Chapters 4 and 19.
Whether you use a preset stamp provided with your Acrobat installation or create a custom stamp, 
each stamp has an associated note pop-up window where you add comments. You select stamps 
from menu options in the Stamp pull-down menu where stamps are organized by categories. Add 
a stamp to a page by clicking the Stamp tool after selecting a stamp from a category; or you can 
click and drag the Stamp tool to size the icon. After creating a stamp, you access Stamp properties 
by opening a context menu and selecting Properties.
Selecting stamps
Using a stamp begins with selecting from among many different stamp images found in submenus 
from the Stamp tool pull-down menu. Click the down-pointing arrow and the first three menu 
commands list categories for stamps installed with Acrobat. If you have at least one Custom stamp 
added to your stamps library, then the custom category you added appears in addition to the three 
default categories. Notice in Figure 20.15 I added a custom category called My Custom Stamps 
that appears at the top of the Stamps pull-down menu. Selecting one of the menu items opens a 
submenu where you select specific stamps from the respective category, as shown in Figure 20.15.

Select the pull-down menu from the Stamp tool and select a Stamp category. Select a subcategory and 
slide the mouse over to the Stamp name. Release the mouse button and the selection becomes the new 
default stamp.
Adding a stamp to a page
The stamp name you select in the menu becomes the new default stamp. When you click the Stamp 
tool or click and drag open a rectangle with the Stamp tool, the default stamp is added to the doc-
ument page. Stamps are created by default with the pop-up note window collapsed unless you enable 
the Commenting preferences for “Automatically open comment pop-ups for comments other than 
notes.” To open the pop-up note window, click the mouse button on the stamp image. The pop-
up note opens and appears the same as other pop-up note windows for other Comment tools.
If you want to resize a stamp after creating it on a page, select the Hand tool and click the stamp 
icon to select it. Move the cursor to a corner handle and the cursor changes shape to a diagonal 
line with two opposing arrowheads, as shown in the lower left handle in Figure 20.16. Drag the 
handle in or out to resize the stamp.
NOTE
NOTE
Stamps are always proportionately sized when you drag any one of the corner han-
dles. You don’t need to drag handles with a modifier key to proportionately size the 
image.
Stamps can also be rotated. Click the top center handle and the cursor changes to a circle with an 
arrowhead, as shown in Figure 20.16. Drag left or right and the stamp icon rotates. You can rotate 
stamps in arbitrary 1-degree rotations or in constrained 45-degree rotations. To perform an arbitrary 
rotation, drag the center handle left or right. To constrain rotations to 45 degrees, press the Shift 
key and drag the center handle left or right. When you rotate a stamp, the note pop-up remains 
fixed in the same view as when you first open the note.

Acrobat offers you an assortment of stamps you can select from the category submenus in the Stamp 
tool pull-down menu. These stamps are created for general office uses, and you’ll find many com-
mon stamp types among the sets. The three categories of stamps and their respective types and 
icons are shown in Figure 20.17.
 FIGURE 20.17

PDF Interactivity
Part IV
You should think of these stamps as a starter set and use them for some traditional office markups 
when the need arises. The real power of stamps, however, lies in creating custom stamps where 
you can use virtually any illustration or photo image.
Changing stamp properties
You change stamp properties in the Stamp Properties dialog box. You have the same options in 
the Stamp Properties as those found in the Note Properties dialog box, with one exception. In the 
Note Properties dialog box, you make choices for the icon appearance from a list in the dialog box. 
Because stamps have appearances determined before you create the stamp, no options are available 
for changing properties for the stamp image. The color options in the Stamp Properties dialog box 
apply to comment notes and not the stamp images. Opacity settings, however, can be applied to 
the stamp image.
If you want to change the appearance of a stamp, you need to delete the stamp and create a new 
stamp after selecting the category and stamp name from the category submenu. You delete stamps 
by opening a context menu and selecting Delete, or selecting the stamp icon and pressing the 
Backspace/Delete or Del key.
Resizing Stamps
T
he stamps you find installed by Acrobat are all vector art images created in Adobe Illustrator. 
When you resize vector art images, the display quality remains the same no matter how large 
you size the stamp.
When creating custom stamps you can use a program such as Adobe Illustrator and use vector art for 
your stamp design. You can also create custom stamps from Photoshop files. These files, however, 
are raster art. If you size raster artwork above a 100% actual view size, you can see distortion in your 
stamp image.
If you plan on using photographs or other artwork created in Adobe Photoshop, be certain to antici-
pate the largest size you might need to size up a stamp icon. When you view a Photoshop image 
created at 72 ppi (pixels per inch), the largest size you can see on your monitor without distortion is 
a 100% actual size view. If you size the stamp up 200% or more, you’ll notice image degradation, 
and the image is likely to display jagged edges.
If you anticipate sizing stamps up to a 400% view, for example, create your stamps from Photoshop 
images at 288 ppi. This calculation is determined by taking 72 ppi and multiplying times 4 (72 × 4 = 
288). Hence, when you size the stamp up to 400%, the actual size view is 72 ppi. As size increases, 
resolution decreases.
If you plan your work and anticipate the size you might use for custom stamps created from 
Photoshop files, you can avoid any display problems when viewing files in Acrobat. The sizing 
issues only have to do with physically sizing a stamp image containing raster artwork. If you use 
zoom tools in Acrobat, the stamps appear at the same size no matter what zoom level you view a 
document page.

Creating custom stamps
You might create custom stamps with a company logo or personal identification so users in your 
workgroup or recipients of your files can see at a quick glance that files received are coming from 
you. You might use a custom stamp for approving documents in a review session, for asking others 
to review one of your documents, or for other business uses such as marking documents for signa-
tures, confidentiality, time stamping, or other similar tasks.
To understand how custom stamps are created, follow these steps:
STEPS: Creating a custom stamp
 
1. Create the stamp icon image. Using your favorite authoring program capable of export-
ing to one of the formats supported by creating a custom stamp, create an icon or image 
you want to use for your stamp. My tool of choice for creating custom stamps is Adobe 
Illustrator — but feel free to use the program you like to create your stamp image.
 
 File formats compatible with custom stamp creation are shown in Figure 20.18. (See the 
sidebar on file format compatibility later in this chapter.)
 FIGURE 20.18

Extended (Windows)
 
2. Select an image to use as the new custom stamp. Open Acrobat and select Create 
Custom Stamp from the Stamp tool pull-down menu. The Select Image for Custom Stamp 
dialog box opens. Click the Browse button in the dialog box and select your image file in 
the Open dialog box. Click Open and you return to the Select Image for Custom Stamp 
dialog box with a preview of your new stamp, as shown in Figure 20.19.

3. Create a new stamp category. Click OK in the Select Image for Custom Stamp dialog box 
and you arrive at the Create Custom Stamp dialog box. The Category text box appears 
with the default text: <type here to name a new category>. Select the text and type a new 
category name. (Note you can also select a category from the pull-down menu and add 
your new stamp to an existing category.) In my example, I typed MyStamps for a new 
category.
 
4. Name your stamp. Tab to the Name text box in the Create Custom Stamp dialog box 
and type a name for your stamp. I used the name Author Stamp for my stamp, as shown 
in Figure 20.20.
 
 If you want to downsample a large image file, check the Down sample stamp to reduce 
file size check box. If you want to change your design and not use the image shown in 
the preview, you can click the Select Image for Custom Stamp button and locate another 
image.
 
 When all the attributes are assigned for your new stamp, click OK.

Appending stamps to a new category
After creating a custom stamp and adding a new category, the next time you open the Create Custom 
Stamp dialog box, you have a choice for adding a new category or appending a new stamp to your 
existing category. Here’s how you append a stamp to an existing category:
STEPS: Appending stamps to an existing category
 
1. Select Manage Stamps from the Stamp tool pull-down menu. The Manage Stamps 
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 20.22.
 FIGURE 20.22
The Manage Custom Stamps dialog box shows all stamps appended to categories.
File Format Compatibility with Stamp Comments
D
epending on what type of Acrobat product you use, the file formats you can import when creat-
ing custom stamps will vary. File format compatibility is consistent with the PDF conversion 
options you have available when using the File ➪ Create PDF ➪ From File menu command. In 
Acrobat Standard, you have fewer options than with Acrobat Pro. Acrobat Pro has fewer options 
than you find with Acrobat Pro Extended.
In addition to all the 3D drawing program applications available for conversion with Acrobat Pro 
Extended (Windows), Acrobat Pro (Windows and Macintosh) offers you conversion options for rich 
media files such as movie files, sound files, and Flash files.
When you use a multimedia format for creating a custom stamp, the first frame in the file is used as 
a poster view and graphic representation for your stamp. The media does not play within a stamp 
comment. You can however, use a multimedia frame when reviewing a document when you want 
to make comments regarding multimedia imports.

2. Click Create. Click the Create button and the Select Image for Custom Stamp dialog box 
opens.
 
3. Add a new stamp. Follow the same steps for adding a stamp as you do when creating a 
new stamp. When you arrive at the Create Custom Stamp dialog box, select the category 
you want to add your stamp from in the Category pull-down menu. Type a name for your 
stamp and you arrive at the Manage Custom Stamps dialog box, as shown in Figure 20.22. 
In Figure 20.22, I appended a stamp to the MyStamps category.
 
4. Click OK. Your new stamp appears listed in the category submenu.
In the Manage Custom Stamps dialog box, you have several tools for managing stamps. Click the 
Create button to append stamps to a category or create new categories. Select a stamp and click 
Edit to modify an appearance, category name, or stamp name. Select a stamp and click Delete to 
remove a stamp from a category, or select a category and click Delete to remove an entire category. 
Click a stamp and click the Down sample stamp to reduce file size option if you want to downsam-
ple images. Apply edits and click OK. When you return to the Stamp tool pull-down menu, the 
additions/deletions are shown when you open the menu.
Pasting a Clipboard image as a stamp
Yet another Stamp tool in Acrobat is the Paste Clipboard Image as Stamp tool. Any data you copy 
to the Clipboard can be pasted as a stamp. You might want to copy an image and text together in 
a document to make a comment about a layout design or the relationship between a drawing and 
image. In a comment pop-up note, you can add annotations describing your point.
To paste data back in a document as a stamp comment, you need to first copy data; then paste it as 
a stamp comment. Listed below are the steps to copy data and paste the Clipboard data as a stamp.
STEPS: Pasting image data as a stamp comment
 
1. Open a document in Acrobat containing both images and text. For this example, we’ll 
look at copying an image and a text passage.
 
 2. Take a snapshot. Select the Snapshot tool from the Select & Zoom toolbar. Marquee an 
area you want to capture for your stamp image. When you release the mouse button, the 
data are copied to the Clipboard.
 
3. Open the Stamp tool pull-down menu and select Paste Clipboard Image as Stamp 
Tool. The cursor changes to load the Stamp tool cursor.
 
4. Add the stamp to a document page. With the cursor gun loaded as a new stamp, click 
and drag open a rectangle where you want the stamp to appear.
TIP

You can also press Ctrl/Ô+V to paste any Clipboard data as a stamp. When files are 
enabled with Adobe Reader usage rights, this keyboard shortcut also works in

5. Add a comment note. Select the Hand tool and click the stamp icon and a pop-up note 
window opens. Type a message in the note window, as shown in Figure 20.23.

on the Clipboard.
Attaching files
File attachments enable you to attach any document file, recorded sound, or pasted image on your 
hard drive to an open PDF file. When you attach files, the file is embedded in the PDF document. 
Embedding a file provides other users the capability to view attachments on other computers and 
across platforms. At first it may appear as though the attachment is a link. However, if you trans-
port the PDF document to another computer and open the attachment, the embedded file opens in 
the host application. Users on other computers need the original authoring application to view the 
embedded file. You can add file attachments in Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro, and Acrobat Pro 
Extended. You can also add file attachments in Adobe Reader when PDFs have been created with 
usage rights for Adobe Reader.

in the Comment & Markup toolbar can be categorized into two subsets. All the previous pages in 
this chapter dealt with the comment tools from the Sticky Note tool through the Attachments 
tools. Beginning with the Callout tool and moving to the right in the Comment & Markup toolbar, 
you have tools that fit into the Markup tools category.
Markup tools offer you a range of different tools that can be used with technical drawings, manu-
als, brochures, design pieces, as well as routine office memos and other such documents. These 
tools deviate from the standard highlighter and Text Edits tools in that they tend to be used as 
graphic enhancements for communicating messages. If you’re an engineer or technical writer, you 
may be inclined to use all the tools. If you’re a business professional, you may pick and choose cer-
tain tools when reviewing and marking up documents. At the least, Acrobat provides a tool for just 
about any user in any environment when it comes to review and markup.
Callout tool
 
 The Callout tool is used to note attention to an object, block of text, image, or other element on a 
page where you want to focus comments about a specific item. Notice in Figure 20.24 the Callout 
in the upper right corner of the figure.
Cloud tool
 
 The Cloud tool is used similar to the Polygon Line tool where you click, release the mouse button, 
move the cursor, click, move the cursor again, and continue until you draw a polygon shape. 
Return to the point of origin and release the mouse button and Acrobat closes the path. The paths 
appear as a cloud shape. The shape can be filled and stroked. In Figure 20.24, a shape was drawn 
with the Cloud tool, and an opacity of 25 percent was applied so the underlying area could be 
viewed with transparency.
Line tools with inline text
 
 You use the Line tools with inline text like the Dimension tool was used in earlier versions of Acrobat 
to mark or comment about the distance between two points. The mark is drawn with two lines at 
right angles to the distance line, as shown in Figure 20.24. After you draw a line you can reshape 
it, changing the angle or the length of the two lines at right angles to the distance line.
Text Box tool
 
 You use the Text Box tool for creating large blocks of text. You have more control over fonts, 
text attributes, and flexibility with the Text Box tool than when using a Note comment. Notice in 
Figure 20.24 the text in the Text Box and the options available in the Properties Bar at the bottom 
of the Toolbar Well. As text is selected in the Text Box, you have an abundant number of font attri-
bute choices in the Properties Bar.

 FIGURE 20.24
Markups shown are the 1) Cloud tool, 2) Callout tool, 3) Line tool, and 4) Text Box tool.
In the Text Box Properties dialog box, you can change opacity for text boxes, background colors, 
and line styles for borders. The remaining options are similar to properties for other comment tools.
Drawing tools
The Line tools are used for creating straight lines. You might use Line tools with or without arrow-
heads to illustrate points of interest, point out where background elements need to be moved, point 
to an object, or similar kinds of notations. These tools include:
 
  Arrow tool. The Arrow tool can be used with arrowheads, although applying arrowheads 
is a matter of user preference. You can draw straight lines on a 360-degree axis.
 
  Line tool. The Line tool can have the same attributes assigned as the preceding Arrow 
tool, making them indistinguishable from each other. The intent is for the Arrow tool to 
provide you with a line for arrowheads, whereas the Line tool remains without arrowheads. 
When marking up a document and using both line tools, you don’t need to keep address-
ing the Line Properties dialog box each time you want to toggle on or off arrowheads. It’s 
a matter of user preference, though, as you can choose to add or eliminate arrowheads 
from either tool.
 
  Rectangle tool. Use this tool to draw rectangle or square shapes. To keep the object con-
strained to a square, hold down the Shift key as you click and drag.

685
Review and Markup

  Oval tool. Using this tool involves the same process as the Rectangle tool for constraining 
objects to circles. Oval shapes are drawn without adding the Shift key.
 
  Polygon Line tool. The Polygon Line tool also creates straight lines, but the lines are 
connected as you click the cursor to move in another direction. When you finish drawing 
a shape or lines with angles, double-click the mouse button to complete the line.
 
  Polygon tool. Use the same sequence of clicking and moving as described earlier for the 
Cloud tool. When you release the mouse button back at the point of origin, the shape 
closes with flat edges instead of semicircles like the Cloud tool.
 
  Pencil tool. You use the Pencil tool to draw freeform lines. Whereas all the line tools 
draw straight lines, you use the Pencil tool for marking a page by drawing with a pencil, 
as you would with pencil and paper. The properties for pencil markings include choices 
for line weights, line colors, and line opacity settings.
 
Pencil comments are one contiguous line. If you stop drawing by releasing the mouse 
button, click, and drag again, a new comment is added to the document.
 
  Pencil Eraser tool. The Pencil Eraser tool erases lines drawn with the Pencil tool. Lines 
drawn with other tools cannot be erased with this tool. When you draw a line with 
the Pencil tool and erase part of the line, the remaining portion of a Pencil comment 
is interpreted as a single comment. Broken lines where you may have several smaller 
lines remaining after erasing part of a Pencil comment are considered part of the same 
comment.
A note pop-up is associated with the entire group of Drawing tools. You can access tool properties 
by opening a context menu on a mark drawn with any tool. In the Properties dialog box for the 
respective tool, you can change stroke and fill colors and opacities. For strokes, you can change 
line weights. As with other comment tools, you also have available in the Properties dialog box 
General attributes options and Review History options.
Drawing tools and context menus
One addition to an open context menu on one of the drawing tools is the Flip Line command. If 
you have an arrowhead on one side of a line and you want the direction to be pointing in the oppo-
site way, open a context menu and select Flip Line.
Line tool properties
Many of the same Sticky Note properties — color assignment, opacity, author, subject, and 
reviewing — are available for line tools. Additional line tool properties include line weights and 
end caps. More options are available for end caps in the Properties dialog box than in the Properties 
Bar. In Figure 20.25, the line attributes are compared between settings with the Properties Bar on 
the left and the Properties dialog box on the right.

Managing line comments
To move drawing objects, align them, or reshape them, you need to select an object with the Hand 
tool. If you experience difficulty selecting a line, it may be because the Make Hand tool select text 
check box for the Hand tool preference option is selected. If selecting drawing tool objects is awk-
ward, open the Preferences dialog box (Ctrl/Ô+K) and select General in the left pane. Disable the 
check box for Make Hand tool select text.
TIP
TIP
If you want to keep the Hand tool preferences set to select text with the tool and 
you have difficulty selecting markups, open the Comments tab and click a comment 
to select it.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on using the Hand tool for text selections, see Chapter 13.
Click an object and handles appear either at the line ends or at each end of line segments around 
polygon objects. (See Figure 20.27.) You can drag any handle in or out to resize or reshape objects. 
To move an object, click on a line or a fill color and drag the shape.
The Default Font Attributes
During the initial days of the Acrobat 8 release, many users complained that they didn’t know how 
to change the font color for Text Box comments from the default red text to black text. Perhaps more 
important to Text Box comments than any other commenting tool, you need to consistently be 
aware that there are two areas where you change properties for comment and markup tools.
When you open a context menu on a comment or markup tool and choose Properties, the Properties 
dialog box opens. You make choices as I’ve consistently addressed in this chapter for changing 
various properties. However, all properties for many tools are not included in the Properties dialog 
box — particularly the Text Box font attributes. To change text attributes for Text Box comments, 
you need to make those changes in the Properties Bar. The Text Box Text Properties open in the 
Properties Bar when the cursor is active inside a Text Box comment.
Once you change text properties in the Text Box Text Properties Bar, click outside the Text Box and 
then click the Text Box again and open a context menu. From the menu options choose Make 
Current Properties Default to change the default for the text attributes. Note that while you see an 
I-beam cursor, opening a context menu won’t provide you an option to change the defaults, which 
is why you need to first click outside the Text Box comment area.

To reshape objects, select the Hand tool, click on a handle (square shape on a line), and drag to change 
the shape.
Drawing tools comments can be copied, cut, pasted, deleted, aligned, distributed, and sized. Use 
the Select Object tool and open a context menu while one or more objects are selected. Choose a 
menu command for the operation desired.
TIP
TIP
When selecting objects with the Select Object tool, you can draw a marquee through 
objects to select them. You don’t need to completely surround comments within a 
marquee to select them.
Adding Comments to Video Files
If you opened up this book and jumped right into Comment & Markup, you missed my earlier 
claims regarding the great new integration with Adobe Flash and multimedia in Acrobat 9. As I 
covered in Chapter 7, you can drag an Adobe Flash file or any of the supported media types to the 
Acrobat 9 document pane, and your file is embedded in a new PDF document created at the frame 
size of the multimedia clip.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
Once you convert to PDF, import a multimedia file in a PDF, or add a multimedia file to 
a PDF Portfolio, you can add comment markups to the media. All the comment tools 
you use for marking up PDF documents are available to you when commenting on media clips.
Adobe has added some special features to commenting on media. When you use any one of the 
Comment & Markup tools that support a note pop-up window and when using the Callout or Text 
Box tool, the time code for the video frame is reported in the first line of text in the note.
In Figure 20.28 I added comments to four video frames in a movie clip. Notice that the time code 
for each frame is reported in all the notes.
As is with any type of comments and markups, you can view the annotations in the Comments 
panel. When you click on a comment shown in the Comments panel, the video jumps to the frame 
where the comment was added.

From the menu selections, you have the following choices:
 Show Comments List. Select this command to open the Comments panel. You can also 
open the Comments panel by clicking the Comments tab.
 Hide All Comments. Selecting the command opens a warning dialog box indicating that 
all replies in a review will be hidden. Click OK in the warning dialog box and all com-
ments are hidden from view, but still attached to the document. Return to the menu and 
Show All Comments.
 Show by Type. You can selectively show comments by type. Choices from the submenu 
include All Types, Notes, Drawing Markups, Text Editing Markups, Stamps, and 
Attachments. You can select multiple types by returning to the submenu and making 
additional selections. For example, if you want to show Notes, Stamps, and Attachments 
while hiding Drawing Markups and Text Editing Markups, select Notes, return to the 
menu, and select Stamps. Notes remain selected when you make the second selection. 
Return again and select Attachments and all three types remain in view while the other 
types remain hidden from view.
 Show by Reviewer. You can choose to show comments by one or more reviewers for 
documents retrieved from a review session. The method of selecting multiple reviewers 
follows the same behavior as with Show by Type.
 Show by Status. Also used with review sessions, you can show comments by selected 
Review status and by Migration status.

For information on status assignment, see “Using the Comments Panel” later in this 
chapter. For information on the migration options, see Chapter 21.
 Show by Checked State. You can check comments for your own personal use. Comments 
are either Checked or Unchecked in the Comments panel. From the submenu options, you 
can choose to show all checked comments, unchecked comments, or both.
 Open All Pop-ups. Opens all pop-up notes.
 Minimize All Pop-ups. Closes all pop-up notes.
 Show Connector Lines. When the mouse cursor appears over a comment, connector 
lines are shown from the comment to the comment note. If you don’t want to show the 
connector lines, select this command. By default, connector lines are shown.
 Align New Pop-ups by Default. By default, comment notes are aligned to the right side 
of the document page. When this menu item is checked, the comment notes appear aligned 
together on top of each other. Removing the check mark from this option causes note 
pop-ups to align with the note icon.

A menu dedicated to comments appears at the top-level menu bar. Open the Commenting menu 
and you find several commands redundant with the Show pull-down menu and a single command 
not available in other menus.
Unique commands in the Comments menu include:
 Commands for Comment Reviews. A fw commands appear for comment reviews such 
as Attach for Email Review, Send for Shared Review, Migrate Comments, and Track 
Reviews. Note that Tracker is also accessed in the Comments panel.

Using the Comments Panel
The Comments panel conveniently contains many tools and options for managing comments. 
By default, the Comments panel opens horizontally across the bottom of the Acrobat window like 
the Attachments panel and lists all the comments created in a PDF document. If you toggle views 
between several PDF files, the Comments panel dynamically updates the list of comments to reflect 
comments on the file active in the Document pane or in two document panes.
Depending on the size of your monitor, you’ll find that viewing the panel occupies substantial 
space in the Acrobat window. If you’re working on a small monitor, the amount of room left over 
for viewing pages, after loading toolbars in the Toolbar Well and expanding the Comments panel, 
can be very skimpy. Fortunately, you can view the panel docked in the Navigation pane and con-
trol the size by dragging the horizontal separator bar at the top of the panel down to reduce size, as 
shown in Figure 20.30.

You also have a choice for floating the panel by undocking it from the Navigation pane and resiz-
ing the panel. To undock the Comments panel, click on the tab and drag it to the Document pane. 
You can resize the panel by dragging the lower right corner in or out to reduce or expand the size.
Either way you choose to view the Comments panel, you’ll find using it to be a great asset when 
reviewing documents and participating in review sessions. At first it may be a struggle to find the 
right size and location for the panel, but with a little practice you’ll find the many tools contained 
in the panel much easier to access than using menu commands.
Viewing comments
The Comments panel lists all the comments contained in the active document. By default the 
comments are listed by page. In a multi-page document, you’ll see Page 1, Page 2, Page 3, and so 
on displayed in the list on the left side of the panel.
You can view the list of comments expanded or collapsed. In Figure 20.30, you see the list expanded. 
Expanded lists show comments in a hierarchy as bookmarks are shown in the Bookmarks pane. You 
can expand individual pages that contain comments by clicking on the plus (+) symbol (Windows) 
or the right-pointing arrow (Macintosh). To expand all comments, click the Expand All button in 
the Comments panel toolbar shown in Figure 20.31. Conversely, you can collapse all comments by 
clicking the Collapse All button. Note that in Figure 20.31 the minus (–) symbol shows the Collapse 
All tool but the text is not shown because of a lower resolution monitor view.

Comments are listed in a hierarchical order. If you have several comments on a page and you click 
on the icon to the left of the comment to expand the page comments, you see the Comment icon, 
author, and content of a note pop-up. You can further expand each comment in the expanded list 
by clicking on the plus (+) symbol (Windows) or right-pointing arrow (Macintosh). When further 
expanded, the comment subject and the creation date are displayed in the pane.
 FIGURE 20.31
Comments are ordered in a hierarchical list. By default, comments are viewed nested in a page order. The 
first three pages are expanded while the individual comments remain collapsed.
Sorting comments
 
 You can change the default Page sorting to any of the following:
 Type. Comments are sorted together by the type of comment contained on pages. All 
Note comments appear together, all highlight comments appear together, all stamps 
appear together, and so on.
 Page. The default. Comments are listed together successively by page.
 Author. If a document has comments from several different authors, the comments are 
listed by author and sorted in an alphabetical order by author name.
 Date. The creation date is the sort order with the most recent date appearing first in the list.
 Color. Comments are sorted according to the color settings made in the comment 
Properties dialog boxes.
 Checkmark Status. You can check a comment for your own personal method of flagging 
a comment. Checking comments might be made for you to alert yourself to review com-
ments, perhaps to mark them for deletion, or to spend more time in a later editing session 

694

reviewing the comments made by others. The choice for what the check mark signals is a 
personal choice. When you view comments according to Checkmark Status, all unchecked 
Comments (Unmarked) are listed first followed by comments marked with a check mark.
 Status by Person. The menu option includes a submenu where you can select an author. 
Select an author name from the submenu and comments are sorted with the comments for 
the selected author appearing first. The unchecked comments are listed next by author 
name. You must have Status set on at least one comment to activate this command.
Navigating comments
 
 The up and down arrows in the Comments toolbar enable you to move back and forth 
 between comments. Click the down-pointing arrow to move to the next comment in the 
list. Click the up-pointing arrow to navigate to a previous comment. The arrow tools are grayed 
out when comments are collapsed. In order to use the tools, you need to have one or more groups 
of comments expanded and have a comment selected.
Double-clicking a comment in the list takes you to the page where the comment appears. When 
you double-click the comment in the Comments panel, an associated pop-up note also opens. You 
must uncheck Hide comment pop-ups when Comments List is open for the note pop-ups to open 
from clicking the notes in the Comments panel.
Searching comments
 
 You can search the contents of comment pop-up notes. To find a word in a pop-up note, select the 
Search comments tool. Enter the search criteria and click Search Comments. You can also open 
the full or generic Search pane and select the Include Comments check box. The Search pane offers 
you the same search options used for searching open PDF documents. You can match case, search 
for whole words only, and other search criteria. The results of your search, however, return words 
found in the document as well as words found in comment pop-up notes.
When a word is found in a comment pop-up note, the page where the note appears opens and the 
pop-up note opens with the found word highlighted.

For more information on using the Search pane, see Chapter 6.
Printing comments
 
 The Print Comments tool does more than print the comments in a document to your printer. When 
you select the Print Comments tool, a pull-down menu opens where you can choose from two 
menu options. These menu commands include the following:
 Print Comments Summary. Use this command to create a summary page as a new PDF 
file and print the summarized comments to your default printer. The comment summary 
is a temporary file that Acrobat creates while you print the summarized comments. After 
completing the print job, Acrobat deletes the summary.

695
Review and Markup
20
 Create PDF of Comments Summary. Use this command to create a new PDF document 
that summarizes the comments in your document, rather than print a file to your printer. 
You can save this file and keep it around to review a summary of the comments.
From each of the menu commands, Acrobat defaults to “Document and comments with sequence 
numbers on separate pages.” If you want to print pages with comments configured with different 
settings, select from one of four radio button options for the way you want to view a summary. 
The radio button options appear in the Summarize Options dialog box that opens when you select 
either menu command in the Print Comments menu.

For details in regard to working with comment summaries, see the section 
“Creating Comment Summaries” later in this chapter.
Deleting comments
 
 In addition to deleting comments from the context menus used when creating comments, you can 
delete comments from within the Comments panel. Select a comment in the pane and click on the 
Trash icon to delete the selected comment. After deleting a comment, you have one level of undo 
available to you. If you change your mind after deleting a comment, choose Edit ➪ Undo. You can 
also undo selecting multiple comments and clicking on the Trash icon. Choose Edit ➪ Undo suc-
cessively if you change your mind after deleting multiple comments. In the event you lose the 
Undo command, you need to choose File ➪ Revert to bring back the comment. Be certain to 
update your PDF file after reviewing any comment deletions. The Revert command reverts to the 
last saved version of the file.
Marking comments
 
 The Checkmark tool is used to flag comments for a special purpose. You can select a 
 comment in the Comments list in the panel and select the tool to checkmark the current 
selection. You can also apply check marks to comments by clicking in the open check mark box 
when a comment is expanded. Between the expand/collapse icon and the comment icon is a check 
box. Click the box to checkmark a comment. When viewing an expanded comments list, you do 
not need to select comments in order to mark the check boxes.
Setting comment status
 
 Marking a comment with a check mark, described in the preceding section, is a method for 
 you to keep track of comments for your own purposes. The Set Status tool is used to mark 
a comment’s current status that is intended for use in comment reviews and when shared with other 
users. From the tool pull-down menu you have two subcategories for marking the status of a com-
ment. Under Review you have five choices: None, Accepted, Cancelled, Completed, and Rejected. 
Under Migration you have three choices: None, Not Confirmed, and Confirmed. These options are 
the same as those you have in the Show tool pull-down menu.

Editing comment pop-up notes
A very handy feature available to you when viewing comments in an expanded list is the ability to 
edit note pop-up text. Rather than navigating to each page containing a comment and opening the 
associated note pop-up window to make your edits, you can delete, change, or modify text listed 
in the Comments panel.
When you select the note pop-up text in the Comments panel, the note pop-up window opens in 
the Document pane. In order for the note pop-up window to open when you click a comment 
in the Comments panel, you need to make certain the Commenting preference option for Hide 
comment pop-ups when Comments List is open is unchecked. You don’t need the comment pop-
up note open to make edits in the Comments panel, but if you want to examine note pop-ups on 
the document pages, disable this preference option.
As you make changes in the Comments panel, changes are dynamically reflected in the pop-up 
note window. If you edit text in the pop-up note window, the text edits are reflected in the 
Comments panel.
Exporting and Importing Comments
If you ask a colleague to comment on a document, you can bypass the email, shared, and Acrobat.
com reviews by having a reviewer export comments and email the exported file to you. When you 
export comments from a PDF document, the data are exported as an FDF or XFDF file. The data 
file results in much smaller file sizes than PDF documents and can easily be imported back into the 
original PDF or copy of the original PDF document.
To export comments from a PDF document, open the Comments menu. Three menu commands 
exist for exporting comments. Choose Comments ➪ Export Comments to Word to export the com-
ments directly to a Microsoft Word document. Choose Export Comments to AutoCAD to export 
comments directly to an AutoCAD .dwg file. The third option is Export Comments to a Data File. 
When you choose this option you can select either FDF or XFDF as your file format. Using these 
two formats, you can import the data file comments back into your PDF document. Choose 
Comments ➪ Import Comments to import the data file comments into your PDF file.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on exporting comments to AutoCAD files, see Chapter 7. For 
exporting to MS Word files, see Chapter 8.
Exporting/importing comments to and from a file
When you export comments to a file, the Export Comments dialog box opens. The dialog box 
behaves similarly to a Save As dialog box where you select a destination folder, provide a filename, 
and click a Save button. Acrobat provides a default name by using the PDF filename with a .fdf 
extension. You can use the default name or change the name in the File Name field box. From the 
Save as Type (Windows) or Format (Macintosh) pull-down menu, you can select between FDF 
formatted files and XFDF (XML-based FDF) files. The default is FDF.

697
Review and Markup
20
Click Save in the Export Comments dialog box. The resulting file can be exported to a user who 
has the same PDF document from which the FDF file was created. If you receive an FDF file and 
want to load the comments, choose Comments ➪ Import Comments. The Import Comments dialog 
box opens. Navigate to the location where the data file is located and select it. Click the Select but-
ton and the comments are imported into the open PDF document.
NOTE
NOTE
You have three file format options — not only FDF and XFDF for export, but also 
PDF. If someone sends you a PDF with comments, you can import those comments 
directly to your version without having to export them from your reviewer’s copy and then 
import into your copy.
When you import comments in a PDF document, all the comments are imported in the exact loca-
tion where they were originally created. If you delete a page in a PDF file and import comments, 
Acrobat ignores comments where it can’t find matching pages. Note pop-ups and icons are 
matched with the way they appear in the file from which the comments were exported.
Exporting selected comments
You can select comments and choose to export only the selected comments to an FDF or XFDF 
file. Open the Comments panel and select comments according to the sort order listed in the 
Comments panel. The default is by page. Select a page in the list and open the Options pull-down 
menu from the Comments panel toolbar. Select Export Selected Comments from the menu 
options.
The Export Comments dialog box opens. Navigate your hard drive to find the folder where you 
want to save the FDF or XFDF file, provide a name for the file, and click the Save button.
TIP
TIP
When exporting all comments leave the filename for the FDF or XFDF exported file 
at the default provided by Acrobat. When exporting Selected Comments, be certain 
to edit the filename. By default, Acrobat uses the same name. If you elect to export all comments 
and then want to export selected comments, you might mistakenly overwrite files with the same 
filename. By getting into a habit of being consistent when naming files, you’ll prevent potential 
mistakes.
Filtering Comments
You can further enhance the features available to you for review and markup, exporting and 
importing comments, and viewing comments in the Comments panel, by filtering comments in 
groups. Filtering comments temporarily hides comments you don’t want to use at the moment. 
You can choose to display all comments by an author, a date, a reviewer, selected types of com-
ments, and a range of other criteria. When comments are filtered, exporting comments or creating 
comment summaries (explained in the next section) is applied only to those comments currently 
viewed. Any hidden comments are excluded from the task at hand.

comments with the items you checked during the review are exported to Word.
The remaining menu options include non-filtering menu choices such as opening/closing note 
pop-ups, showing connector lines, aligning icons and pop-up notes, and accessing the Comment 
preferences. You can also make these menu selections from other tools and menus as described 
earlier in this chapter.
Creating Comment Summaries
If you create an extensive review from many participants over a period of time, the number of 
comments may become too many to comfortably manage in the Comments panel or on the docu-
ment pages. Or you may have a need to create a comment summary you want to distribute to users 
after filtering out comments that you don’t want included in a summary. Furthermore, you may 
want to print a hard copy of comments that show the PDF pages with connector lines to a summary 
description. You can accomplish all these tasks and more when you create comment summaries.
To create a comment summary, you need to have a PDF document open in the Document pane and 
comments in view in the Comments panel. The pane can be open or collapsed. Comments can be 
filtered according to the sorts and filtering you want to apply, but at least one comment with the 
criteria must exist for a summary report to contain comment information.
If the Comments panel is collapsed, you create a comment summary by opening the Comment 
menu and selecting Summarize Comments. If the Comments panel is open, you can choose 
the menu command from the Options menu.
When you select Summarize Comments from either menu command, the Summarize Options 
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 20.32.
The first four radio buttons in the dialog box offer you choices for the way the summary pages are 
created and the page layout view, which may contain single page views or Continuous – Facing 
Pages views. The resulting summaries are created as separate PDF documents.

Select Summarize Comments from the Comments menu or a context menu in the Comments panel to open 
the Summarize Options dialog box.
Choices for creating a comment summary in the Summarize Options dialog box include:
 Document and comments with connector lines on separate pages. This option creates 
a comment summary with each summary page aside the respective document page with 
connector lines from each comment on a page to the summarized item in a new summary. 
When the summary is created, Acrobat automatically switches to a Two-Up Continuous 
layout. If you don’t want a continuous view and you want the pages to snap to fit in the 
Document pane, select View ➪ Page Display ➪ Two-Up. In Figure 20.33, you see a sum-
mary of a document and comments with connector lines on separate pages shown in a 
Two-Up view.
 Document and comments with connector lines on single pages. The summary is 
similar to the preceding option; however, the PDF document and the summary are cre-
ated together on a single landscape page. The size of the paper is determined by the set-
ting specified in the Paper size pull-down menu. One advantage for this summary view 
compared to the preceding summary is the comments, connector lines, and summary 
data require a little less room on your monitor to view the original file and the summary 
information. Furthermore, if you export summaries for other users, the summarized 
information and original file are assembled together in a single document.

 Comments only. Only the summarized data are assembled together on single pages. The 
comment summaries are shown in a hierarchy according to the sort order you select in 
this dialog box. The page layout is a single page view.
 Document and comments with sequence numbers on separate pages. Summaries are 
created similarly to the method described in the preceding bullet, but with the addition 
of sequence numbers assigned to each comment according to the sort order and the order 
in which the comments were created. The page layout view is Two-Up Continuous, which 
shows the comments with sequence numbers and the resulting summary in the opposing 
page view.
 Paper size. From the pull-down menu, select a paper size according to the sizes available 
for your selected printer.
 Sort comments by. From the pull-down menu you can choose from four different options. 
The default is a sort according to Page. If you want another sort order, choose from Author, 
Type, or Date from the pull-down menu options. The sort order selected in the Summarize 
Options dialog box supersedes the sort order selected in the Comments panel.
 Font Size. Applies to the font used in the comment summary description on the newly 
created pages. Depending on the size selected, the summary pages may be fewer (Small) 
or more (Large). The point size for small is 5 points, for medium 6.75 points, and for 
large 9 points.
 Include. All comments summarizes all comments on the PDF pages regardless of whether 
the comments are in view or hidden. The Only the comments currently showing option 
creates a comment summary from the comments visible in the Comments panel.
 Pages containing no comments. Check the box if you want pages containing no com-
ments included in the summary. Disable the check box and only pages with comments 
are included in the summary.

 Opacity. Applies an opacity setting for the connector lines.
Comment summaries are particularly useful when sending PDF documents to Adobe Reader users. 
Although Reader users can see comments you create in a PDF document, they cannot create com-
ment summaries. You can create a summary for a Reader user and append the new document to 
the existing PDF file, and then send the file to other members in your workgroup.
Comparing Documents
If you set up a review for users to provide feedback on a document, you may incorporate recom-
mended changes in a file. As you work on modifying files, you may end up with several documents 
in different development stages. If you aren’t quite certain which document contains your finished 
edits, you may have a need to compare files to check for the most recent updates. Acrobat’s Compare 
Documents feature (Acrobat Pro and Acrobat Pro Extended only) provides you a method for analyz-
ing two files and reporting all differences between them.
To compare two documents choose Document ➪ Compare Documents. The Compare Documents 
dialog box opens. You can open the dialog box without any file open in the Document pane, or 
open both files to compare and then select the menu command. In Figure 20.34, I have two files 
titled Chapter08tn.pdf and Chapter08wd.pdf. Because these two files are similar docu-
ments, I’m not certain which document contains revisions. Therefore, the documents are selected 
for comparison to check the differences.
 FIGURE 20.34
Choose Document  ➪ Compare Documents to open the Compare Documents dialog box.

702
PDF Interactivity
Part IV
The Compare Documents dialog box contains the following options:
 Compare (older document)/To (newer document). The first two items are used to 
identify the documents for comparison. If no files are open in the Document pane, click 
the Choose button and select a file in the Open dialog box that appears. Click the second 
Choose button and open a second file. If you have the two documents to be compared 
open in the Document pane before opening the Compare Documents dialog box, the 
pull-down menus show you both open files. Select one file in the top pull-down menu 
and the second file in the next pull-down menu.
 Document Description. Three options are available from radio button choices at the 
bottom of the dialog box. Depending on which item you choose, the reports are more or 
less detailed and the speed in which the documents are compared relate to how much 
detail you want to analyze. Reports, spreadsheets, and magazine layouts perform textual 
searches and may take longer than the other choices.
 Presentation decks, drawings or illustrations. Use this option when comparing docu-
ments with vector art illustrations, PowerPoint presentations, and other documents that 
contain heavy illustration components.
 Scanned documents. Choose this option when comparing raster artwork scanned from 
paper documents such as forms (or two photographs).
The Compare Documents feature in Acrobat 9 is one of the major new improvements to Acrobat 
Pro and Acrobat Pro Extended. When you make your choices in the Compare Documents dialog 
box including selecting the files you want to compare and click OK, Acrobat reports results in the 
Compare panel shown in Figure 20.35. The summary shown in the Document pane immediately 
reports back to you if differences exist between the documents.
Acrobat makes it easy for you to begin your examination of the compared documents. Click the 
Get started: First change is on page n (where n reports the page where the first change is encoun-
tered). Also on the summary page you see a legend indicating markups you’ll find in the compared 
documents. As shown in Figure 20.35 these include Highlight, Deleted, an up arrow, and two 
opposing arrows with definitions for what the symbols mean.
Click the text where you see Get started: First change is on page 1 and the page where the first 
change occurred is opened in the Document pane as shown in Figure 20.36. In the top right corer 
of the Document pane you find another legend reporting the types of changes found between the 
documents. Above the highlights on the page are comment notes that offer more detail on the spe-
cific differences found between the documents.

detect where the change was found between the Old text and the New text as you can see in the 
comment note shown in Figure 20.38.
 FIGURE 20.37
Comment notes report specific changes found between the compared documents.
When comparing images Acrobat provides a nice quick view to detect changes. As you move the 
cursor over an image that has been changed in one of the documents, a popup window opens dis-
playing both documents and the image comparison as shown in Figure 20.38.

Summary
 Acrobat provides an extensive set of Comment preferences. Before beginning any review 
session you should review the preference settings by choosing Edit ➪ Preferences and 
clicking on Commenting in the left pane.
 A single toolbar in Acrobat 8 contains all the Comment & Markup tools.
 Most comments created in Acrobat have associated note pop-up windows where you can 
type comments.
 You access comment properties by opening context menus from a note icon or pop-up 
note title bar.
 You can create custom stamps in Acrobat from a variety of different file formats.
 Acrobat 9 enables you to add all the comment and markup types to video frames in 
movie clips and Flash video files.

 You can enable usage rights for Adobe Reader users to participate in comment reviews 
from Acrobat Pro. And Acrobat Pro Extended.
 Comments can be filtered and sorted to isolate authors, types, dates, and other criteria. 
When exporting comments, only the sorted comments in view in the Comments panel 
are exported.
 Comments exported from a document can be imported into a matching PDF file, a Word 
file, and an AutoCAD file.
 When exporting comments from Acrobat as a file, the comments data are saved as FDF or 
XFDF and result in smaller file sizes.
 Comment summaries are displayed in one of four different report styles. When a summary 
is created it can be sorted upon creation and saved as a separate PDF file.
 The new Acrobat 9 Compare Documents feature enables you to locate differences between 
two PDF documents and analyze the comparison in the Compare panel. Reports are gen-
erated with comments describing found differences in detail.

T
hroughout this book, I address the use of PDFs on the Web, and 
in several chapters, I’ve talked about Acrobat.com. As I discussed in 
Chapter 9, you can download selected Web pages or entire Web sites 
and have all the HTML pages converted to PDF. In Chapter 12 I talked about 
sharing PDF Portfolios on Acrobat.com.
Coming ahead in Chapter 29 I talk about Web conferencing and sharing 
files. In Chapter 30, I talk about eBooks and downloading eBooks; in 
Chapter 34 I talk about submitting form data to Acrobat.com; and in other 
chapters you find similar discussions on Acrobat PDFs hosted online and 
using the new sharing services provided via Acrobat.com. In short, the Web 
plays a major role with much of your Acrobat activity.
This chapter builds on information covered in Chapter 20 where I discussed 
using the commenting tools, menus, and Comments panel. In this chapter 
I cover commenting through Attach for Email Review and Send for Shared 
Review on Acrobat.com, which are, again, other uses for PDFs and the 
Internet.
Setting Up the Commenting for 
Reviews Environment
Commenting in review sessions requires use of the same tools discussed in 
Chapter 20. If you haven’t read Chapter 20, take a moment to read how to 
load commenting tools and open the Comments panel. The tools you need 
to follow along in this chapter are the Comment & Markup tools and the 
Properties Bar. Load these tools as explained in Chapter 20.

Creating an Attach for Email Review
The abundant number of comment tools, properties, and menu commands are nothing more than 
overkill if all you want to do is add some note comments on PDF pages for your own use. Acrobat 
is designed with much more sophistication when it comes to commenting, and the tools provided 
to you are intended to help you share comments in workgroups.
Comment and review among workgroups is handled in two ways. You can set up an Attach for 
Email Review and exchange comments with your co-workers and colleagues where PDFs and data 
are exchanged through email, or you can set up a Send for Shared Review where participants upload 
and download comments to a shared folder on a network or Web server in the review process.
Adobe’s Acrobat team wanted to make it almost seamless for any user to not only start a review 
session but participate in review sessions. With the ability to enable documents with usage rights 
for Adobe Reader users, anyone with the free Adobe Reader software can participate in an email or 
shared review.

For more information on adding usage rights to PDFs, see Chapters 19 and 20.
Initiating an Attach for Email Review
An Attach for Email Review is a method for you, the PDF author, to share a document that needs 
input from other members of a workgroup (in an email exchange), such as a proposal or draft doc-
ument, and ask them to make comments for feedback. As comments are submitted, you can track 
comments from others and make decisions about how the comments are treated. Decisions such 
as accepting or rejecting comments are part of this process. The comment exchanges between you 
and your workgroup members are handled through email. When using this kind of review, the 
review initiator is the only person who sees comments from all the reviewers.
When you send a file for review, the PDF contains information about you, the author/initiator, who’s 
invited to the review, and where the original is located on your system. When a recipient receives 
the email inviting him or her to review your document, the attachment to the email is a PDF the 
recipients use to make comments. The recipients open the PDF email attachment in Acrobat or 
Adobe Reader and make comments. When a reviewer finishes commenting, the reviewer sends the 
data back to the PDF author. The data sent from the reviewers can either be a Form Data File (FDF) 
or both the data and the PDF document (choices are made in Reviewing preferences discussed later 
in this chapter). If you start with a large PDF file, the comment exchanges using FDF data require 
much less data transfers because the comment data are typically much smaller than original PDF files.
When reviews are initiated, you must send the PDF file to all reviewers. You can then make a deci-
sion in the Reviewing preferences for whether the PDF or an FDF file is returned back to you. In 
the Preferences dialog box, click Reviewing and type a value in the Send comments as FDF for files 

709
Working with Review Sessions
21
greater than text box. The default is 5MB. Therefore, FDF data are returned for all files greater than 
5MB. You can raise or lower the number by typing a new value in the text box. This setting is 
applied only to comments returned back to you. If you have a PDF greater than 5MB — or any file 
size for that matter — you must first send the PDF document to the recipients.
When comments are returned to you either in PDF or FDF form, double-click the file attachment 
in your email application. Double-clicking either file type appends comments from recipients to 
your original PDF you used when you invited recipients to participate in a review.
NOTE
NOTE
Before initiating a review, be certain to add your email address in the Identity pref-
erences. If you don’t add the Identity preferences, Acrobat prompts you in a dialog 
box and opens the Identity preferences for you. You can’t proceed until you fill in the prefer-
ence text boxes. Open the Preferences dialog box and select Identity. Add your personal iden-
tity information including your email address. The email address supplied in the Identity 
preferences is used when emailing PDFs from within Acrobat.
To understand how to start an email-based review, follow these steps.
STEPS: Initiating an email-based review
 
1. Open a document in Acrobat Pro or Pro Extended. Opening a document is optional 
because you can begin a review without a document open in the document pane. In this 
example, I start with a document open in Acrobat Pro. If using Acrobat Standard, you can 
initiate an email-based review, but you cannot enable the document with usage rights for 
Adobe Reader users for commenting. Enabling usage rights in Acrobat Standard is limited 
to enabling forms for form saves and digital signatures. If using Acrobat Pro or Pro 
Extended, you have an option for enabling the document for Reader users to participate 
in your review.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on enabling PDF documents using Acrobat products, see 
Chapter 19.
 
2. Initiate the review. If you want to make a comment on your document you can do so, 
but you need to be certain to save all your updates. After saving the file, select Attach 
for Email Review from the Comment task button pull-down menu. The first pane in the 
Getting Started wizard opens, as shown in Figure 21.1. This is the first of three panes 
appearing in the wizard when you initiate a review.
 
 By default, documents active in the document pane are specified in the field box in the 
first pane. If you change your mind or you start a review without a document open in 
Acrobat, click the Browse button and browse your hard drive to locate a file.

6. Send the mail. If your email program does not immediately send the invitation to review-
ers, open your default email program and click the Send (or Send/Receive) button to 
commence the email initiation. In Figure 21.5, an invitation appears in Microsoft Outlook 
showing a recipient in the To field, the Subject of the email, and a file attachment. The 
message is derived from the Preview Invitation dialog box. Note that before initiating a 
send, you can still edit the message. Click the Send (or Send/Receive) button to send the 
email and attachment to the reviewers.
 FIGURE 21.5
If your default email program does not send the message, open the program and click 
the Send (or Send/Receive) button.
When you send your file for an email review by following the steps in the Attach for Email Review 
wizard, your file is enabled automatically with Adobe Reader usage rights. There’s nothing special 
you have to do to enable the PDF document for Adobe Reader users to participate in the review. 
Be certain all your Reader users are working in Adobe Reader version 7 and above and all Acrobat 
users are working with Acrobat 6 and above.
Any kind of review you initiate appears in the Tracker where you can monitor reviews, invite new 
reviewers, set deadlines and end a review session. For more information on the Tracker, see the 
section “Using the Tracker” later in this chapter.
Participating in a review
Participants in a review include you — the PDF author and review initiator — and the people you 
select as reviewers. In your role, you field all comments from reviewers. If you use Attach for Email 
Review to send comments back to users, Acrobat does permit you to reply to users’ comments. A 
review session is designed for a single set of responses; however, if you want, you can exchange 
comments back and forth with the reviewers.
Before you begin a review, be certain to save any edits made on the PDF. If you insert pages, delete 
pages, or perform a number of other edits without saving, the comments retrieved from others 
will appear out of place and make it difficult to understand where comments are made from the 
reviewers. Also, be certain to keep the original PDF in the same folder. If you decide to move 
the PDF to another folder, be certain to keep track of the location where the PDF resides. As you 

713
Working with Review Sessions
21
update comments, Acrobat needs to keep track of the directory path where the original PDF can be 
found. If Acrobat can’t find the PDF, you are prompted to search for it.
TIP
TIP
If you want to relocate a PDF file in a review to another folder while maintaining 
the link in Acrobat to the file, use the Tracker and send the file to a new folder. For 
more on the Tracker, see “Using the Tracker” later in this chapter.
During a review period you and your recipients use tools in Acrobat designed for use with email 
reviews. When starting an email review, the first time you access the Attach for Email Review 
menu command, the PDF is sent to recipients. All subsequent comment exchanges between you 
and reviewers are handled with other tools. Be certain to not return to the Attach for Email Review 
command if you decide to respond to user comments. Doing so sends another PDF to a recipient.
Recipient participation
A recipient receiving your email with the PDF attachment can open the attachment directly within 
the email message. Double-clicking the email file attachment launches Acrobat and loads the PDF 
in the document pane.

Author participation
When a reviewer sends a comment to you, you double-click the email attachment and Acrobat 
detects that the attachment is part of an email review. A dialog box opens as shown in Figure 21.7, 
prompting you to merge the comments with your original file that you sent for review.
 FIGURE 21.7
Double-click an attachment with recipient comments and you are prompted to merge the comments in 
your original PDF that you submitted for an email review.
Click Yes and Acrobat opens with the Comment & Markup toolbar as a floating toolbar and the 
Comments panel expanded as shown in Figure 21.8. As comments are submitted from reviewers, 
you’ll want to track reviews and decide to mark them for a status. If you want to reply to the recip-
ients you can elect to send a reply to recipient comments; however, in some cases you’ll want to 
make corrections and start a new review session. If you send a reply, each comment is treated as a 
separate thread in Acrobat. Instead of your having to select different tools to make responses scat-
tered around a document page, Acrobat keeps each thread nestled together to make following a 
thread easier. Replies are contained in Note pop-up windows as shown in Figure 21.8. If you want 
to reply to a comment, open a context menu on the note pop-up and select Reply, or select Reply 
from the Options pull-down menu on a comment note. Additionally you can click the Reply tool 
in the Comments panel.

Updating comments
You send a file to recipients for review. The reviewers then send comments back to you. Your 
original document needs updating to reflect the new additions added by other reviewers. When 
you receive an email attachment, the comment data are submitted back to you. Only a single PDF 
resides on your computer. If you want to merge the data sent by other reviewers with your existing 
PDF document, double-click the file attachment sent back to you. Acrobat updates the original PDF 
document with the new comments.
Asking new reviewers to participate
You may begin a review and later decide you want to add new users to participate in the review. You 
can add new reviewers to a review at any time. To add a reviewer, choose Comments ➪ Invite 
Additional Reviewers or you can open the Tracker and invite additional reviewers directly in the 
Tracker (see the next section in this chapter). The same Attach for Email Review wizard opens as 
shown earlier in Figure 21.1. Walk through the steps to add new reviewers and the same PDF file 
is sent to additional reviewers via an email attachment. Note that you can also add new reviewers 
in the Tracker.

Using the Tracker
The Tracker is a separate window that opens on top of the Acrobat window where you find menu 
commands to help manage email-based, browser-based, and shared reviews. To open the Tracker, 
select Track Reviews from the Comment task button or choose Comments ➪ Track Reviews; or, 
from the Options pull-down menu in the Comments panel, select Track Reviews. Any one of the 
three menu items opens the Tracker shown in Figure 21.9.

The Tracker window provides information and tools for working with documents in review.
Viewing documents in the Tracker
The left pane in the Tracker lists all documents you have in review. From the list, select a filename 
and open a context menu. From the menu choices select Open. The respective file opens in the 
document pane.
Two categories appear in the left pane in Figure 21.9. All reviews I initiated are listed in the Sent 
list. Expand the list to see reviews by filename. The Joined list contains all reviews sent to me by 
another review initiator. Additional categories can appear in the Tracker depending on the work 
you perform for reviews and for distributing forms.

about a review opens in the document pane as a new PDF file.
 Create New Folder. Choose Create New Folder to open the New Folder dialog box. Type 
a name for the new folder and the folder appears in the Reviews ➪ Sent list. You can add 
reviews and save the files together in the new folder.
 Send To Folder. From the submenu all the new folders you create are listed here. Rather 
than drag and drop files to new folders you create, open a context menu on a file and choose 
Send to Folder ➪ <new folder name> to neatly organize your reviews in individual folders.
On Windows a collapsed list is marked with a plus (+) symbol. On the Macintosh, a collapsed list

Tracking forms
The Tracker also lists all forms you have distributed. Clicking a form changes the Tracker options 
in the right pane. You have many new options in Acrobat 9 for tracking distributed forms. Rather 
than go into detail now about tracking forms, I explain more in Chapter 35.
Working with Shared Reviews
In Acrobat 8, Adobe made an effort to make shared reviews a little easier; however, the complicated 
process for configuring servers remained a mystery to many Acrobat users and didn’t eliminate a 
necessary dependence on an IT department to help configure a server for online commenting. From 
the beginning when browser-based reviews where introduced in Acrobat 5, Adobe has been trying 
to simplify review sessions for people to comment on documents in real time where all participants 
can see each other’s comments, or comment online where people can easily exchange comments in 
a review session. We’ve seen simplicity added in each release of Acrobat, but one aspect for devel-
oping a seamless environment for online commenting was still needed.
The bottleneck in the seamless operation of the shared review process has always been working 
with online servers. Unless you had a properly configured server, sharing comments online was 
impossible in Acrobat 8 and earlier viewers. What was required was technical assistance by a com-
pany’s IT department to configure a server to support online commenting. For individual users and 
small businesses without sophisticated IT departments, online commenting just wasn’t available in 
Acrobat 8 and earlier viewers.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
Now in Acrobat 9, Adobe has developed the last leg of the seamless operation for 
online comment and review. This final element of simplicity for engaging in shared 
reviews is handled through the Acrobat.com services available to users in the entire Acrobat 9 
family of products.

Understanding shared review options
You have several choices to make when engaging in shared reviews. You can share reviews locally 
on your computer and on network servers, or you can share reviews on a Web server. In regard to 
Web servers, you have several types of Web servers from which to choose. Depending on the choice 
you make, the process can be very simple or quite complicated.

720

Part IV
Among the choices you have for setting up a shared review are
 Acrobat.com. You can set up review sessions on Acrobat.com without having to worry 
about any special configurations of a server to collect comments and integrate the com-
ments from multiple users.
 Network Folder. You can configure a network folder locally on your intranet to set up a 
shared review among a workgroup.
 SharePoint Workspace. For Windows SharePoint workspaces, users need to have read 
and write access to engage in reviews. This option requires some help from your IT 
department to configure the server and set up the permissions for the participants.
 Web Server. Again, this option requires some help from your IT department to configure 
a Web server with a shared folder and configure the participants for read/write services.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
One of the best new additions to Acrobat 9 is the introduction of Acrobat.com. This 
choice takes the configuration steps out of the process for initiating and engaging 
in shared reviews. For individuals and small companies without intranets and sophisticated IT 
departments, using Acrobat.com is something you’ll learn to love.
For the purposes of this chapter, I’ll cover only two of the options you have for conducting shared 
reviews — setting up network folders and using Acrobat.com. If you work in an enterprise where 
you want to share reviews on Web servers, look to the Acrobat Help document and online infor-
mation you can find at www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/online_collabora-
tion.pdf and www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/online_review_admin.html.
Using network folders
Setting up a network folder for shared reviews is intended for workgroups having internal local 
area networks. You begin setting up a network folder the same way as when using Acrobat.com 
for shared reviews. From a menu command, a wizard opens that walks you through the steps to 
configure a folder on a network server.
To see how easy it is to set up a network folder for shared reviews, do the following:
STEPS: Starting a shared review using a network folder
 
1. Open the Comment task button pull-down menu and select Send For Shared 
Review. The Send for Shared Review Wizard opens as shown in Figure 21.11.
 
2. Choose a location for collecting reviewer’s comments. Open the pull-down menu at 
the top of the Send for Shared Review wizard and choose Automatically collect comments 
on my own internal server.

3. Select a host. Click Next in the Send for Shared Review wizard and the second pane in 
the wizard opens as shown in Figure 21.12. For setting up a network folder, click the first 
radio button for Network folder.
 
4. Target a location to host your review. Click the Browse button to open the Browse For 
Folder dialog box as shown in Figure 21.13. Choose a directory path, and if you need a 
new folder created, click the Make New Folder button. Name a new folder and click OK. 
Click OK in the Browse For Folder dialog box and you return to the second pane in the 
Send for Shared Review wizard.

If you want to create a new folder, click the Make New Folder button. When the direc-
tory path is established, click OK to return to the Send for Shared Review wizard.
 
5. Review the configuration summary. Click Next and the third pane in the Send for Shared 
Review wizard opens. This pane summarizes your choice for the location where the com-
ments will be collected as shown in Figure 21.14. Review the summary and click Next.

723

 FIGURE 21.14
Review the summary and click Next to complete the network folder setup.
 
6. Determine how you want to distribute the PDF document for review. You basically 
have two choices when you arrive at the last pane in the Send for Review wizard. Choose 
either Adobe Acrobat or Save a local copy and manually send the file later to recipients. If 
you choose the second option, you have to manually send the document to reviewers. The 
space on the network server will collect comments from all the reviewers. When you finish 
the setup, the PDF document appears in the document pane with a message informing 
you that the file has been saved to your local hard drive and you can send the file at any 
time to recipients as shown in Figure 21.15.
 FIGURE 21.15
When you finish the network folder setup, the PDF document appears in the document 
pane with a message informing you that you can send the file at any time to recipients.

724
PDF Interactivity
Part IV
In the Document Message bar in Figure 21.15, you find some new options for commenting. The 
Check for New Comments button checks the network folder for new comments that recipients add 
and populates your PDF document with new comments. The Publish Comments button uploads 
any new comments you add to the PDF file as XML data collected at the network folder.
From the pull-down menu adjacent to the Publish Comments button, you have a few choices for 
opening the Tracker and working offline. If you work in an area where you don’t have access to 
your server, choose Work Offline and you can make comments while on the road. When you return 
to your office and connect to the network folder, your offline comments can be published.
Setting up shared reviews on Acrobat.com
Perhaps the easiest way to initiate and participate in shared reviews is via Acrobat.com. As I’ve said 
before in this chapter, you don’t have to worry about any configurations as long as you have set up 
your Adobe ID and can log on to Acrobat.com. This option provides you a seamless, hassle-free 
approach to engaging in shared reviews.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For setting up an Adobe ID and logging on to Acrobat.com, see Chapter 29.
To learn how easy it is to initiate and participate in shared reviews on Acrobat.com, do the following:
STEPS: Starting a shared review using Acrobat.com
 
1. Open the Comment task button pull-down menu and select Send For Shared 
Review. The Send for Shared Review wizard opens the same as shown earlier in 
Figure 21.11.
 
2. Choose Acrobat.com for your host. When you open the Send for Shared Review 
wizard, choose Automatically download & track comments with Acrobat.com.
 
3. Log on to Acrobat.com with your Adobe ID. Click Next to open the Send for Shared 
Review Adobe ID log-on pane as shown in Figure 21.16. Type your ID and password 
and click Sign In to log on to Acrobat.com.
 
4. Identify recipients. The next item you see is an email message box in the Send for 
Shared Review wizard as shown in Figure 21.17. Type the names of recipients in the To 
text box. If you want to edit the subject and/or message you can edit the respective items 
in the wizard. Click Send and several things happen to your PDF document:
 The file you send to Acrobat.com is enabled with Adobe Reader usage rights so Adobe 
Reader users can participate in the review.
 The email message is sent to your list of recipients when you click the Send button.
 The file is automatically uploaded to Acrobat.com. You don’t need to bother with any-
thing else other than identifying your recipients and clicking the send button. What 
could be easier?

Part IV
Amazingly, the list of the four preceding steps is all you have to do to initiate a shared review using 
Acrobat.com. Comments, publishing comments, and downloading comments is handled just like 
using network folders described in the section “Using Network Folders” earlier in this chapter.
Acrobat confirms your upload with a message box, as shown in Figure 21.18, when you click the 
Send button in the email message. As with network folder reviews, you have a Check for New 
Reviews button and a Publish Comments button to download recipient comments and upload 
your own comments.
 FIGURE 21.18
The same buttons for checking for new comments and publishing comments available with network fold-
ers are identical when engaging in reviews on Acrobat.com.
When you check for comments on Acrobat.com by clicking the Check for New Comments button 
in the Document Message bar, new comments added in the review are reported in a message box 
as shown in Figure 21.19. To accept the comment, click the Click here to accept text link and the 
comments are downloaded and populate your PDF document on your computer.
 FIGURE 21.19
When new comments are downloaded from Acrobat.com, a message box reports the number of comments 
added to your PDF file.
On Windows, you can easily monitor new comment additions on Acrobat.com in the Windows 
Status Bar as shown in Figure 21.20. A mouseover on the Tracker icon in the Status Bar reports 
any activity or no activity with shared reviews. Right-click the Tracker icon and choose Open 
Tracker from a context menu and the Tracker opens.

727

 FIGURE 21.20
You can open the Tracker for reviews and when distributing forms from a context menu opened on the 
Tracker icon in the Windows Status Bar.
Additional items you have available in the Tracker when working with shared reviews include chang-
ing the deadline for a review and ending a review. In Figure 21.21 the text for these items open win-
dows for informing recipients that a review deadline has been extended or the review has ended.
 FIGURE 21.21
You can extend a review or end a review using the Tracker.
PROXY Reviewers
One of the coolest things that shared reviews can offer is PROXY. Imagine an Adobe (or any 
company) employee wants to invite you to participate in a review. The Adobe employee uses 
a shared folder to start a review. However, access to the Adobe Web server is limited to only 
Adobe employees.
An employee decides to add you to the review, but you don’t have access to the shared folder on 
the Adobe network. You receive the PDF via email and try to connect to the shared folder and, of 
course, you can’t. Using shared reviews still makes it possible for you to add your comments to the 
document.

728
PDF Interactivity
Part IV
Participating in such a review provides you new options on the status bar (see Figure 21.22) where 
you select Send Comments. Instead of accessing the secure network folder limited to Adobe 
employees, your comments are emailed to the review initiator who can then inject these comments 
to the review and (here’s the cool part) they show up as “Reviewer name (Adobe employee) by 
your name,” making it clear that the Adobe employee made the comment but you added it to the 
review cycle.
 FIGURE 21.22
When participating as a PROXY reviewer, click Send Comments in the status bar to email your comments 
to the review initiator.
Commenting in Real-Time
An option for the hurried or impatient user is real-time commenting. Through the use of Acrobat.
com and Web conferencing, you can host a meeting where you can share files. Without a commer-
cial subscription to Acrobat Connect or Acrobat Connect Pro, your real-time commenting is lim-
ited to three people (you and two participants).
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
Web conferencing and sharing files in real time is covered in Chapter 29.
Migrating Comments
You might have an edit you make on a document and want to populate the document with com-
ments made in review sessions. Acrobat provides you a method to import new or unresolved 
comments to a PDF after the document has been revised using the Migrate Comments feature. This 
feature attempts to place comments in the correct location by searching specific word groupings 
and structural elements in a revised PDF.
NOTE
NOTE
Results may be less reliable in untagged PDFs that lack the internal structure neces-
sary to correctly place imported comments in a revised document.
In order to migrate comments from one file to another, you need both documents open in Acrobat. 
Bring the document you want to import comments into forward in the document pane. Select 
Comments ➪ Migrate Comments to open the Migrate Comments dialog box, as shown in Figure 
21.23. Select the other file open in the document pane in the From pull-down menu and click OK. 
Your file gets populated with all the comments from the review file.

If you open the properties on a comment markup and check the Review history, you should see a 
list of the Migration history in the dialog box, as shown in Figure 21.24. All comment migration is 
listed in the Review History tab for assessing the dates and times you migrated comments.
 FIGURE 21.24
The Review History in the comment properties shows a list of Migration history.
Sharing Comments in PDF Portfolios
The one item that we don’t have available with shared reviews is sharing PDF Portfolios in review 
sessions. Adobe admits that there are case uses for engaging in shared reviews with PDF Portfolios, 
but unfortunately it’s just not in the cards in this release of Acrobat.
With all the new tools you have available with Acrobat 9, you can create some workarounds. Here’s 
a list of some of the more important issues related to commenting on files in PDF Portfolios:

730
PDF Interactivity
Part IV
 Share files in review sessions before you assemble a PDF Portfolio. You can share 
individual files using shared reviews on Acrobat.com, then assemble your PDF Portfolio 
after completing review sessions. This option could be the easiest workaround you have if 
there are many files in your portfolio.
 Enable PDFs before sharing a portfolio. If you decide to share a PDF Portfolio, you’ll 
need to enable each PDF document in the portfolio if you intend to share the portfolio 
with Adobe Reader users.
TIP
TIP
You can assemble a PDF Portfolio and enable PDFs within the portfolio after 
assembly.
 Share a portfolio on Acrobat.com. If you want to share a portfolio with other users for 
the purpose of commenting and review, choose File ➪ Collaborate ➪ Share Documents on 
Acrobat.com. You’ll need to send an email invitation to the recipients and let them know 
they must download the shared file, make comments, and submit the comments to you.
 Integrating comments. You have two methods for adding comments from recipients to 
your files in a PDF Portfolio. You can use the Comments ➪ Import Comments command 
or use Comments ➪ Migrate Comments. In either case you need to open each PDF docu-
ment individually by clicking the Preview button or double-click a file in the PDF Portfolio 
interface. When the file opens in Preview mode, you must click the Open button to open 
the file in a new window. You need to do this for both your master file and a PDF 
Portfolio that has been returned to you. When both files appear in a new window, you 
have access to all the Comments menu commands.
CROSS-REF

For more information on PDF Portfolios, see Chapter 12. For more information on 
sharing files on Acrobat.com, see Chapter 29.
As you can see from the list of the things you need to do to merge comments from reviewers into 
a PDF Portfolio, the task of sending out files for individual reviews provides you the best solution 
for reviewing the content for each document. When using shared reviews, you have all the tools 
needed to migrate comments, track the comment reviews, and send reminder notices quite easily.
If you need an overall review of the look and feel of a PDF Portfolio, you can merge all edited files 
in a PDF Portfolio after completing individual review sessions and gather comments on the shared 
portfolio using several manual steps listed here.
Summary
 You can initiate email and shared reviews in Acrobat and participate in reviews in any 
Acrobat viewer. Following steps in a wizard automatically prepares a file with Adobe 
Reader usage rights so Adobe Reader users can participate in review sessions.
 The Tracker lists all documents initiated from Attach for Email Reviews and Send for 
Shared Review.

 You can host shared reviews using network folders, SharePoint servers, Web servers, and 
Acrobat.com. When it comes to server configuration, Acrobat.com is the easiest method 
for sharing reviews on servers.
 When files are enabled with Adobe Reader usage rights, the Adobe Reader users can 
participate in ad-hoc review workflows.
 Migrating comments is used for moving comments from a review in progress to an 
updated version of the reviewed document that might have been modified during the 
review cycle.
 PDF Portfolios cannot be handled in shared reviews. In order to comment and review 
on PDF Portfolios, you must follow several steps to create a workaround for distributing 
files and migrating comments.

O
ne of the truly great features Adobe Acrobat offers is the ability to 
create interactive documents containing hot links that invoke many 
different actions. Acrobat provides you with many tools and meth-
ods for making your PDFs come alive, and Acrobat helps you refine docu-
ments for user navigation and interactivity. Regardless of whether you post 
PDFs on Web servers, communicate via email, replicate CD-ROMs, or work 
with documents on local network servers, Acrobat offers tools and features 
that help you create dynamic documents.
In this chapter, you learn how to create links with a variety of Acrobat tools, 
and you learn some of the differences between several methods for linking 
views. With hypertext links originating from various elements such as book-
marks, page actions, links, and destinations, you have a number of action 
tools that provide you with an almost limitless opportunity for handling 
views and relationships between documents. This chapter covers creating 
hot links and all the different actions you can associate with links.
Setting Up the Links and 
Actions Environment
Reset the toolbars (open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and select Reset 
Toolbars). Open the More Tools dialog box (open a context menu on the Toolbar 
Well and select More Tools) and scroll down to the Advanced Editing 
Toolbar. Select all tools and select the Advanced Editing Toolbar check box. 
Move down to the File Toolbar and check the box for the Organizer. Scroll 
to the Page Display toolbar and select the tools you want to use for page dis-
plays. If you want the Navigation tools accessible, check the Page Navigation

toolbar. Scroll to the Select & Zoom toolbar and select the Actual Size, Fit Width, and Fit Page 
tools.
Click OK to open the toolbars not loaded by default. Another toolbar that can be helpful when cre-
ating links and buttons is the Properties Bar. Open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and select 
Properties Bar. Return to the context menu and select Dock All Toolbars. When finished, your 
Acrobat application window should look like Figure 22.1.

Working with Bookmarks
If you use programs that support exporting to PDF with structure, you can add bookmarks auto-
matically at the time PDF files are created. Programs such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, 
Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Visio, Autodesk AutoCAD, Adobe PageMaker, Adobe InDesign, 
Adobe FrameMaker, and QuarkXPress support bookmark creation from style sheets when you use 
export tools in the authoring programs. Ideally, in a workflow environment where these programs 
are used, it is advantageous to create bookmarks from authoring applications when permitted by the 
program and when the bookmark action relates to page views. In other programs, or when editing 
PDFs with bookmarks, you may need to reassign bookmark actions, order bookmarks in a hierarchy, 
or create additional bookmarks.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information regarding bookmark exports from authoring programs, see 
Chapters 8 and 9.
The most common bookmark action in Acrobat is navigating page views. Whereas analog book-
marks mark pages, the electronic bookmarks in a PDF document enable you to navigate to different 
pages and different zoom views. You can capture various page views and zoom in on images, text, 
tables, and so on in Acrobat as bookmark destinations. In a broader sense, you can use bookmarks 
to invoke actions such as opening/closing files, opening secondary files, executing menu commands, 
submitting forms, playing sounds and movies, executing JavaScripts, and a host of other related 
actions.
Creating bookmarks
As long as you understand the sequence of steps, creating bookmarks is easy. Creating a bookmark 
is like capturing a snapshot. The process involves navigating to the page and view you want to 

735
Creating Links and Actions
22
capture and then creating the bookmark. Therefore, if you want to capture page 13 of a document 
in a Fit Page view, you navigate to page 13, click on the Fit Page tool, and then create the bookmark.
You create bookmarks from several options. When the page view is in place, open the Options 
menu in the Bookmarks panel and select New Bookmark. You can also open a context menu on a 
page and select Add Bookmark from the menu options. In Figure 22.2 the Bookmark panel Options 
menu is shown.
 FIGURE 22.2
To create a bookmark, navigate to the desired page view and select New Bookmark from the Options pull-
down menu in the Bookmarks panel (left).
NOTE
NOTE
By default, the items Paste under Selected Bookmark and Paste after Selected 
Bookmark are grayed out. You need to select Cut from the menu options to make 
the two Paste commands active.
 
 Click on the Bookmarks panel to access the Options menu for bookmarks. Using a context menu, 
you can create a bookmark when the Navigation panel is collapsed. When you create a bookmark 
from a context menu while the panel is collapsed, the Navigation panel opens and the Bookmarks 
panel is placed in view.
If you open the Options menu in the Bookmarks panel, the menu options appear as shown in 
Figure 22.2. However, if you first select a bookmark and then open a context menu, the menu 
commands change to menu commands shown in Figure 22.3. As shown in Figure 22.3, you have 
fewer menu choices in the context menu than the Options menu.

736
PDF Interactivity
Part IV
 FIGURE 22.3
If you select a bookmark in the Bookmarks panel, the context menu is as shown here.
You can also use shortcut keys to create a bookmark when the Bookmarks panel is either opened or 
closed. Press Ctrl/Ô+B on your keyboard to create a bookmark. In all of these methods, a bookmark 
defaults to the name Untitled. Acrobat highlights the Untitled bookmark name after the bookmark is 
created. You type a name and press the Enter or Return key when you are finished typing.
On pages where text corresponds to names you want to use for bookmarks, Acrobat helps simplify 
the naming process. Click the Select tool and highlight the text you want to use as your bookmark 
name. From a context menu, select Add Bookmark. The bookmark is created and the highlighted 
text is used as the bookmark name. The stages of creating a bookmark in this manner are: 1) the page 
view is in place, 2) text is selected on the page and a context menu opened, 3) Add Bookmark is 
selected from the menu options (see Figure 22.4), and 4) the bookmark is created using the selected 
text for the bookmark name. You can also use the Options menu or modifier keys to create a book-
mark while text is selected.
 FIGURE 22.4
To automatically name a bookmark, select text with the Select tool and create the bookmark.

TIP
TIP
If you want to add a new bookmark in a list following a specific bookmark name, 
click the bookmark preceding the one you want to add. Leave the bookmark 
selected and navigate to the page and view for your new bookmark using the Navigation tools. 
Press Ctrl/Ô+B and the new Untitled bookmark is added below the selected bookmark in the 
Bookmarks panel.
Managing bookmarks
Bookmarks created in a document appear in the Bookmarks panel in the order they are created, 
regardless of the page order. For example, if you create a bookmark on page 15, and then create 
another on page 12, the bookmarks are listed with page 15 before page 12 in the Bookmarks panel. 
At times you may want to have the Bookmarks list displayed according to page order. Additionally, 
bookmarks may appear more organized if they are nested in groups. If you have a category and a 
list of items to fit within that category, you may want to create a hierarchy that expands or collapses. 
Fortunately, Acrobat enables you to change the order of bookmarks without recreating them. 
Additionally, you can categorize the bookmarks into groups.
To reorder a bookmark, select either the page icon or bookmark name in the list and drag it up or 
down and left or right. A triangle with a dotted line appears when you drag a bookmark, as shown 
in Figure 22.5. To nest a child bookmark below a parent bookmark, drag straight up. The triangle 
and line show you the target area for the bookmark.
 FIGURE 22.5
The triangle indicates where a bookmark is to be reordered.
If you have a parent bookmark with several child bookmarks nested below it, you can move the 
parent to a new location. Drag the parent bookmark and all child bookmarks below it move with 
the parent. If you want to remove a child bookmark from a nest, click and drag the bookmark to the 
left and either down or up to the location desired.
In addition to moving bookmarks, you can cut and paste them. Select a parent or child bookmark, 
and from a context menu or the Bookmark panel Options menu, select Paste under Selected 
Bookmark or Paste after Selected Bookmark. When you choose Paste under Selected Bookmark the 
cut bookmark(s) is pasted as a child bookmark under the selected bookmark. Pasting after a selected 
bookmark pastes the cut bookmark(s) after the selected parent and all child bookmarks.

Copying and Pasting Bookmarks
W
ith all the great new features that have been continually added to Acrobat since version 6, the 
age-old fundamentals of bookmark copying and pasting that could have been implemented in 
Acrobat 1 are still not available in Acrobat 9. Considering the many new wonderful features added 
to Acrobat 9, it’s not much of a disadvantage for users to not have these features added in the newest 
release, but I know many users who frequently work with long documents and continually bookmark 
sections of PDF documents would like to see some options for copying and pasting bookmarks.
There are some third-party developers who do offer solutions for adding more functionality to man-
aging bookmarks. If bookmarking documents is a routine task you perform in Acrobat, you may 
want to search for some third-party tools to help you out. If you’re an occasional bookmarker, then 
perhaps a workaround just might be helpful.
Assume you have several documents and in each of your PDF files you want to create a bookmark 
action to open files. You have the same files to open and close from within each separate document. 
Do you need to manually create bookmarks in each file? Not necessarily.
To begin a workaround for not having a copying and pasting bookmarks feature in Acrobat, create 
all the bookmark actions you want for opening files in a master file. You might have a document 
used as a contents page that links to other files via bookmarks. All the necessary bookmark actions 
designed to open secondary files would be part of this document.
Verify all your bookmark actions work properly and save the file. Next, choose Document ➪ Replace 
Pages and choose one of the linked files to replace all pages in your master file. If your secondary 
document has more pages, use the Document ➪ Insert Pages command. You can always delete old 
pages without disturbing bookmarks assigned to open files.

739
Creating Links and Actions
22
Multiple nesting is also available with bookmark organization. A bookmark can be subordinate to 
another bookmark that is itself nested under a parent bookmark. To subordinate a bookmark under 
a child bookmark, use the same method as described previously for creating the first order of chil-
dren. As you drag right and up slightly, you can nest bookmarks at several levels.
You can also relocate multiple bookmarks at one time. To select several bookmarks, Shift+click each 
bookmark in a group. As you hold down the Shift key, you can add more bookmarks to the selec-
tion. If you click one bookmark at the top or bottom of a list and Shift+click, all bookmarks between 
are selected. For a noncontiguous selection, Ctrl/Ô+click. Once selected, drag the bookmarks to a 
new location in the list. Their order remains the same as it was before the move.
By default, new bookmarks appear at the end of a bookmark list. If you want to place a bookmark 
within a series of bookmarks, select the bookmark you want the new bookmark to follow. When 
you select New Bookmark from the Bookmarks Options menu, from a context menu, or press Ctrl/
Ô+B, the new bookmark is created at the same level after the one you selected.

Renaming bookmarks
If you create a bookmark and want to change the bookmark name, select the bookmark to be edited 
from the Bookmarks panel. From the Options menu, select Rename. Acrobat highlights the name 
in the Bookmarks panel. Type a new name and press the Return or Enter key on your keyboard to 
finish editing the bookmark name. You can also click the cursor anywhere in the Document pane 
to finish editing the name.
You can rename bookmarks by clicking on a bookmark name and clicking again on the book-
mark. You can also use a context menu, but be certain you first select the bookmark; then open 
a context menu to select the menu option for Rename. When you click on a bookmark, you go to 
the associated bookmark view. Clicking a second time informs Acrobat you want to edit the name. 
To select the text, click and drag across the part of the name you want to edit or press Ctrl/Ô+A 
to select all text. When you type a new name, the selected text is deleted and replaced with the 
new text you type.
Structured bookmarks
Structured bookmarks retain document structure in files generated from tagged PDF files. You 
can use structured bookmarks to navigate PDF pages, reorganize the pages, and delete pages. If 
you create PDFs without tags, you can add structure to a document by choosing Advanced ➪ 
Accessibility ➪ Add Tags to Document. After you have a structured document and you create 
bookmarks, more options are available to you. For example, you can delete and extract pages via 
structured bookmarks.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on creating tags and working with structured documents, see 
Chapter 25.
Depending on whether you have a bookmark or a structured bookmark, context menu commands 
and the Options menu commands appear differently. When you open a context menu from a stan-
dard bookmark, the menu commands appear as shown in Figure 22.3. When you open a context 
menu from a structured bookmark, the menu commands are as they appear in Figure 22.6. Notice 
the items that relate to Delete Pages and Extract pages that are available when you open a context 
menu from a structured bookmark.
When you create a bookmark, the destination for the bookmark is a link to a page view. In the 
context menu for standard bookmarks, you see the menu command for Set Destination. You can 
navigate to a new page and select this command to change the bookmark link to a new view. With 
structured bookmarks, you capture the page structure (a page view, a table, a head, and so on). In 
the context menu, be certain to select Delete and not Delete Page(s) if you want to delete a book-
mark. The Delete command deletes just the bookmark. Delete Page(s) deletes the bookmark and 
the page associated with the bookmark.

 FIGURE 22.6
These menu commands are available when you open a structured bookmark context menu.
Bookmark appearances
Both bookmarks and structured bookmarks contain menu options for Use Current Appearance as 
New Default. This menu choice is like a bookmark style sheet where you first select the appearance 
of the bookmark in terms of font style and color; then you select this menu option to set the attri-
butes as a new default. For example, change the bookmark to small text, italicized, in red; then open 
a context menu and select Use Current Appearance as New Default. All subsequent bookmarks 
you create use the same style until you change the default.
The Wrap Long Bookmarks option from either menu creates a word wrap for the bookmark name 
in the Bookmarks panel. By default Bookmarks are wrapped. If you want more Bookmarks to 
appear in the vertical list, you can unwrap them. An unwrapped Bookmark appears as you see in 
Figure 22.7. When the cursor is placed over a Bookmark, a tooltip displays the entire bookmark 
name. When the Bookmark is wrapped, it appears as you see in Figure 22.8.
 FIGURE 22.7
When a Bookmark name is longer than the panel width, a tooltip shows the complete name extended 
beyond the panel width.

 FIGURE 22.8
When Wrap Long Bookmarks is selected in a Bookmarks context menu, bookmark names are wrapped to 
the panel width and shown in multiple lines of text. This display appears by default.
If you open the Options menu, you have more choices for how the bookmarks appear in the panel. 
In Figures 22.7 and 22.8, bookmarks are expanded. The minus (–) symbol (a down-pointing arrow 
on Macintosh) shows all nested child bookmarks below it. Click on the symbol and the bookmark 
collapses to hide all child bookmarks below the parent. If you want to show all top-level bookmarks 
expanded, select Expand Top-Level bookmarks from the Options pull-down menu. To collapse the 
bookmark list, select Collapse Top-Level bookmarks from the same menu. The latter menu com-
mand is dynamic and is accessible only in the menu if you have first expanded bookmarks.
Select Hide After Use from the Options menu if you want to hide the Bookmarks panel after you 
select a bookmark. To change text sizes, make selections from the Options pull-down menu. Select 
Size and choose from one of the three submenu items for Small, Medium, or Large point sizes.
Adding special characters to bookmark names
Acrobat doesn’t offer much in terms of changing fonts and font attributes for bookmark names. 
However, you are not limited to the default font used for bookmarks; and, when you need some 
special characters or foreign language text for a bookmark name, you can garner a little help from 
your operating system.
On Windows, open the Character Map. This file is located by clicking the Start Menu and choos-
ing Programs ➪ Accessories ➪ System Tools ➪ Character Map. The Character Map program opens 
as shown in Figure 22.9.
From the Font pull-down menu, choose a font. Be certain to use fonts with Unicode character 
equivalents. Not all fonts and not all characters within a font will work. You need to look around 
for those fonts having a Unicode character set. For starters, try to pick some of the Adobe OpenType 
Pro fonts when you want to add special characters to your bookmark names.
Click a character in the scrollable window and click Select. The character is added to the Characters 
to copy text box. You can add several characters to the text box. When finished, click Copy and the 
character(s) is copied to the Clipboard. Open the Bookmarks panel and create a new bookmark, or 
edit a bookmark name and choose Edit ➪ Paste. The character(s) is pasted into a bookmark name. 
In Figure 22.10 I created several bookmarks using nonstandard characters.

On the Macintosh, you’ll find a menu command in the Edit menu used for a similar purpose. Open 
the Edit menu and choose Special Characters (Macintosh only). The Characters window opens as 
shown in Figure 22.11. To insert a special character on the Mac, place the cursor inside a book-
mark name and double-click a character in the Characters window. Alternately, you can also click 
a character and click the Insert button in the Characters window.

Bookmark properties
The Options pull-down menu offers you choices for text sizes. For other text attribute changes 
you need to use the Bookmark Properties dialog box. Select Properties from a context menu and 
the Bookmark Properties dialog box shown in Figure 22.12 opens.

You select type styles from the Style pull-down menu. Select from Plain, Bold, Italic, or Bold_Italic. 
Clicking the Color swatch opens the color pop-up window where you select preset colors or cus-
tom colors. You can capture changes from these style options when you select the Use Current 
Appearance as New Default menu command previously discussed.
The Actions tab enables you to change bookmark actions. By default, the bookmark action is set to 
open a view within the active PDF document. You can assign many other actions to bookmarks in 
the Actions properties.

For assigning bookmark actions, see the section “Working with the Link Tool” later 
in this chapter.
Using the Properties Bar
The Properties Bar also offers options for appearance settings. (Remember, we loaded that toolbar 
when we set up our editing environment at the beginning of the chapter.) Using the Properties Bar 
is a trade-off. On the one hand, it’s so much easier to make changes to bookmark appearances using 
the toolbar; but on the other hand, it takes up a row in the Toolbar Well. If your monitor is large 
enough and your viewing space adequate to comfortably see page content, then take a look at the 
options you have in the Properties Bar shown in Figure 22.13.
 FIGURE 22.13
Select a bookmark and the Properties Bar reflects options for editing bookmark appearances.
When you select a bookmark, options in the Properties Bar include the following:
 Color. Click the Color down arrow and the color palette opens where you can assign a 
preset color or a custom color to a bookmark name.
 Text. Click Plain and a pull-down menu opens displaying font attribute choices.
 More. Click the More button and you get a quick launch of the Properties dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 22.12.
All in all, the Properties Bar is helpful when you need to make bookmark appearance and property 
changes. If the Toolbar Well isn’t too crowded, keep this toolbar open when you make edits for 
bookmarks and other types of link options.

Setting bookmark opening views
If you create bookmarks in a document and want the document to open with the Bookmarks panel 
open, you can save the PDF document in a manner where the Bookmarks panel opens in the 
Navigation panel each time the PDF is opened.
Choose File ➪ Properties or press Ctrl/Ô+D to open the Document Properties dialog box. Click the 
Initial View tab. From the Navigation panel pull-down menu, select Bookmarks Panel and Page, as 
shown in Figure 22.14. Save the file after making the properties change. The next time you open 
the document, the Bookmarks panel opens.
 FIGURE 22.14
Choose Bookmarks Panel and Page from the Navigation panel pull-down menu.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on setting Initial Views, see Chapter 5.
The width of the Bookmarks panel is a user default specific to Acrobat on the end user’s computer 
and not the file you distribute. If you open the Bookmarks panel to a wider view than the default, 
each time you open a PDF with the bookmarks in view, the Bookmarks panel is opened at the width 
you last adjusted. If you save the file with the Initial View showing Bookmarks and pages, Acrobat 
does not take into consideration your Bookmarks panel width. Other users who open your files 
see the Bookmarks panel sized to their personal panel width default sizes. This default is made 
from the last time you adjusted the panel size.
Working with Articles
Acrobat offers a feature to link text blocks together for easy navigation through columns of text. 
User-specified ranges of text can be linked together, thereby forming an article. Articles help a user 
navigate through a PDF file, enabling the user to read logical sequences of paragraphs throughout 
a document. Working with articles is particularly helpful when you view PDF files on the World 
Wide Web. PDF files can be downloaded a page at a time in a Web browser. If you have a column 
or group of paragraphs of text that begins on page 1 and continues on page 54, an article thread 
can assist a reader in jumping from page 1 to page 54 without his or her having to download the 
remaining pages in the document.

Viewing and navigating articles
You need to know a few basics on navigating through an article in a PDF.
 
 To determine whether articles exist, choose View ➪ Navigation Panels ➪ Articles. A panel 
 opens with tabs for Articles. You can dock the panel in the Navigation pane by dragging the 
Article tab to the pane as shown in Figure 22.15.
 FIGURE 22.15
Drag the Articles tab to the Navigation pane to dock the panel.
 
 The Articles panel displays any articles existing in the PDF file in the panel list. If you select the 
Article tool from the Advanced Editing toolbar, the article definition boundaries are shown. In 
Figure 22.16, the Article tool is selected. The defined article is contained within a rectangular box 
with an identifier at the top of the box. In this example, 1-1 indicates that this is article number 1 
and box number 1. If the article is continued on another page, the subsequent boxes read 1-2, 1-3, 
1-4, and so on, indicating they are continuations of the same article thread. If you create a second 
article, the article begins with numbers 2-1, indicating the second article in the document and the 
first box of the second article.
Article properties
The article properties are contained in a dialog box that opens immediately after you create an arti-
cle or double-click an article with the Article tool. The Properties dialog box shown in Figure 22.17 
is informational. When you view Article Properties, information supplied at the time the article was 
created is displayed for four data fields. The Title, Subject, Author, and Keywords fields are the 
same as those found in the Document Information dialog box. Inasmuch as the data for these fields 
are identical to that found in document information, Acrobat Search does not take advantage of the 
article properties information. Properties are designed to help you find information about an article 
before you jump to the page where the article is contained. All the fields are editable when you 
open the Article Properties dialog box.

Viewing articles
Articles are viewed at the maximum view established in the Preferences dialog box. When you 
view an article, you select the Hand tool and click an article thread. The screen view jumps to the 
maximum view assigned in the Page Display Preferences. By default, the zoom is set to an 800% view 
or a view that accommodates the complete width of a column of text. In most situations this view is 
much larger than needed for comfortable viewing. In earlier versions of Acrobat you could choose 
Edit ➪ Preferences and click General in the left panel. From the Max Fit Visible Zoom pull-down 
menu select a zoom view comfortable for reading on your monitor. However, this preference set-
ting was removed in Acrobat 8 viewers and you no longer have control over zoom levels when 
reading articles.
In order to read articles you need to have a preference option enabled in the General preferences 
dialog box. Open Preferences (Ctrl/Ô+K) and click General in the left pane. Check Make Hand 
tool read articles in the right pane. If the check box is disabled, the Hand tool won’t recognize 
articles.
Alternately, you can open the Articles panel by choosing View ➪ Navigation Panels ➪ Articles. The 
Articles panel can remain open as an individual panel, or you can drag it to the Navigation pane 
and dock it. The panel pull-down menu in the Articles panel offers only one option. If you select 
Hide After Use from the panel pull-down menu, the panel disappears when you view an article. If 
you want to have the panel remain open, but want more viewing area in the document, dock the 
Articles panel in the Navigation panel.
Double-click an article to jump to the first view in the thread. When you double-click an article in 
the Article panel, the article jumps in view in the document pane and the Article pane displays an 
arrow adjacent to the selected article in the Articles panel. In Figure 22.15 you see the arrow in view 
in the first article. The change in the icon appearance in the Articles pane keeps you informed of 
what article is currently being viewed.
Acrobat places the top-left corner where the article begins in view when you double-click an article 
name in the Articles pane or choose Read Article from the Articles pane Options menu. You imme-
diately see a right-pointing arrow blink on the left side of the first line of text. Once an article is in 
view, select the Hand tool and position the cursor over the article (be certain the General preferences 
are set up to read articles with the Hand tool). The cursor changes to a Hand tool icon with an 
arrow pointing down. As you read articles, the cursor changes according to the direction Acrobat 
takes you when you’re reading an article. For example, if you’re viewing a column up instead of 
down, the cursor changes to inform you which direction you’re going. The different cursor views 
are shown in Figure 22.18.
 FIGURE 22.18
When you view articles, different cursors inform you ahead of time the direction you need to navigate.

Part IV
You can use several keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate with the Article tool. The cursor changes 
according to the following modifier keys:
 Click. The first click zooms to a zoom level up to 800%. If you read columns of text, you 
may find the zoom level lower, such as 200%. Click the cursor again to continue reading 
down a column. Click at the end of an article box, and the view takes you to the beginning 
of the next column.
 Shift+click. Moves backward or up a column.
 Ctrl+click or Option+click. Moves to the beginning of the article.
 Return or Enter. Moves forward down the column or to the top of the next column.
 Shift+Return or Shift+Enter. Moves up or to the previous column.
Defining articles
You define articles by drawing rectangular boxes around the text you want to include as part of your 
article thread. While you’re using the Article tool, the rectangular boxes are visible. When the tool 
is not active, the rectangular boxes are invisible.
Click and drag open a rectangle surrounding the column where you want to begin a new article. 
When you release the mouse button, the rectangular box displays on the page. At each corner and 
side of the article box are handles that you can grab and move to reshape the box. Notice that the 
lower-right corner of the article box contains a plus (+) symbol. When you finish your edits, dese-
lect the Article tool to exit edit mode. You can return to edit mode and add more columns after 
reselecting the Article tool. Click the aforementioned plus symbol to let Acrobat know you want to 
extend the article thread (see the later section “Combining articles” for more on extended article 
threads).
TIP
TIP
You can create article threads at the time the PDF file is either exported or distilled 
with Acrobat Distiller. Many layout applications support creating articles prior to 
exporting to PDF. In some cases, you may want to have a single article thread to help user navi-
gation through your document. To practice, identify an article in one of the programs discussed 
in Chapter 7 and then export to PDF either through the program’s export feature or by printing 
to PostScript and later distilling in Acrobat Distiller.
Ending an article thread
When you reach the end of the article, Acrobat needs to know you want to finish creating the 
thread. To end an article thread, press Return, Enter, or Esc. Acrobat prompts you with a dialog 
box in which you supply the Title, Subject, Author, and Keywords fields for the article properties. 
This dialog box appears immediately after you define an article. Supplying the information at the 
time the dialog box opens is a good idea because then you won’t need to worry about returning to 
the Article Properties dialog box for last-minute cleanup.

Deleting articles
You might want to delete a portion of an article thread or an entire article. To delete either, select 
the Article tool and click an article box. Press the Backspace (Delete) key on your keyboard or open 
a context menu and select Delete from the menu options. A dialog box opens providing options for 
deleting the currently selected box or the entire article. To delete the entire article from within the 
Article panel, select the article and click the Trashcan icon, or open a context menu and select 
Delete.
If you select the Box button in the Article dialog box, the deletion eliminates the article box within 
the article thread you selected when you pressed the Backspace (Delete) key on the keyboard. 
Clicking the Article button deletes all boxes in the thread across all pages in the document.
Combining articles
At times you may want to join two articles to create a single article. To join two articles, you must 
first have them defined in the PDF document. Move to the last column of the first article and click 
the plus symbol in the last box. This click loads the Article tool. Next, move to the beginning of the 
article to be joined to the first article and Ctrl+click or Option+click inside the first box. While you 
press the shortcut keys, the cursor icon changes, as illustrated in Figure 22.19.
 FIGURE 22.19
When you press the Ctrl or Option key while clicking the mouse button, the cursor changes to an icon, 
informing you that the selected articles are to be joined.
The numbering at the top of each box in the second article changes after the articles are joined. 
For example, if you have two articles, the first numbered 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, and the second article 
numbered 2-1, 2-2, the new numbering for the second article changes to 1-4 and 1-5. Article 2 
takes on the attributes of article 1 and assumes the next order of the article boxes. In addition, the 
properties identified in the second article are lost. Because the continuation of the thread is from 
article 1, all attributes for article 1 supersede those of article 2. You can select multiple articles and 
join them all together in a single article by following the same steps.
TIP
TIP
When combining two articles, always start with the article containing the attributes 
to be retained. For example, in the preceding case, to retain the attributes of arti-
cle 2, select the plus symbol at the end of the last column in article 2 and click. Ctrl+click or 
Option+click in the first box for article 1. When the two articles are combined, the attributes of 
article 2 are retained.

Working with the Link Tool
Links are no mystery to any user who has browsed the Web. Buttons and text that open other Web 
pages and invoke various actions are something that’s commonplace to any computer user. With 
Adobe Acrobat Standard, Pro, and Pro Extended, you have many tools to create hypertext links that 
ultimately appear very similar to the kinds of links you find on Web pages.
 
 You use the Link tool to create links from a rectangle drawn with the tool to other pages, other 
 documents, and a host of other link actions you can define in the Link Properties dialog box. 
The area within a link rectangle is the hot spot for invoking a link action. Links used with tools 
such as Bookmarks and Form Field buttons have the same attribute choices for the actions associ-
ated with the objects created with the respective tools.
TIP
TIP
You can also create a link without drawing a rectangle when you want a link to 
appear from text on a page. Use the Select tool and drag across some text to select 
it. From a context menu, select Create Link. A rectangle is automatically created for you around 
the selected text. You then target the link destination and the link action is created.
When creating links with the Link tool, you encounter two dialog boxes used to establish link 
actions. For link actions used in opening a view, opening a secondary document, or opening a 
Web page, the action choices are contained in the Create Link dialog box, which opens when you 
click and drag open a link rectangle and release the mouse button. If you want to assign different 
link actions, you create a custom link and make attribute choices in the Link Properties dialog box. 
The Create Link dialog box requires you to make all option choices in the dialog box before you 
can access any commands in the Document pane. The dialog box is static, which means you need 
to cancel out of the dialog box or click OK to use menus, shortcut keys, or select objects on a page 
in the Document pane. When you work with the Link Properties dialog box you can access tools 
and menu commands, and select items such as buttons and other links on pages while the dialog 
box remains open.
Creating links for page navigation
To help you understand how to use the Link tool, it might be helpful to walk through some steps 
first before you go on to read over all the attribute choices you have for links. To follow the steps 
that follow, you should have two documents. In one document you’ll create a link to another file, 
and in the other document you’ll create a link to a specific page in another file. To see how all this 
comes about, try following these steps.
STEPS: Creating links to page views
 
1. Open a file in Acrobat. For these steps you should have two documents. The first docu-
ment should be a multiple-page file.
 
2. Navigate to a page other than the opening page. Use the Next Page tool or press the 
Page Down key on your keyboard to open a second page in the document. If you want to 
open another page, press Next Page or Page Down to scroll pages. Find a page other than 
the opening page. In my example, I start on page 2.

753
Creating Links and Actions
22
 
3. Create a link. Select the Link tool in the Advanced Editing toolbar and draw a rectangle 
with the tool in the area you want the link to appear. You should have text or an icon on 
the page that makes it intuitive for a user to know a link exists: a graphic, blue text, or 
some other indication that clicking in an area will invoke an action much like you might 
see on a Web page.
 
4. Identify the link attributes. When you click the link tool and draw a link rectangle, the 
Create Link dialog box opens. Click Open a file and click Next. The steps are shown in 
Figure 22.20.
 
5. Select a file to open. The Select File to Open dialog box appears after clicking Next in 
the Create Link dialog box. Navigate your hard drive and locate the file you want associ-
ated with the link. Click Select in the Select File to Open dialog box.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
You should copy all PDFs that are linked to the same folder. If you create links to 
files scattered on your hard drive and then relocate the files, Acrobat will lose the 
link destinations. When copying files to the same folder, you can relocate your folder on your 
hard drive, network server, or CD-ROM without disturbing the link destinations.

6. Set the Open Preferences. After identifying a file to open, the Specify Open Preference 
dialog box (formerly known as Window Preferences in versions prior to Acrobat 8) 
appears. Click Existing Window, as shown in Figure 22.21. Making this choice opens 
your target link while the file containing the link closes.
 FIGURE 22.21
Select Existing window to open a file. The current open document closes in the Document 
pane as the new file opens.
 
7. Save the file. Select File ➪ Save or click the Save tool in the File toolbar to save your edits. 
Because this file will close when the new file opens, you need to be certain your edits are 
saved.
 
8. Open the linked file. Select the Hand tool and click the link. The target file should open 
in the Document pane.
 
9. Create a second link. Select the Link tool and draw a link rectangle. Select Go to a page 
view in the Create Link dialog box. Click Next to open the Create Go to View dialog box.
 
10. Select the target page to open. While the Create Go to View dialog box (shown in 
Figure 22.22) is open, you have complete access to all the tools and menu commands in 
Acrobat. Just leave the dialog box in view and click the Open tool or select File ➪ Open. 
Locate the file you added a link to in Step 1 and open it. Navigate to the page containing 
your original link by clicking the Next Page tool or the Page Down key on your keyboard. 
When the page is in view at the zoom level you want, click Set Link.
 FIGURE 22.22
Open the target page and click Set Link.

11. Save your edits. When you click Set Link, you are returned to the page from which the 
link originated (your second file in this example). Click the Save tool or select File ➪ Save 
to save your edits.
 
12. Test the links. Close all documents and open the file containing the first link. Click the 
link and the second file opens. Click the link on that page and the first file opens, but this 
time the page that opens should be a page other than the first page in your document.
Note that you created two different links in these steps. The first link used the Create Link dialog 
box and you opened a file. When the file was opened you arrived at the default view on the first page 
in the file. The second link opened a page other than the opening page (in my example it was page 2). 
To link to specific document pages in secondary files you need to use the Go to a page view option 
and set the link in the Create Go to View dialog box.
The steps outlined here are but a fraction of the many different attribute choices you have for cre-
ating links and choosing actions. A host of other actions are available to you when you create cus-
tom links. Read on to find out more about creating different kinds of links.
Linking to views
In the Create Link dialog box (opened when you draw a link rectangle with the Link tool) you 
make one of four radio button selections. The first three radio buttons enable you to specify link 
attributes in the Create Link dialog box shown back in Figure 22.20. If you select the fourth radio 
button and click OK, the Link Properties dialog box opens where you select different actions for 
the link behavior.
The first three radio button choices offer you options for selecting a page view or a file to open. 
Options shown in the Create Link dialog box include the following:
 Go to a page view. Use this option to link to a page in the open document or create a 
cross-document link that opens a page in another document. When you click the Next 
button, the Create Go to View dialog box opens as shown earlier in Figure 22.22. While 
the dialog box remains open, you have access to menu commands and tools. Navigate to 
a page in the open document or click the Open tool, open a second file, navigate to the 
desired page, and click Set Link.
 Open a file. Select this option if you want to open a PDF document or any file from 
another authoring program. When you click the Next button, the Select File to Open 
dialog box opens and allows you to select any file on your system. If you select a file 
other than files that can be opened in Acrobat, you (or your customer) must have the 
native authoring program installed in order to click on the link and open the file. If you 
select a PDF document, you link to the Initial View in the secondary document.

a URL, be certain to supply the complete Web address, including http://www. After you 
add a URL, the address becomes a new default. Each time you create a new link, the last 
URL added to the Edit URL field box is inherited and appears in the field box.
 Custom Link. Custom Link in and of itself contains no properties. You select this radio 
button if you want to set a different action for a link. If you select Custom Link and click 
OK, the Link Properties dialog box opens.
TIP
TIP
URLs in text on PDF pages don’t require links. Acrobat versions 7 and above are 
intelligent and they interpret URLs created in authoring programs from text with 
either http://www. or www. prefixes as URLs. When you place the Hand tool over URL text in a 
document, the Hand tool shows an icon with a Hand and a W inside the Hand indicating a live 
Web link. Click the link and your default Web browser opens the linked page. For earlier versions 
of Acrobat having URLs in text, you need to create URL links in the PDF files. Note that end users 
must have the option Create links from URLs enabled in the General preferences in order for 
Acrobat to recognize URLs from text.

Editing a link action
If you create a link using any one of the first three radio buttons in the Create Link dialog box and 
later want to edit the link, you are not returned to the Create Link dialog box. The Create Link dia-
log box opens only after you first use the Link tool to create a link.
To change a link action, use either the Link tool or the Select Object tool. Double-click the mouse 
button with either tool to open the Link Properties. If you select the Hand tool and click on a link, 
the link action is employed.
Link appearance properties
The link appearance applies to the rectangle drawn when you drag the Link tool on a page in the 
Document pane. Default appearances are established from the last appearance settings made for 
the link properties. To change properties, you have two choices. You can use the Properties Bar 
(described in “Setting Up the Links and Actions Environment” at the beginning of this chapter) 
or the Link Properties dialog box.
When using the Properties Bar, you make changes to link appearances for the items contained 
across the bar, as shown in Figure 22.23.

 FIGURE 22.23
Select a link with the Link tool or the Select Object tool to enable the options in the Properties Bar.
The choices in the Properties Bar include the following:
 Color. The Color pop-up window opens when you click on the square at the far left side 
of the Properties Bar. Choices for color apply to strokes only and the options are the same 
as you find when changing colors in Note properties.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on changing Note properties, see Chapter 20.
 Line Style. You have choices from the pull-down menu for No Line, Solid, Dashed, and 
Underline. No lines might be used when you have a graphic image or text on a page and 
a link is apparent to a user. For example, if text appears blue and underlined, you might 
use No Line for the line style.
 Line Thickness. The default shown in Figure 22.23 is 1 pt. You have choices for Thin, 
Medium, or Thick that translate to 1 point, 2 points, or 3 points, respectively. The line 
weight you choose appears in the Properties Bar. If you select No Line in the Line Style 
menu, 0 pt is listed in the Properties Bar.
 Highlight Style. Use this option to display highlights when the mouse button is pressed. 
When you select the Hand tool and click on a link, the highlight is shown within the link 
rectangle while the mouse button is pressed. You can choose from No Highlight, Invert, 
Outline, and Inset.
 More. Clicking the More button opens the Link Properties dialog box just as a context 
menu command does.
Note that when you click the Link tool in the Advanced Editing toolbar and before you create or 
select a link, the Properties Bar becomes active. You can make choices for Color, Line Style, Line 
Thickness, and Highlight Style. But the More button is not active unless you select a link. When 
you click the Link tool before selecting a link and make appearance changes, the changes become 
a new default and will remain as a default until you change them again. If you quit Acrobat and 
relaunch the program, the default changes you made are still honored.
Link properties
To open the Link Properties dialog box, you can open a context menu and select Properties; double-
click on a link with the Link tool or the Select Object tool; select a link and press the Enter or Return 
key; or, with a link selected, click the More button in the Properties Bar. A right-click in Windows 
or Ctrl+click on Macintosh opens a context menu where you can select Properties to open the Link 
Properties dialog box.

PDF Interactivity
Part IV
When the Link Properties dialog box opens, you have options nested in two tabs: the Appearance 
tab and the Actions tab. By default, the Appearance tab is placed in view, as shown in Figure 22.24.
 FIGURE 22.24
Two tabs exist in the Link Properties dialog box where you select appearance and actions options.
The same options offered in the Properties Bar for appearance settings are available in the Appearance 
tab with the addition of the Link Type and a check box for Locked. Link Type is a choice you have 
in the Create a Link dialog box as well as here in the Link Properties. Choose from Visible Rectangle 
or Invisible Rectangle to make the link rectangle visible or hidden.
If you enable Locked, the link rectangle is locked to position on the document page and cannot be 
moved; however, when you select the Hand tool and click on a locked link, the action associated 
with the link still executes. Locking a link also disables all option choices in the Properties Bar and 
the Link Properties dialog box for that link. If you need to change properties for a locked link, 
open the Appearance tab and disable Locked.
Link actions properties
Click on the Actions tab to assign an action to a link. The default link action is Execute a menu 
item (the top item in the Actions list). Open the Select Action pull-down menu and you find a 
scrollable list of Action types, as shown in Figure 22.25. After you create a link with another action 
type, the new action becomes the default.
The Select Action pull-down menu offers a number of actions you can assign to a link. You can 
select an action and repeat a selection for a different action to nest action types that are executed in 
the order displayed in the Actions window. In Figure 22.26, three separate actions are associated 
with the same link. When you click the link with the Hand tool, a page opens, a Web link opens 
that launches your default Web browser, and a menu item is executed to quit Acrobat.

Part IV
From the pull-down menu, you can choose action types such as the following.
Go to a 3D View
If you have a PDF containing a 3D drawing, you can create links and buttons to open different views 
in the drawing such as wireframe, shading, and various other views. The Add this action option 
opens the Select a 3D View dialog box where the views are selected.
Go to a page view
You add the action and the Create Go to View dialog box opens. Navigate to a page in an open 
document or a secondary document and click Set Link.
You can also link to pages in secondary documents using the Go to a page view in the Link Properties 
dialog box.
Execute a menu item
All versions of Acrobat prior to Acrobat 8 provided options for executing almost all the menu com-
mands you see from the top-level menus.
Now in Acrobat 9, instead of using pull-down menus in a Menu Item dialog box, the Menu Item 
dialog box opens where you select from a list organized by menus with more limited commands. A 
number of different menu commands were eliminated from the Execute a Menu Item action begin-
ning with Acrobat 8, including several items that relate to changing PDF content such as adding 
bookmarks; creating page templates; adding headers, footers, watermarks, and backgrounds; add-
ing comments and markups; and using Forms menu commands. The Advanced menu commands 
have also been eliminated.
Adobe’s reasoning for this is that it’s answering user demand for the capability to protect files against 
document changes that an end user may not be aware of. For example, if you create a button that cre-
ates a bookmark or comment, adds a form field, and so on, the end user may not be aware that the 
button action altered the document. You are now just limited to executing a selected set of menu 
commands, as shown in Figure 22.27.
Import form data
When you select the Import form data option and click Add, the Select File Containing Form Data 
dialog box opens. Select the file containing the form data you want to import and click the Select 
button. Imported form data is from files saved in FDF (Form Data File) or XML format that are 
exported from PDF documents. When you click the Select button, the data matching identical 
form fields is imported. Using Import form data limits you to importing data saved only in FDF 
format. If you use the Forms ➪ Manage Form Data ➪ Import Data menu command, data can be 
imported when saved as FDF, XFDF, XML, FormFlow99 Data Files(.xfd), and TXT. Note that you 
must have at least one form field on the page for this to work.

actions to play, stop, rewind, pause, mute, set volume, and add custom JavaScripts.
In order to use this action, you must have a multimedia file either converted to PDF or imported in 
a PDF document. When you add the action the Multimedia Operations dialog box opens as shown 
in Figure 22.28.

Open a file
You use Open a file to open any file on your computer. When you select the action type and click 
the Add button, the Open dialog box opens. Browse your hard drive and select the file you want to 
open. If the file is not a PDF file, you (or your customer) need to have the authoring application that 
created the file installed on your computer in order to execute the link action. Creating the link does 
not require you to have any external programs installed on your computer.
Open a web link
The Open a web link option enables you to associate a link action to a Web address. Web links can 
be contained in PDF documents locally on your computer or within a PDF page where the PDF is 
hosted on a Web server. If a Web link is contained locally in a PDF document, selecting the link 
launches the browser configured with Acrobat and establishes a URL connection. Acrobat remains 
open in the background while the Web browser appears in the foreground. Always use the com-
plete URL to identify a Web address.
When you specify a URL in the Edit URL dialog box that opens after you click the Add button in 
the Link Properties, you can add custom viewing in the URL address for the way you want to open 
a PDF document. For example, if you want to view a page other than the opening page you can 
add to the URL a request for opening any page number. To open a specific page, enter: 
http://www.mycompany.com/myDoc.pdf#page=3

763
Creating Links and Actions
22
In this example the file myDoc.pdf opens on page 3 in the Web browser. In addition to opening a 
specific page, you can add other viewing parameters such as zoom levels, page modes such as view-
ing layers or bookmarks, named destinations, and so on.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on setting viewing options with Web links, see Chapter 27.
Play a sound
You can create a link or button to play a sound in a PDF document. When you select the Play a 
sound action and click the Add button, the Select Sound File dialog box opens for you to locate 
a sound file on your hard drive and import the sound. Acrobat pauses a moment while the sound 
is converted to a format usable in Acrobat viewers. After it’s imported in the PDF, the sound can 
be played across platforms. When the link button is selected, the sound plays. Sounds imported 
with the Play a sound action and those added with the Record Audio Comment tool support only 
Acrobat 5 media. If you use the Sound tool you can choose to import either Acrobat 5– or Acrobat 
6–compatible sounds.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For importing sounds with the Sound Attach tool, see Chapter 12. For information 
on using Acrobat 5– and Acrobat 6–compatible sound and media, see Chapter 23.
Notice the Multimedia task button pull-down menu contains a Sound Tool. You can use the Sound 
tool to import sounds. In addition, you can use the Record Audio Comment tool to import sound 
files. Playing sounds from any of these tools is identical. The Sound tool and the Record Audio 
Comment tool are limited to adding sounds on a page where a user needs to click or double-click a 
button to play the sound. The link action is more versatile as you can add sounds with nested link 
actions, page actions, and form fields. Sound files are supported from files saved as AIFF or WAV.

Play media (Acrobat 5 compatible) & Play media 
(Acrobat 6 and Later Compatible)
Acrobat 9 has an entirely new way to handle multimedia than previous versions of Acrobat. The 
Play Media (Acrobat 5 Compatible) and Play Media (Acrobat 6 and Later Compatible) actions are 
used with legacy files where play buttons were added in Acrobat 8 and earlier. These actions are 
not used in Acrobat 9 when importing media using the Multimedia tools. The alternative to creat-
ing play buttons in Acrobat 9 is to use the Multimedia Operation (Acrobat 9 and later) action.
If you have legacy files with media clips and play buttons earlier than Acrobat 9, you can edit the 
play actions by opening a link or button properties and edit the properties in the Play Media 
(Acrobat 5 or 6) compatible dialog boxes as shown in Figure 22.29.

Read an article
When you select Read an article as the action type for a link, the Select Article dialog box opens 
when you click the Add button. If no articles are present in the PDF document, you receive a 
dialog box alerting you that there are no articles present and you can’t use this link action. When 
articles are present, select the article you want to associate with the link from the listed articles in 
the Select Article dialog box. When you select the link in the navigation mode, Acrobat opens the 
page where the first box in the article appears. Additionally, the cursor changes to the Article icon 
that enables you to continue reading the selected article.
Reset a form
The Reset a form link action relates to PDF documents with form fields. When a form is filled out, 
you can reset the form to remove all data contained in the form fields. Acrobat provides an oppor-
tunity to clear the data from all fields or from selected fields you identify individually. A Reset a 
form dialog box opens, enabling you to select the fields to clear.

For more information on resetting forms, see Chapter 34.
Run a JavaScript
JavaScript adds great opportunity for making PDF documents interactive and dynamic. You can 
add JavaScripts to link button actions as well as form fields. When you select Run a JavaScript and 
click the Add button, the JavaScript Editor dialog box opens. You type the code in the dialog box, or 
copy and paste code from a text editor to the JavaScript Editor. Click OK to commit the JavaScript.

Set layer visibility
For PDF documents containing layers, you first create the layer view you want in the Layers panel.
 
 Open the Layers panel and show the layers you want displayed when a user clicks on the link. In 
Figure 22.30, four layers are hidden, as shown in the Layers panel. When you use the Set layer vis-
ibility action type, the layer view at the time you create the link is what is shown to the user when 
he or she clicks the link. This behavior works similarly to bookmarks in which you place in view 
in the Document panel your resultant view, and then create the bookmark. Layer visibility works 
the same. Set the visibility you want, and then set the link.
 FIGURE 22.30
When using the Set layer visibility action type, you first show the layer view you want to display to assign 
it to the link action.
After setting your layer view for the display when the user clicks the link, create a link and click 
the Custom Link button. Select Set layer visibility from the Actions pull-down menu and a dialog 
box opens, informing you the current layer state has been captured.

The Show/hide a field action enables the user to allow selected form fields to be visible or hidden. 
Forms can be created to display and hide form fields for help menus and informational items, to 
protect data, and so on. You can make a hidden field visible by opening the Show/Hide Field dia-
log box and selecting the Hide radio button. Within this dialog box the options for both hiding 
and showing fields are enabled through radio buttons.

Submit a form
Form and comment data contained in PDF documents can be transported on the World Wide Web. 
When a user completes a form, the data can be submitted to a URL as a Form Data File (FDF), 
HTML, or XML data. Additionally, the entire PDF can be submitted. The PDF author can then col-
lect and process the data. Using form and comment data with Web servers has some requirements 
you need to work out with the ISP hosting your Web site. If you use forms on PDF Web pages, 
include a button that submits data after the user completes the form. Using the Submit a form 
action enables you to identify the URL where the data is submitted and determine which data type 
is exported from the PDF document. If comment data is to be submitted, a check box enabling 
comment delivery appears in the dialog box.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
New in Acrobat 9, you can submit form data without a button. Acrobat 9 provides 
users the option for submitting form data to Acrobat.com without the need to con-
figure Web servers and without a need for creating submit buttons. To learn more about data 
handling with the new Acrobat 9 features, see Chapter 35.
Managing links
Acrobat provides many menu options for link management. You can copy/paste, align, and dis-
tribute links and more through the use of a context menu. If you need to apply these editing tasks 
to multiple links, select the Select Object tool and click and drag through the links you want to 
manage.
After selecting multiple links with either the Select Object tool or Link tool, open a context menu 
as shown in Figure 22.31. The context menu offers several menu categories with submenu items 
used for managing links.
 FIGURE 22.31
Select multiple links with the Link tool or the Select Object tool and open a context menu. Select a menu 
category and select the command you want to use from the submenu items.
The menu items include the following:
 Edit. The Edit menu contains several items in a submenu for cut/copy/paste, accessible in 
the top-level Edit menu. You can delete a link or group of links by selecting Delete.
 Select All. Select All deserves some special comment. When you select a link with the 
Link tool or choose Edit ➪ Select All, all links are selected on a page. If you click on a link 

767
Creating Links and Actions
22
with the Select Object tool and choose Select All from the Edit submenu, all objects 
selectable with the Select Object tool are selected on the page. For example, if you have 
links and form fields, Select All selects all links and form fields on the target page. If you 
want to edit the links for deletion, alignment, copying, and so on, be certain to click on 
the Link tool and then use Edit ➪ Select All.
 Align. You can align multiple links Left, Right, Top, Bottom, and along the vertical and 
horizontal centers. Choose the respective submenu command for the alignment option of 
your choice.
 Distribute. If you have a row or column of links and you want to position them equidis-
tant from each other, choose the Distribute command and select from either Vertically or 
Horizontally. Vertically distributes a column and Horizontally distributes a row of link 
objects.
 Size. As you create link rectangles, you may draw the links at different sizes. To resize 
links on a given page to the same size, select one of the links with the Link tool. Using a 
context menu, click Select All, move the Link tool to the target size link rectangle, and 
open a context menu. (The target link rectangle is displayed with a red keyline and red 
handles while the other rectangles in the selected group are highlighted blue.) Select from 
the submenu Height, Width, or Both. The selected link rectangles are resized to the size 
of the target link.
 Properties. Use this option to open the Link Properties dialog box. If you select more than 
one link rectangle, the link actions shows Varies in the action list if the link actions are 
different among other selected links. You can apply common appearance settings to all 
selected links or you can edit actions if the actions are all the same among the selected links.
TIP
TIP
If you want to change appearances for multiple links or button fields, use the Select 
All menu command to select all the objects, or drag through a group of objects with 
the Select Object tool and edit the object attributes in the Properties Bar. You can change the 
color of borders (and fills on button fields), line thickness, and highlight style for multiple objects.
Working with Page Properties
A page action is like a link button that invokes an action when a page is opened or closed in the 
Document pane. You don’t have to click on anything because the trigger for executing the action 
type is handled by Acrobat when the page opens or closes. All the action types available with links 
are the same actions that are associated with page actions.
To create a page action, open the Pages panel. Select a page with the Hand tool and open a context 
menu. From the menu options select Page Properties. The Page Properties dialog box opens with 
two sets of properties types available. The default page properties options are contained in the panel 
for Tab Order, but these settings don’t have anything to do with setting a page action, so I’ll skip 
them for the moment.

It is the second tab in the Page Properties dialog box that is used for setting page actions. Click on 
the Actions tab shown in Figure 22.32, and the options for defining actions to page behavior are 
displayed. Two areas are used for applying a page action to any page in a PDF document. You first 
select the trigger for either Page Open or Page Close and then select the action from the Select 
Action pull-down menu. The options in this menu are the same as you have available with link 
actions.
 FIGURE 22.32
Open the Page Properties dialog box from a context menu on a page thumbnail. Click the Actions tab to

Page actions help you make your PDF documents more automated. You might select a sound to 
play when a page opens, as shown in Figure 22.32. You may want to set layer visibility, play a movie, 
or execute a menu item. Of all the options available for action types, with page actions you have 
the addition of an infinite number of choices when running JavaScripts. You might want to run a 
script that analyzes the Acrobat viewer version when a user opens a PDF document and alerts the 
user that Acrobat 6 is needed to properly view your document if the user opens the file in a viewer 
version earlier than Acrobat 6. This example and many more options are available to you when 
running JavaScripts from page actions.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
To see examples of JavaScripts that analyze Acrobat viewer versions and viewer 
types, see Chapter 36 (on the CD-ROM).
Creating Destinations
A destination is a specific location in a document. Whereas a bookmark and a link may link to 
page 5 in a file, a destination links to the location where page 5 resides. If you delete page 5, book-
marks and links have no place to go and the links are often referred to as dead links. If you delete 
page 5 where a destination has been created, the destination remains at the same location — that 
is, following page 4 and preceding page 6. Furthermore, if you insert a page after page 4, the book-
marks and links are linked to page 6. All pages shift to make room for a new page, but the links 
from bookmarks and links remain fixed on a specific page. With destinations, if you insert a page 
after page 4, the destination takes you to the new page 5.

769
Creating Links and Actions
22
You can also use destinations when you want to use JavaScripts for creating pop-up menus and 
smart forms, and for adding other interactive features.
It all sounds pretty nifty but there’s a downside to using named destinations. Adding many desti-
nations in a PDF document adds a lot of overhead to the file size. Destinations can make a PDF 
bulky and slow if they are used extensively. Destinations should not be thought of as a substitute 
for bookmarks and links, but rather, a complement for creating interactive documents when other 
methods don’t support the same features.
Destination tools
 
 You create, organize, and display destinations within the Destinations panel. To open the panel, 
choose View ➪ Navigation Panels ➪ Destinations. If you want to use the Destinations panel fre-
quently in an Acrobat session, you can drag the panel into the Navigation pane. As a panel in the 
Navigation pane it is visible and easily accessible until you remove it by dragging it out of the pane.
The panel contains a few icons and a pull-down menu, as shown in Figure 22.33. In addition to 
the panel tools, context menus offer several menu options. You create, edit, and manage all desti-
nations through this panel.
 FIGURE 22.33
Open the Destinations panel by choosing View ➪ Navigation Panels ➪ Destinations. Several icons and a 
list of destinations appear in the panel.
The options are as follows:
 New. Click the New icon or a context menu option to create new destinations. You cre-
ate a destination by first navigating to the page and view, and then creating the destina-
tion, much like you create bookmarks.
 Delete. You can use the Trashcan icon in the panel, as well as a menu command avail-
able when opening a context menu on a selected destination to delete the destination.

 Sort by Name. Open the Options pull-down menu and select Sort by Name. Destinations 
are sorted alphabetically by name. Alternately, you can click on Name or Page in the 
Destinations panel title bar and sort by Name or Page.
 Sort by Page. Open the Options pull-down menu and select Sort by Page. Destinations 
are sorted by page number.
 Go to Destination. Open a context menu on a destination and select Go to Destination. 
When you invoke the command, Acrobat opens the destination page.
 Set Destination. Also from a context menu opened in the Destinations panel, Set 
Destination can reassign a new target destination. First navigate to a new view, and then 
select Set Destination.
 Rename. From a context menu opened on a destination name, select Rename. The name 
becomes highlighted and ready for you to type text for a new name.
Creating a pop-up menu
You can use destinations to create a pop-up menu on a page that displays menu options for navi-
gating to other pages and other files. To create a pop-up menu that links to other pages, you create 
destinations and then add some JavaScript to a link or button field. When a user selects a menu 
item, the page destination opens in the Document pane.
Follow these steps to experience how easy it is to create an application pop-up menu.
STEPS: Creating application pop-up menus
 
1. Open the Destinations panel. Open a PDF file with multiple pages. Select View ➪ 
Navigation Panels ➪ Destinations.
 
2. Create destinations. Navigate to each page and set the view using the Zoom tools. Click 
New in the Destinations panel for each page view you want to capture. As you create new 
destinations, type a name for each destination in the Destinations panel. In my example, I 
created five destinations, as you can see in Figure 22.34.
 FIGURE 22.34
After you add destinations, the Destinations panel displays the names you used when 
creating each new destination. The destinations are sorted by name in the list. To sort 
the list by page number, select Sort by Page from the Options pull-down menu.

3. Create the JavaScript. After you have finished adding new destinations, you need to do 
a little programming. If you haven’t used the JavaScript Editor, don’t panic. These steps 
are no more complicated than following a few simple directions.
CROSS-REF

For a better understanding of using JavaScript and the script created here, see 
Chapter 36 (on the CD-ROM).
 
 Select the Link tool and click and drag open a link rectangle. Ideally, it’s best to have some 
text or an icon on the page indicating that a button or link is present. If you don’t use 
button faces and icons, you can also simply use a keyline border to show where the link 
appears on the page. In the Create Link dialog box, select Custom link and click OK. The 
Link Properties dialog box opens. Click Actions and from the Select Action pull-down 
menu, select Run a JavaScript.
 
 Click Add and the JavaScript Editor opens. In the JavaScript Editor, type the following 
code:
1. var c = app.popUpMenu
2. ([“Blogs”, “Thom”, “Ted”]
3. [“User Groups”, “Chapters”],
4. [“Forms”, “Claim Forms”]);
5. this.gotoNamedDest(c);
 
 See the sidebar “Analyzing the Script” later in this chapter for a detailed explanation of 
the code. In my example, the code appears as you see in Figure 22.35.

Manufacturing, and so on. The items listed in the code (item1, item2, and so on) would be the 
destination names. You might use something like Accounting Policies, Accounting Procedures, 
HR Polices, HR Procedures, and so on, as the destination names.
 
4. Exit the JavaScript Editor and Link Properties. Click OK in the JavaScript Editor and 
click OK in the Link Properties dialog box.
 
5. Test the pop-up menu. Select the Hand tool and click the link. You should see a 
pop-up menu similar to Figure 22.36. In this example, I included two items in the first 
category to appear in a submenu. In Figure 22.36, User Groups and Forms are labels. 
The submenus open Chapters and ClaimForm items that are the destinations.
 FIGURE 22.36
If the pop-up menu was created properly, you should see submenu items listed when 
selecting a category.
Analyzing the Script
I
n the script, the first line of code sets a variable c for a pop-up menu. Regardless of what your 
destinations are named or the contents of your PDF, copy this line of code into your JavaScript 
Editor exactly as you see it.
Lines 2 to 4 contain the categories and submenu commands that link to the destinations you created. 
Here’s where you need to modify your code. Where you see “category x,” replace the name with a 
category title of your choosing. You might want to use names such as Personnel, Administration, and 
Finance, or you can use category names such as Designs, Illustrations, and Photos, or any other com-
bination of names that relate to the categories you want to use. Notice that line 2 begins with an open 
parenthesis, (, followed by a left bracket, [. These characters are important to include in your code.
In lines 2 through 4 are three item numbers contained in quotes and separated by commas. These 
names need to be the same as your destination names. Type the destination names exactly, including 
letter case, as you created them in your Destinations panel. The order in which you add the names 
is unimportant. Also notice that after the last destination name and quote mark, no comma is 
inserted. Lines 2 and 3 end with a comma and line 4 ends with a semicolon. It is also important to 
type these characters just as you see them in the sample code.
Line 5, the final line of code, is the instruction to take the user to the destination selected from the 
menu options. Type this line exactly as you see it into your JavaScript Editor.

To modify JavaScript code, select the Link tool and double-click the link. In the Link 
Properties dialog box select the item denoted as Run a JavaScript in the Actions list 
and click the Edit button. The JavaScript edit dialog box opens where you can make changes to 
the code.
In this example, destinations are used to navigate pages in a PDF document via a pop-up menu. If 
the design of your PDF documents better suits pop-up menus, you have many options when using 
JavaScripts. You can also create pop-up menus with JavaScripts that open other PDF documents or 
specific pages in other PDF documents and that execute many different menu commands.

For an example of a pop-up menu that opens secondary PDF documents, see 
Chapter 36 (on the CD-ROM).
Working with Buttons
In the previous section you saw how to use the Link tool to navigate pages and open files. When 
links are created, you need some kind of icon or text that lets a user know that a link button exists. 
If you add links on a page in empty white space with no border keyline, users won’t know where 
or when to click on a link button. If you want to use images or icons for button appearances, you 
can use another form of link tool with the Button tool that supports importing icons.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
Prior to Acrobat 9, the button tool and other form field objects were limited to 
Acrobat Professional and Acrobat 3D. In version 9, you find the button tool and all 
other form tools available in Acrobat Standard (Windows), Acrobat Pro (Windows and Macintosh), 
and Acrobat ProExtended (Windows).
Creating a button field
Using form fields instead of links has some advantages. You can add image icons to button fields, 
use rollover effects, and copy and paste fields across multiple pages, and you have all the same 
action types accessible as those used with bookmarks, links, and page actions.

The discussion of button fields in this chapter is limited to creating button fields 
with actions similar to those discussed in this chapter when creating link actions.

Editing toolbar in Viewer mode. From the Add New Field menu in Form Editing Mode choose 
Button and click the tool on a document page. An abbreviated Properties window opens where 
you can edit the default name for the field. Click Properties and the Button Properties dialog box 
opens showing the General tab.

774

Part IV
If you don’t change the name when you create a button, Acrobat automatically names the field for 
you beginning with Button1, then Button2 for the next button you create, then Button3, and so on. 
When you open the Properties dialog box you can additionally change the field name in the General 
tab. Highlight the default name and type a new name. In this example, I want to create some navi-
gation buttons. The name of the button I’ll use is goNext, as shown in Figure 22.37.
 FIGURE 22.37
Type a name for the button field in the General tab.
Button faces are handled in the Options tab. Click the Options tab and select Icon Only from the 
Layout pull-down menu. Click the Choose Icon button and the Select Icon dialog box opens. From 
this dialog box you need to access yet another dialog box by clicking the Browse button. The Open 
dialog box opens to a view where you can navigate your hard drive and select a file to import as your 
button face. Any file format compatible with the Create PDF from File tool is acceptable. Select a 
filename in the Open dialog box and click Select. Acrobat returns you to the Select Icon dialog box 
where you can see a preview of the imported file, as shown in Figure 22.38.
If the preview looks like the file you want to use as a button face, click OK to return to the Button 
Properties dialog box. Click the Actions tab where you assign the action type associated with your 
button. In this dialog box you make a choice for the trigger action. The default is Mouse Up, which 
means when the mouse button is released the action executes. Leave the Select Trigger menu option 
at the default and open the Select Action pull-down menu.
Select Execute a menu item from the pull-down menu. Click the Add button and the Menu Item 
dialog box opens. Select View ➪ Go To ➪ Next Page, as shown in Figure 22.39.

Now repeat the preceding steps to create a second navigation button for moving to previous pages 
and using a different icon to represent moving backward in the PDF file.
To move a button field, select either the Button tool or the Select Object tool. In the example here, 
two buttons are created to provide navigation back and forth between pages as shown in Figure 
22.40. If you want to move the two buttons together, you need to use the Select Object tool. Drag 
the buttons to an area on the page where you can easily click the buttons to navigate pages.

Duplicating buttons
At this point, the obvious advantage of using a button field over a link is when you want an image 
or icon appearance used with the button. Another advantage for using button fields over links is the 
ability to duplicate button fields across pages. The hard part is finished after you create the fields 
and add the button faces. The next step is to duplicate buttons so you don’t have to copy/paste 
them on each page.
With the button fields in place, select the Select Object tool and click and drag through both fields. 
Be certain to click and drag outside the first field so as not to select it while dragging. When both 
fields are selected, open a context menu and select Duplicate, as shown in Figure 22.41.
 FIGURE 22.41
Open a context menu on selected buttons and choose Duplicate.
When you release the mouse button, the Duplicate field dialog box opens as shown in Figure 22.42. 
In the dialog box, select the page range for the duplicated fields. If you created fields on the first 
page, enter 2 in the first field box and enter the last page number in the second field box. Click OK 
and the fields with the same field properties are duplicated across the specified pages.

 FIGURE 22.42
Enter the page range in the Duplicate Field dialog box and click OK. The fields are duplicated on the 
pages you specified.
Click the buttons to navigate pages. Notice that each button appears in the same relative position 
on each page.
The important thing to remember as you work with bookmarks, links, page actions, destinations, 
and fields is that each is designed for different purposes. Although you can create the same results 
with one method or another, at times you’ll favor one method over the others for a particular edit-
ing assignment. Acrobat offers many tools and features for creating dynamic interactive documents, 
often limited only by your imagination. The more time you invest in learning all that Acrobat affords 
you, the more impressive results you’ll produce.
Summary
 You can name, organize, and create bookmarks with different appearance properties. You 
can move, reassign, and delete standard bookmarks without affecting page content. When 
you delete structured bookmarks, the respective pages are deleted.
 Bookmarks support the same actions you can apply to links. Actions enable you to view 
pages, open documents, create Web links, and write JavaScripts and other types of com-
mands that act as hypertext links.
 Article threads enable viewers to follow passages of text in a logical reading order.
 Links support many different actions from page navigation to running JavaScripts. Links 
can be copied and pasted and the link properties are retained in the pasted objects. Links 
cannot be duplicated across PDF pages, and links do not support content files with colors 
or images.
 Acrobat supports opening user-defined pages in external PDF documents via link actions.
 You select link properties in the Create Link dialog box, from a context menu command, or 
by double-clicking on a link. All link actions are changed in the Link Properties dialog box.
 You make links from text by selecting text with the Select tool and choosing Create Link 
from a context menu.

778

 All the actions assigned to links can also be assigned to page actions. Page actions are 
established in the Page Properties dialog box accessed by opening a context menu on a 
page thumbnail and selecting Properties.
 Page actions are invoked when a page opens or a page closes.
 Destinations are similar to bookmarks. Destinations do not support actions. Destinations 
tend to make file sizes larger than when using bookmarks and links.
 You can use destinations, together with a JavaScript, to create pop-up menus.
 You can assign form field buttons different button faces from external files.
 Form fields are supported in Acrobat Standard (Windows), Acrobat Pro (Windows and 
Macintosh), and Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows).
 Form fields can be duplicated across multiple pages. Duplicated fields are placed on all 
pages in the same relative position as from where they were duplicated.

A
crobat offers a wide range of possibilities with animation, motion, 
and sound. You can import sound files in PDFs, import movie files, 
import and convert Flash files to PDF, convert Web pages with 
Flash animation, convert PowerPoint files with motion objects using Adobe 
Presenter, and create animation by writing JavaScript routines. With the 
exception of writing JavaScripts, you create animation and sound in other 
applications and import them in PDF documents or you can convert a media 
file directly to PDF.
Movie files added with the Video tool and sounds added with the Sound 
tool are available only in Acrobat Pro and Acrobat Pro Extended. Acrobat 
Standard does not have these tools and you have no way of adjusting proper-
ties for movie and sound files with Acrobat Standard. However, after you’ve 
added movie and sound files in Acrobat Pro or Pro Extended, all Acrobat 
viewers, including Adobe Reader, can play the movies and sounds.
In this chapter you learn how to import multimedia files into PDF documents, 
set a number of import options choices, import 3D files, adjust media prop-
erties, and convert media files directly to PDFs.
Setting Up the Multimedia 
Environment
You import sound and video files with the Video, Flash, or Sound tools and 
import 3D files with the 3D tool. All the tools are available from the new 
Acrobat 9 Multimedia toolbar. To open the toolbar, either select Tools ➪

bar. When the toolbar opens, right-click to open a context menu from the Toolbar Well and select 
Dock Toolbars. Additionally, you can select all tools from the Multimedia task button.
Working with Sound Files
You import sounds in Acrobat in one of two ways. You can use the Record Audio Comment tool 
and record or import a message in the form of a comment. Once recorded, the sound is embedded 
in Acrobat and not accessible for importing via an action. The other method of handling sound in 
PDF documents is to import sounds from files saved on your hard drive. By importing sounds you 
can invoke a sound with various action types — for example, using a page action to play a sound 
when the user opens or closes a page or clicks a button or link field.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on using the Record Audio Comment tool and setting action types, 
see Chapter 20. For more information on action types, see Chapter 22.
You import sound files with the Sound tool found on the Multimedia toolbar or by selecting the 
Sound tool from the Multimedia task button. Be certain to understand the difference between 
creating an audio comment and importing a sound with the Sound tool. Using the Record Audio 
Comment tool enables you to record a sound or import a sound file from your hard drive. Using 
the Sound tool enables you to import a sound from a file saved in a format compatible for import-
ing sounds, but does not offer you an option for recording a sound. Before you can use the Sound 
tool, you need to either acquire or edit sounds and save them to a file format Acrobat recognizes.
NOTE
NOTE
The Record Audio Comment tool is available in all Acrobat viewers including Adobe 
Reader when PDFs have been enabled with Adobe Reader usage rights. For more 
information on enabling PDFs with Adobe Reader usage rights, see Chapter 19.
Creating sound files
If you are so inclined you can purchase a commercial application for editing sound and saving 
recordings that Acrobat can recognize. If recording sounds is an infrequent task and does not war-
rant the purchase of expensive commercial software, you can find sound-recording applications as 
shareware and in the public domain that can satisfy almost any need you have for using sounds on 
PDF documents.
Web sites change frequently, so you may need to do a search for public domain and shareware 
applications for your computer platform. As of this writing you can find sound-editing programs 
at www.freewarefiles.com (Windows) or www.macupdate.com (Macintosh). You can find 
applications that enable you to record sounds and save them in formats acceptable to the platform 
you use that can then be recognized by Acrobat. The most common of the file types Acrobat recog-
nizes is WAV for Windows and AIFF for Macintosh.

781
Working with Multimedia and PDFs
23
NOTE
NOTE
You can import video and sound files that are compatible with Apple QuickTime, 
Flash Player, Windows Built-In Player, RealOne, and Windows Media Player. 
Windows media files need to be converted to QuickTime if you’re importing a Windows Media 
file on a Mac. Windows needs a QuickTime installation in order to import QuickTime files on 
Windows. Sound files saved as WAV and AIFF can be imported in Acrobat running on either 
platform.
Be certain you have a microphone properly connected to your computer according to your com-
puter’s user manual. Launch the sound-editing application you downloaded from a Web site or 
use a commercial application if you have one available. Most programs offer you a record button 
similar in appearance to a tape recorder or VCR. Click the Record button and speak into the micro-
phone. When finished recording, click the Stop button. Depending on the application, you may be 
prompted in a dialog box to save the file, or you may see a window where you can further edit the 
sound, as shown in Figure 23.1.
 FIGURE 23.1
To record sounds and save the sound to a file available for importing in Acrobat, use a sound-editing 
program.
If a dialog box does not prompt you to save the recording, select Save or Save As from a menu 
option. Typically the commands are under the File menu, but these may vary depending on the 
program you use. When you save the file, be certain to save in a format acceptable to Acrobat. A 
WAV (Windows) or AIFF (Macintosh) file format can be imported in Acrobat, but be careful of 
any file compression applied to the file when saved. You may need to test various compression 
options in order to find a format that Acrobat can recognize. After choosing the format, supply a 
name for the file with the proper extension, as shown in Figure 23.2.

After editing a sound, save the file in either AIFF (Macintosh) or WAV (Windows) format.
Adding sounds to page actions
A sound might be added to a Page Open or a Page Close action to provide informational instruc-
tions to complete a form, play a music score, or other similar function. In order to add a sound to 
a page action, you must have the sound file saved to disk as described in the preceding section. To 
add a sound to a page action, follow these steps:
NOTE
NOTE
Acrobat Standard does support importing sounds on page actions, bookmarks, and 
with links. Although you have no Sound tool in Acrobat Standard, you can use an 
action to import sounds.
STEPS: Adding sounds to page actions
 
1. Open the Page Properties. Be certain your sound file is available in a directory on your 
hard drive and click the Pages tab in the Navigation pane. From a context menu opened 
on the page where you want the sound to play, select Page Properties. The Page Properties 
dialog box opens.
 
2. Set the action trigger. Click the Actions tab and select either Page Open or Page Close 
from the Select Trigger pull-down menu.
 
3. Set the action type. Open the pull-down menu for Select Action and choose Play a 
sound from the menu options as shown in Figure 23.3.
NOTE
NOTE
By default, the Play a sound menu item in the Select Action pull-down menu may 
not be in view. Scroll the menu down to show the command.
 
4. Add the action to the page trigger. Click the Add button in the Page Properties dialog 
box to add the sound to your PDF.

 FIGURE 23.3
Choose Play a sound from the Select Action pull-down menu.
 
5. Select the sound file. The Select Sound File dialog box opens. Navigate your hard drive 
to find the sound to import, select it, and click the Select button. After importing the 
sound, click Close in the Page Properties dialog box.
NOTE
NOTE
Acrobat may pause momentarily. The sound file imported in Acrobat is converted 
during the import. When a sound is imported in a PDF file, the sound can then be 
played across platforms. Therefore, a WAV file can be played on a Macintosh computer and an 
AIFF file can be played on a Windows computer.
 
6. Save the file. Choose File ➪ Save As and rewrite the file to disk. Close the file and reopen 
it to test the page action.
After you save the PDF file and reopen it, the sound is played. You can also test the sound by scroll-
ing a page in the PDF file and returning to the page where the sound was imported. The action is 
dynamic and the sound plays before you save the PDF file.

Adding sounds to form field actions
Of the mouse behavior types, you may find that Mouse Enter, On Focus, or On Blur behaviors work 
equally as well as using a Mouse Up or Mouse Down trigger. As an example, you might have a 
descriptive message display when the user places the cursor over a button field and before he or she 
clicks the mouse. Or you may want to invoke a sound when the user tabs out of a field as a reminder 
to verify data entry in a PDF form. In these situations and similar uses, the sound is played from a 
mouse behavior related to a data or button field. To understand how to use sound actions with 
data fields, follow these steps:
STEPS: Adding sounds to form fields
 
1. Open a PDF document with form fields. In Figure 23.4, I use a form with several check 
boxes. I want to create a sound when the user places the cursor over one of the check boxes 
or tabs to the field.
 FIGURE 23.4
Four check boxes are to be configured to play a sound on a Mouse Enter trigger.
 
2. Open the field properties. Choose the Select Object tool in the Editing toolbar and 
double-click the field you want to edit. If no fields exist in your document, you need to 
enter Form Editing mode and add all but button fields in the Form Editing mode. If a 
field exists on a form, you can use the Select Object tool in Viewer mode. The Field Type 
Properties dialog box opens when you double-click a field with the Select Object tool.
CROSS-REF

For more information on creating form fields in Acrobat and using the Form Editing 
mode, see Chapter 34.
 
3. Select the mouse trigger. In the Check Box Properties dialog box, click the Actions tab 
and select Mouse Enter as the Select Trigger, as shown in Figure 23.5.

785
Working with Multimedia and PDFs
23
 FIGURE 23.5
Choose Mouse Enter from the Select Trigger pull-down menu.
 
4. Add a sound action to the field. Open the Select Action pull-down menu and select 
Play a sound.
 
5. Select the sound file. Click the Add button to open the Select Sound File dialog box. 
Select the file to import and click the Select button.
 
6. Close the Check Box Properties dialog box. Check to be certain the mouse trigger is 
set to Mouse Enter (or another trigger you chose to use). Click Close in the Check Box 
Properties dialog box.
 
7. Test the sound. Select the Hand tool and place the mouse cursor over the check box 
where you added the sound. (Note: To play the sound by tabbing to the field, use the 
On Focus mouse trigger.)
When the mouse enters one of the check boxes, the respective sound plays. The sound plays com-
pletely even if the cursor leaves the field. Sounds added to forms either for page actions or field 
actions can be played from any Acrobat viewer.
TIP
TIP
A sound continues to play to completion. If you want to stop the sound while edit-
ing a document, select the Select Object tool or press the R key on your keyboard 
to activate the Select Object tool. (Note: You need to enable Use single-key accelerators to 
access tools in the General Preferences to use key modifiers to select tools.)
Using the Sound tool
 
 Importing sounds with page actions, form fields, links, bookmarks, and so on limits your 
 import options to fewer file formats and limits the attributes you can assign to the imported 
file. In essence, you import the file and play the sound. Not much else is available when you use 
the Select Action command. Another method for importing sound files in PDF documents is 
with the Sound tool. When you use the Sound tool to import sounds, your options are much 
greater for the kinds of files you can import and attributes you can assign to the imported sounds.

786

Part IV
To import a sound with the Sound tool, select the tool from the Multimedia toolbar and just double-
click or drag open a rectangle on a document page. The area contained within the rectangle becomes 
a trigger to play the sound. When you release the mouse button, the Insert Sound dialog box opens, 
as shown in Figure 23.6.
TIP
TIP
You can manage sound and movie links similarly to links and form fields where 
context menu options enable you to size, align, copy, paste, and distribute fields. 
You can access these menu commands when you select sound and movie links in a group 
together with links and form fields. For more information on managing links and form fields, 
see Chapters 22 and 34.
 FIGURE 23.6
Double-click the Sound tool or click+drag on a document page to open the Insert Sound dialog box.
Click the Browse button and locate a file on your hard drive to import. Acrobat pauses a moment 
while the file is converted to a format that all Acrobat viewers recognize. If using Adobe Acrobat 
Pro Extended, the file is converted to Adobe Flash format.
You also have a link to open the Add Sound dialog box in the Insert Sound dialog box. Click the 
blue text where you see Create legacy multimedia content to open the Add Sound dialog box. The 
settings in this dialog box are the same as those you found in earlier Acrobat viewers. You have 
options for choosing Acrobat 6 (and Later) Compatible Media and Acrobat 5 (and Earlier) 
Compatible Media as shown in Figure 23.7.
If you use Acrobat Pro (Windows and Macintosh), you only have access to the legacy content set-
tings unless you use H.264 (MPEG-4 Part 10) compression. If you have Acrobat Pro Extended, 
you can import sound in the Insert Sound dialog box or click the Create legacy multimedia content 
link and use the Add Sound dialog box. If you don’t use the Add Sound dialog box and add 
sounds using the Insert Sound dialog box (only in Acrobat Pro Extended) shown in Figure 23.6, 
the sound is converted to Adobe Flash.

If using legacy files or preparing media for legacy viewers, you set the attributes for sound imports 
in the Add Sound dialog box. In the Add Sound dialog box, you have the following options:
NOTE
NOTE
Initial settings you apply to an imported sound are handled in the Add Sound dialog 
box for Acrobat Pro or Acrobat Pro Extended when you click the Create legacy 
multimedia content blue text. If you later want to edit the sound settings, the changes are made 
in either the Movie Properties (for Acrobat 5 or earlier compatible files) or the Multimedia 
Properties (for Acrobat 6 or later compatible files) dialog box. Either of these dialog boxes opens 
when you open a context menu on a sound rectangle using either the Sound tool or the Select 
Object tool and select the Properties command. The Multimedia Properties dialog box offers 
you many more settings options than the Add Sound dialog box. For more information on the 
Multimedia Properties options, see Acrobat 6 Multimedia Properties later in this chapter.
 Select new content’s compatibility. From the radio button choices you decide whether 
the sound import is Acrobat 6 (and Later) Compatible Media or Acrobat 5 (and Earlier) 
Compatible Media. If you select Acrobat 5 (and Earlier) Compatible Media, the format 
options are limited to WAV and AIFF formats. If you use Acrobat 6 (and Later) Compatible 
Media, the sound may not play with earlier Acrobat viewers depending on the file types 
you import and attributes assigned to the sound.
 Browse. By default, you identify the media in the Insert Sound dialog box. If you want to 
change the source file, click the Browse button in the Add Sound dialog box to locate a 
different sound you want to import.

 Content Type. By default, the type of the file you import is listed automatically in the 
field box. By clicking the down arrow you can open a pull-down menu where all compat-
ible file formats are listed. A total of 46 different file formats are supported. When you 
import files, let Acrobat interpret the file format and leave the format unchanged. If you 
select a sound for which Acrobat does not know the Content Type, Acrobat prompts you 
to click in a dialog box to select a content type.
 Embed content in document. Using Acrobat 5 compatibility automatically links a sound 
file to a PDF document. If you send your PDF to another user, you need to send the 
sound file along with the PDF document. Note that if you use an action to import a sound 
such as adding a sound to a bookmark action, the sound is always embedded in the PDF 
document. Furthermore, you don’t have a choice for compatibility.
 
If you use Acrobat 6 compatibility you can choose to link the sound file to the PDF or 
embed the sound in the PDF document. If you disable the check box for Embed content 
in document, you need to send the sound file as well as the PDF to a user in order for 
other users to play the sound.
 Poster Settings. If you select Acrobat 5 (and earlier), this option is not available. The 
rectangle you create appears similar to a button field. If you leave the default at Use no 
poster, then nothing appears inside the sound rectangle. If you select Create poster from 
file, you can fit a graphic to the rectangle — for example, something similar to using but-
ton faces for form field buttons. You click the Browse button to select the file you want to 
use for the poster. You can choose any file type that is compatible when using the Create 
PDF From File command. If the file type is other than PDF, Acrobat converts the file to 
PDF as it imports the image. If you’re using a multi-page PDF document for the poster, 
the first page in the PDF document is used for the poster.

For information on creating button faces, see Chapter 22.
Click OK after selecting options in the Add Sound dialog box. When you return to the document 
page, the rectangle is visible. You assign additional properties when you open the sound properties 
from a context menu. When the properties dialog box opens, the title of the dialog box is Multimedia 
Properties if Acrobat 6 (or Later) Compatible Media is selected and Movie Properties if Acrobat 5 
(or Earlier) Compatible Media is used.
Using advanced settings
The Insert Sound dialog box in Figure 23.6 shows you an abbreviated list of options choices you 
have when importing sound files. You can expand the dialog box by clicking the Show Advanced 
Options check box. When the Insert sound dialog box is expanded you find a number of addi-
tional choices you can make for importing sounds as shown in Figure 23.8.

The choices you have available for the advanced settings include:
 Enable When. Earlier in this chapter in the section “Adding sounds to page actions” I 
talked about importing sounds on page actions using Page Open and Page Close triggers. 
If you use the Sound tool and open the advanced settings, you can trigger a sound to 
play on opening and closing pages. From the Enable When pull-down menu, choose the 
default to play a sound when the sound media box is clicked, or choose one of the other 
two triggers in the menu that include The page containing the content is opened or The 
page containing the content is closed. These last two menu choices are the same as when 
you use Page Action triggers to play a sound.
 Disable When. You have the same choices from this menu as you have with the Enable 
When menu. You can choose to stop a sound from playing when making a choice from a 
context menu, when a page opens, or when a page closes.
 Playback Style. Two choices are available from the pull-down menu. The default is to play 
the content on the page, in which case you won’t see any visual changes on the page when 
the sound plays. The other choice is a floating window. A sound file does not actually 
appear in a floating window. A floating window is shown with a Flash file that acts like 
a placeholder. If you assign a poster to the sound object, the poster and sound object 
remain fixed on the page while a floating window like the one shown in Figure 23.9 opens.

 Width/Height. These text boxes are used to set the width and height of the floating window.
 Border Width. Choose from No border, Thin, Medium, and Thick.
 Transparent Background. Assigns the background to transparency.
 Poster Image. Your choices are: Keep current poster, where no change in the poster occurs; 
Retrieve poster from file, which doesn’t apply to sounds because sound files have no images 
in the file; and Create poster from file, where you can import any file consistent with the 
Create ➪ PDF From File menu command. The Browse button opens a dialog box where 
you select the file you want to use for a poster.
Most of the options you have available in the Insert Sound Advanced Settings are accessible in 
the Properties dialog box. You can initially insert a sound using the abbreviated settings shown 
in Figure 23.6 and later adjust properties as needed.
Acrobat 5–compatible Video (Sound) Properties
After you’ve imported a sound or video using the legacy content, you may want to adjust the 
properties. To open sound or video properties, use the Select Object tool and open a context 
menu. From the menu choices choose Properties. When you open properties on Acrobat 5 
Compatible Media, the Movie Properties dialog box opens as shown in Figure 23.10. The Movie 
Properties dialog box contains three tabs used for selecting more options than were available in 
the Add Sound dialog box.

When working with Acrobat 5 (and earlier) media, to open the Movie Properties dialog box, use the 3D 
tool, the Sound tool, the Flash tool, the Video tool, or the Select Object tool and select Properties from a 
context menu.
General properties
The default properties are the General Movie Properties. In this dialog box, you make the following 
selections:
 Title. By default, the title of the sound clip is the filename. Edit the title name in the field 
box to change the title.
 Media location. Local files are stored on your hard drive. You can change the sound to 
another file by clicking the Change Location button. Click the button to open the Select 
Multimedia File dialog box. Select another file and click the Select button to change the 
sound to another file. If you select URL, another dialog box opens asking you to specify 
a URL where a sound file is located. If importing sounds, you need to add the sound file-
name as part of the URL when using Acrobat 5 compatibility. When you deselect the 
option to embed the file with Acrobat 6 compatibility, the directory path is all you need 
to address in the line where the URL is specified.
Playback
The Playback tab offers options settings for playing sound clips and movies, as shown in Figure 23.11.

 FIGURE 23.11
Click the Playback tab to set options for playing sounds.
 Show player controls. If this check box is enabled, a control palette opens when a sound 
is played. In the control palette you have a button to play/pause and a slider. Click and 
drag the slider to move forward or backward in the sound file. In Figure 23.12, the sound 
rectangle appears without a poster. The Show player controls check box was checked in 
the Movie Properties dialog box and the player controls are shown after you click once 
inside the rectangle. At the top of the rectangle is the player control. The sound is cur-
rently stopped. Clicking the right-pointing arrow with the Hand tool continues the play.
 Use floating window. With sounds, the sound file is fixed to a location. With video clips 
you can select the Use floating window option to float a video clip in a window centered 
in the Acrobat window. If you select floating window for a sound file, the player control 
opens in a floating toolbar. In Figure 23.13, player controls are very similar to those 
shown in Figure 23.12. When Use floating window is added in the Playback tab in the 
Movie Properties dialog box, the player control appears as a floating window.
 FIGURE 23.12

Movie Properties Playback tab.
 FIGURE 23.13

One reason you might use a floating window with a sound file is if you place the sound 
rectangle on a page where you don’t want the rectangle visible to the end user — for 
example, something like a tiny rectangle in the top left corner of the page. If you add a 
page action to start the sound to play and you want the end user to stop or pause a sound, 
add the floating window. The window opens in the center of the page irrespective of 
where the sound rectangle is placed. The viewer of your PDF file can then pause, stop, 
and resume play.
 Size. For sound imports, the Size pull-down menu and field box are disabled. These 
options relate to sizing video clips, explained in the “Playback” section later in this chapter.
 Play. From the pull-down menu you can choose to play a sound Once; play a sound 
Once (keep player open); Loop, which loops through the sound and continues playing it 
over and over again; and play Forward and backward, which provides an interesting way 
of hearing your voice played backward. The latter option is best used for video clips 
without sound.
Appearance
Many of the options for appearance settings are the same as those found for link and form field 
appearances. Click the Appearance tab and make choices for the appearance of the rectangle bor-
der and the contents of the rectangle as shown in Figure 23.14.
 Type. From the Type pull-down menu select from Visible Rectangle or Invisible Rectangle. 
If Invisible Rectangle is selected, the following options for Width, Style, and Color are 
grayed out.
 Width. The same three choices for link and form field rectangle widths of Thin, Medium, 
and Thick are listed in the pull-down menu.
 Style. Two choices appear for either setting the rectangle to a solid line or a dashed line.
 Color. You can choose from the same color options you have available for links and form 
fields by clicking the color swatch and selecting either preset or custom colors.
 Option. The Option pull-down menu applies to video files. If you select Put in Document 
from the pull-down menu when using a sound file, the menu defaults back to Don’t Show. 
With sound files you cannot show a poster image because the sound contains no graphic 
data.
 Colors. The Colors pull-down menu and field box are disabled for sound files.
 Locked. The Locked check box is accessible from all tabs. When you select the Locked 
check box the sound rectangle is locked to position on the document page and the attri-
butes are locked. If you want to make any edits on the Movie Properties dialog box, you 
first need to uncheck the Locked item.

Acrobat 6–compatible Multimedia (Sound) Properties
If you elect to use Acrobat 6 compatibility, the options in the Add Sound dialog box are the same 
as discussed in the “Using the Sound tool” section earlier in this chapter. After you create a sound 
and import and select Properties from a context menu, a different set of property options appear in 
the Multimedia Properties dialog box. In Figure 23.15, the Multimedia Properties dialog box used 
with legacy files shows the default Settings tab options.
Settings
The Settings tab offers options for labels and renditions. By default the Settings tab is placed in 
view when you open the Multimedia Properties. As you can see in Figure 23.15, the Appearance 
tab is consistent with the Movie Properties dialog box, but the other two tabs (Settings and Actions) 
offer options much different from those found with Acrobat 5–compatible sound files. In the 
Settings tab you have options for the following:
 Annotation Title. Add a title for the sound in this field. The title supplied here can be 
different from the filename.
 Alternate Text. When creating accessible files for vision- and motion-challenged users, 
you can add alternate text that can be read by screen-reading software.
 Renditions. A good number of options available when editing renditions apply to video 
clips. For information on setting rendition options for sound files, see the section “Adding 
a rendition” later in this chapter.

Appearance
The Appearance tab (shown in Figure 23.16) in the Multimedia Properties dialog box offers options 
similar to those found in the Movie Properties for defining the attributes of a rectangle border for 
Type, Width, Style, and Color. In addition to these settings, other options include:
 Annotation is hidden from view. The annotation added to the field box in the Settings 
tab is visible by default. To hide the annotation, enable this check box.
 Change Poster Option. Options for the poster image are similar to those used with 
Acrobat 5–compatible files. The settings appear in a dialog box, shown in Figure 23.17. 
When you click the button for Change Poster Option, you find the following three options:
 Use no poster. This choice is the same as selecting Don’t Show in the Movie Properties 
dialog box. No poster is shown in the sound field.
 Retrieve poster from movie. Also a similar choice as you find in the Movie Properties 
dialog box. With sound files a dialog box opens informing you that no support for a 
poster is retrievable from sound files. For movie files the poster is retrieved from the 
first frame in the movie file.
 Create poster from file. The Movie Properties dialog box used with Acrobat 5–
compatible files offers you an option for Retrieve From Movie as the third choice in

the pull-down menu. This choice is the same as the preceding option and pulls the first 
frame in the movie clip as the poster image. With Acrobat 6 compatibility, the Create 
poster from file option enables you to use a PDF or file compatible with the Create PDF 
From File command as the poster image. To add a poster from a file, click the Browse 
button and select the file you want to import.

Actions
The Actions tab offers you options for setting an action on mouse triggers much like you apply 
actions to links, bookmarks, page actions, and form fields. Options from the Select Trigger pull-
down menu differ slightly from those you select for links, bookmarks, page actions, and form 
fields. The same triggers are available for video and sound files. Additionally, you have the same 
options for selecting an action, and you can manage actions such as changing the order, adding 
additional actions, deleting actions, and so on.
The options in the Actions tab include:
 Select Trigger. Open the pull-down menu to see the trigger actions like those shown in 
Figure 23.18.

page actions, links, and buttons where actions are applied.
 Page Visible. A current page active in the Document pane can be different than page 
visibility. When using Continuous page layout, Facing Pages, or Continuous – Facing 
Pages, you can have one page active while other pages are visible in the Document

pane. When this trigger is selected, the media clip plays dependent on page visibility 
and not necessarily the current page.
 Page Invisible. If a page is not visible in the Document pane, the media clip can be 
played on an action such as a button, link, or bookmark.
 Page Enter. This trigger is like setting a page action. When the page becomes the cur-
rent page, the media plays.
 Page Exit. The opposite of the preceding option. When you scroll to another page, 
the media clips play.
 Mouse Down. When the mouse button is pressed down, the trigger is invoked.
 Mouse Enter. When the mouse cursor enters the focus rectangle, the media clips play.
 Mouse Exit. Opposite of the preceding option where the sound or video plays when 
the mouse cursor exits the focus rectangle.
 On Receive Focus. This trigger is similar to the On Focus mouse trigger used with 
form field buttons. Pressing the Tab key activates the focus rectangle and the media 
clip plays.
 On Lose Focus. The opposite of the preceding option and like the On Blur mouse 
trigger where a media clip plays when you tab out of the field.
 Select Action. From the Select Action pull-down menu, you can select any action type 
that is also available to links, fields, bookmarks, and page actions. You might nest different 
actions and use the Select Action menu to add additional actions. For example, you might 
play different media clips with a single mouse trigger, play a media clip and then open a 
URL to display a Web page in your Web browser, change a layer view, or any number of 
other actions.

Importing Video Files
As with sound files, video files require that you create video clips in other authoring programs. No 
tools or features are contained in Acrobat for editing movies. However, after you create video clips 
in authoring applications, you have the wealth of import options and play opportunities similar to 
those used with sound files.
NOTE
NOTE
One exception to editing movies in Acrobat is an option to clip a video that is avail-
able in Acrobat Pro Extended. See the section later in this chapter on “Importing 
video (Acrobat Pro Extended).”
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
Video files are not limited to movie files. You can also use the various attribute 
choices for importing and changing properties with Adobe Flash files. Both video 
and Flash files can be imported and managed in Acrobat similarly.
Video editing at the high end is handled by sophisticated software such as Final Cut Pro, Adobe 
Premiere, Adobe After Effects, and other similar professional programs designed to offer you limit-
less choices for editing video and audio channels. On the low end, you have some impressive features 
in programs that cost very little. For Windows, Adobe’s marvelous consumer image editor, Adobe 
Photoshop Elements, is a low-cost editing program that offers you options for exporting to PDF slide 
shows, embedding sound files, and mixing slides and video clips. The great advantage of using 
Photoshop Elements for media creations is that the program exports direct to PDF along with side 
transitions and imported sounds that open directly in Acrobat in Full Screen mode. In addition to 
video editing, you can use Adobe Flash CS3 to create Flash FLV and SWF files that can be converted 
to PDF.
For Macintosh users, Apple’s own iMovie is a free application shipping with System OS X that 
produces QuickTime movies. iMovie supports PDF imports as well as still photos and video clips. 
If you happen to be a cross-platform user, the combination of using Photoshop Elements 6 and 
iMovie offers you a sophisticated editing environment where you can produce PDF presentations 
and displays for just about any purpose.

Discussion in this chapter is related to multimedia authoring and working with 
video, Flash, and sound in PDF documents. For additional information related 
to creating presentations and other application support for various kinds of animation, see 
Chapter 28.
There are other programs that enable you to create movie files. You can use Adobe Premiere 
Elements (Windows only), Microsoft Media Maker (Windows only), Final Cut Express HD 
(Macintosh only), and a number of different shareware programs that enable you to edit digital 
video clips. You can also use Adobe Illustrator to export Flash SWF files and Photoshop CS4 to 
edit movie clips. Regardless of the video editor you use, you can import video clips in PDF files 
from a huge range of supported video formats.

Importing video legacy content (Acrobat Pro and 
Pro Extended)
 
 When you import video in Acrobat Pro on either Windows or the Macintosh, you must use 
 the legacy content import options unless you import H.264 (MPEG-4 Part 10) compression 
on the video files. Legacy content has the same video import options you had available with 
Acrobat 8 and earlier viewers. When importing video you have choices to link a video file to a 
PDF or embed a video file in a PDF. If you use Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows), you can choose 
to import files using the legacy content methods or the new Acrobat 9 option for transcoding 
video to Adobe Flash.
Use the Video tool in the Multimedia toolbar to import video files in Acrobat Pro viewers. Select 
the Video tool from the Toolbar Well and double-click the mouse button or click and drag open 
a rectangle. When you release the mouse button, the Insert Video dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 23.21. When you use the Video tool to import video clips, the initial dialog box appears 
very similar to the Insert Sound dialog box.
 FIGURE 23.21
The Insert Video dialog box offers you options similar to the Insert Sound dialog box.
TIP
TIP
When you double-click the mouse button, the movie frame defaults to the size to 
which the video was compressed. If you want to size the frame up or down, press 
Shift and drag one of the four handles with the Video tool or the Select Object tool to reshape 
the rectangle after a video has been imported. Know that if you size up the movie frame from the 
default size, the video looks distorted when played.
Be aware that if you have Acrobat Pro (Windows or Macintosh), you only have options for using 
the legacy content method for importing video if importing files not compressed with H.264 com-
pression. This section relates exclusively to using Acrobat Pro on Windows and the Macintosh on 
files not compressed with H.264 compression. For more options with Acrobat Pro with H.264-
compressed video and Acrobat Pro Extended, see the section “Importing Video (Acrobat Pro 
Extended)” later in this chapter.

When you click the Browse button, the Select a file dialog box opens. Select a file to import and 
click Open. If you’re using Acrobat Pro an alert dialog box opens and informs you that the file is not 
supported for direct playback in Adobe Reader. (Actually, it’s Adobe Reader 9 that has the Flash 
player hard coded in Reader 9). The message continues with: Acrobat Pro Extended is required to 
convert to a compatible format. To place this file for playback requiring an external system player 
click Continue.
What the dialog box means is that if you import the video using Acrobat Pro you’re forced to use a 
legacy format and the Add Movie dialog box opens as shown in Figure 23.22. From here you can 
choose to import video using Acrobat 6 (and Later) Compatible Media and Acrobat 5 (and Earlier) 
Compatible Media. If you are using Acrobat Pro Extended you have other options for converting 
the video as I explain later in the section “Importing Video (Acrobat Pro Extended).
 FIGURE 23.22
When importing video in Acrobat Pro, the Add Movie dialog box opens after you select a video file.
Travel back to Figure 23.21 for a moment and check out the blue text link that reads Create legacy 
multimedia content. Clicking this link opens the Add Movie dialog box. For Acrobat Pro Extended 
users, this link is essential if you want to create legacy content supported in Acrobat viewers earlier 
than version 9.

In Acrobat Pro, double-click the Video tool on a page to open the Insert Video dialog box. If using 
Acrobat Pro, click the Browse button to locate a video file, select the file, and click Open. If using 
Acrobat Pro Extended, click the blue text link in the Insert Video dialog box to Create legacy multi-
media content. In either case you end up at the Add Movie dialog box. Click Acrobat 5 (and Earlier) 
Compatible Media and the dialog box changes to what you see in Figure 23.23.

I
f you travel the route of the legacy path using the Add Movie dialog box in either Acrobat Pro or 
Acrobat Pro Extended, the playback of your video uses an external player. The player may be the 
external Adobe Flash Player, Windows built-in player, RealOne Player, Windows Media Player, or 
Apple’s QuickTime. This behavior is the same as all versions of Acrobat supporting media playback 
prior to Acrobat 9.0.
If you use the Insert Media dialog box and insert media without following the legacy path, your 
media is transcoded to Adobe Flash format and the built-in Flash player handles the playback. No 
external player including the external Adobe Flash Player is needed to play back the video using the 
new Acrobat 9–compatible media imports.

Figure 23.23 shows the Add Movie dialog box options for Acrobat 5–compatible movies. You have 
options for selecting either Acrobat 5 or Acrobat 6 compatibility like you do with sound imports. 
When you select the Acrobat 5 (and Earlier) Compatible Media radio button, the dialog box reduces 
in size and displays only the options available when using Acrobat 5 or earlier compatibility.
Add Movie
You make choices in the Add Movie dialog box when you first create a movie field. After creating 
the field, you can make changes and select attributes in the Movie Properties dialog box that are 
similar to the Sound properties choices. In the Add Movie dialog box, you select from the following:
 Content Settings. Click on the compatibility for either Acrobat 5– or Acrobat 6–compat-
ible media. If you select Acrobat 5 compatibility, the movie clips cannot be embedded 
in the PDF file — the files are linked to the PDF. Therefore, you need to send the PDF 
and the movie file to other users or host both on a Web site in order for users to view the 
movies. If you use Acrobat 6–compatible media, you have a choice to either embed the 
media in the PDF or link the media to the PDF. If using Acrobat 6–compatible media and 
embedding movie clips in a PDF, Acrobat users with viewers earlier than Acrobat 6 won’t 
be able to see your movie files.
 Location. On local drives, the location of the movie file is added to the Location field box. 
When you first import a movie, identify the movie in the Add Movie dialog box and leave 
the Location at the default. After you create the movie rectangle, you can change the loca-
tion to a URL for Web-hosted documents in the Movie Properties dialog box.
 Browse. Click this button to open the Select Movie File dialog box. If importing a movie 
from your hard drive, select the video and click Select to import the video. You may need 
to wait momentarily as Acrobat reports the import status.
NOTE

If you move a movie file on your hard drive to another location, the path to the file 
is broken and the movie won’t play. To reset the directory path, click the Browse 
button, find the movie file, and click Select in the Select Movie File dialog box.
 Snap to content proportions. When enabled, the movie remains proportional as you 
drag open a rectangle, preventing distortion when the movie is played. The media file’s 
original dimensions are preserved no matter how large you draw the rectangle.
 Poster Settings. Select the Use no poster option to show a blank video frame. Select the 
Retrieve poster from movie option to show the first movie frame in the movie rectangle 
when the movie is not playing.

If you choose Full Screen from the menu choices, the video plays at the largest possible size on 
your monitor in a separate window. However, the video playback does not change the view to Full 
Screen mode.
Options for showing the player controls and using a floating window are handled a little differently 
than when enabling the same options for sound files. The player controls are fixed at the bottom 
of the video clip for viewing movies either with or without a floating window. When you choose 
Floating Window for a video file, the media opens in a floating window with the player controls 
fixed at the bottom of the floating window. In Figure 23.26 you can see the video frame playing 
with the player controls visible at the default size of the video. In Figure 23.27 the player controls 
are enabled as well as the floating window option.

Appearance options are also the same as those discussed for Sound properties. In the Appearance 
options, you have access to showing the movie poster in the file when the movie is still and not 
playing. If you choose to Put the Poster in the Document, you can also make choices for the color 
display of 8-bit (256 colors) or 24-bit (millions of colors).

first movie annotation by clicking it with the Video tool or the Select Object tool. Press Backspace/
Delete on your keyboard or open a context menu and choose Edit ➪ Delete. Double-click the 
mouse button with the Video tool and select Acrobat 6 compatibility; the dialog box changes to

movies you have options for the poster view in a still frame while the movie is not playing. Select 
from Use no poster, Retrieve poster from movie, or Create poster from file. These options are the 
same for sounds with the exception of Retrieve poster from movie. Whereas sound files produce 
an error when you make this menu choice, movie files retrieve the first frame in the video for the

When you import a sound or video, the rendition of the clip is assigned to a Mouse Up trigger and 
plays according to the properties you enable for the play options. By default, imported sounds 
and videos have a single default rendition. When using Acrobat 6–compatible media options, you 
have an opportunity to add different renditions to the same media clip or multiple media clips. For 
example, you may have a rendition that plays full screen from a large file, and you may want to 
add an alternate clip of a duplicate movie with a smaller file size. If hosting the media on a Web

site, you can assign what media clip is downloaded to a user’s computer based on the end user’s 
connection speed. The movie field remains the same, but the attributes contain two different rendi-
tions for the same field.
You have options for editing existing renditions after importing a media clip, or you can add new 
renditions to an imported file. When you add new renditions, they are listed in the Settings tab in 
the Multimedia Properties dialog box.
Adding a rendition
By default, a rendition is listed in the lower window in the Settings properties. To add a rendition, 
click the Add Rendition button. A pull-down menu opens where you make choices for one of the 
following:
 Using a File. For local files select Using a File. The Select Multimedia File dialog box 
opens where you navigate your hard drive and select the file to use. This option might 
be used to select a duplicate file smaller or larger in size than the original rendition.
 Using a URL. If you want files downloaded from Web sites, select Using a URL. The Add 
a New Rendition Using a URL dialog box opens where you add the URL address for where 
the file is located. When you add the URL, a pull-down menu opens where you can select 
the content type for the media format.
 By Copying an Existing Rendition. If you want to use the same rendition as one listed 
in the Settings list window for the purpose of duplicating the rendition and providing 
alternate attributes, select By Copying an Existing Rendition. The Copy Rendition dialog 
box opens in which you select the rendition to copy from a pull-down menu. The new 
rendition is not actually copied, but instead points to another file and adds about 4K to 
your file size.
Select any one of the three options and click the Edit button to open the Rendition Settings 
dialog box.
Editing a rendition
You can choose to edit an existing rendition or edit the new rendition you added to the media file 
(see the preceding section). If you want to edit an existing rendition, click the Edit Rendition button 
from the Settings properties. If you’ve added a new rendition, it now appears in the list window, so 
you can select it and click the Edit button. In either case, the Rendition Settings dialog box opens, 
as shown in Figure 23.30.

 FIGURE 23.30
Select a rendition and click the Edit button. The Rendition Settings dialog box opens.
A considerable number of options are available in the various tabs of the Rendition Settings dialog 
box. By default, the dialog box opens at the Media Settings tab. The various tabs and choices you 
have include:
 Media Settings. Make choices from the Media Settings tab for the rendition name, the 
media location and content type, and the rendition for alternate text, and choose from the 
Allow Temp File pull-down menu for various options related to accessibility. If the media 
is to be made accessible to JavaScript, be certain to check the box for enabling JavaScript.
 Playback Settings. Click the Playback Settings tab to make choices for the player window 
visibility, volume settings, showing player controls, continuous looping, or times played. 
In the list at the bottom of the Playback Settings tab, click the Add button to add the type 
of media players you want users to use for playing the media. You have an option for 
enabling all players and a setting for the preferred player.
 Playback Location. Make choices on this tab for where the media is played, such as in 
the document, floating window, or full screen. If you select floating window, you have 
many different choices for document size and position.

 System Requirements. From a pull-down menu you have choices for connection speeds. 
If you want a particular rendition to be downloaded for all users with 384K connections 
or greater, you can make the choice in this dialog box. In addition you have choices for 
screen displays, captions, subtitles, and language.
 Playback Requirements. Based on options you selected in the other settings tabs, a list is 
displayed in the last settings tab. Each item has a check box for enabling a required con-
dition. Check all the boxes for those items you want to make a required function.
Click OK in the Rendition Settings dialog box when you’re finished setting the options in the vari-
ous settings tabs. If you need to add another rendition with some alternate options to the last ren-
dition you edited, copy the rendition and make the necessary edits. You can list as many different 
renditions as you like to provide more flexibility for your viewer audience and the systems it uses.

Actions
The Actions tab also offers the same choices as those available with sound files for adding an action 
to the media clip. You can choose an action from the Select Action pull-down menu the same as 
when using action types with Acrobat 5 media.
Importing video (Acrobat Pro Extended)
Notice you have the same option for choosing legacy multimedia content in the Insert Video dialog 
box. Click the blue text link to open the Add Movie dialog box as shown earlier in Figures 23.22 
and 23.23. If you prepare files for Acrobat viewers earlier than version 9, use the settings you have 
available for either Acrobat 6 (and Later) Compatible Media or Acrobat 5 (and Earlier) Compatible 
Media. Options you find in the Properties dialog boxes for these media types are the same as those 
options described in the sections “Acrobat 5–compatible media” and “Acrobat 6–compatible media.”
Acrobat Pro Extended users can import a video file without changing settings and exploring the 
many options you have for importing a video file. You can simply click a few buttons and your 
video is imported in a PDF and transcoded to an Adobe Flash file. The video can be played in all 
Acrobat viewers version 9 and above. If you intend to share PDFs with users of Acrobat viewers 
earlier than version 9, you need to use the legacy multimedia content options.
For a quick look at importing a video in Acrobat Pro Extended, follow these steps.
Steps: Importing a video with Acrobat 9 compatibility 
(Windows only)
 
1. Open a PDF document in Acrobat Pro Extended.
 
2. Click the Video tool in the Multimedia toolbar or open the Multimedia task button 
and select the Video tool.
 
3. Double-click the Video tool on a document page. When you double-click using the 
Video tool, the video is imported at the same size the video was originally compressed.
 
4. Browse for the file location. The Insert Video dialog box shown earlier in Figure 23.21 
opens. Be certain to not click the link for Create legacy multimedia content. Click the 
Browse button to locate the file and leave all the other settings at the defaults.
 
5. Import the video. The Select a file dialog box opens. Select the file you want to import 
and click Open. Note that you may have to wait a few minutes for Acrobat to read the file.
 
6. Set the attributes for importing the file. After you click Open in the Select a file dialog 
box, the Insert Video dialog box changes as shown in Figure 23.32. Below the preview of 
the first video frame you see two sliders. You can move the left and right sliders to clip the 
movie and convert only the portion of the clip that you want to import. In Figure 23.32 I 
moved the left slider to about halfway along the path, resulting in clipping the first half of 
the video.
 
 Click the button Set Poster Image from Content Frame to capture the content frame as a 
poster and click OK.

You can capture any frame in your video clip to use as a poster image. Move the 
sliders to view the video in the Insert Video dialog box and stop at the frame you 
want to capture. Click the Set Poster Image from Current Frame button to capture the frame. 
Readjust the sliders to clip the video or return to the default positions. When the video is 
imported, the first frame you see is the captured frame.
 
7. Wait for transcoding to complete. Acrobat begins transcoding the video to an Adobe 
Flash file. A progress bar is displayed during the transcoding process as shown in Figure 
23.33. Wait for the transcoding to complete. Acrobat returns you to the document pane 
where your imported video is shown with the poster image you chose in the Insert Video 
dialog box.

For quick and easy video imports, you can follow the steps outlined here. However, Acrobat 9 
offers you a number of options for importing video files and changing properties. Becoming famil-
iar with the options helps you take advantage of Acrobat’s impressive video viewing and playback 
opportunities. You can make option choices during the import steps or address properties after 
videos have been imported.
Using advanced settings
When you open the Insert Video dialog box you see an abbreviated set of options that are available 
for video imports. To expand the dialog box, click the Show Advanced Options check box to 
expand the dialog box to the view shown in Figure 23.34.

Before you import a video in Acrobat Pro or Pro Extended, you have a number of settings choices 
in the Insert Video Advanced Options dialog box. Your choices include:
NOTE
NOTE
You only see the Quality tab if the video is not H264 encoded.
 Launch Settings. The first of four tabs appears as the default. In the Launch settings tab 
you make choices for launching the video.
 Enable When. Earlier in this chapter in the section “Adding sounds to page actions,” 
I talked about triggering a sound to play based on Page Open and Page Close actions. 
When using Acrobat 9–compatible media, you can choose to trigger a video to play on 
a page open or page close action from choices in this menu.
 Disable When. You can stop play on the same choices you have for Enable When. If 
you want to stop the media from playing when you navigate to the next page, open 
this pull-down menu and choose The page containing the content is closed.
 Playback Style. Your choices are to play the content on the page or play the content 
in a floating window.
 Width/Height. You can edit the annotation frame for the size by typing values in the 
text boxes for floating windows only.
 Border. Choose from Thin, Medium, or Thick to add a border to the annotation frame.
 Poster Image. You make choices here for the poster image. If you click Create poster 
from file, click the Browse button to locate a file to use as a poster image. File formats 
that are supported are Adobe PDF, BMP, Compuserve GIF, JPEG, and PNG.
 Quality. Click the Quality tab to find settings for the display of the video quality as 
shown in Figure 23.35.
 Video Quality. Choose from Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Very High for 
the video quality.
 Deinterlace. If the video was interlaced, check this box. By default you typically won’t 
need to deinterlace videos for most of the content you import in PDF documents.
Using H.264 (Part 10) Compressed Files
H.264 or MPEG-4 Part 10 is a newer compression format for video. It’s an ISO standard for video 
compression that takes up less capacity when it is stored or transmitted. H.264 compression can be 
applied to a variety of video formats and also plays back directly in all Acrobat viewers including 
Adobe Reader 9. As the H.264 format is gaining in popularity, Adobe’s expectation is that you’ll be 
able to place video without importing in legacy formats.
If you use H.264-compressed video, you have access to the Advanced Settings in the Insert Video 
dialog box, and you can bypass the legacy multimedia content dialog boxes. You have options for 
choosing among all the Launch settings and playback skins in the Insert Video advanced settings.

Editing a video
When you adjust settings in the Insert Video dialog box in Acrobat Pro Extended, you apply all 
the properties settings you want to use for the imported video. If you import a video and open the 
properties, the Edit Video dialog box opens. Unlike legacy content, you have choices matching 
most of the settings you apply when you initially import the video using Advanced Settings in the 
Insert Video dialog box.
In the Edit Video dialog box, you find the same choices you have for Launch Settings, Controls, 
and Video. The options not accessible when you choose Properties from a context menu opened 
on an imported media are the Quality Controls. If you want to change the quality for video and/or 
sound, you must delete the video and import it again, making adjustments in the Advanced Settings 
in the Insert Video dialog box.
Importing Flash Video (Acrobat Pro and 
Pro Extended)
The file formats you can import related to Adobe Flash include Flash Video File (FLV) and Flash 
Movie File (SWF). An FLV file is a native file saved from Adobe Flash, and an SWF file is a movie 
file exported from Adobe Flash or another program supporting SWF exports.
Using Skins
Skins are Adobe Flash files that display player controls when you enable the player controls options in 
the Insert Video dialog box or Movie Properties. By default, Acrobat installs seven different skins you 
can use when playing video, with or without volume controls, muting sound, and showing captions.
You can add your own custom skins and have them appear in the Playback tab Skin pull-down menu. 
To add your own custom skins you’ll need to use Adobe Flex and export the files as Flash movies. After 
you create a custom skin, you then need to add the file to the appropriate folder in Acrobat.
On Windows, open the Acrobat 9.0/Acrobat/Multimedia Skins folder and copy your custom skins to 
this folder.
On the Macintosh open the Applications/Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro folder and Control+click the Adobe 
Acrobat Pro icon. From the context menu options choose Show Package Contents. (Note that 
Multimedia Skins are not installed in the Acrobat User Data folder on the Macintosh). When the 
package contents are shown, open Contents/MacOS/Multimedia Skins. Copy your custom skins to 
this folder. For Macintosh users, the skins are available only when using H.264-compressed video or 
playing FLV videos.

If you use the Video tool, you can import both FLV and SWF files. However, the default file for-
mats support only FLV files. If you want to use the Video tool to import an SWF file, you must 
change the Files of type menu choice to All Files (*.*); you’ll see the SWF files accessible in the 
Select a file dialog box.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
A better choice is to select the Flash tool from the Multimedia 
toolbar or from the Multimedia task button pull-down menu. When you use the 
Flash tool, all supported Adobe Flash formats appear in the Files of type pull-down menu.
 Double-click the Flash tool to import a Flash FLV or SWF file. The Insert Flash dialog box 
 opens. This dialog box is similar to the Insert Video dialog box. An abbreviated list of settings 
is shown similar to Figure 23.21. Clicking the Show Advanced Settings check box expands the 
Insert Flash dialog box to display similar settings you have when importing video.
Only three tabs are shown in the Insert Flash dialog box. The tabs include:
 Launch Settings. The Launch Settings include identical settings you have when import-
ing a video file.
 Flash. The Flash tab offers you an option to pass Flash variables (ActionScript 2.0 and 
3.0 FlashVars) to a URL string.
 Resources. The Resources tab enables you to bind a file, multiple files, or a directory of 
files to video.
Like the Insert Video dialog box you make choices for the settings and select a file to import. Click 
the OK button to import the Flash file in a PDF document.
Importing 3D Content
 
 The 3D tool in the Multimedia toolbar is used for importing 3D content in a PDF file. Select 
 the tool from either the Multimedia toolbar or the Multimedia task button pull-down menu. 
Double-click the tool on a document page to open the Insert 3D dialog box.
Again this dialog box is similar to the Insert Video dialog box. When you click the Show 
Advanced Settings check box, the Insert 3D dialog box expands to show several tabs. The first tab 
choice is Launch Settings and offers the same choices you find in the Insert Video and Insert 
Flash dialog boxes. The third tab is Resources and offers the same choices you find in the Insert 
Flash Resources tab.

dinary and beyond the scope of this book. For a complete listing of all options, refer to the Acrobat 
Pro Extended Help document.
After you import a 3D file, the default settings you choose in the Insert 3D dialog box can be changed 
by using the 3D toolbar. If you enable the Show Toolbar check box in the 3D tab, the toolbar is 
shown by default when the mouse cursor is placed over a 3D import. From the toolbar shown in 
Figure 23.38 you have a number of choices to change views, lighting, perspective, model render-
ing views, background color choices, cross section viewing, and adding comments.

 FIGURE 23.38
The 3D toolbar offers many options to change views from the defaults you set up in the Insert 3D dialog box.
Converting Media to PDF
Another option you have with Acrobat 9 is direct conversion of media files to PDF. Rather than 
import a media file, you use the Create task button and choose the PDF from File command. When 
you choose a video file, an Adobe Flash file, or a 3D file, the file is converted to PDF and opens in 
Acrobat at the default size the file was originally created in the authoring program.
You can convert a file to PDF and use the Select Object tool to select the media box. Open a context 
menu and choose Edit ➪ Copy. Once copied to the Clipboard, you can paste the media in another 
PDF document.

Summary
 Sound files can be imported with either Acrobat 5 or Acrobat 6 compatibility. Acrobat 
5–compatible sound imports can be used with earlier Acrobat viewers. Acrobat 6–
compatible sounds are available only to Acrobat 6 or later viewers. Acrobat 6 compati-
bility offers more options for attribute settings and file format compatibility.
 You can add sounds to page actions, links, bookmarks, and form fields, or by using the 
Sound tool.
 Importing sounds on actions or with the Sound tool requires you to have access to a 
sound file. You create and save sound files from sound-editing programs. A number of 
sound-editing programs are available as freeware or shareware on the Internet.
 You can edit movie files in multimedia authoring programs. Among low-cost alternatives 
for creating movie files are Adobe Photoshop Elements and Apple Computer’s iMovie. 
You can save Photoshop Elements files direct to PDF. You save iMovie files in QuickTime 
format and import them in PDFs with the Movie tool.
 Movie and sound legacy content can have several renditions. Renditions offer you many 
options for assigning attributes to sound and media clips, as well as providing end users 
with alternatives for downloading different versions of the same file.
 You can embed Acrobat 6–compatible media files in PDF documents. Acrobat 6–compatible 
media files offer much more support for importing different file formats than Acrobat 
5–compatible media imports.

L
ayers are an integral part of many professional imaging applications 
and specialized technical programs, such as AutoCAD and Microsoft 
Visio. In Acrobat versions 6 through 9 you can view native layered 
documents and toggle on and off different layer views.
With the introduction of the Adobe Creative Suite, support for Adobe PDF 
layers has been integrated into Adobe Illustrator CS and Adobe InDesign CS. 
As we advance in time and software development, more applications are 
supporting exports to PDF with layer data.
Design and creative, scientific, and engineering professionals can find many 
uses for communicating ideas and concepts with layered documents. To help 
simplify the viewing of layered documents, you can add interactive buttons 
for guiding users through various layer views. In this chapter, you learn about 
what constitutes a PDF with layers, how to manage them, and how to create 
links to different layer views.
Setting Up the Work Environment
Viewing layers requires no special set of toolbars — the tools you need are 
dependent on what you intend to do with a PDF containing layers when you 
begin editing. If, for example, you intend to review and comment layered 
documents, you’ll open the Comment and Markup toolbar.
If you work with engineering drawings, you’ll want to open the Analysis 
toolbar and the Advanced Editing toolbar. For other layered documents, you 
won’t need any special tools. If you open these toolbars, your Toolbar Well 
will look like Figure 24.1.

You may also need to load the Layers panel if not currently shown in the Navigation pane. Select 
View ➪ Navigation Panels ➪ Layers. Drag the Layers panel to the Navigation pane to dock it.
Understanding Layers
Acrobat supports the creation of layered documents from several authoring programs. Among the 
programs supporting the PDFMaker are Microsoft Visio, Microsoft Project, and Autodesk AutoCAD. 
In regard to exporting to PDF with Adobe PDF layers, you can use Adobe Illustrator CS and Adobe 
InDesign CS and some specialized programs such as ESRI’s ArcGIS (www.esri.com/software/
arcgis/). When layers are created in these programs, the document can be converted to PDF 
with Adobe PDF layers and viewed in all Acrobat viewers 6.0 and above with the layers intact. 
Other Creative Suite programs such as Adobe Dreamweaver and Adobe Photoshop CS do not sup-
port layered PDFs. 
The creation of Adobe PDF layers requires Acrobat Pro or Acrobat Pro Extended; however, after 
the PDF creation, layers can be viewed in any Acrobat 6.0 or later viewer, including Adobe Reader.
There are two important points to understand when creating layered PDF files. First, you must 
begin with an authoring program that supports layers. Adobe Illustrator, Adobe PageMaker, Adobe 
InDesign, CorelDraw, Autodesk AutoCAD, and Microsoft Visio are some of the popular imaging 
programs that support layers. Second, the authoring application must export to the PDF 1.5 format 
or above (Acrobat 6 compatibility or later). Just because the authoring program supports layers is 
no guarantee that your resultant PDF will contain layers.
If you use a program that enables you to create and save layered documents and the program does 
not currently export to Acrobat 6 or later compatibility, log on to your software manufacturer’s 
Web site and see whether a new version of the program is available and whether the latest release 
exports to PDF v1.5 or higher.
NOTE
NOTE
Layers in Acrobat terms are referred to as Optional Content Groups (OCGs). When 
you see the term OCG, understand that the term refers to a PDF document with 
Adobe PDF layers.

Layer Visibility
When you open a layered document in Acrobat and the Layers panel is open in the Navigation 
pane, you see a list of all the layers contained in the document and an eye icon adjacent to each 
layer name when the respective layer is in view. A layer’s visibility is either on or off, as shown in 
the Layers panel.
Initial visibility is determined from the visibility shown in the original authoring program when the 
PDF is created. In Figure 24.2 you see a layered document with three layers visible as indicated by 
the eye icons in the Layers panel. The remaining layers in the document are hidden and the hidden 
state is expressed in the Layers panel by the absence of an eye icon adjacent to the layer names.
 FIGURE 24.2
The initial visibility of layers in this file shows three layers in view as indicated by the eye icons. Those 
layers where no eye icon appears are hidden.

826
PDF Interactivity
Part IV
Setting initial visibility
The initial layer visibility is the default view of visible layers when you open a PDF document. The 
layers in view when you open a layered PDF document are determined from the visibility of the lay-
ers in view in the original authoring application. If layers are hidden in the authoring application, 
the Initial View in Acrobat viewers shows the same layers hidden as well. The Initial View or state 
is the same view displayed in the authoring application at the time of PDF creation. As you browse 
a file in an Acrobat viewer and turn on and off different layer views, you may want to return to the 
initial state. You return to the default view with the Reset to Initial Visibility menu command in 
the Options pull-down menu in the Layers panel, as shown in Figure 24.3. Select this command to 
return to the layer views you saw when you first opened the PDF document.
 FIGURE 24.3
To return to the default layer visibility, open the Options pull-down menu in the Layers panel and select 
Reset to Initial Visibility.
Showing/hiding layers
You show and hide individual layers by clicking on the eye icons in the Layers panel. When an eye 
icon is hidden, the respective layer is hidden. If you want to display a hidden layer, click in the box 
adjacent to a layer name; the eye icon appears, and the layer is made visible in the Document pane.
At times, you may have pages in a PDF with different layers associated with different pages. If you 
want to display all layers on the page in view in the Document pane while hiding layers on other 
pages in your document, select List Layers for Visible Pages in the Options pull-down menu. All 
layers not contained on the pages in view in the Document pane are hidden. If the same layer spans 
more than one page and you select this menu command, the layer is made visible only when the 
layer is contained on the active page.
When you change layer visibility in the Layers panel and save the PDF document, the layer visibility 
is not recorded when you save the file. When you open a file after saving with a different layer view,

you are still returned to the initial visibility from your first editing session. To create a new default 
Initial View, you need to change the Layer properties.
Initial Views
You can open the Layers panel when the PDF is opened in the Document pane by setting the Initial 
View in the Document Properties. Choose File ➪  Properties and click the Initial View tab. From 
the Navigation tab pull-down menu, select Layers Panel and Page. Save the PDF document. When 
you reopen the file, the Layers panel is expanded to show the layers.

For more information on Initial Views, see Chapter 5.
Layer Properties
Layer properties are specific to each layer. To open the Layer Properties dialog box, you must have 
a layer selected in the Layers panel. Click on a layer name and open a context menu (or choose 
Options ➪ Layer Properties). The context menu contains two menu options — one for Show Layer 
and the other for Properties (unless it is a locked layer, in which case Properties is the only option). 
Select Properties to open the Layer Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 24.4.

Part IV
You adjust layer properties for individual layers only. Acrobat does not permit you to select multi-
ple layers. If you need to make changes in visibility for several layers, you must open the Layer 
Properties dialog box independently for each layer or, alternately, return to the original authoring 
program and set the default layer visibility and convert to PDF. 
When you open the Layer Properties dialog box, the layer name appears in the dialog box for the 
respective layer contained in the Layers panel. Two radio buttons exist for the Intent. By default 
you see View selected, which is normal viewing mode. Select View to allow the layer to be turned 
on or off. If you click Reference, the remaining items in the dialog box are disabled and the eye 
icon in the Layers panel disappears. All layer attribute choices are disabled and the behavior is sim-
ilar to locking a layer. You use View to keep the layer on at all times, which permits editing layer 
properties. When a layer is set to the Reference Intent, the layer name appears in italics.
Changing the default state
The Default state pull-down menu contains menu options for either On or Off. The menu choice 
you make here determines the layer visibility when a file is opened. If you want to change the default 
state, select On or Off from the pull-down menu. When you click OK in the Layer Properties dia-
log box and save the PDF document, the default visibility changes according to the views you set 
in the Layer Properties.
Locking visibility
When you select the Locked check box, you lock the layer visibility (either on or off). A lock icon 
appears in the Layers tab and prevents you from turning the visibility on or off from the tab. You 
need to return to the Properties dialog box and disable the check box to return visibility control to 
the Layers panel. You might use Reference and Lock, and then secure a PDF file to prevent users 
from seeing information on a given layer.

Changing the initial state
Initial State settings include Layer Visibility, Print, and Export. The default state described previously 
enables you to determine whether a layer is visible or hidden when a PDF document opens. To 
apply the individual settings for layer states, you enable a preference setting. Open the Preferences 
dialog box and select Documents in the left pane. Check the box for Allow layer state to be set by 
user information, as shown in Figure 24.5. 

829
Working with Layers
24
 FIGURE 24.5
Open Preferences and click Documents in the left pane. Check Allow layer state to be set by user 
information. 
When this preference option is enabled, the layer state options chosen from the Initial State pull-
down menus override the layer visibility set from the Default State pull-down menu. For example, 
if the default state is set to On and the preference item is deselected, the PDF opens with the layer 
visible. If you enable the preference settings and select Always Visible from the Visibility pull-down 
menu, the layer is always visible regardless of whether you have the default state On or Off.
The options for initial states include the following:
 Visibility. Three choices are available from this pull-down menu. They include Visible 
When On, Never Visible, and Always Visible. The first option displays a layer according 
to whether you have the eye icon visible in the Layers panel. When toggled on, the layer 
is visible. When toggled off, the layer is hidden. Never Visible hides the layer data regard-
less of whether the default state is on or off. Always Visible always shows the layer.
 Print. You may have a watermark or message that you want to eliminate or display on 
a printed page. The three choices, Prints When Visible, Never Prints, and Always Prints, 
are similar to the options for visibility. Printing a layer does not require the layer to be in 
view in the Document pane at the time you print the file if Always Prints is selected.
 Export. This setting applies to exporting PDF documents back into authoring programs 
using a Save As command and selecting a file format compatible with your intended 
authoring program. Export provides you the same three options when exporting layer 
data as are available for printing. You can eliminate layers exported by selecting Never 
Exports, or hide or show a layer and choose Exports When Visible. Likewise, you can 
choose to always export a layer regardless of the visibility and print settings by selecting 
Always Exports.

CROSS-REF
For information on exporting PDF data back to authoring programs, see Chapter 9.
The window at the bottom of the dialog box displays information according to the initial state(s) 
you select from the pull-down menu. When you open the Properties dialog box you can see, at a 
glance, the options for each initial state. At the bottom of the scrollable list is information related to 
the authoring document that was exported to PDF. By default when the initial state is set to Visible 
When On, you see no view information in the window at the bottom of the Properties dialog box. 

830

Part IV
Change the Visibility to Never Visible or Always Visible. Click OK and when you open the Layers 
Properties dialog box, a new category labeled “View” appears at the bottom of the window. Below 
the category name you see ViewState: ON or ViewState: OFF depending on the respective visibility 
choice you made after changing the initial state.
A good real-world condition for setting a layer state to be visible when printing is when you want 
to use a watermark or stamp on printed copies. If you want the watermark or stamp to be hidden 
when viewing the PDF in Acrobat, set the layer visibility for Print to Prints When Visible. If you 
distribute the document and want all users to print a watermark or some symbol, secure the docu-
ment with Acrobat security and other users won’t be able to avoid printing the file without the mark. 
In Figure 24.6 you see a PDF file as it prints. The watermark is not visible when viewed onscreen.

CROSS-REF
For more on creating and using watermarks, see Chapter 16.
Overriding defaults
In your original authoring program you can create PDF documents with layers that aren’t visible 
in the Layers panel. You can also hide layers in the Default State or the Initial State pull-down 
menus. If you change defaults to hide layers in the Layers panel, you can change layer visibility in 
the Options menu. If the Options menu shows a menu item for overriding a layer state grayed out, 
the menu choice is not available. To change the options, you need to return to the Layer Properties 
dialog box.
Open the Options pull-down menu to see the following three options for overriding defaults:
 Apply Print Overrides. When selected, this option overrides any options you made for 
not printing layers. When you select this menu item in the Options panel, when you print 
the PDF all the layers are printed.
 Apply Export Overrides. When selected, this option overrides any options you made for 
exporting layer data. When you select this option, all layer data are exported.
 Apply Layer Overrides. Layer Overrides relates to the layer visibility. When this option 
is enabled, all layers are visible in the Document pane, but the individual layer visibility 
options are no longer available to you. You cannot click on an eye icon for hiding a layer 
when the override is enabled. To individually show or hide a layer, you need to deselect 
the Apply Layer Overrides menu option and use the Layers panel for showing/hiding 
layers.

Watermarks on separate layers can appear on a printed document but are not visible when a PDF is in 
view in the Document pane. 
Managing layers
You can edit layers in that you can name, merge, and flatten them. However, you cannot rearrange 
layers in Acrobat. To rename a layer, select the layer in the Layers panel and click a second time 
on the layer name. The layer name is highlighted. Begin typing, and the text you type replaces the 
highlighted text. You can click and drag across a layer name and edit a portion of the text much 
like you might change names in Bookmarks. You can also edit layer names in the Layer Properties 
dialog box. If you are changing properties and decide you also want to change a layer name, select 
the name in the Layer Name field in the Layer Properties dialog box and edit the name.
Merging layers
You can merge layers whether they are visible or hidden. All layer merging takes place in the Merge 
Layers dialog box and is available only to users of Acrobat Pro and Acrobat Pro Extended. To open 
the dialog box, select Merge Layers from the Options pull-down menu in the Layers panel. The 
Merge Layers dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 24.7.

832
PDF Interactivity
Part IV
 FIGURE 24.7
To merge layers, select Merge Layers from the Options pull-down menu. The Merge Layers dialog box 
opens where all layers (visible and hidden) are listed in the Layers to be merged column.
Regardless of whether a layer is visible or hidden, the list in the Layers to be merged column on 
the left side of the dialog box includes all layers in the document in a scrollable window. You can 
merge visible layers with hidden layers. To merge layers, select the layers to be merged into a sin-
gle layer from the list on the left and click the Add button. You can select multiple layers by hold-
ing down the Shift key for a contiguous selection or by using the Ctrl key (Windows) or Ô key 
(Macintosh) to randomly select layer names in a noncontiguous group.
When the layers to be merged are visible in the center column, select the target layer in the Target 
layer to merge into column. The name you select here is the name listed in the Layers panel and 
contains all the data from the other layers. The properties associated with the target layer become 
the properties in the merged layer. After you merge layers, all previous layer names are removed 
from the Layers panel.
When adding layers to the list in the center of the dialog box (add list), you can move the target 
layer to the add list or elect to not move the target layer to the list. For example, if you have Text as 
a target layer where you want to merge Text02 and Text03 together with Text, you can add Text to 
the center window or not add Text to the list. When you select Text as the target layer and click OK, 
Text01 and Text 02 are added to Text regardless of whether Text was added to the center column.
TIP
TIP
If you want to merge a group of layers to a new layer name, you can edit the name 
of one of the layers to be merged in the Layers panel. Click, and click again, on the 
layer name in the Layers panel to edit the layer name. Open the Merge Layers dialog box and 
merge the desired layers to the new target layer name.
Flattening layers
Users of Acrobat Pro and Acrobat Pro Extended can flatten a group of layers or all layers in a PDF 
document into a single layer. Neither the merging layers option discussed earlier nor the flattening 

833
Working with Layers
24
layers option is available to Acrobat Standard users. You may want to flatten layers to simplify 
printing a document, exchange a PDF with users of an Acrobat viewer earlier than version 6, or 
reduce the file size. When layers are flattened, the layer visibility is taken into account. If you have 
four layers and two layers are visible, the flattened PDF document results as a combination of the 
visible layers only. Be certain about what layer data you want to remain visible before selecting the 
Options menu and choosing Flatten Layers, as you won’t be able to undo the operation and regain 
the data that was discarded from the hidden layers.
TIP
TIP
A good use for merging layers is when creating graphically rich Acrobat PDF forms. 
If you use the Add or Edit Fields command to populate a form in Acrobat, the fields 
most often won’t be picked up when Acrobat auto detects fields on forms where the form design 
uses beveled field boxes, gradients, drop shadows, and other similar graphic elements. To opti-
mize your chances for using auto field detection you can create a temporary layer (in a program 
like Adobe InDesign) for designing the field locations with simple field objects such as boxes 
and underlines that are easily picked up by Acrobat. After adding fields, hide the temporary layer 
and flatten the layers.

Creating New Layers in PDF Files
Acrobat 9 provides you some new features for handling layers in an area you just might not first 
notice when you start using the program. Open any flat PDF file — one without layers or even a 
layered file. Open a context menu on the Acrobat Toolbar Well and choose Print Production to 
open the Print Production toolbar shown in Figure 24.8.

Click the arrow adjacent to Create PDF layers and five options for creating layers appear in an expanded list.
The options shown in the Preflight window should be self-explanatory. If you want to create a 
layered document with vector objects, text, and images appearing on their own layers, choose 
the first item in the list (Create separate layers for vector objects, text, and images) then click the 
Analyze and Fix button in the lower right corner of the Preflight window. In an instant, your PDF 
document is converted to a PDF with Adobe PDF Layers. Click the Layers panel button in the 
Navigation pane and you’ll see layers with default names such as Images, Text, and Vector objects.

If you want to add content to a PDF document as a separate layer, you’ll find a new 
command in Acrobat 9 in the Layers panel. From the Options menu in the Layers

a file in a layered document, you have choices for importing the new data on an existing layer or as 
a new layer.

For more information on creating Button form fields, see Chapter 34.
Adding field objects has changed quite a bit in Acrobat 9. When you want to add a field object 
such as a text field, you first need to choose Forms ➪ Add or Edit Fields. This action moves you 
into Form Editing Mode and the interface changes as you see in Figure 24.11.

 FIGURE 24.11
The Form Editing Mode in Acrobat 9
To add a field object to a page you can open the Add New Field menu (top-left corner), open a 
context menu, or choose Forms ➪ Form Tools and choose a tool from the submenu. Once the cur-
sor is loaded, you can click the mouse button to drop a field object on the page or click and drag 
to set the field bounding box.
Adjusting properties can be handled in Form Edit Mode or the Acrobat view that you can return to 
by clicking Close Form Editing in the top-right corner of the window. In regard to changing layer 
visibility, it’s a better choice to create the field object and do the rest of your editing back in the 
Acrobat Viewer mode. While in Form Edit Mode you don’t have access to the Navigation panels, 
so changing layer visibility is not possible while in this mode.
The one form tool you do have access to in Viewer mode is the Button tool that appears on the 
Advanced Editing toolbar. You can stay in Viewer mode and add button fields that you can use to 
change layer visibility.

837

Create a button field in Viewer mode by clicking the Button tool in the Advanced Editing toolbar 
and click on the page where you want the field to appear. Click Show All Properties to open the 
Properties window. At this point you can change the layer view while the Properties dialog box is 
open. Choose the target view you want and click the Actions tab in the Field Properties. Choose 
Set Layer Visibility from the Select Action menu and click Add (see Figure 24.12). The button is 
now configured to display the view you see in the Layers panel.

If you want more control for working with layers such as creating layers in existing

working with layers. Plug-ins such as ARTS PDF Stratify extend the editing of PDF documents 
with features not supported in Acrobat. Search the Internet for tools that work with PDF layers 
or visit www.artspdf.com/arts_pdf_stratify.asp for more on ARTS PDF Stratify.

Changing layer visibility with JavaScripts
If you set a button action to change visibility in the Actions tab in the Button Properties dialog box, 
you must be able to see the button on the layer where you create the button and the layer for the 
target view. If you select a button to edit the properties and change the view to the target view for 
the button action, the button must still be visible to set the action.
Having buttons in view on all layers is not a problem when you add button fields to a PDF in 
Acrobat. All field objects and other types of annotation objects are visible on all layers regardless 
of the layer on which you create the object. However, there is one application that upsets the PDF 
applecart. Buttons created in Adobe InDesign are visible only on the layer where they were created. 
When you export to PDF, you’ll see the InDesign buttons appear on a layer when it is visible. 
Hiding the layer also hides the button.
With Adobe InDesign buttons, the problem becomes setting an action to show the target layer. 
You cannot use the Set Layer Visibility action in the Button Properties dialog box to change layer 
visibility with buttons that were created in InDesign. If you select the button and change a layer 
view, the button hides and therefore no action can be assigned to the button.
To work around the problem, you need to use a JavaScript. Rather than use the Set Layer Visibility 
action in the Button Properties dialog box, choose Run a JavaScript and click the Add button to 
open the JavaScript Editor. In the JavaScript Editor ,you might use a script as follows to change the 
OCG (layer) state:
var docOCGs = this.getOCGs();
for (var i=0; i < docOCGs.length; i++) 
{
 
if(docOCGs[i].name == “Video”)
 
{
 
 
docOCGs[i].state = !docOCGs[i].state;
 
}
 
if(docOCGs[i].name == “Content”)
 
{
 
 
docOCGs[i].state = docOCGs[i].state.off;
 
}
}
The above script changes OCG states between the “Video” and “Content” layers in the PDF docu-
ment. To see a sample of this script in action and examine buttons that were originally created in 
Adobe InDesign, take a look at the file videoLayers.pdf on the CD-ROM accompanying this 
book. The Play button shown in Figure 24.13 contains the script described above.

Some Practical Uses for Layered PDFs
I talked about using Adobe PDF Layers for multilingual documents earlier in this chapter as one 
good example for why you might want to use layers in PDFs. Other uses for working with PDFs 
are limited only by your imagination. You can vastly expand your imagination and use Adobe PDF 
layers in a number of ways.
On the CD-ROM accompanying this book you’ll find a few files with Adobe PDF layers. The video-
Layers.pdf document changes the layer state to open a layer where a video is played.
The AUC_regForm.pdf document is an Acrobat PDF form. Click the item denoted as 
LOCATION MAP shown in Figure 24.14 and the layer state changes to view a map of a convention 
site. Click the Show Stage button on the new layer view and a Flash animation explodes a seating 
chart. This kind of form is but one example of creating more dynamic interactive forms using 
Acrobat and Adobe PDF layers.

The file 101FormseTips.pdf is contained in the Chapter 24 folder on the CD-ROM. Open page 
two and you see a license agreement. If you click the Agree button all pages are made visible. The 
Agree button has a JavaScript that changes the OCG state to view the hidden layer. In this example 
you are shown how a license agreement can be added to a PDF where a user must agree to the 
terms of the agreement in order to see the PDF content.
The 101FormseTips.pdf document is not secured to provide you access to the PDF content. In 
a real-world situation you might secure the file against any kind of editing so users won’t be able to 
change layer visibility via the Layers panel, thereby bypassing the license agreement. Note that in 
the Layers Properties both layers are Locked, meaning a user can’t change visibility by clicking on 
the eye icons in the Layers panel.

Summary
 The PDF 1.5 and above formats support layers from authoring applications that are capa-
ble of creating layered files and exporting with Acrobat 6 or greater compatibility.
 You can view and hide individual layers in Acrobat. The initial visibility of the layers in 
view and what layers are hidden are determined at the time the PDF is created.

841
Working with Layers
24
 Saving files after showing and hiding layers does not change initial visibility. You change 
initial visibility in the Layer Properties dialog box, where you toggle layers on and off.
 You change layer states for visibility, printing, and exporting data in the Layer properties. 
Layers can be printed or exported without visibility.
 You merge and flatten layers using menu commands from the Options pull-down menu 
in the Layers panel.
 You can create link buttons to display different layer visibility. To create a link action to a 
view, you first create the desired view in the Layers panel and then set the link action in 
the Link or Button Properties dialog box.

A
dobe Acrobat 9 is compliant with United States federal code regulat-
ing document accessibility for vision- and motion-challenged per-
sons. This means that screen readers can intelligently interpret the 
PDFs you create; in other words, PDF files can be read aloud in a reading 
order as a sighted person would read a document. Through an extensive set 
of keyboard shortcuts available in Acrobat, almost anyone with vision or 
motion challenges can share your documents and read them.
In order for a document to be accessible, you must use authoring applica-
tions capable of delivering a document’s structure to Acrobat. Hence, you 
need to know something about the internal structure of documents and what 
programs to use to create the structure required by Acrobat to make a docu-
ment accessible. Not all the content in a document travels through the PDF 
creation process with information necessary to make a document completely 
accessible. Therefore, you need to perform some work in Acrobat to either 
add accessibility or to polish up a document for delivery to a screen reader in 
a form that makes sense to the user. In this chapter, I cover how to make 
documents accessible from authoring programs, as well as how to use 
Acrobat tools to make existing documents accessible.
Setting Up the Work 
Environment
The essential tools for working with document accessibility include the Tags 
panel, Content panel, and Order panel. To view the panels, you need to have 
a document open in Acrobat. When you start working with accessibility in a 
document, select View ➪ Navigation Panels ➪ Tags. The Tags panel opens in

a panel that also includes the Content, Order, and tabs. You can drag the tab for each panel to the 
Navigation pane to dock it among the other tabs in the “‘free” or “open”’ region below the 
Signatures panel and above the Comments tab. Click the Close box in the top-right corner of the 
palette to close the palette containing the
The TouchUp tools are important not only for editing text and objects, but the TouchUp Reading 
Order tool was specifically designed to work with reading order on accessible documents. Be cer-
tain to load the TouchUp tools. Select Tools ➪ Customize Toolbars or open a context menu on the 
Toolbar Well and select More tools. Check the check box in the Advanced Editing toolbar for 
TouchUp Reading Order Tool. Pick and choose other tools in this toolbar you expect to use, and 
click OK. To dock the toolbars, select Dock All Toolbars from a context menu opened from the 
Toolbar Well.
Creating Accessible Documents
The terms “document accessibility,” “structure,” and “tagged PDFs” may be a mystery to you. If the 
term “accessibility” is new, then you need to begin with an understanding of what accessible docu-
ments are before working with them. After you know more about document accessibility, you can 
move forward to look at how to create an accessible document, and then look at how you can edit 
accessible documents. Therefore, the three areas to work with are understanding accessibility, cre-
ating accessible documents from authoring programs, and finally, working with accessible docu-
ments in Acrobat.
Screen Readers
I 
use the term “screen reader” extensively in this chapter. When I use this term, I’m referring to tools 
created by third parties to read open documents aloud in Acrobat and other programs or from files 
in various formats saved to disk.
Screen readers range in price from $99 to over $1,000. The advantage of using third-party products 
with Acrobat PDF files is that they can read aloud single words as well as spell out words character 
by character. Through keyboard controls, users choose reading rates, audio output levels, voices, 
and navigation.
Screen readers are typically software programs installed on either Mac OS or Windows. More pro-
grams support Windows than Macintosh operating systems, but developers have been increasing 
their support for both platforms. The most popular screen reader used today is Freedom Scientific 
JAWS for Windows. Version 4.5 and later is also compatible with Flash Player 6 and later. In past 
years, PDF documents were not supported by many developers. Today, much more support exists 
for reading PDF documents with the Adobe Reader software.
For a complete list of screen readers that have been tested with Acrobat, log on to Adobe’s Web site 
at www.adobe.com/accessibility. From Adobe’s Web page you’ll find URL links to vendor 
sites as well as general information about accessibility.

Accessibility and Tagged PDF Files

Understanding accessibility
Sighted people can view a document on the computer or read a printed page and easily discern the 
difference between titles, subtitles, columns, graphic images, graphic elements, and so on. With 
regard to Acrobat PDFs, you can easily see the difference between background designs, button 
links, bookmarks, animation, and form fields, and you typically see visual clues to know where 
buttons and fields exist.
With regard to screen-reading devices, which depend on software to generate audio output from an 
Acrobat PDF file, the software readers aren’t intelligent enough to distinguish differences based on 
visual clues. For example, a screen reader may interpret a three-columned document as one continu-
ous column and read the text from left to right across all three columns row by row. Obviously the 
output is useless to the end user working with a screen reader. Screen readers interpret headings, 
subheadings, and tables the same as body copy, and they offer no distinction in the structure unless 
the screen reader software has some clue that these items are different from the body text.
Some authoring programs provide you an opportunity when creating the PDF file to retain the 
underlying structure of a document in the resulting PDF file. With a series of tags and retention of 
the document structure, screen readers use alternate text to make distinctions in the document 
much like the visual user would interpret a page. The document flow, alternate text for graphic 
elements, distinctions between headings, and so on, can all be managed in Acrobat when the inter-
nal document structural tree is included in the PDF export. When files are not exported with the 
document structure, you can use Acrobat commands to add structure to PDFs. In order to make it 
possible for people with screen readers to navigate your PDF documents correctly, the underlying 
structure must be present.
PDF files fall into three categories when you are talking about a document’s structure:
 Unstructured PDF files. Unstructured PDF documents could not be interpreted by screen 
readers with complete document integrity in earlier versions of Acrobat. For example, when 
you exported the PDF to other formats such as a Rich Text Format (RTF), the basic paragraph 
structure was preserved, but tables, lists, and some text formatting were lost. In Acrobat 8 and 
above, unstructured documents can be interpreted by screen readers with accuracy. What 
remains as an unstructured document when using Acrobat 8 and 9 are image files converted 
to PDF such as scanned documents. These files clearly are not structured.
 Structured PDF files. Structured PDF files can be read by screen readers, but the reli-
ability is much less than the next category of tagged PDF documents. When you export 
structured PDF files to other formats, more structural content is preserved, but tables and 
lists can be lost. Additionally, structured documents, such as the unstructured documents 
discussed previously, do not support text reflows for different-sized devices.
 Tagged PDF files. Tagged PDFs contain both the document structure and a hierarchical 
structure tree where all the internal structure about the document’s content is interpreted. 
Tagged PDFs have the highest reliability when you’re repurposing files for screen reader 
output and saving files in other formats such as RTF, HTML, XHTML, and XML. In addi-
tion, tagged PDF files support text reflow for viewing on different-sized screens and 
devices and accommodate any zoom level on a monitor.

NOTE
NOTE
Structured documents were introduced with Acrobat 4 (PDF 1.3) and tagged docu-
ments were introduced with Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4). PDFs created prior to version 1.3 
had no document structure, and PDFs created before version 1.4 could not be tagged. With later 
versions of Acrobat, document structure and tagging could be added to these PDFs from within 
Acrobat.
The goal for you when creating PDF documents for accessibility is to be certain you use PDF docu-
ments that are not only structured, but also tagged. After you create tagged PDFs, you can work 
with the structure tree and modify the contents for optimum use. In terms of making Acrobat 
PDFs accessible, you must consider several criteria to optimize files for effective handling by screen 
readers:
 Assessing accessibility. Fortunately, Acrobat provides tools for determining whether a 
PDF file is an accessible document. As a first order of business you should plan on assess-
ing a file for accessibility. If you work with legacy files or files that are created from 
authoring programs that don’t support the export of the document structure, be certain 
to make the document accessible before beginning an editing session.

For adding accessibility to PDF files from within Acrobat, see the section “Making 
existing PDFs accessible” later in this chapter.
 Logical reading order. The text should follow a logical flow. You need to properly define 
column text in terms of the path that a screen reader follows (that is, down one column, 
then begin at the top of the second column, and so on). You should also mark headings 
and subheadings for distinction.
 Alternative text descriptions for image and graphic elements. Those familiar with 
HTML know that you can code an HTML document with alternate tags so users with 
text-only browsers can understand the structure of Web pages. The same principle for 
accessible documents applies. Alternate text needs to be inserted so the screen reader can 
interpret graphic elements.
 Form field descriptions. Form fields need to be described with text to inform a user 
with a screen reader that a form field is present.
 Field tab order. Setting the logical tab order for fields on a form is important for the 
visual user. With screen readers it is essential. The logical tab order for fields should be 
strictly followed.
 Document security. If documents are secured with Acrobat security, you must use 128-
bit encryption compatible with Acrobat 5 and above. If you use compatibility less than 
Acrobat 5 or 40-bit encryption, the PDF is rendered inaccessible.
 Links and interactivity. Use form fields for link buttons with descriptions so the user 
knows that another destination or a link action is invoked if he or she selects the field.

 Document language. Screen readers typically deliver accessible documents in only one 
language. To protect your documents against inoperability with new releases, specify a 
document language when creating accessible PDFs. Document language specification is 
also important when using tools in Acrobat for checking accessibility.

document security, see Chapter 26. For more information on links and interactivity, 
see Chapter 22.
Adding accessibility in authoring applications
Not all authoring programs currently support accessibility. This phenomenon may change with 
new upgrades to software, so what is said today may change tomorrow. As of this writing the pro-
grams offering the best support for document accessibility include Microsoft Word version 2000 or 
higher, Adobe PageMaker 7.0 or higher, Adobe FrameMaker, Adobe LiveCycle Designer, and 
Adobe InDesign 2.0 or higher. If you use other authoring applications, you do have the option to 
make documents accessible with Acrobat Standard and Acrobat Pro, or Acrobat Pro Extended.
When converting Microsoft Word files to PDF, be certain to use the PDFMaker in the Word toolbar or 
from the Adobe PDF menu in Word. Set up the conversion settings for enabling accessibility and reflow 
with tagged PDF documents. This option is available in the Settings tab in the Acrobat PDFMaker dialog 
box. Select the “Enable Accessibility and Reflow with tagged Adobe PDF” check box.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more on creating PDF files with accessibility and tags from Microsoft Office 
applications, see Chapter 8.
When creating documents with text, images, charts, diagrams, and so on, using a professional lay-
out program often works better than a word processor. Adobe InDesign CS is an ideal tool for cre-
ating layouts that you need to make accessible. When you design a document for accessibility, be 
precise about how you add elements on each page. The order in which you lay out documents can 
have an effect on the order of the exported structure. For example, adding a block of text, and then 
importing an image, may result in the text appearing first in the structure tree and the image fol-
lowing the text even if you move the elements so the image appears first on the page. The only way 
to observe the results of how the document structure ultimately converts to PDF is to practice and 
examine the tags structure tree in Acrobat versus your layouts. You can develop a workflow that 
minimizes the work in Acrobat to properly create the structure needed for optimum performance 
when read by a screen reader.
TIP
TIP
If you arrange objects in an authoring program like Adobe InDesign and the reading 
order is not following the viewing order, you can cut either text or images and paste 
them back into the document. If, for example, an image should be first in the structure tree fol-
lowed by text, but the order is reversed when you examine the tags in Acrobat, cut the text block 
and paste it back into the document in InDesign. Recreate the PDF and you’ll find the order 
changed according to the order that the elements were last placed on the page. This method is not 
always a precise solution for reordering elements, but it can often be used to resolve problems.

Part IV
Making existing PDFs accessible
If you have PDF documents either from legacy files or from files converted from authoring applica-
tions that do not support exports to PDF with tags, you can use Acrobat commands to add struc-
ture to the document and make the files accessible. The first step is checking a document for 
accessibility. If the document contains no tags, then you can add tags in Acrobat Standard or 
Acrobat Pro, or Pro Extended.
Performing a Quick Check
To determine whether a document is accessible, you can perform a Quick Check. In Acrobat 
Standard, Acrobat Pro, or Acrobat Pro Extended choose Advanced ➪ Accessibility ➪ Quick Check 
(or press Shift+Ctrl/Ô+6). In Adobe Reader, choose Document ➪ Accessibility Quick Check (or 
press Shift+Ctrl/Ô+6). This method of checking the PDF is a quick analysis to determine whether 
tags exist in the file. When the check is completed, a dialog box opens informing you of the acces-
sibility status. If the document is not accessible, the dialog box message states that the document is 
not structured and reading problems may occur.
NOTE
NOTE
Document accessibility can be checked in Adobe Reader. Making a document 
accessible, however, requires Acrobat Standard or Acrobat Pro, or Pro extended.
Performing a Full Check (Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended only)
Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended offer you a more sophisticated analysis, where more file attributes 
are checked and a report is created either in a file or by adding comments to the open PDF docu-
ment, or both. To use the Full Check option, follow these steps.
STEPS: Checking accessibility in Acrobat Professional
 
1. Choose Advanced ➪ Accessibility ➪ Full Check. The Accessibility Full Check dialog 
box, shown in Figure 25.1, opens.
 
2. Check the box for Create Accessibility Report and Create comments in document. 
Checking these boxes creates a report and adds comment notes in the document pertain-
ing to the results of the analysis. All errors found during the check are reported in com-
ment notes.
 
3. Select the Checking Options for the items you want to check. Enable the check boxes 
in this section for items you want to check. In this example I selected all the check boxes.
 
4. Click the Browse button. Identify the location for the report file if you want a report 
saved to an HTML file, which you can view in the Accessibility Report panel (see 
Figure 25.2).
 
5. When you set all the attributes, click Start Checking. Acrobat opens a dialog box sim-
ilar to Figure 25.2, reporting the findings.

Part IV
After completing the check, the Accessibility Report panel opens and displays a more detailed 
report as shown in Figure 25.3. If you selected Create comments in document, comment notes 
may appear, reporting problems in untagged documents.
 FIGURE 25.3
The Accessibility Report panel shows you a detailed report of the full accessibility check findings.
An Accessibility report is also saved to your hard drive in HTML format. If you click the Browse 
button in the Accessibility Full Check dialog box, you can target a location for the saved report. By 
default, the report is saved to your My Documents folder (Windows) or your Documents folder 
(Macintosh). Open your Web browser and select File Open. Navigate to the folder where the 
report is found and open the file. The report is displayed in the browser window.
The links in the HTML document link directly to the PDF file and highlight the item associated 
with the link. Click a link in your Web browser and the PDF file opens in the foreground with the 
respective item highlighted, as shown in Figure 25.4. You can correct problems by clicking links in 
the Web browser and correcting the problems in the PDF document.

Adding accessibility
Keep in mind you are always best served by adding accessibility at the time a PDF document is cre-
ated from authoring programs supporting exports to PDF with accessibility and tags. If you have 
files for which either returning to the authoring program is impractical or the authoring program is 
incapable of exporting to PDF as tagged files, choose Advanced ➪ Accessibility ➪ Add Tags to 
Document. Or from the Tags panel in the Navigation pane, select Add Tags to Document from the 
Options pull-down menu. Immediately after you select the menu command from either Acrobat 
Standard or Acrobat Professional, a slider bar opens displaying Acrobat’s progress in adding tags to 
the document. After completion, no confirmation dialog box opens to report the status. If prob-
lems were encountered while adding the tags, a dialog box opens, reporting the problems found.
After adding the tags, you can return to the Quick Check or Full Check menu command and 
check the document for accessibility.
If a file has tags and you choose Advanced ➪ Accessibility ➪ Add Tags to Document, Acrobat opens 
a dialog box informing you that the file already has tags. Adding tags is not permitted using the 
menu command. If you are unhappy with the current tagging, you can remove all tags from the 
document, and then reapply with this method. To remove all tags, open the Tags panel in the 
Navigation pane. Select the topmost tag (typically labeled “Tags”) and select Delete Tag from the 
Options pull-down menu.
Understanding Structure
To understand more clearly the need for creating accessibility and adding tags to a document, look 
at Figure 25.5 as an example. This document contains several items that need attention to make 
the file accessible and comprehensible when read by a screen reader.

852
PDF Interactivity
Part IV
 FIGURE 25.5
A document with images, illustrations, and text in multiple columns needs to have the structure modified 
for proper reading by a screen reader.
In Figure 25.5 the items of importance in terms of accessibility include the following:
 The first element on the page is a logo. A screen reader won’t interpret the logo unless 
you add some alternate text to the document describing the object. Adjacent to the logo 
on the right side is text that a screen reader can read after you make the document acces-
sible. If the text does not read properly, the two lines of text need to be modified for the 
proper interpretation by the screen reader.
 The two lines of text are in a single column. These lines should be read in logical order 
without any problems. They are shown here to illustrate the difference between the two 
lines and the two columns following.
 The text is blocked in two columns. Unless the structure is established for the screen 
reader to read down one column before moving to the second column, the screen reader 
defaults at a left-to-right reading order, reading across both columns.
 Item four is a large map. Alternate text for the illustration is needed for the screen 
reader to explain what graphic appears on the page.

853
Accessibility and Tagged PDF Files
25
 Item five is an inset photo. The alternate text for the map can describe the photo, or the 
photo can have an alternate text description. Either way, you need to create the alternate 
text for the screen reader to fully interpret the graphics.
When you export to PDF from authoring programs with tags, the structure of the document for the 
blocks of text in logical reading orders is preserved. In the example in Figure 25.5, the single and 
double-column text is typically not a problem when the file is read by a screen reader. Images, how-
ever, need some form of manual editing. Even the best source exporting with tags wouldn’t be able to 
describe the visual elements in the layout. These are subjective items that need a description.
If using a program such as Microsoft Word, you can add alternate text in Word before the file is 
exported to PDF. In other applications you need to create the alternate text in Acrobat.
Using the Tags panel
When you export a document from an authoring program with tags or use the Add Tags to 
Document menu command, a structure tree is created in the PDF file. The structure tree is a hierar-
chical order of the elements contained in the file. Elements may be in the form of heads, subheads, 
body text, figures, tables, annotations, and other items identified as separate individual structural 
elements. The hierarchy contains a nested order of the elements with parent/child relationships. A 
heading, for example, may have a subhead. The heading in this case is a parent element with the 
subheading a child element.
When a document contains tags, you view the tag elements and the structure tree in the Tags 
panel. Open the Tags panel and click on the top item. By default, you see an icon labeled Tags 
with a plus (+) (Windows) or right-pointing arrow (Macintosh) symbol adjacent to it. Click the 
symbol and you open the tree at one level. Other child elements are nested below.
The Tags panel may have an extensive list of elements depending on your document length and 
complexity. If you want to edit an element or find it in the document, you need some help from 
Acrobat to find out exactly what tag in the Tags panel is related to what element on a given page. 
The help comes in the form of a menu command in the Tags panel. Click the down-pointing arrow 
adjacent to Options in the Tags panel and select Highlight Content. The content is highlighted as 
shown earlier in Figure 25.5.
When you return to the structure tree, the items you select are highlighted on the respective ele-
ments on pages in the Document pane. Click an element and Acrobat navigates to the page where 
the content is located. The object is highlighted with a keyline border, as shown in Figure 25.5.

854
PDF Interactivity
Part IV
Adding alternate text
In the example in Figure 25.5, the logo appearing at the top of the page is an image file. When a 
screen reader reads the document, no specific instructions are contained in the document to inter-
pret this image. As an option, you can create alternate text so a visually challenged person knows a 
graphic element exists on the page. To add alternate text in a tagged PDF document, follow these 
steps.
STEPS: Adding alternate text to tagged elements
 
1. Open a tagged PDF file. Or add tags to a document. Open the Tags panel in the 
Navigation pane. Note: If you didn’t set up the working environment as described in the 
beginning of the chapter, choose View ➪ Navigation Panels ➪ Tags to open the Tags 
panel.
 
2. Open the structure tree. Click the Tags Root icon to the left of the text. On Windows a 
plus (+) symbol appears adjacent to the text. On the Macintosh, a right-pointing arrow 
appears next to the text. Clicking the icon opens the tags tree.
 
3. Select Highlight Content. If you haven’t selected the menu command for highlighting 
content, open the Options palette in the Tags panel and select Highlight Content.
 
4. Find the element for which the alternate text is to be added. In this example, the fig-
ure below the second paragraph (<P>) was selected. When you click the Figure tag, the 
logo at the top left corner of the page is highlighted. Alternately, you can also select the 
TouchUp Object tool, click an object on the page, and select Find Tag from Selection 
from the Tags palette Options pull-down menu.
 
5. Open the element’s properties. Select the TouchUp Object tool from the Advanced 
Editing toolbar you opened earlier. If you do not have this tool available, choose 
Tools ➪ Advanced Editing ➪ TouchUp Object Tool. Click the element and open a context 
menu. Select Properties from the menu options.
 
6. Add alternate text. Click the Tags panel. Add a title for the tag by typing a title in the 
Title field box. The title is not necessary for, nor read by, the screen reader. Add the text 
you want the screen reader to read out loud in the Alternate Text field. Select the pull-
down menu for Language and select a language. The edits made in this example are 
shown in Figure 25.6.
 
7. Close the TouchUp Properties dialog box.

855
Accessibility and Tagged PDF Files
25
 FIGURE 25.6
Fill in the fields for a title and alternate text, and select a language in the TouchUp 
Properties dialog box.
Using the Content tab
The Content tab contains a hierarchical list of the objects in the PDF file. Objects are listed in the 
order in which they appear on the page, similar to the logical structure tree in the Tags panel. 
Click the Content tab to open it in the Navigation pane and you see a view similar to Figure 25.7. 
Click an object and move it up or down to change the order of the objects.
The Content tab can be helpful when you want to navigate to and highlight a content item listed in 
the tab. Click an item such as a text item or figure and the page appears in the Document pane 
with the respective item selected.
In addition to physically reordering objects, a number of menu commands are available from the 
Options pull-down menu. Among the menu commands is an option to create a New Container. 
Notice in Figure 25.5 that all the tags are nested within containers. You can select a tag and select 
New Container to add alternate text to any area in the document.

856
PDF Interactivity
Part IV
 FIGURE 25.7
Click objects and drag up or down to reorder the objects in the Content pane.
Using the Order tab
You use the Order tab to correct reading order problems. After you create a tagged PDF document, 
Acrobat infers the reading order from the document structure. You may need to change the order 
for text and images to create a more logical flow in the document.
 
 You use the Order tab in conjunction with the TouchUp Reading Order tool. Select the tool and 
open the Order tab. Acrobat lists the reading order of the elements according to page as shown in 
Figure 25.8. To reorder the elements or regions, click and drag a tag up or down to change the 
reading order. Each tagged object is numbered on a page indicating the order the tags are read. 
From the Touchup Reading Order dialog box you can change the attributes of tags and renumber 
them to change the reading order. Figure 25.8 shows the tagged elements and the reading order 
defined by numbers adjacent to each tagged object.

857
Accessibility and Tagged PDF Files
25
 FIGURE 25.8
To change reading order, click and drag tags up or down in the Order tab.
Checking accessible tags
You can check your work easily in Acrobat by having Acrobat read the document. Choose 
View ➪ Read Out Loud ➪ Activate Read Out Loud. Return to the same menu and choose Read This 
Page Only. The default text-to-speech voice installed on your computer reads the text as a screen 
reader would interpret it. If you prepare files for screen readers, you can use Acrobat’s built-in 
reading engine to read aloud the text in the document and the alternate tags you add to the file.
Although the Read Out Loud menu command is not intended to replace screen readers, the feature 
in all Acrobat viewers offers you a good means for checking files that meet accessible standards.
TIP
TIP
You can save PDF files as accessible text. Select File ➪ Save As and select Text 
(Accessible).txt from the Save as Type (Windows) or Format (Macintosh) pull-down 
menu. The saved text is saved in the same reading order as when you read a document aloud.

Part IV
In addition to using Acrobat’s built-in function for reading documents aloud, you can acquire a 
low-cost plug-in from a third-party developer without purchasing a screen reader. PDFAloud, mar-
keted by textHELP Systems (www.texthelp.com), is more robust than Acrobat’s Read Out Loud 
command. With PDFAloud you can read text a word, sentence, or paragraph at a time. The plug-
in also offers you synchronized colored highlighting while the text is read.
Viewing Accessible Documents
Some accessibility requirements extend beyond text-to-speech reading. Individuals with assistive 
devices for visual impairments can view documents when text is zoomed and when text color sig-
nificantly contrasts with background colors. You can modify the display of documents on your 
screen by adjusting preferences for Accessibility in the Preferences dialog box, or you can custom-
ize viewing by choosing Advanced ➪ Accessibility ➪ Setup Assistant (in Adobe Reader, select 
Document ➪ Accessibility Setup Assistant), which opens the Accessibility Setup Assistant dialog 
box, shown in Figure 25.9.
 FIGURE 25.9
The Accessibility Setup Assistant contains options for screen displays and reading orders.
You make attribute choices in a pane and click the Next button to advance through the 
Accessibility Setup Assistant. You can make choices for color displays, text smoothing, zoom dis-
plays, reading orders, and page delivery by moving through the panes. When you finish, these 
selections will be set in the Accessibility Preferences for you.

A
crobat PDF documents can be secured using a host of different security 
methods and encryption tools to prevent unauthorized users from open-
ing files and changing documents. Acrobat Security combined with digital 
signatures enables you to protect data and secure files for just about any purpose. 
There’s much to learn about using Acrobat Security and digital signatures, and it’s 
important to know what levels of security are available to you and what kinds of 
security you can apply in many different circumstances. This chapter covers a 
broad description of security and digitally signing PDF documents and the meth-
ods you use to protect files against unauthorized viewing and editing.
Setting Up the Work 
Environment
You add security to a PDF document through menu commands and the 
Secure Task button that appears in the Tasks toolbar when you return to the 
default view. If all you want to do is add security to PDFs, you can open a 
context menu and select Reset Toolbars from the menu options.
If you want to add digital signature fields on a form where users can digitally 
sign documents, you need to use Form Edit mode or use a document created 
in Adobe LiveCycle Designer that contains signature fields. Documents can 
be signed without using signature fields, but when you want to add a field 
for signing the document, you’ll want to work on a form created in Adobe 
Designer with signature fields or add signature fields in the Form Edit mode. 
Adding signature fields doesn’t require loading any tools; however, the Select 
Object tool in the Advanced Editing toolbar can be helpful. From a context 
menu opened on the Toolbar Well, select the Advanced Editing toolbar. 
Dock the toolbar after loading it.

Restricting the Opening and 
Editing of Files
Acrobat security comes in many different forms, allowing you to secure PDF files against user 
viewing and/or editing in many ways based on the level of security you assign to a PDF document. 
However, depending on what level of security you apply to a file, the document may or may not be 
able to be opened by users of earlier versions of Acrobat. Therefore, when you add security it is 
critical to know your audience and what versions of Acrobat they are using to view files.
Methods of security available in Acrobat include three types of restrictions. You can secure a file 
against opening and editing by using Password Security at different levels of encryption. You can 
also secure files using public key certificates, or if your organization is using Adobe LiveCycle 
Rights Management Server, you can apply security policies from there. You should think of the 
first method (Password Security) as security you might apply globally to PDFs when you want the 
public to have a password to open your PDFs or you want to restrict certain Acrobat features, such 
as content editing or printing. In this regard, you secure documents for what is referred to as 
unknown users. You can further delineate securing individual files into two categories. You can 
secure documents by applying security settings that you select via options in security windows, or 
you can create a security policy in which the same level of security and encryption attributes are 
applied to documents each time you secure files.
Think of the second method (Certificate Security) as restrictions you want to apply for a selected 
group of people, or what are referred to as known users. You might want to restrict opening docu-
ments or PDF editing to a group of co-workers, colleagues, or individuals with whom you have 
direct communication. This method requires the use of digital IDs and public key certificates. This 
form of security also uses a security policy you create from public key certificates derived from 
users’ digital IDs.
The third method is securing files with the Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management Server. Adobe 
LiveCycle Rights Management as a product is not covered in this book; see the Acrobat Help Guide 
for more details or information. Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management Server enables you to apply 
server-based security policies to PDF documents. One of the great benefits for using a policy server 
is that you can encrypt documents for limited time use.
Keep in mind that Security Policies can be used with either Password Security or Certificate 
Security.
The discussion on Acrobat Security starts with the first method of applying security for a more 
global environment of unknown users. Later in this chapter, encryption using a security policy 
with public key certificates for known users is covered along with digital signatures.

Using password security
To secure an open document, choose File ➪ Properties. Click the Security tab in the Document 
Properties dialog box. Notice the Security Method pull-down menu. Four options are listed in 
the menu for different security methods. The default selection is No Security. Open the pull-
down menu and select Password Security. The Password Security – Settings dialog box shown in 
Figure 26.1 opens. Depending on which compatibility option you select from the Compatibility 
pull-down menu, the bottom of the dialog box activates additional options or removes options. In 
Figure 26.1, you can see that when choosing Acrobat 9 compatibility, all options are available in 
the dialog box. If you select an earlier version, such as Acrobat 3 compatibility, some options are 
grayed out, such as two of the options in the Select Document Components to Encrypt section.
 FIGURE 26.1
Depending on what level of compatibility you choose, the options available for Password Security change.

At first glance you may not see any difference in the options for Acrobat 9 security 
compared to Acrobat 7 security. All the radio buttons and menu choices are the 
same for Acrobat 7, 8, and 9. However, take a look at the Encryption Level in Figure 26.1. 
Acrobat 7 and 8 security used 128-bit encryption. Acrobat 9 provides you with 256-bit encryption.

Creating a Policy for Adding Security
I
f you’ve used earlier versions of Acrobat, accessing the Document Properties dialog box is some-
thing you are probably familiar with. It’s a fast and easy way for adding document security, and 
it’s okay when you have a single document you want to secure and never again want to secure addi-
tional documents with the same permissions and restrictions. Since Acrobat 7, Adobe Systems has 
made securing PDF documents much easier when you want to routinely secure PDF files using the 
same permissions settings. The preferred method for securing files in Acrobat 7 through 9 is to create 
a security policy.
To create a security policy you use the Secure Task button pull-down menu and select Manage 
Security Policies or Advanced ➪ Security ➪ Manage Security Policies. Either choice opens a dialog 
box where you create a new policy. You step through a New Security Policy Wizard where you 
make choices for the security method you want to use and make choices for the permissions you 
want to assign to a document.
Once you create the policy, you can easily apply the same policy when you want to secure addi-
tional documents without the need to select the different permissions options each time you apply 
security. For more detailed information on creating and using security policies, see “Using a security 
policy” later in this chapter.
You add Password Security via this dialog box any time you want to restrict users from opening a file 
and/or making changes to the content. Users must know the password you add in this dialog box in 
order to open a file and/or make changes. The options available to you include the following:
 Compatibility. The options from this pull-down menu include Acrobat 3.0, Acrobat 5.0, 
Acrobat 6.0, Acrobat 7.0, and Acrobat 9.0 compatibility. If you select Acrobat 9.0 com-
patibility and save the PDF document, users need an Acrobat 9 viewer or greater to open 
the file. The same holds true when saving with Acrobat 7 compatibility. Users need 
Acrobat 7 or greater to view PDFs created with Acrobat 7 compatibility.
 Encryption level. Below the Compatibility pull-down menu, Acrobat informs you what 
level of encryption is applied to the document based on the compatibility choice made in 
the pull-down menu. If you select Acrobat 3 from the Compatibility pull-down menu, 
the encryption level is 40-bit encryption. Acrobat 5 and Acrobat 6 compatibility are 
encrypted with 128-bit RC4 encryption. Acrobat 7 and 8 supports 128-bit AES. Acrobat 
9.0 supports 256-bit AES. All the higher encryption levels offer you more options for 
restricting printing and editing.
 Encrypt all document contents. This option applies encryption to all document contents.
 Encrypt all document contents except metadata (Acrobat 6 and later compati-
ble). Use this option to apply encryption to all document contents except document 
metadata. As the item name implies, this level of security is compatible with Acrobat 6 
and later. This is a good selection if you want to have the metadata in your secure 
documents available for a search engine.

 Encrypt only file attachments (Acrobat 7 and later compatible). Use this option to 
encrypt file attachments but not the PDF document. This option is compatible only 
with Acrobat 7 and above. You might use this when sending an eEnvelope or a PDF 
Portfolio where you want to encrypt the contents only.
TIP
TIP
Encrypting only file attachments is a nifty feature that was introduced in Acrobat 7. 
As an example for using this feature, you might have a document such as a memo 
you want to distribute to all employees. Attached to the memo you might have a financial report, 
draft company policy document, or some other file you want to have reviewed by management 
personnel only. All company personnel can see the memo, but only those who have a security 
password can open the file attachments. You can likewise secure files in a PDF Portfolio. The 
entire portfolio, or individual files within the portfolio, can be secured.
 Require a password to open the document. Select this check box if you want a user to 
supply a password to open the PDF document. After selecting the check box, the field 
box for Document Open Password becomes active and you can add a password. Before 
you exit the dialog box, Acrobat prompts you in another dialog box to confirm the pass-
word. Note: if you select Encrypt only file attachments (Acrobat 7 and later compatible), 
you must enter a password to be able to open the attachment(s).
 Restrict editing and printing of the document. A password will be required in order 
to change these permission settings. Select this check box if you want to restrict per-
missions from the items active in the Permissions area of the dialog box. You can use this 
with or without a Document Open Password.
 Change Permissions Password. Fill in the field box with a password. If you also have a 
Document Open Password, the passwords must be different. Acrobat opens a dialog box 
and informs you to make different password choices if you attempt to use the same pass-
word for opening the file and setting permissions.
 Printing Allowed. If you use Acrobat 3 compatibility, the options are available to either 
enable printing or disallow printing. The choices are None and High Resolution. Even 
though the choice reads High Resolution, the result simply enables users to print your file. 
With Acrobat 5 and above compatibility, you have a third choice for enabling printing at a 
lower resolution (150 dpi). If you select Low Resolution (150 dpi) from the menu options, 
users are restricted to printing the file at the lower resolution. This choice is typically some-
thing you might use for files intended for digital prepress and high-end printing, eBooks or 
eContent, or to protect your content from being printed and then rescanned.
 Changes Allowed. From this pull-down menu you make choices for the kinds of 
changes you allow users to perform on the document. Acrobat 3 compatibility offers you 
four choices; Acrobat 5 and above compatibility offers you five choices. These options 
include the following:
 None. This option prevents a user from any kind of editing and content extraction.
 Inserting, deleting, and rotating pages. This option is not available when using 
Acrobat 3 compatibility. Users are permitted to insert, delete, and rotate pages. If you 
create PDFs for eBooks, allowing users to rotate pages can be helpful when they view 
PDFs on tablets and portable devices.

 Page layout, filling in forms, and signing existing signature fields (Acrobat 3 
only). Select this option to enable users to extract pages, insert pages, and also per-
form actions on form fields.
 Filling in form fields and signing existing signature fields. If you create Acrobat 
forms and want users to be able to fill in the form fields and digitally sign documents, 
enable this check box. Forms are useless to users without the ability to fill in the form 
fields.
 Commenting, filling in form fields, and signing existing signature fields. You 
might use this option in a review process where you want to have users comment on a 
design but you don’t want them to make changes to your file. You can secure the doc-
ument against editing, but allow commenting and form field filling in and signing. 
When you enable form filling in with this option or the Filling in form fields and sign-
ing existing signature fields option, users are restricted against changing your form 
design and cannot make edits other than filling in the fields. A good example of using 
this option might be having your customers fill out a form and also add comments to 
describe their selections.
 Any except extracting pages. With this option, all the permissions are available to 
users except extracting pages from the document and creating separate PDFs from 
selected pages.
 Enable copying of text, images, and other content and access for the visually 
impaired. This option is available when selecting Acrobat 3.0 and later. If you restrict 
permissions for any of the previous pull-down menu options, users aren’t allowed to 
copy data. You can add permission for content copying by enabling this check box. 
Enable copying of text, images, and other content: The setting above was replaced with 
two settings in Acrobat 5.0 and higher security. This setting restricts the user from copy-
ing information from your PDF.
 Enable text access for screen reader devices for the visually impaired. This option is 
available for all versions except Acrobat 3 compatibility. As a matter of practice, checking 
this box is always a good idea. If you check this box, you can restrict all editing features 
while permitting users with screen reading devices the ability to read your files. If the 
check box is not enabled, screen readers and other devices designed for accessibility are 
not able to read the PDF document and all the options for using the View ➪ Read Out 
Loud menu command are grayed out. Furthermore, users can index your files with 
Acrobat Pro by using Acrobat Catalog when this check box is enabled, regardless of the 
other items you prevent users from accessing.

information on creating index files, see Chapter 6.
After you make choices for the password permissions, click OK, click OK again in the Document 
Properties dialog box, and then save your file to apply the security. If you close the document 
without saving, the security settings are not applied.

Using a security policy
Security policies are settings you save that are later used when securing documents — similar to 
creating style sheets in word processors or layout programs. The three different options for creat-
ing a security policy are as follows:
 Use passwords. This option is the same as applying a password to a document via the 
Document Properties Security pane. The difference between applying password security 
in the Password Security – Settings dialog box shown in Figure 26.1 and adding a secu-
rity policy is that the latter is more efficient when you’re applying the same security set-
tings repeatedly to multiple documents. If you use the Password Security – Settings 
dialog box you need to set options each time you secure a document by selecting check 
boxes and making choices from pull-down menus. When you use a security policy, the 
options you choose are captured and saved as part of the policy; you just use the policy 
each time you want to encrypt documents with the same settings.
Understanding Password Encryption
W
hen you encrypt a file with password security, it’s important to understand that tools exist that 
can decrypt files. Just about anything that can be encrypted using a password can be broken 
given enough time with the right tools. Software applications used for decryption run through cycles 
combining different characters to arrive at the right combination that accesses the encrypted file.
If you use a three-character password, the amount of time to break your password by a sophisticated 
decryption tool might be a matter of a few hours. As you add characters to the password, the decryp-
tion tool requires more time to explore all combinations of characters. If you add 10 to 12 characters 
to a password, the most sophisticated tools on the fastest computers can take decades of constant 
running to come up with the right combination of characters to break a password.
As a matter of practice when assigning permissions for sensitive material, always use no fewer than 
eight characters to secure a file. Adobe Systems has provided a sophisticated tool that enables you 
to protect your content if you observe a few simple rules.
In Acrobat versions prior to 9.0, only roman characters were permitted for passwords. Languages such 
as Middle Eastern, Hebrew, and Asian character sets were left out. When using the new Acrobat 9 
encryption codes, you find full Unicode support and can encrypt PDF files using a number of non-
Roman character sets.

 Use public key certificates. Use this option to share files with users who have a public 
certificate. These certificates include ones you’ve added to your Trusted Identities list, or 
by searching online certificate directories you have access to. You can create a policy that 
applies different permissions to different users. Using this policy ensures that every docu-
ment is encrypted with the same settings for the recipients.
 Use Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management. If you have access to an Adobe LiveCycle 
Rights Management Server, you can create a security policy that is enforced by connect-
ing to the Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management Server. PDF documents and attachments 
can be secured for a selected group of users or for a period of time you determine when 
creating the policy. When a policy changes or expires on the server, the documents tied 
to the policy respect these changes as well.
To make the process of creating a security policy a little more clear, try the following steps to cre-
ate a policy using password security.
STEPS: Creating a password security policy
 
1. Open the Managing Security Policies Wizard. You open the Managing Security Policy 
Wizard by selecting Manage Security Policies from the Secure Task Button pull-down 
menu. You can access the wizard with or without a file open in the Document pane.
 
2. Create a new policy. In the Managing Security Policies Wizard, click the New button to 
open the New Security Policy Wizard pane, as shown in Figure 26.2. You have three 
options from which to choose. The default is Use passwords as shown in Figure 26.2. 
Leave the default settings as is and click Next. The Use the Adobe LiveCycle Rights 
Management Server is grayed out if you don’t have access to an Adobe LiveCycle Rights 
Management Server or you have not subscribed to the hosted Protect PDF service from 
Adobe Systems.
 
3. Add a name and description for the new policy. Type a policy name and description in 
the respective field boxes in the General Settings panel of the New Security Policy Wizard 
as shown in Figure 26.3. Select the box for Save passwords with the policy. The name 
and description you add in the second pane appears when you access the Managing 
Security Policies dialog box. Try to add information in the field boxes that describes the 
settings you use when creating the policy.
TIP
TIP
If you want to periodically change passwords, leave the check box unchecked. Each 
time you use the policy, Acrobat prompts you for a new password.

4. Add the security settings. Click Next. You arrive at the Document restrictions panel of 
the New Security Policy dialog box. This is the same dialog box you see in the Password 
Security – Settings dialog box shown earlier in Figure 26.1. Here you set the attributes for 
the security to be applied when using the policy. In my example, I selected Acrobat 7 
compatibility; checked the box for “Restrict editing and printing of the document. A pass-
word will be required in order to change these permission settings”; added a password; 
selected None from the Print allowed pull-down menu; and checked the last check box 
in the dialog box.
 
5. Review the policy. Click Next. The last pane (Summary) appears with a Finish button as 
shown in Figure 26.4. Click Finish to create the policy. You are returned to the Managing 
Security Policies dialog box where your new policy is listed in the policy list window, as 
shown in Figure 26.5. Notice that the name and description you added when creating the 
policy now appear in the Name and Description headings. Additionally you see a descrip-
tion of the policy details and encryption components for the policy you created. If creat-
ing multiple policies, select a policy name in the top window to change the policy details 
and encryption components in the lower half of the dialog box to reflect attributes for the 
selected policy. Click the Finish button to save the policy.
 
6. Secure a document. By default the Managing Security Policies dialog box opens as 
shown in Figure 26.5. Your new policy is listed in this dialog box. If you have a docu-
ment open in the Document pane, you can apply the policy to the open document.
 
 Select the policy you created and click the Apply to Document button. Acrobat opens a 
dialog box informing you that you need to save your file after applying the policy to com-
plete the security. Click OK and save the file. Your file is now secure using the permis-
sions you identified for the policy.

 FIGURE 26.5
Select the policy you want to use for securing a document and click the Apply to 
Document button.
If you work with documents where you need to add different permissions depending on the docu-
ment content and the users to whom you want to distribute your files, you’ll want to add addi-
tional policies each designed with different permissions. As you add additional policies, you can 
choose what policy you want to use to secure a document in one of two areas. Open a document 
and open the Secure task button. The pull-down menu shows your policy added as a Favorite by 
default and appearing in the task button pull-down menu. Select the menu command and click 
Yes when prompted in a dialog box. Save your file to apply the policy to the document.
The second area you find your policy listed is in the Managing Security Policies dialog box shown 
earlier in Figure 26.5. You open this dialog box by selecting Manage Security Policies from the 
Secure task button pull-down menu; the Managing Security Policies dialog box opens. Select the 
policy and click Apply to Document. Click Yes when prompted in a dialog box and save the file.
Managing security policies
You can add several policies using different permissions settings. Each time you create a new pol-
icy, it appears in the Managing Security Policies dialog box. Each time you want to secure docu-
ments with the same settings, open the Managing Security Policies dialog box and select a policy 
from the list. Click the Apply to Document button to secure the open document with the settings 
created from the selected policy.

  The Secure task button lists all your Favorites at the top of the pull-down menu. You add or 
delete Favorites in the Managing Security Policies dialog box. Select Manage Security Policies 
to open the Managing Security Policies dialog box. In the far left column you see a star icon 
adjacent to policy names. You also may not see a star icon adjacent to a policy name, as shown 
in Figure 26.6.
 FIGURE 26.6
Select a policy and click the Favorite button. The policy is then listed in the Secure task button pull-down 
menu.
To make a policy a Favorite, select a policy where you see no star icon and click the Favorite but-
ton. When you add a Favorite the policy is added to the Secure task button pull-down menu. If 
you want to remove a Favorite from the menu, open the Managing Security Policies dialog box and 
select the policy you want to remove. If it’s already a Favorite, the policy appears listed with a star 
icon adjacent to the policy name. Click the Favorite button to remove the policy from the Favorites 
list in the Secure task button pull-down menu.
Copying and editing policies
If you want to create a policy that’s based on an existing policy, you can copy the policy in the 
Managing Security Policies dialog box and modify the policy attributes. Assume for a moment you 
want to add password protection to open a file and use all the same attributes of an existing policy 
that doesn’t restrict the permissions to prompt for a password when a file is opened.
Select the policy you want to duplicate and click the Copy button. Acrobat opens the Creating a 
New Security Policy from an Existing Security Policy Wizard. This wizard offers the same options 
as shown earlier in the New Security Policy Wizard (see Figure 26.2 earlier in this chapter) for the 
General Settings, Document Restrictions, and Summary. In the General Settings pane, type a new 
name for the new policy and type a description. Click Next and set the permissions for the policy. 
Click Next to open the Summary pane. Review the permissions and click Finish. Your new policy 
is added to the Managing Security Policies dialog box.
Select a policy and click the Edit button to get the same wizard options as when copying files. You 
can modify a policy name and description and edit the permissions for an existing policy.

Viewing and deleting policies
Select a policy and click the View button. The Viewing a Security Policy Wizard opens where you 
can review settings for a given policy. In this wizard you can’t make any changes to the policy. If 
you need to change settings, use the Edit button.
Select a policy and click the Delete button. Acrobat prompts you in a warning dialog box to con-
firm the action. Click Yes to delete the policy. Click No and the policy remains without changes.
Understanding Digital IDs
A digital ID is a file that you create in Acrobat or acquire from a third-party signature provider. 
Your ID, also known as a credential or profile or certificate, is password protected and used to elec-
tronically sign or certify documents. Before you can digitally sign a document you need to create or 
acquire your own personal ID.
Digital IDs have two components important to understand — your personal or private digital ID 
and your public certificate. When you create a digital ID with Acrobat you are creating your private 
ID and your public certificate. The public certificate is a file you share with other users so they can 
encrypt files that they send to you. In order to open such encrypted files you need to supply the 
password used when you created your personal profile.
As a matter of understanding the security involved when using digital signatures, realize that, every 
time you want to sign a document you need to supply your password. Therefore, anyone having 
access to your computer cannot sign or certify a document on your behalf unless the user has your 
password. When a file is encrypted using your public certificate, the file is opened only when you 
have the digital ID and supply your password. Again, anyone having access to your computer can-
not open a document encrypted with your public certificate unless that user has access to your 
password. Private digital signature IDs are used to sign and decrypt documents. Public certificates 
are used to encrypt documents and validate signatures.
As mentioned earlier, each digital ID has two components — the private ID and the public certifi-
cate. The private ID can be used to either digitally sign a PDF or to decrypt documents encrypted 
with the public certificate, and conversely, the public certificate can be used to encrypt documents 
or to validate digital signatures.
Digital IDs can be created in Acrobat or acquired from other parties. They can then be accessed 
locally from your computer or from a remote server. For a quick look at the options available when 
working with digital IDs and public certificates, select Advanced ➪ Security Settings to open the 
Security Settings dialog box shown in Figure 26.7. This dialog box is used to manage and create 
digital IDs. You also use this dialog box to configure servers, time stamp digital IDs, and use the 
Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management Servers.

876

Part V
Choose Advanced ➪ Security Settings to open the Security Settings dialog box as shown in 
Figure 26.7. Here you choose from an option listed in the left pane of the wizard.
As shown in the dialog box, the options you have for working with digital IDs and configuring 
server access include the following:
 Digital IDs. There are three types of IDs available that include:
 A file. Available on Windows and Macintosh, this form of ID is similar to what you 
had available in earlier versions of Acrobat when using Acrobat Certificate Security. 
You can select Add ID (which opens the Add Digital ID dialog box to find an existing 
digital ID, create a new Acrobat Self-Sign, or get a third-party certificate).
 A roaming ID stored on a server. This option permits you to host your ID on a Web 
site server. You can access your ID anywhere in the world by logging on to the server 
that contains your roaming ID and digitally sign documents using any one of your IDs 
available on the server. Roaming ID accounts are available to both Windows and 
Macintosh users.
 A device connected to this computer. Use this option if you have a hardware device 
such as a token connected to your computer.
 A new digital ID I want to create now. You use this option when you want to create 
your own personal ID that will be stored on your computer.
 FIGURE 26.7
In the Security Settings dialog box you have four options for managing digital IDs and 
servers.

877
Authentication and Security
26
 Directory servers. This option is used to enable you to locate specific digital ID certifi-
cates from network servers for encrypting documents using Certificate Security. Directory 
servers can be added by importing a configuration supplied by a System Administrator, 
or by entering the parameters required to configure the server.
 Time Stamp Servers. This option is used if you need the additional security and authenti-
cation features of a time stamp as part of your signature. As with Directory Servers, Time 
Stamp Servers are added by importing a configuration from a system administrator or by 
adding parameters required to configure the server.
 Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management Servers. Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management 
Server (www.adobe.com/products/server/policy/main.html) is a server–
based security solution from Adobe Systems that provides dynamic control over PDF 
documents. Policies created with Acrobat or Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management Server 
are stored on the server and can be refreshed from the server. Once you’ve configured an 
Adobe Rights Management Server, all polices maintained on this server are available to 
you. You must log into Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management Server to use these policies. 
This option also requires that you access a URL provided by a System Administrator and 
add the server to your list of Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management Servers.
Creating a personal digital ID
Digital IDs can be created with or without custom appearance settings. The appearance of your sig-
nature has no effect on the kind of security you add to a signature. If you want to create a custom 
signature appearance such as a scanned analog signature, it’s usually best to first create the appear-
ance, and then create the digital ID.
Using Third-Party Signature Handlers
D
igital signature handlers, tokens, biometrics, hardware solutions, and other similar products are 
available from third-party providers and offer you many different options for securing PDF 
documents depending on the product and manufacturer. To find information on acquiring third-
party products for signature handling, take a look at Adobe’s Web site at http://partners.
adobe.com/security. On the Adobe Security Partner Web pages you find links to digital signa-
ture and document control vendors worldwide.
If you use Acrobat for languages other than US English, go to your local Web page and log on to 
Adobe’s Web site. You might use, for example, a URL such as www.adobe.com.fr/security for 
a French language document page. This page includes a link to security partners supporting the 
localized products.
When you create a digital ID in Acrobat by choosing Advanced ➪ Security Settings, the Security 
Settings dialog box opens. Select Directory Servers and click New. The Edit Directory Server dialog 
box opens where you identify a third-party server and provide log-on information and password.

Creating a custom appearance
Appearances for your digital IDs in Acrobat viewers earlier than version 9.0 required you to use the 
Security preferences dialog box. In Acrobat 9, you can create an appearance for a signature on-the-
fly when you sign a document and need to create a signature. If you don’t sign a document and 
start from scratch, you need to use the Security Preferences dialog box to add an appearance. What 
follows here assumes you are creating a new signature and not signing a form.
Open the Preferences dialog box (Ctrl/Ô+K) and click Security in the left pane. The right pane 
changes as shown in Figure 26.8.
 FIGURE 26.8
Click Security in the left pane in the Preferences dialog box to change the right pane changes where you

Two preferences dialog boxes are used for creating an appearance and setting some attributes for 
your signatures. These include:

 Security Preferences. You use the Security Preferences to create digital ID appearances 
for your personal digital IDs. If you want to add a logo, analog signature, symbol, or 
some text to an ID, you can do so by clicking the New button and choosing from various 
settings in the Configure Security Appearance dialog box.
 Advanced Preferences. If you have an ID configured such as the one shown in Figure 
26.8, the ID(s) appears in the Appearance list in the Security Preferences dialog box. 
Select an ID and click Advanced Preferences to open another dialog box where a number 
of options exist for verifying signatures, creating them, and, on Windows, options for set-
tings for Windows Integration. A number of different options exist in three tabs 
(Windows) or two tabs (Macintosh). For a detailed description of each item, consult the 
Acrobat Help document.
NOTE
NOTE
If you have not created a digital ID yet, you will not see anything listed in this box, 
but you still can create appearances that can later be used with a digital ID.
To understand how to create a custom appearance for a digital ID, follow these steps:
STEPS: Creating a custom digital ID appearance
 
1. Open the Security preferences. Press Ctrl/Ô+K. Click the Security item in the left pane.
 
2. Click the New button in the right pane to open the Configure Signature Appearance 
dialog box.
 
3. Configure the appearance. Type a title in the Title text box. This title will appear as the

to use a graphic, click the Imported graphic radio button and click File to open the Select 
Picture dialog box. Locate and select the graphic you want to use for the appearance. (Note 
that the file can be any file type supported by the Create PDF From File command.)
 
 Select the text items you want to display on your signature by checking boxes in the 
Configure Text area of the Configure Signature Appearance dialog box. In my example, 
I removed all check boxes, as shown in Figure 26.9.

Choose a key algorithm from the Key Algorithm pull-down menu. In earlier ver-
sions of Acrobat the highest encryption level you had was 128-bit encryption. New 
in Acrobat 9 you find an option for 256-bit encryption. If you choose 256-bit encryption, you can 
validate signatures in Acrobat viewers earlier than version 9.0.
 
5. Choose where you want to store the ID and type a password. Click Next in the wiz-
ard and click the Browse button to locate a folder where you want to save the ID (for 
New PKCS#12 digital ID files). Type a password in the Password text box and type the 
password again in the Confirm Password text box.
 
6. Click Finish. Click Finish in the Add Digital ID dialog box to return to the Security 
Settings dialog box. Your new digital ID is now ready to use.
Notice as yet, we have not selected an appearance for the digital ID. You can store multiple appear-
ances in the Security preferences and each time you sign a document, you can choose which 
appearance you want to use for your signature. You might, for example, sign documents internally 
in your company using one appearance, and with the same ID sign documents coming from other 
sources outside your company with another appearance.

You can create several digital IDs and assign different usage options for each ID. After adding IDs 
to the Security Settings dialog box, select an ID and open the Usage Options pull-down menu. 
From the commands shown in Figure 26.12, you have a number of different usage options. Click 
one of the options shown to assign that option to the selected ID. Click another ID and assign 
another option. You can assign only one option to an ID. If an option is used with one ID and you 
apply that option to another ID, the option is removed from the first ID and assigned to your new 
selection. After assigning options, you’ll notice the appearance of the options icons adjacent to the 
ID names.

Creating a signature field when signing a document
 
  If no signature field appears on a document, you can sign a document by accessing Sign 
Document from the Sign task button pull-down menu. This method of signing prompts you to 
marquee an area on a page where you want to create a signature field on the document. Click 
OK in the dialog box informing you what to do and draw a rectangle. When you release the 
mouse button, the Sign Document dialog box opens. Follow the same steps outlined in the next 
section.
Certifying a document
You have two choices for certifying a document with a digital ID. You can choose to certify a file 
with or without a visible signature. From the Sign pull-down menu, select Certify with Visible 
Signature to have your signature shown on the document. Choose Certify without Visible 
Signature to add an invisible signature to the file. Using either option opens the Save as Certified 
Document dialog box shown in Figure 26.14.
 FIGURE 26.14
Using either menu command in the Sign task button pull-down menu for certifying documents opens the

You have choices for acquiring a digital ID you have set up with an Adobe partner, or click OK to 
open the Sign Document dialog box where you apply a signature using the same criteria as when 
signing with and without signature fields.
A second option exists in the File menu. Select File ➪ Save As Certified Document. The same dia-

Working with PDF Portfolios
If you have multiple documents and you combine the files into a PDF Portfolio, all signatures on 
the documents that are added to the portfolio are retained. Furthermore, you can add signatures to 
PDFs after a PDF Portfolio has been assembled. In addition, you can secure individual documents 
before or after adding them to a PDF Portfolio. IN addition you can also sign and/or secure the 
portfolio.
Using signatures in PDF Portfolios
You might have a series of drawings that need to be signed by different engineers that is used for 
signing off on PDF documents within a Portfolio. The portfolio may be comprised of several draw-
ings or a series of forms in a portfolio with multiple signatures.
In Figure 26.15, a PDF Portfolio is shown with four PDF documents containing signatures. In this 
example all documents were signed before the files were assembled in a PDF Portfolio.

Part V
If a document in the portfolio is deleted or an edit is made to any one of the PDFs within the port-
folio, signatures remain valid for the PDFs that remain unedited. Each individual signed page in 
the file remains with a valid signature (see Figure 26.16) and the only signature that is invalidated 
is the signature-edited pages.
After you assemble a PDF Portfolio you can use the Advanced ➪ Sign & Certify ➪ Sign Document 
command to add digital signatures to a document within a portfolio. You don’t have access to the 
Form Edit mode while viewing a PDF Portfolio, but using this command enables you to add a sig-
nature field to any page on any file in a portfolio.

Adding security to PDF Portfolios
You can add security to individual files before assembling a PDF Portfolio. Acrobat permits you to 
add PDF documents to a PDF Portfolio without having to decrypt files. However, the viewer of the 
portfolio needs to decrypt files that have been password protected in order to see and/or edit the 
PDF content.
You can also secure an entire PDF Portfolio. Acrobat provides two ways to add security to PDF 
Portfolios. You can choose File ➪ Portfolio Properties and click the Security tab in the Document 
Properties dialog box. Security is added the same as I explained in the section “Using password 
security” earlier in this chapter.
Another method you can use to add password security to PDF Portfolios is the Modify ➪ 
Secure Portfolio menu command as shown in Figure 26.17. Select the command to open the 
Password Security – Settings dialog box as shown earlier in this chapter in Figure 26.1.
You can also add security policies to PDF Portfolios. Open the Advanced menu while viewing a portfo-
lio and choose Security. At the top of the Security submenu you’ll find a list of your Favorites for the 
security policies you added to the Favorites list. Choose a Favorite to apply the policy to the portfolio.
 FIGURE 26.17
PDF Portfolios can be secured using the Modify ➪ Secure Portfolio command.
Using Trusted Identities and 
Certificate Security
Trusted identities are added to the Trusted Identities Manager dialog box. The list of trusted identi-
ties is like an address book where you can add contacts and set certificate properties. You can 
maintain a contact list of trusted identities from people you do business with or may do business 
with. Each user listed in Trusted Identities can be used to validate digital signatures and encrypt 
PDF documents for these users. The Trusted Identities Manager additionally permits you to set lev-
els of trust from the users listed in your contact list.

888
PDF Publishing
Part V
Understanding Encryption, Validation, and 
the Trusted Identities Manager
I
n the Manage Trusted Identities dialog box (shown in Figure 26.19), a pull-down menu provides 
two choices: Contacts and Certificates. Items listed in the menus do not have to match. You can 
have certificates in the list that are not in the Contacts list. From the Display pull-down menu you 
can select either Contacts or Certificates and you can Add Contacts or Certificates respective to the 
menu item you select.
In order to encrypt documents you do not have to have a public certificate in your trusted identities. 
For example, a company may have a corporate-level security solution in which each employee is 
issued a certificate that is stored on a network server. You can search certificates on your company’s 
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server to find someone you want to encrypt for and 
just use their certificate without adding the certificate to your list of trusted identities.
To validate a signature, you do not have to have the public certificate in your trusted identities if 
you’ve already established a trust with a parent in the chain of trust. For example, you can create a 
Class 1 certificate for a security partner. So the chain might be Your Company, Inc. ➪ Partner Class 
1 ➪ Your Name.
You can then trust Your Company, Inc. (the root) and therefore everybody under that chain is auto-
matically trusted by you so you don’t need any individual’s certificate in your local trusted Identities 
for validation. However, if you want to give any user a different trust setting than the trust settings 
used by the parent, then you do need to add the individual’s certificate to your trusted identities.
Does an individual need to send you a public certificate? The answer is no, not if the user sends you 
a file signed with his/her certificate. You can always get the public certificate from a file sent to 
you.
To acquire a public certificate from a signed document, open a context menu on the signature and 
select Properties. In the Signature Properties dialog box, click the Show Certificate button. The 
Certificate Viewer dialog box opens. Click the Export button; you are prompted to save the certifi-
cate as a file or email the certificate.
The entire range of possibilities regarding using digital IDs, signing documents, and authenticating 
signed or certified documents is a very complex subject. In an effort to break it down to a more sim-
plified view, the detail in this chapter assumes you are working in an environment where you are 
not using a corporate-wide security solution and you’re using the self-sign methods of security. If 
you want the highest levels of security and the most efficient means for securing documents, I 
encourage you to carefully review the Acrobat Help document and explore all the security informa-
tion on Web pages hosted by Adobe Systems.

889

Using certificate encryption
Encryption using certificates is a means for you to add security for a selected group of users. The 
advantage of using certificates is you can control the permissions settings individually for each user 
in the same PDF document. In addition, since the user needs not only a password but the digital 
ID file, it becomes impossible for someone else to “crack.” For example, you may want to allow 
one user to view your document, but restrict printing. For another user you may want to disallow 
editing, but enable printing. For a third user you may want to allow editing and printing. All these 
permissions can be set for each user in the same PDF document using the Certificate Security 
Settings dialog box.
To encrypt a file using certificates, you need access to the public certificate. You can either search 
for the public certificates, which may be located on a network server, or you can collect the public 
certificates for each user and load them into your Trusted Identities list. Keep in mind, the Trusted 
Identities Manager is like an address book and merely is a convenient location where you can store 
contact and certificate information for users you frequently work with. During encryption you can 
specify permissions settings individually for each user.
Exporting public certificates
Public certificates are used for validating signatures on documents received and encrypting files 
which you plan to share. For another user to validate your signature or encrypt a file unique to 
your profile, you need to export your public certificate and share it with other users. Your public 
certificate does not compromise your password settings or ability to secure your own files. Public 
certificates are generated from your profile, but do not send along your password to other users.
NOTE
NOTE
Companies using directory servers to host public certificates do not need to export 
certificates. For self-sign security you also don’t need to acquire a certificate from 
another user. A user can sign a document and you can open the signature Properties dialog box 
and click the Export button to gain access to the certificate. The only thing you need to be con-
cerned about is that the first signed file you receive from a given recipient has an authentic sig-
nature from the user you know has signed the document. If you trust the file, export the 
certificate. You can use that certificate for all subsequent documents from the user in question.
To export a public certificate you need to start with a digital ID you have already created. Choose 
Advanced ➪ Security Settings. The Security Settings dialog box shown earlier in Figure 26.7 opens. 
If you have more than one ID listed in the dialog box, select the ID you want to use and click 
the Export button. The Data Exchange File – Export Options dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 26.18.

 FIGURE 26.18
When exporting your certificate, you can choose to save the public certificate as a file or email the certifi-
cate to another user.
In this dialog box you make a choice for saving your public certificate to disk or emailing the cer-
tificate directly to another user. If you select Save the data to a file, you can later attach it to an 
email message and send it to users as needed. If you select the Email the data to someone radio 
button and click the Next button, the Compose Email dialog box opens where you add the recipi-
ent’s email address. Enter an email address and click the Email button to attach the data file to a 
new email message. Acrobat supplies a default message in the email note for you providing instruc-
tions for the recipient, but you can edit if desired.
Requesting contacts
If you want to add a contact and/or certificate to your list of trusted identities, select Advanced ➪
 Manage Trusted Identities to open the Trusted Identities dialog box. Click the Request Contact 
button to open the Email a Request dialog box. You add your name, email address, and any con-
tact information you want to supply in the text boxes in the Email a Request dialog box. Click the 
Next button to open the Compose Email dialog box. In this dialog box, you add the recipient email 
address. A default subject and message appear in the Compose Email dialog box informing the 
recipient you are requesting a copy of the individual’s certificate. Click the Email button to email 
the request to the recipient. Note that you may need to open your default email program and click 
the Send or Send/Receive button to initiate a send.
When a copy of a certificate is emailed back to you, the file appears in a message window as a file 
attachment. Double-click the attachment to add the certificate is automatically to your list of 
trusted identities after you approve adding the ID or click OK.
Managing trusted identities
After you collect public certificates, you can load the certificates into your Trusted Identities list for 
easy management and quick access of the certificates. To load certificates, choose Advanced ➪ 
Manage Trusted Identities. The dialog box shown in Figure 26.19 opens.

 FIGURE 26.19
You use the Manage Trusted Identities dialog box to add identities from public certificates you collect from 
other users.
To add a recipient, click the Add Contacts button. The Choose Contacts to Import dialog box 
shown in Figure 26.20 opens where you can browse your hard drive or network server to locate 
certificates from other users. When adding identities collected by other users, click the Browse but-
ton. The Locate Certificate File dialog box opens where you navigate your hard drive and locate 
certificates to add to a recipient list. Click Open; the recipient’s name appears in the top window of 
the Choose Contacts to Import dialog box. Select the name of the added contact and click the 
Import button to add the certificate to the identities list. You use the Search button to search 
through network servers configured in your Directory Servers.
Emailing Certificates vs. Exporting from Signatures
S
ince a user who receives a signed document from you can open the signature Properties and 
acquire your signature by showing the certificate and clicking an Export button, you may feel 
that exporting a certificate and emailing your public certificate to a user is an unnecessary step. In 
some cases it is unnecessary.
Where you have an advantage for exporting a certificate and emailing to others is simply adding 
another level of security to your workflow. If a signed document is sent to a user, the user may not 
be certain that the document came from you. If you sign a document, send it to a user, then email 
your exported certificate to the same user in a separate email, the recipient receives two mails. This 
workflow simply adds one more level of assurance that the certificate came from you.

Setting certificate security permissions
One thing to keep in mind is that when you have circumstances that require you to repeat docu-
ment security for the same set of users or when encrypting documents with the same set of permis-
sions, you’ll always want to set up a security policy. In those instances where you intend to secure 
a document using certificates one time only, you can set permissions without creating a policy. To 
help simplify the process, this section refers to setting up permissions using certificates for a one-
time use.
To secure a document using Certificate Security, open the Document Properties dialog box 
(File ➪ Properties). Click the Security tab and select Certificate Security from the Security Method 
pull-down menu. The Certificate Security Settings Wizard opens. The General settings panel offers 
you the choice to save your settings as a policy or discard the settings after applying the security. 
In addition you have options for what you want to encrypt, such as the document only or the

document and file attachments and the type of encryption you want to apply. In Figure 26.21, you 
can see the options in the General settings pane. Make a choice for saving your settings as a policy 
or discarding the settings after applying them. If you choose to create a policy, add a name and 
description. At the bottom of the General pane, make a choice for the type of encryption you want 
to apply and click Next.

The great strength for using Certificate Security is that all the recipients in your list can be assigned 
unique permissions. For example, you can prohibit printing for one user, and allow low-resolution 
printing for another user and high-resolution printing for a third user. In addition, you can protect 
against a number of different editing options. All of these permissions settings are applied to indi-
vidual recipients in the same PDF document or PDF Portfolio. Each user needs to open the file 
using his or her own digital ID and password.
To complete the Certificate Security, click the Next button to open the Summary panel. A sum-
mary for your policy is listed in the panel. If you want to make any changes, click the Back button. 
To accept the settings you made, click Finish. Save the file and all the permissions assignments to 
your recipients are encrypted in the document.
Validating Signatures
Digital signatures would be of no value unless you could confirm that a document was signed by 
the individual claiming to have signed the document. For confirmation purposes you use menu 
commands and options to validate signatures. You have several options when validating signatures, 
and all depend on different circumstances, which include:
 If you have established trust with a parent, you don’t need the certificate listed in your 
trusted identities. See the “Understanding Encryption, Validation, and the Trusted 
Identities Manager” sidebar earlier in this chapter. When you open a signed PDF from 
another person using a third-party security partner certificate, the signature appears as 
Unknown. Select Properties from a context menu you open on the signature. In the 
Signature Properties dialog box, click Verify Signature. The signature appears valid with-
out adding to your trusted identities. If you want to change the level of trust, you can add 
the certificate to your trusted identities and set the trust in the Manage Trusted Identities 
dialog box. See the “Managing trusted identities” section earlier in this chapter.
 If you open a self-signed document and the user hasn’t used a third-party security part-
ner, and you know the document has been sent to you by the PDF author, you can 
retrieve the certificate from the document without needing the individual to send you the 
certificate. You might receive files from members of your workgroup where you are confi-
dent the document you receive comes from the individual who signed it. In this case, you 
can open the Signature panel, select the Signature, and select Validate Signature. Another 
Signature Validation dialog box opens. Click Signature Properties in this dialog box to 
open the Signature Properties dialog box. Open the Trust tab in the Signature Properties 
and click the Add to Trusted Identities button. The certificate is added to your trusted 
identities where you can set the level of trust and use the certificate to validate signatures.

896
PDF Publishing
Part V
 If you open a document from an anonymous user or one where you question the docu-
ment authenticity, you can request a certificate. You add the certificate you receive from a 
PDF author to your trusted identities, and you can choose to set the level of trust follow-
ing the same steps outlined in the section “Managing trusted identities” earlier in this 
chapter.
To validate a signature, open the Security panel and choose Validate Signature. Choose Validate All 
Signatures from the same menu if you want to validate all signatures in a document where multiple 
signatures exist.
When you open a signed document and view signatures in the Signatures panel, an icon with a 
question mark may appear adjacent to the signature(s). In addition, you’ll notice the text below the 
signature icon often states that the signature validity is unknown; or for valid signatures, the text 
reads: Signature is valid. You’ll also find the validity of a signature reported in the Signature 
Message Bar as shown in Figure 26.24.
NOTE
NOTE
Contained in the Security Preferences (Ctrl/Ô+K and click Security in the left pane) 
is a check box for Verify signatures when the document is opened. If the check box 
is enabled, the signatures in the document are validated when the document opens. In this case, 
you do not need to manually access a menu command to validate a signature. Acrobat 9 auto-
matically validates signatures when a document is opened. You do, however, still need to have a 
trusted certificate from the individual who signed the document in order to validate upon open-
ing the file. If using an external certificate authority, you need to have an active Internet connec-
tion to your service to verify signatures. If this box is unchecked, you must manually validate 
your signatures. Be aware that if your document has more than 10 pages, Acrobat may not vali-
date signatures automatically upon opening the document. This behavior prevents a document 
from slowing down during open time. If you find documents not certifying signatures at open 
time, manually review the signatures in the Signatures panel and use the Validate Signature com-
mand in the Options pull-down menu.
When you validate a signature, Acrobat opens a dialog box reporting the validation status. If the 
public certificate is loaded and the validation is true, a dialog box opens reporting the certificate is 
valid.
If you get UNKNOWN, this certificate is not in your trusted identities. Select the Signature 
Properties menu command in the Signature panel Options menu or a context menu opened on a 
signature in the Signatures panel. From the Summary tab select Show Certificate. From the Trust 
tab, select your Trust Settings and select Add to Trusted Identities. The Import Contact Settings 
appear when you determine which Trust Settings you want. Select OK in the Certificate Viewer 
window. You are returned to Signature Properties. Select Validate Signature. This signature will 
now be Valid. Select Close to return to the Document pane.
You can view the signature properties in the Signature Properties dialog box, which reports all the 
properties of the certificate including the reason for signing, the email address of the person sign-
ing the document, and the certificate fingerprint. The Signatures panel reflects a valid signature, as 
shown in Figure 26.24.

 FIGURE 26.24
After a signature is validated, the icon adjacent to the signature name changes to a pen and check mark,

Creating a Security Envelope
Another security option you have in Acrobat is creating a secure envelope adding any file you want 
to use as a file attachment. You can create eEnvelopes containing file attachments and secure the 
PDF and file attachment(s) against unauthorized access. Users of Acrobat or the free Adobe Reader 
software with access rights can open the PDFs and extract the file attachment(s).
To understand how files are attached in a Secure PDF Delivery workflow, follow these steps.

Summary
 PDF documents can be secured with built-in Acrobat Self-Signed Security and security 
handlers acquired from third-party developers. Files can be secured from users opening 
documents, editing documents, or both.
 Different levels of security can prevent users of Acrobat viewers earlier than version 6 
from opening files. It is important to know your user audience and what version of 
Acrobat viewers they use before securing files.
 To digitally sign a document you need to create a digital ID. You create and manage digi-
tal IDs via several menu commands and menu options found in the Secure Task Button 
pull-down menu.
 You can apply appearance settings to your signatures in the form of scanned documents, 
icons, and symbols from files saved as PDF or other file formats compatible with the 
Create PDF From File command. You add signature appearances via the Security 
Preferences dialog box.

 You can digitally sign a document by using an existing signature field or by selecting a 
menu command where you are prompted to create a signature field.
 You can certify a document using your signature by selecting a menu command to certify 
the document.
 Security and certificate security can be applied to PDF Portfolios.
 Trusted identities are a list of digital ID certificates from people you share information 
with. You can export your public certificate to a file or attach your public certificate to an 
email message from within Acrobat. When other users have your public certificate, they 
can validate your signature or encrypt documents for your use.
 You can encrypt files for a group of users by using their public certificates stored as 
trusted identities. A single PDF document can be secured for different users and with 
different permissions for each user.
 In order to validate a signature, the public certificate for that digital ID needs to be loaded 
into your Trusted Identities list.
 Any file of any type can be added to a secure envelope. The only way for an end user to 
access the file attachment is to have the password to open the attached file.

hroughout this book, I address using PDFs on the Web. As I dis-
cussed in Chapter 7, you can download selected Web pages or entire 
Web sites and have all the HTML pages converted to PDF. In Acrobat 6 
and greater you can convert media, animation, and sound to PDFs with the 
animated pages appearing the same in Acrobat viewers as when you see them 
on Web sites. In Chapter 8 I talked about using the PDFMaker with Microsoft 
Internet Explorer and Microsoft Outlook.
In Chapter 20, I discussed comments and, in Chapter 21, I covered online 
reviews. Coming ahead in Chapter 30, I talk about eBooks and downloading 
books as Digital Editions. In Chapter 34, I talk about submitting form data. 
And in other chapters, you find similar discussions on Acrobat PDFs hosted 
online. In short, the Web plays a major role with much of your Acrobat 
activity. In this chapter, I cover more about using PDFs online for viewing 
in Web browsers and linking to PDF views on Web sites.
Setting Up the Environment
To accomplish the tasks in this chapter, you use other authoring applications 
and set preferences for Acrobat viewers to accommodate viewing PDFs in 
Web browsers. When creating links and form fields in PDFs designed for Web 
viewing, you need to open several toolbars.
Open the More Tools window by opening a context menu on the Acrobat 
Toolbar window and select More Tools or select Tools ➪ Customize Toolbars. 
In the More Tools window, check the toolbar check boxes for Advanced 
Editing Toolbar. When creating form buttons and links, the Properties Bar 
can be helpful. To open the Properties Bar, open a context menu on the 
Toolbar Well and select Properties Bar or press Ctrl/Ô+E.

When viewing PDFs in Web browsers, you may need additional tools depending on what you do

PDFs in a browser window, you can open toolbars through the same context menu opened from 
the Toolbar Well in the browser window. Rather than setting up the work environment ahead of 
time with these additional tools, leave the tools used for viewing PDFs online hidden until you 
need them during a Web-viewing session.
Viewing PDFs in Web Browsers
You open a PDF in a Web browser just as you open a file to view an HTML document. You 
specify a URL and filename to view the PDF directly in the browser or click on a Web link from 
within a PDF document to open a URL where a PDF is hosted. For example, logging on to www.
provider.com/file.pdf results in the display of the PDF page inside the browser window. 
This type of viewing is referred to as inline viewing, an example of which appears in Figure 27.1.
 FIGURE 27.1
Inline viewing of PDFs offers you access to many Acrobat tools, which are available from the Toolbar 
Well, just as when viewing PDFs in Acrobat.

You can also open PDFs on your local hard drive by selecting File ➪ Open (Windows) or File ➪ Open 
File (Macintosh). In the Open dialog box, click Browse (Windows), navigate your hard drive, and 
select the file you want to open. On the Mac just navigate your hard drive in the Open dialog box 
and select the file you want to open. Click Open and the file opens in the Web browser window. 
On the Mac, Safari is supported the same as you have available with Microsoft Internet Explorer, 
as shown in Figure 27.2.
In Figures 27.1 and 27.2, toolbars are open and docked in the Toolbar Well. You have access to 
tools, commands, and preference settings while viewing PDFs online or locally from your hard drive 
directly in a browser window. You open toolbars in Web browsers the same way you open them in 
Acrobat: open a context menu opened from the Toolbar Well and select More Tools. In the More 
Tools window, check the boxes for the toolbars you want to appear in the browser window.
By default, all Web-hosted PDFs are opened inside your browser. From the browser application 
you can save a PDF document to your hard drive by choosing File ➪ Save As.
 FIGURE 27.2
PDF files can be opened locally on your hard drive in a browser application. On the Mac, you find Safari 
supporting inline PDF views just as Windows does.

If you prefer to open Web-hosted PDFs in Acrobat, you need to adjust preferences in Acrobat. 
Preference options provide you choices for viewing PDFs inside your Web browser as an inline 
view or viewing Web-hosted PDFs inside Acrobat the same as you would view locally hosted PDF 
documents. To change preferences, choose Edit ➪ Preferences. In the Preferences dialog box, select 
Internet in the left pane. The viewing preferences appear in the right pane, as shown in Figure 27.3.
 FIGURE 27.3
To change Web viewing preferences, open the Preferences dialog box and select Internet in the left pane.
Options for handling PDFs on Web sites with Acrobat viewers include the following:
 Display PDF in browser. The check box is enabled by default, and PDFs viewed on Web 
sites are displayed as inline views in browser applications. If you disable the check box as 
shown in Figure 27.3, PDFs are displayed in Acrobat viewers. The default Acrobat viewer 
installed on your computer opens if no viewer is currently open and the target document 
is shown in the Acrobat viewer Document pane.
 Allow fast web view. This option speeds up viewing PDFs on Web servers. When this 
option is enabled, a single page is downloaded to your computer and shown according to 
how you set your preferences — in the browser window or in an Acrobat viewer window. 
As you scroll pages in a PDF document, each new page downloads when the page is 
loaded in the Document pane. If you deselect the check box, the entire PDF document is 
downloaded to your computer before the first page appears in the browser window or the 
Acrobat Document pane. You must save the PDF with Fast Web View and the server 
must be capable of byte-serving for fast Web view to work.
 Allow speculative downloading in the background. If you select the preceding Allow 
fast web view option, and want to continue downloading multiple page PDF documents, 

907
Working with PDFs and the Web
27
check this box. As you view a page, the remaining pages continue to download until the 
complete PDF is downloaded from a Web site.
 Connection Speed. Select the speed of your Internet connection from the pull-down 
menu choices. This setting applies to viewing Web pages, but also influences the speed 
selection for viewing multimedia.
 Internet Settings. If you click the Internet Settings button, the Internet Properties dialog 
box opens. In the Internet Properties dialog box you can make choices for configuring 
your Internet connection, choosing default applications for email, making security set-
tings choices, setting privacy attributes, and other such system-level configurations.
Working with Web links
Web links to PDFs hosted on Web sites occur from within HTML documents and from within PDF 
files. If using an HTML editor like Adobe Dreamweaver, or writing HTML code, you create Web 
links the same as you link to Web pages. A PDF Web link in HTML might look like http://
www.mycompany.com/brochure.pdf — where the link is made to the PDF instead of a 
document that ends with an .htm or .html extension.
Web addresses contained in the text of a PDF document can be hot links to URLs where PDFs are 
hosted. In earlier versions of Acrobat you needed the complete URL address including http:// for a 
Web link to be recognized. In Acrobat 8 and 9, a URL like www.adobe.com is recognized as a 
Web link. Text in PDF documents with URL addresses can be converted to Web links via a menu 
command. If you distribute PDF files to users of Acrobat 6 or below, you need to add links to the 
PDF document for the users of these viewers to access Web pages from a PDF.
To create Web links from text in PDF documents, choose Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ 
Create Links from URLs. Acrobat opens the Create Web Links dialog box shown in Figure 27.4. 
In the dialog box you make decisions for the pages where the links are created. Select All to create 
Web links from all pages in the PDF. The From button enables you to supply page ranges in the 
two field boxes.
 FIGURE 27.4
The Create Web Links dialog box enables you to target pages for creating Web links.

908

Part V 
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Be aware that you don’t need to create links in PDF files distributed to Adobe 
Reader or Acrobat version 7 and above. However, the end user needs to have a 
preference option enabled in order for an Acrobat viewer to recognize text as a URL. Open the 
General preferences and look at the check box where you see Create links from URLs. By default 
the check box is checked. If this check box is not enabled, links aren’t recognized from text.
Acrobat can also globally remove Web links from all pages or a specified page range. To remove 
Web links, choose Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Remove All Links. The same options are 
available in the Remove Web Links dialog box as those found in the Create Web Links dialog box.
TIP
TIP
You can create Web links only from text that has been properly identified in the text 
of the PDF file (either www.Company.com or http://www.company.com). If you 
need to add a Web link, you can easily create the text in Acrobat without having to return to the 
authoring program. Select the TouchUp Text tool from the Advanced Editing toolbar. Hold down 
the Ctrl key (Option key on Macintosh) and click. The text cursor blinks where you click and is 
ready for you to add new type on the page. Type the URL for the Web link, deselect the text by 
selecting the Hand tool, and then click in the Document pane. Choose Advanced ➪ Document 
Processing ➪ Create Links from URLs. Acrobat creates the Web link from the URL you added to 
the document.
Web links in the Organizer
The Organizer behaves like a Web browser bookmark repository when you’re creating links to 
URLs. You first view a PDF document as an inline view in your Web browser and access the 
Organizer tool in the Acrobat Toolbar Well within the browser window. The URL for the current 
viewed document in the Web browser is captured when you add the URL to a collection. After 
quitting your Web browser, you can access the URL from within Acrobat and the Organizer collec-
tions. Opening a document within a collection launches your Web browser and takes you to the 
URL where the PDF is located. The PDF is then opened inside the browser window, if your view-
ing preferences remain at the defaults.

For more information on using the Organizer, see Chapter 5.
Adding Web links to multiple pages
You may have documents that need Web links created across multiple pages. An example might 
be a document that has been repurposed from an original design that was created for output to 
prepress, and then later downsampled and hosted on a Web site. In the original design, you might 
have a Web link on the cover page, but for the Web-hosted document you may want to create a 
Web link to an order form or your home page on each page in the brochure document. Where the 
same URL is specified on each page and the location of the Web link is the same on every page, 
you can create the Web links in Acrobat after the PDF has been sampled for Web display. The fol-
lowing steps outline a procedure for creating Web links on multiple pages for similar designs or 
legacy files that don’t have Web addresses added in the original authoring application document 
before a PDF has been created:

Chapter 18.
STEPS: Creating Web links on multiple PDF pages
 
1. Add a header/footer to a multi-page PDF document. Open the file where the Web links 
are to be added and choose Document ➪ Header & Footer ➪ Add. In the Add Header 
and Footer dialog box, create a header or footer and set the type size, the alignment, the 
color, and the offset distance desired. In this example, I added a footer (center aligned), 
used Arial 8-point text, and left offsets at the defaults, as shown in Figure 27.5. (In this 
example, I used an incomplete URL but I started my URL address with www.)
 
2. Click OK.
 
3. Save the file.
 
4. Open the Web link. Move the Hand tool to a Web link and a tooltip reports the full URL 
address as shown in Figure 27.6. Click the link and the file opens in your Web browser.
 FIGURE 27.5
Click on one of the Header or Footer alignment boxes (Left, Center, Right) and add the 
URL text. Select a font, font size, and offset distance, and then click the OK button.

For more information on creating headers and footers, see Chapter 16.
TIP
TIP
If you want Web links to appear rotated along the left or right side of your PDF docu-
ment, choose Document ➪ Rotate Pages. Add a header or footer as described in the 
preceding steps. Choose Document ➪ Rotate Pages and select the rotation option that turns the 
pages back to the original view. Save the document, and the Web links are positioned vertically 
on each page.
Controlling links view behavior
By default, when you click on a URL link to a PDF document, whether from within your Web 
browser or from within Acrobat, the resulting view takes you to the same view established in your 
Initial View properties. Therefore, if your Initial View properties are set to Page Only, Single Page, 
Fit Page, and Page number 1, the PDF document opens in the Web browser according to these set-
tings just as you would view the file in Acrobat.
The links you create to open different documents and different pages in a PDF file are often unus-
able when you’re viewing PDFs in Web browsers. A link, for example, that opens a secondary PDF 
won’t work in a Web browser unless you modify the link properties and link to the URL where the 
destination document resides. The Web browser needs URL links to open secondary files. Inasmuch 
as you may have all links working well for CD-ROM distribution, the links need to have some 
adjustments made before you can host the PDF documents with usable links on Web servers.
As an example, suppose you want to open page 2 in a PDF file on a Web server. You create a link 
in one document, direct the link to the URL where the PDF is hosted, and instruct the Web browser 
or Acrobat viewer to open page 2. To create the link, use either the Link tool or a form field button 
and enter the following code in an Open Web Link action:
http://www.west.net/~ted/pdf/manual.pdf#page=2
In this example, the #page=2 text following the PDF filename is the trigger to open page 2. In 
addition to accessing user-specified pages, you can control viewing behavior for page layouts, page 
views, zooms, linking to destinations, and a host of other attributes you assign to the Open Web 
Link action. Some examples of the code to use following the PDF document name in URL links 
include the following:

911

 Fit Page view: #view=Fit
 Destinations: #nameddest=Section1
 Open Bookmarks palette: #pagemode=bookmarks
 Open Pages palette: #pagemode=thumbs
 Collapsing palettes: #pagemode=none
 Combining viewing options: #page=3&pagemode=bookmarks&zoom=125
TIP
TIP
More information related to file links on Web hosted documents can be found on 
Adobe’s Web site. Log on to www.adobe.com/education/pdf and type Web 
linking in the Search box. A number of different articles discussing Web links in PDFs are 
reported in the search results. In addition, you can find several articles covering Web links in 
PDFs on the Acrobat User Community Web site. Log on to www.acrobatusers.com and visit 
the blogs and articles sections.
The preceding are some examples for controlling view options when opening PDFs in Web browsers. 
For each item be aware that you need to use the complete URL address and add one of these options 
following the location where the PDF document is hosted. Using the page mode example, the com-
plete open action URL might look like http://www.mycompany.com/file.
pdf#pagemode=bookmarks.
Opening Web links in new browser windows
If you have a PDF file viewed as an inline view in a browser window, you might want a link to a 
second PDF document that opens in a new browser window. Using the Open a web link action in 
the Button field properties always opens a Web link in the same browser window. To trigger a link 
action for opening a second browser window requires a JavaScript.
To set up a link to open a PDF in a second browser window, follow these steps.
Steps: Opening Web links in new browser windows
 
1. Create a button link. Open the Advanced Editing toolbar, click the Button tool, and cre-
ate a button on a PDF page.
 
2. Click Show All Properties in the abbreviated properties window to open the Button 
Properties dialog box. Note that you can change the name of the button immediately 
after clicking the Button tool by typing a name in the Field Name text box.
 
3. Click the Actions tab. If you want to change appearance settings, first click Appearance 
and set the properties for the Button border and fill colors.
 
4. Choose Run a JavaScript from the Select Action pull-down menu.
 
5. Click the Add button to open the JavaScript Editor.
 
6. Type the following code in the JavaScript Editor:
app.launchURL(“http://www.company.com/myFile.pdf”, true);
 
7. Click OK in the JavaScript Editor and click Close in the Button Properties dialog box.

Adding URL links to text fields
Suppose you have a form and you want a user to supply a Web address in a field. After the form is 
completed by a form filler, a reviewer may want to visit the URL to view the Web page. You can 
copy the text from the field and paste the URL in the Location bar in your Web browser. However, 
you can simplify the process by adding a Web link to the field so the reviewer of a form just clicks 
the text field to launch the default Web browser and open the associated URL.
Follow these steps to add a URL Web link to a text field.
Steps: Opening Web links from text fields
 
1. Create a text field on a form or open a form with a text field.
 
2. Click the Select Object tool and double-click the text field to open the Text Field 
Properties dialog box.
 
3. Click the Actions tab.
 
4. Choose Run a JavaScript from the Select Action pull-down menu.
 
5. Click the Add button to open the JavaScript Editor.
 
6. Type the following code in the JavaScript Editor:
if ( !/^\s*$/.test(event.target.value) ) app.launchURL(event.
target.value);
 
7. Click OK in the JavaScript Editor and click Close in the Text Field Properties 
dialog box.
When the form filler clicks in the field the form field is ready to accept text. After adding text, 
tabbing out of the field, and clicking again in the field, the JavaScript is executed and the user’s 
default Web browser opens the URL specified in the text field.

Converting PDF to HTML
In Chapter 9, I talked about exporting PDFs to a number of different file formats using the Save As 
command and the File ➪ Export menu command. In that chapter, you find a summary of the attri-
butes for exporting documents from PDF including exports to HTML. In this chapter, I move for-
ward a little and cover exporting to HTML in a little more depth.

913
Working with PDFs and the Web
27
At the onset, let me say that Adobe hasn’t done much with the exports to HTML features in 
Acrobat. With the exception of adding an Export task button in Acrobat 8 and the File ➪ Export 
menu in Acrobat 9, the options you have for exporting to HTML are identical to the options you 
had in Acrobat 6 and 7 Standard and Professional.
Using the export to HTML features in Acrobat can get your PDF content into HTML format, but 
page geometry and formatting is generally lost when you try to get PDF content to HTML. The best 
you can hope for is exporting text and images that permit you to use the assets in a program like 
Adobe Dreamweaver where you re-create the Web page using the tools and formatting capabilities 
of an HTML editor.
Setting export options
You can control option settings in the Preferences dialog box (Ctrl/Ô+K) by clicking on the Convert 
from PDF item in the left pane. The right pane displays a list of export formats including HTML 3.2 
and HTML 4.01 with CSS 1.0 (Cascading Style Sheets). Click the Edit Settings button and you see 
a list of options you can edit. These same options are also available to you in the Save As dialog 
box when you use the Export command.
Open a PDF document and choose File ➪ Export ➪ HTML (either 3.2 or 4.01 format). After select-
ing the Format, click the Settings button and you see the settings options as shown in Figure 27.7. 
Again, these options are the same as you have available in the Preferences dialog box. In addition, 
the Settings options are the same for both HTML formats.
 FIGURE 27.7
The Settings adjustments in either the Preferences dialog box or the Save As dialog box are identical.

914

Part V 
The settings options include:
 Encoding. A number of encoding options appear from the pull-down menu. If you have 
special characters in text, use either UTF-8 or UTF-16. If you use an encoding method 
such as UCS-4, the special characters won’t be recognized.
 Generate bookmarks. Links to sections in the HTML document are made from the PDF 
bookmarks.
 Generate tags for untagged documents. If a document is not tagged, check this box to 
add tagging for accessibility.
 Generate images. If your PDF document has images and you want them converted to a 
format recognized by HTML, be certain to check this box.
 Use sub-folder. All images can be saved to a subfolder nested below the HTML file. 
Check this box to copy the images to a separate folder. The default folder name is images. 
You can edit the name and provide a name of your choosing for the folder where the 
images are saved.
 Use prefix. If you want a prefix added to your images, check the box and type a prefix 
name in the text box.
 Output format. Choose from the options for the image format you want for the exported 
images. Use JPG if you have photo images.
 Downsample to. Check this box and select an amount to downsample images. The 
default is 150 ppi. Change this item to 72 ppi for Web viewing.
Converting text documents to HTML
One thing to keep in mind when you convert PDF files to HTML is that the entire PDF document 
is converted to a single HTML file. If you want separate HTML documents your best option is to 
first Select Document ➪ Extract Pages. Enter the page numbers you want to extract for one HTML 
file and click OK. Convert the pages to HTML using the Export ➪ HTML command. Then return 
to the original document and extract the pages you want for your second HTML file and convert to 
HTML, and so on.
CROSS-REF

For more information on extracting pages in PDFs, see Chapter 16.
If you have a PDF with bookmarks, you can convert to HTML with the bookmarks appearing in the 
HTML document and linked to the sections of the document that are bookmarked in the original 
PDF file. To see how to convert a text file with bookmarks, follow these steps:
STEPS: Converting PDF text-only documents to HTML
 
1. Open a file containing bookmarks in Acrobat. In this example I open a file converted 
from Microsoft Word containing bookmarks.

915
Working with PDFs and the Web
27
 
2. Open the Export to HTML dialog box. Select File ➪ Export ➪ HTML and choose either 
HTML export option. The export dialog box is the Save As dialog box you get when you 
also select File ➪ Save As.
 
3. Adjust Settings. Click the Settings button in the Save As dialog box and make setting 
adjustments as described in the “Setting export options” section earlier in this chapter. In 
this example, I check the box for Generate bookmarks. Because there are no images in my 
file, I don’t need to address any of the options for exporting images.
 
4. Click OK. Depending on the size of your file, you may see a progress bar report the 
export progress or you may just see a flash on your screen. The file is exported without 
any confirmation dialog box.
 
5. View the exported HTML in a Web browser. Open your Web browser and select 
File Open. Navigate your hard drive and select the exported file and open it. If you had 
Bookmarks in the file, they appear as links as shown in Figure 27.8.
 FIGURE 27.8
The exported HTML file is opened in a Web browser with links appearing for the 
Bookmark items that were contained in the PDF file.

Exporting PDF files with images to HTML
The process for exporting images is much the same as exporting text files. However, the one option 
you’ll want to edit in the Settings dialog box is the image attributes. To see how PDFs with images 
are converted to HTML, follow these steps:
STEPS: Converting multi-page PDFs with images to HTML
 
1. Open a PDF file with multiple pages and images.
 
2. Select File ➪ Export ➪ HTML and choose an HTML format.
 
3. Adjust Settings options. Click Settings and select the Output format. In this example, I 
check the JPG radio button. Click Downsample to and select 72 from the dpi pull-down 
menu.
 
4. Click OK. The file may take a little time to export depending on the size of your PDF 
document. When the progress bar finishes, the file is ready to open in your Web browser 
or HTML editor.
 
5. Open the file in your Web browser. In Figure 27.9, you can see a partial view of my 
exported file. The original document had two letter and two tabloid pages with several 
images on each page. This document needs a lot of editing in an HTML editor to format 
text and graphics for a Web page design.
 FIGURE 27.9
The HTML file needs a lot of work to polish up the design.
Figure 27.10 shows the portion of the original PDF document that was exported to HTML.

 FIGURE 27.10
The original PDF document that was used to export to the HTML file shown in Figure 27.9
The best you can hope for with the PDF exports to HTML is a good starting place for editing the 
HTML in an HTML editor. Acrobat provides you some basic tools to get a PDF document to HTML 
format. From there, you can expect to do some editing in your favorite HTML editor.
One alternative you have available is to explore using a third-party plug-in designed for exporting 
PDFs to HTML. A number of different plug-in products are distributed by a number of developers. 
To find some of the latest plug-ins and obtain some demo copies you can test, visit the Adobe Plug-in 
finder Web site. Log on to www.adobe.com/special/acrobat/pluginfinder.html. A 
comprehensive list of third-party plug-ins is also listed at the PluginsWorld Web site. Log on to 
PluginsWorld.com to find third-party products supporting Acrobat.
Summary
 PDFs can be viewed inside Web browser windows. When viewed as inline views in Web 
browsers, Acrobat toolbars and menu options are contained within the browser window.
 You change preferences settings for Web viewing PDFs in Windows in the Acrobat 
viewer Preferences dialog box.
 To make links from text in PDFs for users of Acrobat 6 and earlier, choose Advanced ➪ 
Document Processing ➪ Create Links from URLs.
 To create multiple identical Web links across several pages, use the Add Header and 
Footer dialog box. Type a URL as a header or footer and save the file. Close and reopen 
the file and the links are active in Acrobat viewers 7 and above.

A
mong the many uses for Acrobat PDF files are presentations. Acrobat 
does not provide the robust features for creating title slides, import-
ing text and graphics in an open PDF document, or creating handouts 
such as those found in dedicated slide-authoring programs such as Microsoft 
PowerPoint and Apple’s Keynote. However, if you’re willing to put a little 
work in either designing a slide presentation in a layout program or convert-
ing a slide show from PowerPoint or Keynote to PDF, you can explore many 
other opportunities in Acrobat for making slide presentations dynamic and 
suitable for any kind of audience through the use of file linking, JavaScripts, 
and other interactive elements.
If you’re an Acrobat Pro Extended user (Windows only), you have many 
more options for creating dynamic presentations with Adobe Presenter. 
Adobe Presenter is an add-on support for Microsoft PowerPoint where you 
can add animation, sound, and multimedia, and convert your presentations 
to Flash videos.
In this chapter, you learn some helpful methods for producing PDF docu-
ments suited for presentations and discover some of the power you have 
available for dynamic presentations created with Adobe Presenter.
Setting Up the Work Environment
Interactivity is one element you’ll want to add to documents designed for 
presentations. To add interactive buttons and fields, open the More Tools 
window by selecting More Tools from a context menu and check the 
Advanced Editing toolbar. Deselect any tools you are not likely to use in this 
toolbar such as the Article tool and the TouchUp Reading Order tool. For 
access to all the navigation tools, scroll down to the Page Navigation toolbar

and check all the boxes for the Navigation tools and check the Page Navigation toolbar. You may 
want to import media when creating presentations. Check the box for the Multimedia toolbar. 
Click OK to open the toolbars as floating toolbars.
When using the Advanced Editing tools or the Button tool, you’ll find the Properties Bar a valuable 
asset. To open the toolbar, open a context menu from the Toolbar Well and select Properties Bar. 
After opening the toolbars, open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and select Dock Toolbars.
If you’re familiar with the toolbar icons and don’t need the tool labels, open a context menu on the 
Toolbar Well and select Button Labels ➪ Default Labels. For the figures in this chapter, the toolbar 
labels are displayed (Button Labels ➪ All Labels).
Creating Presentation Documents
The first step in creating presentations for viewing in Acrobat is to decide what authoring program 
you want to use. If you are familiar with either Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple’s Keynote, you can 
create a slide presentation and convert the authoring application file to PDF. For PowerPoint, you’ll 
want to determine whether the PDF conversion is worthwhile. If your slide presentation is about 
Adobe Acrobat, it makes sense to show the slides in Acrobat. If the presentation is about another 
topic, you need to determine if it is more beneficial to display the presentation in an Acrobat viewer 
or directly in PowerPoint. By converting to PDF, you make your presentation available to all Adobe 
Reader users. If you need to pass your presentation through a review committee, you can enable 
the presentation with Adobe Reader usage rights and provide Adobe Reader users the option for 
adding comments and notes to your presentation.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on enabling PDFs with usage rights for Adobe Reader users, 
see Chapter 19.
If you prefer other author applications to PowerPoint or another dedicated slide application pro-
gram, conversion to PDF for showing slides in an Acrobat viewer is an ideal solution. Obviously, 
PDFs offer you more functionality when showing slide presentations than most original authoring 
applications. Ideally, the best authoring applications to create a slide presentation, if you don’t use 
dedicated slide authoring programs, is a layout program such as Adobe PageMaker, Adobe InDesign, 
Adobe FrameMaker, or QuarkXPress. These programs offer you the ability to create documents 
with multiple pages and assign different backgrounds to pages via master pages. In addition, some 
programs offer you the ability to create text blocks on master pages so the text placement, font sizes, 
and paragraph properties are identical on each page.
Converting PowerPoint slides to PDF (Windows)
Microsoft PowerPoint files are converted to PDF in much the same way that you convert other 
Microsoft Office files. The Adobe PDFMaker tool is installed in PowerPoint just as you find with 
many other Microsoft programs.

PDF settings you want to use for your file conversion. For presentations without transitions and 
animations, the Standard Adobe PDF settings should work sufficiently for showing slides on 
screens and overheads as well as printing handouts for your audience. If you want to change the 
compatibility settings, click the Advanced Settings button to custom-design Distiller job options.
NOTE
NOTE
I focus primarily on Office 2007 applications in this book. If you’re an Office 2003 
user, you’ll find the PDFMaker tools installed in Office applications (Windows only) 
as well as menus where you can edit conversion settings. Although the path for choosing options 
is different between the Office versions, the options available to you are very similar.

PDFMaker dialog box, see Chapter 8.
As with the other Office applications discussed in Chapter 8, you click the Create PDF tool in the 
Acrobat Ribbon to convert the slides to a PDF file. Conversion of a PowerPoint slide presentation 
without adding special features is a relatively easy operation.

Converting PowerPoint notes to PDF notes 
(or annotations)
If you want to create notes for your audience, you convert notes to Adobe PDF comments that are 
created on a separate layer. The layer can be shown and hidden in Acrobat. The setup for printing 
notes is handled in the PowerPoint View tab in the Ribbon. Click Notes Page; the current default 
Notes Master displays the notes at the bottom of the document page. Notes you add to each slide are 
added as comments in Acrobat. To convert PowerPoint Notes to PDF comments, do the following:
STEPS: Converting notes to PDF
 
1. Open a presentation in PowerPoint.
 
2. View the Notes page. Click the View tab in the Ribbon and click Notes Page in the top-
left corner of the View tab.
 
3. Add notes to the slides. The current slide is shown at the top of the page. Below the 
slide is a text box. Type your speaker notes in the text box. Scroll the slides and add 
notes to all slides where you want notes added to the respective slide.
 
4. Convert to PDF. Click the Acrobat tab in the Ribbon and click Create PDF. The Save 
Adobe PDF File As dialog box opens. Choose a target folder for your notes file and click 
Save. A dialog box opens and asks you if you want to convert the speaker notes to com-
ments. Click Yes to add the notes as comments on a separate layer in the PDF file as 
shown in Figure 28.2.

Converting handouts to PDF
In PowerPoint you can print handouts to your printer; however, you can’t convert a handout page 
to a PDF document via the Create PDF tool in the Acrobat Ribbon. If you want to print handouts 
and carry the printed documents to your session, it’s best to leave the task to PowerPoint. If you 
want to distribute handouts to session attendees and leave the task of printing to others, then you 
need to convert a handout page to a PDF document.
Here are the steps to accomplish the task:
Steps: Creating PDF handouts
 
1. Set up the Notes pages in PowerPoint. Rather than create a handouts page, use a note 
page in PowerPoint. Follow the steps outlined earlier in the section “Converting PowerPoint 
notes to PDF” to create note pages in PowerPoint, but don’t convert to PDF.
 
2. Open the Print dialog box. Converting to PDF from the Create PDF tool in the Acrobat 
tab won’t do the job. You need to use another method of PDF creation. In the Print dialog 
box choose Adobe PDF as your printer. Choose Notes Pages and Grayscale in the Print 
what section of the Print dialog box as shown in Figure 28.3. If you want a keyline border 
for your slides, check Frame Slides.
 FIGURE 28.3
Open the Print dialog box and choose Notes Pages.

924

3. Create the PDF document. Click OK to open the Save PDF File As dialog box. Open a 
target folder for the saved file and click Save. The notes pages are converted to PDF.
 
4. Create text boxes for the notes pages. If you want users to interact with an electronic 
file, you can add form fields to the PDF. If you want users to print files and have lines 
added to the document, you might create a background comprised of lines for attendees 
to write notes and add the background to the pages in the PDF document. In this exam-
ple I’ll use form fields to prepare a file for electronically adding notes.
 
 In the open PDF document choose Forms ➪ Add or Edit Fields. The interface changes to 
Form Editing Mode. Add a text box field to the first page using the Text Field tool.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on adding text fields to a PDF document, see Chapter 34.
 
5. Change the Text Field Properties. Type a name (any name) for the text field and click 
Properties in the mini properties window to open the Text Field Properties dialog box. 
Click the Appearance tab and set the appearance properties for border and fill color as 
desired. From the Font Size pull-down menu choose a font size. Be certain to not use 
Auto. Choosing Auto sizes text to the size of the field box. If you use different sizes for 
field boxes, the text sizes will appear different.
 
 Click the Options tab and choose Multi-line. Click Close after setting the properties.
 
6. Duplicate the field. Open a context menu on the text field and choose Duplicate. In the 
Duplicate Field dialog box, click the From radio button and type 2 in the first text box. 
Leave the default number in the second text box to duplicate fields from page 2 through 
the end of the document.
 
7. Rename the fields. The duplicated fields have the same name. You need to rename the 
fields in the Fields panel to provide a unique name for each field. Click the field names in 
the Fields panel and type a new name for each field. In my example I use n.1, n.2, n.3, 
and so on, as shown in Figure 28.4.
 
8. Save the file. Click Close Form Editing and review the slides. Test each slide by typing 
data in the field on each respective page to be certain unique data can be added to each 
page. Choose Forms ➪ Clear Form to eliminate the data on each page. Use the File ➪ Save 
As command and overwrite the last saved version to optimize the file.

If you want a different design for your notes to appear under the slide images, you can create any 
kind of design in your favorite authoring program and convert to PDF. Use the design as a back-
ground and use the Document ➪ Background ➪ Add/Replace command to add the design to each 
page in the slide presentation.

Converting PowerPoint slides to PDF (Mac)
A long-standing problem we’ve had ever since the introduction of the PDFMakers is that they just 
don’t work well with PowerPoint on the Mac. As a result, the PDFMakers are gone in Acrobat 9.
To create a PDF from an Office application, use the Print dialog box and print your presentation to 
PDF. Although you can create PDF files by printing to PDF, you’ll struggle to get the right page size 
when converting PowerPoint slides to PDF. On Windows you get the exact page size you specify 
from the default slide page size. On the Mac you get something like a page shown in Figure 28.5.
What’s your alternative? If you happen to have a dual-core Mac and you run a virtual desktop appli-
cation with Windows XP or Vista, you might look into installing Acrobat on Windows running on 
your Mac. If you have a friend or colleague using Acrobat and PowerPoint on Windows, you could 
send your file to your colleague to convert to PDF. Doing so, of course, means that you should both 
be licensed users of Acrobat. The PowerPoint files are easily transferred between computer platforms 
as long as you use fonts available on both operating systems.
Finding a workaround will save you much time and aggravation. Do your best to get a little help in 
converting these files to PDF.
 FIGURE 28.5
Creating PDF files from PowerPoint on the Mac is problematic when you want to create PDFs from slide 
presentations.

Converting Apple Keynote slides to PDF (Mac)
Another option Mac users have for converting PowerPoint slides to PDF is to open them in Apple’s 
Keynote. Keynote is a dedicated slide presentation authoring application that offers a robust 
authoring environment providing simplicity and ease in creating slide shows. The charting features 
in Keynote are easy to use with intuitive palettes for editing chart types and data. Whether you use 
Keynote to convert PowerPoint slides or use it as your original authoring program, Keynote easily 
converts presentations to PDF.
Keynote supports file imports for many image formats, video, and sound, and PDF imports that can 
be sized and scaled. The templates installed with the program are attractive and well designed. After 
creating a slide show in Keynote, choose File ➪ Export. A dialog box drops down from the applica-
tion menu bar where you are offered format options for exporting to QuickTime, PowerPoint, or 
PDF formats. To export directly to PDF format, select the PDF radio button and click Next. Locate 
the folder where you want the PDF file saved and click the Export button. You won’t find Keynote 
giving you the same problems for matching page sizes between Keynote and PDF.
Converting authoring application documents to PDF
Many creative professionals use layout programs for a variety of purposes, including slide presenta-
tions. If you use QuarkXPress, Adobe InDesign, Adobe PageMaker, or Adobe FrameMaker for cre-
ating a slide presentation, you can export your documents to PDF via the same methods used for 
PDF exports when preparing files for print. For notes and handouts, you can create master pages 
in any one of the applications with the graphics, lines, and styles you want, and you can import the 
PDF document into the layout application. Each of the aforementioned programs supports PDF 
imports.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on converting layout program documents to PDF, see 
Chapter 7.
Depending on the program you use, you can either set up master pages with graphic placeholders 
or place and size PDF pages individually. In a program such as Adobe InDesign CS, creating note 
pages is more work than using PowerPoint, but you can create some workarounds for adding notes 
to presentations. You begin by creating a master page with the design you want to use for the note 
handouts. On the master page, add graphic elements such as the lines, text, logo, or other data. 
Next, create a rectangle with the Rectangle Frame tool. In this example the slide pages need to be 
sized down to 75 percent; therefore, I created the rectangle and used the Transformation palette to 
size the rectangle to 75% to accommodate the PDF slide pages.
After creating the template, add pages to the document and assign the template to each page. When 
it comes time to import the slide file, select File ➪ Place. In the Place dialog box, be certain to select 
Show Import Options. When the check box is enabled, InDesign opens the Place PDF dialog 
box, shown in Figure 28.6, where you determine what page is placed.

928

 FIGURE 28.6
To make choices for what page to place in the InDesign file, be certain to enable Show Import Options in 
the Place dialog box. After clicking OK in the Place dialog box, the Place PDF dialog box opens where 
you can scroll pages to place the page of choice.
In the Show Import Options dialog box, click the left- or right-pointing arrows to scroll pages. 
Select a page and click OK. Click the cursor in the area where the rectangle frame was drawn on 
the master page to place and size the PDF page to the exact fit, including scaling. When the page is 
placed, move to the next InDesign page and place the next PDF page.
After placing all pages and using a template master for the design layout, select File ➪ Export. Select 
Adobe PDF in the Export dialog box and export the file to PDF.

Using Adobe Presenter 
(Acrobat Pro Extended only)
Earlier attempts by Adobe for converting PowerPoint animations to PDF have been hit and miss. In 
a few earlier versions of Acrobat the PDFMaker successfully converted animation effects you added 
in PowerPoint and the animations were retained in PDF documents. In other versions of Acrobat, 
the PDFMaker couldn’t convert PowerPoint animations.
If you create PowerPoint presentations with animations such as text in motion, exploding objects, 
fading elements, and so on, and you want to convert these effects to PDF, Adobe provides you a 
solution in the form of Adobe Presenter. Adobe Presenter is a separate installation you find on the 
Acrobat Pro Extended installer CD; Pro Extended is made available only to Windows users.

929
Creating PDF Presentations

When you install Adobe Presenter, a new tab appears in the Ribbon in PowerPoint. Click the 
Adobe Presenter tab to change the Ribbon as you see in Figure 28.7. In Office 2007, you have a 
menu for Adobe Presenter vs. a tab.
 FIGURE 28.7
Click the Adobe Presenter tab in the PowerPoint Ribbon to display the Adobe Presenter tools. Adobe 
Presenter is available only on Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows).
Looking at the Adobe Presenter tools
Adobe Presenter offers you a number of options for creating presentations with animation, sound, 
video; support for PowerPoint animations; and much more. The tools include:
 Publish. The Publish tool is used instead of the Acrobat Ribbon’s Create PDF tool. In 
Presenter you have three publishing options. You can create an Adobe Flash SWF file, 
create a PDF you can host anywhere, or host a PDF on Acrobat.com.
 Slide Manager. The Slide Manager enables you to add navigational links, specify options 
for playing media, adding an author name, and locking slides.
 Settings. The Settings options provide you choices for changing the template design for 
the presentation. You have a number of different designs from which to choose, as well as 
the ability to add custom templates. Playback options are also included as well as control 
over audio quality, image quality, downloading options, and publishing locations. The 
settings also provide you options for adding file attachments that are accessible in Acrobat 
viewers after the presentation is converted to PDF.
 Audio. The Audio section includes 4 tools: Record tool enables you to overlay sound 
from audio you record via a microphone attached to your computer, import sound files, 
sync sound, and edit sound files.
 Video. The Capture tool …. Capture. You can capture video and attach the video to 
different slides or export the video as a separate file. Import Video, Edit Video…
 Flash. Two tools: Insert Swf File and Manage Swf File Insert SWF. This tool permits 
you to import Flash SWF video files.
 Quiz includes 1) Manage, 2) Import and 3) Add New. Manage. The Manage tool is 
used to add Quizzes to your presentation. You have options for adding questions, supply-
ing answers, defining appearances, adding labels, and more.

 Preferences. The Preferences tool opens the Adobe Presenter – Preferences dialog box 
where you can add a photo, logo, and biography, identify servers for sharing your files, 
and determine audio sources.
 Help. The Help tool opens the Adobe Presenter Help guide where you can view help 
information to assist you in working in Adobe Presenter.
Publishing a presentation using Adobe Presenter
Each of the Adobe Presenter tools opens dialog boxes where options choices are made. In several 
cases you have multiple tabs to change panes where more options are found. It is beyond the scope 
of this book to thoroughly cover all options choices you can make in Adobe Presenter. What is 
offered here is a glimpse at converting files to PDF and a discussion on a few of the impressive 
features you have available with Adobe Presenter. To start off with, let’s take a look at converting 
files to PDF using Adobe Presenter.
To convert a PowerPoint file to interactive or multimedia PDF, do the following:
Steps: Converting a PowerPoint file using Adobe Presenter
 
1. Open a PowerPoint document. You might use a PowerPoint document that contains 
animations such as Effects for text and objects.
 
2. Change Settings. Click the Settings tool in the Adobe Presenter tab in PowerPoint. The 
Adobe Presenter – Presentation Settings dialog box opens as shown in Figure 28.8.
 
 By default the Appearance tab is shown. The Summary text box is where you can add a 
document summary. Type the desired text in this box. From the Theme pull-down menu 
choose a theme. If you don’t want to use the existing selection of various themes, click 
the Theme Editor to create custom themes.
 
 Click the Playback tab and make selections for advance intervals, looping the slide show, 
including slide numbers, and setting intervals for pausing the slide show after animations 
are played.
 
 Click the Quality tab to make choices for audio and image quality. You also make a choice 
for publishing the file for your computer, which provides you an HTML version of the 
slide animation, publish for Acrobat Connect Pro, and publishing a PDF. Choose the 
option you want from the Publish For pull-down menu.
 
 Click the Attachments tab to add file attachments to your published work. Click OK 
when finished making choices.

 FIGURE 28.8
Click the Settings tool in the Adobe Presenter Ribbon to open the Adobe Presenter – 
Presentations Settings dialog box where you make a number of choices for exporting 
and viewing the published work.
 
3. Set the Publish attributes. Click the Publish tool in the Adobe Presenter Ribbon to open 
the Adobe Presenter – Publish Presentation dialog box. The first item to check is the left 
side of the dialog box shown in Figure 28.9. You have choices for publishing the work as 
SWF to your computer, to your Acrobat Connect Pro account, or as an Adobe PDF file. 
In my example I use Adobe PDF as my output source.
 
 Click the Choose button to locate a folder where you want to save the export. If you 
select Acrobat Connect Pro, the Choose button changes to Edit Servers where you can 
edit the URL, logon, and password for your Acrobat Connect Pro account.

4. Open the Slide Manager. The Slide Manager enables you to make some choices for the 
display and navigation of the published document. Click Slide Manager in the Adobe 
Presenter – Publish Presentation dialog box to arrive at the Adobe Presenter – Slide 
Manager dialog box shown in Figure 28.10.
 
 Click the Presented By item and choose a presenter from a pull-down menu. You can add 
multiple presenters and edit the Presenter information in the Adobe Presenter - Preferences 
dialog box you access by clicking the Preferences tool in the Adobe Presenter tab. This 
feature is handy when you have multiple presenters for a given session.
 
 Make other choices by clicking items in the Slide Manager. You might want to jump 
around the presentation. You can open a pull-down menu (shown in Figure 28.10) from 
the Go To menu and choose from the list of slides where you want to go next.
 
 Set all the options you want to use and click OK to return back to the Adobe Presenter – 
Publish Presentation dialog box.
 
5. Publish the Presentation. After making all your choices in the various dialog boxes, 
click the Publish button. Your presentation is exported to the location/format you chose 
in your settings.

Examining the interface
I used Adobe PDF as my output source in the previous steps. When you open a PDF document 
exported from Adobe Presenter, such as the one I created (see Figure 28.11), one of the first things 
you notice about the file is that all the slides you published appear on one page. After a first glance you 
may be tempted to return to PowerPoint thinking that you missed identifying a page range for 
exporting the presentation.

934
PDF Publishing
Part V
 FIGURE 28.11
Slides exported from Presenter as a SWF file show the entire presentation on one PDF page
The reason your presentation appears on one page is because the end result is an Adobe Flash file 
that contains all the transitions, effects, and slides inside the Flash animation, embedded in a PDF 
document. As you can see in Figure 28.11, you end up with a beautiful design where you have 
many choices for displaying the animated file.
Some of the areas you’ll want to become familiar with in the Flash interface include:
 Animated effects. In Figure 28.11, notice the last bullet point on the slide. The screen 
shot was captured while text was moving from the left side of the slide. All the effects you 
add in PowerPoint are retained in the PDF file.
 Status bar. The tools appearing at the bottom of the slide enable you to pause the presen-
tation and move forward and backward in the presentation (these tools being represented 
by the arrows). A slide for setting the sound level is represented by the speaker icon on the 
right side of the status bar. The Attachments tool opens the Attachments pop-up panel 
where you can view file attachments. The last tool enables you to toggle views where you 
can display or hide the side panel on the right. When I click the tool shown in Figure 28.11, 
you see the display as it appears in Figure 28.12.

935

Click the last tool in the status bar to change views.
 Outline. The Outline tab in the side panel displays the speaker assigned to the current 
open slide. Below the Slide Title heading you see a list of all the slides in the presentation. 
Click any slide title and you can jump to that slide.
 Thumb. Click the Thumb tab to see a scrollable list of all slides showing a thumbnail 
image of the slides.
 Notes. Click Notes to see speaker notes attached to each slide.
 Search. Click the Search tab and type a search item in the text box. Press Enter/Return 
and the results are reported in the same tab as shown in Figure 28.13. Click a result and 
the result is hyperlinked to the slide where the found word(s) appears. As you click a 
result and jump to another slide, the results remain in view so you can navigate to several 
different slides where results are found without having to repeat your search.
 Time readout. At the bottom of the side panel you find a readout where the time remain-
ing for the slide presentation is reported. This time is based on the interval you set up in 
Adobe Presenter before converting to PDF.

To play the slides click the Play tool in the status bar. In Figure 28.11 you see two parallel lines as 
the first tool. The presentation is currently in a pause mode. Clicking the tool changes the icon to a 
right-pointing arrow. Click the arrow to play the presentation. You can start and pause the Flash 
animation at any time by clicking the Play and Pause tools.
TIP
TIP
You can enter Form Editing Mode on a file converted from Adobe Presenter and 
add form fields to the document. You might want to create a button and set the 
button action to open another file during a presentation. For example, you might want to display 
a financial summary document while addressing an annual shareholders meeting. Because 
Presenter slides all appear on one page, your button is shown as the Flash animation plays and 
changes slide views. If you have multiple buttons or other form fields that you want to add to a 
presentation, you can create separate PDF documents and use the Create PDF task button and 
choose Merge Files into a Single PDF to create one file as a single presentation. On each page 
you can then add button fields that execute different actions.
There’s much more to Adobe Presenter than covered in this chapter. For information related to 
importing sound, rich media, Flash files, creating quizzes, and more features, consult the Adobe 
Presenter Help document.
Working with Page Transitions and Effects
Page transitions can be added in PowerPoint and converted to PDF when you use the PDFMaker in 
PowerPoint either from Acrobat Pro or Acrobat Pro Extended on Windows. You also have options 
for adding transitions directly in Acrobat viewers. Acrobat lacks the ability to provide you anima-
tions with text and images such as text flying in or out of a slide, text rotations, fades and dissolves, 
and so on.

937
Creating PDF Presentations
28
PowerPoint also supports the import of video, sound, and page transitions; and these imports are 
also converted to PDF when using the PDFMaker. You can choose to add video, sound imports, and 
page transitions in PowerPoint that can be converted with Acrobat as well as when using Adobe 
Presenter; or you can use tools in Acrobat Pro or Pro Extended to import media and create page 
transitions in any Acrobat viewer including Adobe Reader.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on working with video and sound in PDFs, see Chapter 23.
Converting animations to PDF from PowerPoint
You can convert imported media to PDF from PowerPoint using Acrobat Pro or Acrobat Pro 
Extended. In PowerPoint you click the Insert tab and click the Movie tool. When you import a 
movie in PowerPoint and use the Create PDF tool, the movie is transcoded to a Flash file.
If you use Acrobat Pro Extended , click the Embed video tool in the Insert Ribbon. The Insert Video 
dialog box opens where you can Browse your hard drive and locate the media file you want to 
import. The media file is transcoded to Adobe Flash upon import. If you import media in a 
PowerPoint presentation in Acrobat Pro Extended, you can export the file to PDF using either the 
Create PDF tool (Acrobat tab) or the Adobe Presenter Publish tool (Adobe Presenter tab).
Adding page transitions in Acrobat viewers
Page transitions are available in Full Screen mode in Acrobat. You can set page transitions for all 
pages in a file or from selected pages in the Pages palette. You can batch-process files and apply 
transitions on a group of documents with a batch command.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on creating batch sequences, see Chapter 18.
To set transitions on all pages or a specified range of pages in a document while remaining in Edit 
mode (as opposed to Full Screen mode) do the following:
STEPS: Adding page transitions to a document
 
1. Open a slide presentation in any Acrobat viewer.
 
2. Open the Pages panel by clicking the Pages icon. Note that in Acrobat, you can add 
page transitions using a context menu or a menu command from the Options pull-down 
menu and selecting Page Transitions. You also have the option of selecting the Advanced ➪ 
Document Processing ➪ Page Transitions menu command.
 
 You might want to use the Pages panel to access the Set Transitions dialog box because you 
can easily select a range of pages or a group of noncontiguous pages, or you can make a 
choice to apply transitions to all pages from selections you make in the Pages panel and 
then easily access the Page Transitions command.

938
PDF Publishing
Part V
 
 If you use Adobe Reader to set page transitions, you don’t have access to menu commands 
from the top-level menu bar or a context menu in the Pages panel. You need to handle 
page transitions settings in the Full Screen Preferences.
 
3. Select pages you want to appear with transitions. If you want all pages to appear with 
transitions, skip this step and move to the next step. If you want only a selected range of 
pages to appear with transitions, click the page thumbnails you want to appear with page 
transitions. For a noncontiguous selection, press the Ctrl/Ô key and click each page you 
want to use.
 
4. Open the Set Transitions dialog box. After selecting pages or when applying transitions 
to all pages, you can choose Page Transitions from a context menu, the Pages panel Options 
pull-down menu, or the Advanced ➪ Document Processing submenu. Any one of these 
choices opens the Set Transitions dialog box shown in Figure 28.14.
 FIGURE 28.14
The Set Transitions dialog box offers you a wide range of choices for transition effects 
you can apply to pages while viewing documents in Edit mode.
 
5. Set the transition attributes. A number of choices are available for applying page transi-
tions. Make some settings adjustments for the following:
 Transition. From the Transition pull-down menu, you select the transition effect to 
be applied for the pages selected either in the dialog box or from the range of pages 
selected in the Pages panel. Acrobat offers you a total of 16 different choices. One 
choice is to set No Transition, with the remaining 15 choices representing different 
effects.

939
Creating PDF Presentations
28
 Direction. Not all transitions use options in the Direction menu. When an option is 
available, open the pull-down menu and select a command for the direction you want 
the transition to move.
 Speed. Make a selection for Fast, Medium, or Slow in the Speed pull-down menu.
 Auto Flip. If you enable Auto Flip, pages are scrolled at an automatic interval 
according to the number of seconds you select from the pull-down menu below 
the Auto Flip check box. Choices for the interval are between –21474833648 and 
+21474833648.00 seconds. You can select fixed interval options or type a value 
within the acceptable range. If you want to manually scroll pages, leave the check box 
disabled.
 Page Range. If you don’t select pages in the Pages tab, use the Set Transitions dialog 
box to apply transitions to All pages in document, or specify a page range in a contig-
uous order by clicking on the Pages range and typing in the page From and To field 
boxes. When you select pages in the Pages panel, the pages become active by default 
and the transitions are applied to the selected pages.
After setting the effects and page range, click OK to apply transitions to the pages when you scroll 
pages in Edit mode.
Although it isn’t necessary with all the features in Acrobat 9, you can apply page transitions in 
authoring applications prior to PDF conversion. If you happen to have an old Acrobat 3 installer 
CD, you’ll find a folder on the CD titled Transitions. The Transitions folder contains EPS files with 
PostScript code to create transitions when pages are scrolled in Edit mode. If you use a layout 
application to create your slide presentations, place one of the EPS transition effects on a master 
page in your layout program and convert to PDF. The transitions are applied to all the pages as you 
scroll through the document. If you elect to use this method, you don’t have the flexibility for 
quickly changing transition effects. The one advantage is that any user of older versions of Acrobat 
can create PDF documents with transitions by using this method.
Using Full Screen Views
Full Screen mode offers you many different viewing options when you want to show a slide pre-
sentation. If your presentation requires a discussion of Acrobat and you want to access tools and 
menu commands, working in Edit mode is the most obvious choice. When you use Full Screen 
mode, the menu bar and tools are hidden from view, but the viewing options and alternatives for 
showing slides in Acrobat are much greater.
Setting Full Screen preferences
The first task in working with Full Screen mode is to set up the environment for showing slides 
by setting the Full Screen preferences. Choose Edit ➪ Preferences (Acrobat ➪ Preferences on the 
Macintosh) or press Ctrl/Ô+K. In the left pane, select Full Screen; the preference choices appear, 
as shown in Figure 28.15. Note that Full Screen viewing can be applied to any PDF document, 
including PDFs that were created using Adobe Presenter in PowerPoint.

To set up the Full Screen view, open the Preferences dialog box and click Full Screen in the left panel.
The preference choices include:
 Current document only. You can set up Full Screen viewing as a default for all files you 
view or apply it only to the current PDF document. When the check box is disabled, 
your settings are applied to any file. When the check box is checked, your settings are 
applied only to the file open in the Document pane.
 Fill screen with one page at a time. Sets the page view to the maximum screen coverage 
by a single page.
 Alert when document requests full screen. You may have noticed that if you click a 
link to open a file or use the Open tool to open a file where the Initial View is saved to 
open in Full Screen mode, a dialog box, as shown in Figure 28.16, asks if you want 
to open in Full Screen mode. This preference choice setting controls a dialog box that 
opens and prompts a user to choose whether to open in Full Screen mode or not. If the 
user clicks Yes, the file opens in Full Screen mode. If the user clicks no, the file opens, 
but it opens in Edit mode.
 Which monitor to use. From a pull-down menu, you have several choices for monitor 
viewing. Some of the menu choices are helpful when displaying presentations on projec-
tion systems. To find out what menu choice works best for you, change the viewing pref-
erence when you prepare a presentation by selecting different menu options before your 
presentation session and when viewing the presentation on a projection system. When 
viewing presentations on your own monitor, leave the default setting as This Monitor.

Check the Alert when document requests full screen check box to open a dialog box 
prompting a user to accept viewing in Full Screen mode.
 Escape key exits. Entering the Full Screen mode is handled by setting the Initial View 
options or by pressing Ctrl/Ô+L. If you want to exit Full Screen view, you can press the 
Esc key when this check box is enabled. Be certain to leave the check box at the default 
switch. If you disable the check box, you need to remember to use Ctrl/Ô+L to exit Full 
Screen view.
 Show navigation bar. When the check box is enabled, icons appear in the lower left 
corner of the screen, permitting you to go to the previous slide or next slide, or exit Full 
Screen mode (third icon). In Figure 28.17 the three arrow icons are visible when this 
preference choice is checked.
 FIGURE 28.17
To display navigation buttons while in Full Screen mode, check the Full Screen prefer-
ence choice for Show navigation bar.
 Left-click to go forward one page; right-click to go back one page. When this check 
box is enabled, you can navigate pages with mouse clicks. For both Windows and 
Macintosh users who use a two-button mouse, clicking the left or right button navigates 
pages in the respective direction.
 Loop after last page. Using this option and the next setting for auto advancing, you can 
set up a kiosk and have the slide presentation continue with auto repetition. After the last 
page is viewed, the presentation begins again, showing the first page and continuing in an 
infinite loop.
 Advance every. If you enable the check box, the slide presentation automatically scrolls 
pages at the interval specified in the field box adjacent to the check box. The values per-
mitted for the interval are between 1 and 60 seconds.

 Background color. Click the color swatch to open the preset color palette, where you 
can make choices for the background color. The background color appears outside the 
slide pages on all pages that do not fit precisely within the monitor frame. If you want to 
use a custom color, click Other Color at the bottom of the palette and select a custom 
color from your system palette.
 Mouse cursor. You have three choices from the pull-down menu for the mouse cursor 
display while viewing slides in Full Screen mode. You can choose from Always Visible, 
Always Hidden, or Hidden After Delay. The Hidden After Delay menu choice shows the 
cursor position when you scroll pages, and then hides it after a short delay (usually a 
two- to three-second delay).
 Ignore all transitions. If you set transitions while in Edit mode and want to eliminate 
the transition effects while in Full Screen view, enable this check box.
 Default transition. From the pull-down menu you have choices for one of 16 different 
transition effects. If you apply a transition in the Full Screen preferences, all pages use the 
same transition. If you select Random from the menu choices, effects change randomly 
as you move through slide pages. If you want to use specific transitions that change for 
selected pages, set the transitions from the Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Page 
Transitions menu command before opening the Preferences dialog box. Disable Ignore 
all transitions and the effects you choose for page transitions applied to selected pages in 
the Pages panel are used when you enter Full Screen mode.
 Direction. This is the same option you have when using the Set Page Transitions dialog 
box. See the section “Adding page transitions in Acrobat viewers” earlier in this chapter.
After setting the Preferences, you can enter Full Screen mode by pressing Ctrl/Ô+L or selecting 
View ➪ Full Screen Mode.
Saving Initial View options for files opening in 
Full Screen mode
If you want your PDF document to always open in Full Screen view, you can control the Full 
Screen view in the Initial View Document Properties dialog box. Settings for initial views are 
made on a document-by-document basis, and the settings you make override an end user’s 
viewing preferences.
To set Initial Views for Full Screen viewing, use the steps that follow.
STEPS: Setting the Initial View for Full Screen viewing
 
1. Open a presentation in Acrobat.
NOTE
NOTE
You can’t change any Document Properties in Adobe Reader even when files are 
enabled with Reader usage rights.
 
2. Press Ctrl/Ô+D to open the Document Properties dialog box.

3. Click the Initial View tab.
 
4. Check the Open in Full Screen mode check box. Note that the choices for Navigation 
tab, Page layout, Magnification, and Window Options have no effect on files opening in 
Full Screen mode. If all of the check boxes are selected, as shown in Figure 28.18, the 
Full Screen view overrides all other Window Options.
 
5. Save the file. Before your new settings are applied to the file, you must save the docu-
ment. Click OK in the Document Properties dialog box and select File ➪ Save As to opti-
mize the file. Click Save to rewrite your file with optimization and save the new Initial 
View options with the file. You must close and reopen the file to see the new Initial View 
options take effect.

Save As to optimize file sizes, see Chapter 11.
 FIGURE 28.18
Full Screen mode overrides all other preference options selected in the Initial View settings.
Scrolling pages in Full Screen mode
To advance through slides when in Full Screen mode, you can use the preference setting to scroll 
pages with mouse clicks. If the preference choice for “Left click to go forward one page; right click 
to go back one page” is disabled, you can scroll pages with keystrokes. By default the mouse cursor 
changes regardless of what preference option you choose. Each time you click the mouse button, 
the pages scroll regardless of whether you have the “Left click to go forward one page; right click to 
go back one page” check box enabled.

TIP
TIP
You may have navigational links on the PDF document and not need users to click 
the mouse button or use the Navigation bar to scroll pages. If this is the case users 
who click outside a button may inadvertently move forward in the document. If you want to dis-
able the advance click, you can do so with a simple JavaScript. Choose Advanced ➪ Document 
Processing ➪ Document JavaScripts. In the JavaScript Functions dialog box, type a name for the 
script and click Add. The JavaScript Editor opens. Type the following script in the JavaScript 
Editor:
app.fs.clickAdvances=false;
Click OK and click Close. Save the file. The next time you open the document the cursor 
advance is disabled.
Press the Page Down or Page Up keys to move forward and backward through slides. In addition, 
you can use the up or left arrow keys to move backward and the down or right arrow keys to move 
forward. Use the Home key to move to the first page and the End key to move to the last page. If 
you want to move to a specific page without leaving Full Screen mode, press Shift+Ctrl/Ô+N to 
open the Go to Page dialog box. Enter the page number to open in the field box and click OK.
Creating interactivity in Full Screen mode
You may have a slide presentation that does not require access to Acrobat menus and tools, but you 
want to show cross-document links. Perhaps you have a presentation about a company’s financial 
status, economic growth, or projected growth and you want to show a financial spreadsheet, another 
PDF document, or a scanned image of a memo or report. The slide show created in PowerPoint 
with the motion objects and viewed in Full Screen mode is what you want, but you also want the 
flexibility for opening other files without leaving Full Screen mode.
Creating links and buttons for cross-document linking
If you want to open a secondary document while in Full Screen mode, you can create links or form 
field buttons to secondary files. When you click the link, the link action is invoked. If opening a 
secondary file, the file link opens in Full Screen mode. After viewing the file, press Ctrl/Ô+W to 
close the file and return to the last slide view, also in Full Screen mode.
To set up a file link, create a link or Button field and select Open a file in the Select Action pull-
down menu. Click the Add button and select the file to open. When the Specify Open Preference 
dialog box opens, select New window, as shown in Figure 28.19. Click OK and click the Close 
button. When you view the file in Full Screen mode and click the button, the secondary file opens 
in Full Screen mode, leaving the slide presentation open in Acrobat.
The same behavior exists with other link actions. You can create a URL link to display a Web site 
while in Full Screen mode by using the Open a web link action. Click the link to open your Web 
browser at the specified URL. When you quit the Web browser, you are returned to the slide pre-
sentation in Full Screen mode. If you use PowerPoint effects and export to PDF using Adobe 
Presenter, the effects are not disturbed.

 FIGURE 28.19
Select New window in the Specify Open Preference dialog box. When you click the link, the secondary 
file opens in Full Screen mode.
Using interactive devices
Another interactivity tool that you can use with Full Screen view is a remote control device. For 
about $50 to $75 US, you can purchase a handheld remote control. The control comes in two 
parts. The control device has two buttons used for moving forward and backward in the slide pre-
sentation. The companion unit is plugged into a USB port on your laptop or desktop computer. 
You open the slide presentation in Full Screen view and click the left or right button to navigate 
slides while you walk across a stage. Some devices also have a button for cursor control. You can 
remotely move the cursor on a slide and click a button that opens a secondary file, Web link, or 
other action associated with the button or link.
When using remote devices, be certain to set your Full Screen preferences to “Left click to go for-
ward one page; right click to go back one page.” The USB devices have two buttons enabling you 
to move backward and forward through your slide presentation. When the check boxes are enabled, 
the back and forward buttons on the handheld device are supported.
Conducting Presentations and 
Online Meetings
Dynamic and real-time delivery of presentations to workgroups, conference attendees, and expo par-
ticipants is extended to online presentations. Adobe’s answer to providing an online viewing environ-
ment is handled through either Acrobat Connect Pro or ConnectNow, a service of Acrobat.com.
The free service you have available is ConnectNow, a service of Acrobat.com. You can have up to 
three other individuals in a meeting room and share your presentation with them. For a more robust 
online meeting where you can make a presentation for up to 2,500 people with much dynamic 
interactivity, Acrobat Connect Pro supports your needs.

A
crobat Connect was a new program Adobe Systems provided in ver-
sion 8 and made accessible from within all Acrobat viewers as well 
as Adobe Bridge CS3. In Acrobat 8 you had two versions of Acrobat 
Connect designed to satisfy remote meeting needs for large organizations 
and individual users. Acrobat Connect Professional is a powerful online col-
laboration program, and Acrobat Connect is a personal collaboration meet-
ing room.
Together with the release of Acrobat 9, Adobe has introduced the separate 
Acrobat.com service. Among the features available with Acrobat.com, you 
have another online collaboration tool called ConnectNow.
Acrobat.com is a collection of online collaboration tools that provide you 
free services for sharing files, sharing reviews, distributing forms, using an 
online word processor and collaborating in online meetings — something 
similar to Web conferencing.
Acrobat Connect Pro is still with us in Acrobat version 9 as a paid service. 
Through the Connect workspace you can host a meeting complete with 
screen sharing on your computer and a host of industrial-strength tools for 
conducting online meetings. ConnectNow is a free service that provides 
some similar features available with the Acrobat Connect Pro service, but 
with several fewer features among which is the limitation of the number of 
people who can attend a meeting. With Connect Pro you can conduct meet-
ings with 1,500 people. With ConnectNow you are limited to hosting meet-
ings with three people — including yourself.

company’s online collaboration needs. In this chapter, I’ll stick primarily to discussing 
ConnectNow as it pertains to serving individual and small group online conferencing.
Setting Up the Work Environment
To follow along in this chapter, just open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and select Reset 
Toolbars. No special tools need to be loaded to access Acrobat.com.
Understanding Acrobat.com
If you read Chapters 4, 21, and 35 you should have some idea of what Acrobat.com is and how to 
log on to find all Acrobat.com services. I briefly discussed using Acrobat.com with Adobe Reader 
in Chapter 4 and conducting shared reviews in Chapter 21, and discuss hosting and tracking forms 
coming up ahead in Chapter 35.
Acrobat.com is your central online workspace for sharing files, collecting data, engaging in review 
sessions, and conducting online collaboration sessions. In regard to online meetings, you have 
three alternatives Adobe Systems offers. These meeting room alternatives include:
 ConnectNow (free service). Using Acrobat.com from any Acrobat 9 or greater viewer, 
you can conduct online meetings as a host and have a maximum of two other partici-
pants. This service is free from Adobe Systems.
 Acrobat Connect (annual subscription fee). In Acrobat 8, Adobe introduced Acrobat 
Connect. Acrobat Connect is a meeting room you use as a subscription service where you 
can host meetings for up to 15 people. This service is still offered by Adobe Systems.
 Acrobat Connect Pro (annual subscription fee). Acrobat Connect Pro is an industrial-
strength application of Acrobat Connect. With Connect Pro you can host meetings of up 
to 1,500 people. Like Connect, this service is acquired through an annual subscription fee.
The content in this chapter is related to Acrobat.com and using the free online meeting room. If 
you need to host meetings with 15 or less people, or meetings with Acrobat Connect Pro that pro-
vides hosting meetings of up to 1,500 and a number of features such as VoIP, integrated audio, 
customizable layouts, multiple meeting rooms per user, and more, then log on to www.adobe.
com/products/acrobatconnect/. The Adobe Acrobat Connect Web site contains informa-
tion about the Connect products, free trial downloads, and online ordering and subscription 
services.
In addition to the meeting room service on Acrobat.com, you also have a place where you can 
upload files to share with other users, invite users to participate in online reviews, submit forms 
and have the forms uploaded to Acrobat.com for data collection and tracking, and more.

949
Using Acrobat.com for Online Collaboration

Using ConnectNow for Online Collaboration
I’ll break this chapter up into two primary areas of discussion — Web conferencing and sharing 
files. To begin with, I’ll cover the Acrobat.com services for Web conferencing. Look at the section 
later in this chapter “Using Acrobat.com for File Sharing” to learn more about sharing files on 
Acrobat.com.
Getting into real-time collaboration
Before I get into using Acrobat.com for Web conferencing, I want to point out one of the outstanding 
features you find with the design of the Acrobat.com services. In Acrobat 8 we had Acrobat Connect 
to allow users to host a meeting. You might have a PowerPoint presentation that you want to step 
through in an online meeting to describe some aspect of your business such as the introduction of 
a new product, a new marketing campaign, a sales meeting, or some similar type of discussion.
Using Acrobat 8 and the PDF documents you created, using Acrobat 8 worked well for an Acrobat 
Connect meeting. The only pauses you experienced was a momentary delay when a new slide 
came into view.
In Acrobat 9 we have a quantum leap in the delivery of PDF files. The PDF audience palette has 
changed over the past several years, and people are asking for more dynamic presentations such as 
those you create with Adobe Presenter as I discussed in Chapter 28, adding Adobe Flash to PDFs 
as I discussed in Chapter 23, and presenting documents in the form of PDF Portfolios as I covered 
in Chapter 12.
If you view the media-rich PDF files in a Web conferencing application like Acrobat Connect, as 
was introduced with Acrobat 8, the meeting participants have to wait for video, manipulation of 
3D objects, and Adobe Flash animations. These files come across the Internet very choppy and 
sluggish and are painfully slow even with the fastest Internet connections.
In Acrobat 9 using Acrobat.com (and the new versions of ConnectNow) Adobe introduces real-time 
collaboration. When you choose File ➪ Collaborate ➪ Send & Collaborate Live, a recipient is invited 
to a real-time collaboration session. Instead of viewing your screen on a remote system and waiting 
for the video to play from the host machine, each participant downloads the same PDF file contain-
ing the video file. When the host triggers something like a play button, the play is sent to other 
users as an event. Instead of the video streaming to other users from the host’s computer, only the 
events are passed to the participants. Each user then watches a video locally but the host controls 
the events. This is real-time collaboration and a huge development edge provided by Adobe.
Setting up an Adobe ID
All the work you do with Acrobat.com requires you to create an Adobe ID. Each time you start a 
session, you need to log on with your ID (email address) and password. For the remainder of this 
chapter, I’ll assume you’ve created an Adobe ID and you can log on to Acrobat.com using your log-
on ID and password.

950

If you don’t have an Adobe ID, choose File ➪ Collaborate ➪ Go to Acrobat.com. Or you can simply 
open your Web browser and log on to www.acrobat.com. The initial screen opens as shown in 
Figure 29.1.
 FIGURE 29.1
Choose File ➪ Collaborate ➪ Go to Acrobat.com to open the Acrobat.com log-on page.
At the log-on Web page you have a choice for the type of activity you want to begin. For Web con-
ferencing, click Adobe ConnectNow and the Adobe ConnectNow pop-up window opens as shown 
in Figure 29.2.
Click Begin and the log-on window opens as shown in Figure 29.3. Type your Email address and 
Password and click Enter Meeting. If you don’t have an Adobe ID, click the Sign Up text at the 
lower-left corner of the pop-up window to create an Adobe ID.
If you want to bypass the log-on each time you access Acrobat.com, you can add your email 
address and password to your Acrobat viewer preferences.

In any Acrobat viewer, open the Preferences dialog box (Ctrl/Ô+K) and click Acrobat.com in the 
left pane. Fill in the email address you used for your Adobe ID and type your password. Check the 
Remember me check box. Also check Always connect when opening documents enabled for live 
collaboration. Setting up the Acrobat.com preferences in this manner eliminates a need to type 
your ID and password each time you log on to Acrobat.com.
NOTE
NOTE
Setting the Acrobat.com preferences is optional. If you use your computer in a 
workgroup where others have access to your computer, you may want to avoid fill-
ing in the Acrobat.com preferences and use a manual logon each time you access the Acrobat.
com Web site. If you are confident that no one can access your computer, go ahead and set up 
the preferences so you can use an automatic logon each time you visit Acrobat.com.
Before you read further in this chapter, be certain to have your Adobe ID confirmed and ready to 
go. Make sure you can log on to Acrobat.com by choosing File ➪ Collaborate ➪ Go to Acrobat.com.
Sharing your computer screen
There are some different options you have for online collaboration. You can choose to share your 
computer screen and control a meeting as a presenter, you can choose to share files for online com-
ment and review, and you can choose to engage in real-time conferencing. To start with, let’s take 
a look at sharing your computer screen in an online collaboration session.
Starting a share session
Acrobat and Adobe Reader 9 make it easy to share your computer screen. Once you enter your 
personal meeting room you have options for controlling a meeting as a presenter, promoting other 
users to a presenter level, taking control over another user’s computer, and allowing another user 
to take control over your computer. Using ConnectNow you have one of two categories to experi-
ence — that of a host, and that of a participant.
To host a session, try following these steps:
Steps: Sharing your screen
 
1. Log on to Acrobat.com. In any Acrobat viewer 9 and above, including Adobe Reader, 
choose File ➪ Collaborate ➪ Share my Screen.
 
2. Log on to Acrobat.com. If you elected to not use an automatic logon by setting up your 
Acrobat.com preferences, log on with your Adobe ID and password. Click the Adobe 
ConnectNow button on the Acrobat.com opening page and click Begin when the pop-up 
window opens prompting you to begin a ConnectNow session. Fill in your email address 
and password to open your meeting room. You can also choose File ➪ Collaborate ➪ 
Share My Screen and you’ll go directly to your meeting room log on.
 
3. Share your screen. The first page you see contains a pop-up window displaying the URL 
for your meeting room as shown in Figure 29.4. Click Close to dismiss the window and 
the Screen Sharing window is displayed as shown in Figure 29.5.

Computer Screen in the Screen Sharing window. Another pop-up window appears. Click 
Share to confirm sharing your computer screen.
NOTE
NOTE
The first time you start sharing your screen, you’ll be prompted to install an add-in. 
Click OK and let the installation complete before proceeding.
 
5 Review the introduction screen. After you click Share in the pop-up confirmation win-
dow, an infor mation window opens as shown in Figure 29.6. Look over the help infor-
mation if this is your first attempt at sharing your screen. You might want to review this 
information in future sessions. When you don’t want this screen to appear, click the Do 
not show this message again check box.
 
6. Click OK. The screen changes again where the ConnectNow Screen Sharing panel opens 
(see Figure 29.7) on your desktop or application window. This panel remains in the fore-
ground no matter what application you launch and is used to control your sharing session. 
In Figure 29.7 a PDF Portfolio is opened in Acrobat in a sharing session. The ConnectNow 
Sharing Panel appears in the foreground. You can minimize the panel by clicking the 
minus (-) icon in the top right corner.
 FIGURE 29.6
Click Share and the Introduction to Screen Sharing window opens.

7. Invite participants. In the Screen Sharing panel click the Invite button shown in 
Figure 29.7.
 
8. Send an email invitation to participants. When you click the Invite Participants button 
in the Screen Sharing panel, your default email client opens with an automated message 
as shown in Figure 29.8. Type email addresses (for up to a maximum of two participants) 
and modify the Subject and Message fields as desired. However, don’t change the URL 
link. When your participants receive your invitation, they only need to click the link to 
take them to your meeting room. Click Send to send the mail to your list of participants.
 
 As participants log on to your meeting, you’ll see buttons appear to Accept or Reject the 
person trying to attend your meeting. Click Accept as each individual you invited logs 
on; your list of participants is shown in the Screen Sharing panel.
 FIGURE 29.7
After sharing your screen, the ConnectNow Sharing Panel opens in the foreground.

9. Start your presentation. When the Screen Sharing panel is open, the application docu-
ment behind the window remains in view for the participants. You see the screen with the 
ConnectNow Screen Sharing panel open as shown in Figure 29.7, but the participants see 
your application window only inside a screen similar to Figure 29.7.
 
 With the Chat panel in view other users can text message questions to you. If you set up 
your session with a phone connection, other users can listen on the phone to your audio. 
If using an application like Yahoo! Messenger or Skype, you can have participants listen 
virtually anywhere in the world to your presentation.
Examining the sharing tools
While you’re sharing your screen the Screen Sharing panel remains open and available to you for 
controlling your sharing session. In Figure 29.8 you see the Screen Sharing panel, which includes 
the following panels:
 Attendees. The host and attendees are listed in this panel.
 Chat. In Figure 29.8, the Chat History panel is open. You type messages in the text box 
at the bottom of the panel to chat with all attendees or selected attendees.
 Shared Notes. Click the plus (+) icon to open the Shared Notes panel. You can type 
notes during your session in this panel and save the text as a text file.

Loading pods
When you log on to your meeting room before you start sharing your screen, you’ll find several 
pull-down menus at the top of the meeting Screen Sharing window. Many of the menu commands 
are covered in the section “Participating in a sharing session” later in this chapter. A few items you 
don’t find when logging on as a participant include the Pods menu and the Invite Participants tool 
Clicking the Invite Participants tool results in the same action as when inviting participants from 
the Screen Sharing panel.
The Pods menu has several menu commands as shown in Figure 29.10, and this menu is available 
only to those who host a meeting.

By default, the Screen Sharing, Chat, Shared Notes, and Webcam pods are open. The Files pod dis-
plays all the files you add as attachments, and the Whiteboard opens the Tools panel discussed 
later in the section “Participating in a sharing session.” The Whiteboard is used to mark up notes 
on a file shared in a session by the host. The recipients have access to drawing tools when a partici-
pant shares a screen and opens the Screen Sharing panel. Clicking the Pause and Annotate button 
opens the same Tools panel as the host has available with the Whiteboard.
Participating in a sharing session
If you receive an email invitation to participate in a sharing session, the only thing you need on 
your computer is a Web browser. Acrobat.com meeting rooms support all Web browsers on all 
platforms. Getting into a meeting is as simple as clicking a URL link in an email message and log-
ging on. When you arrive at a meeting, your screen changes to the view shown in Figure 29.11. At 
this point a message is sent to the host who needs to accept you into the room.
After the host accepts you to enter the meeting room, you see the screen shared by the host as 
shown in Figure 29.12
The meeting room pull-down menus shown at the top of Figure 29.12 also apply to a host sharing 
a computer screen. If you’re a host or participant, there are some settings you’ll want to make 
when you log on to a meeting room.
NOTE
NOTE
One difference you’ll see between the host’s computer screen at log on time and a 
participant is that the host has an extra button in the menu used to invite partici-
pants. The participants cannot invite others to attend a meeting hosted by another individual.
Setting preferences
Open the Meeting pull-down menu when you log onto a meeting and choose Preferences from the 
menu options. The Preferences dialog box opens as shown in Figure 29.13. In this dialog box you 
can make some choices for handling your audio and video equipment, your chat default text size 
and color, and your connection speed.

Share My Computer Screen
Attendees can share their screens in a meeting. The host has control over what screen is shown in 
the meeting room; however, the host needs permission from each participant for screen sharing. 
Choose this menu item so your screen can be shared with others in a meeting.
Share My Microphone
Click the Share My Microphone icon in the menu bar to open the Adobe Flash Player Settings dia-
log box as shown in Figure 29.14. If you want to share your microphone, click Allow and click 
Remember in the Adobe Flash Player Settings dialog box. While you share your microphone, other 
members in the meeting need to turn their microphones off to avoid an echo sound in the audio. 
You can minimize the echo in the audio by clicking the Advanced button in the Adobe Flash 
Player and making some settings choices for handling the audio.

Using the Annotation tools
When a participant shares a screen and the host gives control over the sharing to a participant, the 
participant’s screen changes to a view similar to the host where the Screen Sharing panel opens. If 
a participant clicks the Annotate button in the Screen Sharing panel, the Annotations toolbar

he promise of eBooks has been a roller coaster ride for users, pro-
viders, and would-be authors in recent years. The fall of some 
important content providers, coupled with some not-so-impressive 
display mechanisms, has slowed down an industry that many thought had 
a lot of promise. Notwithstanding hardware-display mechanisms and user 
acceptability, the software used to secure eBooks and make them accessible 
to every potential consumer was not as robust as viewing documents in 
Acrobat viewers.
With the introduction of Acrobat 6, Adobe Systems waved good-bye to the 
Adobe eBook Reader software and offered users, content providers, and con-
tent authors a much more attractive means of creation, protection, and deliv-
ery of eBooks. In Acrobat 7, the eBook branding was changed to Digital 
Editions, but the development and delivery for eBooks remained the same in 
Acrobat 7 as was introduced in Acrobat 6.
In Acrobat 9, Adobe changed the user interface for acquiring and managing 
Adobe Digital Editions (notice the rebranding of Digital Editions, now 
referred to as Adobe Digital Editions). You’ll find the new interface to be 
attractive and intuitive. Adobe Digital Editions are easy to read in the new 
interface, and acquiring new books has been made much easier.
The responsibility for restricting eBook viewing and file exchanging is all 
within the hands of the content provider using special software to guard and 
protect eBooks and any other type of PDF document against unauthorized 
viewing, printing, and file exchanging. In addition, end users can now use an 
Adobe online service to protect their PDFs without using content providers.
Not known as a company that stands on its laurels, Adobe has added some-
thing new to this notion of digital editions. Since the hosting and securing of

documents by content providers has been a roller coaster ride, Adobe added a little something to 
PDFs that takes the need for security and relationships with content providers out of the equation. 
In Acrobat 9 you’ll find a marvelous new feature called Ads for Adobe PDF Powered by Yahoo!.
Setting Up the eBook Work Environment
The Digital Editions menu commands were changed in Acrobat viewers in version 8 and 9. You’ll 
find access to Adobe Digital Editions in Acrobat by selecting Help ➪ Digital Editions. In Adobe 
Reader 9, look at the File ➪ Digital Editions menu command. No special tools are required for 
acquiring or reading Adobe Digital Editions. The Adobe Digital Editions reading mode has its own 
set of tools used for navigating pages, returning to last viewed pages, and opening new books.
Creating eBooks
If you’re an end user who purchases content in the form of eBooks and protected files, you really 
don’t need to know much about how the files are created. If you’re a content provider, then under-
standing the options available to you and the restrictions you can apply to eBooks and any other 
type of PDF file are important to you.
On the user end, you can acquire PDF documents with special encryption that restricts your view-
ing, exchanging, and terms of use without activating your Acrobat viewer. On the content provider 
end, you have a very impressive solution available from Adobe in the form of a server-side product 
that can handle all your Digital Rights Management (DRM) needs.
Adobe Content Server 3
At first view, content providers may feel that Adobe has been fickle in deciding how to handle 
DRM (Digital Rights Management) and restricted use of not only eBooks but also any PDF file. A 
few generations ago we had the Adobe eBook Reader that was a special software tool designed to 
view content that was protected against unauthorized distribution and viewing.
During the initial life cycle of Acrobat 7, we had the Adobe Content Server software that was used to 
restrict viewing and distribution through the use of Digital Editions. On November 30, 2004, Adobe 
discontinued the Adobe Content Server software and introduced the Adobe LiveCycle Rights 
Management ES. What has transpired is not a matter of fickle judgment, but rather, an evolution of a 
very sophisticated solution for any enterprise interested in restricting the viewing of PDF files.
Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management ES
Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management ES (formerly known as Adobe LiveCycle Policy Server in 
Acrobat 8 — www.adobe.com/products/livecycle/rightsmanagement/) is truly a 
marvelous product. With the Rights Management, an enterprise can track the viewing of any PDF file 

977
Using PDFs and eBooks

by any user, set time limits for use, update viewing restrictions, control the online and offline docu-
ment usage, and revoke use at any time. The entire burden for activation and use is placed on the 
content provider, and the end user merely needs the same version of an Acrobat viewer for viewing 
any PDF file.
Acquiring Adobe Digital Editions
With just about every upgrade to Acrobat, you also find upgrades to many Adobe server products. 
With eBooks for example, the previous versions of Acrobat required a content provider to purchase 
the Adobe Policy Server to encrypt eBooks. With Acrobat 8, Adobe announced hosted Adobe Policy 
Services. With Acrobat 9 Adobe has introduced the Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management ES Server. 
(The ES is an acronym for Enterprise Suite).
Adobe’s methods for working with eBooks became much easier in Acrobat 8. Rather than end 
users needing to configure their security settings in Adobe Reader or Acrobat, an FDF file is sent to 
a user. No configurations are needed to view the PDF in a protected environment. All security per-
missions are handled transparent to the end user.
With the use of Create Protected PDF Online, you can create a PDF document with the necessary 
security settings that will protect your content against unauthorized distribution without having to 
use a content provider or the Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management ES. You can send the FDF file 
to the end user complete with the restrictions applied via the Create Protected PDF Online service.

Adobe introduced, in conjunction with Acrobat and Reader 8, a new consumer-optimized application 
for reading and managing eBooks and other digital publications. This new solution, called Adobe Digital 
Editions, replaced the eBook functionality that had been in Adobe Acrobat and Reader 6 and 7. It is a 
standalone application (based on Adobe Flash Player) that is a 2.5MB download.
Adobe Digital Editions is found on the Adobe Labs Web site. To install the Flash Player and activate 
Adobe Digital Editions, select Help ➪ Digital Editions in Acrobat or File ➪ Digital Editions in Adobe 
Reader. You can also log on to www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/?source=

Ads for Adobe PDF
Become your own publisher and give away your eBooks! That’s right. Adobe has provided a way 
for you to bypass content providers, a need for securing documents, and paying royalties to third-
party vendors. It’s all handled through a program that, as of this writing, is in public beta.
Ads for Adobe PDF is a means for you to monetize your documents through a free service pro-
vided by Adobe. You don’t need to worry about protecting files because you’ll want to encourage 
wide distribution. As a matter of fact, the more people who view your files, the more chance you 
have in earning more money.

How it works
Ads for Adobe PDF is a free service available from Adobe. To use the service do the following:
 You need to apply to the program by submitting the application form found on the 
Adobe Labs web site.
 If you are accepted into the program, you’ll receive an email containing instructions on 
how to create your account.
 Submit your PDF documents to Adobe. Log on to Adobe Labs at http://labs.
adobe.com/technologies/adsforpdf/.
 Set up an account on the Adobe Labs Web site by following the Getting Started steps. 
In addition you’ll find a list of FAQs, information on earning money, and general help 
information.
 Upload your file(s) to the Adobe service via the service web site URL.
 The Adobe service analyzes your files to enable Yahoo! ads to be matched and displayed 
in the PDF document as shown in Figure 30.6.
 Download the ad-enabled PDF document and distribute it on your Web site or via email.
Each time a reader of your eBook clicks on an ad, you earn money.

Using PDFs and eBooks

Currently, there is one set of ads that show up for an entire PDF and appearing on all pages. 
However, by the time you have this book in your hands, Adobe will have upgraded the service to 
provide you with options for displaying page-specific ads.
What makes this next upgrade attractive is that ads are added to each page in your document rela-
tive to the content on the respective page. For example, if you have an eBook about how to lower 
your golf handicap and you talk about golf courses on page one, the ads on page one might show a 
list of golf clubs and golf resorts. Turn to page two where you talk about the golf grip and you 
might find ads related to golf gloves. Move on to page three where you talk about driving long dis-
tances and you might find ads related to drivers and long-distance golf balls. In short, each page 
displays ads according to the content displayed on the page.
Adobe also built in a way for you to be selective about the kind of ads you want shown in your 
eBooks. If you’re Toyota, you won’t want ads popping up from competitors such as Ford and 
Chevrolet. You have choices for blocking out competitor ads and selecting the kinds of ads you 
want to include in your files. All the questions you may have about Ads for Adobe PDF are 
answered on the Adobe Labs Web site.
Editing PDF documents with ads
When Adobe creates the sidebar that supports the Yahoo! ads, the ad metadata are digitally signed 
to prevent tampering. This prevents another user from cracking the metadata and redirecting reve-
nue elsewhere.
Any content changes are viewed as tampering and the signature is corrupted. Therefore, if you 
need to edit a file such as changing anything on the document pages, inserting new pages, deleting 
pages, or replacing pages, the ads are invalidated. You need to resubmit an edited file to the Adobe 
service to have the document re-enabled with ads.
When you prepare PDF files for distribution, be aware that you need to make all edits on your files 
before submitting them to Adobe for enabling the files with Yahoo! ads. If you want to distribute 
files on CD-ROM or the Web and you want links to open and close files or use URL links, you 
must add these link actions before the files are edited by Adobe. Adding link actions on files with 
ads disturbs the metadata signature and breaks the ad links.
If you have eBooks of substantial size you may need to break up the eBooks into chapters and use 
a contents page to link to the various chapters. As of this writing PDFs with Yahoo! ads are limited 
to files of 10MB or less.

O
ne of the primary problems many Acrobat users experience is print-
ing files with proper color. Notwithstanding any problems with 
printing fonts and getting a print out, the most problematic issues 
with printing PDFs that contain graphic images is accurate reproduction of 
color. Whether you are a creative professional or a novice to graphic design, 
some basic issues need to be understood when printing any kind of docu-
ment containing images or other graphics to a desktop color printer.
This chapter is concerned with printing to local printers of the desktop vari-
ety from Acrobat viewers, and remarks made in this chapter are not intended 
for commercial printing. For professional printing and prepress, take a look 
at Chapter 32.
Setting Up the Work 
Environment
No special editing tools are required for desktop color printing. There is a 
special toolbar for Print Production, but you won’t need any of the Print 
Production tools to print to your desktop printer. To maximize your space in 
Acrobat, reset the toolbars to their default positions. Open a context menu 
on the Toolbar Well and select Reset Toolbars.

Understanding Color Management
Quite a bit can be said about color management, and certainly more attention can be devoted to it 
than I have room for in this book. Quite simply, there are three basic areas you need to address in 
creating a color-managed workflow:
 Monitor calibration. There are software tools on both Windows and the Mac that can 
help you calibrate your monitor to eliminate color casts and color tints and set the gamma 
(neutral midtone grays) of your monitor. I won’t talk about them because most are use-
less on LCD-type monitors, and many people are using LCDs these days. Ideally you 
would use a calibration device. For low-end color calibration of monitors you can 
purchase the Pantone Huey (www.pantone.com/products/products.asp?
idArea=2&idProduct=103) or ColorVision Syper2express (http://spyder.
datacolor.com/product-mc-s2e.php) calibrator for as low as $69 US. More 
sophisticated calibrators such as Gretag Macbeth EyeOne 2 calibrators are above $250 
US. I’ll leave it up to you as to how far you want to go with calibrating your monitor, 
but I strongly recommend that if color output is important to you that you at least 
purchase one of the low-end color calibration devices.
 Color workspace. Whether you work in Acrobat or in an imaging program like Adobe 
Photoshop you need to set up your color workspace. Selections for color workspaces vary 
with programs. The two primary workspaces are Adobe RGB (1998) or sRGB. Choices 
vary according to the files you prepare and the printing equipment you use.
 Output color profile. Each printer and every paper you print on should have a defined 
color profile. Color profiles are often installed with your printer. You can also acquire or 
create custom color profiles to print to a specific paper on your printer.
NOTE
NOTE
Creating custom printer profiles requires more expensive color calibration equip-
ment. For a source of calibration equipment, take a look at the Gretag MacBeth 
Web site at www.xrite.com/.
Don’t be concerned yet about which profile to use. More important, try to understand how these 
three items interact with each other and what they do. First off, your monitor color profile created 
with a hardware device adjusts the overall brightness of your monitor. When you print a file, you 
want to be sure that the print outputs are not darker or lighter than the images you see on your 
monitor. A balance needs to be made between monitor and output so you can safely judge what a 
print looks like when you print to your printer.
Color workspace affects how you view color on your monitor. You want to try to get as close to 
seeing all the colors that can be reproduced on your printer. This happens when you choose the 
proper color workspace. You then select a color output profile when it comes time to print your 
file. Your color is converted from your workspace color to your printer’s colorspace so that all the 
colors fit within the output space as closely as possible. Quite simply, if you see a bright red color 
on your computer monitor and the overall brightness matches your output, you want to be certain 
that same color red gets printed on your printer. This happens when the color is converted from 
your monitor workspace to your printer’s colorspace.

987

Assuming you can set up your color environment to handle monitor color, workspace color, and 
output color, the next thing to understand is how color is managed at print time. You have some 
choices here. You can choose to manage color at print time through your printer, by selecting a 
printer profile, or by printing a converted color file that requires no color management. This is the 
one item that is most confusing for people to grasp — when to manage color at print time and 
when not to manage color. For the answer and examples, I’ll cover that when we look at printing 
to specific printers later in this chapter.
Selecting a Color Workspace
Your first step after calibrating your monitor in creating a color managed workflow is to choose 
your color workspace. In Acrobat open the Preferences dialog box by pressing Ctrl/Ô+K. In the 
left pane, click Color Management and the right pane changes to the view shown in Figure 31.1.
 FIGURE 31.1
Click Color Management in the Preferences dialog box to access the Color Management options.
In the Working Spaces section, open the RGB pull-down menu and choose your RGB color work-
space. Here you have one of two choices:
 sRGB. The name is much longer, as you see in Figure 31.1, but I’ll use the abbreviated 
label and simply call this by the common term — sRGB. Traditionally, this color workspace 

988
PDF Publishing
Part V
has been used when files are prepared for screen and Web viewing. This colorspace comes 
as close as you can get from all the choices available to represent color consistently across 
all monitors. Of course, there are many variables that prevent you from matching color 
exactly on all monitors. We’ll assume the software engineers are telling us the truth when 
they say that the best monitor color matching is made by selecting the sRGB colorspace.
 
More important, you should be aware that many desktop color printers convert color 
from sRGB better than other workspaces. Some online photo services and photo service 
providers may ask you to keep your files in sRGB. For example, if you send photos to a 
Costco store to print on their Noritsu photo printers, they’d ask you to keep your files in 
sRGB. At the desktop printer level, you’ll need to either run tests or take a look at your 
printer’s user manual to find out if your printer supports sRGB better than other color 
workspaces.
 Adobe RGB (1998). The Adobe RGB colorspace has a wider color gamut than sRGB 
(meaning you can see a bit more colors in this workspace). If you prepare files for press 
and commercial printing, you’re best off using Adobe RGB. Also, some desktop color 
printers can take advantage of the wider color gamut, so your printer might give you 
more accurate color matching when converting your files from Adobe RGB to your print-
er’s color output profile. Again though, you need to run tests or turn to the user manual 
to see what the manufacturer recommends.
If all your work is designed for output to desktop color printers using an RGB colorspace, you 
don’t need to be concerned about the CMYK choices in the Color Management preferences. If you 
prepare files for press and commercial printing, then CMYK will be a consideration. Make a choice 
for the color workspace recommended by your commercial printer. If using print shops in the 
United States, the U.S. Web Coated (SWOP) v2 profile is likely to be your best choice. But be sure 
to talk to your print shop technicians first.
On Windows, set the Grayscale option to Gray Gamma 2.2, and on the Mac, set the Grayscale to 
Gray Gamma 1.8. Clear the check box for Output Intent overrides working spaces if your PDF files 
do not contain embedded Output Intent profiles. 
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on output intent profiles, see Chapter 10.
For the Conversion options, select Adobe (ACE) for the conversion engine. On Windows, you’ll 
have a choice for Adobe (ACE) or Microsoft ICM. On the Mac, you’ll have choices for Adobe (ACE) 
or Apple Colorsync or Apple CMM. Use the Adobe (ACE) color engine for the best results. 
Finally, check the box for Use black point compensation. Checking this option gets you closer to a 
rich black.
Click OK in the Preferences dialog box after you make all your choices and your color settings stay 
intact until you change them again.

Using Color Output Profiles
Color output profiles come in a number of different flavors. You can use color output profiles sup-
plied by your printer manufacturer that are installed with your desktop printer, use color profiles 
created by paper manufacturers that are designed for use with specific printers, or create custom 
profiles for your printer and the papers you use.
NOTE
NOTE
There are several services available to you for creating custom color output profiles. If 
you’re a creative professional, you might want to look at using a service to prepare a 
custom profile for your printer and the papers you use. Just go to the Internet and search for cus-
tom profiling services. Custom color profiles are offered as low as $25 US. The cost is minimal con-
sidering all the consumables you’d waste running tests to get color right on your equipment.
Because most users printing from Acrobat are likely to use printer profiles that were shipped with 
their desktop printer, I’ll stick to talking about these profiles. If you’re a creative professional who 
depends on accurate color proofing, take a look at Color Correction For Digital Photographers Only 
(Wiley Publishing, 2006) or Color Correction For Digital Photographers For Dummies (Wiley 
Publishing, 2007). There’s much more to color profiling than can be described here, so a little 
research can help you get closer to producing accurate color.
When you print your PDF files to your color desktop printer, you make a choice for using a color 
profile at the time you print your file. You may see a list of color profiles in the Advanced Print 
Setup dialog box or you may only see the name of your printer. If you see just your printer’s name, 
color profile selection is made automatically by the print driver. Choosing a paper in your print 
driver options tells the printer what profile to use, hence the color profile choice is automatic. 
Regardless of how the color profile is selected, a color conversion takes place from your color 
workspace to the colorspace of your printer. In essence, the conversion is an attempt to fit all the 
color you see on your monitor into the printable colorspace on your printer with as close a match 
as possible.
Some Printing Basics in Acrobat
Before you start printing files to your printer, there are a few toggles and switches you need to verify. 
If you don’t have some options enabled, you may have a more difficult time printing your docu-
ments. The essentials for setting up your printing environment and some toggles you should under-
stand are as follows:
 Turn Show page thumbnails in Print dialog ON. A preference choice appears in the 
General preference settings that controls the print preview in the Print dialog box. A 
thumbnail preview helps you determine whether the page will print without clipping off 
edges. As a matter of default, you’ll want the print preview enabled. Press Ctrl/Ô+K to 

990
PDF Publishing
Part V
open the Preferences dialog box and click General in the left pane. In the right pane, 
check the box where you see Show page thumbnails in Print dialog, as shown in Figure 
31.2. Click OK to dismiss the Preferences dialog box.
 FIGURE 31.2
Check Show page thumbnails in Print dialog in the General preferences.
 Set the print attributes. Several settings in the Print dialog box shown in Figure 31.3 are 
globally set for all printing on desktop printers. These options are as follows:
 Printer selection. From the Name pull-down menu, select the printer you want to 
output your file.
 Comments and Forms. Above the Preview area, you see the section Comments and 
Forms. For printing composite prints without any comments or markups, select 
Document from the pull-down menu. For printing with these markups, see the sec-
tion “Printing Comments, Forms, and Summaries” later in this chapter.
 Page Scaling. Ideally, you should print files to papers large enough to accommodate 
your document page size. If your document fits on a standard page size, select None 
for Page Scaling. If you do need to shrink a document to fit a paper smaller than the 
document page size, select Shrink to Printable Area or Fit to Printable Area from the 
Page Scaling pull-down menu. If you need to tile pages, you can make selections for 
tiling in the same pull-down menu.
 Page Orientation. On Windows, click the Properties button in the top right corner of 
the Print dialog box to select either Portrait or Landscape Orientation. Note that you 
can also select orientation and page size by selecting File ➪ Page Setup before you 
open the Print dialog box.
 Booklet Printing. Open the page Scaling pull-down menu and select Booklet Printing 
to print spreads as shown in the Preview Composite in Figure 31.3. You can choose 

991
Printing to Desktop Color Printers
31
from three additional options for printing booklets. Print Both sides, Front side only, 
or Back side only. On desktop printers capable of printing two sides, you can print 
first on one side, turn the paper over, and print on the second side.
 Tile large pages. This option is a great benefit for those who send files to service centers 
for printing on large format inkjet printers. When you need a proof on your desktop 
printer for an oversized print, you can print multiple pages of tiled sections of the larger 
image. You have choices for displaying cut marks, overlap areas, and scaling.
 Tile all pages. Choose his option to tile all pages in a document.
 Multiple pages per sheet. You can reduce the number of pages printer to fit a given 
number of pages per sheet. You have options for customizing the number of pages per 
sheet and the page range per sheet. 
 FIGURE 31.3
Select your printer from the Name pull-down menu. Booklet printing can be chosen 
from the Page Scaling pull-down menu.
You have some other options in the print dialog box for page range, reversing pages, using auto 
rotations, choosing a paper source by page size, printing to a file, and so on. All these other 
options are very similar to printing from other programs and should be familiar to you.

Who’s Going to Manage Color?
Acrobat offers you three different options for managing color. Your choices appear when you open 
the Print dialog box (Ctrl/Command+P) and click the Advanced button. In the Color Management 
pane open the Color Handling pull-down menu and find see the options shown in Figure 31.4. 
The three choices include:
 FIGURE 31.4
Open the Print dialog box, click on Advanced, and click Color Management in the left pane. Open the 
Color Handling pull-down menu to find your options for managing color at print time.
 Acrobat Color Management. This choice gives the control for managing color to 
Acrobat. If you make this choice, you need to turn off color management in your printer 
driver.
 
If you don’t turn color management off at the last stage (in the printer driver), you wind 
up with a double profiled print. This results in a severe color shift and color output very 
different than your monitor view. (See the sidebar in this chapter for more on printing 
with color shifts.)
NOTE
NOTE
See the section Printing to Desktop Printers later in this chapter to learn how to 
turn color management on and off in the printer driver).
 Same As Source (No Color Management). If you convert an image in a program like 
Photoshop to your color output profile, the color is ready for output and no further con-
version is needed. Because the color is already converted to your printer’s color, you need 
to turn color management off throughout the print process. Most likely you won’t be 
working with files that have embedded color output profiles in the images; therefore, you 
won’t need to worry about printing using this option. If, perchance, you do work with 
images that have color converted to a printer profile, you would make this choice.
 Printer Color Management. When you make this choice in your Advanced Print Setup 
dialog box, you enable the printer to choose the color profile; however, using this option 
only works with PostScript printing devices. If this choice is selected, you can manage the 

993
Printing to Desktop Color Printers
31
color in the advanced print settings in your color printer driver. Typically, you’ll find this 
option to work only when using PostScript printers. As a general rule, for non-PostScript 
printers, you need to use the Acrobat Color Management and choose sRGB color as your 
color profile.
CROSS-REF

For more information on selecting profiles in the Advanced Print Setup dialog box, 
see the next section, “Printing to Desktop Printers.”
When printing from Acrobat you most often have one of two choices to make. Either enable your 
printer to determine color, or enable Acrobat to determine color. If you choose to enable your 
printer to manage the color, you turn color management on. If you enable Acrobat to manage the 
color, you turn color management off. However, where you turn color on and where you turn 
color off varies differently between color printers. To demonstrate how color is managed, we need 
to look at printing Acrobat files from a few different desktop color printers.
Printing to Desktop Printers
Print settings vary according to manufacturers, and I can’t hope to cover all printers in this chapter. 
For a representative sample, I’ll use three of the more popular color printers to show you how to 
print files from Acrobat. To demonstrate how color profiling is handled, I’ll use Epson, HP, and 
Canon printers as examples. If you have a different color printer, you should be able to understand 
the process and apply similar choices when printing to your color printer.
When you install your printer driver, the installation utility may also install a number of color pro-
files. In some cases, individual profiles won’t be installed — all depends on your printer and the 
printer driver. If individual color profiles are not installed, then your printer driver contains profile 
information and makes profile choices within the driver itself. For profiles installed with your 
printer, you can choose profiles in Acrobat’s Advanced Print Setup dialog box and control all the 
printing using a profile provided by your printer manufacturer.
You have a choice for how these profiles are used. You can choose to select the profile in the Print 
dialog box, or you can choose an automatic method where the manufacturer created a no-non-
sense process of automatic profile selection using your printer driver. The color profile is automati-
cally selected when you choose the paper source.
Printing to Epson printers
For the first example I’ll use Epson printers to demonstrate how to print a PDF file from Acrobat 
using the printer to manage color and using Acrobat to manage color. Because the dialog boxes dif-
fer so much between platforms, I’ll include printing from Windows and from the Mac in separate 
descriptions.

Printer profile selection on Windows
In this first example, let’s take a look at how to print to an Epson low-end color printer on 
Windows while allowing the printer to manage the color. Depending on the model of your printer, 
you may see some slight differences in menu names, but the process will follow the same steps.
To print to an Epson printer while enabling the printer to manage the color, follow these steps.
STEPS: Printing from Windows enabling Acrobat to manage color
 
1. Open the Print dialog box. Select File ➪ Print or press Ctrl/Ô+P to open the Print dialog 
box shown in Figure 31.5.
 
 Make all the attribute choices for printing to your printer as was described in the section 
“Some Printing Basics in Acrobat” for page orientation, page scaling, and so on.
 
2. Select your printer. Open the Name pull-down menu and select your printer as shown 
earlier in Figure 31.3.
 FIGURE 31.5
Select your printer from the Name menu in the Print dialog box.
 
3. Open the Advanced Print Setup dialog box. Click Advanced in the Print dialog box.
 
4. Select the color profile. Click Color Management in the left pane of the Advanced Print 
Setup dialog box and open the Color Handling pull-down menu shown in Figure 31.4. 
From the menu options, choose Acrobat Color Management. This choice tells Acrobat to 
manage the color.
 
5. Choose a color profile. When using Acrobat to manage the color, you need to choose a 
color profile from the Color Profile pull-down menu. From the menu choices choose 
sRGB IEC61966-2.1. This choice is not an accurate profile for your printer and paper but 
it servers as a generic profile that works best for most low-end devices.
 
6. Return to the Print dialog box. Click OK in the Advanced Print Setup dialog box to 
return to the Print dialog box.
 
7. Open the printer driver dialog box. At this point we have made all our settings in the 
Acrobat workspace. Now, we need to make choices in the printer driver to decide how 

995
Printing to Desktop Color Printers
31
the color is managed. Because we do not want the printer to manage the color, we’ll ver-
ify settings to insure that indeed the printer does not manage the color.
 
 Click Properties in the Print dialog box to open the Printer Properties dialog box. In this 
example, I use an Epson Stylus C59 printer. The Epson C59 is a very low-end printer that 
doesn’t ship with custom color profiles. Therefore, the only choice I have for managing 
color is to let Acrobat manage the color and choose a generic color profile such as sRGB.
 
8. Choose the paper source. This first choice determines the amount of ink to be used for 
your print. If printing to a glossy paper, more ink is used. If printing to a plain bond paper, 
less ink is used. From the Type pull-down menu, make the paper choice for the paper you 
use. In this example, I use Premium Glossy Photo Paper as shown in Figure 31.6.
 FIGURE 31.6
Select the paper source you use to print your files.
 
9. Don’t Color manage your output. Now it’s time to color manage your file, and this step 
is critical in your print production workflow. For the Epson printer without a color pro-
file available for your paper choice, you need to click on the Advanced button shown in 
Figure 31.6 that opens a warning dialog box. Simply click Continue to open the 
advanced settings dialog box as you see in Figure 31.7.

996
PDF Publishing
Part V
 FIGURE 31.7
Click Advanced, and then click Continue to access the advanced settings in the Epson 
print driver.
 
 A few choices need to be made in this dialog box. The most important are as follows:
 Select a paper type. Choose the same paper here as you did back in Step 7.
 Turn color management off. Because we are enabling Acrobat to determine the color, 
we need to be certain the Color Controls radio button is disabled. This setting tells 
Acrobat to manage color using the color profile we selected in Step 5.
 If you frequently print files using the same settings, you can save your settings by 
clicking the Save Setting button.
 
10. Print the PDF. Click OK and OK again in the Print dialog box and your file is sent to 
your printer. The color is converted automatically from your source workspace of sRGB 
or Adobe RGB (1998) to the profile the Printer Driver automatically selects for you.
Printing from the Macintosh enabling Acrobat to determine color
On the Macintosh the Epson Printer Driver offers you some different settings although the process 
is quite similar. Again, we are going to use the automatic method for color conversion and allow 
the print driver to handle the conversion.
The Acrobat Print dialog box settings and the Advanced Print Setup dialog box settings are identi-
cal on the Mac as you find in Windows. You make choices for paper orientation, page scaling, and 
so on in the Print dialog box and choose Printer/ Color Management in the Advanced Print Setup 

997

31
dialog box just as Windows users. However, on the Mac you don’t have a Properties button. All 
color management choices are made directly in the Acrobat Print dialog box.
To print to an Epson printer when enabling the Printer to manage color, do the following:
 
1. Select Print Settings. Select File ➪ Print and make the same choices as Windows users 
for print attributes and select Printer Color Management in the Advanced Print Setup dia-
log box.
 
2. Select your printer. At the top of the Acrobat Print dialog box you make a choice for 
your printer from the Printer pull-down menu, as shown in Figure 31.8.
 FIGURE 31.8
Select your printer from the options listed in the Printer pull-down menu.
 
3. Select the Media Type and Print Quality. Where you see Copies & Pages, click to open 
a pull-down menu and select the option for Print Settings. In the Print Settings pane, you 
make selections for Media Type and Print Quality as shown in Figure 31.9. In this exam-
ple, I use an Epson Stylus C62 printer and choose Premium Glossy Photo Paper and 
select Best Photo from the Print Quality pull-down menu.
 
4. Choose how to manage the color. Now it’s time to select the color management 
method. From the pull-down menu where you now see Print Settings, click to open the 
menu and select Color Management, as shown in Figure 31.10.

 Click Off (No Color Management). Making this choice tells the print driver to not man-
age the color. 
 
5. Print the file. Click Print and the file is printed to your printer with an automatic color 
conversion from your workspace color to the printer color profile.
Selecting a custom printer profile
Your second method for managing color when printing files is to select a printer profile installed 
with your printer driver or a custom profile you create using a color profiling system. You choose 
from the available list of color profiles in the Color Profile pull-down menu. Whereas the last sec-
tion used a generic profile, this time we’ll let Adobe Acrobat manage the color using a custom color 
profile. Again, the Windows options and Macintosh commands vary a little, so I’ll discuss how to 
print by selecting a profile for each operating system.
Printing using a custom printer profile on Windows
The steps are the same as those described in printing files for automatic profile selection when set-
ting up the page and selecting a printer. When you select File ➪ Print, you open the Acrobat Print 
dialog box as described in the previous section. Your steps now change when you enable Acrobat 
to handle the color conversion and you proceed through the Print dialog box as follows:
STEPS: Using custom color profiles on Windows
 
1. Choose Acrobat Color Management. Open the Print dialog box and click Advanced. 
Click Color Management in the left pane and choose Acrobat Color Management from 
the Color Handling pull-down menu.
 
2. Select a color profile. Note that the Color Profile pull-down menu becomes active when 
you choose Acrobat Color Management. From the Color Profile pull-down menu, select 
the color profile designed for use with the paper you have chosen to print your image. In 
this example, I use a fine art paper color profile as shown in Figure 31.11.

3. Open the printer Properties. Click Properties and the properties settings for your 
selected printer driver open. Check the radio button for Best Photo. From the Type pull-
down menu, select the recommended paper choice. Note: If you use a custom color pro-
file, the profile is usually shipped with guidelines for selecting proper paper.
 
4. Manage the color. Click Advanced and click Continue to arrive at the same dialog box 
shown earlier in Figure 31.7. The paper choice selection is automatically carried over 
from the previous properties dialog box (from Step 1). A different setting is in the Color 
Management section. This time click the ICM (Image Color Management) radio button 
and click Off (No Color Adjustment), as shown in Figure 31.12. Because you selected the 
color profile in Step 1, and you are enabling Acrobat to manage the color, you need to be 
sure that Color Management is OFF. If you don’t turn color management off, you end up 
double profiling your print.
 FIGURE 31.12
Click ICM and click Off (No Color Adjustment).
 
5. Print the file. Click OK and click Print to print the file.
Printing using a printer profile on the Macintosh
All the steps to print a file enabling Acrobat to manage color are the same as Windows until you 
get to the printer driver. On the Mac, do the following to print a PDF document enabling Acrobat 
to manage color.
STEPS: Enabling Acrobat to Manage Color on the Macintosh
 
1. Set the print attributes. Follow the same steps to make choices for the print attributes 
and your printer. Go to the Advanced Print Options and select a printer profile for your 
target paper.
 
2. Set the Print Settings. Use the same settings, as shown earlier in Figure 31.9, to select 
the Media Type and Print Quality.
 
3. Make a choice for Color Management. Click Print Settings and select Color 
Management from the pull-down menu in the Print dialog box. This time, because we 
chose a color output profile and Acrobat is determining the color, we turn color manage-
ment off. In the Color Management pane, select No Color Adjustment, as you see in 
Figure 31.13.
 
4. Print the file. Click Print to print the file.

Printing to HP inkjet printers
Regardless of the printer you use, the process for printing follows the same logic. Unfortunately 
each manufacturer uses different dialog boxes and different menu command names that can leave 
you completely confused if you try to apply steps from printing to one printer to a different 
printer.
The two methods for managing color (enable the printer driver to determine color by selecting 
Printer Color Management, or enable Acrobat to determine color by selecting a specific color pro-
file) are applied to all printers but the dialog boxes, buttons, and menu choices appear differently. 
The critical steps you need to be concerned about when printing files is the profile selection, the 
paper selection, and when to turn color management on or off. If you own an HP printer you 
probably know where to make your paper selection and your best photo selection. The more 
obscure setting is likely to be the color management choice. Rather than discuss each detail step for 
printing to an HP low-end desktop printer, let’s take a look at how to manage color.
Printing to HP printers on Windows
Again, you have two choices as follows:
 Let your printer determine color. For PostScript printers, you use this option. Select 
Printer Color Management in the Advanced Print Setup dialog box. Click Properties to 
open the printer driver properties. Click the Advanced tab when you arrive at the printer 
driver properties dialog box. Click Graphic and click Image Color Management. From the 
ICM Method pull-down menu, select ICM Handled by Printer, as shown in Figure 31.14.
 Let Acrobat determine color. Select a color profile in the Advanced Print Setup dialog 
box and select ICM Disabled in the Advanced tab in the HP printer driver properties.
Printing to HP printers on the Macintosh
HP has come a long way with printing to the Macintosh. The HP Next Generation Inkjet Print 
Products have a number of color management solutions for Macintosh users working with newer 
HP printers such as ColorSmart/sRGB shown in Figure 31.15. Rather than go into detail here, log

Printing to Canon printers
Again we follow the same logic and choose to either enable or disable color management. With 
Canon color printers, the area in the print driver dialog box is even more hidden than you find in 
Epson and HP desktop printers. 
Printing to Canon printers on Windows
Using the same two options you control color management as follows:
 Let your printer determine color. Select Printer Color Management in the Advanced 
Print Setup dialog box. Click Properties in the Acrobat Print dialog box and click Manual 
for Color/Intensity in the Main tab, as shown in Figure 31.16.
 
Click the Set button to open the Manual Color Adjustment dialog box. Check the box for 
Enable ICM (Windows Color Management), as shown in Figure 31.17.
 Let Acrobat determine color. First select your printer profile in the Advanced Print 
Setup dialog box and follow the same steps as above. This time uncheck the Enable ICM 
(Windows Color Management) check box.

 FIGURE 31.19
Select BJ Standard for printer color management and None when you select a printer profile.
Printing Comments, Forms, and 
Summaries
You can print document markups as well as form field data from Acrobat viewers. The options are 
straightforward and easy to use. However, one limitation you should know about is that comment 
pop-up notes are not printed and you cannot print the content of a note. 
TIP

To see exactly what you can print when using comment notes in Acrobat, open the 
Print dialog box. The thumbnail preview in the Print dialog box shows you the types

Printing comments
To print comments you need a file that contains some comment notes. To learn more about com-
menting, see Chapter 20.

To print a file with comments and markups, follow these steps.
STEPS: Printing document markups
 
1. Open a document containing comments and markups. You can use the Text Edits 
tools, Highlight tool, and other comment tools as well as any of the Markup tools such as 
the Rectangle tool, Cloud tool, Callout tool, and others. 
 
2. Open the Print dialog box. Select File ➪ Print.
 
3. Select Document and Markups in the Comments and Forms area of the Print dialog 
box. When you make the selection for Document and Markups, the page preview in the 
Preview Composite area of the Print dialog box shows you exactly what elements print, as 
you see in Figure 31.20.
 FIGURE 31.20
Select Document and Markups from the Comments and Forms pull-down menu.
 
4. Click Print. Your print appears with the comments and markups as was shown in the 
Preview Composite in the Print dialog box.
You have another choice for printing comments. You can choose to print a document with just 
Stamp comments. From the Comments and Forms pull-down menu, select Document and Stamps. 
A preview also appears when you choose to print stamp comments. Just make the selection for 
Document and Stamps and click Print.

Printing form field data
Another option you have is printing just form field data. You can print all form field data with just 
one exception. Button faces don’t print. All the other fields including check boxes, radio buttons,

Summary
 A well-managed color workflow requires calibrating your monitor, using a proper work-
space color, and printing using a color profile designed for your printer and paper source.
 The two most common methods for managing color with desktop color printers in 
Acrobat are to enable the printer to manage the color or enable Acrobat to manage the 
color.
 When you choose to let your printer manage color, you need to use a PostScript printer 
and you turn color management on in advanced settings in your printer driver.
 When you choose to select a color profile and enable Acrobat to manage color, you turn 
color management off in your printer driver advanced settings.
 Comment markups can be printed with your document. You choose to print comment 
markups in the Acrobat Print dialog box in the Comment and Forms pull-down menu.
 You can print form field data without the background PDF design. Choose Form fields 
only in the Comment and Forms pull-down menu.
 You can create and print comment summaries in one step in the Print dialog box by 
clicking the Summarize Comments button.

A
t some time or another, the files you output to your desktop printer 
may be candidates for offset printing. The tools and commands you 
use for desktop printers, as I explained in Chapter 31, are sufficient 
for printing to all the printers you have in your office and home. However, 
when printing PDF documents on commercial printing devices, you must 
address a number of issues.
For high-end digital prepress and commercial printing, Acrobat Pro and 
Acrobat Pro Extended include all the print controls that the commercial 
printing community desires. Combined with features for previewing color, 
preflighting jobs, and printing color separations, Acrobat Pro (henceforth 
meaning both Pro and Pro Extended) ranks as a strong competitor against 
any layout or other professional applications designed to serve creative pro-
fessionals. In this chapter I cover printing from Acrobat Pro using many 
commercial printing tools.
Setting Up the Work 
Environment
In Acrobat Pro, you have a toolbar used specifically for print production. 
Open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and select Print Production. The 
Print Production toolbar opens as a floating toolbar, as shown in Figure 
32.1. Select Dock Toolbars at the bottom of the context menu.

 FIGURE 32.1
The Print Production toolbar
For printing large documents and when soft proofing files, the Loupe tool is often used. Open a 
context menu on the Select & Zoom toolbar that appears loaded in the Toolbar Well by default. 
From the context menu options click the Loupe Tool. The Loupe tool is loaded in the Select & 
Zoom toolbar.
NOTE
NOTE
Adobe Reader 9 and Acrobat Standard 9 contain both the Loupe tool and the Pan 
and Zoom tool.
Soft Proofing Color
Soft proofing color refers to viewing color on your monitor with a screen preview of the way color 
will be printed to hard copy. Soft proofing is a digital process whereby you use your computer 
monitor screen to preview things such as proper color assignments, overprints, separations, trans-
parency, and similar issues that might cause problems on printing devices, rather than print a test 
proof and consume paper and ink.
With the exception of previewing overprints, all soft proofing options are contained in the Acrobat 
Pro programs only. Most of the options you find for soft proofing apply to high-end commercial 
printing; however, some features can be useful when you’re printing to desktop color printers.
Setting up your color management environment
As discussed in Chapter 31, color management is equally important when printing to commercial 
printing devices and prepress systems. You first begin with monitor calibration and set up your 
color management preferences. Whereas your workspace color choice is best using the sRGB color 
space for most desktop printers, the Adobe RGB (1998) color workspace is a better choice for most 
commercial printing equipment.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
Most of what you need for color management in Acrobat is covered in Chapter 31.
Output Preview
 
 
Soft proofing color is handled in the Output Preview dialog box. This dialog box does not pro-
vide you options for altering the content. It is used as a viewing tool to diagnose any potential 
printing problems. From a Preview menu, you select one of three categories in which to preview 
your document — Separations, Color Warnings, or the new Acrobat 9 Object Inspector. To 

1011
Commercial Printing and Prepress
32
open the Output Preview dialog box, click the second tool (Output Preview) in the Print 
Production toolbar. The Output Preview dialog box opens.
Color Warnings
Click Color Warnings in the Output Preview dialog box. The Color Warnings pane opens, as 
shown in Figure 32.2.
Several settings in the Color Warnings pane are the same as those found in the Separations pane. 
The unique options in this pane are the Warnings items. You use this pane to preview any prob-
lems that are shown with keylines using the colors in the Warnings areas. If you need more con-
trast against the background colors, click one of the Warnings color swatches to open a color 
palette where another color can be selected to display the Warnings keyline borders.
Other areas in the Color Warnings dialog box include the following.
 FIGURE 32.2
Open the Output Preview dialog box and click Color Warnings.
Simulation Profile
Simulation Profile enables you to select from a list of ICC (International Color Consortium) pro-
files. A number of preset profiles are available from which to choose, and you can also create your 
own custom profiles and add them to the list. You create custom profiles with hardware/software 
devices that are designed specifically for calibrating monitors and creating ICC profiles. As a profile 
is created, it is saved as a file to your hard drive. Graphic designers can also often acquire custom 
profiles from print shops and service centers.
In order for Acrobat to recognize the ICC profiles you create, you must be certain that the profiles are 
stored in the proper directory. By default, utilities and commercial devices used for calibrating color 

1012
PDF Publishing
Part V
save profiles to a directory that makes them accessible to Acrobat. If you want to remove ICC pro-
files so fewer profiles show up in the Proof Colors dialog box or you have problems getting a pro-
file to the right directory, open the folder where the profiles are stored. On Windows Vista, the 
path is System32\Spool\Drivers\Color. On Macintosh OS X, look in MacintoshHD:
Library:ColorSync:Profiles. When new profiles are added to the appropriate folder on 
your computer, you can access the profiles in Acrobat after you quit the program and relaunch it if 
the profile was added while Acrobat was open.
To select a profile for color proofing, open the Simulation Profile pull-down menu and choose a 
profile to preview. Selecting the option does not change the color in the document, and you can 
select different profiles from the menu selections without permanently changing color in the file.
From the pull-down menu you’ll see a number of different profiles appear in a long list. Select the 
output device profile you want to simulate. In order to do so, you need to acquire an output pro-
file from your printer or service bureau or use a custom profile you created and added to your 
Profiles folder. For printing on an offset press on coated stock in the United States, use U.S. Web 
Coated (SWOP) v2 if your printer doesn’t have a custom profile to provide you. When you select 
one of the presets for soft proofing prints, the two check boxes for simulating ink and paper 
become accessible. (Outside the U.S. you might want to use a Japan or European option available 
in the CMYK profiles from the CMYK pull-down menu.)
TIP
TIP
To ensure your color proofing uses the same profile each time you view a file on-
screen, open a document in Acrobat. Select the profile you want to use as a default 
from the Simulation Profile pull-down menu. Quit Acrobat and relaunch the program. The last 
choice you made becomes the new default. You don’t need to quit the program to make the pro-
file choice a new default, but if the program crashes during a session, you lose preferences 
applied in that session. Quitting after making a preference choice ensures that the preference is 
held in all subsequent Acrobat sessions.
Simulate Black Ink
When the Simulate Black Ink check box is enabled, the preview shows you the dynamic range of the 
document’s profile. Dynamic range is measured in values usually between 0 and 4, although some 
scanner developers claim dynamic ranges of 4.1, 4.2, or higher. A dynamic range of something like 
3.8 yields a wide range of grays between the white point and the black point in a scanned image. If 
the dynamic range is high, you see details in shadows and highlights. If the dynamic range is low, 
highlights can get blown out and shadows lose detail. When you enable the Simulate Black Ink check 
box, look for the distinct tonal differences in the preview and detail in shadows and highlights.
Simulate Paper Color
If the check box for Simulate Paper Color is enabled in the Output Preview dialog box, the preview 
shows you a particular shade of gray as simulated for the paper color by the profile you choose. 
You may find that the preview looks too gray or has too much black. This may not be the result 
of the profile used but rather the brightness adjustment on your monitor. If your monitor is 

1013
Commercial Printing and Prepress
32
calibrated properly and the profile accurately displays the paper color, the preview should show 
you an accurate representation of the document as it is printed on paper.
Warnings
Two different warnings dynamically display potential printing problems. As you select a check 
box, you can move the Output Preview aside and preview the results in the document pane. When 
you select a box and preview the results, the display appears only when the Output Preview dialog 
box is open. Closing the dialog box returns you to the default view of the document page before 
you opened the Output Preview.
By default, the options in the Warnings section show potential problems using default colors adja-
cent to the warning item. You can change the warning colors by clicking the color swatch and 
selecting from a preset palette or selecting a custom color from your operating system color palette.
Overprints are often used to trap colors when files are intended for printing separations. Trapping 
a color creates an overlap between colors, so any movement of the paper when printed on a print-
ing press prevents printing colors without gaps between the colors. In other cases, overprints may 
be assigned to colors in illustrations intentionally when a designer wants to eliminate potential 
trapping problems. For example, you might assign an overprint to text to avoid any trapping prob-
lems where black text is printed on top of a background color. In some instances, a designer might 
unintentionally assign an overprint to a color during the creative process. As a measure of checking 
overprints for those colors that you properly assign and to review a document for potential prob-
lems, you can use Acrobat’s Show Overprinting preview to display on your monitor all the over-
prints created in a file. To view overprints in a PDF document, select the Show Overprinting check 
box in the Output Preview dialog box.
NOTE
NOTE
Acrobat 9 now has an automatic overprint preview that displays CMYK files with 
overprint previews by default. Additionally, all files saved as PDF/X also show over-
prints as a default.
To understand what happens with overprints and knockouts, look at Figure 32.3. The composite 
image is created for printing two colors. These colors are printed on separate plates for two differ-
ent inks. When the file is separated, the type is knocked out of the background, leaving holes in the 
background. Because the two colors butt up against each other, any slight movement of the paper 
creates a gap between where one ink color ends and the other begins. To prevent the problem, a 
slight bit of overprinting is added to the type. In an exaggerated view in Figure 32.3 you can see 
the stroke around the type character. The stroke is assigned an overprint so its color, which is the 
foreground color, prints on top of the background color without a knockout.
TIP
TIP
To carefully examine overprints assigned to type characters, select the Loupe tool in 
the Zoom toolbar. Move the cursor around the document to preview overprints on 
small type.

1014
PDF Publishing
Part V
 FIGURE 32.3
If an overprint is assigned to the type, the overprint area of the type color prints on top of the background 
color. If the paper moves slightly, the overprint prevents any paper color showing through gaps created by 
the misregistration.
Rich black
When files are printed with rich black, all the black in the document prints with more density. 
This is often a common setting used when printing to inkjet printers and commercial oversized 
printing devices to eliminate any muddy appearance when files contain a substantial amount of 
black. Select the box to preview how the black will lay down on the printed output. If you see too 
much density in black, be certain to avoid using rich black when printing the file.
Separations
One of the great features for soft proofing color in Acrobat Pro is the ability to preview a color sep-
aration where colors can be viewed individually or in combinations — for example, previewing 
cyan and magenta instead of previewing all colors. To preview a separation, select Separations from 
the Preview menu in the Output Preview dialog box. The pane changes to the view shown in 
Figure 32.4.
If you intend to print a file in four-color process, the Separation Preview dialog box helps you 
identify any potential problems such as spot colors that may be contained in the file, as in the file 
used when I opened the Separations preview in Figure 32.4. Likewise, if a spot-color-only job con-
tains colors not intended to be printed, they also show up.

1015
Commercial Printing and Prepress
32
 FIGURE 32.4
The Separations window shows all colors contained in a file.
You can selectively view individual colors by disabling the check boxes adjacent to each color 
name, viewing selected colors only, and viewing spot colors converted to CMYK. When you click 
the X in a check box for a color, all images and objects containing a percentage of that color are 
hidden. Click again and the color is displayed.
You evaluate color values by moving the cursor around the document with the Output Preview 
dialog box open. Notice the percentage values on the far right side of Figure 32.4. These values 
represent the percent of ink at the cursor position.
Object Inspector

NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
Perhaps one of the most dramatic changes in print production in Acrobat 9 is 
related to the Convert Colors options. You have an impressive set of controls that 
enable you to selectively convert and/or preserve colors according to object type. Radical 
changes have been made to the convert color settings shown in Figure 32.6 as compared to all 
earlier releases of Acrobat.

list. Select the item and you can choose the object type from the Object Type pull-down 
menu (see Object Type in this list) and the color type from the Color Type pull-down menu 
(See Color Type in this list). You can add another conversion command by clicking the Add 
button and define settings for a different object type. Under the Conversion attributes you 
can choose to preserve or convert color. The Move Up and Move Down buttons enable you 
to choose what commands are executed first.
 Save/Load buttons. You can define a series of commands and color conversion options 
and save the settings to a file. Click the Load button and you can load settings you create 
by clicking the Save button.
 Matching Criteria. You have choices for setting attributes according to Object Type and 
Color Type.
 Object Type. There are four choices from the pull-down menu commands. Choose 
Any Object to apply the conversion settings to all objects. Choose Image, Text, or Line 
Art to apply conversions to one of these object types. Smooth Shade is the final choice, 
which enables you to apply conversions to gradients. Notice in Figure 32.6 I have 
three different object types with different conversion settings for each type.

 Color Type. From the Color Type pull-down menu you choose the colorspace for the 
object in question. You might choose Any RGB to convert RGB color to CMYK color. 
The choice you make here is the existing color of the object. You make a choice for 
the conversion target color in another menu.
 Minimum Text Size. Choose from preset point sizes or type a value in the text box. 
(Values range from 1 to 1 million). Conversion is applied to the minimum size defined in 
this menu. Sizes below the minimum are ignored.
 Maximum Text Size. Essentially this setting is the opposite of Minimum Text Size. 
Define a size for the maximum point size for text.
 Convert Command. From the pull-down menu choose Preserve, Convert to Profile, or 
Decalibrate. The Preserve choice preserves the color. Convert to Profile converts the color 
from the Color Type setting to the selected destination Profile. Decalibrate removes pro-
files from the identified object in the Object Type menu.
 Conversion Profile. Choose a profile from this menu for the destination of the conversion.
 Rendering Intent. Choose from Use Document Intent, Relative Colormetric, Absolute 
Colormetric, Perceptual, or Saturation. For more information on Rendering Intents, 
check out the Acrobat Help file.
 Output Intent. Check the check box for Convert to Output Intent and choose a profile 
from the Profile pull-down menu for the Output Intent if you want to convert all objects 
to a single output intent.
 Convert Options. Check the boxes for handling black and CMYK primary colors in the 
output.
 Convert Pages. Choose All or a page range for the pages to be converted.

apply to the options aren’t saved with the PDF file. If you convert spot colors to CMYK, for exam-
ple, and save the document, the colors are unaffected when you reopen the file. The changes 
applied in the Ink Manager take effect only when you print a PDF document. To open the Ink

You change density values and the trapping sequence by editing the field box. To alias spot colors, 
select a spot color and map the color to the same angle and density as a process color. One of the 
great settings in this dialog box is the check box for Converting All Spots to Process. If you have 
one or more colors defined as spot colors, you can convert the spot color to process color by 
checking the box and clicking OK. Another advantage you have with the Ink Manager is when you 
need to remap one spot color value to another. If you have two colors that are supposed to be 
printed with the same spot values (such as Pantone 185 CVC and Pantone 185 CV), you can map 
the color so both color names are printed on the same plate.
TIP
TIP
You can interact with the Ink Manager directly from the Advanced Print Setup dia-
log box. If printing color separations from Acrobat, you can verify colors at the final 
stage of printing to be certain your colors are converted, remapped, or preserved by clicking the 
Ink Manager button in the Advanced Print Setup dialog box.
Transparency Flattener Preview
 
 Transparency creates problems when printing to various PostScript devices because the PostScript 
RIPs don’t support transparency. For resolving printing problems with transparency, you need to 

1020
PDF Publishing
Part V
flatten the transparency, which results in files that print successfully on any kind of PostScript 
device. When transparency is flattened in a file the transparent vector objects are converted to non-
transparent objects or raster images. Through this conversion, the colors meld together to form a 
simulated view of transparency. The amount of blending that transparent colors need depends on 
the amount of transparency you apply to the objects. As you move the Raster/Vector Balance slider 
to the left to flatten transparency, all vector objects are rasterized. When you move the slider to the 
right, the transparency flattener maintains as many vector objects as needed in order to success-
fully print the file.
You can flatten transparency in degrees, and objects in a document are affected according to the 
degree of transparency flattening you apply. Determining how the other objects are affected is the 
purpose of the transparency flattener in Acrobat.
When you use the Transparency Flattening tool in the Print Production toolbar, the transparency 
changes that you make to the PDF are preserved when you save the file. To open the Flattener 
Preview dialog box, click the Flattener Preview tool in the Print Production toolbar; the options 
appear as shown in Figure 32.8.
 FIGURE 32.8

Previews are displayed only for PostScript printing devices. Be certain you have a PostScript printer 
selected in your Print Setup dialog box before previewing transparency. Beginning with the 
Highlight pull-down menu you have options for the following:
 Refresh/Highlight. Click Refresh when you make attribute changes to see a preview of 
the results. The Highlight pull-down menu offers selections for areas in the PDF file you 
can preview.
 Transparency Flattener Presets. Select a preset from the pull-down menu. Your options 
are Low, Medium, and High Resolution. You can reset the preset, save a preset that is 
added to the menu, and delete a preset after you saved one to the menu.
 Raster/Vector Balance. Move the slider left to add more transparency flattening. Click 
the Refresh button each time you make readjustment of the amount of flattening to see a 
preview of the results.
 Line Art and Text Resolution. Use the text box to edit resolution for line art.
 Gradient and Mesh resolution. Change values in the field box to edit the resolution you 
want to apply to gradients and gradient meshes.
 Convert All Text to Outlines. If you intend to convert text to outlines, you can see a pre-
view for how text objects are affected in complex regions. When printing a file, you’ll want 
to avoid globally converting text to outlines because the files are more difficult to print, and 
small text on output devices that print at lower resolutions may appear unsatisfactory.
 Convert All Strokes to Outlines. Converts all strokes to outlines. Just as is the case 
with text converted to outlines, the files will take longer to print if you convert strokes 
to outlines.
 Clip Complex Regions. The boundaries between vector objects and raster objects 
change as you move the slider. Some objects remain in vector form according to the 
degree of rasterization you apply. This option ensures the boundaries between the vector 
and raster objects fall within clipping paths, preventing artifacts appearing outside the 
path boundaries. As with any illustration artwork, the more clipping paths used in a file, 
the more difficult the printing.
 Preserve Overprint. Preserves all overprints assigned in the document.
 Color Space. Click the Change button to change the transparency blending space to a 
profile you can choose from the Color Space drop-down menu in the Change Page-Level 
Transparency Blending Space dialog box.
 Page Range. Apply the settings to all pages or select a page range.
 Apply to PDF. After making your choices from the various options, click the Apply but-
ton. You can save the PDF document and all the transparency flattening is saved with the 
document.

Trapping Files
You can trap PDF files for commercial printing by applying trap presets from a selection installed 
as defaults or from custom trap presets you create in Acrobat. The Trap Presets dialog box provides 
you options for creating custom trap presets, editing a custom preset, assigning presets, and delet-
ing custom presets. Although Acrobat provides you with trapping options, creative professionals 
should leave the trapping of your files to professional technicians at imaging centers. Unless you 
completely understand trapping, you can run into trouble by manually trapping your files. 
Imaging centers either use expensive custom trapping software or In-RIP trapping — both of 
which are much preferred over what Acrobat provides you with the trapping options.
TIP
TIP
If you have a file that uses Overprinting but not transparency, and you want to 
ensure that it always prints correctly regardless of the whether the output device is 
overprint aware, you can flatten the overprinting via the transparency flattener. Just make sure 
Preserve Overprints is off.
Fixing hairlines
 
 
You may need to fix hairline rules. Click the Fix Hairlines tool in the Print Production toolbar to 
open the Fix Hairlines dialog box. You can thicken up any line that falls below a specified value to 
a new value you supply in a field box.
To fix hairlines, click the Fix Hairlines tool in the Print Production toolbar. The Fix Hairlines 
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 32.9. In this dialog box, you specify the amounts for hair-
line fixes.

The first dialog box that opens enables you to select an existing preset or create a new one. Click 
the Create button to open the New Trap Preset dialog box as shown in Figure 32.11. In order to 
make adjustments in the dialog box you should be familiar with trapping and the acceptable 
amounts to apply for trap widths, miter adjustments, and attributes assigned to images and thresh-
olds. If you know how to trap a file, you’ll know what settings to apply. If you don’t know any-
thing about trapping, it’s best to leave the job to your commercial printer.

Cropping Pages
Two tools appear in the Print Production toolbar for cropping pages in Acrobat. Ideally, you’ll 
want to export to PDF from an authoring program with crop marks at the time you convert to 
PDF. Acrobat won’t retain any bleeds in your document. If you don’t have bleeds, these tools can 
help you set up the proper page size and add crop marks. A document such as a Microsoft Word 
file that needs to go to press is an ideal candidate for these tools because you won’t find bleeds in 
Word files.
Adding printer marks
 
 
When cropping pages, you’ll typically add crop and other printer’s marks to the cropped page so 
you’ll know the correct trim size.

For a description on using the Add Printer Marks tool, see Chapter 8.
Cropping pages
 
 When cropping pages, the thing to remember is to first use the Add Printer Marks tool, and then 
use the Crop Pages tool in the Print Production toolbar. When you click the Crop Pages tool, the 
Crop Pages dialog box opens where you set the page size, select the range of pages you want to 
crop, and view a preview before you exit the dialog box.
After adding crop marks, click OK; the printer marks appear on the page. The process for adding 
printer marks and using the Crop Pages dialog box is covered in Chapter 8.
PDF Optimizer
PDF Optimizer is a menu command available under the Advanced menu. You can choose 
Advanced ➪ PDF Optimizer or open the Print Production toolbar and click the PDF Optimizer

Working with Job Definition Files
You use a Job Definition File (JDF) in production workflows to include information necessary for a 
production process and information related to the PDF creation.
 
 You assign the information in a JDF file through a collection of dialog boxes that begins with 
your clicking on the JDF Job Definitions tool at the far right side of the Print Production toolbar. 
Clicking the tool opens the JDF Job Definitions dialog box, as shown in Figure 32.12.
 FIGURE 32.12
Click the JDF Job Definitions tool to open the JDF Job Definitions dialog box.
Click the New button to open the Create New Job Definition dialog box. You make choices for creat-
ing a new definition, using the open document’s structure, or applying a definition from another file 
saved to your hard drive. If you create a new definition, you need to supply a name in the Name field 
box and click OK; the Edit JDF Job Definition dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 32.13.
In the default General tab you can define some production information and binding settings, pre-
flight information, PDF conversion settings, and Job ID information. Click the Customer Info tab 
to add contact and identifying information.
The entire process for creating and using JDF files is extensive and beyond the scope of this chap-
ter. For more information about JDF, see the Help document installed with Acrobat.

Preflighting PDF Files
Preflighting is a term creative professionals and service technicians use to refer to analyzing a file for 
suitability for printing. A preflight assessment might examine a file for the proper color mode of 
images, whether images are compressed, whether fonts are either embedded or accessible to the 
operating system, or any number of other conditions that might interfere with successfully printing 
a job.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
The Preflight features have had quite a bit of overhaul in Acrobat 9. In addition to 
similar options you had with earlier Acrobat viewers for preflighting files, Preflight 
now offers some impressive new features such as the ability to create new Adobe PDF layers, 
additional presets for online publishing, and more PDF standards support.

I saved mentioning the Preflight tool in the Print Production toolbar to last because preflighting 
PDF files is a bit complicated and quite complex. In addition to clicking the Preflight tool, you can 
also open the Preflight dialog box by selecting Advanced ➪ Preflight or pressing Shift+Ctrl/Ô+X. 
Any one of these actions opens the Preflight dialog box shown in Figure 32.14.
 FIGURE 32.14
Click the Preflight tool in the Print Production toolbar or select Advanced ➪ Preflight to open the Preflight 
dialog box.
The tools used to preflight files might be stand-alone applications or features built into programs 
used for printing to commercial printing equipment. Prior to Acrobat 6 you needed to preflight a 
file before converting to PDF with a stand-alone product that analyzed the original authoring 
application file prior to conversion to PDF, or a third-party plug-in for Acrobat that performed pre-
flighting on PDF files. Preflighting PDFs from within Acrobat was introduced in Acrobat 6 and has 
been polished and greatly improved in Acrobat 9.
As a matter of fact, there’s so much to Preflight and the various options you can use, covering all 
features would take about half the size of this book to thoroughly explain all features. I cover some 
of the more important and impressive features here in this chapter. For more information on 
Preflighting files and complete coverage of all the options available to you, consult the complete 
Acrobat Help file.
Preflighting a file
Acrobat requires you to have a file open in the document pane in order to run a preflight check 
unless you use a batch sequence or droplet. To preflight a document, be certain a file is open and

click the Preflight tool in the Print Production toolbar. The Preflight dialog box shown previously 
in Figure 32.14 opens. In the scrollable and resizable window, you see a number of preinstalled 
profiles listed with a description for the kind of preflighting each profile performs. Use the scroll 
bar on the right side of the window to display additional profiles, and open & close the various 
disclosure triangles. If the number of items gets too many, try using the Show & search/filter 
options.
The Options menu contains a number of menu choices for editing profiles, importing and export-
ing profiles, and creating profile reports.
If a profile exists containing the conditions you want to check, select a profile and click the 
Analyze button. After analyzing a file, a summary report appears in the Results tab in the Preflight 
window as shown in Figure 32.15. Any errors in the file are reported in the summary. The sum-
mary report is listed in a hierarchy with subnotations listed under parent categories. Click the icon 
to the left of each category to expand the list.
 FIGURE 32.15
After analyzing a file a summary report is shown in the Results tab in the Preflight window.
If you see errors reported after preflighting a file, you need to fix the problems either in Acrobat 
using Preflight’s FixUps, the Print Production tools or back in the original authoring program, and 
recreate the PDF file.

Creating a new profile
If none of the preset profiles do the job of file checking for your workflow, you can create your 
own custom profiles. Acrobat offers you more than 400 different conditions that you can use in 
preflighting files. Click the Options down-pointing arrow in the Preflight window and you’ll find a 
list of commands that relate to creating and editing profiles, as well as other commands for exam-
ining the internal structure of a PDF document as shown in Figure 32.16.
 FIGURE 32.16
Open the Options menu and you find all the commands you need for creating, editing, and modifying 
profiles.
To create a new profile, choose Options ➪ Create New Profile. The Preflight: Edit Profile dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 32.17.
Along the left side of the dialog box you find the list of installed profiles. These profiles are listed in 
hierarchical order. To expand a category, click the Plus (+) symbol. To the top right of the list you 
find a pull-down menu. The default choice when creating a new profile is Unlocked as shown in 
Figure 32.17. If you attempt to edit an existing profile, the profile will be locked and you’ll need to 
open the menu and choose Unlocked before you can make any edits.

 FIGURE 32.17
Choose Options ➪ Create New Profile to open the Preflight: Edit Profiles dialog box.
The Name text box is where you add a name for your profile. Below the Name text box you find 
the Purpose text box where a description can be added to define the profile’s purpose. Following the 
Purpose description you find an Author field, Email field, and a menu for targeting a group location 
for saving the file. At the bottom of the list, several tools appear for creating and managing profiles.
 
 
  From left to right, the tools are as follows:
 Create a new profile. Click the icon to create a new profile. This tool might be used 
when reviewing another profile. When you open the Create New Profile menu command 
and arrive at the dialog box shown in Figure 32.17, clicking this tool does nothing. If you 
are on another pane and click the tool, the Preflight: Edit Profile dialog box opens as 
shown in Figure 32.17.
 Duplicate the selected profile. Click the icon to duplicate a selected profile. Once it’s 
duplicated, you can edit the profile to change conditions.
 Delete the selected profile. Select a profile and click the icon to remove the profile from 
the list window. You cannot delete the profile if Locked is selected in the Preflight: Edit 
Profile pane.
 Import. Click the Import tool to import a profile created by a vendor or a user in your 
workgroup.
 Export. If you are responsible for creating profiles at a service center or in a company 
where you want to implement a set of standards, click the Export button. The profile 
selected when you click this button is exported to a file that you can send to other users 
who in turn import the profile.

To create a new custom profile, you should be at the screen shown in Figure 32.17 — that is, you 
should have chosen Options ➪ Create New Profile. Type a name in the Name text box. From here, 
it’s a matter of selecting items in the list on the left side of the dialog box and editing the changes 
appearing in the right pane. For example, I started a new profile by clicking Document in the left 
pane. I then opened the pull-down menu for the first choice and chose an icon to present a flag for 
the summary report. Below the icon choice (the X you see in Figure 32.18) I chose Acrobat 5 com-
patibility. My next choice was an icon for encryption followed by a choice for flagging the report 
when a PDF document is damaged. These choices are clearly shown in Figure 32.18.
 FIGURE 32.18
Click an item in the left pane and the right pane changes to reflect options choices you can make for the 
selected item.
The rest of your new profile creation follows the same steps. You find the categories in the left 
pane, select a given category, and choose from menu items the options you want to include in the 
profile for preflighting the document.
After you create a new custom profile, click the Save button to save the new profile to your list of 
profiles.
Creating reports and comments
After you create a profile, open a PDF document and open the Preflight dialog box. Choose the 
profile from the list and click the Analyze button as I described earlier in the section “Preflighting a 
file.” A summary report then appears directly in the Preflight dialog box. This summary is an initial 
description of any errors found or a list of checked items and a statement confirming the file meets 
the conditions specified by the profile.

For a more informative document, you can create a report that lists the text summary and highlights on 
all pages in the document where errors are found. Click the Create Report button in the Preflight dialog 
box after analyzing a document to create a new PDF file as a report summary. When you open the PDF, 
you’ll see the first page listing the summarized comments for errors found, and on each subsequent 
page you’ll find highlights marking each area where an error was found as shown in Figure 32.19.
 FIGURE 32.19
Each page contains highlights of any errors found after preflighting a document and creating a summary

Creating droplets
A great new feature added in Acrobat 8 was the preflight droplets. A droplet is an executable file 
created from the Preflight options where you can drag and drop PDF documents to preflight them. 
To create a droplet, follow these steps.
STEPS: Creating a droplet
 
1. Open the Preflight dialog box. If you don’t have a PDF document open in the docu-
ment pane, you can open the Preflight dialog box by choosing Advanced ➪ Preflight. You 
can also use the same command when a document is open.

2. Set up the droplet. Choose the profile you created or select an existing profile and 
choose Options ➪ Create Profile Droplet. The Preflight: Droplet Setup dialog box opens 
as shown in Figure 32.20.
 
 In the Preflight: Droplet Setup dialog box make choices for the location where you want 
the successful files saved, the files with errors saved, and the reports you want to create. 
You can toggle through this dialog box and get a good idea for how to identify locations 
and make choices for reports.
 FIGURE 32.20
Make choices for saved file locations and report settings in the Preflight: Droplet Setup 
dialog box.
 
3. Save the settings. Click the Save button to open the Save droplet as dialog box. Locate a 
target folder and supply a name for your file. Click Save to save the droplet.
 
4. Run a preflight. Open the folder where you saved the preflight droplet and drag a PDF 
document or multiple PDF documents on top of the droplet icon. A Preflight dialog box 
opens and a progress bar shows the preflight progress.
 
5. Examine the report. After the preflight progress has completed, a preflight summary 
report opens as a PDF Portfolio. In my example I dropped four files on my preflight 
droplet. The files are shown in the PDF Portfolio interface in Figure 32.21. From here 
you can double-click a file to view the summary report.

Examining PDF structure
Another option you have available with the Preflight tool is examining PDF structure. You have a 
few choices in the Options menu in the Preflight dialog box. Open a file and open the Preflight 
dialog box (Advanced ➪ Preflight). From the Options menu, choose Browse Internal Structure of 
all Document Fonts. The Preflight: Browse Internal Structure of all Document Fonts dialog box 
opens as shown in Figure 32.22.
The report shows all document fonts and a detail of the font attributes. You can check this report 
for font embedding, subsetting, name, family, and a host of related font information.
Close the dialog box to return to the Preflight dialog box. Open the Options menu again and 
choose Browse Internal PDF Structure. A report is shown in the Preflight: Browse Internal PDF 
Structure dialog box as shown in Figure 32.23.

Checking and Fixing Up Files
One of the great new additions to Acrobat 9 is the work that’s gone into checking files and fixing 
them up. You can use profiles you create for your own use and you can use profiles sent to you by 
service centers. But the tools you have available in Acrobat offer you an abundance of opportunity 
to analyze and repair files for various output sources.
In the Preflight dialog box you find settings under the Digital Printing and online publishing area. 
You also have PDF/X options in the Preflight dialog box to make PDF files compliant with PDF/X 
standards. For digital printing checks and fix-ups, look at Figure 32.25. Click this item and at the 
bottom of the Preflight dialog box and click the Analyze and Fix button.
 FIGURE 32.25
For analyzing and fixing files to be printed on digital printing devices make the choice in the Preflight dia-
log box and click Analyze and Fix.
Acrobat opens another window in the Preflight dialog box that shows a progress bar as items are ana-
lyzed and it makes its best effort to fix the problems. Wait until the progress bar, shown in Figure 
32.26, has finished before proceeding. As items are analyzed they are listed in the dialog box.
When Acrobat completes the analysis a report appears in the Preflight dialog box as shown in 
Figure 32.27. Items essential to printing the file that cannot be fixed need to be addressed back in 
the original authoring program. For non-essential errors and a complete fix of issues that might 
impair printing, Acrobat can make many files print ready.
Printing PDFs for Commercial Printing
Acrobat Pro contains all the print controls you need for printing files to commercial devices. To 
access the options, choose File ➪ Print or click the Print tool in the Toolbar Well. In the Print dia-
log box, click the Advanced button.
When you select Advanced in the Print dialog box in Acrobat Pro, the Advanced Print Setup 
dialog box shown in Figure 32.28 opens. There are four categories in the left pane. When you 
select a category, the right pane changes, just as the Preferences dialog box changes when 
you select a category.
NOTE

Output
Output options enable you to set the color and frequency controls for the output. At the top of the 
dialog box a check box is available for printing the document as an image. For desktop printing 
when you have trouble printing the file, you can use the Print As Image option as a last resort. 
Print As Image rasterizes the PDF document, and type usually looks poor on the final output. 
Don’t enable the check box for professional printing. This option is also available in the Advanced 
Print options for Adobe Reader and Acrobat Standard. The remaining items are used for commer-
cial printing and they include the following:
 Color. Select from composite or separations. Users with PostScript 3 RIPs can choose 
either Separations or In-Rip Separations depending on how you set up your RIP defaults. 
For creative professionals printing separation proofs to desktop printers, select 
Separations. For composite color, select Composite from the pull-down menu. For print-
ing RC Paper or composite images to film, select Composite Gray.
NOTE
NOTE
If Separations is not available, you don’t have a PostScript printer capable of print-
ing separations selected for your printer. If you don’t see separations active, cancel 
out of the dialog box, select the Adobe PDF printer in the Print dialog box, and then click 
Advanced to return to the Advanced Print Settings.

 Color Profile. Select from the pull-down menu items the color profile used in your 
workflow.
 Flip. For emulsion control, select horizontal from the Flip pull-down menu to print with 
emulsion down. You have options for flip vertical and flip vertical & horizontal.
NOTE
NOTE
Adobe’s print controls in Acrobat Pro are almost perfect. However, one limitation 
still exists in Acrobat 9. There is no emulsion control for composite printing. 
Emulsion control is available only when printing separations. Therefore, service centers needing 
to print emulsion-down composites on LexJet, mylar, transwhite, and other substrates on large-
format inkjet printers need to flip files prior to PDF creation or by using the rotation tools in 
Acrobat.
 Screening. If you’re using the Adobe PDF printer as the printer driver, the screening 
options won’t match the device where you print your job. If you’re using a device printer, 
the screening options for the device are derived from the PPD (PostScript Printer 
Description). If the frequency is not available from the pull-down menu, you select cus-
tom screens and angles from the Ink Manager (discussed later in this list).
 Trapping. If trapping is assigned to the document, you can turn trapping on and load a 
trap preset.
 Transparency Flattener Preset. Default and custom presets appear in the pull-down 
menu. Select a preset if you want to flatten transparency at print time.
 Simulate Overprinting. This option, also available for composite, prints only the print 
results in a proof, showing the results of overprints assigned in the document. This fea-
ture emulates the overprinting previews of high-end color proofers, such as what was 
introduced with the Imation Rainbow printer.
 Use Maximum Available JPEG2000 Image Resolution. When the check box is 
enabled, the maximum usable resolution contained in JPEG2000 images is used.
 Frequency/Angle. To edit the frequency and angle for each plate, type the desired values 
in the text boxes. Click each color and edit the Frequency and Angle text boxes.
 Ink Manager. Click the Ink Manager button and the Ink Manager dialog box opens, 
providing options the same as those available when you click the Ink Manager tool in 
the Print Production toolbar. If spot colors are contained in the file, you can convert 
spot or RGB to CMYK color by selecting the Convert All Spots to Process check box. 
The spot color converts to CMYK when you check the box. (See “Ink Manager” earlier 
in this chapter).
Marks and Bleeds
Select Marks and Bleeds in the left pane of the Advanced Print Setup dialog box, and the right pane 
changes to show options for adding printer’s marks. All marks added in the Advanced Print Setup 
dialog box apply only to the printed file. If you want to save a file with printer’s marks, use the

Select All to show all printer’s marks. If you want individual marks, clear All Marks and select the 
check boxes individually below the Marks Style pull-down menu. From the pull-down menu 
options, you can choose Western Style or Eastern Style. Use Eastern Style for printing files in far-
eastern countries.
Marks and bleeds are also available for composite proofs as well as separations.
PostScript Options
Click PostScript Options in the Advanced Print Setup dialog box, and the right pane changes to 
display options for PostScript attributes as shown in Figure 32.29.
 FIGURE 32.29
Click PostScript and the right pane changes to reflect options for PostScript output options.
The options include the following:
 Font and Resource Policy. Three options are available from the pull-down menu. Select 
Send at Start to send all fonts to the printer as the print job starts. Select Send by Range 
to send fonts as they are encountered on the pages as new pages print; the fonts stay in 
memory until the job finishes printing. Select Send for Each page to conserve memory; 
the fonts are flushed after each page prints. The last selection takes more time to print but 
can overcome problems when you are experiencing difficulty in printing a job.

 Print Method. Choose from PostScript Level 2 or PostScript 3 depending on the level of 
PostScript used by the RIP.
 Download Asian Fonts. Check the box if Asian characters are in the document and not 
available at the RIP.
 Convert TrueType to Type 1. Converts TrueType to Type 1 fonts.
 Emit CIDFontType2 as CIDFontType2 (PS version 2015 and greater). Converts 
TrueType fonts to PostScript font equivalents.
 Emit Undercolor Removal/Black Generation. GCR/UCR removal is necessary only if 
the original file contained embedded settings. Clear the box to remove any embedded set-
tings that might have been inadvertently added and saved in Photoshop. If you want to 
apply any embedded settings, selecting the box to Emit the settings applies them as if 
they were embedded in the authoring program.
 Emit Halftones. In the event that the PostScript file contained embedded halftones, you 
can preserve them here, and the frequency assigned in the Output options is used to 
print the file. Select the box to apply the frequency embedded in a file. You want to pre-
serve halftones when you want an embedded halftone frequency in an image to print at a 
different frequency than the rest of the job.
 Emit Transfer Functions. Clear the box to eliminate any transfer functions that might 
have been embedded in Photoshop images. If you know you want images to print with 
embedded transfer functions you may have applied according to instructions provided 
from a publication house, select the box to preserve the transfer functions.
 Emit Flatness. If flatness was exported from files created in Adobe Photoshop with clip-
ping paths, or if a vector art image has flatness applied, the flatness values are retained in 
the output.
 Emit PS Form Objects. PostScript XObject stores common information in a document, 
such as backgrounds, headers, footers, and so on. When PostScript XObjects are used, 
the printing is faster, but it requires more memory. To speed up the printing, select the 
box to emit PostScript XObjects.

To understand more about XObjects, see Chapter 10.
 Discolored background correction. Corrects any problems with discoloring on back-
grounds.
 Always use host collation. If collating is assigned in the Print dialog box, checking this 
box collates pages according to the settings used for the print engine.

You can capture and save the settings you select in the Advanced Print Setup dialog box as a print-
ing profile. Click the Save As button to open the Save Print Settings dialog box. Provide a name 
and click OK. You select the profiles from the pull-down menu for Settings in the top left corner of 
the Advanced Print Setup dialog box.
If you create a setting and want to later delete it from the Settings pull-down menu, select the set-
ting to delete and press the Delete button.
Summary
 You can change page sizes with the Crop Pages tool. You add trim marks with the Add 
Printer Marks tool in the Print Production toolbar in Acrobat Pro.
 Both Acrobat Pro products provide several tools for soft proofing color, overprints, sepa-
ration previews, and transparency flattening. Acrobat Standard and Adobe Reader do not 
support tools used for commercial printing.
 Traps are defined with the Trap Presets tool in Acrobat Pro.
 JDF (Job Definition Files) are defined using the JDF Job Definitions tool in Acrobat Pro.
 Preflighting files is a manner of checking a document for potential errors in printing. 
Acrobat Pro offers you an extended set of conditions to check files before sending them 
to prepress centers and print shops.
 You save PDF/X-compliant files from the Preflight dialog box. Sending PDF/X files to ser-
vice centers and print shops optimizes your chances for successful output when printing 
to commercial printing devices.
 A set of preset profiles is installed with Acrobat Pro for preflighting jobs. You can create 
custom profiles by adding preset conditions in the Preflight dialog box.
 You can import and export profiles. You can acquire profiles from service centers and 
add them to your profile list for preflighting files.
 Acrobat provides several preflight options for examining PDF structure and content. Use 
the Options menu in the Preflight dialog box and choose the Browse Internal Structure 
and Create Inventory commands.
 Preflight droplets are executable files you create to preflight one or more PDF documents. 
The result is a PDF Portfolio containing a summary report of all files preflighted via a 
drag-and-drop function.
 The Advanced Print Setup dialog box in Acrobat Pro offers you options for color separa-
tions, printer’s marks, frequency control, emulsion control, and other print attributes 
associated with commercial printing.


P
art VI is all about forms. In Chapter 33 we first take a 
look at Adobe LiveCycle Designer (Windows only) for 
creating dynamic forms. More than 70 pages comprise 
this chapter that provides you a foundation and start for using 
LiveCycle Designer. In Chapter 34 we switch gears and look at 
creating Acrobat PDF forms using Acrobat Standard (Windows), 
Acrobat Professional (Windows and Macintosh), and Acrobat 
Professional Extended (Windows). You’ll discover the new Form 
Edit mode in Acrobat 9 and learn how to quickly create fillable 
forms using any one of the commercial Acrobat products.
In Chapter 35 we look at managing form data through new features 
in Acrobat 9 for sharing data on Acrobat.com and tracking returned 
forms. To learn more about using Acrobat JavaScript for adding 
interactive and dynamic features to PDF forms, see Chapter 36 on 
the CD-ROM.

W
hen it comes to Acrobat and forms, essentially two different types 
of forms can be created with tools from your Acrobat Pro or 
Acrobat Pro Extended installation in Windows only. Acrobat Pro 
lets you create Adobe PDF forms within Acrobat on either Windows or 
Macintosh. In Windows, you have another tool installed with Acrobat Pro 
called Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES that is a separate executable application. 
Forms created in Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (or simply Designer, or 
LiveCycle Designer as I refer to it in this chapter) are an XML Forms 
Architecture (XML), which is an application of XML for electronic forms.
What’s important to remember is that PDF forms created in Acrobat are very 
different than XML forms created in LiveCycle Designer. Among other 
things, you can’t edit XML forms in Acrobat, and there are some limitations 
to what you can do with Acrobat PDF forms you edit in Designer.
As a forms development tool, LiveCycle Designer is one of the best applica-
tions you can find to create forms that can be filled out and submitted using 
any Acrobat viewer. However, Designer is not a panacea for all forms devel-
opment. You do have many opportunities for impressive forms creation in 
Acrobat, as I explain in the remaining chapters of this book.
For now, we’re concerned with Designer and how to use the application to 
create XML forms. As I stated at the beginning of this book, the Adobe 
Acrobat 9 PDF Bible is not a book on forms and not a book on LiveCycle 
Designer. There’s much more to Designer than can be covered in this book. 
As a matter of fact, there’s so much to creating PDF forms in Acrobat and 
LiveCycle Designer that I’ve written a comprehensive work — PDF Forms 
Using Acrobat and LiveCycle Designer Bible (Wiley Publishing 2009).

What I can hope to do in this chapter is provide a brief introduction to Adobe LiveCycle Designer 
and talk about some of the neat things you can do with the program. For a much more thorough 
description of the tools, commands, and features, be certain to look over the Help document pro-
vided with your Acrobat installation, and look for another source to help you learn more about 
creating dynamic XML forms using LiveCycle Designer.
Setting Up the Work Environment
Adobe LiveCycle Designer is a standalone program used to design XML forms. When you create 
forms in Designer, you cannot edit the form fields in Acrobat. Therefore, the work environment in 
Acrobat does not require any special tools to edit forms created in Designer. To view and fill out 
forms in Acrobat use the default toolbar setup. Open a context menu on the Toolbar Well and 
select Reset Toolbars.
In the LiveCycle Designer workplace are a number of different options for setting up your work 
environment. Designer makes extensive use of palettes with fewer tools, as in Acrobat; so setting 
up your workplace is primarily a matter of opening and closing palettes. In Figure 33.1 you can 
see a number of palettes loaded in palette wells for an editing session.

Running LiveCycle Designer on a Macintosh
If you’re a Macintosh user, you may feel left out when it comes to forms development using 
Acrobat. You do have all the tools you need to create PDF forms in Acrobat, as I explain in Chapter 
34. However, you don’t have a Mac version of LiveCycle Designer shipped with your Mac Acrobat 
software.
There is one solution available to you if you want to use your Mac and you want to create forms 
with LiveCycle Designer. All you need is an application that permits you to install Windows on an 
Intel Mac. You can use Apple’s Boot Camp (www.apple.com), Parallels Desktop for Mac (www.
parallels.com), or VMware’s Fusion (www.vmware.com).
Once you install one of the three virtual desktop applications, you then need to install Windows 
(XP or Vista). After you have the Windows operating system installed, you need to install Acrobat 
Pro or Acrobat Pro Extended — Windows version.
I’ve found VMware’s Fusion software, shown in Figure 33.2, to work exceptionally well on a 
Macintosh. I can exchange files between OS X Leopard and Windows Vista. LiveCycle Designer 
works just the same on Windows for an Intel Mac as you find on a dedicated Windows machine.
 FIGURE 33.2

Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
This solution requires Mac users to spend a little more money for a virtual desktop application, 
Acrobat Pro or Pro Extended for Windows, and the Windows operating system. However, if your 
work is primarily devoted to creating forms, you’ll find the little expense you need to make to 
install LiveCycle Designer well worth it when you need to create dynamic forms.
Preparing the workspace
Unlike Acrobat in which you engage in very different editing tasks, Designer is all about creating 
forms. There are some palettes that you won’t use in an editing session and others that may be 
used in some layouts. For example, you might use the Data Connection tools when you want to 
make a connection to a database file. When designing other forms you might not use the tools. In 
some forms you may add barcodes, while in other forms you won’t need the barcode tools. This is 
the case for several palettes in Designer.
Regardless of what kind of form you create there are some common palettes needed in almost all 
form designs, and you’ll want to set up your work environment with the essential tools first. These 
palettes are as follows:
 Object. The Object palette contains three tabs. The Field tab provides options for assign-
ing appearance attributes to fields. The Value tab contains options for assigning attributes 
to field values. Among other attributes, the Value tab lets you change field types — 
something you can’t do in Acrobat. The Binding tab lets you set up data connections to 
bind fields to a database.
 Layout. The Layout tab provides a number of attribute choices for field layouts such as 
size, margins, captions, and so on.
 Border. The Border tab provides extensive choices for creating field appearances. Acrobat 
offers a few choices for borders and fills. In Designer, you can format field appearances 
similar to the way you can format cells in a program such as Microsoft Excel.
 Font/Paragraph. By default, the Font and Paragraph tabs don’t appear in the Designer 
workspace. If you want to change fonts and set font and paragraph attributes, select 
Window ➪ Font and both tabs open. Keep this palette open when designing a form. 
You’ll use it often.
 Object Library. The Object Library is your repository containing the fields you add to a 
Designer form. In Acrobat, you choose a tool in Form Edit mode from the Add New Field 
pull-down menu. Acrobat supports eight different field types. Designer supports 25 dif-
ferent field types/objects in the Object Library Standard tab alone that you drag from the 
palette tab to the document page. Among other tabs in the Object Library palette you also 
have an option for adding your own custom designed fields that can be reused on many 
different forms.
 How To. Designer’s How To tab is where help information is quickly accessible. When 
you first start using Designer, it’s a good idea to keep this palette open. After you know 
your way around the Designer workspace, you can close the palette to make more room 
for other palettes.

1051
Using Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (Windows Only)
33
 Hierarchy. On the left side of the Designer workspace, you see the Hierarchy palette. 
Keep this palette open for all your forms designs. The palette lists all the fields, subforms, 
master pages, and structure on your design in a hierarchical order. This palette is indis-
pensable and you’ll need to use it frequently when creating dynamic forms.
 Data View. The Data View tab is where you make database connections. You may or may 
not need this tab open depending on the kind of form you design.
 Report/Warnings. The Report tab provides you with information about the form design. 
The Warnings tab is loaded when you select Window ➪ Report (or Warnings). This tab 
can be very helpful when creating a new form. The Warnings tab dynamically lists errors 
and messages for potential problems in your form.
 Script Editor. In Designer 7 the Script Editor opened by default. The Script Editor takes 
up some precious room at the top of the Designer window, and hiding it in Designer 7 
always required you to adjust the Script Editor to move it out of view. By default, the 
Script Editor is hidden in Designer 8 and 8.2. If you want to open the Script Editor so 
that you can write code in FormCalc or JavaScript, select Window ➪ Script Editor. You’ll 
notice in the menu command that you now have a keyboard shortcut to open and close 
the Script Editor. Press Ctrl+Shift+F5 and the Script Editor opens and closes on the key-
board shortcut. By default, leave the Script Editor hidden to provide you with more room 
for editing a form, and press Ctrl+Shift+F5 when you need to write a script.
 Design View/Preview PDF. The two tabs at the top of the layout area in the Designer 
window enable you to see the layout (Design view), and a PDF Preview of the form. The 
Design View and PDF Preview tabs appear by default. To open the Master Pages tab, 
select View ➪ Master Pages. Additionally, you can add another tab for viewing XML 
source code. Select View ➪ XML Source to display the tab.
 
When designing a form you need to view the form in PDF Preview in order to execute 
actions from fields and fill in data. Be sure to keep the two default tabs open for any 
design you create. If you lose a tab, look in the View menu to bring it back.
There are additional palettes and tabs you can load from the Window menu. The preceding list 
covers some of the most essential palettes you need for just about any form design. As you poke 
around the Window menu, a few other palettes that are self-descriptive can be added to your 
workspace. Be aware, however, that as you add more palettes to the workspace, you reduce the 
amount of work area you have to lay out your form design.
In addition to palettes, you also have options for displaying a number of hidden tools. By default, 
Designer opens with a limited tool set. You can add tools and load toolbars by selecting Tools ➪
Customize. The Customize dialog box opens where you can select additional tools and display 
several toolbars. In addition, you can create a custom toolbar by clicking the New button in the 
Customize dialog box and add the individual tools you want to use in a toolbar you design.

Understanding the Why for Adobe 
LiveCycle Designer ES
When you purchase Adobe Acrobat Pro or Adobe Acrobat Pro Extended, one of your first thoughts 
might be, “Why is Adobe providing me with a standalone program to design forms when I can do 
the job in Acrobat Pro?” This is an important question and you need to understand not only the 
purpose for using Designer, but also the advantages you have with using the program. As a matter 
of support, Adobe invests time equally between adding new features for AcroForms and LiveCycle 
Designer forms.
Adobe LiveCycle Designer is a client-based point-and-click graphical design application that sim-
plifies the creation of forms. In Acrobat you need to create a form design in another application, 
convert to PDF, and add form fields in Acrobat. Designer includes the ability to create the form 
layout as well as the form fields that your form recipient will populate with data, or you may bind 
a data source to your form and flow the data spawning fields and pages as needed. Forms created 
with LiveCycle Designer are intended to be delivered either as PDF or HTML that supports user-
defined data structures, like XML. In support of standards-based data formatting, such as XML, 
Adobe is de-emphasizing its proprietary FDF (Form Data Format) as a data exchange format and 
migrating to XML as an open standard. With tools that help you easily design forms through drag-
and-drop methods for handling images and form data fields, LiveCycle Designer is a tool that sim-
plifies data management and data exchanges.
It’s data handling that takes Designer to a level well beyond the capabilities of Adobe Acrobat. 
Form designers using LiveCycle Designer can create simple data-capture solutions and use the 
Acrobat products to consolidate data received from clients. The ability to easily transport data to 
and from other applications via XDP and XML format makes Designer a much less complicated 
and efficient solution than what you have available using Adobe Acrobat.
As of this writing, Macintosh users are at a disadvantage because Designer is available on Windows 
only. However, you may expect to eventually see Designer supported on both platforms as devel-
opment in technology applied to Designer is likely to increase, while Adobe still intends to com-
pletely support Acrobat PDF form technology. Considering the fact that Adobe is investing as 
much research and development into Designer as they are devoting to Acrobat, the more you know 
about Designer today, the better off you’ll be when future Acrobat products are released. If you are 
a serious form designer, you will want to begin using Designer right away.
Getting Started with a New Form Design
LiveCycle Designer offers you several options for designing forms when you first choose a menu 
command to create a new form. By default, when you launch Designer by double-clicking the 
application icon (or use the Start Menu or an application icon alias) you arrive at the Welcome to 
Adobe LiveCycle Designer Welcome screen. You can choose to dismiss the screen when you 
launch Designer by removing the check mark in the lower left corner of the Welcome screen where 

1053
Using Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (Windows Only)
33
you see Show this Dialog at Startup. If you click New Form in the Welcome screen or you select 
File ➪ New, the New Form Assistant Wizard opens as shown in Figure 33.3. Starting a Designer 
work session when creating a new form usually begins by clicking New Form in the Welcome 
screen or selecting File ➪ New. In both cases you start your project by first making a decision for a 
method to use from options in the New Form Assistant Wizard.
 FIGURE 33.3
The New Form Assistant Wizard opens by default when you first launch LiveCycle Designer.
As shown in the New Form Assistant Wizard, you have five different options for creating a form in 
Designer. These options are as follows:
 Use a Blank Form. This option opens a blank page where you add all the design ele-
ments on your new form. Essentially you start with a blank page and create the design 
using tools in Designer for text, graphics, and form fields.
 Based on a Template. Unlike Acrobat, you have a number of different preinstalled tem-
plate files that help you get started in creating a new form design. Click this option and 
the New Form Assistant changes panes to a view shown in Figure 33.4. From the scrolla-
ble list of different preinstalled form designs, select the design most similar to the kind of 
form you want to create and click Next.
 Based on a Spreadsheet. You have an option to create a form design from cells in a 
spreadsheet. You click through the Next buttons assigning different attributes to the form 
and on the last page in the New Form Assistant Wizard you’re prompted to copy cells in 
a spreadsheet document. You can leave the wizard pane open, launch Microsoft Excel, 
and copy the cells you want to appear as form fields. Close the Excel worksheet and 

1054

return to Designer. Once data is copied to the Clipboard, the Finish button is active. 
Click Finish and the copied cells are added as fields to a new form.
 FIGURE 33.4
Select a template you want to start with for creating a new design.
 Import a PDF Document. You can create a design in any authoring program and export 
to PDF. After PDF conversion, use the Import a PDF Document option and you can 
import the PDF into Designer. If you create a form design in Acrobat and import a PDF 
file containing fields, Designer recognizes the fields created in Acrobat.
 
When you choose Import a PDF Document and click Next in the New Form Assistant 
Wizard you identify a PDF document, click Next, and arrive at the Setup: Import Options 
pane shown in Figure 33.5.
 
Designer needs to know how you want to work with the PDF file. You have two options 
from the radio buttons in Figure 33.5.
 
Designer 8.2 supports a feature called PDF background artwork. When you select Create 
an Interactive Form with Fixed Pages, you are importing the PDF document as a back-
ground layer with the background appearing behind form fields (either from a PDF con-
verted with form fields or a PDF with no fields and fields you ultimately add in Designer). 
PDF background artwork cannot be edited for any content on the background layer. It’s 
important to note that you lose some of the benefits of creating original forms in Designer 
such as creating dynamic forms, using master pages, and using a grid. However, you have 
the advantage of maintaining the exact layout of the original PDF including color assign-
ment and font embedding.

1055
Using Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (Windows Only)
33
 
The Create an Interactive Form with a Flowable Layout option imports and converts the 
PDF into an XML template. In this case, you can edit the imported PDF content. If you 
choose this option you may find much of the original design such as graphics on the PDF 
layout not fully translated to the XML form.
 Import a Word Document. This option lets you import a Microsoft Word file as a new 
form design. Designer 8.2 (like Acrobat) has a run form field recognition function that is 
automatically run when you convert the Word file. All areas on the form design that 
clearly indicate form field positions such as lines, boxes, and so on are populated with 
form fields when the file opens in Designer.
 FIGURE 33.5
In the Document Setup: Import Options pane, you make a decision for how the PDF 
will be imported.
Creating a Simple Form in Designer
You follow several steps to create a form in LiveCycle Designer whether it is a form from a tem-
plate, starting with a blank new page, importing a PDF document, converting a Word file, or con-
verting a spreadsheet file. You typically follow steps initially in the New Form Assistant where 
Designer helps you by providing some options to decide how your form will be deployed and 
offering other choices depending on the type of conversion you decide to use.

1056

Creating a blank new page
All the form field attributes are assigned on any kind of form you create in Designer — whether 
you start from scratch or import a document. Let’s start off by creating a simple form in a blank 
document so you can see how a form is created in Designer. The initial steps follow.
STEPS: Creating a form on a blank page
 
1. Launch LiveCycle Designer. You can launch LiveCycle Designer from Acrobat 9 (you 
need to select Start Form Wizard and select “No Form” which will launch Designer) and 
the New Form Assistant opens where you make choices for creating a new form using 
one of the options shown in Figure 33.3. You can also use the Start menu to open 
Designer or double-click the program icon. Either of these choices opens the Welcome 
screen where you have choices for creating a new form, creating a form from a template, 
or opening an existing form.
 
2. Click New Form in the Welcome to Adobe LiveCycle Designer Welcome screen. 
Click the New Form button. (Note that if you want to open Designer without the 
Welcome screen opening, select the check box where you see Show this Dialog as Startup 
and remove the check mark).
 
3. Select Use a Blank Form in the New Form Assistant Wizard. After clicking New Form 
in the Welcome screen, the New Form Assistant Wizard opens. Click Use a Blank Form 
and click the Next button to open the Document Setup pane in the wizard.
 
4. Select a page size. In the Document Setup pane, select a page size from the Page Size 
pull-down menu. Select an orientation by clicking either the Portrait or Landscape radio 
button and select the number of pages you want from the Number of Pages pull-down 
menu. (Note that the maximum number of pages you can add in the wizard is 10; how-
ever, there is no limit to the number of pages that can be dynamically created in 
Designer.)
 
5. Click Next and select the return method. The final pane in the New Form Assistant 
Wizard is the Form Return Setup: Adding Buttons. Here you select a return method. If 
you want the form emailed back to you, select Add an email button. If you want the end 
user to print the form, select Add a print button. Note that you can choose both options, 
as shown in Figure 33.6.
 
6. Click Finish and your form opens in the Designer window. In Figure 33.7, you can 
see the start of my new form where I selected a 6 3/4 Envelope with a Landscape orienta-
tion for my page size and added an email button and submit button. I hid the left palettes 
by selecting Window ➪ Workspace ➪ Left Palettes. I also hid the Script Editor for now by 
pressing Ctrl+Shift+F5.

Save your file after you open the document in Designer. Be certain to periodically save the docu-
ment as you work through additional steps. When you select File ➪ Save (or Save As) the Save dia-
log box opens. The Save as type pull-down menu offers several options, but for this series of steps, 
don’t bother with all the options now. Select Adobe Static PDF Form (*.pdf).
If you are new to Designer and you’re familiar with other Adobe software, your first efforts in 
Designer are likely to be very frustrating. Adobe is the master of the free-form graphic design appli-
cations where you can click and grab an object in programs such as Adobe InDesign, Adobe 
Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Dreamweaver, and even to some degree in Adobe Acrobat. 
Just click with a selection tool and you have complete freedom of movement without obstruction. 
This is not the case with LiveCycle Designer.
There are structured elements in a Designer form and you can’t move objects around to the same 
degree as you can in other Adobe software. Before you add any content to the form, you should 
familiarize yourself a bit with some of the structural elements.
Click Master Pages in the Designer window and you see a rectangle appearing as a blue dashed 
rectangle. Select the rectangle and handles appear at the four corners and four midpoints on each 
side. This area determines the boundaries of your content. While in the Master Pages view you can 
click and drag handles to reshape the object. If you click the Design View tab, you see the same 
rectangle, but you can’t resize it while in the Design View mode. Any resizing you do in the Master 
A Word About Page Sizes
D
esigner offers you a huge number of fixed page sizes, but another limitation and an obvious 
indication that Adobe didn’t initially create this software product is that you have no option for 
creating a custom page size — something Adobe has always provided in programs to create freedom 
in the design environment. This probably won’t matter much to the IT-type people, but it surely will 
drive the graphic design people crazy.
If you want to create a custom page size that doesn’t fit within the sizes available in the Page Size 
pane in the New Form Assistant Wizard, you can create a custom page size in another program and 
import the file into Designer. Doing so, however, has some limitations.
If you create a blank page in Microsoft Word and import the page from a .doc file format, you can 
add text, images, and form fields to the document in Designer, but you won’t be able to see the 
design grid.
If you create a blank page and convert it to PDF, you can’t see the design grid; you can add form 
fields, but you cannot add any text or images to the design.
Your best option for creating a new form design is to try to find a page size in the New Form Assistant 
Wizard Page Size pull-down menu as near as you can to your desired page size. If you must create 
a custom page size, create your background in a design program with all the background elements 
and convert to PDF. Import the PDF file and you can add the form fields in Designer.

Pages view restricts all the elements in the Design view to the boundaries of the rectangle on the 
Master Page. In Figure 33.8, I moved the top side of the Master Page rectangle down, and my two 
buttons were moved in the layout to stay within the rectangle.
 FIGURE 33.8
Moving the rectangle on the Master Page moves all elements in the layout to keep them within the rectangle.
Working with master pages is not unfamiliar to people who create layouts in programs such as 
Adobe InDesign. Most layout programs offer you many options for creating master pages and plac-
ing elements on the master pages without having options to move the master elements on other 
pages. What’s different about Designer is that elements are created for you. Therefore, you need to 
poke through a design to discover items that you did not create and how they affect the form. This 
is particularly true when you start working with subforms, as I explain later in the section 
“Creating Dynamic Forms.”
Adding an image
Since you’re creating a design from scratch, you’ll import graphics as well as add graphic elements 
with tools in Designer. You can import a variety of different raster image formats including BMP, 
JPG, GIF, PNG, and TIF into your design.
In Designer 8.2 you now can also import EPS files. Like the image file formats, be certain your image 
color modes are all RGB. CMYK images won’t display properly in Designer. If you have problems 
importing an EPS file in your design, open the EPS in an image editor such as Adobe Photoshop and 
rasterize the image. Save the raster image as a TIFF file and you should have no problems.
TIP
TIP
If you create a Designer form that you will eventually output to press, use RGB 
images in your Designer form. Import the form in Adobe InDesign and let InDesign 
convert color from RGB to CMYK plus all the other print controls you need for prepress and 
commercial printing. Note that you lose many Print Production tools in Acrobat when you open 
forms created in Designer. As such, you’ll find InDesign a much better tool to print files for com-
mercial printing than Acrobat. For more information on prepress and printing, see Chapter 32.

To import images into a Designer form, follow these steps.
STEPS: Importing images into a Designer form
 
1. Open the Object Library palette. By default, the Object Library palette opens when you 
launch Designer.
 
2. Drag the Image Object to your document. The Object Library palette contains most of 
the objects you use in all Designer forms. You have field styles and objects for text and 
images. Locate the Image Object (not the Image Field Object) and drag it to the docu-
ment page. When the object appears on the page, drag open the handles to accommodate 
a rough size for your imported image. The size doesn’t have to be precise. You can make 
adjustments after importing an image.
 
3. Select an image to import. Open a context menu on the object and select Choose image 
(or simply double-click the object). When you release the mouse button the Browse for 
Image File dialog box opens. Locate the image to import, select it, and click the Open 
button. The image appears inside the Image Object, as shown in Figure 33.9.
 
4. Size the object. Drag the handles in or out to accommodate the size of the image without 
clipping it.
Using the Libraries
D
esigner provides you with several libraries containing the field objects and text objects you add 
to a form design. By default, you may see a single library open in the Libraries palette. Click the 
down-pointing arrow adjacent to the library name to collapse the palette and you’ll find the list of 
other libraries available to you. When you collapse all palettes you’ll see a right pointing arrow 
adjacent to each library name. Click any one of the right arrows to expand the respective library.
The installed libraries include My Favorites, Standard, Custom, and Barcodes. In these libraries 
you’ll find all the form field and object tools necessary to create any kind of form in Designer. The 
My Favorites library is designed for you to drag field objects you commonly use to this palette.
In addition to the four libraries Designer provides you with a Fragment library. The Fragment library 
is designed for you to add subforms, scripts, and other fragments of forms that you may commonly 
use. Drag elements to this library to create a list of commonly used objects and scripts.

Working with text fields
In Acrobat you click the Text Field tool in Form Editing Mode or draw a text field rectangle to cre-
ate a field where text (and numbers that are read as text) is added on a form. The Text Field 
Properties dialog box offers you a few choices for setting the field appearances such as border and 
fill colors, insets, embossing, dashes and underlines, and a few different line weights. Adding text 
fields in Acrobat presumes you have text descriptors in the form design for users to know what 
data to add to various fields. For example, you might have the text Name appearing in the back-
ground layout, and adjacent to the Name text you create a text field where a user types a name.
In Designer, you can add the text descriptors along with the field types (this applies not only to 
text fields but to most of the other field types you have available in the Library tabs). When it 
comes to appearances, Designer offers options similar to the way you can assign cell appearances

in spreadsheet programs. You can control many more field appearances in Designer than you have 
available in Acrobat.
To learn how to format text fields in Designer, follow these steps.
STEPS: Adding text fields to a form
 
1. Drag a Text field from the Standard (or Favorites) tab to the document page. From 
the same Library palette you selected an Image object from, click the Text Field object 
and drag it to the document page. Notice that you have a Text object and a Text Field 
object in the Standard tab in the Library palette. The Text object is used to add text on 
the page. The Text Field object permits you to add both text and a field to the page. Be 
certain to drag the Text Field object to the page.
TIP
TIP
If you want to quickly find objects and fields in the Library palettes, open the Insert 
menu and select Standard. From the submenu you can see all the objects/fields in 
an alphabetical list. Select any item in the submenu and the respective object is added to your 
document page.
 
2. Set the field appearance. Open the Object palette and click the Field tab. From the 
Appearance pull-down menu, select an appearance option. For my example, I select 
Underlined from the Appearance menu, as shown in Figure 33.10.
 FIGURE 33.10
Open the Appearance menu in the Field tab in the Object palette and select an option 
for a field appearance.
 
 Note that you also have an option for selecting a Custom appearance in the pull-down 
menu. Click Custom and the Custom Appearance dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 
33.11. From the Edges pull-down menu, you can select Edit Together or Edit Individually. 
The Edit Individually option lets you edit each of the four rectangle sides for border 
options. The Corners choices let you modify the corner appearances. The Style menu offers 
options for creating gradients and pattern fills.

 FIGURE 33.11
A number of different appearance options can be selected in the Custom Appearance 
dialog box.
 
3. Set the Value options. In the Value tab, you have some options for specifying the user 
requirements for filling in the field. From the Type pull-down menu you can force a field 
to be filled in by selecting the User Entered – Required option from the menu, as shown 
in Figure 33.12. Other options shown in the figure include choices for optional, recom-
mended, and calculations. Make a choice for the field value attributes and click the 
Binding tab.
 FIGURE 33.12
Make a choice for user data entry attributes in the Value tab.
 
4. Name the field. Type a name in the Name text box in the Binding tab. If you want to 
bind the field to a data source, click the icon to the right of the Default Binding text to 
open a pop-up menu. For a form that you email or submit for printing, the Default 
Binding is set at Normal, as shown in Figure 33.13.

1064

 FIGURE 33.13

NOTE
NOTE
The name you provide in the Binding tab is the field name. Text you type on the 
form adjacent to the field is a design issue and is not related to the form data.
 
5. Add the field caption. Formatting the data attributes is complete. Now you need to set 
up the field as it appears on the form. The first item to deal with is typing the text you 
want to place as the field caption. Click in the default Text Field caption that appears 
when you first drag a text field to the document page and drag across the text. Type a 
new name for the text. In my example I used Name, as shown in Figure 33.14, to indi-
cate the end user should type his or her name in the field.
 FIGURE 33.14
Type text you want to appear on the form adjacent to the text field.
 
6. Size the field. The default text may be too long or too short in relationship to the field 
position. You can add more or delete some space between the text you type for the field 
caption and the field. Move the cursor to the separator bar between the text and the field 
and drag left or right to size the space occupied by the text. When you move the cursor 
over the separator bar, the cursor changes appearance, as shown in Figure 33.15.
 FIGURE 33.15
Drag the separator bar left to expand the field area.

TIP
As you work with fields, by default the field appearance has a highlight around the 
field border. If you want to view the fields without the highlight, select 
View ➪ Object Boundaries (or press Ctrl+;). The fields will appear the same as when you open 
the form in an Acrobat viewer.
Formatting Text Fields
W
hen you drag a text field (or other field types) to the document page, the field appears with a 
text caption, by default, on the left side of the actual field, as shown in the following figure.
If you’re familiar with creating forms in Acrobat, the default appearance of many Designer fields is 
probably foreign to you. LiveCycle Designer includes a text caption bound to a field because, unlike 
Acrobat, Designer is intended to be a design tool as well as a form data creation tool. As such, you 
need methods for labeling fields in designs you create from blank new pages.
Designer does provide you with a text object tool that enables you to place text near a field to pro-
vide a field description or to use the bound text to describe the field. In many cases you’ll want to 
adjust the placement of text relative to the field, or you may want to completely get rid of the text. 
Designer provides you with all the tools you need for modifying the text appearance or eliminating 
text and reformatting the field, but it may not be completely intuitive.
If you want to eliminate the default formatting and create a field with a rectangle box, you need to visit 
several palettes. All the options for changing the appearance are not included in a single palette.
If you delete the text caption bound to a field by selecting the text with the cursor and pressing the 
Delete key, you end up with a field where the field contents are about one half to two thirds the size 
of the entire object. You’ll immediately notice a large empty space to the left of a field when the 
field is selected after deleting the text. Designer automatically reserves the space for you to add text. 
If you want to delete the reserve space, open the Layout palette and open the Position menu in the 
Caption area and select None. Note that selecting None when you have a text caption on a field 
object eliminates the caption and reserve space with one menu selection.

continued
That’s one palette down and two more to go. The next issue is the Sunken text appearance. If you 
want to eliminate that, you need to open the Object palette and click the Field tab. From the 
Appearance pull-down menu, select None to eliminate the embossed look on the field.
Your final step is to set the appearance to a solid border, underline, or whatever other type of 
appearance you want. Borders and fills are handled in the Border palette. Open the palette and 
select Solid from the pull-down menu below the Edges pull-down menu, as shown in the following 
figure.
 
You can minimize your palette selections a bit and set the margins to zero (0) in the Layout palette 
that substitutes for using the settings in the Object palette, but I find that for almost all designs you 
continually interact with these three palettes, so they should all be open and accessible when design-
ing any form.
When you want text bound to a field you may want to relocate the text to a position other than the 
default at the left side of the field. In the bottom left corner of the Layout palette is a pull-down menu 
in which you can reassign the text position. Open the Position pull-down menu in the Caption area 
of the Layout tab and make a choice for Left, Right, Top, or Bottom. The None choice in this menu 
eliminates the text entirely.
If you do decide to use text with your field, you may want the vertical or horizontal position of the 
text to be different than the default position that appears as Align Left and Align Top. To change the 
position alignment, you need to visit yet another palette. Open the Paragraph palette and click the 
icon for Align Left, Align Center, Align Right, or Justify (the first four icons in the Paragraph palette) 
and click Align Top, Align Center, or Align Bottom (for vertical alignment from the last three icons 
in the palette). These icons are shown in the following figure.
Duplicating fields
When you create a form in Acrobat, you can duplicate fields by pressing the Ctrl key and dragging 
a field to duplicate it (yet another standard Adobe convention). In Designer you can duplicate a 
field by pressing Ctrl+Alt+click and drag a field. You also have the standard Cut/Copy/Paste com-
mands in Designer, but if you create a number of different forms and you want field attributes to 
appear similar, you can store copies of fields in a custom library.

TIP
TIP
If you want to duplicate a field several times, press Ctrl+D. Designer duplicates a 
selected field. You can move the duplicate horizontally or vertically to a distance 
away from the original field — for example, 1/2 inch. Press Ctrl+D again and the next duplicate is 
created at the same distance — 1/2 inch in this case.
To add a custom library group to the Library palette, follow these steps.
STEPS: Creating a custom library group
 
1. Add a New Group. Notice the small icon at the top right corner of each Library tab. Go 
to the topmost icon in the Library palette and click the mouse button to open a menu. 
From the menu choices, select Add Group.
 
2. Name the new group. When you select Add Group, the Add Library Group dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 33.16. Type a name for your custom library group in the text 
box and click OK. The new group appears in the Library palette.
 FIGURE 33.16
Type a name and click OK in the Add Library Group dialog box to create a custom 
library group.
 
3. Drag the field you created on the form to the new group. Drag the field to the group 
name you see in the Library palette. Watch for the cursor to change to an arrowhead with 
a plus symbol, as shown in Figure 33.17. You need to place the cursor over the group 
name and release the mouse button when you see the cursor change appearance. Click 
the right arrow to expand the palette and you should see the field within the custom 
group tab. When you release the mouse button, the Add Library Object dialog box 
opens.
 
4. Type a name for your field in the Add Library Object dialog box. This name is used 
to merely identify the field in your custom group. It has no value and is not a default text 
object when you add the field to a page.
 
 Type a description in the Description text box. Notice a pull-down menu at the bottom of 
the Add Library Object dialog box in Figure 33.18. You can add an object to any group 
by selecting a group from the menu. Click OK and your new field is added to your cus-
tom library.

5. Add a field to the document page. Drag the field you added to your custom library to 
the document page. Position the field as you want it to appear in relation to the first field 
you created.
 
6. Change field attributes. Edit the text adjacent to the field and edit the name. You can 
change the name in the Binding tab or open a context menu on the object and select 
Rename Object. The Rename Object dialog box opens. Type a new name in the dialog 
box and click OK.
 
7. Add additional fields. Add more fields by dragging the field from your custom library 
group to the document page and format the fields.
 
8. Add multiple fields to your custom library group. Drag a marquee around the fields to 
select them and drag the selected fields to your library group. In the Add a Group dialog 
box, add a name and description. I named my group Identifying Information, as you can 
see in Figure 33.19.

You can alternately add objects to any library group by opening a context menu on 
a selected object and choosing the Add to Library menu command. The Add Library 
Object dialog box opens where you can add a name and description, and choose the library 
where you want the object to be stored.

The beauty and the power of using LiveCycle Designer when it comes to field duplication are in 
adding multiple fields to a custom library group. When you create new forms, you can drag the 
grouped item in your custom library group to a document page, and all the fields in that group are 
added to the document.
Field Naming Conventions Used by LiveCycle Designer
W
hen you drag a field from any library group to a document page, Designer automatically adds 
a field name to your new field. If you add a text field to a page, for example, Designer names 
the field in the Binding tab TextField1. The next time you drag a text field to the document page, 
Designer names the next field TextField2, and so on. This naming convention assures you that all 
fields have a unique field name.
Check boxes also follow the same conventions as other fields. However, radio buttons are named 
RadioButtonList and additional radio buttons you add to a page are named the same field name. 
When you open the form in Acrobat and click one radio button, it is turned on. Clicking another 
radio button in the same group turns the other radio buttons off.

Working with Tables
O
bviously, when you want to create multiple fields in columns and rows, dragging individual 
fields from a Library tab will take you quite a bit of time. Fortunately, Designer 8.2 provides 
you a feature for creating and editing tables that helps you automate adding tables on your forms. 
Much like the options we have in Acrobat for duplicating fields, you duplicate columns and rows in 
Designer using menu commands in the Table menu. However, Designer offers you much more than 
is available in Acrobat.
To insert a table, you select Table ➪ Insert Table. The Insert Table dialog box opens, as shown in the 
following figure, where you can define columns and rows and add a header and/or footer. Click OK 
and Designer creates a table automatically without your having to start out with any fields laid down 
on the page.
Much more power for designing a table is available in the Table Assistant Wizard, shown in this 
figure. Click the Create Table Using Assistant radio button in the Insert Table dialog box, click OK, 
and the Table Assistant Wizard opens.
Options available in the Table Assistant are similar to options for creating tables in Adobe InDesign 
or Microsoft Excel. You can add rows and columns, apply shading to alternating rows, add headers 
and footers, and divide the table into sections. After creating a table, you can apply edits using the 
Table menu for adding and deleting rows and columns, merge and split cells, and distribute and 
group sections.

Adding graphic objects to a form
In the Standard library group you have graphic objects in addition to field objects. The Line object 
and the Text object are used to draw lines and add text that’s not part of a field identifier.
Click the Line object in the Standard library group and draw a line on the form. Attributes for a 
line object are shown in the Object palette. You can edit orientation, line color, and line styles such 
as solid, dashed, dotted, and dots with dashes. Draw a line on your form to separate the fields cre-
ated in all previous steps from the bottom portion of the form.
The Text object is used to add text on a page. You might use text for a group identifier, a column head-
ing, and so on, where the text is not bound in any way to a field. Drag the Text object to the document 
page and click the cursor inside the text. Select the default text and replace it with the text you want to 
add to the object. If you want to assign attributes to the font and style, open the Window menu and 
select Font to open the Font tab. In the form I’ve created thus far, I added the text Acrobat User Level.
Adding radio buttons to a form
Radio buttons are intended to be used for mutually exclusive choices. You might use radio buttons 
on a form for asking for a credit card type where only one response is acceptable. As a user clicks 
one radio button, all other radio buttons are off. Clicking a second radio button deactivates the 
first radio button, and so on.
By default, LiveCycle Designer expects you to add radio buttons in this manner. If you want to use 
radio buttons for multiple responses, you need to set up some custom field attributes. For the sake 
of staying with standards, let’s look over how radio buttons are used with their default values.
STEPS: Adding radio buttons to a form
 
1. Drag a radio button from the Standard library group to the Designer page. Continue 
adding a few more radio buttons by dragging from the Standard library group to the doc-
ument page. In my example, I added three buttons, as shown in Figure 33.20.
 FIGURE 33.20
Drag three radio button fields from the Standard library group to the document page.

2. Change the field names. Click one radio button to select it and open the Binding tab in 
the Object palette. Type a new name in the Name text box. In my example I used userLevel 
for the field name, as shown in Figure 33.21. When you change the name of one field in a 
radio button group, Designer automatically changes all the objects in the same group to the 
same name. Note that alternately you can select an object and open a context menu. From 
the menu options, select Rename Object. Type a new name in the Rename Object dialog 
box and click OK. All radio button objects in the same group are renamed.
 FIGURE 33.21
Click the Binding tab in the Object palette and change the radio button name. All radio 
buttons in the same group are renamed.
 
3. Change the position of the radio button relative to the text. By default, a radio button 
appears to the left of the default text identifier. To change the position, open the Layout 
palette. At the bottom of the palette, click the Position pull-down menu. Select the posi-
tion you want for your radio button. In my example, I want the text to appear to the left 
of the radio button; therefore, I select Left in the menu as shown in Figure 33.22.
 FIGURE 33.22

4. Edit the text. In my example I edited the text for the radio buttons and added Beginning, 
Intermediate, and Advanced for the three buttons, as shown in Figure 33.23.
 FIGURE 33.23
Edit the text for each button to identify the button selection.
Adding a Drop-down list to a form
A drop-down list in Designer is the same as a combo box in Acrobat terms. The names are different 
but the attribute assignments are very much the same. Drop-down lists, like combo boxes, can be 
assigned permissions for custom text entry as well as custom options from a list appearing as a 
pull-down menu. You add list items in the Field tab in the Object palette, and Designer, like 
Acrobat, offers a choice for sorting the list names.
To learn how to add a drop-down list in Designer, follow these steps.
STEPS: Adding a drop-down list to a form
 
1. Drag the Drop-down List object from the Standard library tab to the document 
page.
 
2. Name the field. Open the Binding tab and type a field name or open a context menu and 
select Rename Object. In my example, I use the name jobRole.
 
3. Add a text caption. Type the name you want to appear on the form adjacent to the 
drop-down list.
 
4. Set the list attributes. Open the Field tab in the Object palette and click the + symbol in 
the List Items area. Type a name for your list and press the Return key. Continue adding 
list names and press the Num Pad Enter key when finished or press the Esc key.
 
5. Sort names. After you create a list, look it over and see if you want to reorder some of the 
items. If you want an alpha list and some items are out of order, select an item you want to 
move and click the up or down arrows to reorder the list, as shown in Figure 33.24.

6. Enable custom text entry. If you want a user to be able to add custom text, select the 
box where you see Allow Custom Text Entry.
Using the Object Editor
T
he Object Editor (formerly called the Field Editor in Designer 8.0) is accessed by selecting 
View ➪ Object Editor. When the Object Editor is on, selected field objects appear with a blue 
border and pop-up menus. At the top of a field object when the Object Editor is turned on, you can 
edit field names by clicking in the field box (1). At the bottom of the field object, a menu lists all field 
object types where you can convert a field object of one type to another (2). On the lower-right 
corner you can open a pop-up menu (3) where field object attributes can be changed and some 
commands available in the Edit menu appear.

Other field types available in Designer such as the List Box, the Check Box, and the barcode are 
also available in Acrobat. Use of the remaining fields follow similar steps: You rename fields in the 
Binding tab and assign various attributes in the Field and Value tabs.

Finishing up a form
I really don’t like the default appearances on the Submit by Email and Print Form buttons. As an 
optional task, open the Border tab and remove the fill from the buttons. Note that you can select 
both buttons and change the fill in one step.
For the last steps, select File ➪ Form Properties to open the Form Properties dialog box. Add docu-
ment title information in the Info properties. In my example, I added the document information 
you see in Figure 33.25.
 FIGURE 33.25
Fill in the document info fields and click OK.
Click OK and save your file one more time. Click the Preview PDF tab in the Designer window and 
the file displays as a PDF. Test the form by filling in the fields as shown in Figure 33.26. Be certain 
to observe the layout and design as much as you assess the field contents. In my example, I need to 
return to Design View and put a little more space between some of the fields and the text. To 
return to Design View click the Design View tab and make the necessary edits to the form. Click 
Preview PDF and again preview the form as it will appear in an Acrobat viewer.

Importing a PDF Document
When you design a form in an authoring program and export to PDF, you make some design deci-
sions for the field appearances. You have essentially two choices. You can design field appearances 
in your authoring program for field design attributes such as borders, fills, type fonts, and so on, or 
you can leave the design decisions to LiveCycle Designer.
There are pros and cons to designing layouts in either program. If you design field appearances in 
an authoring program and convert to PDF, after adding fields in Designer, you may need to go 
back to the authoring program to touch up the appearances. This requires you to go back and 
forth to polish your design because it can be difficult to anticipate the final look of your form while 
preparing it in the authoring program.
TIP
TIP
If you find yourself going back and forth between a layout in Designer and a layout 
in an authoring program to polish up your design, save the Designer form as a tem-
porary file. After you convert the final layout from an authoring program, you can open the tem-
porary file and copy the fields. Open the final layout in Designer and paste the fields. This saves 
you time because you don’t have to re-create fields each time you update a layout.
If you leave assigning field appearances up to Designer, then you may have problems trying to 
align fields because Designer doesn’t support using grids and snapping fields to a grid when work-
ing with PDF backgrounds.

I find adding the field appearances in Designer to be the best option for me. However, it’s a per-
sonal choice and you should determine the workflow that best suits your personal preferences. To 
see how to create a Designer form from a PDF document, let’s walk through a series of steps.
Converting a PDF document to a Designer form
Create a layout in your favorite authoring program. I typically use Adobe InDesign or Adobe 
Illustrator to create form designs, but I’ll deviate for this example and create a design in Microsoft 
Excel. Rather than import the Excel worksheet in Designer, I’ll use PDFMaker and convert to PDF. 
Excel worksheets can be converted to Designer forms, but when creating more than just numeric 
cells, the Designer conversion leaves much to be desired. Not all graphic objects get translated prop-
erly, and your design can appear as a mess if you copy and paste the cells from Excel to Designer.
Figure 33.27 is the layout created in Microsoft Excel that I want to use for my Designer form. On 
this form I have some numeric fields, a calculation field, and a signature field in addition to some 
text fields. As yet, no field appearances such as underlines, borders, or fills appear where the fields 
will fall on the page. I’ll add these items in LiveCycle Designer.

To begin the creation, you first need to open the form in Designer. The following steps show you how.
STEPS: Open a PDF document in LiveCycle Designer
 
1. Create a new document in Designer. If you launch Designer, the Welcome screen 
opens. Click the New Form button in the Welcome screen. If you already have Designer 
open, select File ➪ New or press Ctrl+N. By default, the New Form Assistant Wizard 
opens. If you have a PDF document open in Acrobat, select Forms ➪ Edit Form in 
Designer and click OK in the alert dialog box. 
 
2. Select Import a PDF Document in the Getting Started pane. Click the radio button in 
the first pane in the New Form Assistant Wizard.
 
3. Select the PDF file to import. Click the Next button in the wizard and you arrive at the 
Document Setup pane. Click the Browse button and locate your file to import. Select the 
file and click the Open button.
 
4. Choose how you want to work with the PDF file. Click Next and you arrive at the 
Document Setup: Import Options pane. Click the first radio button choice in this pane, 
as shown in Figure 33.28.
 FIGURE 33.28
Select Create an Interactive Form with Fixed Pages.
 
5. Add an email and print button. Click Next and you arrive at the last pane in the wizard. 
By default, the check boxes are selected for adding an email button and a print button. 
Leave the check box selections at the default choice and type your email address in the 
Return email address text box.
 
6. Open the form in Designer. Click Finish and a new form is created with a PDF back-
ground artwork.
 
7. Save the file. Before adding any fields, save the file and routinely press Ctrl+S to update 
your file as you add new fields.

Add text fields
My example form has the same identifying fields as the form I created earlier in this chapter in the 
section “Working with text fields.” In that section I added the identifying fields as a group to my 
custom library group. Unfortunately, you can’t add a group of fields when using a PDF back-
ground. The single text field I copied to my custom group, however, can be used.
I drag my single text field from the custom group to the document page, and all the attributes pre-
viously assigned to the field are copied with the field to the document page. Adding the identifying 
information is simply a matter of dragging a field from the custom palette, resizing the fields to fit 
the design, and continuing the steps to populate all the identifying information fields.
The Submit by Email button and the Print Form button may need some appearance alterations and 
placement on your form. Drag the fields to the desired position and open the Object palette. Open 
the Appearance pull-down menu and select Custom. In the Custom Appearance dialog box, 
choose the appearance options you want for borders and fills. (Refer to Figure 33.11.)
After adding the identifying fields and modifying button appearances, click the Save tool or press 
Ctrl+S to update the document.
Adding numeric fields
When you create a form in Acrobat, you use text fields for both text and numeric values. In 
Designer, you have two different field types — a text field and a numeric field. Because Designer 
has so many more attributes that you can assign to fields, having two separate field types makes it 
much easier to work through the different tabs in the Object palette.
NOTE
NOTE
You can type numeric values in text fields, but the data is read as text and not num-
bers. In order to calculate values, you need to use numeric fields.
To add and configure numeric fields in Designer, follow these steps.
STEPS: Assigning attributes to numeric fields
 
1. Open the Standard tab in the Library palette and drag a Numeric Field from the 
palette to the document page.
 
2. Set the field appearance attributes. Click the Field tab in the Object palette and select 
an appearance option from the Appearance pull-down menu shown in Figure 33.29.

 FIGURE 33.29
Select an appearance and display pattern.
 
3. Click the Patterns button to open the Patterns — Numeric Field dialog box, as shown 
in figure 33.30. Display patterns are used to format numeric values. A pattern such as 
$z,zz9.99 results in a figure like $5,432.66. If your total value exceeds the pattern, the 
result loses the pattern attributes. For example, using the same pattern with a number like 
10,345 results in 10345 in the field box. Both the currency symbol and the comma are lost. 
When you format fields, be certain to anticipate the largest value that might be added to a 
numeric field box and create a pattern to accommodate the largest size.
 FIGURE 33.30
Click a display pattern and click OK.
 
4. Name the field. Click the Binding tab, use the Object Editor, or open a context menu 
and select Rename Object to change the field name. The default name appears as 

1081

33
NumericField1. When we come to calculating fields, this name is a little long to type in 
the Script Editor. To simplify the job, I name my field “price.”
 
5. Size and position the field. Drag the handles to size the field and drag the field to posi-
tion on the form.
 
6. Format the text. If the text is too large, you can reduce the point size in the Font tab. 
Click the Paragraph tab and click the Right Justify icon shown in Figure 33.31.
 FIGURE 33.31
Click the Right Justify icon in the Paragraph tab.
 
7. Add the formatted field to your custom library group. Drag the field to the custom 
library group.
 
8. Add more numeric fields to the document page. Drag the numeric field from the cus-
tom library group to the document page and populate all the remaining fields that will be 
summed in a calculation. Don’t worry about aligning fields now; you’ll take care of that in 
the next steps.
NOTE
NOTE
In my example, I use just four fields. If I use a larger number of fields in a column or 
row, I would insert a table to create my fields. (See the sidebar “Working with 
Tables” earlier in this chapter).
Managing fields
Because you can’t use a grid view or snap fields to a grid when working with PDF background art-
work, you need some way to organize your fields in aligned positions, sizes, and distributions. 
Acrobat provides a number of context menu commands for sizing, aligning, and distributing fields. 
Fortunately, you have the same options in LiveCycle Designer through menu commands.
Follow these steps to organize your fields in a precise order.
STEPS: Organizing fields
 
1. Select the numeric fields on a form. Using my example I created four fields that will be 
used to enter data, and the result will be computed in another field. I drag a marquee 
through the fields and select Layout ➪ Align.
 
2. Align the fields. From the Align submenu select an alignment option. As shown in 
Figure 33.32, you have several alignment options. In my example, I chose 
Layout ➪ Align ➪ Left. (Note that all the alignment options in Designer have keyboard 
shortcuts assigned to the menu commands.)

1082
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 FIGURE 33.32
Select an alignment option from the Layout ➪ Align submenu.
 
3. Distribute fields. The top field in a column should already be in the correct position 
on the form. If it is not, drag the fields together, placing the top field in the proper 
position. Drag the bottom field to position the field at the bottom of the column. Select 
Layout ➪ Distribute ➪ Down. This command neatly positions the fields equidistant 
from each other.
 
4. Realign the fields. One very common use of a modifier in almost all programs is using 
the Shift key to constrain movement. Unfortunately, Designer doesn’t support constrain-
ing movement by using a modifier key. If you moved the bottom field down to position 
the field, you more than likely disturbed the left alignment in step 2. Realign the fields by 
selecting Layout ➪ Align ➪ Left.
Calculating fields
Designer supports two different scripting languages — FormCalc and JavaScript. FormCalc is a 
simple scripting language that follows syntax similar to spreadsheets. JavaScript is similar to the 
JavaScript you find in Acrobat, but some objects supported in Acrobat are not available in 
Designer. For example, the docTemplate object is not something you have access to in Designer.
Acrobat supports two scripting languages, too — Simplified Field Notation and JavaScript. 
Simplified Field Notation is also modeled after a spreadsheet language, and JavaScript is similar to 
Designer JavaScript.
You need to use one of the scripting languages in Designer to calculate data. Because Designer sup-
ports two languages, you have to tell Designer which language you want to use to create your cal-
culations. To see how you go about calculating field data in Designer, follow these steps.
STEPS: Calculating field data
 
1. Identify the language you want to use for calculations. You can dynamically switch 
between the two scripting languages in the Script Editor and make a choice for the language 

1083
Using Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (Windows Only)
33
you want to use when you decide to write a script. However, it’s always a good idea to set 
up some form properties when you begin to design a form. Among the properties you can 
assign to a new design is the default scripting language.
 
2. Select File ➪ Form Properties. The language you identify as your default scripting lan-
guage is handled in the Defaults tab in the Form Properties dialog box. When the Form 
Properties dialog box opens, click the Defaults tab. From the Default Language pull-down 
menu, select FormCalc as shown in Figure 33.33. For forms returned to you via email, be 
certain the Default Run At pull-down menu selection is Client.
 FIGURE 33.33
Select FormCalc for the scripting language.
 
3. Click OK in the Form Properties dialog box.
 
4. Format the target field. On my example form I have a field titled total. This field is the 
target for my calculation. Open the Object palette and click the target field and select 
Calculated – Read Only in the Value tab from the Type pull-down menu.
 
5. Open the Script Editor. Press Ctrl+Shift+F5 to open the Script Editor window. To reveal 
more space in the Script Editor, you can open the window by dragging down on the sep-
arator bar appearing between the page layout and the Script Editor. (See Figure 33.34.)
 
6. Type the calculation script in the Script Editor. Select calculate from the Show pull-
down menu and type the following formula in the Script Editor:
Sum (price[*])

1084

 This simple formula takes all the price number fields and sums them. In Figure 33.34 
you can see the steps taken to produce the calculation.

TIP
TIP
Programmers will tell you that FormCalc is a very easy scripting language, but noth-
ing is truly easy unless you have a fundamental understanding of some basic princi-
ples. In regard to scripting languages, the fundamental principles involve knowing key words 
and how variables are assigned. To understand more about FormCalc, look over some of the 
templates installed with Designer. On some forms you’ll find a few calculation fields. Open the 
Script Editor and consider how formulas are written in FormCalc. For additional information, 
look over the online help document. You can also find a manual on FormCalc by visiting 
http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/formcalc_2.0.pdf.
Adding a signature field
To complete the form, I’ll add a signature field that locks the field data after the form is signed. 
Follow these steps to complete the form.

1085
Using Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (Windows Only)

STEPS: Adding a signature field
 
1. Add a digital signature field. Open the Standard library tab and drag a Signature Field 
to the document page.
 
2. Format the appearance attributes. Open the Object tab and add appearance settings in 
the Field tab. In my example I added a border to my signature field.
 
3. Set the Signature properties. Click the Signature tab and click Lock Fields After 
Signing. This option renders all fields as Read Only, and the fields can’t be edited after 
signing the document.
 
4. Set the Signature Handler. If you don’t assign a signature handler, the end users can sign 
the form with any technology they have. Skip this step if you want to provide the option for 
using any signature handler. If you want to force a signature type, click Settings in the 
Signature palette to open the Signature Settings dialog box. In the Signature Handler pane 
shown in Figure 33.35, select Adobe.PPKLite (for example) from the Name pull-down 
menu and click OK. Note that this action forces a signature type on the form.

Creating Dynamic Forms
All of what’s been covered up to this point falls into the category the Adobe LiveCycle Designer 
people at Adobe Systems call static forms. The steps in all preceding pages of this chapter could be 
accomplished in Adobe Acrobat as well as with LiveCycle Designer. The real power of Designer, 
however, is producing what Adobe calls dynamic forms.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information on creating forms in Acrobat, see Chapter 34.
What exactly is a dynamic form? In Adobe LiveCycle Designer terms, a dynamic form is one that, 
among other things, can adjust itself to accommodate the data a user supplies or when flowing 
data in a form from a database file. This is to say that the form fields can grow in size and spawn 
new fields as dictated by user/database needs on a form. The options for adding more content to a 
dynamic form are in your hands. The choice to use them rests with the end user or the amount of 
data merged with the form. The magic in this dynamic atmosphere is that the end user can work 
with any Acrobat viewer to populate a dynamic form — even the Adobe Reader users. 
Furthermore, no special features need to be added to a PDF document for a Reader user to fill out 
a dynamic form.
For an example of a dynamic form, take a look at Figures 33.37 and 33.38. In Figure 33.37 I start 
in Adobe Reader filling in two data fields on a form that was created in LiveCycle Designer.

 FIGURE 33.37
Two data fields are filled in using Adobe Reader
Notice the Add a Detail Line button at the bottom of the form in Figure 33.37. When I click this 
button, the form spawns two new fields, and all the elements below the two fields are moved down 
to accommodate the added space on the form. In Figure 33.38, you can see that the Description 
field grows in size to accommodate my need for adding several lines of text by expanding the field 
as I type. The Grand Total line sums data added to the Total fields.

Keep in mind that this form is completed in Adobe Reader, and no special usage rights for Reader 
users have been added to the form. These kinds of dynamic forms can be created for use with 
printing forms or when managing forms on a server where data streams populate form fields.
ON the CD-ROM
ON the CD-ROM You can find a copy of the form shown in Figures 33.37 and 33.38 on the book’s 
CD-ROM in the Chapter 33 folder.
The anatomy of a dynamic form
When you work in Acrobat to create forms, you’re working in a static two-dimensional environ-
ment. Inasmuch as form fields simulate a layer-type behavior, you lay down the form fields on a 
flat page. In Designer, you work in a more three-dimensional environment. The distinguishing fea-
tures in a dynamic-form-creation environment include the separate areas of the form you have to 
work with. In Acrobat, you add form fields to a page in a single content area. Anywhere on the 
page is open territory for your form fields. Designer offers two primary areas where fields and con-
tent are added. These two areas include the Content area and Subforms. The various components 
of a dynamic form are shown in Figure 33.39.
 FIGURE 33.39
A dynamic form has several different components.
Boiler Plate
Fields
Subforms
Body Pages
Content Areas
Master Pages
Intelligent Document
XDP
PDF
XML
Before you can create a dynamic form, you need to clearly understand these components and how 
they relate to each other. Whereas you can start tossing fields on a page in Acrobat or when creat-
ing a static form in Designer, creating a dynamic form requires precision and planning. You need 
to know a little bit about what fields are going to be added and what kind of subform treatment 
the fields require before you start editing a form.
The various components of a dynamic form include the following:
 Boilerplate. Boilerplate objects are like headers and footers on PDF documents. If you 
want to add a page number or some text to your form pages, you use options for creating 
boilerplate type data.

1089
Using Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (Windows Only)
33
 Fields. Fields are added to a content area, and they are confined to an area defined as the 
content area. By default, when you create a new document or use one of the other meth-
ods to create a PDF form as I explained earlier in the section “Creating a Simple Form in 
Designer,” Designer defines the content area at the full-page size. This content area can be 
modified. If you inadvertently change the content boundaries and you don’t know why 
you can’t get fields to move to an area on your page, it can be very frustrating.
 Subforms. Subforms are the heart of the dynamic form in Designer. A subform is a 
defined area within the content area where you can add fields and objects. Subforms, 
among other attributes, can be defined to flow content. Flowing the content is what 
makes the form shown in Figure 33.38 a dynamic form. The area where you see the 
Description, Total, and GrandTotal fields was included in a subform in my original 
design. Without a subform, I wouldn’t be able to make the data flow.
 
It’s critical that you completely understand working with and using subforms if you want 
to create dynamic forms. As I said at the beginning of this chapter, LiveCycle Designer 
wasn’t developed from the ground up by Adobe Systems. The kind of elements Adobe 
surely would have included in Designer if Adobe first developed the program would have 
been layers and modifier keys to easily select nested objects on a page. These tools are 
simply not in Designer, and Designer has its own way of selecting and modifying objects 
that may be intuitive to the IT people, but surely it will drive the graphic design people 
crazy.
 
In Figure 33.40, the body page appears with two areas defined as subforms for this par-
ticular design. The dashed lines show the boundaries of the separate subforms.
 Body pages. Body pages are where you lay out your design, integrating components of a 
master page and content you add to the body page. You can have one or more body 
pages and one or more master pages in a Designer form. A form doesn’t require any con-
tent on a master page, but you do need at least one layout on a body page to create a 
form.
 Content areas. Content areas are where you place fields and objects on body pages. 
Content areas have defined boundaries, and you can place fields and objects only within 
the boundaries. You can have one or more different content areas on a body page.
 Master pages. Master pages in Designer are like master pages in layout programs. You 
have a separate tab in Designer to open a master page and add content. You might put 
some text and fields on a master page such as your identifying information, a purchase 
order or invoice number, and a date. When you click the Body page tab, the master page 
data is not selectable, just as when working with a layout program such as Adobe 
InDesign. You can have more than one master page on a form, and you can choose which 
master page to apply to a body page. In Figure 33.41 you can see the master page content 
in the Master Page view and the defined content area. When you open a body page, no 
content can be added to the area outside the dashed line.

1090
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 FIGURE 33.40
Two subforms are used in this dynamic form.
 Header and footer rows. If you are creating a dynamic area (something like a purchase 
order form) on a form template, you might typically create a table with a header (and 
optionally a footer) row. If you don’t use tables, you create a positioned subform with a 
header and trailer. The headers and trailers can be dynamic and will appear at the top 
(and bottom) of each new page that’s added to a form to accommodate additional data 
when imported from a database or filling out a form.
Setting up the form properties
When you create a blank new form or open a document you want to use as a form, your very first 
step is to set up the form properties. You’ll want to address properties before you start working 
with the object and field tools in Designer.
To open the Form Properties dialog box, choose File ➪ Form Properties. The default tab in the 
Form Properties dialog box is the Info tab, as shown in Figure 33.42. Fill in the Title, Description, 
Author, and Contact fields in this pane.

Working with subforms
Perhaps the most difficult part of learning LiveCycle Designer is understanding subforms and the 
scripting languages. To create dynamic forms, you need some comprehension of both. Subforms 
are used to make your forms dynamic so you can flow data and populate your forms with new 
content on demand.
When you first begin to prepare a form for dynamic content, you need a mini paradigm for your 
workflow to understand the direction in which you want to proceed to create a dynamic form. In a 
simplified outline here’s the order of how you approach creating a dynamic print form.
 
1. Set the form properties. As I’ve explained already in this chapter, set up the form prop-
erties in the Form Properties dialog box.
 
2. Create the Master Page (per UI) layout. Add all the objects and fields you want to 
appear on your master page and set the Content area below/above the master page 
objects.
 
3. Create the layout with objects and fields. For a first effort in Designer, try to lay out 
the document as you want it to appear when distributed. Notice that you first create the 
layout here before you start creating subforms.
 
4. Add the subforms for your design. Subforms can be added to your layout as you design 
a form or after the initial design has been created. If you add subforms while designing a 
layout, you can easily get confused, and it’s much more difficult to rearrange elements 
when you have several subforms on the page.

1093
Using Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (Windows Only)
33
 
5. Add scripts to field objects. You need all the field objects and the subforms on the page 
in order to add scripts that invoke actions. This would be the last step in your design 
process before you preview the form.
When you graduate to binding fields to data, you’ll have a good idea for how forms are created in 
LiveCycle Designer, and you can choose to bind data and when to add subforms to suit your own 
personal needs. For an introduction to LiveCycle Designer, try to follow the steps outlined here 
and practice creating enough dynamic forms so you completely understand all the elements and 
how to arrange and modify them. Try to get a handle on working with subforms before you begin 
to delve into binding data to fields and forms.
Adding subforms to a document
There are three locations from which you can add subforms to a document. The most common 
method is using the Hierarchy palette. (See “Using the Hierarchy palette” later in this chapter.)
Another method is to use the Insert ➪ Standard menu, and from the submenu select Subform. This 
menu command adds a subform to the center of the open document page. Subforms can be added 
to both Master Pages and Body Pages (Design View).
The other way you can add a subform to a document is to open the Standard library palette and 
drag the Subform tool to the document page, as shown in Figure 33.44.
 FIGURE 33.44
Click the Subform tool and drag a subform to the document page.

1094
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
If you start with a subform on a page, you can drag objects and fields within the subform rectangle 
to bind them to the subform. You can also cut or copy objects and fields, add a subform to the 
page, resize it by dragging the handles on a selected subform, and then paste. When you paste 
Clipboard data on the page containing a selected subform, the data is pasted into the subform, 
which also results in binding the data to the subform, as shown in Figure 33.45.
 FIGURE 33.45
Two data fields are contained within a subform.
If you add a subform to a page after creating fields and the subform appears on top of the fields, 
you haven’t bound the fields to the subform. Any effort to flow data or work with subform proper-
ties respective to the data fields won’t be possible.
Using the Hierarchy palette
If there’s any gold in LiveCycle Designer, it’s in the Hierarchy palette. This palette dynamically lists 
all the assets included in your Designer form. Data connections and XML file links are handled in 
other palettes, but the objects, fields, and subforms you add to a form are all here in the Hierarchy 
palette.
When you create a new document and open the Hierarchy palette on the left side of the Designer 
workplace, you see the items Designer automatically added to the new blank page. In the 
Hierarchy palette you see an untitled Subform. If you have more than one page, you’ll see an unti-
tled Subform for each page, and the subforms are denoted according to page number so they can 
be easily distinguished from one another.
Click on the “(untitled Subform) (page 1)” item in the Hierarchy list and you see the content area 
selected on the blank page, as shown in Figure 33.46. Every Designer document including static 
forms has at least one root subform and a defined content area. If you attempt to delete the sub-
form shown with handles in Figure 33.46, Designer won’t let you do it. This is a must when work-
ing with Designer.

33
 FIGURE 33.46
Click (untitled Subform) (page 1) in the Hierarchy palette and the default Content area is selected.
NOTE
NOTE
If you use a PDF background artwork, you can’t use subforms. Subforms require 
XML templates, which are negated by importing a PDF as background artwork. All 
forms using PDF background artwork are static forms.
If you reduce the size of the Content area, all the objects, fields, and additional subforms will be 
confined to your new Content area size. If you find you can’t move an object to the edge of your 
form, go back and check the Content area. Chances are you sized the rectangle to a smaller size 
than you thought.
Using the Hierarchy palette you can precisely define the sizes of your subforms and bind the ele-
ments on your page to the subforms you create. To see how you approach designing a dynamic 
form with subforms, follow these steps.
STEPS: Designing a dynamic form
 
1. Create a new blank document. Create a new blank document and set up the Form 
Properties as mentioned in the section “Setting up the form properties” earlier in this 
chapter.
 
2. Create your layout. Add fields and objects to a master page and to the body page shown 
in the Design View using tools covered in the section “Creating a Simple Form in 
Designer” earlier in this chapter. Lay out your form page as precisely as you can. Size 
fields and objects and place them in the position that you want them to appear in your 
final layout.

1096
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 
3. Organize the objects. Open the Hierarchy palette and move the objects around in an 
order that will make it easy to group objects together in subforms. The logic should look 
the same as the final design you want to create.
 
 The Hierarchy palette works very similar to the Bookmarks panel in Acrobat. You can 
click and drag items in the list up or down to reorder them. Items can also be nested in 
parent/child relationships like Acrobat’s bookmarks. The Hierarchy palette for my exam-
ple form is shown in Figure 33.47.
 FIGURE 33.47
The Hierarchy palette is used to organize the content on the form.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on working with bookmarks in Acrobat, see Chapter 22.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Be absolutely certain to order the objects together that need to be grouped in a 
common subform, and double-check your layout to be certain the design appears 
as you want before creating a single subform. If you create one or more subforms and then try to 
move objects around the Hierarchy palette, you’ll have a nightmare of a time trying to get the 
order correct by moving objects on either the document page or in the Hierarchy palette.
 
4. Add a subform. Start at the top of the Hierarchy palette and select items that belong to 
one subform group. Open a context menu from the selected fields in the Hierarchy pal-
ette and choose Wrap in Subform from the menu choices. Your new subform is created 
with an untitled label. To rename the subform, open a context menu on the new untitled 
subform and select Rename Object. Type a new name for the subform and press the 
Enter key on your keyboard.

You can also rename subforms in the Binding tab in the Objects palette.
 
 In my example, I renamed the default root subform rootSubform, and I added a new sub-
form for the header data and named the subform HeaderData, as shown in Figure 33.48. 
My new subform will be added as a child item below the root subform (rootSubform) in 
the Hierarchy palette.
 FIGURE 33.48
I created a new subform for the header data on my form and named it HeaderData.
 
5. Insert a subform. I have several content areas that need to flow on my example form. I’ll 
go ahead and create a parent subform without binding any data to the new subform. To 
do this, I find an empty spot in the Hierarchy palette below all the items in the list, and 
without any object selected I open a context menu and select Insert Subform. This new 
subform is a child to the root rootSubform. (See Figure 33.49.)
TIP
TIP
To clear all items in the Hierarchy palette, click the cursor in an open area on the 
document page.
 
6. Move a subform in the Hierarchy palette. You reorder subforms in the Hierarchy pal-
ette just as you reorder bookmarks in Acrobat, and the way bookmarks are ordered in 
Acrobat is precisely the way Designer handles moving the subforms around the palette. 
To nest a subform as a child subform, click and drag up to the subform you want as the 
parent. When the parent subform is highlighted, release the mouse button and the new 
subform is nested below the parent as a child subform. To move objects in and out of 
subforms, you drag around the palette and move horizontally to nest objects below other 

1098

children in other subforms. At times it can feel a little awkward, but a little practice gets 
you up to speed fast.
 
 On my example form, I moved my new inserted subform below the HeaderData subform 
but not as a child to the HeaderData. This new subform is a child to the root subform in 
my document. The position of the new item is shown in Figure 33.49. After moving the 
new subform, I renamed it “detail.”

New Subform
 
7. Nest additional subforms under the inserted subform (now named detail). On my 
example form, I have four different groups I want to flow in my document. Later, I’ll tar-
get the new inserted subform as a Floating subform and the remaining subforms as 
Content subforms (see “Subform types” coming up next in this chapter). All subforms 
nested below a Flowed subform will flow the content.
 
 To create the new subforms, I select the objects I want to group in a subform, and from a 
Context menu I select Wrap in Subform. I create four new subforms and name them 
GroupLeaderSubform, item, GroupTrailer, and GroupTotal. In Figure 33.50 I collapsed 
the HeaderData subform, and my four new subforms according to parent/child relation-
ships are shown with the content grouped for each item.
 
8.  Save the document. If you find that things get scrambled a little,  save your file under a 
new filename so you can return to a previous file before you encountered any problems. 
When your design looks like things are working out as expected,  save your edits regularly. 
If you created a similar type of document as the example shown here,  save the file now.

menu.
Subform types
Designer provides you two options for setting subform attributes. You can define a subform that 
flows content or a positioned subform where the content remains static. As you might imagine 
when you format a subform to flow content, the form takes on dynamic attributes that enable you 
to create a form that spawns new fields and accommodates sizing fields according to the amount of 
user data added to a given field. A subform formatted for positioned content doesn’t flow on a page 
within its own subform, but may flow according to attributes of the parent subform. If the field 
attributes are defined to Allow Multiple lines for positioned content, the text exceeding the field 
borders is set up to be viewed in a scrollable window. In other words, the field doesn’t grow to 
accommodate the text.
When you select a subform in the Hierarchy palette and open the Object palette, your options 
are very different than those you have with other objects and form fields. Using my example 
file, I click on the detail subform and take a look at the Object palette. This subform is the one 
I want to format for a data flow. From the Object palette, open the Content pull-down menu; 
you see two choices. For my detail subform I want the Flowed option you see in Figure 33.51. 
The other four fields appearing as children under my detail subform are formatted as 
Positioned subforms.

 FIGURE 33.51
Open the Object palette and click the Subform tab. Select Flowed from the Content pull-down menu.
Below the Content pull-down menu is another pull-down menu for selecting the direction of the 
flow. The Flow Direction pull-down menu options are available only when formatting the subform 
to flow text. The first menu item is Top to Bottom. As the name suggests, data is flowed from the 
top of the page toward the bottom. The second menu choice is Western Text. This option flows 
data from left to right beginning at the top of the subform and continuing across to the right. The 
next flow of data is in the second row left to right, and so on. On my example form, I chose the 
Top to Bottom option for this design.
One more item in the Subform tab in the Object palette is the check box for Allow Page Breaks 
within Content. Select this box if you want the data to flow across multiple pages.
In the Object palette, you also have another tab that relates specifically to subforms. Click the 
Pagination tab and you have options for flowing content and handling data overflows. The options 
you have in this tab are generally applied to flowing data into XML forms from external data 
sources. In my example file, I left the options at the defaults, as shown in Figure 33.52.
 FIGURE 33.52
Leave the Pagination tab at the default settings.
Calculating data
Another book the size of Adobe Acrobat 9 PDF Bible could be written on just the JavaScript and 
FormCalc scripting languages supported by LiveCycle Designer. In Chapter 36 (on the CD-ROM), 
I talk about JavaScript and all the code listings in that chapter. With the exception of using the 

1101
Using Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (Windows Only)
33
docTemplates object, the JavaScript in Chapter 36 (on the CD-ROM) is equally applicable to 
Designer. To learn more about Acrobat and Designer JavaScript, download the Acrobat JavaScript 
Scripting Guide at www.adobe.com/devenet/acrobat/javascript.
For more information on FormCalc, a manual is available on Adobe’s Web site at www.adobe.
com/devenet/. Both the JavaScript and FormCalc manuals should be stored locally on your 
hard drive when creating forms in either Designer or Acrobat.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on using JavaScript, see Chapter 36 (on the CD-ROM).
In terms of the example form I’ve used in this section, the form requires only a single short script 
to complete the design. If you could create the same design in Adobe Acrobat it would take pages 
of JavaScript to produce the same results. In Designer, you need to add only a few lines of code to 
complete the design.
The actions for spawning fields and expanding field sizes in Designer are automatic and don’t 
require any special scripting code. If you set up your subforms correctly, Designer handles all you 
need for managing the data fields on my example form. What you do need, however, is a script to 
tell your Acrobat viewer to calculate the total data and when you want to spawn new fields. These 
two scripts belong to the GrandTotal field for summing the data and the btnAdd field on the 
Add a Detail button.
Here’s what to do to add scripts that will sum data and spawn new fields.
STEPS: Add a script to a Designer form
 
1. Select the field to sum a total. Open the Hierarchy palette and click the field where the 
data sum is calculated. In my example form, I click the GrandTotal field.
 
2. Open the FormCalc Script Editor. Press Ctrl+Shift+F5 to open the script window at the 
top of the Designer window and select FormCalc from the Language pull-down menu.
 
3. Type the code to calculate a sum. Select calculate from the Show menu and type the 
following code in the Script Editor window, as shown in Figure 33.53.
Sum($form.invoice.#subform[0].detail.item[*].total)
 FIGURE 33.53
Select FormCalc from the Language pull-down menu, select calculate from the Show 
pull-down menu, and type the code in the Script Editor.

4. Select the btnAdd button in the Hierarchy palette.
 
5. Type the following script in the FormCalc Editor:
detail.item.instanceManager.addInstance();
GroupTotal.GrandTotal.execCalculate();
 
 The first line of code adds the instance for spawning new fields and flowing the fields on 
the form. The second line of code executes the GrandTotal field calculation.
 
6. Set the button properties to hide the button when printing. One last item to deal with 
before your form is complete is to change the button properties. On my example form, I 
want the Add a Detail item for the btnAdd field to be invisible when the form is printed. 
The Add a Detail text and the button field are one item. The field has a caption assigned 
to it for the Add a Detail text. Click the btnAdd field in the Hierarchy palette and open 
the Field tab in the Object palette. Select Visible (Screen Only) from the Presence pull-
down menu, as shown in Figure 33.54.
 FIGURE 33.54
Select Visible (Screen Only) to hide the button when the file is printed.
 
7. Save your form and test it in Acrobat by clicking the Preview PDF button in 
Designer.
Distributing forms
Distributing forms from LiveCycle Designer is handled the same as you distribute forms from 
Acrobat. In Acrobat 9 you have more options for distributing forms and collecting data. Check out 
Chapter 35 to learn more.

Run-time events
When you browse the Designer menus, you’ll notice that the Insert menu lists a number of differ-
ent commands that always seem to be inaccessible. You may wonder what these commands do and 
how to make them active. The commands require a little different treatment than the fields and 
objects you add to pages from other areas in the Insert menu or the Library palette. The items you 
see grayed out in Figure 33.55 are special properties that are assigned to a few objects and used for 
run-time events.
 FIGURE 33.55
The first eight commands in the Insert menu are used for run-time events.
Run-time is when an application or server retrieves a form design and, among other things, might 
merge data with the form. In a very simple way, something like executing a mail merge from a 
word processing program is a run-time event. When you merge the data from a letter, for example, 
the data is introduced into the letter template merging a data form and a data file with a design 
producing new pages. A run-time event is also when you open the form in Acrobat. You might 
want the current date reported on a form when a user opens the form in an Acrobat viewer. 
Reporting the date when the file opens is also a run-time event.
Designer provides you tools to display certain types of information at run-time. Where and how 
you insert run-time properties is limited to a few objects. These objects are as follows:
 Text. A text object can be used to insert a run-time property.
 Text Fields. Text fields can be used to insert a run-time property.
 Numeric Fields. Numeric fields can be used to insert run-time properties.
To format a text object with a run-time property, you insert the cursor in the text object and then 
open the Insert menu. When the cursor appears inside the text, the grayed out items in Figure 
33.56 are all made active. When you want to format a run-time property for a text field or a 
numeric field, select the field and open the Object palette. From the Type menu you have only one 
choice to format the field for a run-time property. Select Calculated – Read Only from the menu 
options. Below the menu, click the Runtime Property radio button and open the pull-down menu 
to select a run-time event, as shown in Figure 33.56.

1104
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 FIGURE 33.56
Text fields and numeric fields are formatted for run-time events in the Object palette.
All run-time properties are available to Static Text objects. Text fields can use all properties except 
the Current Date/Time. Numeric fields can use only properties that report data in numbers such as 
the Current Page Number, Number of Pages, Current Sheet Number, and Number of Sheets. All 
other properties are not allowed with this field type.
The options you have for formatting include the following:
 Current Page Number. Places the current page number respective to the page where the 
field properties are assigned.
 Number of Pages. You might use this property to report the total pages in a dynamic 
form that flows data, adding new pages until the data is exhausted.
 Current Date/Time. Reports the current date and time.
 Viewer Locale. This property is used to report the locale for the application that is pro-
cessing the form. For example, you might design a form in the United States and the form 
may be processed in India. The field result would report India for the locale.
 Viewer Name. Reports the Acrobat viewer name. If the form is run in Adobe Reader, for 
example, Adobe Reader is reported in the field.
 Viewer Version. Reports the Acrobat viewer version (such as 8).
 Current Sheet Number. Reports the sheet number. If the form produces 10 sheets of 
paper and the field is on sheet 10, the number reported is 10.
 Number of Sheets. Reports total sheets produced.
To understand more about inserting properties for run-time events, follow these steps to report a 
current date.
STEPS: Assigning run-time properties to a text object
 
1. Open a form or create a blank new form.

1105

2. Add a static text object to the page. Select Insert ➪ Standard ➪ Text or drag the text 
object from the Standard library palette. Be certain to use the Text object and not the 
Text Field object.
 
3. Drag across the default text and type the text you want to appear on the form. In my 
example I use “This form is completed on:”. I’ll insert a date that will calculate at run-time.
 
4. Insert a date. While the cursor appears in the text box, select Insert ➪ Current Date/Time 
(alternately open a context menu and select Current Date/Time). You’ll see the text fol-
lowing the text you type appear as {current date/time} as shown in Figure 33.57.
 FIGURE 33.57
With the cursor in the static text field, select Insert ➪ Current Date/Time.
 
5. Preview the file in Acrobat. Click Preview PDF and the file opens in Acrobat. The date 
is reported as you see in Figure 33.58.
 FIGURE 33.58
When opened in Acrobat, the date is reported in date, hours, and minutes.
 
6. Save the file from Designer.
 
7. Open the file in Acrobat, save it, and close the file.
 
8. Reopen the document in Acrobat. Wait a few minutes until you’re certain the time has 
changed significantly since you last viewed the file in Acrobat. You’ll notice that the date 
remains fixed to the date stamp when you first opened the file. The field data was created 
at run-time in Acrobat when you first opened the file. After saving in Acrobat, the field 
data is static and won’t run again.
Enabling Forms with Reader Extensions
Adobe LiveCycle Designer has no direct command for enabling PDFs with Adobe Reader exten-
sions. If you select the File ➪ Distribute Form command in Designer, the Form Distribution 
Options Wizard opens in Acrobat. When you distribute a form, the form is automatically enabled 
with usage rights for Adobe Reader users. Reader users can fill out the form and save the form data 
before submitting the form back to you.

1106

Whereas many editing features for static and dynamic Designer forms are lost in Acrobat, the 
enabling commands are accessible for any kind of Designer form. You can choose to enable a 
Designer form for Commenting in Adobe Reader using the Comments ➪ Enable for Commenting and 
Analysis in Adobe Reader command, and you can enable the form for saving field data, commenting, 
and digital signatures using the Advanced ➪ Extended Features in Adobe Reader command.

Creating Data Connections
Binding fields in a form design to a data source is one of the true great features in LiveCycle 
Designer. If using Acrobat to bind to data sources, you need to have a sophisticated level of 
JavaScript programming background and a lot of finesse to create the resources that successfully 
bind data to other sources. With Designer, the process is greatly simplified and the program does 
much of the mind-wrenching work for you.
When binding fields on a form design to a data source, you create an association between the form 
and some data source that lets you capture, process, output, and print information from the data 
entries on a form. Designer enables you to bind data either as client-side, where you might bind 
data locally on a hard drive to a backend database file, or as server-side binding. Client-side bind-
ing enables you to make changes immediately to the data, while server-side binding requires you 
to submit data to a server where changes are made.
You create a new connection to a data source by opening the Data View palette and clicking the 
icon in the top right corner of the palette to open the palette menu. Choose New Data Connection 
from the menu and the New Data Connection Wizard opens as shown in Figure 33.59.
 FIGURE 33.59
Choose New Data Connection from the Data View palette menu and the New Data Connection Wizard 
opens.

1107
Using Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (Windows Only)
33
In the New Data Connection Wizard, you make a choice for the type of data connection you want.
XML schema and XML data sources
You can import an XML schema definition into a form design and then bind objects in the form to 
elements in the XML schema. If you have an XML file and not an XML schema, you can bind 
objects to the XML data form. The process for binding both a schema and a file are similar. The 
option that differs between the two is selecting which source you want in the New Data 
Connection Wizard.
To create an XML schema connection, select File ➪ New Data Connection or click the icon in the 
Data View palette to open the New Data Connection Wizard. In the New Data Connection Wizard, 
select XML Schema or Sample XML Data. Click Next and click the icon you see with an i appear-
ing over a folder on the far-right side of the Select XML Schema File text box. Browse your hard 
drive and select the XML schema file. Click OK and the file is added to the Select XML Schema File 
text box, as shown in Figure 33.60. For connecting to a Sample XML Data File you have the same 
options for selecting the file in a similar wizard pane.
 FIGURE 33.60
Click the icon to the right of the text box to select the XML Schema file.
Connecting to OLEDB data sources
OLE Databases (OLEDB) are sets of Component Object Model (COM) interfaces that provide 
applications with uniform access stored in diverse information sources. In short, these interfaces 
support DBMS (Database Management Systems) functionality appropriate to the data source that 
enables it to share data. You might have databases such as Microsoft Access files, Excel spreadsheet 
files, or other database types that you want to share data with PDF forms. You might have a situa-
tion in which you use a single identifying field a user types into a form, such as an employee ID or 
Social Security number. Using this one piece of data, you can connect to a database to retrieve 
additional information (or records) associated with this information.

1108
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
To dynamically edit data in your database file, you make a connection to the database and then 
bind fields on the form to the corresponding columns in the database.
Designer supports a number of OLEDB drivers. Click the OLEDB radio button in the New Data 
Connection Wizard and click the Next button. The second pane in the wizard prompts you for the 
Connection string. Click the Build button and the Data Link Properties dialog box opens, as shown 
in Figure 33.61. The list in the figure shows you the supported drivers.
You need to name your connection and set up your database connection string. Setting up a data-
base connection string may require you to research your database user manual. From the Provider 
tab you select the OLEDB provider, and then click the Connection tab to specify the source of the 
data. A number of different options appear in the Connection, Advanced, and All tabs. In order to 
make an effective connection, you need to thoroughly understand your database file and the many 
options you have to specify the properties for the connection.
 FIGURE 33.61
Click Build in the New Data Connection Wizard and the Data Link Properties dialog box opens. Select a 
data connection you want to make from the list of providers.
WSDL file
Web Services are applications that run remote over the Web. For example, your form might 
include a field where the current mortgage rate needs to be calculated. You can connect to a Web 
Service that determines the daily mortgage rate based on your address. A Web Service Description 
Language (WSDL) is an XML document (or file) that describes the Web Service and the services 
and operations (or methods) offered by the service. The connection supports a number of opera-
tions. The WSDL file defines the request and response requirements (or syntax) for each operation. 

1109
Using Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (Windows Only)
33
Input messages are sent to a server. The server can then reply with an output message. Using 
Designer you can create and bind fields in a form design to one of many different Web Services.
Aside from connecting to a WSDL via the New Data Connections Wizard, you can:
 Bind one or more operations within one or more Web Services.
 Attach fields, subforms, and exclusion groups to the execution of a Web Service opera-
tion using a button click event.
 Execute a Web Service operation from any event by way of a script.
 Enable script access to all returned elements of a Web Service regardless of whether those 
elements are bound to fields.
 Use Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) 1.1 style communication.
 Exchange data with a Web Service by using doc/literal exchange format SOAP can be 
either Doc/literal or RPC/encoded. Doc/literal supports drag and drop for automatic pop-
ulation of Data View.
 Write client-side scripts by using the Acrobat SOAP JavaScript Object, which supports 
RPC/encoded. If you use RPC/encoded, you have to do all the connections by hand using 
JavaScript.
To connect to a WSDL service you need to find it on the Internet. You can find lists of WSDL ser-
vices by visiting www.webservicex.net and www.xmethods.net. Both these sites post links 
to WSDL services. To make a connection to a WSDL service and design a form utilizing WSDL 
data, follow these steps.
STEPS: Binding data to a WSDL service
 
1. Create a form design in LiveCycle Designer. If you want to test a WSDL connection, 
you can use a blank new page; otherwise, create a form where you want to introduce the 
WSDL connection data. Open your form or create a blank new page.
 
2. Open a WSDL service in your Web browser. Use one of the services listing WSDL 
Web sites (www.webservicex.net or www.xmethods.net) and click a link to a ser-
vice you want to use. In my example, I use a currency exchange service located at www.
webservicex.net/CurrencyConvertor.asmx?WSDL.
 
3. Copy the Web URL from the location bar in your Web browser.
 
4. Open the New Data Connection Wizard. Switch to LiveCycle Designer. You can leave 
your Web browser open and use the Windows status bar to open your form in Designer.
 
 Select File ➪ New Data Connection or open the Data View palette and click the icon in 
the palette to open a pull-down menu and select New Data Connection. In the New Data 
Connection Wizard, select WDSL as shown in Figure 33.62.
 
5. Paste the copied URL in the New Data Connection Wizard. Click the Next button 
and paste the copied URL in the text box, as shown in Figure 33.63.

Open the New Data Connection Wizard and select WSDL File for the connection type.
 FIGURE 33.63
Paste the copied text in the WSDL File text box.
 
6. Select an operation. Click the Next box and Designer connects to the WSDL service. In 
the last wizard pane you’ll see a list of operations. Select the first item in the list and click 
the Finish button, as shown in Figure 33.64. Note that you may have a variety of opera-
tions from which to choose. Many services list duplicated names in the list, while others 
may have unique names for a number of different services. Browse the list box and select 
the item that suits you needs. Some will have the word “Next” grayed out– these do not 
support Doc/literal which is the supported format for LC Designer.
 
7. Drag the Data Connection to the form page. When you click Finish, you’ll see a parent 
item in the Data View palette as the data connection. Below the parent name shown in 
Figure 33.65 are several child items representing fields and buttons. To add all the items 
to your form, select the Data Connection parent item and drag it to the form page.
 
 What you see in the Data View is a set of fields for the Request. This is what you need to 
send to the Web service. You also see a set of fields for the Response. These fields will con-
tain what is returned from the Web service. You also see a button field object that contains 
the information to connect to the Web service.

8. Format the fields. Move the fields to position and edit any appearance items you want 
using the Object and Layout tabs.
 
9. Save the file. Select File ➪ Save As and save the file to disk.
 
10. Test the form. Open the form in Acrobat. Add data to the fields for the service you 
decided to use and click the button to invoke the action. Acrobat makes a data connec-
tion to the WSDL server and reports the results back in your form. In my example I used 
a currency converter. From the From Currency pull-down menu I select EUR for Euros, 
and in the To Currency pull-down menu I selected USD for US Dollars. After clicking the 
Conversion Rate Btn, the conversion rate was reported in my form by retrieving the most 
up-to-date conversion rate from the WSDL server. (See Figure 33.66.)

Learning Adobe LiveCycle Designer
If you followed all the steps in this chapter and read it over completely, you know that there’s quite 
a bit to Adobe LiveCycle Designer. I haven’t been able to go into all the detail for everything you 
can do with Designer, so there’s quite a bit more than what was covered in the previous pages in 
this chapter.
If you have a background in programming and database logic, then you may find much of the pro-
gram to be intuitive and easy to learn. If you don’t have skills in programming and understanding 
database management, then you are likely to have much difficulty getting up to speed in the pro-
gram. Some people say that Designer is easy and intuitive. I define easy as something a child or 
elderly grandparent can learn in 30 minutes time. This program doesn’t fall into that category. If 
someone tells you it’s easy to learn, don’t believe it! LiveCycle Designer is complex and tough to 
learn — especially if you’re trying to learn the program from the online guide. You won’t become a 
Designer expert by reading a single chapter in a book on Acrobat. For a good many users, what is 
needed is some sort of formal training.
If you intend to spend a good part of your workday designing interactive dynamic forms, then you 
might want to look at a framework for learning the program in detail. Here are some of my recom-
mendations for getting the most out of LiveCycle Designer:
 Practice with the program. Nothing beats practice with a software program than to dive 
in and start using it. But before you attempt to create some sophisticated forms, try to 
design static forms. Don’t jump into adding subforms and try to create dynamic forms, 
and don’t worry about database connections. The more you can become familiar with the 
different field types and setting field properties, the better off you’ll be when it comes 

1113
Using Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (Windows Only)
33
time to design more complex forms. Be sure you understand the Library palette, the 
Object palette and its Value tab, and the Border palette thoroughly. Practice so that it 
becomes very intuitive and you know exactly where you want to go to change properties 
for objects and fields. Like any other kind of learning, starting with the basics helps you 
trim some time off the learning curve.
 Attend a class. Some type of formal training is always best when working with a pro-
gram as complex as LiveCycle Designer. Search out your local community colleges, uni-
versities, and private training centers that offer classes on Designer. But be certain to 
carefully review the class content before you enroll in a class. If you see classes advertised 
as “Creating PDF Forms” or “Learning Adobe LiveCycle Designer,” make sure that the 
class instructor and the contents of the class cover creating dynamic forms. An overview 
of working with fields and creating static PDF forms isn’t going to do much more for you 
than what you can learn by yourself.
 
Some private training centers may boast about their credentialed instructors, claiming 
them to be Adobe Certified Experts in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, GoLive, Acrobat, 
Flash, and a few other programs. My guess is you won’t find anyone claiming to have all 
these certificates to know Designer in depth, at least to the level you need. Look for peo-
ple who live in the program and do some sort of professional forms design work or are 
celebrated speakers frequently talking at conferences and expos.
 
Adobe has a full-blown certification program in Designer. You can find special certified 
trainers by logging on to http://partners.adobe.com and select Training 
Providers from the “Find products and services” list on the home page.
 Get a video. This book is written in the early days of Acrobat 8, and we have yet to see if 
after-market books and videos will appear for Designer. Check regularly on the Internet 
to see if a video or DVD is released as an instructional tutorial. Videos and DVDs can 
cover much more territory in less time than reading the online guide.
 Attend a conference. One of the best ways to learn features, tips, and workarounds 
about a program is to attend a conference. There are some extra special benefits to 
attending a conference. You can attend sessions and sometimes find pre- or post-confer-
ence workshops that offer full-day courses on Designer. The added benefit is that you can 
gather some email addresses for Adobe employees, speakers, and other conference partic-
ipants. There’s probably not a more valuable asset than having someone to call when you 
really get stuck on a problem.
 Visit www.acrobatusers.com. The Acrobat Users Web site hosts many tutorials and 
articles with up-to-date information about LiveCycle Designer and Adobe Acrobat.
 Be patient. Learning Designer for the average person is like learning a foreign language. 
You have to start with basics, add continual reinforcement, and keep practicing. Don’t try 
to create complex forms too quickly. Take your time and learn a little each day. Try to 
devote some time to concepts and practice many times over so the steps in a process 
become intuitive and second nature. When you get frustrated, move away from the pro-
gram and come back the next day. Sometimes a good night’s rest can help you solve a 
problem in a matter of a few minutes that was an all-day burden the day before.

Summary
 You can access Designer from within Acrobat or by opening the program icon.
 Adobe LiveCycle Designer is a Windows-only program that ships free with Acrobat Pro 
and Acrobat Pro Extended. Macintosh users can use LiveCycle Designer on Intel Macs 
after installing a virtual desktop program, Windows XP or Windows Vista, and an 
Acrobat Pro product for Windows.
 LiveCycle Designer is a point-and-click graphical design application that simplifies cre-
ation of form templates intended to be delivered as PDF or HTML.
 LiveCycle Designer represents a new direction in form design from Adobe Systems. 
Designer provides Windows users a more sophisticated form designer environment than 
adding form fields to a PDF document in Adobe Acrobat.
 LiveCycle Designer supports the use of many different tools, commands, and an extensive 
number of palettes used to create form elements and bind data to external sources.
 You can create new form designs by starting with blank document pages, using PDF 
background artwork, converting Microsoft Word files, copying spreadsheet data, or using 
one of many preinstalled templates.
 Form elements are added to a layout from objects in the Library palette or from the Insert 
menu.
 You can create custom objects and add them to custom libraries complete with scripts 
and attribute assignments.
 Fields can be grouped in collections and added to custom libraries where they can be 
reused in subsequent forms.
 Subforms are added to a design to flow data and make the form dynamic, where fields 
and content can be assigned to flow according to user input.
 Field calculations and actions assignments are added in a Script Editor window using 
either the FormCalc or JavaScript language.
 Designer offers easy access to database connections for fields and forms.
 Designer forms can be enabled with Adobe Reader extensions in Acrobat.
 You can save designer forms as templates, PDF files, and Adobe XML form files.

I
n the last chapter, I covered creating forms using Adobe LiveCycle 
Designer. Unfortunately, Adobe Designer is one of the only features 
 covered in this book that isn’t available to Mac people. If you’re a Mac 
person, you may have felt left out while reading Chapter 33. But don’t 
despair. There are plenty of forms features still available for both Macintosh 
and Windows users in Acrobat 9.
Adobe PDF forms can be created in Acrobat Standard (Windows), Acrobat 
Pro, and Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows) using the form tools and many 
commands for creating a different kind of form. XML forms are created in 
Adobe Designer and Acrobat PDF forms are created in Acrobat (Standard, 
Pro, and Pro Extended). In some cases, an Acrobat PDF form might be pre-
ferred over an XML form. These two form types are distinctive in both the 
creation process and the intended use.
Before you delve into this chapter, realize that creating both Acrobat forms 
and Adobe LiveCycle Designer forms covers as much territory as the com-
plete Adobe Acrobat 9 PDF Bible. As a matter of fact, I’ve written a book 
titled PDF Forms Using Adobe Acrobat and LiveCycle Designer Bible (Wiley 
Publishing 2008). That book equals the size of the Adobe Acrobat 9 PDF 
Bible. Therefore, all I can hope to do in this chapter is give you a brief intro-
duction to creating PDF forms. If your primary work is creating forms, look

to other sources for a comprehensive coverage of creating forms in both Acrobat and LiveCycle 
Designer.
In this chapter, you learn how to use the new Acrobat 9 Form Editing Mode and create PDF forms 
in one of the Acrobat viewers, and find an introduction to using the different form tools. The good 
news is you can create PDF forms in Acrobat on either Windows or the Macintosh.
Setting Up the Environment
Working with PDF forms requires the use of the form tools. However, there is no form toolbar in 
Acrobat 9. Form tools are accessed when you change views from the Viewer mode to the Form 
Editing Mode. You won’t need to set up your work environment for adding form tools to the 
Acrobat Toolbar Well.
Tools such as the Select tool are used when working on forms. In addition, you have a tool for 
adding text to fill in a form without form fields called the Typewriter tool. Add the Advanced 
Editing toolbar and the Typewriter tool to the Acrobat Toolbar Well. Open a context menu on the 
Acrobat Toolbar Well and choose More Tools. Check the check boxes for Advanced Editing 
Toolbar and Typewriter Toolbar and click OK. Alternately, you can open the Tools menu and open 
the Advanced Editing Toolbar and Typewriter Toolbar from menu choices.
As a last item, return to the context menu on the Toolbar Well and select Properties Bar. When all 
toolbars are visible in the Document pane, select Dock All Toolbars from a context menu opened 
from the Toolbar Well.
After loading toolbars, your Toolbar Well should look similar to Figure 34.1.
NOTE
NOTE
In Acrobat 9 you can create PDF forms in Acrobat Standard (Windows), Acrobat Pro 
(Windows and Macintosh), and Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows). Throughout this 
chapter I refer to these viewers simply as Acrobat. When you see a reference to Acrobat in this 
chapter, realize I am talking about all three viewers.

What Are Acrobat Forms?
Forms in Acrobat are PDF files with data fields that appear as placeholders for user-supplied data. 
In Acrobat, you can use text string fields, numeric fields, check boxes, radio buttons, date fields, 
calculation fields, signature fields, and a variety of custom fields created with JavaScripts. The 
advantage of using forms in Acrobat is that doing so enables you to maintain design integrity for 
the appearance of a form while providing powerful control over data management. Rather than 
using a database manager, which may limit your ability to control fonts and graphics, Acrobat 
PDFs preserve all the design attributes of a document while behaving like a data manager.

PDF WORKFLOW
PDF WORKFLOW Forms are created in Acrobat or Adobe Designer. Form field data can be saved with 
Acrobat and also with Adobe Reader when the PDF form has been enabled with 
usage rights for Adobe Reader. When opening PDFs in Adobe Reader that have not been enabled 
with Reader Extensions, you cannot save, import, or export data. In developing PDF workflows 
for a company or organization, all users expected to design forms in Acrobat need to use one of 
the Acrobat software applications. Corporations and enterprises seeking an affordable solution 
for extending Adobe Reader to support forms features beyond the licensing limitations of Acrobat 
should look at acquiring the Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES (). For more information 
about LRES, log on to www.adobe.com/products/livecycle/readerextensions/.

See Chapter 19 for more information on enabling PDFs for filling in and saving 
forms in Adobe Reader, and also for information on licensing restrictions applied to 
the use of enabling features in Acrobat.
The non-PDF form
The one thing to keep in mind regarding Acrobat and forms is that a form in the context of PDF is 
not a paper form scanned as an image and saved as PDF. Tons of these so-called forms are around 
offices and on the Internet. These documents may have originated as forms, but by the time you 
understand all of Acrobat’s form creation features, you’ll see that these scanned documents can 
hardly be called forms. Simply put, they’re scanned images saved to PDF. The power of Acrobat 
gives you the tools to create smart forms. These forms can be dynamic, intuitive, and interactive, 
and save both you and the recipient much time in providing and gathering information.
Development of a PDF form
In Chapter 33, you learned that forms could be created in Adobe LiveCycle Designer from scratch. 
Adobe Designer has all the tools you need to create a form design starting with a blank page. 
Inasmuch as you can create a Blank New Page in Acrobat, PDF forms created in Acrobat usually 
start out as a document converted to PDF from an authoring program. Programs like Microsoft 
Office, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, or one of your favorite design programs creates the lay-
out and background for a PDF form. After the design is created in an authoring program and con-
verted to PDF, you use tools in Acrobat to add form field objects and form field attributes.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For information related to PDF creation from authoring programs, see the chapters 
in Part II.
TIP
TIP
If you create a design and then add form fields in Acrobat, and then even later 
decide to change your design, you can edit the design back in your original author-
ing application. Simply save the design and open the form you created in Acrobat. Select 
Document ➪ Replace Pages and select the modified PDF document. Replace the page and your 
modified design appears without disturbing any added form fields on the original design.

1119

Filling In PDF Forms
When you receive or download a PDF form you will encounter one of two types of forms. The so-
called PDF form that was created from a scanned document or a PDF document containing no 
form fields is one type of form. The other type of form is the PDF document containing form fields. 
In all Acrobat viewers you can populate form data in either type of form.
Using the new improved Typewriter tool
The Typewriter tool is used to fill in a form containing no form fields. You use the Typewriter tool 
like a text tool is used in other authoring programs.
 
 To use the Typewriter tool, open a document in an Acrobat viewer and click the Typewriter 
 tool. Click on the page where you want to type text and an I-beam cursor appears. Type the 
text on a line. This tool was a little clumsy in performance and took a little time to get used to in 
Acrobat 7, but the performance of the tool was much improved in Acrobat 8, and now in Acrobat 
9 you find much more control over type.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
By default, the Typewriter tool uses the Courier font. In versions of Acrobat prior 
to Acrobat and Adobe Reader 9, you could choose fonts only within the Courier 
family. Now in Acrobat 9, you can choose any font among your installed system fonts.
The tools in the Typewriter toolbar from left to right, as shown in Figure 34.2, include the 
Typewriter tool, the Text Smaller tool, the Text Larger tool, Decrease Line Spacing tool, Increase 
Line Spacing tool, Text Color, a pull-down menu listing all your installed system fonts, and a 
choice for font sizes. If you want to move a text block after typing, use the Select Object tool.
You have a number of options from a context menu you open using the Select Object tool on type 
added with the Typewriter tool. Text blocks can be aligned, centered, distributed, and sized the 
same as the options you find when managing field objects.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on using the context menu commands, see “Managing fields” 
later in this chapter.
Using the Comments panel
The Typewriter tool adds annotations to your document. The text you type with the tool is not text 
applied to the document the same as when using other options available to you for adding text. 
Each line of type you add with the Typewriter tool adds the type as an annotation, and the annota-
tions can be viewed and selected in the Comments panel. Type a few lines of text with the 
Typewriter tool and click the Comments Navigation panel button to expand the Comments panel, 
and you see a view like the one shown in Figure 34.3.

The Comments panel list of the Typewriter additions can be very handy when editing a document.

or press the Del key on your keyboard. You can also edit the type directly in the Comments panel 
and the changes are applied to the document page.

Filling in forms containing form fields
As you view the form shown in Figure 34.4, notice it contains several text fields, a few combo boxes, 
a list box, radio buttons, check boxes, and a signature field. To fill out a text field, you need to select 
the Hand tool, place the cursor over the field, and click the mouse button. When you click, a blink-
ing I-beam cursor appears, indicating that you can add text by typing on your keyboard.

TIP
To begin filling in a form, press the Tab key on your keyboard. When the Hand tool 
is selected and the cursor is not active in any field, pressing the Tab key places the 
cursor in the first field on the form.

1122
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
To navigate to the next field for more text entry, you can make one of two choices: Click in the 
next field or press the Tab key on your keyboard. When you press the Tab key, the cursor jumps 
to the next field, according to an order the PDF author specified in Acrobat when the form was 
designed. Be certain the Hand tool is selected and a cursor appears in a field box when you press 
the Tab key. If you have any other tool selected, you can tab through the fields and type data in the 
field boxes; however, if you click with the mouse when another tool is selected, you make edits 
according to the active tool.
When selecting from choices in radio button or check box fields, click in the radio button or check 
box. The display changes to show a small solid circle or check mark within a box or other kind of 
user-defined symbol from options you select for button/check box styles. When using a combo 
box, click the down-pointing arrow in the field and select from one of several pull-down menu 
choices. List boxes are scrollable fields. Scroll to the choice you want to make using the up and 
down arrows.
Form field navigation keystrokes
As mentioned in the preceding section, to move to the next field, you need to either click in the 
field or press the Tab key. Following is a list of other keystrokes that can help you move through 
forms to complete them:
 Shift+Tab. Moves to the previous field.
 Esc. Ends text entry.
 Return. Ends text entry for single line entries or adds a carriage return for multi-line fields.
 Double-click a word in a field. Selects the word.
 Ctrl/Ô+A. Selects all the text in a field.
 Left/Right Arrow keys. Moves the cursor one character at a time left or right.
 Up Arrow. Selecting options in the combo and list boxes moves up the list.
 Down Arrow. Selecting options in the combo and list boxes moves down the list.
 Up/Down Arrow with combo and list boxes selected. Moves up and down the list. 
When the list is collapsed, pressing the Down Arrow key opens the list.
 Ctrl/Ô+Tab. Accepts new entry and exits all fields. The next tab places the cursor in the 
first field.
Viewing fields
You may open a form in Acrobat where the fields are not clearly visible. Creating form fields on 
white backgrounds for fields with no border or fill color makes a field invisible when opened in an 
Acrobat viewer.
If you start to fill in a form and can’t see the form fields, click the Highlight Fields button on the 
Document message bar. All fields are highlighted with a color specified in the Forms Preferences. In 
Figure 34.5, the fields are white. When I click the Highlight Fields button in the top-right corner of 

1123

the Document message bar, the fields are highlighted, making it easy to see where each field appears 
in the form.

Part VI
Using Auto-Complete features
While filling in a form, you can enable Acrobat to record common responses you supply in form 
fields. After recording responses, each time you return to similar fields, the fields are automatically 
filled in or a list is offered to you for selecting an option for auto-completing fields.
To turn the recording mechanism on, you need to address the Forms preference settings. Open the 
Preferences dialog box by pressing Ctrl/Ô+K and select Forms in the left pane. In the right-hand 
pane, open the pull-down menu under the Auto-Complete section of the Forms preferences. You 
can make menu choices from Off, Basic, and Advanced, as shown in Figure 34.7. Selecting Off 
turns the Auto-Complete feature off. Selecting Basic stores information entered in fields and uses 
the entries to make relevant suggestions. Select Advanced from the pull-down menu to receive 
 suggestions from the stored list as you tab into a field. If a probability matches the list, using the 
Advanced option automatically fills in the field when you tab into it.
 FIGURE 34.7
Click on Forms in the Preferences dialog box and select Basic or Advanced from the Auto-Complete pull-
down menu to use the auto-completion feature.
By default, numeric data are eliminated from the data stored for the suggestions. If you want to 
include numeric data for telephone numbers, addresses, and the like, check the Remember numer-
ical data check box.
The list grows as you complete forms when either the Basic or Advanced choice is enabled in the 
pull-down menu. You can examine the list of stored entries by clicking the Edit Entry List button; 
the Auto-Complete Entry List dialog box opens as shown in Figure 34.8. To remove an item from 
the list, select it and click the Remove button. To remove all entries, click the Remove All button.
In order to record entries, you need to first make the selection for using either the Basic or 
Advanced Auto-Complete feature. To have suggestions for entries submitted as you type in fields, 
one of the two menu options needs to be enabled. When you select Off in the pull-down menu, 
both recording entered data and offering suggestions is turned off.
After selecting either Basic or Advanced in the Forms preferences and editing entries, fill out a 
form. If you recorded data after filling out one form, the next time you fill out another form you’ll 
see suggestions, as shown in Figure 34.9. The cursor appears just below City and the suggestion 
(Fairways) is derived from recorded data supplied on another form.

How good is the Auto-Compete feature in Acrobat? When the feature was first introduced several 
generations ago, it was pretty clumsy. There wasn’t much sophistication in controlling what data 
were recorded and what data were suggested when filling in a form. After several Acrobat revi-
sions, there remain no changes in the Auto-Fill feature. It’s still quite clumsy, and you’ll find some-
times it may work well for you and in other cases, you’ll find turning off the Auto-Fill option less 
distractive when completing a form.
Working in the Form Editing Environment
Up to this point I’ve covered filling in PDF forms as you might do in Adobe Reader or Adobe 
Acrobat. Let’s shift gears now and take a look at how we create a PDF form in Acrobat — remember, 
the options listed here are available to you in all the Acrobat commercial products including Acrobat 
Standard (Windows), Acrobat Pro (Windows and Macintosh), and Acrobat Pro Extended (Windows). 

1126
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
If you’re an Acrobat Standard user, there are no limitations you find when authoring forms in 
Standard. All the tools and features are identical in Acrobat Standard as they are in the Acrobat Pro 
products.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
In Acrobat 8 and versions dating back to Acrobat 3, you used form tools in the Viewer 
mode to populate a form. Beginning in Acrobat 8, you were able to use a menu com-
mand to automatically populate a form with field objects. You still have the Form Field Recognition 
command in Acrobat 9 that instructs Acrobat to search through a form and automatically add field 
objects, but authoring a form begins in the new user interface called Form Editing Mode.
To enter Form Editing Mode, you begin by selecting Forms ➪ Start Form Wizard. This menu 
 command is available to you even when you don’t have a document open in the Document pane. 
If a document is open in the Document pane, you can also choose Forms ➪ Add or Edit Fields. 
Choosing either command opens a PDF file in Form Editing Mode.
Starting the Form Wizard
When you choose Forms ➪ Start Form Wizard, the Create or Edit Form Wizard opens in Acrobat. 
Again, you can start the wizard with or without a file open in the Document pane. Figure 34.10 
shows the wizard as it appears on Windows (left) and the Macintosh (right).
 FIGURE 34.10
The Create or Edit Form Wizard provides different options for Windows and Mac users.
Windows
Macintosh
On Windows you find three options in the wizard for creating a PDF form. On the Macintosh, you 
find two options. Your options include:
 An existing electronic document (Windows)/Start with a PDF document (Macintosh). 
On Windows, you can begin with a native MS Office file, a PDF, or other file format that 
can be converted to PDF consistent with your viewer’s support for converting documents to 

1127
Understanding Acrobat Form Tools
34
PDF via the File ➪ Create PDF ➪ From File command. Acrobat performs three functions 
when you choose a file format other than PDF. Your native file is first converted to PDF, 
and Acrobat’s auto field detection operation is invoked where Acrobat automatically recog-
nizes fields on the form, and the form opens in Form Editing Mode.
 
On the Macintosh, you don’t have options for converting MS Office applications and sev-
eral other file formats. You do have a choice for converting InDesign files to PDF directly 
from within Acrobat. When you convert a PDF to a fillable form, Acrobat does two 
things. Acrobat runs auto field detection and automatically populates the form and the 
form opens in Form Editing Mode.
 A paper form (Windows/Macintosh). Choosing this option performs several steps. 
Acrobat Scan is chosen where you can scan a paper document, the Recognize Text Using 
OCR command is invoked where the scan is converted to rich text, auto field detection is 
invoked, and the form opens in Form Editing Mode.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on using Acrobat Scan and the Recognize Text Using OCR 
command, see Chapter 17.
 No existing form (Windows only). This choice opens Adobe LiveCycle Designer. Since 
Designer is available on Windows only, the choice is not available on the Macintosh.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on using Adobe LiveCycle Designer, see Chapter 33.
Adding or editing fields
Your second choice for entering Form Editing Mode is to use Forms ➪ Add or Edit Fields. This 
option is only available when you have a PDF file open in the Document pane. You can open a 
PDF file without any fields, choose the Add or Edit Fields command and Acrobat immediately 
assesses the document. If no form fields exist on the document, a dialog box opens asking you if 
you want Acrobat to detect form fields for you. If you click Yes in the dialog box, auto field detec-
tion populates the form. The form then opens in Form Editing Mode. If you click No in the dialog 
box, the form opens in Form Editing Mode where you can manually edit the form by drawing field 
objects on the page.
Changing modes
When you choose either the Start Form Wizard command or the Add or Edit Fields command from 
the Forms menu, you eventually end up in the Form Editing Mode. As you can see in Figure 34.11 
this mode is a completely different view as you have in Acrobat in what I refer to as the Viewer mode. 
In this viewer interface you find several options via buttons and menus that include:

A. Menu bar. The same menu items are listed in the menu bar as you find in the Viewer 
mode. However, very few menu items can be selected when in Form Editing Mode.
B. Select Object Tool. The Select Object tool is the default tool used in the Form Editing 
Mode. Other than the tools you select from the Add New Field menu, there is no access 
to any other tool while you remain in Form Editing Mode.
C. Add New Field. The pull-down menu offers you all the form tools that were previously 
available in earlier Acrobat toolbars. There is no separate toolbar for form tools in Acrobat 
9. The only way to manually add a field is to enter the Form Editing Mode and choose a 
tool from this menu or expand the toolbar in the Form Editing Mode Toolbar Well.
D. Preview. Click Preview and your form is shown as a recipient will see your form. In 
Preview you can add data to form fields, check tab order, calculations, and other items 
to verify the form field objects behave as you designed them. You still remain in Form 
Editing Mode when you choose this option, but the form changes from an editing view 
to a recipient view.
E. Page View Tools. Tools are available for changing zoom views and scrolling pages while 
you remain in Form Editing Mode. Note that keyboard shortcuts for zooming in and out 
of a page do not work while in Form Editing Mode.

1129
Understanding Acrobat Form Tools
34
F. Distribute Form. This button was positioned on the Form toolbar in Acrobat 8. You use 
this option for distributing a form to selected recipients.
G. Close Form Editing. Click this button to bail out of Form Editing Mode and return to 
Viewer mode. The only way to return to Form Editing Mode is to choose Forms ➪ Add or 
Edit Fields.
H. Fields panel. The Form Editing Mode is the only place you’ll find the Fields panel. You 
cannot access the panel in Viewer mode by opening the View ➪ Navigation Panels menu 
command. The Fields panel doesn’t appear as a choice in the submenu.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Be aware that you toggle views between Form Editing Mode and Viewer mode by 
clicking buttons or accessing menu commands. If you need to return to the Form 
Editing Mode from the Viewer mode, you need to choose Forms ➪ Add or Edit Fields. Acrobat 
doesn’t provide another menu command or a button to enter the mode from Viewer mode. 
When you want to return to the Viewer mode and access other menu commands or use other 
Acrobat tools, you must exit the Form Editing Mode by clicking the Close Form Editing button.
Editing according to mode
One thing to keep in mind is that Form Editing Mode is the place you want to use for applying 
fields. Most of the other kinds of editing you do with form fields can be handled in the Viewer 
mode. For example, if you create a button field and use the button for a navigational link, you 
would first enter Form Editing Mode and create your button. Once the button is created, you 
could exit Form Editing Mode and add the link options such as opening a page in another docu-
ment, opening a file, linking to a view, and so on. Although some of these actions can be assigned 
while in Form Editing Mode, some are not. Therefore you’ll frequently find adding actions and 
JavaScripts much easier while in the Viewer mode.
Table 34.1 shows a list of the kinds of edits you can make respective to Form Editing and Viewer 
modes.

Creating a PDF Form
You have three means for creating an AcroForm — that is, a form created in Acrobat. You can start 
with a form design where fields are clearly identified with design elements such as lines and boxes, 
you can scan a paper form, and you can add form field objects from scratch using the form tools. 
For the first two options, you let Acrobat automatically add field objects through auto detecting 
fields that is invoked when you enter Form Editing Mode. Using the third option assumes Acrobat 
cannot detect any fields on a form design and you need to manually add all the field objects.
Using auto field detection
In Acrobat 8 you needed to open the Forms menu and choose the Run Form Field Recognition 
menu command to let Acrobat automatically populate a form. In Acrobat 9, the command is auto-
matic when you enter the Form Editing Mode. You can choose to automatically run the command 
or bypass it if you want to manually add field objects.
You also have a choice for how you want to open your form design. If you have an original design 
in a program like MS Word on Windows, you can choose to open the original Word document in 
Acrobat. Acrobat will convert your Word document to a PDF file, open the Form Editing Mode, 
and use the Form Field Recognition action. It’s all accomplished in one step, making conversion of 
files like MS Word, Adobe InDesign, and a host of other file formats to PDF forms a super-easy 
task.
Let’s take a minute to see how easy it is to convert a Microsoft Office document to a PDF form by 
following these steps:

Steps: Converting a document to a PDF form
 
1. Start the Form Wizard. Choose Forms ➪ Start Form Wizard to open the Create or Edit 
Form wizard shown earlier in Figure 34.10. Using this command presumes you have a 
form design saved from a Microsoft Office application or other file format compatible 
with creating a PDF from within Acrobat (Windows).
 
 If you’re a Mac user, you need to begin with a PDF document. If you have an Office file, 
convert the file to PDF before using the Form Wizard.
 
2. Select the file to convert. In the Create or Edit Form wizard click the Next button and 
click Browse to locate a file. Locate a file and click Next. Acrobat will convert the file, 
open the document in Form Editing Mode, and use auto field detection.
 
 Mac users can select a PDF document in the Create or Edit Form wizard and the PDF 
document opens in Form Editing Mode and auto field detection is automatically invoked.
 
3. Review the Welcome to Form Editing Mode welcome dialog box. When you enter 
Form Editing Mode and Acrobat automatically detects field objects, a welcome dialog box 
opens as shown in Figure 34.12. This dialog box offers some information about creating 
form field objects in Form Editing Mode. Look over the information and click OK. After 
you become familiar with creating forms in Acrobat, you can click the Don’t show again 
check box to prevent the dialog box from opening in future form-editing sessions.
 FIGURE 34.12
Look over the information in the Welcome to Form Editing dialog box and click OK.

4. Review the form. After auto detecting fields on your form, you should always look over 
the form to be certain all fields were properly added. Although auto detection does a 
great job in adding fields to a form, it’s not perfect and you can often find a little polish is 
needed to finalize the form. In my example, I have a few problems on my form.
 
 Two extra fields were added to the form where form field objects shouldn’t appear as 
shown in Figure 34.13. These fields need to be deleted. The first row of boxes is check 
box fields that should be radio buttons designed as mutually exclusive fields. As one but-
ton is checked, the others should remain unchecked. The second row of fields is radio 
buttons, but they are not designed as mutually exclusive fields.
 FIGURE 34.13
Examine the form.
Radio buttons need reworking
Extra fields
 
5. Delete unnecessary fields. Locate any fields that were created and not needed on your 
form. Click a field and press the Del or Backspace key to remove a field object. If you 
intend to redesign radio buttons or check boxes, delete all the buttons/check boxes in a 
row by dragging through the objects and pressing the Del or Backspace key.

6. Add radio button fields. Open the Add New Field pull-down menu and select the Radio 
Button tool. Move the tool to the location on the form where you want to add a radio 
button and click the mouse to drop the field on the page.
 
7. Name the field and set the button value. A mini properties box opens when you add a 
field to a page. You can type a name for the field and set a button value when adding 
radio buttons to a form. In Figure 34.14 I name my new radio button field seminarDate 
and I set the button value to May 1.
 FIGURE 34.14
Name the field and add a button value.
 
8. Add a new field. Click Add another button to group and the cursor changes to a 
crosshair. Click or click+drag to place another button field on the page. By default, 
your field name remains the same. Just type another Button Value for the field. By adding 
buttons (or check boxes) with the same name and changing the values, you create a 
mutually exclusive set of radio buttons (or check boxes).
 
9. Preview the form. Click Preview and add data to all your field objects. Be certain the 
fields are designed properly and the data you add to the form conforms properly to your 
form design.
 
10. Save the form. Choose File ➪ Save As and rewrite the file. If you save periodically, 
rewriting the file reduces the final file size.
TIP
TIP
While working on a form you may need to zoom in and scroll the screen to display 
hidden areas of your form. While in Form Editing Mode you don’t have a Hand tool 
to scroll the window. To gain temporary access to the Hand tool, press the Spacebar and drag 
the screen to display hidden areas.
TIP
TIP
You may notice that Acrobat successfully creates check boxes and radio buttons on 
some forms you open in Form Editing Mode, and none of these kinds of fields are 
created on other forms. The reason is easily explained. If you use a text character in an authoring 
program such as a Wingding font to create a box, Acrobat interprets the character as text and 
won’t create a radio button or check box. If you draw a rectangle or square using a drawing tool, 
Acrobat always creates a radio button or check box. Be certain to avoid using fonts where you 
want these field types to appear on a form.

Preparing Files for Auto Field Detection
A
crobat’s auto field detection does a very good job of recognizing form fields on simple forms. 
However, when forms become more complex and when you create forms with graphics, gradi-
ents, and complex design elements, auto field detection falls apart and won’t create fields on most 
graphically intense form designs. For example, take a look at the figure below. When I enter Form 
Editing Mode and Form Field Recognition is run, no fields are recognized on the form.
If you use programs like Adobe Illustrator or Adobe InDesign to create forms with complex graphic 
elements, you can prepare your files for using auto field detection by adding an extra layer that you 
use just for the detecting fields. Using programs like Illustrator or InDesign provide you the benefit 
for using layers in your design. You can easily create a background with all the graphic elements, a 
text layer containing all the text in the form, a layer for fields used in the final design, and a separate 
layer for temporary fields designed for auto detecting fields in Acrobat. An example of such a form I 
created in Adobe Illustrator is shown below.

1135

Scanning paper forms
Converting paper forms to electronic forms is performed by first using Acrobat Scan to scan a doc-
ument into a PDF file. When you open the Create or Edit Form wizard and click the A paper form 
radio button and then click Next, the Acrobat Scan dialog box opens as shown in Figure 34.15.
 FIGURE 34.15
Choose A paper form option in the Create or Edit Form wizard and the Acrobat Scan dialog box opens.
The first step in converting a paper document is to scan it using Acrobat Scan. The choices you 
have for scanning from within Acrobat via Acrobat Scan are all covered in Chapter 17. Look over 
that chapter if you want more information on scanning in Acrobat.
If you do use Acrobat Scan to convert a paper form to PDF, Acrobat automatically runs the internal 
OCR feature and converts the scan to rich text. From there, the file opens in Form Editing Mode 
and fields are automatically added via auto field detection.
If you create a similar form in a program like Adobe Illustrator or Adobe InDesign, save your file to 
PDF as a PDF version 1.5 or greater document (Acrobat 6 and above compatibility) and check 
options for creating Adobe PDF Layers. You must save the file that appears with Layers in Acrobat. 
(See Chapter 24 for more on PDFs and layers.) In Acrobat you can view just the Text and Temp 
Fields layers, all layers, or any combination of layers. Acrobat won’t complain and the auto field 
detection creates form fields from the Temp Fields layer whether it is visible or not.
You may need to add a little polish on the form for sizing some field boxes, adding/deleting some 
fields, and adding the radio button and check box fields, but the little time it takes to create a tem-
porary layer in an authoring application is a fraction of the time you would need to spend in Acrobat 
to manually create all the text fields. By using an authoring application supporting layers, you can 
easily create a PDF file that is Form Field Recognition–friendly. Planning ahead when designing 
forms in authoring programs can save you much time when using the auto field detection.
To finish up a form design in Acrobat, you can flatten the layers. Be certain to turn off all layers you 
want discarded, and when you select Flatten Layers from the Layers panel Options menu the hidden 
layers are discarded and the PDF is flattened. All field objects remain undisturbed regardless of what 
layer views you have on or off.

1136
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
You have the same issues to deal with converting a paper form to PDF as you do when converting 
a file to PDF in regard to the field objects. Look over the form while in Form Editing Mode and 
delete any unwanted fields. Be sure to double-check the form to see if all fields have been added, 
and check the radio buttons and check boxes for mutually exclusive fields. Like other forms you 
create in Acrobat, it’s a good idea to check the fields in Preview mode to be certain all fields are 
formatted properly.
Manually creating field objects
Forms contain different types of data fields that hold data, act as buttons that invoke actions, and 
call scripts to execute a series of actions. Form fields can assume different appearances as well as 
possess the capability to include graphic icons and images to represent hot links that invoke 
actions. Acrobat forms are more than a static data filing system — they can be as vivid and 
dynamic as your imagination.
In Acrobat, the form data fields are created by making selections from the Add New Field pull-
down menu in Form Editing Mode. Making a menu choice loads the cursor with a tool you use to 
either click on the form where a field is to be placed at a default size or click and drag the cursor 
to create a custom size.
For an overview of the field types, look over the following list:
 Button. A button is usually used to invoke an action or hyperlink. A button face can be 
text or a graphic element created in another program that you could apply as an appear-
ance to the button. You can also use different appearance settings in the button properties 
for adding stroke and fill colors. Buttons are also used to import images.
 Check Box. Check boxes typically appear in groups to offer the user a selection of 
choices. Yes and no items or a group of check boxes might be created for multiple-choice 
selections.
 Combo Box. When you view an Acrobat form, you may see a down-pointing arrow simi-
lar to the arrows appearing in panel menus. Such an arrow in a PDF form indicates the 
presence of a combo box. When you click the arrow, a pull-down menu opens with a list 
of choices. Users are limited to selecting a single choice from combo boxes. Additionally, 
if designed as such, users can input their own choices.
 List Box. A list box displays a box with scroll bars, much like windows you see in appli-
cation software documents. As you scroll through a list box, you make a choice of one or 
more of the alternatives available by selecting items in the list.
 Radio Button. Radio buttons perform the same function in PDF forms as radio buttons 
do in dialog boxes. Usually you have two or more choices for a category. Forms are usu-
ally designed with radio buttons offering mutually exclusive choices so that when one 
radio button in a group is turned on, the other buttons in the group are turned off.

1137
Understanding Acrobat Form Tools
34
 Text Field. Text fields are boxes in which the end user types text to fill out the form. 
Text fields can contain alphabetical characters, numbers, or a combination of both.
 Digital Signature. Digital signatures can be applied to fields, PDF pages, and PDF docu-
ments. A digital signature can be used to lock out fields on a form.
 Barcode. The Barcode tool is not a completely new feature in Acrobat 8. Acrobat 7 sup-
ported a plug-in to create 2D and 3D barcodes that was shipped long after the initial 
release of Acrobat 7.0. Now with Acrobat 8.0, you get the Barcode tool appearing in the 
Forms toolbar. This tool provides you options for adding barcodes to a PDF form.
All these form field types and tools are available to you in Form Editing Mode from the Add New 
Field pull-down menu. In almost all editing sessions you’ll find a need to manually add a field to a 
form. If using Form Field Recognition, you may add only a few form objects. If you manually cre-
ate fields on a form, you’ll find frequent uses for all the form tools you select from the Add New 
Field menu.
Assigning Form Field Properties
Field Properties provide you a number of options for setting field attributes for all the form field 
types. There are a number of common properties that all fields share such as field names, appear-
ances, and actions choices, and there are a number of properties that are unique among the various 
field types.
In Acrobat 9 you have two different properties environments. When in Form Editing Mode you 
add a new field to a document, an abbreviated properties wizard helps you identify essential prop-
erties for new fields added to a form. For all field types other than radio buttons, your properties 
choices are limited to typing a name for the new field. With radio buttons you have an additional 
choice for adding fields to a group.
When in Form Editing Mode or Viewer mode, you can open a context menu on a field and choose 
Properties. This choice provides you with a much more expanded version of properties choices. In 
the Properties dialog box, you choose options from several different panes. Depending on the field 
type you create, the panes in the Properties dialog box vary for different field types. Some field 
properties are common among several fields, while other properties are unique to each field type.
To open the Properties dialog box, click a field in Form Editing Mode or use the Select Object tool 
in Viewer mode and click a field. Open a context menu and choose Properties. If opening the 
Properties on a text field, the Text Field Properties dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 34.16.

When creating fields in Form Editing Mode, click Show All Properties in the abbre-
viated properties window to open the expanded properties dialog box.

 FIGURE 34.16
When you open the Properties dialog box on a text field, the General field properties appear as the default.
General properties
The General properties tab is the default tab where general properties are assigned. These proper-
ties are common to all field types. The properties include:
 Name. By default, Acrobat adds a name in the Name field. As a matter of practice you 
should type a descriptive name in the Name text box. Don’t use names with spaces, and 
try to use parent/child names for fields in common groups. A parent/child name might 
appear as item.1, item.2, item.3 and so on; or you might have client.first, client.last, 
 client.address, and so on.
 Tooltip. Type a name and when the cursor is placed over the field in Preview mode, the 
text appears as a tooltip below the Hand tool cursor.
 Form Field. From the pull-down menu, make choices for visibility and printing. By 
default, the field is visible and prints when the file is printed.
 Orientation. A field and a field’s contents can be rotated in 90-degree rotations. By 
default, fields are at a 0 (zero)-degree rotation. Select from 90, 180, and 270 to rotate 
fields in fixed rotations.
 Read Only. When a field is marked as Read Only, the field is not editable. The user is 
locked out of the field. A Read Only field might be something you use to show fixed price 
costs where you don’t want users changing a fixed purchase price on an order form. 
Another example is a value that is pre-populated from a database or with fields that show 
results of other calculated data.
 Required. If a field needs to be filled in before the data is submitted, select the 
Required box.

1139

34
 Locked. Locking a field prevents the field from being moved. You can still type data in 
the field or make a choice from options for other fields. This item is used to fix fields in 
position as you edit a form.
Appearance properties
The Appearance tab relates to form field appearances. The rectangles you draw can be assigned 
border colors and content fills. The text added to a field box or default text you use for a field 
can be assigned different fonts, font sizes, and font colors. These options exist in the Appearance 
properties for all field types except barcode fields (barcode fields don’t have an Appearance tab). 
Figure 34.17 shows the Appearance properties for a selected text field.
 FIGURE 34.17
Click the Appearance tab for any field properties and make choices for the appearance of fields and text.
The Appearance options include the following:
 Border Color. The keyline created for a field is made visible with a rectangular border 
assigned by clicking the Border Color swatch and choosing a color.
 Background Color. The field box can be assigned a background color. If you want the 
field box displayed in a color, enable this option, click the color swatch next to it, and 
choose a color the same way you do for the borders. When the check box is disabled, 
the background appears transparent.
 Line Thickness. Options are the same as those available for link rectangles. Select the 
pull-down menu and choose from Thin, Medium, or Thick. The pull-down menu is 
grayed out unless you first select a Border Color.

1140
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 Line Style. You can choose from five style types from the pull-down menu. The Solid 
option shows the border as a keyline at the width specified in the Width setting. Dashed 
shows a dashed line; Beveled appears as a box with a beveled edge; Inset makes the field 
look recessed; and Underline eliminates the keyline and shows an underline for the text 
across the width of the field box. See Figure 34.18 for an example of these style types.
 Font Size. Depending on the size of the form fields you create, you may have a need to 
choose a different point size for the text. The default is Auto, which automatically adjusts 
point sizes according to the height of the field box. Choices are available for manually set-
ting the point size for text ranges between 2 and 300 points.
 FIGURE 34.18
Five choices for a border style are available in the Appearance tab when selecting from 
the Line Style pull-down menu.
 Text Color. If you identify a color for text by selecting the swatch adjacent to Text Color, 
the field contents the end user supplies change to the selected color.
 Font. From the pull-down menu, select a font for the field data. All the fonts installed in 
your system are accessible from the pull-down menu. When designing forms for screen 
displays, try to use sans serif fonts for better screen views.
The Appearance settings are identical for all field types except Digital Signature fields, Radio 
Button fields, Check Box fields, and Barcode fields. The Radio Button and Check Box fields use 
fixed fonts for displaying characters in the field box. You choose what characters to use in the 
Options tab. When creating Radio Button and Check Box fields, you don’t have a choice for Font 
in the Appearance properties. By default, the Adobe Pi font is used.
Options properties
The Options tab provides selections for specific attributes according to the type of fields you add to a 
page. Options are available for all fields except the Digital Signatures field. Options tab attributes for 
the other six field types include options for text, radio buttons, combo and list boxes, and buttons.

Text options
When you use the Text Field tool to create a field and you click on the Options tab, the Properties 
window appears, as shown in Figure 34.19.
 FIGURE 34.19
The Options settings in the Text Field Properties dialog box
Each of the following attribute settings is optional when creating text fields:
 Alignment. The Alignment pull-down menu has two functions. First, any text entered in 
the Default field is aligned according to the option you specify from the pull-down menu 
choices. Alignment choices include Left, Center, and Right. Second, regardless of whether 
text is used in the Default field, when the end user fills out the form the cursor is posi-
tioned at the alignment selected from the pull-down menu choices. Therefore, if you 
select Center from the Alignment options, the text entered when filling out the form is 
centered within the field box.
 Default Value. The Default Value field can be left blank, or you can enter text that 
appears in the field when viewing the form. The Default item has nothing to do with the 
name of the field. This option is used to provide helpful information when the user fills 
out the form data. If no text is entered in the Default field, when you return to the form, 
the field appears empty. If you enter text in the Default field, the text you enter appears 
inside the field box and can be deleted, edited, or replaced.

1142
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 Multi-line. If your text field contains more than one line of text, select the Multi-line 
option. When you press the Return key after entering a line of text, the cursor jumps to 
the second line where additional text is added to the same field. Multi-line text fields 
might be used, for example, as an address field to accommodate a second address line.
 Scrolling long text. If Multi-line is selected and text entries exceed the height of the 
field, you may want to add scroll bars to the field. Enable the check box to permit users 
to scroll lines of text. If the check box is disabled, users won’t be able to scroll, but as text 
is added, automatic scrolling accommodates the amount of text typed in the field.
 Allow Rich Text Formatting. When you check this box, users can style text with bold, 
italic, and bold italic font styles. You may want to enable the check box if you want users 
to emphasize a field’s contents.
 Limit of [ ] characters. The box for this option provides for user character limits for a 
given field. If you want the user to add a state value of two characters, for example, check 
the box and type 2 in the field box. If the user attempts to go beyond the limit, a system 
warning beep alerts the user that no more text can be added to the field.
 Password. When this option is enabled, all the text entered in the field appears as a 
series of asterisks when the user fills in the form. The field is not secure in the sense that 
you must have a given password to complete the form; it merely protects the data entry 
from being seen by an onlooker.
 Field is used for file selection. This option permits you to specify a file path as part of 
the field’s value. The file is submitted along with the form data. Be certain to enable the 
Scrolling long text option described earlier in this list to enable this option.
 Check spelling. Spell checking is available for comments and form fields. When the 
check box is enabled, the field is included in a spell check. This can be helpful so the 
spell-checker doesn’t get caught up with stopping at proper names, unique identifiers, 
and abbreviations that may be included in those fields.
 Comb of [ ] characters. When you create a text field box and enable this check box, Acrobat 
automatically creates a text field box with preset spacing according to the value you supply in 
the Characters field box. For example, if you set the value of the characters to 7, the spacing 
between the characters when data is added to the form spaces the characters equidistant to fit 
seven characters for the field size. Setting a lower value adds more space between characters, 
and adding higher values reduces space between characters. In Figure 34.20 you can see a 
comb field designed for seven characters. Be certain to disable all other check boxes. You can 
set the alignment of the characters by making a choice from the alignment pull-down menu, 
but all other check boxes need to be disabled to access the Comb of check box.
NOTE
NOTE
Comb fields are limited to single characters. If you need to create comb fields 
where two characters are contained in each subdivision, you need to create sepa-
rate field boxes for each pair of characters.
TIP
TIP
When you create a new form and use auto field detection, Acrobat can pick up 
comb fields and format them properly. Be certain to carefully design comb fields 
with hatch marks spaced the same height and distance in your authoring program and you’ll find 
Acrobat doing a good job in formatting the fields as comb fields. If hatch mark line widths, dis-
tances, or sizes vary, Acrobat won’t recognize the fields as comb fields.

Check box and radio button options
Check boxes and radio buttons have similar Options attribute choices. When you select either field 
and click on the Options tab, the settings common to both field types include:
 Button/Check Box Style. If a radio button is selected, the title is Button Style as shown 
in Figure 34.21. If the field is a check box, the title is listed as Check Box Style. From the 
pull-down menu, you select the style you want to use for the check mark inside the radio 
button or check box field.
 FIGURE 34.21
You can choose various options for radio buttons and check boxes, including those for 
the style of the check marks or radio buttons.

1144
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 Button/Export Value. When creating either a check box or radio button, use the same 
field name for all fields in a common group where you want one radio button/check box 
enabled while all the other radio buttons/check boxes are disabled. To distinguish the 
fields from each other, add a Button Style (radio buttons) Export Value (check boxes) 
that differs in each field box. You can use export values such as Yes and No or other text, 
or number values such as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.
 
The creation of radio buttons and check boxes on Acrobat forms has been confusing to 
many users, and users often inappropriately create workarounds for check boxes and 
radio buttons to toggle them on and off. To help eliminate confusion, notice the Options 
properties in Figure 34.21 include a help message informing you to name fields the same 
name but use different export values.
 Button/Check box is checked by default. If you want a default value to be applied for 
either field type (for example, Yes), enter the export value and select the box to make the 
value the default. One distinction appears in the Options dialog box between radio but-
tons and check boxes. The second check box in the radio button properties is unique to 
radio buttons.
 Buttons with the same name and value are selected in unison (applies to radio but-
tons only). For data export purposes, you’ll want to add a different button/export value 
for each radio button and check box. If you don’t need to export data to a database with 
unique export values for each radio button, you can add radio buttons to a page with the 
same export values and, by default, when a user clicks one radio button all other radio 
buttons are disabled. If you want all radio buttons to be selected when clicking one but-
ton in a group having the same name and export value, check this check box.
The Button/Check Box Style selection from the pull-down menu in both field types provides iden-
tical appearances. The styles are shown in Figure 34.22.
 FIGURE 34.22
Six icon options are available for check boxes and radio buttons.

Combo box and list box options
Combo boxes enable you to create form fields with a list of selections appearing in a pull-down 
window. The user completing a form makes a selection from the menu items. If all items are not 
visible, the menu contains scroll bars made visible after selecting the down-pointing arrow to open 
the menu. A list box is designed as a scrollable window with an elevator bar and arrows as you see 
in authoring application documents, as shown in Figure 34.23.
 FIGURE 34.23
View the combo box items by clicking the down arrow. After you open the menu, the scroll bars become 
visible. List boxes enable users to select multiple items in the scrollable window.
The two field types differ in several ways. First, combo boxes require less space for the form field. 
The combo box menu drops down from a narrow field height where the menu options are shown. 
List boxes require more height to make them functional to the point where at least two or three 
options are in view before the user attempts to scroll the window. Second, you can select only one 
menu option from a combo box. List boxes enable users to select multiple items. Finally, combo 
boxes can be designed for users to add text for a custom choice by editing any of the menu items. 
List boxes provide no option for users to type text in the field box, and the menu items are not 
editable.
The data exported with the file include the selected item from the combo boxes and all selected 
items for list boxes. The item choices and menu designs for the field types are created in the 
Options tab for the respective field type. Attributes for list boxes, shown in Figure 34.24, are also 
available for combo boxes.

1146

 FIGURE 34.24
The Options settings for list boxes have common properties also found in combo boxes.
The options include:
 Item. You enter the name of an entry you want to appear in the scrollable list in this field.
 Export Value. When the data are exported, the name you enter in this field box is the 
exported value. If the field is left blank, the exported value is the name used in the item 
description typed in the Item field. If you want different export values than the name 
descriptions, type a value in this field box. As an example, suppose you created a con-
sumer satisfaction survey form. In that form, the user can choose from list items such as 
Very Satisfied, Satisfied, and Unsatisfied, and you’ve specified the export values for these 
items to be 1, 2, and 3, respectively. When the data are analyzed, the frequency of the 
three items would be tabulated and defined in a legend as 1=Very Satisfied, 2=Satisfied, 
and 3=Unsatisfied.
 Add. After you enter the Item and Export Values, click the Add button to place the item 
in the Item List. After adding an item, you can return to the Item field and type a new 
item in the field box and, in turn, a new export value.

1147

 Item List. As you add items, the items appear in a scrollable list window. To edit a name 
in the list window, delete the item, type a new name in the Item text box, and then click 
the Add button to add the newly edited item back in the list.
 Delete. If an item has been added to the list and you want to delete it, first select the item 
in the list. Click the Delete button to remove it from the list.
 Up/Down. Items are placed in the list according to the order in which they are entered. 
The order displayed in the list is shown in the combo box or list box when you return to 
the document page. If you want to reorganize items, select the item in the list and click 
the Up or Down button to move one level up or down, respectively. To enable the Up 
and Down buttons, the Sort Items option must be disabled.
 Sort items. When checked, the list is alphabetically sorted in ascending order. As new 
items are added to the list, the new fields are dynamically sorted while the option is 
enabled.
 Multiple selection (List box only). Any number of options can be selected by using 
modifier keys and clicking on the list items. Use Shift+click for contiguous selections and 
Ctrl/Ô+click for noncontiguous selections. This option applies only to list boxes.
 Commit selected value immediately. The choice made in the field box is saved imme-
diately. If the check box is disabled, the choice is saved after the user exits the field by 
tabbing out or clicking the mouse cursor on another field or outside the field.
With the exception of the multiple selection item, the preceding options are also available for 
combo boxes. In addition to these options, combo boxes offer two more items that include:
 Allow user to enter custom text. The items listed in the Options tab are fixed in the 
combo box on the Acrobat form by default. If this check box is enabled, the user can cre-
ate a custom value. Acrobat makes no provision for some items to be edited, and others 
are locked out from editing.
 Check spelling. Spell-checking is performed when a user types in a custom value. As 
text is typed the spelling is checked.
Button options
Buttons differ from all other fields when it comes to appearance. You can create and use custom 
icons for button displays from PDF documents or file types compatible with Convert to PDF from 
File. Rather than entering data or toggling a data field, buttons typically execute an action. You 
might use a button to clear a form, export data, import data from a data file, or use buttons as navi-
gation links. When you add a button to a page, the Options tab attributes change to those shown 
in Figure 34.25.

Part VI
 FIGURE 34.25
The Options tab for the Button field properties includes options for button face displays and several differ-
ent mouse behaviors.
When you create a button, you make choices from the Options tab for the highlight view of the 
button, the behavior of the mouse cursor, and the text and icon views. The Options attributes for 
buttons are as follows:
 Layout. Several views are available for displaying a button with or without a label, which 
you add in the Label field described later in this list. The choices from the pull-down 
menu for Layout offer options for displaying a button icon with text appearing at the top, 
bottom, left, or right side of the icon, or over the icon. Figure 34.26 shows the different 
Layout options.
 Behavior. The Behavior options affect the appearance of the button when the button is 
clicked. The None option specifies no highlight when the button is clicked. Invert 
momentarily inverts the colors of the button when clicked. Outline displays a keyline 
border around the button, and Push makes the button appear to move in on Mouse 
Down and out on Mouse Up.
 Icon and Label State. Three choices are available in the list when you select Push in the 
Behavior pull-down menu. Up displays the highlight action when the mouse button is 
released. Down displays the highlight action when the mouse button is pressed. Rollover 
changes the icon when a second icon has been added to the rollover option. When the 
user moves the mouse cursor over the button without clicking, the image changes to the 
second icon you choose — much like a rollover effect you see on Web pages.
 Label. If you’ve selected a layout type that includes a label, type text in the field box for 
the label you want to use. Labels are shown when one of the options for the layout 
includes a label view with or without the icon.

1149

 FIGURE 34.26
The Layout options include Label only; Icon only; Icon top, label bottom; Label top, 
icon bottom; Icon left, label right; Label left, icon right; and Label over icon.
 Choose Icon. When you use an icon for a button display, click Choose Icon to open the 
Select Icon dialog box. In the Select Icon dialog box, use a Browse button to open a naviga-
tion dialog box where you locate a file to select for the button face. The file can be a PDF 
document or a file compatible with converting to PDF from within Acrobat. The size of the 
file can be as small as the actual icon size or a letter-size page or larger. Acrobat automati-
cally scales the image to fit within the form field rectangle drawn with the Button tool. 
When you select an icon, it is displayed as a thumbnail in the Select Icon dialog box.
TIP
TIP
An icon library can be easily created from drawings using a font such as Zapf 
Dingbats or Wingdings or patterns and drawings from an illustration program. 
Create or place images on several pages in a layout application. Distill the file to save out as a 
multiple-page PDF document. When you select an icon to use for a button face, the Select Icon 
dialog box enables you to scroll pages in the document. You view each icon in the Sample win-
dow as a thumbnail of the currently selected page. When the desired icon is in view, click OK. 
The respective page is used as the icon.
 Clear. You can eliminate a selected icon by clicking the Clear button. Clear eliminates 
the icon without affecting any text you added in the Layout field box.
 Advanced. Notice the Advanced button at the top of the Options tab. Clicking the 
Advanced button opens the Icon Placement dialog box where you select attributes related 
to scaling an icon. You can choose from icon scaling for Always, Never, Icon is Too Big, 
Icon is Too Small to fit in the form field. The Scale option offers choices between 
Proportional and Non-proportional scaling. Click Fit to bounds to ensure the icon place-
ment fits to the bounds of the field rectangle. Sliders provide a visual scaling reference for 
positioning the icon within a field rectangle.

Barcode options
Barcode fields have unique options designed to work with barcode scanners. You have options 
from pull-down menus and pop-up dialog boxes opened from buttons, as shown in Figure 34.27. 
In order to make choices for the items in the Options pane in the Barcode Field Properties dialog 
box, you need to know what parameters are used by your barcode scanner, fax server, or docu-
ment scanner. Setting the options requires reviewing the documentation supplied by the hardware 
used to scan barcodes.
 FIGURE 34.27
The Options tab for barcodes requires setting options conforming to the tools you use to scan barcodes.
Barcodes need to calculate the data in the form in order to form the barcode. When you create bar-
code fields, the fields should be created with sample data on a form in order for the barcode to 
perform the necessary calculation to form the bar code image. You’ll find at times that the barcode 
field isn’t large enough to accommodate all data. If this occurs, you need to make the field larger or 
eliminate some data from the barcode.

Managing the data is handled in the Value tab. See the section “Barcode proper-
ties” later in this chapter.

Actions properties
The Actions tab enables you to set an action for any one of the eight field types; the attribute 
choices are identical for all fields. The same action items available for links, bookmarks, and page 
actions are also available to form fields. Click the Actions tab and the pane changes, as shown in 
Figure 34.28.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on selecting action types, see Chapter 22.
From the Select Trigger pull-down menu, you make choices for different mouse behaviors that are 
assigned to invoke the action. From the menu options you have choices for:
 Mouse Up. When the user releases the mouse button, the action is invoked.
 Mouse Down. When the user presses the mouse button, the action is invoked.
 Mouse Enter. When the user moves the mouse cursor over the field, the action is invoked.
 Mouse Exit. When the user moves the mouse cursor away from the field, the action is 
invoked.
 On Focus. Specifies moving into the field boundaries through mouse movement or by 
tabbing to the field. As the cursor enters the field, the action is invoked.
 On Blur. Specifies moving away from the field boundaries through mouse movement or 
by tabbing to the field. As the cursor exits the field, the action is invoked.
Actions assigned to the cursor movements are similar to those in the context of creating links. You 
first select the trigger, and then select an action type from the Select Action pull-down menu. Click 
the Add button to add the action to the Actions list.
The action is assigned to the mouse cursor option when you click Add. The default is Mouse Up. 
When Mouse Up is selected, the action is invoked when the mouse button is released.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
Trigger choices other than Mouse Up may sometimes complicate filling in form 
fields for end users. Just about any program dealing with link buttons has adopted 
the Mouse Up response to invoke an action. Many users often click down, think about what they 
are doing, and then move the mouse away without releasing the button. This behavior enables 
the user to change his/her mind at the last minute. Deviating from the adopted standard might 
be annoying for a user.
When you click the Add button, a dialog box specific to the action type you are adding opens. The 
actions listed in this dialog box are the same as those in the Link Properties dialog box discussed in 
Chapter 22. Turn back to Chapter 22 for examples of how the following action types work. A few 
of the more important action types used with form fields include importing form data, resetting a 
form, submitting a form, and showing and hiding a field.

1152
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 FIGURE 34.28
Actions are available for all field types.
Importing form data
You can export the raw data from a PDF file as a Form Data File (FDF), XFDF, XML, or TXT that 
can later be imported into other PDF forms. To import data, you use a menu command from the 
list of action types (Import Form Data) or create a JavaScript. Rather than retyping the data in each 
form, you can import the same field data into new forms where the field names match exactly. 
Therefore, if a form contains field names such as First, Last, Address, City, State, and so on, all 
common field names from the exported data can be imported into the current form. Acrobat 
ignores those field names without exact matches.
NOTE
NOTE
In earlier versions of Acrobat, you also had an option to Execute a menu item that 
appears in the Select Action pull-down menu. From the menu items you could 
select Import (or Export) Data. In Acrobat 8 and 9, the Execute a menu item options have been 
greatly reduced and you can no longer manage data using this action type. For more information 
on the items available with the Execute a menu item action type, see Chapter 22.
PDF WORKFLOW
PDF WORKFLOW The Import Data command (Forms ➪ Manage Form Data ➪ Import Data) enables you 
to develop forms for an office environment or Web server where the same data can 
easily be included in several documents. When designing forms, using the same field names for 
all common data is essential. If you import data and some fields remain blank, recheck your field 
names. You can edit any part of a form design or action to correct errors.

1153
Understanding Acrobat Form Tools
34
Resetting a form
This action is handy for forms that need to be cleared of data and resubmitted. When the Reset a 
form action is invoked, data fields specified for clearing data when the field was added are cleared. 
When you select Reset a form and click the Add button, the Reset a Form dialog box opens. You 
make choices in this dialog box for what fields you want to clear. Click the Select All button and 
all data fields are cleared when a user clicks on the button you assign with a Reset a form action. 
When you use this action, it’s best to associate it with Mouse Up to prevent accidental cursor 
movements that might clear the data and require the user to begin over again. Reset a form can 
also be used with a Page Action command. If you want a form to be reset every time the file is 
opened, the latter may be a better choice than creating a button.
TIP
TIP
When you design a form and view the form in either Form Editing or Viewer mode, 
select Forms ➪ Clear Form to reset a form. Using this command is handy if you have 
not yet added a Reset button to your form.

Submitting a form
Acrobat allows Form data to be e-mailed, submitted to Acrobat.com, or submitted to Web servers. 
You can design forms so users of the Adobe Reader software can submit data via e-mail or to Web 
servers. When using the Submit a form action, you have access to options for the type of data for-
mat you want to submit.

For more information on submitting form data, see Chapter 35.
Format properties
The General, Appearance, and Actions tabs are available for all field types. Option attributes are 
available for all field types except digital signatures. The options vary significantly depending on 
which field type is used. For a quick glance at the tab differences according to field type, take a 
look at Table 34.2.
Acrobat’s Data Search
W
hen a data file is identified for an import action, Acrobat looks to the location you specified 
when creating the action. Acrobat also searches other directories for the data. On the 
Macintosh, Acrobat looks to the Reader and Acrobat User Data directories for the data file. On 
Windows, Acrobat looks to the Acrobat directory, Reader directory, current directory, Windows 
directory, and Application Data directory. If Acrobat cannot find the data file, a dialog box opens 
containing a Browse button to prompt the user to locate the data file.

As shown in Table 34.2, the Format, Validate, and Calculate tab options are available only for 
Combo box and Text field types. To access the Format tab, select either of these field types. The 
Format options are the same for both field types.
When you click the Format tab, you’ll find a pull-down menu for selecting a format category. To 
define a format, open the Select format category and choose from the menu choices the format you 
want to assign to the Text or Combo Box field. As each item is selected, various options pertaining 
to the selected category appear directly below the pull-down menu. When you select Number from 
the menu choices, the Number Options appear as shown in Figure 34.29.
The Select format category menu options include:
 None. No options are available when None is selected. Select this item if no formatting is 
needed for the field. An example of where None applies would be a text field where you 
want text data such as name, address, and so on.
 Number. When you select Number, the Number Options choices appear below the 
Select format category pull-down menu. The options for displaying numeric fields 
include defining the number of decimal places, indicating how the digits are separated 
(for example, by commas or by decimal points), and specifying any currency symbols. 
The Negative Number Style check boxes enable you to display negative numbers with 
parentheses and/or red text.
 Percentage. The number of decimal places you want to display for percentages is avail-
able when you select Percentage from the pull-down menu. The options are listed for 
number of decimal places and the separator style.
 Date. The date choices offer different selections for month, day, year, and time formats.

1155

 FIGURE 34.29
When you choose either Combo Box or Text as the field type, you can select data format options from the 
Format tab.
 Time. If you want to eliminate the date and identify only time, the Time category enables 
you to do so, offering choices to express time in standard and 24-hour units and a cus-
tom setting where custom formats are user-prescribed in a field box.
 Special. The Special category offers formatting selections for Social Security number, 
Zip code, extended Zip codes, phone numbers, and an arbitrary mask. When you select 
Arbitrary Mask, a field box is added where you define the mask. The acceptable values 
for setting up an arbitrary mask include:
 A. Add A to the Arbitrary Mask field box, and only the alphabetical characters A – Z 
and a – z are acceptable for user input.
 X. When you add X to the Arbitrary Mask field box, most printable characters from 
an alphanumeric character set are acceptable. ANSI values between 32 – 166 and 
128 – 255 are permitted. (To learn more about what ANSI character values 32 – 166 
and 128 – 255 are translated to, search the Internet for ANSI character tables. You can 
capture Web pages and use the tables as reference guides.)
 O. The letter O accepts all alphanumeric characters (A – Z, a – z, and 0 – 9).

1156
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 9. If you want the user to be limited to filling in numbers only, enter 9 in the Arbitrary 
Mask field box.
 Custom. Custom formatting is available by using a JavaScript. To edit the JavaScript 
code, click the Edit button and create a custom format script. The JavaScript Editor dia-
log box opens where you type the code. As an example of using a custom JavaScript, 
assume that you want to add leading zeros to field numbers. You might create a 
JavaScript with the following code:
event.value = “000” + event.value;
 
The preceding code adds three leading zeros to all values supplied by the end user who 
completes the form field. If you want to add different characters as a suffix or prefix, 
enter the values you want within the quotation marks. To add a suffix, use
event.value = event.value + “000”;
Validate properties
Validate helps ensure proper information is added on the form. If a value must be within a certain 
minimum and maximum range, select the radio button for validating the data within the accepted 
values. (See Figure 34.30.) The field boxes are used to enter the minimum and maximum values. If 
the user attempts to enter a value outside the specified range, a warning dialog box opens, inform-
ing the user that the values entered on the form are unacceptable.
Selecting the Run custom validation script radio button and clicking the Edit button enables you to 
add a JavaScript. Scripts that you may want to include in this window would be those for validat-
ing comparative data fields. A password, for example, may need to be validated. If the response 
does not meet the condition, the user is denied access to supplying information in the field.
 FIGURE 34.30
Validate is used with Combo Box and Text field types to ensure acceptable responses from user-supplied 
values.

1157

Calculate properties
The Calculate tab (supported in Text and Combo fields) in the Field Properties window enables 
you to calculate two or more data fields. You can choose from preset calculation formulas or add a 
custom JavaScript for calculating fields, as shown in Figure 34.31.
The preset calculation formulas are limited to addition, multiplication, averaging, assessing the 
minimum in a range of fields, and assessing the maximum in a range of fields. For all other calcula-
tions you need to select the Simplified field notation or Custom calculation script radio button and 
click the Edit button. In the JavaScript Editor, you write JavaScripts to perform other calculations 
not available from the preset formulas. Simplified field notation is written in the JavaScript editor 
and follows syntax similar to writing formulas in spreadsheets. JavaScripts, also written in the 
JavaScript Editor, require you to know JavaScript as it is supported in Acrobat.

For more information on calculating data, see Chapters 35 and 36 (on the CD-ROM).
 FIGURE 34.31
The Calculate tab offers options for calculating fields for summing data, multiplying data, and finding the 
average, minimum, and maximum values for selected fields. In addition, you can add custom calculations 
by writing JavaScripts.

Selection Change properties
The Selection Change tab, shown in Figure 34.32, is available for List Box fields only. If a list box 
item is selected, and then a new item from the list is selected, JavaScript code can be programmed 
to execute an action when the change is made. As with the other dialog boxes, clicking the Edit 
button opens the JavaScript Editor dialog box where you create the JavaScript code.
A variety of uses exist for the Selection Change option. You might want to create a form for con-
sumer responses for a given product — something such as an automobile. Depending on informa-
tion preceding the list box selection, some options may not be available. For example, a user 
specifies “four-door automobile” as one of the form choices, and then from a list, that user selects 
“convertible.” If the manufacturer does not offer a convertible for four-door automobiles, then 
through use of a JavaScript in the Selection Change tab, the user is informed that this selection 
cannot be made based on previous information supplied in the form. The displayed warning could 
include information on alternative selections that the user could make.
 FIGURE 34.32
The Selection Change tab is available only for List Box fields. When using a Selection Change option, 
you’ll need to program JavaScript code to reflect the action when a change in selection occurs.
Digital Signature fields properties
The Digital Signature tool enables you to create a field used for electronically signing a document 
with a digital signature. The Signed tab offers options for behavior with digital signatures as follows:
 Nothing happens when signed. As the item description suggests, the field is signed but 
no action takes place upon signing.
 Mark as read-only. When signed, the selected fields are changed to read-only fields, lock-
ing them against further edits. You can mark all fields by selecting the radio button and 
choosing All fields from the pull-down menu. Choose All fields except these to isolate a few 
fields not marked for read-only, or select Just these fields to mark a few fields for read-only.

1159
Understanding Acrobat Form Tools
34
 This script executes when the field is signed. Select the radio button and click the Edit 
button to open the JavaScript Editor. Write a script in the JavaScript Editor that executes 
when the field is signed.
Digital signatures can be used to lock data fields. You can also use them to indicate approval 
from users or PDF authors, or you may want to display a message after a user signs a form. In 
Figure 34.33, a JavaScript was added to the Digital Signature Signed Properties.
The script in this example instructs a user to print the form and hand-deliver it to the accounting 
department. A dialog box opens after the user signs the form.

Barcode properties
The unique property settings in the Barcode field are located in the Value tab. Options in this tab 
are available only with barcode fields, as shown in Figure 34.34. You have options for Encoding 
from a pull-down menu offering a choice between XML and Tab Delimited data.
Click the Pick button and the Field Selection dialog box opens as shown in Figure 34.35. You use 
this dialog box to determine what field data are added to the barcode. Uncheck those items you 
don’t want added, such as buttons that invoke actions, temporary calculation fields, and so on. 
The Include field names text box offers an option to include field names along with the data in the 
barcode.

Managing Fields
For purposes of explanation, I’ll use the term managing fields to mean dealing with field duplica-
tion, deleting fields, and modifying field attributes. After you create a field on a PDF page, you may 
want to alter its size, position, or attributes. Editing form fields in Acrobat is made possible by 
using one of several menu commands or returning to the respective Field Properties window. This 
kind of editing can be performed in Form Editing Mode or Viewer mode.
Organizing fields
To edit a form field’s properties, use the Select Object tool. If you work in Form Editing Mode, the 
Select Object tool is the tool selection by default. Unless you choose a tool from the Add New Field 
menu, the only tool available to you without using a key modifier is the Select Object tool. In 
Viewer mode, you need to click the Select Object tool to make it the active tool. In either mode, 
open a context menu and choose Properties to open a field’s properties. Alternately, you can also 
double-click a field to open the properties dialog box.
When you select multiple fields and choose Properties from the context-sensitive menu, options in 
the General tab, the Appearance tab, and the Actions tab are available for editing. Specific options 
for each different field type require that you select only common field types. For example, you can 
edit the appearance settings for a group of fields where the field types are different. However, to 
edit something like radio button field options for check mark style, you need to select only radio 
button fields in order to gain access to the Options tab.
TIP
TIP
If the fields you want to select are located next to each other or you want to select 
many fields, use the Select Object tool and drag a marquee through the fields to be 
selected. When you release the mouse button, the fields inside the marquee and any fields inter-
sected by the marquee are selected. The marquee does not need to completely surround fields 
for selection — just include a part of the field box within the marquee.
Renaming fields
When you create a field in Form Editing Mode, an abbreviated properties window opens where 
you can name a field and set field attributes as a required field — meaning the field must be filled 
in before the data can be submitted. If you open a context menu in either Form Editing Mode or 
Viewer mode, the same properties window opens offering you the same options choices as shown 
in Figure 34.36.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
Acrobat 9 provides you a fast and easy method for changing field names using the 
Rename Field menu command. To change the field name, type a new name in the 
Field Name text box.

1162
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 FIGURE 34.36
Open a context menu and choose Rename Field to open the abbreviated properties where a field name 
can be changed.
Duplicating fields
You can duplicate a field by selecting it and holding down the Ctrl/Option key while clicking and 
dragging the field box. Fields can also be copied and pasted on a PDF page, between PDF pages, 
and between PDF documents. Select a field or multiple fields, and then choose Edit ➪ Copy. Move 
to another page or open another PDF document and choose Edit ➪ Paste. The field names and 
attributes are pasted together on a new page. Copying and pasting fields works well while in Form 
Editing or Viewer mode.
TIP
TIP
To ensure that field names are an exact match between forms, create one form with 
all the fields used on other forms. Copy the fields from the original form and paste 
the fields in other forms requiring the same fields. By pasting the fields, you ensure all field 
names are identical between forms and can easily swap data between them. If you have JavaScripts 
at the document level, use the Document ➪ Replace Pages command when you want to populate 
a form having a similar design to an original form.
Moving fields
You can relocate fields on the PDF page by using the Select Object tool and clicking and dragging 
the field to a new location. To constrain the angle of movement, select a field with the Select 
Object tool, press the Shift key, and drag the field to a new location. For precise movement, use 
the arrow keys to move a field box left, right, up, or down. When using the arrow keys to move a 
field, be certain to not use the Shift key while pressing the arrow keys because doing so resizes 
field boxes as opposed to moving them.
Deleting fields
You delete fields from PDF documents in three ways. Select the field and press the Backspace key 
(Windows) or Delete key (Macintosh). You can also select the field and then choose Edit ➪ Delete, 
or open a context menu and choose Edit ➪ Delete. In all cases, Acrobat removes the field without 
warning. If you inadvertently delete a field, you can Undo the operation by choosing Edit ➪ Undo.
Aligning fields
Even when you view the grids on the PDF page, aligning fields can sometimes be challenging. 
Acrobat simplifies field alignment by offering menu commands for aligning the field rectangles at 
the left, right, top, and bottom sides, as well as for specifying horizontal and vertical alignment on 

1163
Understanding Acrobat Form Tools
34
the PDF page. To align fields, select two or more fields and then open a context menu and select 
Align ➪ Distribute Center, as shown in Figure 34.37. The alignment options for Left, Right, Top, 
Bottom, Horizontally, and Vertically appear in a submenu.
 FIGURE 34.37
Open a context menu using the Select Object tool on one field in a group of selected fields and choose 
Align from the menu.
Acrobat aligns fields according to the first field selected (the anchor field appearing with a red 
highlight). In other words, the first field’s vertical position is used to align all subsequently selected 
fields to the same vertical position. The same holds true for left, right, and top alignment positions. 
When you use the horizontal and vertical alignments, the first field selected determines the center 
alignment position for all subsequently selected fields. All fields are center aligned either vertically 
or horizontally to the anchor field.
TIP
TIP
Fields are aligned to an anchor field when multiple fields are selected and you use 
the align, center, distribute, and size commands. The anchor field appears with a 
red border whereas the remaining selected field highlights are blue. If you want to change the 
anchor (the field to be used for alignment, sizing, and so on), click on any other field in the 
selected group. Unlike other multiple object selections, you don’t need to use the Shift key 
when selecting different fields from among a group of selected fields. All fields remain selected 
until you click outside the field boundaries of any selected field.
You can distribute fields on a PDF page by selecting multiple fields and choosing Distribute 
(Vertically or Horizontally) from the same submenu. Select either Horizontally or Vertically for the 
distribution type. The first and last fields in the group determine the beginning and ending of the 

1164

field distribution. All fields within the two extremes are distributed equidistant between the first 
and last fields.
CROSS-REF

For an example of how to use the Distribute commands, see “Creating multiple 
copies of fields” later in this chapter.
Center alignment is another menu command available from a context menu. When you choose 
Center (Vertically or Horizontally) from the same submenu shown in Figure 34.37, the selected field 
aligns to the horizontal or vertical center of the page. Choose Both to align a field to the center of a 
page. If multiple fields are selected, the alignment options take into account the relative positions of 
the field boxes and center the selected fields as a group while preserving their relative positions.
Sizing fields
Field rectangles can be sized to a common physical size. Once again, the anchor field determines 
the size attributes for the remaining fields selected. To size fields, select multiple field boxes, and 
then open a context menu and choose Size Fields to Same Size and choose Width, Height, or Both 
from the submenu. To size field boxes individually in small increments, hold down the Ctrl/
Option key and move the arrow keys. The Left and Right Arrow keys size field boxes horizontally, 
whereas the Up and Down arrow keys size field boxes vertically.
Creating multiple copies of fields
To create a table array, select fields either in a single row or single column and open a context 
menu. From the menu options, select Place Multiple Fields. The Create Multiple Copies of Fields 
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 34.38. In the Create Multiple Copies of Fields dialog box, 
enter a value in the field box for Copy selected fields down (for creating rows of fields) or Copy 
selected fields across (to create columns of fields). In Figure 34.38, I created three fields and 
wanted my duplicated fields to be added below the top row. Notice when you make selections in 
the Create Multiple Copies of Fields dialog box with the Preview check box enabled, you see a 
dynamic preview in the document for how the fields appear when duplicated.
NOTE
NOTE
You can also create a table array by first creating a single field and then selecting 
options for both Copy Selected Fields down and Copy Selected Fields across.
If you want to add both rows and columns, you can supply values in both field boxes for the 
desired number of columns and rows. The Change Width and Change Height field boxes enable 
you to adjust the field distance respective to each other — editing the values does not change the 
physical sizes of the fields. Click the Up/Down buttons for moving all fields vertically or the Left/
Right buttons to move fields horizontally. When the preview box is enabled, you’ll see a preview of 
the duplicated rows and columns before you accept the attribute choices by clicking OK.
If, after you click OK, you need to polish the position of the new fields, you can move the top and 
bottom fields (for aligning single columns), then open a context menu and choose Align, 
Distribute, or Center ➪ Vertically (or Horizontally) — depending on whether you’re adjusting a 
row or column.

 FIGURE 34.38
To create a table array, select a row or column of fields and open a context menu. Select Place Multiple 
Fields and make selections in the Create Multiple Copies of Fields dialog box for the number of rows or 
columns to be duplicated.
When using the Distribute command, you can distribute only single rows or columns. If you 
attempt to select all fields in a table and distribute several rows or columns at once, the results ren-
der an offset distribution that most likely creates an unusable alignment.
Duplicating fields
Using the Place Multiple Fields menu command from a context menu enables you to create table 
arrays or individual columns or rows only on a single page. If you want to duplicate fields either 
on a page or through a number of pages, another menu command exists for field duplication.
You can use the Duplicate command to duplicate fields; however, in most circumstances when you 
want to duplicate a field, press the Ctrl/Option key and click+drag a field. The field and the prop-
erties are duplicated. If you need to change the field name, open the properties dialog box and edit 
the Name in the General properties.
Setting attribute defaults
If you spend time formatting attributes for field appearances, options, and actions, you may want 
to assign a default attribute set for all subsequent fields created with the same form tool. After cre-
ating a field with the attributes you want, open a context menu and select Use Current Properties 
as New Defaults. The properties options used for the field selected, when you choose the menu 

1166
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
command, become a new default for that field type. As you change form tools and create different 
fields, you can assign different defaults to different field types.
Setting field tab orders
You have two options for setting the tab order on a form. This is one item you should address 
before saving your final edited form. You should be able to press the Tab key to enter the first field 
on a page and tab through the remaining fields in a logical order to make it easy for the end user to 
fill in your form. Before deploying your form, be sure to check the tab order.
The first option you have for setting Tab order is in the Pages panel. Enter Viewer mode and open the 
Pages panel. Open a context menu on the page where you want to set tab order. Select Properties from 
the menu options and the Page Properties dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 34.39. By default the 
Tab Order pane opens with options for setting tab order by making radio button selections.
 FIGURE 34.39
To set tab order, open the Pages panel and open a context menu on the page where you want to edit the tab 
order. Select Properties from the menu choices and click on Tab Order in the Page Properties dialog box.
The options for setting tab order include the following:
 Use Row Order. Tabs through rows from left to right. If you want to change the direction 
for tabbing through fields, choose File ➪ Properties. Click on Advanced in the left pane and 
select Right Edge from the Binding pull-down menu. When you select Use Row Order and 
the document binding is set to Right Edge, the tab order moves from right to left.
 Use Column Order. Tabs through columns from left to right, or right to left if you 
change the binding as described in the preceding bullet.
 Use Document Structure. When selecting this option, you first need to use a PDF docu-
ment with structure and tags. The tab order is determined by the structure tree created by 
the original authoring application when the file was exported to PDF.

1167

 Unspecified. The default for all documents you created in earlier versions of Acrobat that 
you open in Acrobat 6 through 8 have the Unspecified option selected. Unless you physi-
cally change the tab order to one of the preceding options, the tab order remains true to 
the order set in Acrobat 5 or earlier.
The order in which you create fields and add them to a page is recorded. If you happen to create a 
row of fields, and then change your mind and want to add a new field in the middle of the row, 
Acrobat tabs to the last field in the row from the last field created. Changing the tab orders in the 
Page Properties won’t help you fix the problem when the fields need to be reordered.
Fortunately, you do have more options for setting tab orders. The second method, and perhaps 
your best choice, is the Form Editing Mode for arranging fields in the proper tab order.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
In Acrobat 9 you can drag and drop fields in the Fields panel to change the tab 
order. Click a field in the Fields panel in Form Editing Mode and drag the field up or 
down in the Fields panel to change the tab order.
If you want to see a visual order of your fields on a form, open a context menu on any field and 
choose Show Tab Numbers. Each field displays the tab order number in the top-left corner of the 
field box as shown in Figure 34.40.

Summary
 Acrobat forms are not scanned documents converted to PDF. They are dynamic and can 
include interactive elements, data fields, buttons, and JavaScripts.
 Automatic form fill-in is enabled in the Preferences dialog box. Form fields can be dis-
played on PDF pages with a highlight color to help identify field locations.
 Data fields are created from many different field types including text, buttons, combo 
boxes, list boxes, signatures, check boxes, radio buttons, and barcodes.
 You set all data field attributes in the Field Properties window. Properties can be 
described for fields by selecting the tabs labeled Appearance, Options, Actions, 
Calculations, or other tabs associated with specific field types.
 Acrobat 9 has a new Form Editing mode where you add field objects via a pull-down 
menu where the various form tools are selected.
 In Acrobat 9, you edit forms in Form Editing Mode and fill in or check form functionality 
in Preview mode.
 You can edit fields with a context-sensitive menu. Acrobat has several editing commands 
used for aligning fields, distributing fields, and centering fields on a PDF page.
 Field duplication is handled in a context menu. You can duplicate fields on a page to cre-
ate tables with the Place Multiple Fields command, or duplicate fields across multiple 
pages with the Duplicate command.
 The Fields panel dynamically lists all fields created in a PDF file. The panel menus and 
options can be of much assistance in editing field names and locating fields. The panel is 
in view only in Form Editing Mode.
 A form’s tab order can be easily reordered by dragging fields up and down in the Fields 
panel.

A
fter you get a handle on creating form fields, as covered in Chapter 
34, you’ll want to know some things about managing data to help 
economize your efforts when working with distributed forms and 
performing routine calculations on data fields. When forms are completed, 
you have the option of printing a form, compiling form data distributed via 
emails or your Acrobat.com account, or sending the data off to a form server 
product that processes the field data. In this chapter, I cover data manage-
ment from calculating field data to importing, exporting, and submitting 
data, and compiling data using the new Acrobat.com features in Acrobat 9.
As is the case with most of the content in Chapter 33, this chapter is also tar-
geted at users working with Adobe LiveCycle Designer as well as Acrobat. 
Most of what is covered in this chapter can be handled by Designer, how-
ever, if you’re a Macintosh user or you want to do some editing in Acrobat, 
what follows is strictly related to working with data and form fields in 
Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro, and Acrobat Pro Extended. Furthermore, the 
content is restricted to using Acrobat tools and commands for data manage-
ment. No discussion on using server products, other than a brief explanation 
about additional products you can acquire, is covered in this chapter.
For Windows users, if you need to with other data systems the best opportu-
nity you have when working with form data is to create your form designs 
in Adobe LiveCycle Designer as explained in Chapter 33. Designer provides 
you with XDP, XML, and as export data format options and XDP, XML, and 
XFD as import format options. With Acrobat form data imports you get 
FDF, XFDF, XFD, TXT, and a version of XML; and export formats consisting 
of FDF, XFDF, XML, and TXT. Designer has much fewer import/export for-
mats as compared to Acrobat.

Setting Up the Environment
As described in the previous chapter, creating form fields requires you to use the Form Editing 
Mode. The same toolbars used in Chapter 34 (Advanced Editing and the Properties Bar) are used 
to handle form field editing and field property changes. For setting up the Toolbar Well, refer to 
Chapter 34.
In addition to using form fields, having access to menu commands helps you manage data while 
working with forms. Nothing specific needs to be opened for menu access. As you move through 
this chapter, I’ll cover the various menu options used for data management and the new options 
for using Acrobat.com introduced in Acrobat 9.
NOTE
NOTE
Just in case you jump to this chapter and haven’t reviewed earlier chapters in this 
book, be aware that you have two working modes when creating/editing PDF forms. 
Form fields and a number of form editing tasks are handled in the new Acrobat 9 Form Editing 
Mode, and other edits are performed in normal Viewer mode. When I refer to Viewer mode in 
this chapter, be aware that this view is the standard Acrobat editing mode you’re familiar with in 
all viewers prior to Acrobat 9.

For more information on using Form Editing Mode, see Chapter 34.
Calculating Field Data
More often than not, you’ll want to create forms that use some kind of calculation for data fields. 
Calculations might be used for summing data, calculating averages, adding complex formulas, 
assessing field responses, or many other conditions where results need to be placed in separate 
fields.
Acrobat offers you a few limited built-in functions for performing math operations. When your 
needs extend beyond these simple functions, you need to write JavaScripts. Some math operations, 
as simple as subtracting data or producing a dividend, require use of a JavaScript.
Even though I address JavaScript in some detail in the next chapter, you need to begin learning 
about JavaScript as it pertains to calculating data. Therefore, I’ll start this chapter with some exam-
ples on using the built-in functions for calculations in Acrobat and move on, later in this section, 
to cover some JavaScript basics.
Formatting for calculations
Math operations can be performed on data fields without any formatting applied to either the fields 
to be calculated or the result field. Although doing so is not required, as a matter of practice apply-
ing formats to all fields where calculations are made and to those fields participating in the calcula-
tion result is a good idea. As you create a PDF form, you may need to use a particular format that 

1171
Working with Form Data
35
eventually is required either in the formula or for the text appearance in the result field. Rather 
than going back to the fields and changing the format, you’ll save time by supplying proper for-
mats as you create fields.
When creating text fields, open the Format tab in the Text Field Properties window and select the 
format you want for the field. If Number is the desired format, select Number from the pull-down 
menu and make choices for the number of decimal places, the display for negative numbers if it 
applies, and the use of a currency symbol if it applies.
TIP
TIP
You can open the field Properties dialog box either in Form Editing Mode or Viewer 
mode. In Viewer mode use the Select Object tool and double-click a field object to 
open the Properties dialog box.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on using the Text Field tool, see Chapter 34.
Many times, once you get a field formatted, you want to replicate the attributes on subsequent 
fields. When you set the attributes for one field, select the field with the Select Object tool and 
open a context menu in either Form Editing Mode or Viewer mode. Select Use Current Properties 
as New Defaults. As you create additional fields, the new defaults are applied to all subsequent text 
fields. If you create a field that needs a different format, you can change the format for the new 
field without affecting the defaults.
TIP
TIP
Although you can’t create new fields while in Viewer mode using a form tool, 
you can duplicate a field by clicking with the Select Object tool and pressing  
Ctrl/Option while dragging the field.
Using the preset calculation formulas
Preset math calculations include sum, product, average, minimum, and maximum. After format-
ting fields, select the field where you want the result to appear and click the Calculate tab in the 
Text Field Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 35.1. For adding a column or row of data, 
select the Value is the radio button. The default is sum (+). Click the down-pointing arrow to open 
the pull-down menu to make formula choices from the list of other preset formulas.
NOTE
NOTE
Be certain numeric data is formatted using number format options in the Format tab 
of the Text Field Properties dialog box when creating form fields.
For summing data, leave the default as it appears and click the Pick button. The Field Selection 
dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 35.2. You can see the fields added to your form and grouped 
together. To sum a group of fields, select the check box to the left side of each field you want to 
add to the formula.
Click OK to leave the Field Selection dialog box and return to the Calculate properties. Click 
Close, and the calculation is ready. In this example, the sum of the data for the selected fields 
updates as the user enters data in the fields assigned to the calculation.

1172
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 FIGURE 35.1
To add a preset calculation to a field, click the Calculate tab in the Text Field Properties dialog box. Select 
the calculation formula from the pull-down menu next to the “Value is the” radio button.
For performing other preset calculations, you follow the same steps. Select the formula you want to 
use from the pull-down menu options and select the check boxes for all fields you want to add to 
the calculation.
NOTE
NOTE
When using the Average formula, Acrobat averages all fields regardless of whether 
the fields used in the formula contain data. If you have three fields, but only two have 
values — for example, 3 and 3 — Acrobat returns a result of 2 ((3+3+0) ÷ 3=2). The preset formula 
doesn’t take into consideration whether or not a field has data in it. To perform an average calcula-
tion where you want to average only fields containing a response, you need to write a JavaScript.
Summing data on hierarchical names
If you’ve read Chapter 34, you may remember that I mentioned advantages when using parent/
child names for form fields. As you can see in Figure 35.2, all the fields in your form are listed in 
the Field Selection dialog box. If you want to sum data in large tables, clicking all the boxes in the 
Field Selection dialog box to select fields for columns or rows in a table can take some time. 
However, when you use hierarchical (or parent/child) names, the task is much easier.
In Figure 35.3, the Field Selection dialog box is open and a check mark appears next to the item
Total field. Notice below this field you have a group of fields using the same parent name. The 
child names 0 through 6 are calculated with just the check box selection made on the parent name 
when summing the fields. If you write calculation scripts, your scripting is made much easier when 
using parent/child names.

1173

 FIGURE 35.2
Identify the fields used for the calculation in the Field Selection dialog box by selecting the check box for 
each field name.
 FIGURE 35.3
If you select the Value is the Sum(+) of the following fields radio button and check a parent name in the 
Field Selection dialog box, all child field names are added in the calculation.
Imagine a table that contains 25 rows of data with a total field at the bottom of each column; it has 
10 columns across the page. By using the parent name in the formula, you can easily create total 
fields at the bottom of the page by duplicating fields and editing the parent names in the Calculate 
properties as was described in Chapter 34.

1174
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
Using hidden fields
Complex formulas can be written in the JavaScript Editor. However, if you aren’t up to speed in 
JavaScript programming or you want to simplify the code you write, you may want to break down 
a series of calculations and place results in separate fields. For example, suppose you want to cal-
culate the result of A - B * C. If you don’t know the code to create the calculation to first subtract 
two values and multiply the result by another value, you can use separate fields to hold results. In 
this example, you need a field to hold the result of A – B. In another calculation, you take the 
result field containing A – B and multiply it by C.
On the PDF form, the result of A – B is not needed for user input — it’s simply a container to use 
as part of the larger formula. To help avoid confusion, you can hide the field. When data are con-
tained in hidden fields, the data can still be used for calculations.
To create such a field, add a text field anywhere on a page and add the calculation in the Calculate 
properties. In the General properties, select Hidden from the Form Field pull-down menu. If you 
need to edit a hidden text field, you can do so with either the Text Field tool or the Select Object tool.
When using hidden fields, you can create calculations and access the fields in the Field Selection 
dialog box or use parent names in the Calculate properties as described in the preceding section.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information related to hiding fields, see Chapter 34.
Using Simplified Field Notation
In addition to performing simple calculations and writing JavaScripts, the Calculate pane also 
offers you an option for using simplified field notation. When you select the radio button for 
Simplified field notation and click Edit, the JavaScript Editor dialog box opens. In the dialog box 
you don’t write JavaScript code. The code added here is based on principles used with spreadsheet 
formulas.
Simplified field notation can be used in lieu of writing JavaScripts for many different math operations. 
As an example, suppose you want to calculate a sales tax for a subtotal field. To calculate an 8 percent 
sales tax with a JavaScript you would open the JavaScript Editor and type the following code:
1. var f = this.getField(“subtotal”);
2. event.value = Math.round(f.value * 8) / 100;
As an alternative to using JavaScript, select the Simplified field notation radio button and click the 
Edit button. In the JavaScript Editor, you type the following code to produce the same sales tax 
calculation:
1. subtotal * .08

1175
Working with Form Data
35
Notice in the JavaScript code you need to identify each field used in a calculation and assign a variable 
to the field name. Line 1 of the preceding JavaScript code assigns the variable f to the field subto-
tal. Notice that in the Simplified Field Notation script the field name does not get assigned to a vari-
able. You simply use all field names as they appear on the form and introduce them in your formulas.
CAUTION 
CAUTION
You cannot use hierarchical names when using simplified field notation.
Using JavaScripts
You need to write JavaScripts for all calculations that cannot be made with either the preset formu-
las or the simplified field notation method. If you are a novice, you’ll find writing simple 
JavaScripts to be a relatively easy task if you understand a few basic concepts in regard to perform-
ing simple calculations, as follows:
 Variables. Variables consist of using characters (alphabetical and numeric) to identify a 
field, a result, or other variable used in the formula. You can use something as simple 
as a character name or a long descriptive name. Variables might be f, amt, 
item0grandTotal, Price Amount, and so on.
 Identifying fields. You need to tell Acrobat in the JavaScript code that you want to 
assign a variable name to a field that exists on your form. The syntax for assigning a field 
to a variable name might look like
var f = this.getField(“item”);
 
In the preceding code the field name appears in quote marks and the quote marks are 
contained within parentheses. The variable f is assigned to the field name item on this 
(the current open) document.
 Algebraic formulas. After identifying the variables, you use standard algebraic notation. 
Therefore, to divide one value by another (something not available to you with the preset 
formulas), you might enter the code shown in Figure 35.4 in the JavaScript Editor as 
 follows:
1. var f = this.getField(“amount”);
2. var g = this.getField(“itemNumber”);
3. event.value = f.value / g.value;
 
The first line assigns the variable f to the field amount. The second line of code assigns 
the variable g to the field itemNumber. The third line of code is the formula where f is 
divided by g. The result is placed in the field where you add this script in the JavaScript 
Editor. The trigger to put the result in the field where the calculation is coded is the 
event.value item.

1176
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 FIGURE 35.4
Select Custom calculation script in the Calculation properties and enter the code to per-
form the calculation in the JavaScript Editor.
Without going into loops and more complex formulas, the beginning Acrobat forms author can do 
quite a bit by just following the preceding simple example. The code is all case sensitive and your 
field names need to be identical to the name of the field on the form as you code in the JavaScript 
Editor.
My good friend and colleague Thom Parker who hosts the JavaScript Corner on Acrobat Users 
(www.acrobatusers.com/go/javascript) fields questions almost daily from Acrobat users 
about JavaScript-related questions. The first question Thom asks people who contact him is, “Have 
you looked at the Acrobat JavaScript Scripting Reference?” This document is Thom’s Bible, and 
even accomplished JavaScript programmers like Thom use it regularly as a reference. If you 
want to learn more about JavaScript, you can download the reference from www.adobe.com/
devnet/acrobat/javascript.html. You can also find much help related to JavaScript on 
Adobe’s Web site at www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/js_api_reference.pdf.
Managing Form Data
Managing form data, whether it is Acrobat PDF form data or data in the Adobe LiveCycle Designer 
environment, essentially falls into two categories. One category is industrial-strength data manage-
ment satisfying needs of business enterprises and organizations requiring sophisticated tools beyond 
Acrobat for collecting and routing data. The other category is local data management you handle 
using Acrobat and tools within the Acrobat environment for individual and small business needs.

1177
Working with Form Data
35
In regard to enterprise data management solutions, you’ll find a number of server products devel-
oped by Adobe Systems to satisfy the most demanding data management needs. Adobe markets 
products like Adobe LiveCycle Forms (formerly Adobe LiveCycle Form Server) and several other 
server products designed to satisfy just about any business need for managing documents and data. 
All of the Adobe Server products can be found at www.adobe.com/products/server or 
www.adobe.com/livecycle/.
Another avenue for enterprise solutions is the Adobe Partner community. Adobe works together 
with a great number of third-party developers to provide an array of solutions satisfying vertical 
market needs. You can learn more about Adobe partners and the solutions they offer at www.
adobe.com/enterprise/partners. In addition to Adobe Systems and Adobe partners, sev-
eral independent developers provide more server solutions and services to help you define needs 
and customize your data management requirements. You can find out more about some other 
developers by searching the Internet.
In short, when it comes to handling data for large-scale business transactions, you need to look 
outside Acrobat and find a provider that can deliver the solution that fits your specific needs. One 
thing to keep in mind is that you don’t use Acrobat to take form data for invoices and sales receipts 
for companies such as Sprint, Boeing, Time-Warner, and similar large enterprises, and expect to 
write backend code to route data. You need Acrobat and some help from other products designed 
to work with PDF data.
As an example, take the US Internal Revenue Service. The US IRS certainly has more money and 
programming staff than one can imagine. However, the IRS has outsourced data routing since it 
began using online fillable PDF forms in the early 2000s — initially using the Adobe Form Server 
product and later using a third-party product. The IRS has never handled data routing for its huge 
number of forms with in-house programming staff.
In terms of local data management, and because this book is about Acrobat and what you can do 
with the product as it comes out of the box, you have many tools, commands, and Adobe services 
for managing form data. To begin understanding the handling of form data, let’s start by looking at 
how to import and export PDF data in a local environment.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
What I can hope to do in this book is expose you to a limited view for handling data 
and working with PDF forms. For a more comprehensive view of creating PDF forms 
in Acrobat and LiveCycle Designer and managing form data, see the PDF Forms Using Acrobat 
and LiveCycle Designer Bible (Wiley Publishing, Padova/Okamoto).
Importing and exporting data
One of the great benefits of importing and exporting data is the ability to eliminate redundancy in 
re-creating common data used in different forms. Among the most common redundant data entries 
is your personal identifying information. Adding your name, address, phone number, and so on to 
forms is often a common practice. In an environment where you need to supply your personal 
identity information, you could keep an FDF (Form Data File) or XML file on your hard drive and 
load it into different PDF forms, thereby eliminating the need to re-key the data.

1178
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
In order to swap data between forms, you need to observe one precaution. All data fields used to 
import FDF/XML data must have identically matched names to the fields from which the data were 
exported, including case sensitivity. Therefore, the data from a field called Name in a PDF that 
exports to FDF/XML cannot be introduced in a PDF with a field called name. Setting up the fields is 
your first task, and then you can move on to data exports and imports. To clarify this concept fur-
ther, I first show you how to design forms with common fields, and then export and import data.
Creating common fields
To be certain your field names match exactly between two forms, the easiest and most efficient way 
to duplicate the fields is to copy fields from one form and paste them into another form. In Figure 
35.5, I have a form designed as an annual tournament schedule. Some of the data from my sched-
ule card is identical to some data on a scorecard shown in Figure 35.6.
TIP
TIP
You can copy/paste fields while in normal Viewer mode without having to enter 
Form Editing Mode. Just use the Select Object tool to select fields for copying.
After copying fields from the schedule card and pasting the matching fields into the scorecard, 
I know I have an exact field match, and the data exported from the populated form will find the 
matching fields in the form shown in Figure 35.6.
TIP
TIP
If you need to copy all fields on the form, select the Select Object tool and press 
Ctrl+A (Windows) or Ô+A (Macintosh) to select all fields — in either Form Editing 
Mode or Viewer mode. Press Ctrl+C (Windows) or Ô+C (Macintosh) to copy all the selected 
fields to the Clipboard.
Understanding PDF Form Data Formats
F
DF is a legacy format supported by earlier versions of Acrobat from 4.0 and above. This is a pro-
prietary Adobe format and not a data file you can use with a lot of applications or that you can 
open for editing. XML is a newer format introduced in Acrobat 6 and available in Acrobat 7 through 
9. You can open XML files in a text editor and edit the data. You can also view the data in a Web 
browser.
I make references to FDF/XML throughout this chapter for those who need to work with legacy files 
not supporting XML and for those Acrobat 6-or-greater-compatible files where XML can be used. If 
you have a choice when exporting or importing data in Acrobat 6–compatible files or greater, use 
XML as your default data file format. If you need to add JavaScript to handle the data you may want 
to stick with FDF as the export format.

Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
Exporting FDF/XML data
After the forms have been created with matching fields, complete a form and fill in all the data 
fields. If you have some fields on one form that have been excluded on a second form, Acrobat 
ignores any field data where it can’t find a matching field name. Therefore, you need not worry 
about having the same number of fields on both documents.
Exporting data from a PDF file is handled with a menu command. If you want to export the data 
from a form, choose Forms ➪ Manage Form Data ➪ Export Data. A dialog box opens where you 
name the file and designate a destination for the FDF/XML data.
When you select the menu command, the Export Form Data As dialog box opens. By default, the 
name of your PDF file and a .fdf (or .xml) extension are supplied in the File name field box. This 
name is used as the FDF/XML filename. If you want to change the name, edit text in the File name 
field, but be certain to leave a .xml (or .fdf) extension after the filename. Click Save to save the file 
as an XML (or FDF) file.
The file you save as FDF/XML contains only the data from the form fields. Therefore, the file size is 
considerably smaller than the PDF that produced the data. The file can be stored on a local disk or 
network server, sent as an email attachment to another user, or uploaded to your Acrobat.com 
library. If another user has a PDF with the same field names, the data can be imported with one of 
the Acrobat products.
Exporting Form Data
T
he default export format when you choose Forms ➪ Manage Form Data ➪ Export Data is Acrobat 
FDF (*.fdf* extension files). In the Export Form Data As dialog box you can also choose to export 
data as Acrobat XFDF, XML, or Text formats. Depending on your uses for the data, be certain to 
check the export format shown in the Export Form Data As dialog box. The default choice is FDF. If 
you want to export and use XML data, choose XML Files (*.xml) from the Save as type (Windows) or 
Format (Macintosh) pull-down menu.
Something else to remember is that you can only export and import form data while in normal 
Viewer mode. You don’t have access to these menu commands when in Form Editing Mode.

Importing FDF/XML data
As with form data exports, importing FDF/XML data in PDF forms is handled with menu com-
mands. Choose Forms ➪ Manage Form Data ➪ Import Data (in Viewer mode). The Select File 
Containing Form Data dialog box opens where you can navigate your hard drive and find the  
FDF/XML file to import.
Select the FDF/XML file to be imported and click the Select button in the dialog box. When you 
import data from common field names, the fields are populated for all matching fields as shown in 
my new scorecard file after the data import in Figure 35.7. Acrobat ignores all data where no 
matching fields are found.
 FIGURE 35.7
Only data with matching field names are imported. All other data is ignored.
Creating spreadsheets from form data
Exporting data to spreadsheets can be handled in a few different ways. You can select from two dif-
ferent menu commands to export data that can be opened in a program such as Microsoft Excel, or 
you can aggregate form data from multiple forms into a single spreadsheet.
Exporting data to a spreadsheet
Two different menu commands enable you to export PDF data and open the exported data in a 
spreadsheet. You can open a PDF document and select Forms ➪ Manage Form Data ➪ Export Data. 
In the Export Form Data As dialog box, open the Save as type (Windows) pull-down menu or 
Format (Macintosh) pull-down menu and select Text as the file format. Click the Save button and 
the data can be opened in a spreadsheet program.

1182
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
Using Import Buttons and Page Actions
A
nother method you have available for importing data is to create a button or page action and 
use the Import form data action type. Create a button or open the Pages panel and select Page 
Properties from a context menu. In the Page Properties dialog box, shown in the following figure, 
click the Actions tab and select the Page Open trigger (this menu choice opens by default). From the 
Select Action pull-down menu, choose Import form data and click Add.
The Select File Containing Form Data dialog box opens. Select the data file you want to import and 
click the Select button. Save your file, and when the document opens on the target page Acrobat 
automatically imports data from the data file. You might use this method when you prepare forms 
such as a purchase order form for a vendor where you want your identifying information and the 
vendor information imported when preparing the order form. If you use a text file containing several 
vendors, click the vendor you want to use to import the respective data.
You’ll note that you have no option for exporting data using a button or page action. In earlier ver-
sions of Acrobat you could get around the absence of an action type for exporting data by using an 
Execute a menu item action type. In Acrobat 8 and 9, however, the Execute a menu item list is more 
limiting and you can’t select a menu command from the list to export data using a button, book-
mark, link, or page action.
Note that if you add the Import Form Data action to a button, link, bookmark, or page action, the 
only file format supported by the action type is FDF data. If you want to import other file formats 
such as TXT or XML, you need to write a JavaScript.
CROSS-REF

For more information on using page actions and learning more about limitations 
with the Execute a menu item command, see Chapter 22.
When you open the exported text data in MS Excel, the Text Import Wizard opens as shown in 
Figure 35.8. Step through the wizard and click Finish to open the data in a new Excel spreadsheet.
Acrobat also provides a means for aggregating data from multiple forms into an Excel spreadsheet. 
Select Forms ➪ Manage Form Data ➪ Merge Data Files into Spreadsheet. This command works when 
you want to export data from a single file, but the real power in using the command is when you 

1183
Working with Form Data
35
export data from multiple files. If you have a single PDF document and you use this command, the 
result is similar to exporting data from the Export Data command. Using the Export Data command 
exports to a text file, and using the Merge Data Files into Spreadsheet command exports to a CSV 
comma-delimited file or XML file. The text file created from the Export command is also a delimited 
file. As a result, you see very little difference when either file is opened in a program such as 
Microsoft Excel. All the data fall into rows and columns.
 FIGURE 35.8
The Text Import Wizard is launched in MS Excel when you open an exported text file from Acrobat.
Aggregating data from multiple files into a single spreadsheet
As I mentioned before, the real power in using the Merge Data Files into Spreadsheet command is 
when combining data from multiple PDFs into a spreadsheet. To see how this command works, 
follow these steps:
STEPS: Combining data from multiple PDFs into a spreadsheet file
 
1. Collect some forms with different data fields. To follow these steps, start with a form 
saved as different files having unique data. Save several forms to a common folder. In my 
example I used a simple form, as shown in Figure 35.9. Notice that the fields are high-
lighted so you can clearly see the form fields. I edited this form and changed the data for 
three additional forms and saved them all to the same folder.
NOTE
NOTE
You can add files from different folders to merge the data into a spreadsheet.

1184

 FIGURE 35.9
Use the same form with different data, saving each file to a common folder.
 
2. Select Forms ➪ Manage Form Data ➪ Merge Data Files into Spreadsheet. Note that 
you don’t need a document open in the document pane. If a document is open, the 
merge command doesn’t use the open file. The Export Data From Multiple Forms dialog 
box opens.
 
3. Add Files. Click Add Files and select the files you want to combine together in a single 
spreadsheet.
 
 The Select File Containing Form Data dialog box opens. Select the files you want to com-
bine together and click Select. When you return to the Export Data From Multiple Forms 
dialog box, the files you selected are shown in a window as you can see in Figure 35.10.
 
4. Click Export.
 
5. Name and save the file. When you click the Export button in the Export Data From 
Multiple Forms dialog box, the Select Folder to Save File dialog box opens. In this dialog 
box you locate a target folder and type a name for your file. By default the name provided 
in the File name text box is report. Edit the name and type a descriptive name for the file 
you save.
 
6. Click Export.
 
7. View the file. In a very short time the Export Progress dialog box opens as shown in 
Figure 35.11. Click the View File Now button and Microsoft Excel is launched, display-
ing the merged data.

Aggregating FDF/XML data
When you create a Submit button, as I explain in the next section “Submitting and Receiving Form 
Data,” Adobe Reader users can’t submit a PDF document back to you unless the form is enabled 
with Reader usage rights. If a form is not enabled, Reader users can submit the FDF/XML data back 
to you (without the PDF document) and you can use the Import Data command to import the 
FDF/XML data into a PDF form residing on your computer.
If you send files for Reader users and the data are returned to you as FDF/XML, you can aggregate 
the data in a spreadsheet using the same menu commands as you do when aggregating form data 
derived from PDF documents. Using the Forms ➪ Manage Form Data ➪ Merge Data Files into 
Spreadsheet menu command, follow the same steps as when merging PDF forms data. When you 
click Add Files and open the Select File Containing Form Data dialog box, notice the formats sup-
ported in the Files of type (Windows) or Format (Macintosh) pull-down menu. You find FDF/XML 
included as a format as well as PDF and XFDF.

If you use a wizard to distribute forms, all wizards in Acrobat 9 automatically enable 
PDF forms with Adobe Reader usage rights. The only time you need to enable a PDF 
using the Advanced ➪ Extend Features in Adobe Reader menu command is when you distribute a 
form manually as opposed to using a wizard.
Submitting and Receiving Form Data
We’ve come a long way with data exports, imports, submissions, and retrieval in Acrobat. Several 
generations ago, back in Acrobat 5, Adobe Reader users needed to view a PDF document inside a 
Web browser to submit form data. With the last few releases of Acrobat, Adobe Reader users could 
click a button designed for submitting data on PDF forms inside Acrobat without having to view 
the PDF in a Web browser. In Acrobat 8, we were introduced to form submissions from Reader 
users via email attachments where the Reader users could submit the entire PDF document with 
the form data back to the forms author. Inasmuch as the great developments in Acrobat 8 provided 
much easier forms distribution and data merging, we still had limitations with data retrieval on 
servers. Unless you are a programmer or have a friend in the IT department, setting up a server for 
data collection was out of the question.
CROSS-REF

For more information on viewing PDFs inside Web browsers as inline views, see 
Chapter 27.

All this has changed in Acrobat 9. Now with the opportunity to manage forms on 
Acrobat.com many forms authors don’t need to hassle with server configurations to 
collect and track distributed forms. You still have the option to share and collect forms via email 
attachments, but the great new features you find in Acrobat.com are likely to minimize the num-
ber of forms you distribute via email attachments.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
Acrobat.com is a separate service provided by Adobe Systems. Together with 
Acrobat 9, you can use Acrobat.com services to submit forms and collect data that 
can be downloaded from recipient responses from your Acrobat.com account. To learn more 
about using Acrobat.com, see Chapter 29.
Creating a Submit Form button
In all Acrobat viewers 8 and below that supported PDF forms, a Submit button was added to a 
form when you wanted the form to be sent someplace — either back to you as an email attachment 
or to a server where you collected forms.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
In Acrobat 9 you have two different options for using a Submit Form button. The 
button can be constructed with a Submit Form action and appear on your form 
like it did with earlier Acrobat viewers, or a Submit Form button can appear in the Document 
Message Bar automatically when you distribute a form. If you have a form that you email to 
recipients, you can use a form containing a submit button you add to the form. If you use the 
Forms ➪ Distribute Form command, Acrobat opens a wizard where you make choices for distrib-
uting a form and a submit form button is automatically added in the Document Message Bar.

1187
Working with Form Data
35
Distributing forms can be handled in one of several ways. You can send a form via email to recipi-
ents, in which case you’ll need to perform some manual tasks to prepare your form for distribu-
tion, or you can use the Distribute Form command in either normal Viewer mode or Form Editing 
Mode. When distributing a form, you can elect to use Acrobat.com, your own internal server, or 
send forms via email attachments.
If you choose to use the Distribute Form command, Acrobat takes care of some tasks automatically 
for you. You don’t have to create a Submit Form button, and you don’t have to manually enable a 
PDF form with Adobe Reader usage rights. Through an easy process of walking through some wiz-
ard steps, Acrobat takes care of these details for you.
You can also let Acrobat take care of automating tasks when you want forms emailed back to you. 
Again, you follow some steps via a wizard and submit your form via an email attachment. And 
again, Acrobat takes care of the Submit Form button and enabling tasks.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on enabling forms with Adobe Reader usage rights, see 
Chapter 19.
A third option is to avoid working with a wizard and manually send a form off to a recipient. You 
might have a form stored locally on your hard drive and occasionally send the form for a user to 
complete and send back to you. In this case, you’re not interested in aggregating data from multi-
ple users, but simply collecting some data related to some sort of specific instance.
If you decide to email a form without using a wizard, you need to manually address two things. 
First, your form needs a Submit Form button with your email address specified in the Submit 
Form action, and the form needs to be enabled with Adobe Reader usage rights when Adobe 
Reader users participate as form recipients.
When you want to distribute a form using a wizard, follow these steps:
STEPS: Distributing a Form
 
1. Open a PDF form with form fields in Acrobat. In these steps we’ll set up a form for 
email distribution. Since we’ll use a wizard to distribute the form, we don’t need a button 
on the form to submit the form back to you.
 
2. Distribute the form. Choose Forms ➪ Distribute Form in either normal Viewer mode or 
Form Editing Mode. The Distribute Form wizard opens as show in Figure 35.12.
 
3. Choose a collection method for acquiring the form data. From the pull-down menu in 
the wizard choose the form collection method you want to use. For this example I use 
Manually collect responses in my email inbox as shown in Figure 35.12
 
4. Click Next. The second pane in the wizard opens as shown in Figure 35.13.
 
5. Choose a method for distributing the form. When you choose to collect data in your 
email inbox you have two options for distributing the form as shown in Figure 35.13. You 
can choose to send the form automatically to Acrobat.com (this requires you to have an 
MAPI compliant client email) or save a local copy and manually send the form as an email 
attachment later. In this example I choose Save a local copy and manually send it later.

6. Click Next. You arrive at the last pane in the wizard. At the bottom of the wizard win-
dow a check box is checked by default as shown in Figure 35.14. If you keep the check-
box checked, email addresses of recipients are added to the Tracker to help you track the 
responses. If you don’t want to collect the recipient email addresses uncheck the check 
box. Do so means the form recipient will be prompted to add your email address when 
the form is submitted back to you.
 
7. Click Finish. Click the Finish button in the last wizard pane and the Tracker opens in 
Acrobat.
 FIGURE 35.14
Click Finish after completing all the steps to distribute the form.
 
8. Open the Original Form. When the Tracker opens, click the blue text where you see 
Open Original Form as shown in Figure 35.15.

(see Figure 35.16) that was automatically added by Acrobat.
 FIGURE 35.16

Acrobat Pro and Pro Extended users.

If you chose to add a submit button to a form and not use a wizard to distribute your form, you use a 
button action in the Actions tab for the Button Field Properties. From the Select Action pull-down 
menu you choose Submit a form and click the Add button. The Submit Form Selections dialog box 
opens where you find quite a few options for choosing what data are collected when a form is 
returned to you via email. Let’s take a look at all the options choices you have in this dialog box.
 Enter a URL for this link. If you have a data management system or a server product 
that routes data and manages a database, you can add a URL to the text box. This option 
requires you to have programming on your server that collects the data when it hits the 
URL specified in the text box. If you don’t have server-side programming to manage the 
data, your only other option is to add an email address, as shown in Figure 35.13.

1191
Working with Form Data

 Export Format. Along the left side of the dialog box you find several options for the type 
of export format users can send back to you.
 FDF Include. The FDF data is sent to the server. The three options below the FDF 
Include item offer you choices for sending the Field data; Comments, which includes 
any comments created on a form; and Incremental changes to the PDF, which should 
be used when digital signatures have been used to save updates. Any one or all of the 
selections can be made for this data type.
 HTML. The data is sent in HTML format as name/value pairs. Much as you might cre-
ate a form on a Web page using HTML and JavaScript, the HTML option processes the 
same data type.
 XFDF Include. The data are sent in XML format. Two options are available for send-
ing the Field data or the Comments data or both. You cannot submit digital signatures 
via XFDF.
 PDF The complete document. This option enables you to submit the PDF populated 
with the field data. This option is useful for Digital Signature workflows or for 
archiving the complete document. Additionally, if you use bar codes on forms, you’ll 
want to have the complete PDF document sent back to you.
 Field Selection. On the right side of the dialog box are options for including all or 
selected field data in your submission. If fields are to be eliminated, select the Only these 
button and then click the Select fields button. The Field Selection dialog box opens 
where you select which fields to use for the data export.
 Date Options. Dates are converted from the format specified on the form to standard 
date formats when the Date Options check box is enabled.
When the user clicks a Submit button, the form data from the choices you made in the dialog box 
are sent to the specified URL/email address. Keep in mind that if you do not have the necessary 
server-side programming, nothing happens to the data and it won’t be found on your server. You 
need intervention from the host to collect and route the data.
TIP
TIP
By default Acrobat doesn’t submit the value of a button field, so if you have a form 
containing button fields and you want to export the buttons data as well as the text 
field data, select the Only these radio button in the Submit Form Selections dialog box. The Field 
Selection dialog box opens after you click the Select Fields button. In the Field Selection dialog 
box, select the check boxes for all fields you want to submit.
Distributing forms via email
Deploying PDF forms in Acrobat 7 and earlier was limited to emailing PDFs and using the Submit 
button for users to mail data back to you. You had to deal with the data on a file-by-file basis with-
out any tools locally on your computer to merge data or display it in a single file source. What was 
left out of the loop was a method for aggregating data when users returned forms to you — that is, 
if you don’t have a server to manage data.

1192
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
Acrobat 8 helped bridge the gap for data collection with the introduction of PDF Packages. In 
Acrobat 8 you could distribute a form and collect forms that were appended to a PDF Package 
where the data could be exported to a CSV file and opened in Microsoft Excel. This development 
in Acrobat 8 was a huge step in helping forms authors collect data from forms fillers and analyze 
the data.
Inasmuch as we applauded Adobe for providing us with the new features in Acrobat 8, we still had 
one issue that remained a problem for forms authors who didn’t have sophisticated IT departments 
to set up servers where data could be collected. All the data collection for individual users and 
small businesses was dependent on email exchanges.
NEW FEATURE
NEW FEATURE
In Acrobat 9, Adobe hasn’t stepped forward in regard to data collection; 
rather, Adobe has leaped forward in huge bounds to help forms authors 
collect data. Without any need for complicated server configurations, you can now collect data 
on Acrobat.com, download your data for analysis, easily track forms, send reminders to users for 
filling out forms, and time limit your data collection.
The beauty of using a server to collect data is that you can have data collected and download the 
results when you have time to log on to your Acrobat.com workspace; you no longer have to 
depend on email collections piling up in your inbox. You can log on to Acrobat.com with a laptop 
while traveling, download recent responses, and keep up to date with a form collection process 
without having to log on to your email account.
Distributing forms in Acrobat 9 is handled in the Distribute Form wizard. When you distribute a 
form, you have three options in the wizard. You can collect form data on an internal server, manu-
ally collect data via email, and collect data via Acrobat.com. For data collection on your own inter-
nal server, I’ll refer you to the Acrobat Help document and the Adobe Web site to browse 
information related to internal server configurations. For starters take a look at the Web pages 
found at www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/.
Emailing forms using Adobe Acrobat
Distributing a form using the Distribute Form wizard for manually collecting email responses in 
your mailbox is handled via a menu command. Choose Forms ➪ Distribute Form to open the 
Distribute Form dialog box shown earlier in Figure 35.12. From the pull-down menu at the top of 
the wizard you have a choice listed as Manually collect responses in my email inbox. I covered 
manually distributing forms using your email inbox to collect data earlier in this chapter in the sec-
tion “Creating a Submit Form button.”
You have two choices for distributing a form to manually collect data in your email inbox. You can 
save a file and distribute it later like I explained in the section “Creating a Submit Form button” or 
you can use Acrobat to send the form now. When you choose Send it automatically using Adobe 
Acrobat (see Figure 35.13) Acrobat opens a default email message window as shown in Figure 35.17.

Analyzing data
When you collect forms from recipients a special distributed responses PDF Portfolio document 
collects the data. For forms distributed via email attachments you double-click a file attachment 
and the form data are added to your response file. This file is created automatically when you dis-
tribute a form. In Acrobat you see a welcome page in the PDF Portfolio response file like the one 
shown in Figure 35.18.
The Welcome Page has a list of items with descriptions. When you open the response file, a special 
set of tools are added to the left side of the Document pane. The items tasks you can perform with 
data collected from forms are shown in Table 35.1

with Acrobat.com.
The differences between Acrobat.com and emailing forms include:
 Distribute. The message you send to recipients contains a secure link to your form that 
recipients can access. You have a choice for allowing anyone who visits your Acrobat.com 
library to download the form, or you can choose to restrict access to only those whom 
you’ve invited to complete the form.
 Respond. In addition to enabling the form the same as email distributions, responses are 
encrypted when returned to you.
 Collect. Acrobat stores responses on your hard drive as the forms are returned to you. 
All the forms processing actions can be monitored in the Tracker.
When you choose Automatically download & organize responses with Acrobat.com and click the 
Next button in the wizard the Distribute Form log on dialog box opens as shown in Figure 35.25. 
If you have an Adobe ID, use your log on information and click the Sign In button. If you don’t 
have an Adobe ID, click the Create Adobe ID text you see in Figure 35.25.

For more information on creating an Adobe ID and setting up an account on 
Acrobat.com, see Chapter 29.
Once you log on to Acrobat.com the next screen you see is the Distribute Form email message 
window. Notice the difference in Figure 35.26 and the Distribute Form email message window 
shown earlier in Figure 35.17. In Figure 35.26 you see an option for Access Level. Since the file is 
going to be a hosted file, recipients need to download the file to fill in the form. When you submit 
the form you have an option to choose an Access Level. You can choose to permit anyone who vis-
its your Acrobat.com library to download the form or limit the access to only those recipients who 
receive an email from you.
Fill in the To addresses for you form recipients, edit any changes you want made in the Subject 
and Message fields, choose an Access Level and click Send. At this point Acrobat serves as your 
email client. The email message and attachment don’t ever see your email client. Everything is 
 handled by Acrobat which is the reason why you had to log on in the beginning of the process. 
Acrobat needs a connection before the form can be sent.
NOTE
NOTE
If you make changes in the Message text box in the Distribute Form email message 
window, be certain to not disturb the URL link that appears in the message as a 
default. This link is needed for recipients to download your file.

 FIGURE 35.26
Log on with your Adobe ID and the next screen you see is the Distribute Form email message window.
After Acrobat uploads the file, the Tracker opens as shown in Figure 35.27. Notice in the Tracker 
you see that you have similar information as shown in the Tracker in Figure 35.15. The Tracker 
shows you that the file was distributed to Acrobat.com and you see an additional item for Stop 
Collecting Data. When you click Stop Collecting data the form is closed so no additional data are 
uploaded to Acrobatc.com.
 FIGURE 35.27
The Tracker opens in Acrobat immediately after a form is submitted to Acrobat.com.

1202
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
When a recipient receives an email sent by Acrobat to the recipient email address and clicks the 
file attachment the recipient is taken to Acrobat.com. All recipients do not need an Acrobat.com 
account to access your file. The Acrobat.com window opens as shown in Figure 35.38. A recipient 
can download the form by clicking the Download button, fill in, and submit the form.
 FIGRUE 35.28
Recipients who arrive at your Acrobat.com workspace can click the Download button to download the 
form.
When forms are submitted to Acrobat.com you retrieve the form via the Tracker. Open the Tracker 
(Forms ➪ Track Forms) and click View Responses and the data are downloaded from Acrobat.com 
and added to your response file. The process for analyzing the data is the same as I covered earlier 
in this chapter in the section “Analyzing data.”

1203
Working with Form Data

Using the Tracker
If you have several forms distributed and you’re waiting on recipients to send back forms to you, 
things can quickly get a little disorganized and confusing. What you need is a management system 
to keep track of the forms currently being reviewed by recipients. In Acrobat 9 your management 
system is available in the Tracker that you can access in either Form Editing Mode or Viewer mode 
by choosing Forms ➪ Track Forms. When you choose this command, the Tracker opens as was 
shown earlier in Figure 35.15.
In the Tracker, you see a list of forms you either distributed to be filled out or forms you were 
asked to fill out by another user as shown in Figure 35.29.
 FIGURE 35.29
The left panel in the Tracker lists all forms you have distributed and received.
In the right pane you have several options for distributed forms and forms received from other 
PDF authors. At the top of the right pane you handle tasks related to distributed forms as shown in 
Figure 35.30.

1204
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 FIGURE 35.30
The top right pane in the Tracker is where you manage distributed forms.
Your choices in this section of the Tracker include:
 View Responses. Click the blue text to open the response file where you can view and 
analyze the response data.
 Edit file location. Click the blue text to open the Choose a new response file location 
dialog box. The location shown in the dialog box is the folder where your dataset file is 
located. If you want to change the file where the data are collected, you can browse your 
hard drive and select a new file. You can also use this dialog box to re-establish a link to 
the dataset file if you happen to relocate it on your computer.
 Stop Collecting Data. Clicking the blue text opens a dialog box, as shown in Figure 35.31, 
asking you to confirm the fact that you want to terminate data collection for the form. 
Click Yes, and the data collection stops. Any user attempting to submit data for the form 
is prevented from doing so. If you want to extend the form collection period, you need to 
start over and redistribute the form again.
 FIGURE 35.31
Click Yes to stop data collection on a form.
 Open Original Form. Clicking the blue text and the original form you distributed opens 
in the document pane.

The bottom right side of the Tracker handles responses for a distributed form as shown in 
Figure 35.32.
 FIGURE 35.32
The bottom right pane in the Tracker is where you manage responses.
Items you have to choose from within this section of the Tracker include:
 Email All Recipients. Click the blue text to send an email to all recipients of the distrib-
uted form. You might have an issue that needs some explanation and want to send a mail 
to all the recipients to clarify a point. When you send the mail, Acrobat acts as your mail 
client and sends the message (and a copy of the form again).
 Add Recipients. Click Add Recipients to include additional recipients to fill in the dis-
tributed form.
 Email Recipients Who Haven’t Responded. The Tracker maintains information on 
recipient responses and can filter those who haven’t responded. When you click the blue 
text, an email is sent to only those recipients who have not returned the form back to you.

Summary
 Acrobat offers a few preset calculation formulas used for calculating data. For more 
sophisticated calculations, you need to use Simplified Field Notation scripts and 
JavaScripts.
 When using hierarchical names, you can easily sum data by adding a parent name in the 
Calculate properties and selecting the sum (+) menu command.
 Form data can be exported from populated PDF forms in a variety of different file for-
mats. The data can be introduced into any form having matching field names as from 
where the data were exported.

1206
Acrobat PDF Forms
Part VI
 To ensure that fields have the same exact names between different forms, copy fields 
from one document and paste the fields in all other documents.
 Button fields can be created to submit form data from any Acrobat viewer. For Adobe 
Reader users to submit a PDF with data back to the PDF author, the form needs to be 
enabled with Adobe Reader usage rights.
 Data can be exported from a PDF document directly to a spreadsheet program.
 Forms can be distributed manually via email or directly using Acrobat.com.
 Forms in progress can be managed and organized in the Tracker.

priate for your computer.
NOTE
NOTE
Before you install Adobe Reader 9 on your computer, check out Adobe’s Web site 
at www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readermain.html to see if there’s a 
newer version of the Reader software than Adobe Reader 9.0, because you may have purchased 
this book after Adobe has updated the Reader software. If you find a version later than 9.0 on 
Adobe’s Web site, download that version.
PDF version of the book
The entire text of the Adobe Acrobat 9 PDF Bible is available on the CD as a PDF document. Any 
Acrobat viewer 7.0 and above can open the PDF file and view the contents. Look inside the PDF 
eBook folder to view a PDF portfolio of the Adobe Acrobat 9.0 PDF Bible.
To search the embedded index, open the Search panel by pressing Ctrl/Ô+Shift+F. When the

The Documents folder contains PDF documents and sample files to help you through some of the 
steps in the text of the book. The AuthorFiles folder contains four folders, which include:
 Chapters. When reviewing steps, open the chapter respective to the folder to see if a file 
exists to help you through the steps. For many steps in chapters, you can use any PDF 
document you want to follow the steps.

1209
What’s on the CD-ROM
 Forms Designs. Several original forms designs are contained in this folder in Adobe 
InDesign format. You need Adobe InDesign CS3 or greater to open the files. The PDF 
document exported from InDesign is also included in the respective folders.
 Forms Folder. Several different PDF forms are contained in this folder complete with 
JavaScripts.
 Video Files. Several Flash video files are contained in this folder and some sample Flash 
FLA files. In order to open the FLA files, you need Adobe Flash CS3 or greater.
An electronic brochure courtesy of Robert Connolly of pdfPictures.com (www.pdfPictures.com) 
and Aruba Bonbini is placed in the Chapter 22 folder inside the AuthorFiles/Chapters folder. 
This file is available for you to explore how dynamic content and pop-up menus are used in PDF 
files.
PDF forms eBook
An author-created eBook on 101 forms tips is included in the AuthorFiles/Chapters/

many JavaScripts and tips on using Acrobat and LiveCycle Designer for creating forms.
Bonus chapter
Chapter 36 — Understanding JavaScript is contained on the CD-ROM.
Author-created video files
Video files demonstrating many different features in Acrobat 9.0 are included in AuthorFiles/
Video Folder. These files are PDF documents with Adobe Flash–embedded content. All you 
need is Acrobat or Adobe Reader 9.0 to view the files.
In addition to the video files, some sample Adobe Flash FLV files are contained in the 
AuthorFiles/Video Files/FLV folder. You need Adobe Flash CS3 or above to open these 
files. If you’re not a Flash developer, these files show some simple Adobe Flash development. You 
can tear apart the files and see how they were constructed.
Troubleshooting
If you have difficulty installing or using any of the materials on the companion CD, try the follow-
ing solutions:
 Turn off any antivirus software that you may have running. Installers sometimes 
mimic virus activity and can make your computer incorrectly believe that it is being 
infected by a virus. (Be sure to turn the antivirus software back on later.)

1210
What’s on the CD-ROM
 Close all running programs. The more programs you’re running, the less memory is 
available to other programs. Installers also typically update files and programs; if you 
keep other programs running, installation may not work properly.
 Reference the ReadMe. Refer to the ReadMe file located at the root of the CD-ROM for 
the latest product information at the time of publication.
If you have trouble with the CD-ROM, call the Wiley Product Technical Support phone number at 
(800) 762-2974. Outside the United States, call 1(317) 572-3994. You can also contact Wiley 
Product Technical Support at http://support.wiley.com. John Wiley & Sons will provide 
technical support only for installation and other general quality-control items. For technical sup-
port on the applications themselves, consult the program’s vendor or author.
To place additional orders or to request information about other Wiley products, call 
(877) 762-2974.

ith JavaScript you can create dynamic documents for not only 
forms, but also many other uses such as adding interactivity to 
files, and viewing options, animation, and similar features not 
available with Acrobat tools. JavaScript helps you add flare and pizzazz to 
your PDF files. Now in Acrobat Standard 9 (Windows), you have access to 
all areas where JavaScripts can be written in Standard just like the Acrobat 
Pro users.
As the disclaimer I added in the introduction of this book and in Chapter 33 
as it applies to Adobe LiveCycle Designer, this book is not about JavaScript. 
It would take another book the size of Acrobat 9 PDF Bible to provide com-
plete coverage for all the JavaScript options you have in Acrobat. All I can 
hope to do in this chapter is provide a starting point in using JavaScript in 
Acrobat 9 and point you to sources where you can learn more. You can 
find much more on JavaScript in my PDF Forms Using Adobe Acrobat and 
LiveCycle Designer Bible (Wiley Publishing, 2008).
For more sophisticated uses and some sound reasoning for coding forms, 
look at the Acrobat JavaScript Scripting Reference and the Acrobat JavaScript 
Scripting Guide. Both documents are available from Adobe Systems by log-
ging on to www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/.
Setting Up the Environment
As described in Chapter 34, creating form fields, with the exception of the 
Button tool, requires you to enter Form Editing Mode. You also use the same 
tools used in Chapters 34 and 35 to handle form fields where you add 
JavaScripts. For setting up the Toolbar Well, refer to Chapter 34.

Understanding JavaScript
In addition to using form fields, you’ll use several menu commands related to writing JavaScripts. 
As you move through this chapter, the menu options related to accessing and writing JavaScripts 
are covered.
JavaScripts can be written using an internal editor in Acrobat or an external editor such as 
WordPad on Windows or TextEdit on the Macintosh. If you write a lot of JavaScript code, open 
the Preferences dialog box by pressing Ctrl/Ô+K. Click JavaScript in the left pane and in the 
JavaScript Editor area (or block or whatever) check the radio button for Use external JavaScript 
editor. Click the Browse button and locate the editor you want to use.
Getting Started with Acrobat JavaScript
Before I begin to explain some coding, let me start by making a few suggestions to the novice user 
who may find the programming aspects of Acrobat confusing and beyond your reach. For those 
who haven’t coded a single line, you can easily search and find samples of code used in Acrobat 
forms that you can copy and paste into your designs. Search the Internet and find PDF forms 
that are not secure, which enables you to examine the code using search terms like PDF forms, 
JavaScript, Sample Forms, etc. If, for example, you need a calculation for sales tax, search for one 
of the many examples of forms where a sales tax calculation is coded in a form field. You can copy 
and paste fields into your designs and often only need to change a variable name to make it work. 
Poke around and experiment and you’ll find some worthwhile routines in existing PDF forms.
Finding JavaScripts
As you peruse documents searching for JavaScripts either to paste into your own designs or to learn 
more about using JavaScript in Acrobat, you need to know where scripts are contained. You might 
copy and paste a script and find that the script doesn’t execute properly. One reason is that the script 
relies on a function contained in another area in the document. Therefore, to gain a complete under-
standing of how a form works, you need to examine all the potential containers for scripts. As a mat-
ter of practice, you’ll want to examine several areas in a form where JavaScripts are found.
TIP
TIP
If you want a quick glance at JavaScripts contained in a document, select 
Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Edit All JavaScripts. The JavaScript Editor 
opens and displays all JavaScripts in the document in a scrollable window.
JavaScripts can be contained in the following areas in a PDF document:
 Form Fields. Depending on the field type, you’ll find JavaScripts in various tabs in the 
Field Properties dialog box. For text fields you can find scripts in the Format, Validate, 
and Calculate tabs. Other field types can have scripts contained in tabs specific to the 
field type.
 Bookmarks. JavaScripts can be contained in the Bookmarks Properties in the Actions tab.

BC3
Understanding JavaScript
 Links. Links can have JavaScripts in the Link Properties in the Actions tab.
 Page Actions. JavaScripts can be added to Page Open and Page Close actions.
 Document Level JavaScripts. JavaScript Functions can be added at the document level.
 Document Actions. Document Actions such as saving a file or printing a file can have 
JavaScripts applied when the action is invoked.
TIP
TIP
If you have form fields in a PDF form, you don’t need to enter Form Editing Mode 
to add or change a JavaScript on form field objects. Use the Select Object tool and 
double-click or open a context menu on a field and choose Properties. The form object’s 
Properties dialog box can be opened without entering Form Editing Mode.
Examining form field scripts
The most frequent use of JavaScript in Acrobat forms is when scripts are written for field actions. 
To examine JavaScripts associated with fields, select the Select Object tool and open the Field 
Properties. Depending on the field type, there may be several places where a script can be located. 
The first logical place to look is the Actions tab. Actions can contain JavaScripts for all field types. 
Click the Actions tab to see what actions are assigned to the field, as shown in Figure 36.1.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on the different field types in Acrobat 9, see Chapter 34.
 FIGURE 36.1
Click the Actions tab to see whether a JavaScript action has been added to the field.
If you see JavaScript assigned to a mouse behavior, click on Run a JavaScript in the Actions list and 
click the Edit button. Acrobat opens the JavaScript Editor and displays the code written for the 
script, as shown in Figure 36.2. The code in the JavaScript Editor can be copied from one field and 
pasted into the editor when you assign a script to another field. In addition, the field can be copied 
and pasted into another form. When you paste fields with JavaScript in them, the code is preserved 
in the pasted field.

BC17
Understanding JavaScript
If/else statements
If/else statements are used for conditional items. For example, if one condition is true, do some-
thing; otherwise, do something else. A good use for an if/else statement might be eliminating zeros 
in calculation fields. By default, zeros appear in calculation fields as shown in Figure 36.15. To 
clear the fields of zeros, you can use an if/else statement.
 FIGURE 36.15
A default appearance for calculation fields shows zeros according to the number format selected in the 
Format properties.
On this form, the total fields are calculated by multiplying the quantity by the fixed unit price. If 
the total value is zero, we want to display the field without any value else we want to display the 
calculated value. Here’s the code that eliminates the zeros when the field contents are greater 
than zero.
1. var f=this.getField(“quantity”);
2. var g=this.getField(“unit”);
3. if (f.value!=0)
4. event.value=f.value * g.value;
5. else
6. event.value=””;
The default for the quantity field is zero and stays that way until a user adds a quantity for pur-
chasing an item. The Unit column contains default values. Therefore, we look at the Quantity field. 
If the value is not zero, we want the value reported in the Total field. The else statement reports 
that if the quantity is zero we add nothing to the field (two quote marks with no space between the 
quotes).

BC4
Understanding JavaScript
 FIGURE 36.2
Select JavaScript in the Actions tab and click the Edit button. The JavaScript Editor dialog box opens, 
displaying the code.
With Text and Combo Box fields you can find JavaScripts in the Actions properties as well as the 
Format, Validate, and Calculate properties. If you are examining a form to understand how the field 
actions are executed, be certain to select each of these tabs to see whether any custom formatting or 
validation is used. Click the Format tab and look for Custom selected in the Select format category 
pull-down menu, as shown in Figure 36.3. If a JavaScript appears in either the Custom Format Script 
window or the Custom Keystroke Script window, click the Edit button adjacent to where the script is 
written. The JavaScript Editor opens in which you can edit the script or copy the text.
The Validate properties offer the same options. Follow the same procedures for finding JavaScripts 
as described earlier in this section by clicking the Validate tab and clicking Edit where you see a 
JavaScript in the Run custom validation script window to open the JavaScript Editor dialog box.
Field calculations are often handled in the Calculate properties. When JavaScript produces data 
calculations, be certain to examine the Calculate properties, as shown in Figure 36.4. However, not 
all field calculations are assigned to the Calculate properties, so be certain to check the Actions 
properties as well as Calculate in the event a calculation is performed on an action.
List Boxes offer different properties. If a List Box is used, click the Selection Change tab. A 
JavaScript can execute when a selection in the List Box changes. If a script appears in the dialog 
box, click the Edit button to open the JavaScript Edit dialog box.
Digital signatures can also be assigned custom JavaScripts. Click the Signed tab for a Digital 
Signature field and examine the dialog box for a custom script.

BC5
Understanding JavaScript
 FIGURE 36.3
Select the Format tab and click Edit to see a script appear in the dialog box.
Buttons, Radio Buttons, and Check Boxes can have JavaScripts added only to the Actions proper-
ties. When opening these field types, click the Actions tab described earlier.
Barcode fields can also contain JavaScripts. The Value tab in the Barcode Properties contains an area 
where you can add custom JavaScripts similar to scripts you add in the Format and Validate tabs.
 FIGURE 36.4
Click the Calculate tab to see whether a custom calculation script has been added to the field. If a script 
appears in the dialog box, click Edit to open the JavaScript Editor dialog box.

BC6
Understanding JavaScript
Bookmarks and links
Both Bookmarks and links use the same action types as form fields. You might use a Bookmark for 
navigating documents rather than creating form field buttons or links on every page to open and 
close files. When the Bookmarks tab is open, users can click on a Bookmark to open secondary 
files or perform other actions such as spawning pages from templates.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on Button Field Properties, see Chapter 22.
To check for JavaScripts contained in Bookmark actions, open the Bookmark Properties dialog box 
and click the Actions tab. JavaScripts are listed the same as when examining actions for form fields 
(described in the preceding section). Likewise, when you open Link Properties, you can check to 
see whether a JavaScript has been added as a Link action.
Examining document-level JavaScripts
You may copy a field and paste it into another document and find an error reported when 
 executing the JavaScript action. Notwithstanding variable names that are explained later, you 
can experience problems like this because the routine in the JavaScript might be calling a 
JavaScript function or global action that was contained in the original document as a document-
level JavaScript. Among your tasks in dissecting a form should be an examination of any docu-
ment-level JavaScripts. To find document-level JavaScript functions contained in a form, choose 
Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Document JavaScripts and the JavaScript Functions dialog 
box opens, as shown in Figure 36.5.
In the JavaScript Functions dialog box, search for any names in the box below the Script Name 
box. All document-level functions are listed in this dialog box. To examine a script, select the 
script name and click the Edit button. The JavaScript Editor window, in which you can examine 
and/or copy the script, opens.
Writing functions and accessing them in JavaScript code written for field actions is much more 
complex. If you are new to JavaScript you may want to start with simple scripts in form fields until 
you learn more about how JavaScript is coded and implemented in Acrobat. As you learn more, 
you can develop more sophisticated routines that include functions.
Examining page actions
Page actions execute when a user opens or closes a PDF page. You can assign any action type avail-
able from the Select Action types for field actions, including Run a JavaScript. When examining 
forms, open the Page Properties dialog box by opening a context menu in the Pages tab and select-
ing Properties. Click on Actions when the Page Properties dialog box opens. If a JavaScript or any 
other page action is assigned to either the Page Open or the Page Close action, the action types are 
listed in the Actions window. Notice in Figure 36.6 that both a Page Open and Page Close action 
appear in the Actions window showing Run a JavaScript for both page actions.

Understanding JavaScript
Examining document actions
Document actions execute JavaScripts for any one of five different Acrobat functions. On a docu-
ment close, during a save, after a save, during a print, or after a print, a JavaScript action can be 
executed. To view any document actions assigned to the PDF document, choose 
Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Set Document Actions.

Actions” later in this chapter.
The Document Actions dialog box opens. If a JavaScript is assigned to a document action, an icon 
appears adjacent to the action type. You can view a script in the dialog box, as shown in Figure 36.7, 
or you can open the JavaScript Editor window by selecting the action name and clicking Edit.
 FIGURE 36.7
Any document actions assigned to the PDF are displayed with a green circle adjacent to an action type in 
the Document Actions dialog box.
Searching for page templates
Although not a JavaScript action, page templates can be called upon by JavaScript routines or addi-
tional fields can be created from template pages. Because templates can be hidden, the only way to 
examine JavaScripts on template pages is to first display a hidden template. As a matter of routine, 
you should search for page templates when examining forms.
The command for accessing page templates in Acrobat has been tossed back and forth between dif-
ferent menus from one version to the other. If you’re coming from Acrobat 8 land, your first incli-
nation is to search the Forms menu. It’s not there. You then might try to enter Forms Edit mode,

Understanding JavaScript
and again you won’t find a Page Templates button or menu command. In Acrobat 9, the Page 
Templates menu command has been moved to the Document Processing submenu.
To display a hidden template, choose Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Page Templates. If a 
Page Template is used in the PDF file, a template name appears in a list box in the Page Templates 
dialog box. If the Page Template is hidden, the square adjacent to the template name appears 
empty. To show the template page, click on the icon adjacent to the template name. The icon 
changes to an eye icon inside the square. In Figure 36.8, you see four templates listed in the Page 
Templates dialog box. Two templates are visible and two templates are hidden.
 FIGURE 36.8
Clicking on the icon to the left of a template name for hidden templates makes the template visible in 
the PDF.

The template likely appears at the end of the document. After you make a template visible, click 
the GoTo button to navigate to that page. If form fields or links are on the page, you can open 
them and examine them for JavaScripts.
Using the JavaScript Debugger
All of the aforementioned JavaScript locations can also be found in the JavaScript Debugger. The 
JavaScript Debugger dialog box enables you to examine JavaScripts from a list in the Scripts win-
dow. Press Ctrl/Ô+J or select Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ JavaScript Debugger to open 
the dialog box shown in Figure 36.9. Select an item in the list and click the arrows to open scripts 
nested in a hierarchical order. When you select the script, the code is shown in the View window.

BC10
Understanding JavaScript
At the top of the hierarchy in the Scripts window, you’ll see all the scripts associated with different 
actions. Click the right-pointing arrow to expand a listed item. You can expand individual items 
until you arrive at the action. Select the action, and the code for the item is listed in the lower View 
window when you select either Script or Script and Console from the pull-down menu options.
The JavaScript Debugger also helps you debug scripts you write. You can set break points that halt 
routines to help narrow down bugs in your code. To set a break point, click on the left side of each 
line of code where you want a break to occur. A red circle appears after you set a break point.
 FIGURE 36.9
Press Ctrl/Ô+J to open the JavaScript Debugger window.
Using the JavaScript Console
The JavaScript Console is a part of the same dialog box where you find the JavaScript Debugger. In 
the console window you can type a line of code to test it for errors, or you can copy code from a 
field and paste it into the console window. To execute a segment in a routine, select the segment to 
be tested and press the Num Pad Enter key (or press Ctrl+Enter).
You can also execute a statement by placing the cursor at the beginning of the line to be executed. 
Press the Enter key on the Num Pad and the routine runs. In Figure 36.10, you see a line of code 
in the Console in the background. When I press the Num Pad Enter key (or Ctrl/Ctrl+Enter) with 
the cursor anywhere on a line or select several lines of code, the code executes. In this example, an 
alert dialog box opens as you see in the foreground.

When testing code in the JavaScript Console, click in a line of code or select several 
lines of code and press the Num Pad Enter key. If you press the Enter/Return key, 
you’ll add a paragraph return in the console window. If text is selected, the text is deleted when 
pressing Enter/Return.
Be certain to check the Preferences dialog box when using the JavaScript Debugger and Console. 
Open the Preferences dialog box and click on JavaScript in the left pane. On the right side of the 
dialog box are options for enabling the Debugger and the Console. Be certain these items are 
enabled before you begin editing scripts.
Creating Viewer Options Warning Alerts
Under some circumstances, it is helpful for users to know the limitations of completing your forms 
before they attempt filling in data fields. If users open your forms in Adobe Reader, they cannot 
save the data after filling in the form unless the form is enabled with Adobe Reader usage rights. In 
other cases, some scripts you add to a form cannot be performed in Adobe Reader. Some examples 
of such scripts might be transposing data to other forms or spawning a page from a template. 
These actions require Acrobat. Additionally, new features in Acrobat 9 make some actions unus-
able for users with viewers earlier than Acrobat 7. Therefore, you may want to assess the viewer 
type and viewer version when a user opens your forms. If a version or viewer type cannot be used 
with the form you created, you can alert the user immediately when the file opens.

BC12
Understanding JavaScript
Creating viewer type alerts
A viewer type is the Acrobat viewer used to view the PDF form. Adobe Reader, Acrobat Standard, 
and Acrobat Pro and Acrobat Pro Extended are the viewer types that are used in filling out PDF 
forms. Certain actions you add to buttons, page actions, bookmarks, and so on may not be sup-
ported by Adobe Reader. To be certain the Reader user is aware that the PDF has limitations and 
needs to be viewed in Acrobat Standard or Pro or Pro Extended, you can add a JavaScript with a 
viewer type alert. When the PDF is opened in Adobe Reader, an alert dialog box opens if the file 
is opened in Reader with a message informing the Reader user that the PDF can’t be used in the 
Reader application. If the file is opened in an Acrobat product, the dialog box doesn’t open.
To see how you add this type of JavaScript to a document, follow these steps:
STEPS: Adding viewer type alerts
 
1. Open the JavaScript Functions dialog box. Open a PDF and select Advanced ➪ Document 
Processing ➪ Document JavaScripts to open the JavaScript Functions dialog box. The location 
for this JavaScript is important. By adding a JavaScript at the document level, the JavaScript is 
run when the document opens before the first page is displayed. If the viewer type is Adobe 
Reader, the JavaScript displays a message. All other viewers ignore this message.
 
2. Name the JavaScript function. Type a name for the script in the Script Name text box in 
the JavaScript Functions dialog box. For this script I use a name such as viewerType, as 
shown in Figure 36.11.
 FIGURE 36.11
Open the JavaScript Functions dialog box and type a name for your new script.
 
3. Open the JavaScript Editor. After typing a name for your script, click the Add button 
and the JavaScript Editor window opens.
 
4. Add a JavaScript. Enter the following code in the JavaScript Editor dialog box:
1. //is Reader (as opposed to Acrobat)
2. if (typeof(app.viewerType)!=”undefined”)
3. if(app.viewerType == “Reader”)
4. {

BC13
Understanding JavaScript
5.  var msg = “Filling out this form requires use of Acrobat 
Standard, Acrobat Pro or Acrobat Pro Extended.”;
6.  app.alert(msg);
7. }
NOTE
NOTE
The preceding line numbers are for clarification only. The line numbers are not 
included in the code you write in the JavaScript Editor. The code, as it is written in 
the JavaScript Editor, appears as shown in Figure 36.12.
 
 The // at the beginning of a line of code is a programmer’s comment. The code is not 
executed. In line 2, the if statement assesses the viewer. If the viewer type in line 3 is 
equal (==) to Adobe Reader (“Reader”), then an alert dialog box opens — line 6: 
app.alert(msg). The variable msg is defined in the line 5 var msg statement. 
Therefore, the variable msg value appears when the alert dialog box opens. If the viewer 
type is not Reader, the warning dialog box does not open.
 FIGURE 36.12
Actual code in the JavaScript Editor does not include line numbers. Numbers are used 
in this chapter to help describe the lines of code.
 
5. Copy the script. Press Ctrl/Ô+A to select all and press Ctrl/Ô+C to copy the text to the 
Clipboard. The text will remain on the Clipboard until you copy something else. We’ll 
use this script to test it in the JavaScript Debugger later.
 
6. Click OK in the JavaScript editor. You return to the JavaScript Functions dialog box 
where your code is partially shown, as you can see in Figure 36.13.

BC14
Understanding JavaScript
 FIGURE 36.13
Click OK in the JavaScript Editor and you return to the JavaScript Functions dialog box.
 
7. Click OK in the JavaScript Functions dialog box.
 
8. Save the file. Select File ➪ Save or File ➪ Save As and save the file.
 
9. Open the JavaScript Debugger. You can’t test the entire script in Acrobat because the 
viewer type is Acrobat and not Reader, but you can take a look at the dialog box a Reader 
user will see before you test the script in Reader. Viewing the alert dialog box can help 
you find any text errors.
 
10. Paste the Clipboard text in the JavaScript Debugger. Press Ctrl/Ô+J to open the 
JavaScript Debugger window. Click the Trash icon to remove any text in the Console. 
Press Ctrl/Ô+V to paste the Clipboard text.
 
11. Test the script. Drag the cursor through the text beginning with var msg and continu-
ing through (msg): in the second to last line. Press the Num Pad Enter key on your 
keyboard and the alert dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 36.14.
 FIGURE 36.14
Select the text to test and press the Num Pad Enter key on your keyboard to open the 
application alert dialog box.

BC15

12. Test the file in Adobe Reader. To test the entire script and make sure it works properly, 
open the file in Adobe Reader. When the file opens, you should see the alert dialog 
box open.
Creating viewer version alerts
You may create JavaScripts to perform actions that are not available in earlier versions of Acrobat. 
The newer Acrobat 9 implementation of JavaScript adds more statements and reserved words than 
earlier versions. If it is essential for a user to complete your form in Acrobat 9, you can add a page 
action and inform the user in an alert dialog box that Acrobat 9 is needed to complete the form. 
Follow these steps to assess the viewer version:
STEPS: Create a viewer version alert
 
1. Create a JavaScript Function. Follow the same steps as creating a viewer type alert. 
Name the script viewerVersion and click the Add button in the JavaScript Functions 
 dialog box to open the JavaScript Editor.
 
2. Add a JavaScript. Type the following code in the JavaScript Editor:
1. if (typeof(app.viewerVersion)!=”undefined”)
2. if(app.viewerVersion < 9.0)
3. {
4. var msg = “Not all features in this document work in Acrobat 
viewers lower than version 9.0. Upgrade to Adobe Acrobat 9 
Standard  Pro or Pro Extended on Windows or Adobe Acrobat 9 
Pro  on the Macintosh before proceeding.”;
5. app.alert(msg);
 
 In line 2, app.viewerVersion is used instead of the viewer type noted in the earlier 
example. This routine assesses the current Acrobat viewer version and displays the mes-
sage in line 4 if the viewer version is less than Acrobat 9.0.
TIP
TIP
If you’re new to JavaScript and you can’t seem to remember the code, add both 
functions to a file. You can use the File ➪ Create PDF ➪ From Blank Page command 
to create a blank new page and add both scripts as Document JavaScripts in your blank docu-
ment. Add a comment note on the blank page noting the scripts contained in the document. 
Save the file and add the file in your Organizer in a collection you create for JavaScripts. The next 
time you need one of the scripts, open the Organizer and locate the file. Open it and copy the 
script you want to use. Paste the script in a new document and it’s ready to go.
Performing JavaScript Calculations
Acrobat provides only a few basic math operations. In the Calculate tab for a text or combo box 
field, you can choose to sum values or get a product using built-in Acrobat functions. If you want 
subtraction or division or any other math operations, you need to use one of the two scripting 
 languages — Simplified Field Notation or JavaScript.

BC16
Understanding JavaScript
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on the built-in math functions in Acrobat, see Chapter 34.
To subtract values using Simplified Field Notation, open the Calculate tab in a text or combo box 
field Properties dialog box and select Simplified Field Notation. Click the Edit button and type the 
following code:
1. total - discount
In the previous script, a field named discount is subtracted from a field named total. To calculate 
the same result using JavaScript, click the Custom calculation script radio button in the Calculate 
tab in the Properties dialog box and click Edit. In the JavaScript Editor, add the following code:
1. var f=this.getField(“total”);
2. var g = this.getField(“discount”);
3. event.value=f.value – g.value;
To divide a field named apples by a field named baskets using Simplified Field Notation, use the 
following script:
1. apples / baskets
To perform the same calculation using JavaScript, use the following code:
1. var f=this.getField(“apples”);
2. var g = this.getField(“baskets”);
3. event.value = f.value / g.value;
Sales tax is a common calculation required on many forms. Assuming you have one field for a sub-
total and another for a grand total, open the grandTotal field and use the following code to calcu-
late a sales tax using Simplified Field Notation.
1. subtotal *.0725
For calculating a sales tax using JavaScript, the calculation formula would be:
1. var f=this.getField(“subTotal”);
2. event.value=Math.round(f.value*7.25)/100;
The variable name f gets the contents of the subtotal field. The second line of code performs 
the calculation for variable f to compute sales tax for a tax rate of 7.25 percent. If you want to 
duplicate the code for one of your forms, change the tax rate accordingly.
In these examples you can quickly see that Simplified Field Notation is a much easier scripting lan-
guage to work with. Many different math functions are supported with Simplified Field Notation. 
When you need to add other functions such as creating if/else statements or using loops, then your 
only choice is JavaScript.

BC18
Understanding JavaScript
Calculating dates
You can add a date to a form with a simple JavaScript. To add a date to a form, create a text field. 
Set the attributes for the text appearance and font in the Appearance tab and click the Calculate 
tab. Add a JavaScript action and enter the following code:
1. var d = new Date();
2. console.println(util.printd(“mmmm dd, yyyy”, d));
In the preceding example, the date is reported in the format like January 27, 2009 (or whatever the 
current date may be). You can change date formats by editing the text within quotes. For example, 
change the text to read “mmm dd, yyyy”, and the date is reported in the format Jul 04, 2009. 
Change the date to “mm/dd/yy” and the date reads 9/24/09.
The date appears in the date field when you open the PDF document. When you open a PDF doc-
ument on another day, the date changes to reflect the current date. In some instances, you may 
want the date reported on the day a page was created and not have the date change each time the 
document opens in Acrobat. You can combine a script to create the date with, for example, spawn-
ing a page from a template and adding a new date field as the new page is created. (For more on 
spawning pages from templates, see the section “Spawning a page from a template” later in this 
chapter.)
In the next example we want to use a JavaScript to create a new field and add a date to the field. 
Here’s how you do it:
STEPS: Add a new date field to a page
 
1. Add a button to a page. To test the script, we’ll add a button so when you click the but-
ton you can see the result. If you add a date field to a page in conjunction with another 
action such as spawning a page from a template, you would include the script along with 
the script used to spawn a page.
 
2. Open the JavaScript Editor. Use the same action as covered in previous examples to add 
a JavaScript action to a button.
 
3. Type the script in the JavaScript Editor. The following code creates a new field and 
adds a date value to the field:
1.   var r = [550, 765, 600, 785];
2.   var i = this.numPages-1
3.   var f = this.addField(“myDate”,”text”,i,r);
4. f.textSize = 12;
5.  f.alignment = “right”;
6.  f.textColor = color.black;
7.  f.fillColor = color.transparent;
8.  f.textfont = font.HelvB;
9. f.borderStyle = border.s;
10 f.strokeColor = color.transparent;
11 f.value = util.printd(“mm/dd/yy”, new Date());

BC19
Understanding JavaScript
 
4. Click OK in the JavaScript Editor and click Close in the Button Field Properties dia-
log box.
 
5. Test the script. Click the button with the Hand tool. You should see the field added to 
the last page in the document.
In Step 3, the first line of code sets a variable to the coordinates (in points) for where the field rect-
angle will be drawn. In this example the field is drawn in the top right corner on a standard por-
trait letter size page. Line 2 sets a variable to the last page in the document (remember JavaScript is 
zero based so the total number of pages minus 1 is the last page in the document). Line 3 is the 
addField statement adding a “text” field named myDate and using the page number (i) and the 
field coordinates (r).
Lines 4 through 10 set the attributes for the field for alignment, text color, field appearance, and 
so on. The last line of code creates the date field. When the field is created, it’s a date stamp that 
won’t change when the document is opened on a different date.
Using loops
For summing columns of data, you can use the sum + preset formulas where you need results at 
the end of a column or row. However, at times, summing column or row data with a JavaScript is 
necessary. You might have a need to multiply an item by a quantity for a subtotal, and then add all 
the subtotals together to create a grand total. In another situation you might have a form that sums 
a column of numbers and calculates a sales tax after summing the fields like the example shown in 
Figure 36.16. In Figure 36.16 the total fields are summed and a sales tax is added to the total in 
the grand total field at the bottom of the far right column. For summing data in columns, you need 
to create a loop that loops through all the fields used in the calculation.
 FIGURE 36.16
A total field is calculated and a sales tax computed in the same result field.

BC20
Understanding JavaScript
For a simple loop to calculate a row of data, use the following example:
1. var f = this.getField(“totalItem”);
2. var a = f.getArray();
3. var result=0.0;
4. for (i=0; i<a.length; i++) result += a[i].value;
5. event.value = result;
Line 1 assigns the variable f to a parent name totalItem. The fields in a column are named 
totalItem.0, totalItem.1, totalItem.2, totalItem.3, and so on. Line 2 assigns the variable a to an 
array. Line 3 sets the variable result to zero. Line 4 begins the loop and the loop continues through 
the length of the array summing the result value. Line 5 places the end result value in the field.
Using Document Actions
Document actions are actions from JavaScript routines that are implemented when a file is printed, 
saved, or closed. Rather than using a button to execute an action, Acrobat executes the action dur-
ing one of five document conditions. A document action is executed when a file is closed, when a 
file is saved, after a file is saved, when a file is printed, and after a file is printed. There are many 
uses for executing actions on one of the document action items. You might want to delete unused 
fields on a form, delete all page templates, or perhaps offer a message to the user after a form has 
been saved or printed.
As an example, suppose forms need to be completed in an Acrobat viewer and then printed and 
routed by hand. You can provide instructions on what to do with the form after it finishes printing. 
In this case, you can set up a document action after a file has finished printing. You are assured the 
user sees the message because the form needs to be printed as the last step in completing the form.
Follow these steps for creating an alert dialog box with a message to instruct a user what to do with 
a form after it has printed:
STEPS: Create a document action showing an alert dialog box
 
1. Open the Document Actions dialog box. Open a PDF file and choose 
Advanced ➪ Document Processing  ➪ Set Document Actions. The Document Actions dia-
log box opens.
 
2. Select the Document Did Print action type. Select one of the five items in the list box 
for the type of action to be used. In this example, I’ll use Document Did Print as the 
action type.
 
3. Open the JavaScript Editor. Click Edit in the Document Actions dialog box. The 
JavaScript Editor dialog box opens.
 
4. Code the script. Enter the following code:
app.alert(“Please submit the printed form to the accounting In 
box in the main office complex.”,3)

5. Exit the JavaScript Editor. Click OK in the JavaScript Editor. You return to the 
Document Actions dialog box where your code appears when the action is selected, as 
shown in Figure 36.17.

6. Print the form. Print the document to your desktop printer. After the PDF finishes print-
ing, the dialog box opens.

Working with Page Templates
One very useful tool available to you with page templates and JavaScript is the ability to create new 
pages from a template page. You can make templates either visible or hidden in your forms. You 
create new pages from template pages by spawning a page from a template. The spawned pages are 
duplicates of the template pages, but any fields on spawned pages are created with new field names 
if desired. The scripts and actions for fields added to template pages are duplicated when you 
spawn pages from templates. The only changes that occur are field names, so each field in your 
new document contains unique field names if desired.

BC22
Understanding JavaScript
Page templates can be spawned to create new pages or you can also use page templates to overlay 
data on existing pages. For example, a watermark, graphic, text, and so on, as you might add with 
headers and footers, can be overlaid on pages using page templates.
Creating page overlays was once a very much needed feature in earlier versions of Acrobat, but now 
with Acrobat’s more powerful tools for creating headers and footers, the need to overlay pages using 
JavaScripts is more limited to conditional responses from a user who clicks a button action. For 
example, if the answer is yes, some content is added to a page from a template. If the answer is no, 
then either no page is spawned from a template or maybe a different page is spawned. However, for 
adding overlays to pages such as watermarks, headers, footers, page numbers, and so on, you’ll find 
using the Add Header and Add Footer dialog boxes a better solution. For adding pages to a PDF, 
the spawn object is used (spawnPageFromTemplate in older versions of Acrobat).
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on creating headers and footers, see Chapter 16.
Creating a page template
To create a page template, open a PDF form in which you want to convert one of the pages to a tem-
plate. You may have a form where a given user response requires more information, and as a result, a 
new page is created in the document. You might have a file that creates a summary page after calcu-
lating data and the new page is dynamically created with a JavaScript. In another scenario, you might 
have a document you use for personal record keeping such as a date book, a file organizer, or some 
other kind of personal data management tool. In these examples, you need to frequently add new 
pages in a document to add more data. Creating new pages is easily handled by adding a JavaScript 
to spawn a page from a template. To write such a script, you first need to create a page template.
A page template is a page in a PDF file that you define as a Page Template. You can use an existing 
page in a document you export to PDF in an authoring program or create a separate PDF docu-
ment you design for a template and later insert the page in a PDF file.
CROSS-REF
CROSS-REF
For more information on inserting pages in PDF files, see Chapter 16.
In Figure 36.18, I created a page I want to use as a template and inserted the page in a PDF file. 
The idea behind this page is to use a form to organize my passwords. Each time I acquire a new 
password for accessing Web sites or documents, I add the pertinent data in my passwords file. 
Since I’m always adding new passwords, I need to continually create new pages in the PDF file.
To create a Page template, follow these steps.
STEPS: Creating a page template
 
1. Insert a page in a PDF file or use one of the existing pages in a file you want to use 
as a page template.
 
2. Navigate to the page you want to use for your page template.

Form Editing button. Test all fields to make sure they work properly. In Figure 36.18, I 
added a number of fields to my template page.
NOTE
NOTE
Alternately, you can stay in Form Editing Mode and click the Preview button to test 
field scripts.

Templates and the Page Templates dialog box opens.
 
6. Type a name for your template. Type a name in the Name text box.
 
7. Add the page as a Page Template. Click the Add button and Acrobat prompts you in a 
dialog box to confirm adding the page in view in the Document pane as a page template. 
Click Yes and you return to the Page Templates dialog box.

NOTE
You must have at least one page visible in a PDF. You cannot create a page template 
and hide it if the page template is the only page in the document.
Spawning a page from a template
To create new pages from your template, create a button on the page from which you want the 
user to spawn a new page. Either a link button or form field can be used. In the link or button 
properties dialog box, select Run a JavaScript as the action type.
The following code is used to spawn a page from a template.
1. var a = this.getTemplate(“passwords”);
2. a.spawn ({
3.  nPage:this.numPages,
4.  bRename:true,
5.  bOverlay:false
6. })

BC25
Understanding JavaScript
The template name I used is passwords as defined in the first line of code. This is the exact same 
name as you type in the Page Templates dialog box when you create the page template. In the 
 second line of code, the instruction a.spawn spawns a page from a template. Lines 3 to 5 set the 
attributes for the spawned page. In line 3, the spawned page is placed after the last page in the 
document. You can change the value this.numPages to a page number and place the spawned 
page anywhere in the file. In line 4, any fields contained on the template page are renamed on the 
spawned page to provide unique field names. If the line is changed to bRename:false, all fields 
are duplicated with duplicate field names. In line 5, the code instructs Acrobat to create a new 
page in the document. If you change the code to bOverlay:true, the spawned page is superim-
posed over the last page in the file.
Lines 3 through 5 in the preceding script are default values. If you write the script as follows, 
Acrobat assumes using the defaults without specific notation for the attributes:
1. var a = this.getTemplate(“passwords”);
2. a.spawn();
This two-line script works fine in Acrobat 6 through 9; however, there are problems executing the 
script properly in earlier versions of Acrobat. Be certain to use the script with six lines of code and 
specify all attributes of the spawned page, and you can be certain the script works in all versions 
of Acrobat.
You can also use an action type to instruct Acrobat to go to the newly created page. By default, 
spawned pages are created at the end of the PDF document. When pages are spawned, the page 
containing the button used to spawn a new page remains in view. To help a user navigate to the 
new spawned page, you can add another line of code to go to the new page. Add the following 
script after the last line of code used to spawn a page:
this.pageNum = this.numPages-1;
This line assesses the number of pages in the document, subtracts one from the number, and 
opens the last page. JavaScript is zero based; therefore, the –1 item subtracts one from the total 
number of pages. In JavaScript terms, page 1 is page 0.
TIP
TIP
If you have a document with many pages and need to spawn pages periodically as the 
user browses the document, use a Bookmark instead of adding buttons on all the 
pages. A single Bookmark takes up much less memory than button fields added to every page.
You can also add buttons on the template page to spawn pages from a template. In my passwords 
file, it would be cumbersome to always travel back to the first page to click a button that spawns a 
page. To make it much easier, I created a button on the template page to spawn additional pages. 
This way I can search through my document to see if I have an existing password already created 
for a given Web site. If not, no matter where I am in the document I can create a new page and 
add the new password.

Creating Pop-Up Menus
Application pop-up menus can be useful for nesting action items so you can save some space on a 
form. You might want to have a contents page where a user navigates via menu commands to 
many different files stored on a CD-ROM or network server. Rather than listing all files on a page 
or in Bookmarks, you can categorize groups and nest them in submenus for a more economical 
use of space.
As an example, suppose you want to create links to other PDF documents. You have a small page 
and don’t have enough room to display all the titles of the documents you want the user to access. 
By creating an application pop-up menu like the one shown in Figure 36.20, you can create cate-
gories, subcategories, and links to destinations that assist users in opening files in a relatively small 
section on a contents page.
 FIGURE 36.20
By adding application pop-up menus, you can create lists of destination documents in categorical groups.
When you select the menu option, the file associated with the link opens in the Document pane. 
Additionally, you can create application pop-up menus to navigate pages within a document. In 
Figure 36.21, you can see where a pop-up menu helps out nicely. Designer and Acrobat expert 
Robert Connolly of pdfPictures.com creates electronic brochures that are viewed in Full Screen 
mode. To access the huge number of links within the documents while keeping the page design 
neat and attractive, Bob uses nested pop-up application menus that link to other page views, play 
video files, print, and navigate the document. To see some examples of the attractive eBrochures 
designed by Robert Connolly, log on to www.pdfPictures.com where you can download some 
nicely assembled PDF electronic brochures and take a look at the way application pop-up menus 
are used in the pdfPictures files.

Writing document-level JavaScripts
If you use JavaScript to open and close files, all destination files need to have a document-level 
JavaScript to make the open actions workable. To open each file being addressed with a JavaScript, 
you need to add one line of code at the document level.
For each file you want to open from a pop-up menu, open each target document and choose 
Advanced ➪ Document Processing ➪ Document JavaScripts. In the JavaScript Functions dialog box, 
type a name for the script in the field box at the top of the dialog box. Click the Add button to open 
the JavaScript Editor. Delete all the default text in the JavaScript Editor and type the following code:
this.disclosed = true;
Click OK in the JavaScript Editor to return to the JavaScript Functions dialog box. Click Close and 
save the file. Repeat the steps for all files you want to open with a JavaScript.
If you don’t add the aforementioned code to the document level, the files won’t open with a 
JavaScript. Be certain to verify that all documents contain this one line of code at the document level.

BC28
Understanding JavaScript
Creating a pop-up menu
After coding functions in the destination documents, create a button field on a form used as a con-
tents page and add the following JavaScript:
1. var c = app.popUpMenu
2. ([“Category 1”, “1a.pdf”, “1b.pdf”],
3. [“Category 2”, “2a.pdf”, “2b.pdf”],
4. [“Category 3”, “3a.pdf”, “3b.pdf”]);
5. this.slave = app.openDoc((c), this);
The first line of code assigns the variable c to the app.popUpMenu method. Three categories are 
in lines 2 to 4. The category name is the first item in quote marks on each line. Following the cate-
gory names are the filenames that open when the menu item is selected. Line 5 instructs Acrobat 
to open the selected file.
To create your own pop-up menus, change the category names to menu titles you want to use. 
Following each category, type the name of the respective document to open. Be certain to begin 
line 2 with an open parenthesis (and use a closed parenthesis) after the last line of code used to 
identify the category and filenames (line 4). Each line of code where the categories and filenames 
appear is contained within brackets.
The code used above works in Acrobat 9, as well as earlier viewers. Updates to the JavaScript 
implementation in Adobe Acrobat support more refinement for coding application pop-up menus. 
These newer code listings can be found in the Acrobat JavaScript Reference Manual for version 8 of 
Acrobat. An example of a script using an application pop-up menu that opens your default Web 
browser and takes you to Adobe’s Web site where Web pages open for Acrobat and Adobe Reader 
is coded as follows:
1. var aParams = [
2. {cName: “Adobe Web Page”, cReturn: “www.adobe.com”},
3. {cName: “-”},
4. {cName: “The Adobe Acrobat family”,
5. cReturn: “http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/main.html”},
{cName: “Adobe Reader”,
cReturn: “http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html”}
6. ];
7. // apply the function app.popUpMenuEx to the app object, with 
an array
8. // of parameters aParams
9. var cChoice = app.popUpMenuEx.apply( app, aParams );
There’s much more to creating application pop-up menus and many changes to app.openDoc that 
was implemented in version 8 of Acrobat. Be certain to review the Acrobat JavaScript Reference 
Manual for code samples using these and other routines you want to implement in Acrobat.

Working with Trusted Functions
Some Acrobat JavaScript methods have security restrictions. A number of different methods were 
eliminated from a non-privileged list in Acrobat 7 and continued with more restrictions in Acrobat 
8 and 9. Using JavaScripts for opening alert dialog boxes, opening files, and navigating pages falls 
into the category of non-privileged events. Adding page templates, deleting pages, inserting pages, 
creating new documents, adding bookmarks, and so on falls into privileged events.
One of the ideas behind adding trusted functions to enable privileged events is to protect the end 
user from changing a document without the user’s knowledge. If you create a page action on the 
second page of a document that deletes pages 3 through 6, for example, the user is clearly unaware 
that navigating to page 2 could potentially destroy the document. To protect users from having 
these kinds of problems, Adobe added Trusted Functions to the Acrobat implementation of 
JavaScript. In order for privileges to be granted, the end user needs to copy a small JavaScript to 
the Acrobat JavaScript folder, thereby making the user aware that some special treatment of the 
PDF file is likely to occur.
Creating new documents
When you add a Trusted Function to a document you need two scripts in two different locations. 
One location is in your document in any one of the areas from which you can invoke an action to 
run a JavaScript. The other location is a separate script saved to a text file and placed inside the 
Acrobat JavaScripts folder.
To make this clearer, let’s first look at creating a folder-level script in the steps below, and then 
later we’ll look at the script you add to a button inside a PDF document.
STEPS: Writing a folder-level script
 
1. Open a text editor. Be certain to use a program such as WordPad or NotePad 
(Windows) or TextEdit (Macintosh). Don’t use a word processing program. Some unex-
pected results may occur.
 
2. Write the following code in your text editor.
1. var trustedNewDoc = app.trustedFunction( function (nWidth, 
nHeight)
2. {
3.  app.beginPriv(); // explicitly raise privilege
4.  app.newDoc( nWidth, nHeight );
5. app.endPriv();
})
 
3. Save the file as text only and use a.js extension.

BC30
Understanding JavaScript
 
4. Copy the file to your JavaScripts folder. On Windows the directory path is C:\Program 
Files\Adobe\Acrobat 9.0\Acrobat\Javascripts.
 
 On the Mac, open your logon Library folder and open the Acrobat User Data: 9.0_x86 
folder. Copy the text file to the JavaScripts folder.
The JavaScript code for this trusted function starts out with assigning the variable trusted
NewDoc to the function with width and height parameters. In line 3, you see the privileges 
granted. This is like opening a locked door. The app.newDoc object creates a new document at 
the nWidth and nHeight values (this is determined in the button script later in Acrobat). The 
fifth line of code ends the privileges (or locks the door).
The next step is to create the script in Acrobat. In Figure 36.22, you can see where we’re headed. 
I have a document with several predefined page sizes. The Create PDF ➪ From Blank Page com-
mand provides only a few page sizes when creating new blank files. I’d like some more, so I cre-
ated a template with buttons that have scripts to create new pages. Without a Trusted Function, 
my buttons won’t work.
 FIGURE 36.22
A document with several predefined page sizes and buttons with JavaScripts that create blank new pages.
To write the button scripts in Acrobat, follow these steps.
STEPS: Using a Trusted Function in Acrobat
 
1. Create a button field. You can use any one of the locations where JavaScripts are permit-
ted. For this example, I’ll use a button field.

BC31
Understanding JavaScript
 
2. Format the field. Set the format attributes for the field name, appearance, and a button 
face, as described in Chapter 34.
 
3. Add a JavaScript. Click the Actions tab and add a Run a JavaScript action. In the 
JavaScript Editor, type the following code:
1. trustedNewDoc(432,288);
 
4. Click OK.
 
5. Test the script. Click the button with the Hand tool and a blank new document 6 x 4 
inches should appear in the Document pane.
The code in the single line of text calls the Trusted Function (by function name trustedNewDoc) 
and the values are the measurements of the new page in points. To translate the points to inches, 
divide by 72.
In this example, I added some preset page sizes and used buttons to create the new documents. 
Another alternative you have available is to create a JavaScript as a New menu item and write the 
code so a dialog box opens prompting you to add custom page sizes. The script is longer, but fol-
lows the same principles by writing a Trusted Function and copying it to the JavaScript folder. 
When adding a menu item, you don’t need a script in a PDF document.

Adding menu commands
Menu items can be added with JavaScripts written as Trusted Functions to customize your Acrobat 
workplace. You can add menu items for just about any kind of action and position the menu com-
mand in any one of the Acrobat menus. For an example of how to add menu items, follow the 
steps below:
STEPS: Adding menu commands with JavaScript
 
1. Launch your text editor. Be certain to use a text editor and not a word processor.
 
2. Write the following code in the text editor:
1.   function totalPages(){
2. app.alert(“Total Pages: “ + this.numPages);
3.   }
4.   function totalFields(){
5.  app.alert(“Total Fields: “+ this.numFields);
6.   }
7.   function totalTemplates(){
8.  app.alert(“Total Page Templates in this file: “+ this.
numTemplates);

9.   }
10. app.addMenuItem ({cName: “Total Pages”,
  cParent: “Tools”, cExec: “totalPages()”
11. });
12. app.addMenuItem ({cName: “Number of Fields”,
  cParent: “Tools”, cExec: “totalFields()”
13. });
14. app.addMenuItem ({cName: “Page Templates”,
  cParent: “Tools”, cExec: “totalTemplates()”
15. });
 
3. Save the text file with a.js extension.
 
4. Copy the file to your Acrobat JavaScripts folder.
 
5. Launch Acrobat. If Acrobat was open when you added the script to the JavaScripts 
folder, quit the program and relaunch Acrobat.
 
6. Open the Tools menu. At the bottom of the menu you should see three additional menu 
commands, as shown in Figure 36.23.
 FIGURE 36.23
The Tools menu shows three new menu items produced by the folder level JavaScript.
Selecting a menu item opens a dialog box reporting the total pages in the open document, the total 
number of fields in the open document, and the total number of templates in the open document. 
Particularly useful are the Total Fields and Page Templates commands. Because you don’t see any 
indication in toolbars as to how many fields exist in the document or whether the document con-
tains any page templates, selecting the menu commands quickly reports total fields and page tem-
plates found in the document. In Figure 36.24, selecting the Total Fields menu command opened 
an alert dialog box that reports the total fields in the open PDF file.

BC33
Understanding JavaScript
 FIGURE 36.24
The total number of fields in a document are reported in an application alert dialog box after selecting the 
Total Fields menu command.
In the JavaScript to create the Tools menu items, the first eight items handle the computations for 
total pages, total fields, and total templates. Lines 10 through 15 contain the addMenuItem 
objects and attributes for the menu commands’ locations (Tools menu) and displays.
Summary
 One method for learning JavaScript is to examine forms with scripts. You can copy 
JavaScripts in the JavaScript Editor dialog box or copy form fields and links.
 JavaScripts are found in several places in PDF documents including fields, links, book-
marks, page actions, document-level scripts, and document actions.
 The Edit All JavaScripts command lists all JavaScripts in a document. When you’re 
 learning how a form executes JavaScripts, examining all potential areas where scripts 
are written is a good idea.
 Viewer types and viewer version alerts are used to inform users whether their Acrobat 
viewer is the correct version and type to complete a form.
 Sums of data in rows and columns are calculated with JavaScripts using loops to gather 
data through each pass in a loop.
 Document actions are used to execute a JavaScript when a file opens, closes, or prints.
 Pages can be spawned in a document to create new pages from a template page. When 
pages are spawned, all fields, links, and JavaScripts on the new spawned pages are dupli-
cated from the template page with new field names.
 Pop-up menus can save some space on a form where lists in nested menus are scripted to 
open pages and/or documents.
 Trusted Functions enable you to grant temporary permissions for executing JavaScripts 
for privileged methods. These scripts require you to copy the scripts to the JavaScript 
folder in addition to the scripts you write in Acrobat.
