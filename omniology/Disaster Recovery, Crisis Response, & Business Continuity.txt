Introduction
Business continuity and disaster recovery have emerged as critical aspects 
of business planning in the past few years. It was born in high-risk and highly 
regulated industries but is now spreading rapidly into all sectors and every 
type of organization. Why? More and more businesses are affected by natural 
and manmade disasters, more regulators expect to see recovery plans in 
place for industries beyond health and finance, more organizations expect 
to see continuity policies in place at vendor sites, and insurers drop rates for 
businesses showing greater awareness of security protocols. More important, 
in the age of 24/7 business, customers expect to be able to do business with 
you when it’s convenient for them. Never mind that your city just flooded; just 
send me my goods or complete my transaction.
Originally, business continuity and recovery planning were the domain of a few 
elite consultants. Historically, consultants charged a premium for their skills 
and knowledge to organizations. These companies had no choice but to pay 
for custom consultancy engagements. Now, with increased need for continuity 
planning and more practitioners embedded inside organizations, business 
continuity has effectively been commoditized—every business needs to plan 
for unexpected events or pay the consequences. This commoditization is a 
good thing because organizations need continuity plans in place quickly, at the 
lowest cost and with the least pain. 
This book covers the key aspects of business continuity and disaster recovery. 
It is written so anyone can pick it up, read it, then go and do it. It tells you what 
you need to do, gives you simple tools to use, and tells you what questions you 
need to ask and from whom you should seek the answers. Just as important, 
it provides checklists and templates that will help you put a credible plan in 
quick order.
Why Read This Book?
You have a job to do protecting your company from disasters, hackers, supply 
problems, and anything else that might keep you from fulfilling your mission. 
I want you to learn from my mistakes and quickly acquire the necessary 
knowledge to get the job done. I want you to avoid the trial-and-error journey 
that my peers and I had to suffer as we learned the hard way. 

Introduction 
xiv
So if you want to learn all the essential aspects of business continuity while 
avoiding the pain, then this book is for you.
There are lots of excellent books that tell you what you’ve got to do. This 
book is for people who want to know how to do it. 
The aim of this book is to explain (in simple terms) all the key elements of 
business continuity and disaster recovery for people who need to:
Learn the basics of business continuity fast
• 
Get something in place today so they’ll have a chance if 
• 
disaster strikes tomorrow
Avoid the principal mistakes people in your position often 
• 
make
Prepare solid plans that people find easy to use and 
• 
maintain
Identify and fix security and continuity gaps in your sys-
• 
tems, processes, or people
Test your continuity plans and the people, suppliers, and 
• 
technology that your organization depends on
Make sure your staff knows what to expect from the 
• 
organization if disaster strikes—and what the organiza-
tion should expect from you
Become compliant with the demands of internal auditors, 
• 
external regulators, and business partners that expect them 
to have solid, demonstrable continuity plans in place
Extend the principles of continuity into supplier organiza-
• 
tions and business partners so that third parties are able 
to meet your needs
Keep all the plans, scripts, solutions, and other functions 
• 
up to date without making it into a full-time job
If it’s your job to accomplish any of these things, read on.  This book is for you!

Who Should Read This Book
This book is relevant to anyone who is in anyway involved in business continuity, 
crisis management, and disaster recovery (DR). 
This list includes:
Business continuity managers
• 
Business continuity coordinators—people who look after 
• 
local plans and do the day-to-day administration and test-
ing for their department
IT staff and technicians who support business continuity or 
• 
DR solutions and are involved in testing or have responsi-
bility for some element of the recovery of their business
IT architects and developers who are responsible for 
• 
including resilience into their designs and the solutions 
they deliver
Executives accountable for the continued smooth running 
• 
of their businesses, funding business continuity efforts, 
and making sure it meets underlying business needs
Staff who have a role to play in preparing plans, testing, or 
• 
have responsibilities in disaster recovery situation
Auditors who are responsible for making sure that the or­gani­
• 
zation’s continuity arrangements meet business needs
Suppliers that need to meet their customers’ needs in 
• 
regard to business continuity and DR
Suppliers that sell business continuity or DR services  
• 
Practices to Underpin Frameworks
There are many excellent business continuity management (BCM) frameworks. 
BS259991 and AS/NZS 50502 are two good examples. Each sets out what you 
have to do and to some extent what you should learn. They also provide 
a common vocabulary for you to use. The problem with standards and 
frameworks, however, is that in general they don’t tell you how to do anything. 
How do you assess a business impact analysis? How do you plan and deliver a 
DR test? How do you keep your staff informed? How do you keep your plans 
updated?

Introduction 
xvi
In this book, I mean to plug such gaps by sharing my experience and describing 
what I and other experienced BC/DR people actually do. 
For some people, BCM is an emotive subject; many practitioners are exacting 
and fussy in what they do. To be frank, I’m not overly attached to what we do. 
Continuity planning is simply something that must be done in our day and age. 
But I do care about getting results efficiently and effectively. I also like to do 
that without upsetting or distracting too many other people! But it’s possible 
to get bogged down in detail and perfectionism. To avoid that, do what I do 
and keep your mind on the practical. 
For this reason, if you read anything in this book and can think of a better way 
of doing things, don’t think badly about me. Instead think, “I should send this 
idea to Jamie!”3 Take the time to gather your thoughts and let me know so I 
can improve what I do and then improve this book! 
Why Listen to Me?
First, I’ve spent most of the past 25 years working in business continuity and 
IT disaster recovery–related roles, much of it in the financial services and 
banking industry, and should have learned most of what there is to know.
So, what I’m offering you is the chance to exploit my mistakes and gain my 
insight in days—not months or years!
One of the key issues I’ve faced, and an issue that will probably concern you 
too, is how to deliver business continuity through people who have other 
full-time roles that have nothing to do with business continuity—people for 
whom business continuity is a pain and a distraction from their main role. If 
that describes you, you’ve come to the right book. My overarching goal is to 
make your job easier, something I can do by telling you how things play out in 
the real world.
When creating a business continuity program, I’ve also come to realize it’s 
essential to build it with the following principle in mind: 
The program must address the deeper technical issues but without 
needing full-time experts to make it work.
In short, I believe my job is to make business continuity simple and suitable for 
people who only look at their business continuity/DR plans once or twice a 
year. So wherever possible I will aim to demystify business continuity, so that 
when people come back to their plans nine months down the line, it’ll be fairly 
easy to understand or implement. If you want to learn to make it simple, then 
I’m your man.

Structure of the Book
The chapters are written so that you can either dip in as you need to or 
you can read it section by section. The sections are organized as you should 
ideally approach business continuity, so unless you have a specific need it’s best 
to read the book in chapter order.
However, if sections or chapters don’t apply—for example, you don’t have any 
third-parties contractors—you might want to skip them.
I’ve tried to highlight the relevance of each chapter at the beginning so you can 
decide in a few moments if it’s worth reading on.
The book is organized in the following five parts:
Part One: Introduction to Business Continuity 
• 
and Disaster Recovery. Introduces the basic concepts 
and provides you with the who, what, when, where—and 
a high-level how—of business continuity, crisis management, 
and disaster recovery.  
Part Two: Plan for Business Continuity and Disaster 
• 
Recovery. Explains how to plan for business continuity. 
The section looks at both business continuity plans and 
IT disaster recovery plans.
Part Three: Test and Maintain Your Continuity and 
• 
Recovery Plans. Examines all the testing and mainte-
nance that is relevant to business continuity with chap-
ters on IT testing, business testing, and maintenance.
Part Four: Execute the Plan
• 
. There’s no point in hav-
ing plans and solutions if you can’t deploy them at a time 
of crisis. This section explains what you need to do to 
make sure you steer your organization though whatever 
disruption comes your way. More than that, it also covers 
the return from contingency to normal operations.
Part Five: Appendices
• 
. Here you’ll find copies of use-
ful things like checklists, templates, and processes that I 
describe in the book. You can use them to get your own 
business continuity up and running. The appendices also 
include some useful reference information and links to 
other useful resources.
Let’s get started!

Management
An Overview
In this chapter we introduce the key concepts of business continuity, explain 
how an organization should approach business continuity, and explore the 
roles that underpin business continuity. Everything covered here will be quite 
high level, and all the key themes will be explored in more detail in the sub-
sequent chapters.
What Is Business Continuity Management?
Business continuity management (BCM) exists to avoid any interruptions that 
could lead to either significant losses or a failure to achieve the organization’s 
principal objectives. BCM is both a process and a discipline.
The sorts of things business continuity exists to deal with are wide ranging, 
from the mundane to the most dramatic events, such as from someone leav-
ing the water running to volcanic ash clouds or space weather. The aims of 
business continuity vary depending on the nature of the organization and are 
as general as keeping the light on and as specific as providing all staff with char-
gers so that they can use their phones and laptops following a Superstorm 
Sandy–type event.

Business continuity is an umbrella discipline and encompasses some specific 
disciplines such as business continuity planning, where you do all the work to 
prepare for a disaster; service continuity, where you set up, maintain, and test 
the technology solutions that support business continuity; and crisis manage-
ment, which is the process you will use to respond to major events that your 
“business as usual” processes can’t cope with.
KEY POINTS OF THE CHAPTER
This chapter is basic grounding and is relevant for everyone. It does the following:
Explains why we have business continuity
• 
Describes how business continuity is delivered
• 
Introduces some basic concepts and vocabulary
• 
Introduces the key roles for people involved
• 
Outlines some key standards for business continuity and disaster 
• 
recovery (DR)
Identifies further sources of reference, services, and support
• 
Business Continuity as a Process
The process of business continuity, also known as the business continuity life 
cycle, describes how any organization should go about ensuring that critical 
activities are performed no matter what else is happening.
The process is cyclical and follows the same basic steps as most processes of 
continuous improvement (Figure 1-1).
Figure 1-1.  Business continuity life cycle

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity

The process is first about understanding what constitutes a critical process, 
then plans how it will be introduced, then designs and delivers supporting 
solutions, then tests it all, and then is maintained. The cycle repeats itself ad 
infinitum.
Business continuity as a process really means that it is repeatable and can 
be undertaken by a wide range of people, with different levels of experience 
and seniority, and yet can achieve consistent high-quality results. Process is 
important because it gives people something they can do, and it has the added 
benefit of making everything auditable, which is increasingly important.
Business Continuity as a Discipline
When I talk about BCM as a discipline, I’m talking about how the tasks con-
nect with the people who will do them. The discipline of business continuity 
comprises policies and the collection of people and teams in your organiza-
tion that are responsible for the various steps that make up the business con-
tinuity life cycle and making sure all remain in good working order. Business 
continuity people are also responsible for monitoring incidents so that in the 
event of a business interruption the plans to ensure continuity get invoked as 
quickly as possible.
Typically, people supporting continuity include the following:
Continuity planners, who identify what is critical and 
• 
decide how it can be continued through an interruption.
IT service continuity professionals, who are responsible 
• 
for making sure the critical IT services are available to 
support critical business activities.
Crisis management team, which is responsible for moni-
• 
toring the business for potential interruption events and 
then making sure that timely action is taken, which would 
normally involve invoking the business continuity plans 
and recovering any required IT services.
How Is Business Continuity Implemented?
Exactly how business continuity is implemented depends on your organiza-
tion. The details have to make sense to the people who will use it. What  
constitutes a policy in one organization will be different from another.

Chapter 1 | Business Continuity Management
6
Ideally you should have the following:
A policy that sets out what is expected in terms of busi-
• 
ness continuity
A defined process that says how the organization will 
• 
achieve business continuity
A set of tools and templates that can be used by people  
• 
following the process to ensure consistent and high-quality  
results
Someone who is accountable for making sure that busi-
• 
ness continuity is in place and effective
An ongoing business continuity program that manages all 
• 
the activities that make up the process, checks on quality, 
promotes awareness, and identifies issues and escalates 
them for action
A set of people who have clear responsibility for the 
• 
activities that relate to business continuity
There may be other things that make sense, and the details need to be consis-
tent with how you do things in your organization and line up with any related 
processes, such as how you escalate issues.
Criticality
Criticality is how we rank things by importance to the organization. You can 
think of it as a line, and how many times you divide the lineup depends on 
your organization and its appetite for risks. Criticality is a key concept in busi-
ness continuity management that needs further explanation.
Fundamentally, business continuity is driven by an understanding of what’s 
critical and how that criticality changes over time.
Broadly speaking, activities can be divided into the following categories:
• 
Mission critical: The few things you have to do if your busi-
ness is to survive
• 
Essential: The things you must do that will cause a massive, 
but not immediately fatal, impact if they are not done
• 
Important: The things to do after you’ve taken care of the 
previous two
• 
Not important: Things you can put on the back burner 
during the disaster

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity

For example, in a bank, settlement is life and death and so fits in the first  
category. If the bank fails to settle, the whole financial system can fail. For the  
same bank, servicing customer accounts is important, but if not done for  
24 hours, the impact is not fatal to the bank. However, you may find that a point  
comes when the backlog builds up to a point that it can’t be cleared faster 
than new work comes in. At this point, it becomes critical. Selling new prod-
ucts is deemed least important and can be suspended in order that available 
resources can be directed to looking after existing customers or other more 
critical activities.
Of course, it’s never as simple as that because things that are not life and 
death in the first 24 hours may become so if they are not performed within, 
say, 2 days.
Note
■
■
  It’s essential that criticality is defined in clear terms and that these terms are adopted by 
all areas concerned. See Appendix A for an example of criticality levels. These are not universal; you 
will need to tailor them to reflect your organization’s priorities.
Severity Levels
If criticality levels provide a measure of how important something is to the 
business, severity levels tell us how significant events are.
To understand these differences, imagine criticality is how deep you are cut, 
and severity is where you’re being cut. So, you might cut your arm off and live, 
but cut your head off and you’re dead.
For an example of severity levels, see Appendix K.
Note
■
■
  For an illustration of how severity levels can be mapped to criticalities, look at Appendix L.
Scenarios and Risks
Some events have an impact on your business. It could be a fire, a flood, a 
power outage, or what have you. Consequently, you need some activity to 
recover or manage the impact. The action should either address the issue or 
maintain the delivery of your service. If you manage the event properly, you 
can recover without much fallout. Of course, if you don’t manage the impact, 
it can lead to disaster!

Figure 1-2 depicts the life cycle of a disaster.
Focus on Outcomes, Not Causes
A major mistake many professionals make is to focus on the possible causes 
of events. The problem is that there are infinite possible causes. A real risk is 
that you can spend all your life doing risk assessments and are not ready for 
what comes along.
A better approach is to focus on the impacts and how they manifest them-
selves in terms of outcomes. It makes much more sense to do this because, 
for an infinite number of potential causes, the possible impacts boil down into 
only five outcome scenarios.
That means you focus first on preparing the basic elements of business conti-
nuity so that you can survive the five possible outcome scenarios.
Tip
■
■
  Don’t spend any time trying to identify all the possible potential causes of a problem and 
preparing for each one in turn. Instead, focus on preparing for the possible outcomes.
Once you’re prepared for the scenarios, then you can think increasingly about 
mitigating the likely causes!
MAXIMIZE YOUR TIME AT THE START
In a less than a day you can have the basics of a plan that will enable you to avoid most 
potential disasters. Or you can spend months on risk assessment and impact analysis 
only to face a disaster before you’ve even started on the basics of a plan.
This is quite contentious, and many “experts” disagree with me and advocate a 
methodical approach where you work through all the steps sequentially and complete 
detailed analysis first. I wonder if they are more attached to their methods than the goal, 
which is to make sure we and our businesses survive no matter what!
Figure 1-2.  Life cycle of a disaster

The Five Possible Outcome Scenarios
As mentioned, there are infinite possible causes or risks to your business, but 
they manifest as one of just five possible outcomes. The potential scenarios 
are as follows:
• 
Loss of technology: The technology you use is not available 
or doesn’t work.
• 
Loss of a building: A building is destroyed or out of action 
for the medium to long term.
• 
Denial of access to a building: Your staff is not allowed into 
their place of work.
• 
Loss of staff: Key staff members are unable to attend 
work.
• 
Loss of a supplier: A supplier is unable to provide critical 
services, products, or resources.
Business continuity is all about preparing for and ultimately managing the 
responses to these scenarios. It’s important to take a risk-based approach 
to potential outcomes based on your unique situation. For example, you will 
want to focus first on the most likely scenario for your organization and those 
solutions or elements of business continuity that will maximize your chances 
of survival (the first level on your criticality list). For one company it might be 
technology recovery; for another, it might be continuing critical activities such 
as fulfilling orders.
Let’s look at each of the five scenarios in more detail.
Responding to Loss of Technology
IT systems are probably the most common cause of a business interruption. 
Hence, the backbone of your business continuity may be your strategy for 
ensuring the continuity of critical systems.
Normally, you’d have an alternative system that can be used. Ideally, it will be 
located at a secondary site that has independent infrastructure, such as a site 
with power that is far enough away to be unaffected by the event affecting the 
main site.
If the criticality of the function demands that you cannot tolerate even a brief 
outage, you need to consider investing in additional resiliency so that the 
system can continue operating even if its major components are disrupted or 
there’s a local infrastructure failure.
Chapter 5 has a fuller explanation of DR and resiliency.

Chapter 1 | Business Continuity Management
10
For non-IT technology such as machinery, you should consider suitable strate-
gies, such as having backup equipment or, if practical, the ability to switch to an 
external supplier to serve your critical needs.
Responding to Loss of a Building
If a building is destroyed or out of action for the medium to long term, say by 
a severe fire or hurricane, you’ll need some way of continuing any required 
activities that are normally completed at that location.
Ideally you will have either of the following:
A secondary location where key workers can go to 
• 
resume critical activities
The ability to switch the work to another, unaffected 
• 
location where the work can be completed
We normally call the secondary site option work area recovery (WAR). WAR 
can be provided either in-house, where you have some spare capacity in 
another building, or by a third-party vendor.
Ultimately, you will also need to find somewhere or some way to get the less 
critical activities done because few of them will be deferrable indefinitely.
I will deal with WAR and other strategies fully in Chapter 6.
Responding to Denial of Access to a Building
More likely than actually losing your building is that you find that your staff 
members are not allowed into their place of work because of a local event. 
This might be a fire, flood, utilities outage, and so on. In many cases, these 
events will be minor or not directly affect the integrity of your building.
This is likely to be short term; such events often last less than 24 hours. 
Because of the short nature, it’s critical that you gauge the impact quickly and 
estimate likely resolution time. It’s not unreasonable to have staff waiting for 
an hour, but a day could be disastrous.
If the outage is longer than one day, you will probably treat it in exactly the 
same way you would if you had lost the building.
Responding to Loss of Staff
Another possibility is that your staff is unable or unwilling to get to work.
At the extreme, this could be because a significant percentage is incapacitated—
say by an epidemic—but it also addresses the more likely possibility that  

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
11
your staff can’t get to work because of transport or the weather. Another 
possibility is that people are unwilling to come to work because of industrial 
action, because of fear of being infected, or because they have more pressing 
commitments at home.
This is the most difficult scenario to deal with because it comes in a wide 
variety of flavors, can strike anywhere, and can scale from a localized event up 
to a global one.
To cope, you first need a good understanding of critical activities, the skills 
required to complete these activities, and exactly which people would be 
required to keep operations running. Armed with this information, you can 
start to do some preventative work such as the cross training of staff where 
single points of failure exist. A single point of failure is, for example, where you 
depend on a single person in a single location to perform a critical task.
Responding to Loss of a Supplier
As the majority of organizations remain focused on their core activities and 
outsource their noncore activities, they have become increasingly dependent 
on their supply chains.
Consequently, to achieve business continuity, you need to understand these 
dependencies.
Understanding alone is not enough. You’ll also need to be aware of any prob-
lems that may occur in your supply chain so that at the first sign of trouble 
you can secure an alternative supply. In some instances, this may involve in-
sourcing the activity. Whatever your strategy, if problems are appearing on 
the horizon, you must make sure that the supplier is managing its response 
effectively. If not, then you must be prepared to act swiftly.
I’d stress the need for “management by exception” here. You really don’t want 
to be monitoring every business as usual activity. What you need is to be 
included in any incident escalation and reporting, and you need to make sure 
that this communication is swift and unimpeded.
Tip
■
■
  Rather than keeping a watchful eye on suppliers for potential trouble, ask suppliers to keep 
you informed of incidents and ensure lines of communication are clear. You will, of course, want to 
watch for clues that trouble is brewing—financial problems, labor issues, and so on.
Each year, you have to do more work with less time, money, and resources to 
get it done. The great lesson from this is that you have to invest time up front, 
in things such as good incident escalation, that work without you so that you 
are freed from day-to-day involvement until it becomes necessary.

Chapter 1 | Business Continuity Management

The Importance of Time
Already we’ve started to discuss some requirements of maintaining business 
continuity: identifying critical tasks, critical people, and any critical resources 
that are needed to do these tasks.
But the common denominator for everything in business continuity is time.
From an IT point of view, for example, business continuity requirements are 
some of your most important nonfunctional requirements (NFRs) when you 
are delivering IT solutions.
Broadly speaking, these requirements can be framed as follows:
You need to know how long you can survive without 
• 
doing something or having something happen.
You need to know how long operations can be sustained 
• 
in a reduced capacity.
You need to know how much of the work you can afford 
• 
to lose before it proves disastrous, as opposed to how 
much you can afford to lose before it merely causes 
inconvenience. Again, this is measured in time. For exam-
ple, you might decide you can afford to lose no more than 
two hours of work.
In business continuity, the time-based requirements have been defined as a set 
of objectives. We will look at these next.
Recovery Time Objective
The recovery time objective (RTO) defines how quickly a system or process 
must be recovered after it fails.
Criticality is normally closely associated with RTOs. So, your most critical 
processes might have an RTO of 0. In other words, you can’t tolerate any 
downtime. The next level might be 0 to 2 hours, and so on.
There’s a lot of debate about RTO. Quite often, people inside the same orga-
nization may have very different views of how an RTO is defined. For example, 
the business will mean exactly what I just said—that RTO represents the 
time from an event occurring until the system, service, or facility is restored. 
However, in the same organization, the IT department might take RTO to 
mean how quickly the system will be brought up after the decision is made to 
start the recovery.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity

To understand the issues, consider the following scenario. It might take IT  
3 hours to bring a system up, plus 30 minutes for the business to set it up. The 
business may have identified a need to get the system back in 4 hours. Sounds 
OK: 3 hours + 30 minutes is less than 4 hours, right? But, this doesn’t allow 
for “management” time to identify the issue, assess it, decide on which action 
to take, and perhaps notify decision makers and get authorization.
In practice, it might be 3 hours before IT starts the recovery! From their point 
of view, they are fine with that because they still meet their version of the 
RTO, taking 3 hours to recover and adding on the 30 minutes set up. Yet it has 
now taken 6 hours and 30 minutes. So, while IT may think it met the RTO, the 
business has lost $2 million!
For this reason, I recommend you split the overall business recovery time 
from the system recovery time. To this end, I’ll introduce another term, maxi-
mum disruption time (MDT), which is starting to be used more widely.
Maximum Disruption Time
MDTs are used to define the business’s overall recovery objective, that is, the 
time from an event occurring until the system is available again.
I recommend using it for the overall business RTO rather than IT’s because 
the IT RTO will probably be embedded in far more reports and used more 
widely than the business one. However, it does mean that if you are introduc-
ing MTDs, you will have to change all your reporting.
The MDT gives the people managing an event the broader context. Given the 
MTD and the RTO for the systems, they can see how much time they can 
spend trying to fix the problem before they begin the recovery.
There are different terms used in different organizations, but the most common 
one used as an alternative to MTD is maximum allowable downtime (MAD).
Maximum Tolerable Period of Disruption
As if this wasn’t confusing enough, recent standards have proposed that we 
should also have a measure of how long it is before an interruption causes the 
complete failure of an organization, the maximum tolerable period of disruption 
(MTPoD). This makes some sense, but in practice it doesn’t seem to be widely 
understood or adopted.
Tip

  If you can shape the life cycle, I recommend you stick with RTO for IT and MDT for the 
business.

Chapter 1 | Business Continuity Management

Recovery Point Objective
Recovery point objective (RPO) defines the maximum amount of data loss you 
can tolerate. In other words, the RPO tells you how far back you can revert 
your data when you are recovering a system or process.
This has major implications for IT because it dictates how frequently data 
backups must be made and dictates the architecture of the system itself. These 
two things have a significant impact on development, testing, maintenance, and 
consequently costs.
In simple terms, if a system fails (say it goes down at 1:00 p.m.), the RPO 
defines how far back it’s acceptable to roll the data. In this example, it might be 
acceptable to go back to start of day. Now if the working day is 8 hours, you 
would set RPO to 8 hours. Conversely, it might be a banking system where it’s 
unacceptable to lose any transactional data, and you’ll set the RPO at 0.
In practical terms, an RPO of 0 is not guaranteed because, at the point of 
failure, transactions can be lost, but the loss will be at a manageable level—a 
small number of transactions rather than thousands or millions.
Who Does What?
Now that you understand the importance of time in business continuity man-
agement, let’s look at the roles people take. I’ve summarized the key roles in 
sections, each of which sets out what it is that they are supposed to achieve, 
the specific tasks they undertake, and the outputs or deliverables they should 
produce.1
Role: Business Continuity Manager
Objective: Ensure that business continuity is in place and the organization has 
a proven ability to recover.
1I’ve included a type of RACI matrix in Appendix B, which defines the key roles in terms of 
accountability (where the buck stops), responsibility (who actually does it), consultation 
(who should be involved in discussions), and communication (who must be informed 
about it). RACI (which stands for Responsible, Accountable, Contributing, and Informed) 
is used widely, and I’ve added my own innovation by adding an extra dimension to the 
RACI so that it also includes oversight. Hence, I’ve called it a CAIRO diagram.

When Do You Do BCM?
The business continuity life cycle or program should keep cycling around and 
continually improve as it goes.
However, the steps don’t have to happen sequentially. In fact, you may decide 
that some activities are monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, and annual, while oth-
ers are ad hoc.2 Similarly, the roles are not fixed. For example, BCM may do 
some of the IT responsibilities.
Business continuity doesn’t just happen when there’s a disaster. In fact, 
responding to real events is the thing that the least time is spent on. Business 
continuity happens day in and day out as a series of activities that prepare 
your organization or improve the capability to cope with events.
Standards
Standards have been devised to help organizations perform important activi-
ties in a consistent and high-quality way. They also help different organizations 
to work together. There are both country and international standards, and 
these are governed by a group of bodies that work together to promote bet-
ter working practices and better working relationships.
2See Appendix C for an example timetable of events. In general, it’s a good idea to make 
most events at least annual so that you do the business impact analysis, plan reviews, call 
cascade test, business (WAR) recovery test, DR tests, and so on, every year.

There are a range of standards published, and these will keep evolving over 
time. Probably the most widely recognized is the new International Standards 
Organization ISO22301, which is based on the older British Standards Institute

Action Plan
This chapter has introduced some basic concepts. Some may have started you 
thinking about your organization’s current state. To help this process along, 
think about the following questions and what actions you should take:
1.	 Do you have a policy covering business continuity?
2.	 If you have any business continuity plans, check that they 
are appropriate for the key scenarios mentioned in “The 
Five Possible Outcome Scenarios.”
3.	 If your organization doesn’t refer to outcomes or doesn’t 
have a continuity plan, ask yourself which are most likely 
to happen in your organization and which would have the 
biggest impact. Armed with this insight, focus on the most 
likely or biggest impact ones first.
4.	 Have you defined your requirements for business conti-
nuity in terms of recovery time and data loss (MDT, RTO, 
and RPO)? If not, it’s time.
5.	 If you currently use RTO, do you need to introduce MDT? 
This is recommended if there is a gap between the mean-
ing that IT and management place on the RTO.
6.	 Are the key business continuity objectives, tasks, and 
deliverables mentioned in your own company’s version 
of “Who Does What?”

Kick Start Your Business Continuity
This chapter is for those with a limited (or no) business continuity plan (BCP). 
Its purpose is to make sure you have the bare minimum in place so you have 
a much better chance of surviving if disaster strikes tomorrow. Then the rest 
of the book will help you establish a plan that goes well beyond the minimum 
to enable your company to continue conducting business under duress.
BCM vs. Disaster Recovery
Many issues arise because the language we use when we talk about business 
continuity is ambiguous. The first thing to be clear about is what we mean 
when we use terms such as business continuity and disaster recovery (DR). And 
that clarity must extend to everyone in your organization.

Chapter 2 | Essentials of Business Continuity Management 
22
Let’s distinguish between business continuity and DR. Many people use these 
terms interchangeably. However, throughout this book, I will use ­disaster 
­recovery to refer to the recovery of technology. Business continuity is a ­little 
more complex; it can describe the collection of related continuity disciplines: 
disaster recovery, crisis management, and business continuity planning. Business 
continuity can also describe the process of ensuring the continuity of critical 
operations and the supply of services or products. Finally, business continuity 
can also be talked about as an attribute or characteristic of an organization: 
“This organization has business continuity.” That means it has plans in place to 
ensure it can survive a disaster without flinching, except in the most extreme 
circumstances.
Note
■
■
  In this book, disaster recovery will generally mean recovering the technology and systems 
most businesses these days rely upon. Business continuity covers DR, as well as crisis management 
and continuity planning.
Where Do You Stand Today? Take the 
Continuity Assessment
As a starting point, I strongly urge you to get a quick understanding of your 
current strengths and weaknesses so that you can make some informed  
decisions about where your immediate priorities are.
So, before you do anything else, go to Appendix E and fill in the answers. 
The continuity assessment is a simple tool to get an understanding of your 
strengths and weaknesses.
Scoring the Continuity Assessment
Each question on the assessment relates to an aspect of business continuity 
and is associated with at least one deliverable. For example, one of the plan-
ning elements questions is, “Does each system or IT service have a recovery 
plan that details the exact steps required to recover the system?” The output, 
or deliverable, would be a system/service recovery plan.
To complete the form, score each question between 0 and 10, with 0 being the 
lowest and 10 the highest.
If we take the previous example, a “10” response would be appropriate if 
there was a plan for every system and each plan was detailed enough to be 
used by a competent technician who was unfamiliar with the services. Beyond 
that, you are into shades of gray, especially when there is more than one 

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
23
aspect being considered. Don’t overanalyze this; keep your response rational 
and simple. Broadly, this is how I rate issues: 10 equals all points covered,  
7 equals the majority of points covered with limited risk, 5 equals reasonable 
coverage but some risk, and 3 equals little covered or increasing risk. Finally,  
0 equals no coverage and significant risk.
Next decide how mature your associated deliverable or process is. The ­process 
of assessing maturity is explained fully in Chapter 10, but here’s a quick scoring 
table:
0—Nonexistent: No management processes are applied.
1—Initial: Processes are ad hoc and disorganized.
2—Repeatable: Processes follow a regular pattern.
3—Defined: 
Processes 
are 
documented 
and 
communicated.
4—Managed: Processes are monitored and measured.
5—Optimized: Best practices are followed and 
automated.
Having done the assessment, you must next decide two things for each aspect 
of business continuity. First, how much do you want to implement? Second, how 
mature must the processes that support that aspect of business continuity be?
This is a subtle but important point. It’s up to you and your management to 
decide how mature it needs to be. At a minimum, pretty much everything 
needs to be repeatable. Next review these responses, focusing on the Tier 1  
questions first, then the Tier 2 questions, and finally the Tier 3s, with an 
eye toward prioritizing the implementation of each. (Tier 1s are the most  
important—the must-haves—and the 2s and 3s are of lesser importance, 
though still critical in many cases.) Naturally, you‘ll probably want to start 
with the Tier 1s first, then the 2s and 3s—using a little common sense and 
the support of your management regarding the associated priorities for your 
organization.
Once you know what you want to implement and how mature you want it 
to be, you need to finalize the priorities. It’s rarely as simple as following the 
tiers, though they are a key factor to consider. I also think about the impact 
that the implementation of this or that aspect of business continuity will have 
on reducing risk. As I look at all the options, I also factor in how easy would 
it be. So, a Tier 1 that has a massive impact on the risk but is easy, cheap, and 
quick would be at the top of the list.

Chapter 2 | Essentials of Business Continuity Management

Start with the Essentials
If you are struggling at this point (and given the number of elements identified 
in the questionnaire, you probably are), it’s worth trying to refocus at a high 
level on what is most important.
With this in mind, I suggest you cover the basics of business continuity, which 
are the following:
Crisis management team (crisis management/crisis 
• 
response)
Call cascade (planning and testing)
• 
Business continuity plan (planning, education and aware-
• 
ness, and third-party BCM)
DR for essential resources (capability, testing, and educa-
• 
tion and awareness)
Let’s look at each in turn.
Crisis Management Team
Crisis management team sounds very grand, but in practical terms it’s just the 
core group of people leading your organization through a crisis.
Your first order of business is to create the team. It should comprise the 
people who understand and can direct the critical aspects of your business.
As a rule of thumb, the key roles will probably be people from the following 
areas:
• 
Senior management: The crisis leader will often be the 
chief executive or chief operating officer.
• 
HR: This is someone who can manage any people issues.
• 
Facilities: This is someone who can manage any issues that 
relate to buildings and related services.
• 
Communications: This is someone who can manage the 
communication of information to your staff, customers, 
suppliers, the media, and other stakeholders.
• 
IT: This is someone who can manage any IT issues.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
25
• 
Business lines: This is representation from the key business 
lines so that issues within each line of business can be 
managed.
• 
Business continuity: If you have a manager, this person 
should be on the team.
The crisis management team should be convened to tackle major issues that 
fall outside of what your business processes can deal with. The team’s first 
task is to establish the facts: what, when, who, where, why, how, how many, and 
so on. Then they have to decide on a set of actions, some of which will be a 
response to what’s happened. Some actions may be designed to find out more 
information, and some will be focused on securing additional resources.
It’s important that once there is a clear issue requiring crisis management, 
the team comes together quickly, establishes the facts and actions, and then 
breaks from the meeting to execute the agreed actions. The next step is to 
reconvene to review actions and share updates and new information. This 
sequence is repeated until it is felt the issue is under control and doesn’t 
require further crisis management.
Each person on the crisis management team is responsible for managing the 
flow of information from their area of the business and responding with direc-
tions and requests for more information. Where possible, they should manage 
the issues that emerge, track progress, and identify high-level risks and issues 
to the crisis leader and any other stakeholders.
See Appendix F for a detailed breakdown of tasks. These are not rigid; they 
provide a framework. In practice, one person may assume several roles, and 
other roles may be required.
WHAT MAKES A GOOD CRISIS TEAM MEMBER?
There are some behaviors and activities that are important in a crisis team member 
because they improve performance in a crisis. First, it’s essential that they are 
comfortable when there is limited information and a lot of pressure to make a decision 
and do something. They need to able to focus on vital issues and filter trivia. They need 
to be good at thinking on their feet, taking in feedback, and then decisively redirecting 
attention based on the latest information. It’s also important that they are good at 
providing concise updates and can keep their comments relevant to the team given the 
events. What is interesting to an individual, or relevant to their area, is often not relevant 
to the crisis management discussion.

Chapter 2 | Essentials of Business Continuity Management 
26
Crisis Management Team Support
The crisis management team should be provided with some support to do 
the following:
Log issues, risks, actions, and salient facts
• 
Track progress
• 
Perform any running or administrative tasks
• 
Set up the crisis room and facilities
• 
Support is critical because it allows the crisis management team to focus on 
their responsibilities and not recording information or tracking progress. The 
support team helps the crisis team by presenting the salient management 
information in an accessible format. This may be provided by the business 
continuity manager, but ideally it’s best if it is provided by other staff, such as 
executive assistants or secretaries, so the business continuity manager is free 
to do things such as chasing actions or communicating to key stakeholders.
Call Cascades
Perhaps the most important thing to be able to do in a crisis is quickly  
communicate information to staff and key stakeholders. The key issue is time. 
If you have to call 50 people, it will take hours to reach them all.
To speed things up, responsibility for calling people is broken down. The 
mechanism used is a call cascade, which basically sets out all the contacts and 
corresponding responsibility for calling people in an upside-down tree struc-
ture (Table 2-1).

The table shows that the cascade would be initiated by Jack, who calls his 
three contacts, who in turn call their contacts. In this example, by the time 
Jack has completed his calls, Jones might have completed his too, and a few 
minutes later Oak has done the last call too. (See Appendix G for a more 
comprehensive template.)
By cascading responsibility for calling people, you have both speeded up the 
cascade of information and freed the person who initiates the cascade to 
concentrate on other activities.
The template needs to be adapted to your organization. Three cascades are 
probably not going to be enough. You might want to expand the concept of 
alternates if the primary contact is not available by adding more alternates or 
even giving everyone in each cascade all the contact information so that any 
person in the chain can complete it.
Create an Instant Basic Business Continuity Plan
Don’t delay. Before you go any further, write a basic business continuity plan. 
Use Appendix H, simply fill in the blanks, and add the additional appendixes.
The key ingredients of the plan are as follows:
Key contacts/roles
• 
How to assess the situation using the “initial response 
• 
checklist”
Escalation
• 
Day 0 action plan
• 
Call cascade
• 
Assembly points
• 
Recovery site directions
• 
IT plan
• 
Communications plan
• 
HR plan
• 
Battle box contents
• 
The template doesn’t have sections for the HR plan, IT plan, and communica-
tions plan because you have to decide whether you want to include them in 
the plan or have dedicated plans for each based on the template. And the 
battle box itself is not part of the plan.
The next few sections support the template by explaining each section of  
the plan.

Chapter 2 | Essentials of Business Continuity Management 
28
Key Contacts and Roles
This contact list includes all the key people, third parties, emergency services, 
utilities contacts, conference/bridge lines, and staff emergency information 
numbers.
How to Assess a Situation
The initial response checklist, a simple memory aid memoir, sets out basic 
questions to ask when faced with a potential disaster. Using these questions 
will quickly enable the plan holder to decide the next steps and in particular 
whether to escalate or initiate business continuity plans.
Day 0 Action Plan
This is a list of the things that need to be done in chronological order. You 
will probably want to have several versions of the day 0 plan depending on the 
scenario, such as loss of IT, loss of building, denial of access to building, failure 
of key supplier, and so on.
Call Cascade
As mentioned, find a template in Appendix G.
Assembly Points
This section of the plan sets out where staff members should assemble if there 
is an evacuation of the building. You may want to have more than one mar-
shaling point so that if a cordon is imposed around your building that includes 
your marshaling points, your staff will have another place to assemble.
Tip
■
■
  Have alternate assembly points in the event that the first choice is inaccessible.
Directions to Recovery Sites
This part of the plan provides the addresses, contact numbers, and directions 
to the command center and recovery sites. Note: this may be the same loca-
tion, or you may have the crisis team meeting somewhere nearer to your 
offices, such as in a local hotel. You may also have the IT systems being recov-
ered into a recovery data center at one site and an alternative workspace 
being provided at another.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
29
IT Plan
This may be a separate plan or a section within the BCP. It describes how to 
recover the specific IT services for the business. As a separate plan, it’s similar 
to a business continuity plan but with more detail on the order of recovery. 
It might identify a dedicated IT recovery team that will operate in a similar 
fashion to the crisis management team, though the IT recovery team will be 
subordinate to the crisis management team.
The key is that it sets out the recovery steps. Ideally, it should record how 
IT would perform an orderly close down because this is often required in 
a ­disaster scenario and can often significantly minimize the impact of an 
outage.
Communications Plan
This part of the BCP sets out how communication with internal and external 
audiences will be managed. It probably includes a number of prepared mes-
sages and how communication is to be approved before being issued. It can be 
either a section of the BCP or a discreet plan.
HR Plan
The HR plan describes how HR issues will be managed and covers things such 
as accounting for staff, dealing with concerned relatives, welfare of staff and 
counseling for staff, expenses, travel, paying staff, HR policies, and so on. It can 
be either a section of the BCP or a discreet plan.
Note
■
■
  Having an HR continuity strategy is essential. How will you continue to pay employees? 
How will you account for them in a natural disaster during work hours? What if they need counseling? 
You don’t want to have to wing it in this area when disaster strikes.
Battle Box Contents
It’s desirable to have a “battle box” ready to go at all times at the recovery 
sites and command center. This box should contain critical resources and 
documents such as work instructions, contact lists, mobile phone chargers, 
and so on.
This part of the plan is a list of the contents and is useful because it makes the 
available resources visible without having to go and physically look in the box.

Chapter 2 | Essentials of Business Continuity Management 
30
Depending on the size of your organization at the affected location, you may 
have several battle boxes, with one for each area of the business so that 
people can place their own critical items in it.
Regardless of how many you may have, it’s essential to keep control of them 
and ensure they are checked regularly and the contents updated.
In addition to a battle box, you may like to have a grab-and-go pouch. I find it 
useful to have some stored where I can grab them as I get evacuated. I only keep 
the most essential items such as the overall plan, contacts, and the like, and it 
could save a lot of time, especially if, God forbid, I left my phone on my desk!
The battle box list isn’t essentially part of your BCP, but it’s a handy place to 
include it.
Senior Management Involvement
Perhaps the most important ingredient to getting business continuity out of the 
blocks and going all the way to the line is senior management engagement.
Management involvement is key because you need their support, their 
resources, and probably their time and attention. They will more than likely 
be key sources of information, and they will have to take on some work or 
responsibility.
I personally like running simple exercises to get them both engaged and 
aware of the key issues. This also has the benefit that in instances where you 
have little or no plan, the outcomes from the exercise can be used as a basis 
for a plan.
I find it works best if you get all the senior people in a room and do a desktop 
exercise based on the most likely scenarios they will face. Keep it short and 
simple. Set out the scenario, such as the data center has burned down, and 
what do we do now? What will emerge is the outline of the plan as well as a 
clear understanding of the exposure the company is currently running with-
out business continuity in place.
Employee Buy-in Plan
Once you have started pulling the basics of a plan together, you need to make 
sure that everyone involved or impacted understands their role at a time of 
crisis—what to do and what to expect.
Like so much of what I suggest, don’t leave it to chance. Take the time to plan 
how you will engage your employees and raise their basic levels of awareness. 
The plan doesn’t need to be anything grand or even formal, but it’s a powerful 
exercise to work out what you should be doing to raise awareness, to set up 
the best sequence, and to give yourself some simple time-based targets.

The first thing to do is to connect to those people in your organization who 
regularly communicate with the staff; if you have an internal communications 
team or person, that’s who you need. Reach out to them and take their advice 
about the best ways to engage the people in your organization. There’s a good 
chance that they will be able to help you; from experience, these people are 
often looking for content and will happily work something into the newsletter 
or latest news on your intranet site.
Action Plan
Before moving on, take a few moments to reflect on the following questions 
and related actions:
1.	 Do you have a crisis management team, and is it made up 
of the right people? If you’re not sure, review Appendix F.
2.	 Are all the roles that a crisis management team needs to 
cover included, and is the team adequately supported? 
If not, review “Crisis Management Team Support” in this 
chapter.
3.	 Do you have a call cascade that breaks up the responsibil-
ity for calling people in the cascade and is resilient if key 
people are not contactable? If not, review the template in 
Appendix G.
4.	 Do you have a basic business continuity plan, and does it 
cover all the basic ingredients listed in the “Basic Plan” 
section? If not, then review the template in Appendix H. 
Concentrate first on the things that will be of most use if 
a disaster happens now.
5.	 Have you taken steps to make sure that senior manage-
ment is engaged? If not, then make sure either you are 
talking to them directly or, better still, get them together 
and do an exercise that gives them some experience of 
what they’d need to do in a crisis. It will raise awareness 
of any pressing issues.
6.	 Do you have a simple plan of action to make sure that 
everyone is aware of their role, what to do, and how to 
find out information if there is a crisis? If not, create one.

Getting Started
First Things First
In business continuity, you normally start by establishing which activities are 
critical in your business. You do this to ensure you’ll be able to recover or 
protect these things if disaster strikes. The process for identifying critical 
activities and the resources on which they depend is called business impact 
analysis (BIA). A BIA begins with a questionnaire and answers critical ques-
tions, such as: What protections do you currently have in place? What gaps 
in coverage exist? How quickly can the business regain its footing? What if 
we lost Warehouse X to a fire, or Office Building Y to a flood, or Network 
System Z to a hacker?
Understand What’s Critical
BIA is the process that is followed to establish what is critical to business survival 
and then translates this into a set of recovery priorities or requirements.
BIA comprises three activities:
1.	 Creating or somehow securing a structured BIA 
questionnaire
2.	 Completing the BIA questionnaire
3.	 Analyzing the results
Let’s take a deeper look.

BIA Questionnaire
The BIA questionnaire is designed to identify what is critical and from that 
establish a set of requirements for business continuity. Typical requirements 
are a list of systems that need to be recovered and how quickly this needs to 
be done after an outage.
The questionnaire looks at impacts from the customer, legal, regulatory, finan-
cial, and reputational perspectives. There are also questions regarding critical 
resources. These resource questions establish the level of dependence on 
the resources and establish a recovery profile for the resource. For example, 
“How soon does resource X need to be recovered?” Questions help you to 
identify tolerances regarding the amount of data that can be lost.
Unfortunately, this sort of traditional approach is onerous, and unless you 
must know if each requirement is particularly driven from a regulatory, legal, 
financial, customer, or reputational perspective, I’d recommend a different 
approach.
My alternative, a more expedient BIA, can be found in Appendix I. It has a 
smaller set of questions and asks you to estimate the corresponding recov-
ery time objective (RTO) in the context of a predefined material breach 
that can occur from the legal, financial, regulatory, customer, or reputational 
perspective.
Tip
■
■
  Take a minute now to look at Appendix I and familiarize yourself with the BIA questionnaire. 
It will make the rest of the chapter much easier to understand.
However, if you prefer a longer-form BIA that requires additional question-
level analysis after each BIA is completed, you can go to my web site at  
www.BCMDeskReference.com and download a traditional BIA template.
The top-down approach I’m advocating is quicker, because you define the crite-
ria for a severe impact in measurable terms for your financial, legal, regulatory, 
customers, and reputation. Then each question is simply a test of how long it 
would take for an outage of a critical process, supplier, IT system, or internal 
dependency to lead to a severe impact. This approach takes into account all 
the dimensions of impact at once and delivers the ultimate requirement—the 
maximum time you can survive without something.
In a traditional BIA, you rate everything for each type of impact over time. 
This means a lot more questions then you have to reconcile the response to 
establish the biggest impact, in short, a lot of work.

  Either BIA questionnaire will enable you to identify critical functions, identify the resources 
that critical functions depend on, and quantify the impact on the business if these functions or the 
resources fail. It’s just that the one I provide in this book is a little smarter than the other! Businesses 
often find that senior managers are attached to the traditional, long-form BIA questionnaire. You may 
just have to deal with it. If you have a choice, use the one in Appendix I. If you’re like me, you do care 
about how you spend your time and would prefer to get a consistent and accurate set of requirements 
with as little effort as humanly possible. So, if you find a better approach, don’t moan about mine—let 
me have yours!
BIA Approach
How you go about doing your BIA depends in part on the nature of your 
organization, in part on your strengths, and also in part on the needs of the 
people you’re working with.
However, I’d strongly recommend doing the BIA as a facilitated session, where 
you ask the questions and record the responses. The alternative, handing over 
responsibility to the people in the business, yields less robust results.
The reason I recommend that you personally work through the BIA with 
department heads and other managers is in part to make their life as pain-
less as possible. More importantly, you want to ensure that the responses are 
consistent.
For example, an equities trader in a financial firm will have a completely differ-
ent attitude toward risk compared with a lawyer, and the trader’s answers to 
the BIA will reflect this. Consequently, one person’s “critical” will be another 
person’s “medium” or even “low” impact. You need to be present to help get 
the most accurate answer that everyone can agree upon.
An important element of the facilitated BIA is that you give the person com-
pleting it the context of the question and if necessary explain exactly what it 
means and what you are looking for. Another advantage is that you can test 
their responses by asking simple questions to determine their rationale and 
interpretation of the BIA questions. Testing ensures they have understood the 
questions and are responding consistently with the rest of the business.
Although the questions are unambiguous, there’s no getting around the ambi-
guity that people and their unique outlooks project on the situation.
Your approach will also probably depend on what is the best use of your time. 
If you have hundreds of business units to look after or a wide geographic 
region, you will probably be forced to rely on each unit to complete the BIA 
for you.

Chapter 3 | Getting Started
38
If you do decide that it’s not possible to offer facilitated BIAs for all your 
users, then you should put in the extra work to make the BIA as clear as 
possible and provide some additional support materials. These might include 
computer-based training (CBT) and user guides.
You will also need a rigorous review process to ensure that the BIA has been 
completed fully and is consistent with all other BIAs.
This consistency is essential because it’s the only way you can be sure you 
have your priorities right. To understand this, consider a situation in which 
you have one business unit that rates a particular process as critical and the 
next business unit rates the same process as merely “important.” It will com-
pletely undermine any confidence you have in the final analysis.

Structure the BIA 
By structuring the BIA, I mean break it down into separate questionnaires for 
logical parts of the business. This may not be necessary for a small business or 
those with a single location.
You can organize the BIA along product lines, management structure, location, 
facility, business lines, or whatever makes sense to your business. Ideally the 
structure should reflect the way the people in the business think about their 
business and how they tend to describe and do things.
Identify the BIA Contacts
Once you have structured the BIA, next identify who should complete each 
individual questionnaire and how you will approve the BIA for the unit.
The person responsible for completing a BIA is normally the manager of the 
area, although the manager may delegate the responsibility.
The person who approves the BIA should be the senior manager who is 
accountable for any failure. This person should be able to approve any invest-
ment or work required to protect the business. Approval should not be del-
egated below this level of accountability and power.
Schedule the BIAs
Schedule an initial BIA meeting only after you have discussed the aims of the 
BIA with whomever is responsible for the area. Once you have agreed on a 
suitable person to fill out the questionnaire, brief that person on what you’re 
going to do and the questions you’ll ask. This briefing will allow you to weigh 
whether you need to bring in additional people or break the BIA down into 
several meetings that each focus on different parts of the operation.
Once you’re clear that you have found the right people, schedule the first BIA 
meeting.
Conduct a BIA Meeting or Interview
Try to complete the BIA in a single session. Don’t rush, and, if needed, ask the 
person you’re working with to investigate anything that is inconclusive.
You’ll probably need a second meeting to finalize the BIA and—if the area 
is large, complex, or requires meetings with several people—you may need 
several more meetings.

Chapter 3 | Getting Started
40
Analyze the Responses
Analyze the responses to the BIA questionnaire and itemize your conclusions 
in a simple report. I cover the analysis later in this chapter.
Review the Meeting
Once you have analyzed the BIA and have a summary of the findings, meet 
again with the responsible manager and walk through the conclusions to make 
sure they match his or her understanding.
This will include any gaps that need addressing. For example, the department 
may be currently set up to solve problems within 24 hours, but the manager has 
indicated a need to complete key critical activities within 4 hours of an incident.
This review is a critical element of moderation. Believe me, when you confront 
people with specifics, such as when they have indicated that the payment sys-
tem is needed within 4 hours but the current disaster recovery time for the 
payment system is 24 hours, you quickly find out what is realistic, especially if 
they need to spend a lot of money to achieve a 4-hour recovery!
If you have discrepancies, revisit the BIA and make the necessary changes, then 
repeat the review meeting until everyone is satisfied with the findings.
Approve the BIA
Once the responsible manager has confirmed the findings, arrange to meet 
with the approving manager. The purpose of this meeting is a further review 
of the BIA conclusions to get the approving manager to sign them off as a true 
reflection of his or her area’s business continuity requirements.
This meeting can cover several BIAs, and it’s normal to get sign off for both 
the existing risk and for any necessary remediation work.
In this meeting, you are also ratifying the issues and agreeing on actions and 
ownership.
Conduct a Final Analysis
Once you have completed an individual BIA and reviewed and approved the 
outputs, then you’ll need to consolidate your findings into a single set of 
requirements in terms of recovery times. So, for example, you might have 
five BIAs that identify the same critical system, and thus you need to arrive 
at an overall requirement. Normally, this is the lowest requirement that gets 
inherited by all. So, if four areas need a system recovering within 24 hours of a 
disaster, but one needs it back in 4 hours, the requirement becomes 4 hours.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
41
Finalize or Close BIA
Once the final BIA report is produced, it is management’s responsibility to 
review the output, recommendations, and risks and then agree to a plan of 
action and formally accept any risks.
However, it’s your job to make sure this information gets suitably presented, 
with actions agreed upon and ownership put in place.
Analyzing the BIA
The output of an analysis can be thought of as a consolidated statement of 
what is required to survive a disaster.
The result is a catalog of resources, where the relative criticality of each 
resource is quantified and the recovery profile is set out as a recovery time 
objective (RTO) and a recovery point objective (RPO). In other words, every-
thing needed is listed with its overall RTO and RPO. Take, for example, a 
payment system. It might be used by 20 departments, and the recovery times 
could range from 5 days to 1 hour, with an acceptable data loss ranging from 
1 day to nothing. Assuming that we are looking for the lowest RTO and RPO, 
and there are two departments that list an RTO as low as 1 hour and  
10 departments have said they can’t lose any data; the final analysis of the pay-
ments system will give us an RTO of 1 hour and an RPO of 0 hours.
Generally, there are two methods you can use to take the output from the 
BIAs and arrive at a final set of requirements:
Weighted matrix analysis
• 
Threshold analysis
• 
Let’s take a deeper look at both.
Note
■
■
  Your goal with the final BIA is to create a document that shows what it takes to survive  
a disaster.
Weighted Matrix
The point of a weighted matrix is to show that not all questions are as impor-
tant as others, so the logic is that they shouldn’t carry the same weight when 
deciding on the final output of the BIA. For example, when calculating financial 
loss, you might decide that loss of revenue is more important than additional 
costs that may be incurred if an outage happened.

Chapter 3 | Getting Started
42
This is a simple methodology to adopt. First, you calculate a score for each 
attribute in the BIA. These attributes vary between my simple BIA and tra-
ditional BIAs. For the traditional BIA, they include impacts such as financial 
impact, processes impact, and systems availability. For the simpler BIA, they 
are things such as key activities, dependencies, outsourced services, systems, 
and manual workarounds.
The score is calculated by applying a weighting factor from one to five, with 
five being the most important, to each variable and then summing the overall 
score (Table 3-1).
Table 3-1. Weighted Matrix Example Based on Impacts
Financial Loss

Overall                                                2.4
This calculation is performed at a number of levels. First, you look at the indi-
vidual responses to questions and attach a weighting to calculate a score for 
the relevant impact you are considering (e.g., financial, legal, regulatory, etc.).
For example, consider the variable “lost revenue.” It contributes, on a tradi-
tional BIA, to the overall calculation of financial loss. In the BIA, the business 
may have indicated that the lost revenue would be “immediately” unaccept-
able, which for argument’s sake we might score a five. If you had decided that 
lost revenue is most important and given it a weighting of 0.4 (out of a total 
of 1.0 for all elements), then the weighted score would be two.
You can weigh the various impacts to arrive at a weighted score for the business 
function. When repeated for all business functions, it gives a weighted score 
for the whole BIA. You can also apply this to resources and dependencies.
To illustrate how weighting works, consider the simplified example presented 
in Table 3-1.
Again, the weights when added together equal one. So to decide the weight 
for an individual element, look at its relevant importance against the other 
elements being weighed. Represent this as a fraction of one.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
43
This example also illustrates a potential issue with weighting—that it can aver-
age out requirements. For example, lost revenue is scored at five in Table 3-1, 
which is the maximum. It makes sense—the levels of loss could be so massive 
they could take the whole business down. But this gets diluted, because it 
scores low on the other three elements that make up financial loss.
For this reason, I personally avoid using weighing and favor threshold analysis.
Threshold Analysis
The idea here is that you set thresholds and, if any particular impact exceeds 
the threshold, it establishes the requirement for a recovery time (Table 3-2).
Table 3-2.  Response and Impact for Threshold Analysis
Financial Loss

Impact/RTO

In this example, we have associated an RTO with each of the possible rankings, 
and these are listed in a lookup table (Table 3-3). So, a response that results 
in a score of five, such as lost revenue, would be translated into an RTO of  
2 hours.

Chapter 3 | Getting Started
44
The values you associate with the responses are relative to your business.  
So, for an investment bank, a score of five for revenue loss might reflect an order 
of a loss of more than $1.5 million in 2 hours. On the other hand, a retailer 
might adopt a loss of $100,000 in 12 hours as the criterion for a score of five 
response.
In practice, you’ll probably want to vary the criteria for each question, so for 
a financial loss, a five might give you a 2-hour RTO, whereas for fixed cost, 
a five might only be worth 12 hours. This holds true when you look at the 
same question but across different businesses. For an investment bank, a five 
in financial loss may equate to a 2-hour RTO, but a five for the retailer might 
be a 12-hour RTO.
So you can see that a major task is deciding on these thresholds and how 
you will vary them by question relevance. In general, this will be a reflection 
of your business’s attitude to risk and the relative materiality of the loss. For 
example, a $100,000 loss isn’t material in an investment bank, but it could be 
the difference between profit and loss for a retailer.
I favor threshold analysis because it avoids the problem of averaging out high 
impacts and makes it easy to associate a relevant RTO with a given response 
to a question.
Combining Thresholds with “First Past the Post”
Combining the threshold method with an element of “first past the post” 
is my preferred method. However, you can also use some weighting if you 
prefer.
First past the post simply means that the most significant output is adopted. For 
example, if any impact is as low as 2 hours, then the first time one is found that 
is that low, 2 hours becomes the requirement.
What we do with this approach is use the lowest response time as the overall 
RTO. So recall that in the previous example (Table 3-2) it would be “2 hours” 
for overall financial loss. This makes reporting later much simpler, as you’ll 
report on individual impacts or even functions rather than individual ques-
tions. Table 3-4 combines data for several attributes and totals them up for a 
final “score.”

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
45
What you see here is that the lowest RTO for each section is calculated based 
on the first-past-the-post method (i.e., the shortest response time [impact] is 
carried forward and becomes the standard for the whole BIA).
Risk Analysis
In addition to knowing what the critical functions, suppliers, and systems for 
your business are and how quickly they must be restored in a disaster, you will 
want to know the most likely things that could cause a disaster.
The way you do that is by completing a risk assessment, or as it’s sometimes 
called, a threat assessment.
Don’t get totally distracted by threats. Take it from me—they can be very 
distracting as there are an infinite number of possible threats. To help man-
age this, I always remind people that there is a small number of ways, say four, 
that the threat can actually manifest itself. For example, a threat can emerge 
as the loss of a building, the loss of staff, the loss of the technology that you 
depend on, or the loss of a supplier that you depend on. Consequently, for 
peace of mind and to spare yourself a lot of work, you should focus on these

possible outcomes based on the overall risk profile. In other words, if losing 
your head office building is the most likely event you will face, don’t focus on 
all the possible things that could cause the loss of this building. Mitigate the 
most pressing ones and generally safeguard the building, but focus particular 
attention on making sure you have a plan if the building is lost, not a plan for 
all the possible threats.
Note
■
■
  You may already have a risk assessment in place and it may have identified the principle 
risks to your business. In general, however, performing a risk assessment beyond the BIA is outside 
the scope of this book.
Once you have completed a risk assessment, you need to review the risks and 
decide how you will handle them.
Risk assessment needs to be taken into account when you look at your recov-
ery strategies and prioritize any investment in business continuity. If your head 
office and recovery site sit on the same flood plain or fault line, then you may 
decide that it’s a good idea to review the location of your offices and consider 
the possibility of a secondary recovery option or moving recovery to a facility 
that is out of that region because the risk of losing your primary and recovery 
site at the same time is too high.
Risk analysis also has two other key influences on business continuity. First, it 
feeds into your testing, in that you should test what is most likely to happen 
before you test the less likely scenarios. Second, if you have issues that need fix-
ing, you should prioritize fixing them based on risk and the ability to do the fix.
Doing a Risk Assessment
If you don’t already have access to a risk assessment, you will need to refer 
to your organization’s standard operational risk practices. Find out who is 
responsible for operational risk, and he or she will either be able to direct you 
to a completed assessment or provide you with a template.
A word of caution: it’s not for you to decide what risks exist for each business 
area—the business has to do that. It’s not even your responsibility to make 
sure that generic risk assessments are being done. However, you are respon-
sible for factoring the conclusions of any risk assessment into the choice of 
business continuity strategy and how to prioritize any remediation work.
Risk assessment should be a regular process. If you have any policies that 
cover this, adhere to what they recommend; if not, I recommend that your 
organization schedule a full risk assessment annually and review the risk log 

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
47
monthly to make sure that progress is being made. When reviewing risk logs, 
pay particular attention to confirm that actions are progressing to plan and 
any mitigating measures are still effective.
Acting on a Risk Assessment
Once you have identified the key risks, you need to decide on your risk  
strategy—what you’re going to do to manage the risks.
Basically, you have these options:
1.	 Mitigate the risk: Identify measures that can be under-
taken that will reduce the likelihood of a risk occurring 
or reduce the impact it will have if it does happen.
2.	 Insure: In some cases you can insure against the event 
occurring (e.g., if stock is destroyed).
3.	 Transfer: In some instances you can pass the risk on to 
another party (e.g., you may switch to a just-in-time pro-
cess so you only hold the minimum amount of inventory 
and hence the supplier keeps the risks). 
4.	 Accept the risk: The accountable manager needs to for-
mally accept the risk and acknowledge that you’re doing 
nothing about it.
“Sanity Test” Your Risk Strategy
However you decide to mitigate your risk, you have to ask, “Would we survive 
if this happened?”
For example, you may insure against a threat, but if it happened and you were 
compensated for the direct financial loss, but lost your customers and with it 
your long-term revenue stream, would you survive?
Likewise, you may transfer the risk to a partner or supplier, but if they failed 
would you survive? There might still be some risk if their inventory gets 
destroyed. You don’t own it. But it might mean that you can’t complete your 
critical activities because you don’t have the necessary inventory.
Residual Risk
You also need to assess what level of risk exists after you have put in place 
strategies for dealing with the risk.

Chapter 3 | Getting Started
48
Is this an acceptable level? If not, then you’ll need to consider additional mea-
sures. For example, you may have a recovery site, but it might be located in the 
same district or even city, which, given the possible events, is an unacceptable 
risk. So you’ll have to either have a secondary recovery site or change the 
location of the recovery site.
Action Plan
I’d recommend you look at the following actions now:
1.	 If you have a BIA process, does it follow the steps identi-
fied in Figure 3-1? If not, review these steps and decide if 
you need to change your process.
2.	 What methodology do you use for analyzing the BIA data: 
weighted matrix, threshold analysis, or perhaps some-
thing else? Regardless of your method, it should provide 
a consistent way of comparing the data and deciding the 
relative criticality. If it doesn't, then you need to rethink 
your methodology.
3.	 Has the business completed a risk assessment and is this 
a regular part of the business lifecycle? If not, then you 
need to integrate risk assessment into your processes.

Planning
Preparing the Plan
You’ve identified what’s critical in your business, the systems you need to keep 
up and running, and how quickly everything must be done. Next you need a 
plan that brings it all together.
The business continuity plan (BCP) details what you’ll need to do to keep 
your business running or get it back up and running in a disaster. As well as 
specific actions, it has all the contact details and other essential information 
that will get you through the first few hours.
This chapter sets out the structure of a business continuity plan and helps you 
write yours.
What a Business Continuity Plan Should 
Include
While a BCP must cover a few essentials common to all such plans, you can 
be pretty flexible with the order and contents. The acid test is the question 
“What do you need when it’s 3 a.m., you have no access to your IT infrastruc-
ture, and you’ve just gotten a call to say the building has burned down?”
Can you pick up your BCP and in a few moments be doing the correct 
things?
It should be no surprise then that the organization of the content should reflect 
how the plan will be used. That typically means arranging the content chrono-
logically, so the first thing you need to do is documented in the plan first.

Essential Ingredients of a BCP

tion, situation, and so on, but I recommend you include the following topics in  
your plan:

Other Content to Put in Your BCP
Use your judgment for your particular situation, but I suggest including the 
following topics in your plan (or at least your planning file):
• 
Department/business overview: Describe what you do in 
terms of the business process, inputs and outputs, and 
how you typically interact with suppliers and customers.
• 
Key systems: List your key systems, any workarounds you 
can employ while a system is down, and IT contact details. 
You might feel this is essential and belongs in the previous 
list, especially if you are heavily dependent on your IT.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
51
• 
Maintenance/administration: Keep a record of changes to 
the plan. You might also want to describe your main-
tenance plan for the document—how often it will be 
reviewed and by whom. Cover how it will be distributed. 
Also, think about its relationship to other business pro-
cesses. For example, you’ll want to say how soon the plan 
will be reviewed and updated after you do a business 
impact analysis (BIA).
• 
Testing: Set out how the plan will be tested, such as that 
you will do a call cascade test yearly, a desktop walk-
through annually, a technology and end-user test annu-
ally, and so on. (I will be covering all these tests in other 
chapters of the book.)
• 
Approval: Keep a record of approvals required and received. 
Cover who, what, and when.
Before addressing the items you might include in your plan, make sure you 
have the essentials covered. You never know when disaster might strike, and 
you’ll look incompetent if the only thing in your plan is “Business Overview” 
and “Maintenance.”
Tip
■
■
  Cover the essentials ingredients of a BCP first, before any of the add-ons just listed. Again, 
it’s important that the core of your plan provides the who, what, where, when, and how of getting your 
key processes and systems up and running again.
Structuring Your BCP
The structure of your plan may be simple, and as a result, you need only a 
single BCP for a location or even the whole business. However, in most orga-
nizations, the BCP is actually a hierarchy of BCPs.
You may need to have separate BCPs for each department or for each loca-
tion or you may want to have business BCPs for each department and sepa-
rate ones for support functions such as IT.
In fact, how you organize the plans is of little importance. What matters is that 
the people who need to use the BCPs are able to use them successfully and 
painlessly. Whatever the structure, this is your aim.
If you have multiple BCPs, it’s the responsibility of the crisis management team 
in the event of a disaster to decide when each BCP gets invoked. They will 
also monitor progress and make sure that the recovery activities across differ-
ent BCPs and different parts of the business are coordinated.

Chapter 4 | Planning
52
WRITE YOUR PLAN
Probably the most important thing is that you get the basics down. If a disaster strikes 
tomorrow, you'll know you can get through it somehow.
To get you started, I’ve provided a basic BCP template in Appendix H. In many cases, 
you can just fill it in and have a workable plan. It should take only a few minutes to get 
the basics documented. Larger and more complex businesses will need to adapt the 
template or come up with something customized for their situation.
Identify What Will Trigger Your BCP
Whatever is in your BCP, it’s critical that you act quickly and make sure all the 
people tasked with recovery actions remain coordinated.
For this to be possible, you will need a clear escalation process with clearly 
defined trigger points. It’s not important to know the exact events that will 
trigger the plan. However, you will need to develop an enduring awareness in 
the organization of potentially disastrous events and a corresponding capabil-
ity to assess the nature, impact, and need for a crisis response.
I'll have more to say on incident management and escalation in Chapter 16.
Once you have triggered an emergency response, you can direct the recovery 
activities virtually using conference bridge lines and similar technologies, or 
you may—if possible—convene as a team at a convenient location. I recom-
mend getting together; it makes it easier to share information, and things can 
get missed over the phone.
When writing a BCP, keep in mind the circumstances that will force you to 
use it. Always keep your BCP as short as possible, easy to use, and available 
where it will be needed.
This last point needs expanding. Obviously, a plan is a complete waste if you 
can’t get your hands on it when the moment of truth arrives. So, make sure 
you have an up-to-date copy at home, in the recovery site, and at your desk.
Tip
■
■
  Keep a copy of the BCP at home just in case you get that late-night call and your office is 
inaccessible.
Create Battle Boxes and Grab Bags
There two items you should have accessible in case of a disaster are “battle 
boxes” and “grab bags.”

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
53
The battle box is located at recovery locations and contains any essential 
equipment or resources. These can include things such as specialist sta­tionery, 
hard copies of plans or directories, and any other resources that will be 
needed at the recovery site until you can make it back into the office.
I recommend you keep the battle boxes restricted to departmental resources 
and have one box per department. In addition to this, you should have generic 
stationery and other useful equipment stored centrally at the recovery site 
ready for everyone to share.
The grab bag is simply a small bag with essentials in it, such as the crisis plan 
and contacts list, that you can pick up on the way out—held by reception or 
security until it’s needed—when you are forced to leave a building.
Create a One-Page Wallet Plan
I recommend creating a one-page (double-sided) summary version of your 
BCP. You can keep this in your wallet and have it with you at all times. You 
might differentiate this from the broader BCP and call it something like the 
invocation, wallet, or page plan.
I can tell you from experience that having a handy, easy-to-use plan has proved 
invaluable, especially at 4 a.m. when I’ve been awakened by a call and people 
expect me to know what to do and whom to call.
The following are key items for the wallet plan:
BCP checklist—steps to take immediately on being  
• 
notified of a potential incident
Key contacts
• 
Recovery site directions
• 
Your cascade numbers—whom you have to call
• 
Mitigate Risk
Your BIA will have highlighted a number of risks. You need to make sure senior 
management recognizes each of these and does either of the following:
Put in place some strategies to mitigate the risk. That can 
• 
be done through disaster recovery procedures, creating 
alternative work space, identifying alternative suppliers, 
or ensuring against the event happening.
Accept the risk. That means understanding that a risk 
• 
might occur and being prepared to absorb the fallout 
from an event.

Chapter 4 | Planning
54
Much of the rest of this book deals with mitigating strategies. As you deliver 
new strategies, you need to make sure that the BCP gets updated with some 
corresponding new critical activities. In other words, if you implement disaster 
recovery (DR) for your customer database, add some instructions to your 
critical activities plan to cover this.
Note
■
■
  The details for IT recovery should be in a specific IT plan for that service or system, though 
these might be considered part of the broader business continuity planning activities.
Identify Roles
Critical to success is having clear roles associated with your BCP.  These 
should be recorded in your key contact list.
For guidance, I suggest the following roles at a minimum:
• 
Business recovery manager: This is the person responsible 
for leading the recovery of your part of the business—
the person executing the business continuity plan.
• 
Crisis management liaison: If your plan is one of many being 
centrally coordinated by a crisis management team, some-
one in each recovery team will need to liaise with the crisis 
management team. This person will report progress, issues, 
and risks and take instructions. This will normally involve 
joining crisis management team meetings or calls, provid-
ing updates, and negotiating any actions. The job is often 
undertaken by the business recovery manager, though be 
careful not to give that person too much to do.
• 
Lines of business: You will normally have representation 
from the different lines of business covered by the plan. 
They will execute their part of the plan as directed by 
the business recovery manager and report progress and 
issues to that person.
• 
IT: You may want to have an IT manager to oversee the 
recovery of your IT services and provide the business 
recovery manager with updates regarding potential busi-
ness impacts, time lines for recovery, and so on.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
55
• 
Support: I advise you have some people available to pro-
vide support activities ranging from recording events, 
decisions, issues, and risks on whiteboards to acting as 
runners to find out information or pass instruction to 
other teams.
• 
HR: You might want someone as part of your recovery 
team who is dedicated to managing staff issues such as 
overall welfare, remuneration, attention to injuries, and 
so on. It could be a dedicated HR specialist who could 
take on many of the responsibilities, or it may be a person 
tasked with liaising with the HR team and passing infor-
mation to the business recovery manager. This may not 
be necessary if these responsibilities are covered by the 
crisis management team.
• 
Communications: You may also find it useful to have some-
one dedicated to preparing any internal or external com-
munications. Again, this may be a liaison role with the 
communication being prepared and delivered centrally 
via the crisis management team.
• 
Supplier management: You may need someone to liaise 
with your suppliers.
Don’t get hung up on the titles or even seeing these roles as being different 
people; just make sure all of the associated responsibilities are covered.
If you have the luxury of having a central crisis management team, it’s normal 
for them to take responsibility for things such as HR, internal and external 
communications, security, and facilities.
Have Accountable Managers Approve Plans
I strongly recommend your BCP is reviewed by the accountable manager 
annually and following any major changes in the organization, systems, or facili-
ties. This should include a formal sign-off on the latest version of the plan.  
I also suggest making sure you give everyone with a recovery role the latest 
version of the plan and ask them to review and approve it.

Chapter 4 | Planning
56
Action Plan
Please reflect on the following questions or suggestions and consider how you 
will implement any recommendations:
1.	 Review your BCP, taking into account the points in the sec-
tion “What a Business Continuity Plan Should Include.”
2.	 Is your business continuity plan written in a way that 
makes it easy to use? A good test is to imagine that it’s 
3 a.m. and you’ve just been called out of bed. Can you 
locate your BCP immediately and know instantly what to 
do next? If not, look at how it’s structured, the level of 
detail, and so on, and decide how it can be improved so 
that it would pass this test.
3.	 Do you have a one-page plan for people to keep in their 
wallets?
4.	 Do you really need most of the things that come out 
of the business continuity planning process in the physi-
cal plan? Can you strip some of them out of your plan 
to keep things simple and doable? You can always keep 
important but not essential advice or procedures in elec-
tronic format.
5.	 Where information isn’t needed in the physical plan and 
has been removed, can it be accessed by the people who 
need it in a timely fashion? For example, can the IT spe-
cialists get their detailed recovery instruction? Similarly, 
do the business people have access to their work instruc-
tions once they arrive at the recovery site?
6.	 Do you need things stored where you can grab them 
quickly either as you leave the office or as you arrive at 
the recovery center?
7.	 Does your business continuity plan set out clear roles? If 
not, you should identify who will be leading the recovery 
activity and who will be available to undertake the recov-
ery steps.
8.	 Does someone review and approve the plan contents, 
and if so, are they the right people?

IT Disaster 
Recovery
An Overview of IT Disaster Recovery
IT disaster recovery, or DR for short, is the side of business continuity that 
deals with protecting and recovering your critical IT services. This chapter 
explains the basic concepts of DR and tells you what you’ll need to do to set 
it up and keep it running. Besides basic strategies for keeping your IT up and 
running, I provide basic definitions of the concepts all managers involved with 
business continuity should understand, along with tips on identifying risks and 
creating a DR plan that has the approval of top managers.
What Is DR?
IT DR refers to both the way that systems are protected from a disaster and 
the process that is followed to recover them in a disaster.
DR predates business continuity and was something that IT people started 
to think about quite soon after computers started being used for commercial 
applications. What they realized, as organizations became ever more depen-
dent on their systems, was that they needed a way to get the business back up 
and running if the computer went down.
The main scenario they identified was the computer network failing and not 
recoverable at the site that it normally runs from.

Chapter 5 | IT Disaster Recovery
58
In practical terms, it’s almost always preferable to recover the production 
system in situ rather than switching operations to a DR machine, which might 
be located hundreds or even thousands of miles away. However, you have to 
face the real possibility that the primary site is not available.
Risks and Issues Associated with DR
There are often risks and issues associated with running information systems 
in DR mode. The biggest risk is that for some unforeseen reason your DR 
solution won’t work. In addition, there’s the risk associated with switching 
physical systems between the production environment and the DR environment. 
You could lose data or corrupt it.
You also need to weigh the level of service that you will receive when you 
attempt to deliver your production services from the disaster recovery  
system. It’s quite common for the DR system to have a smaller capacity 
machine that has been sized to run just essential work.
Finally, there are the risks associated with the switch back to production, or 
“normal operations” as I will call it. These are similar to those associated with 
invoking DR: loss of data, data corruption, service outages, and in the worst 
case a complete failure to be able to resume “normal operations” from your 
regular production environment.
DR Solutions for IT
There’s a wide range of DR solutions. These solutions are driven by business 
requirements such as recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point 
objective (RPO) and by constraints such as budget and location and how 
much you are willing or able to afford.
Broadly speaking, solutions can be broken down into the following categories:
Hot standby
• 
Warm recovery
• 
Cold recovery
• 
Resilience
• 
Mobile recovery
• 
Let’s look at each one in more depth; note that later in the chapter I define 
some terms that might be familiar to IT professionals but perhaps not to 
managers in other areas.

59
Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
Hot Standby
As the name suggests, this is ready-to-go DR. Basically you have the production 
environment reproduced at your DR site in a constant state of readiness. The 
hardware is adequately sized to run production work, the operating system is 
up and running, the data is an exact copy (within a second) of production, and 
the applications are ready to take over production work.
Hot Standby Architectures
Providing such a high level of service requires the following:
Replicated data
• 
Replicated hardware
• 
Replicated software
• 
Running in ready state
• 
Normally in-house
• 
Live/passive
• 
Mirrored data
• 
Rapid/automated failover
• 
Hot Standby Capability
Recovery time varies from a few seconds, if you adopt a fully automated  
solution, to a few hours if you have to include management sanction and  
manual intervention. This is often more a matter of your organizational culture 
than the technology. Data loss is normally down to 1 second or less.
Hot Standby Costs and Complexity
Hot standby is complex and may have geographic constraints. For example, 
data centers may need to be within 15 miles (25 kilometers) of each other 
if you need to support synchronous data replication. This is applicable to 
architectures where the data must be written to both sites, and the writes 
must be confirmed before the next transaction can be performed.
This architectural constraint is normally linked to the specific application that 
will have to be written as a synchronous application. Note that this is not a 
trivial application constraint that can be changed easily!

Chapter 5 | IT Disaster Recovery
60
By contrast, with asynchronous applications you write the data to the DR 
computer but don’t wait for confirmation before continuing. This type of DR 
capability lends itself to separation over larger distances. Such systems are 
called geographically dispersed.
Costs for hot standby are high because it requires a dedicated solution that is 
maintained as part of the production environment.
Hot Standby Benefits
Hot standby has many benefits, including the following:
Almost no loss of data
• 
Nonstop potential for your operations to continue produc-
• 
tion work when essential maintenance is being undertaken 
on the production environment
Reduced manual intervention, which means reduced risk
• 
High reliability
• 
Low risk of failure during invocation because you are 
• 
dealing with a known architecture and a limited number 
of steps to recover it
Warm Recovery
Warm recovery is similar to hot standby in that the hardware is config-
ured ready to run the main production workload. In other words, the 
operating system and applications are maintained in a state of readiness 
on the DR machine.
By ready, I mean maintained and up to date, but offline and without all the lat-
est application data loaded. Warm recovery systems are generally offline and 
need to be rebooted, and all the applications need to be started from scratch. 
In general, the data also needs some manual intervention before production 
work can begin, which further adds to the delays and risk.
It’s normal practice to maximize the use of warm recovery hardware. For 
example, when hardware is not being used for production work as part of 
DR, it is used to run noncritical work such as development, testing, and so on. 
This maximizes the use of expensive hardware. However, it adds to recovery 
time because the noncritical workload needs to be closed down and the DR 
environment brought up.
Obviously, warm recovery solutions must be adequate to run the projected 
volumes in DR mode. Bear in mind, though, that in DR the volumes may be 
considerably less than you’d normally run. In some cases, however, they can be 

61
Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
higher because you may have to cope with a large amount of pent-up demand 
that has been building during the outage.
Typical warm recovery characteristics include the following:
Replicated hardware, generally offline and used for  
• 
noncritical workload.
Software built ready to go. This should be change  
• 
controlled as part of the production environment. 
Normally, the software is not running between events.
Mirrored data, data vault, or tape-based data (perhaps 
• 
virtual).
Warm recovery solutions are often provided by specialist third parties. This is 
cheaper but reduces the level of control or your ability to test.
Warm Recovery Capabilities
Typical RTOs for warm recovery are normally greater than 4 hours and  
typically 8–12 hours. This depends principally on the data and how it’s restored. 
If you need to restore data from tapes, this process can take days.
It’s critical that you know exactly how much data you have and how long 
this would take to load in a recovery scenario. Testing systems in isolation 
may not be an accurate guide because you have to factor in the impact of 
potentially having to recover many applications in parallel, which will lead 
to conflicts and contention between applications all trying to use the same  
hardware, networks, and people.
Data loss, or the recovery point objective, depends on the specific architecture. 
If mirroring is used, it can be as low as a second. This depends on how the 
mirroring is configured. If restoration is tape based, the RPO depends on 
the frequency of backups and when the data was taken off-site.
Warm Recovery Cost and Complexity
The architecture for warm recovery is less complex than hot recovery or 
resilient solutions, but it can often be more complex to invoke because it 
requires more manual intervention and consequently presents more potential 
areas that can fail.
Overall, no DR is cheap, but warm recovery is significantly cheaper than hot 
standby. You simply need to balance the costs against the risks.

Chapter 5 | IT Disaster Recovery
62
Warm Recovery Risks
Because of the level of manual intervention required and the need to coordi-
nate recovery actions across a number of different IT and business disciplines, 
the risk of either failing to recover or experiencing delays is medium to high.
There are also significant risks of data loss when data recovery is dependent 
on tapes. The key risks are that backup tapes remain on-site and therefore 
not available. Another risk is that one of the tapes is unreadable, rendering the 
whole set unreadable and forcing you to recover from an earlier set.
Regular testing and training are critical to the viability of warm solutions. Also 
important is the backup strategy adopted and consequently how an overall 
recovery is affected if a single tape is unreadable.
Tip
■
■
  Ask yourself, “What would be the outcome if this backup tape failed when DR has 
been invoked?” If tape failure is unacceptable in any scenario, you’ll need to invest in a more 
robust solution.
Warm Recovery Benefits
Warm recovery benefits include the following:
Lower costs
• 
More likely to work than cold recovery
• 
Quicker than cold recovery
• 
Third-party services are possible, possibly removing the 
• 
need for a DR site
Cold Recovery
Unlike hot recovery and warm recovery strategies, cold recovery doesn’t 
have any hardware or software prepared or ready to run.
Generally, the hardware is allocated. In other words, it is on the floor in the 
data center and has required power and network connectivity. However,  
the hardware needs to be configured. The operating systems and applications 
are often built but are probably not loaded. Last but not least, the application 
data will also require loading onto the cold recovery configuration’s storage.
Overall, cold recovery requires a lot of manual work. From experience, I can 
tell you that you may find that the actual configuration that is used on the 

63
Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
day you need it is not the same as was last tested. So, you need to be mind-
ful that the configuration you end up working with is to a degree untested. 
Consequently, you should expect unanticipated delays.
Cold recovery is often provided by third-party specialist companies, and as 
such it reduces the cost and need to maintain an extra data center. However, 
you lose flexibility and control over when you can test and, in particular, retest. 
You also miss out on the opportunity to leverage your DR environment for 
other uses, such as testing and development.
Cold Recovery Architecture
The architecture for a cold recovery configuration is simple, especially if a 
third-party solution is required. In general, the DR configuration should be 
adequate to run the projected volumes of work in a DR situation. Remember 
that in DR the volumes may be considerably less than you’d normally run. 
However, they can be higher because you may have to cope with a large 
amount of pent-up demand that has built up during the outage.
The cold recovery system must also be able to run the latest production oper-
ating system and applications. There are plenty of examples of where people 
have invoked their DR plan only to find that the hardware is no longer able to 
run the production system, which has been upgraded since the last test.
If you’re using third-party solutions, keep in mind they are normally provided 
using a pool of available hardware and consequently will vary on the day based 
on what’s available.
Third-party DR suppliers make their money by selling the use of their 
equipment to multiple parties, and it’s your responsibility to make sure 
that your software will run on the available configuration. Don’t think for a 
minute that because you’ve outsourced the delivery you have outsourced 
the responsibility to make sure it works!
Tape or data vault requires lengthy data recovery, and there is a high level of 
manual intervention required to recover cold solutions.
Note
■
■
  Just because you have outsourced a recovery solution to a third party doesn’t mean you 
have outsourced the responsibility you have to ensure it works the way you want it.
Cold Recovery Capability
The recovery time depends on how the data is recovered and how much of it 
there is. However, if you are using a third party or run noncritical work on the 

Chapter 5 | IT Disaster Recovery
64
hardware during normal operations, there will be a period of up to four hours 
to clear down the environment. In the case of third-party solutions, they will 
make this a specific time on the contract. For example, it may say you will not 
be allowed access to the facility or environment for at least four hours.
Data loss, or the recovery point objective (RPO), depends on the specific 
architecture. If data vaulting or mirroring is used, the RPO can be as low as a 
second. This depends on how the mirroring is configured. However, if a tape-
based architecture is used, then it depends on the frequency of backups and 
how quickly the tapes are taken off-site.
Cold Recovery Cost and Complexity
The architecture for cold recovery is the least complex, but it is more com-
plex to invoke because of more manual intervention, significant logistical 
challenges such as moving tapes, and getting access to third-party locations. 
Consequently, there more potential points at which you can fail.
Overall, no DR solution is cheap, but this is significantly cheaper than hot or 
warm standby. If your organization owns its own cold recovery DR hardware, 
rather than using a third-party DR service, you can use it to run noncritical 
work such as development, testing, and nonessential business applications. 
This can further reduce costs and help with the business case.
Cold Recovery Risks
Because of the high level of manual intervention and the need to coordinate 
recovery actions across a number of IT teams, business departments, and 
third parties, the risk of failure to recover or experience delays is high.
As with warm recovery, there are also risks of data loss if you depend on 
tape. If you do, make sure backups exist off-site and test to ensure they work 
as you expect them to work. If a tape is unreadable, you will have to recover 
from an earlier set.
Regular testing and training are critical to the viability of cold solutions. 
However, where third parties are used, this is often difficult. For example, 
you may get only one guaranteed test slot per year, and additional test slots  
(if available) come at a high cost.
Complexity and Cost of Cold Recovery
Cold recovery means a simple architecture. However, it will require significant 
levels of manual intervention and is consequently prone to issues because 
each invocation often utilizes a unique configuration.

65
Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
Again, you have to bear in mind that if you are putting the hardware to 
non-DR uses, it will take time to close down. Also, you have to assess how 
long you can go without whatever it is that is being replaced by DR.
Cold Recovery Benefits
Cold recovery has a number of benefits, including the following:
Lowest costs
• 
Using a third party can remove the need for a dedicated 
• 
DR site and associated costs
If dedicated hardware is used, then you can reduce the 
• 
overall costs further by running a noncritical workload 
when in standby in case of a disaster
Resilience
Resilience isn’t a disaster recovery strategy. Rather, it is a way of avoiding the 
need for DR in a number of scenarios. Specifically, it can avoid the impact of 
localized component failures. For example, if the resilient solution is to split 
services between two data center halls each with independent power, air 
conditioning, and network connectivity, you can avoid a loss of service in the 
event that a single data center is lost.
However, a solution like this doesn’t necessarily remove the need for DR.
Often, resilience is provided within the same data center, and as such, the 
solution is exposed to the consequences of localized failures such as loss of 
power, cooling, communications, buildings, people, or shared infrastructure.
However, given a lower likelihood of a failure, you may decide to spend less on 
your DR solution. For example, you might adopt a warm recovery capability 
rather than hot standby if you have a highly resilient production machine on 
the basis that the risk of needing to invoke is much lower.
To make this decision, you need to be led by the facts and in particular know 
how long you can survive without the service. If you need to have a service 
back quicker than is possible with warm recovery, it becomes something of  
a no-brainer to move to hot standby.
Resilient architectures can be thought of as one of a number of possibilities:
Nonstop fault tolerant
• 
Live/live, geographically dispersed
• 
Live/live, locally dispersed
• 

Chapter 5 | IT Disaster Recovery
66
Live/passive, geographically dispersed
• 
Live/passive, locally dispersed
• 
I will discuss each in turn in the coming pages.
Resiliency Risks
Though resiliency solutions reduce the likelihood of an outage, it doesn’t 
eliminate the possibility. You can still lose power, communications, and other 
things that will affect the whole system. For this reason, resilience is, as we just 
discussed, generally used in combination with DR. Though, given the overall 
benefits of resilience, you may decide to spend less on DR and have a slower 
DR strategy.
Resilience Costs and Complexity
Recent years have seen the costs of resilience reducing rapidly as the underly-
ing costs of components have become commoditized. This is being accelerated as 
operating systems and applications provide increased support for resilience. 
As a simple rule of thumb, you should probably multiply the build/implementation 
costs by a factor of three over a nonresilient architecture. However, the run 
costs are probably slightly greater than double.
In many instances, the benefits are so significant from a purely operational point 
of view that the cost case stands up without factoring in business continuity.
Benefits of a Resilient Architecture
The benefits of increased resiliency include the following:
Increased system availability
• 
No downtime for component maintenance
• 
No outages when components fail
• 
Table 5-1 sums up the differences of the approaches just discussed.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
Mobile Recovery
Mobile recovery covers a range of solutions. Instead of relying on a traditional 
data center to host your recovered site, you use a temporary solution that is 
moved to your desired location.
These come in a variety of shapes and sizes ranging from trailers that are 
towed to your site to extensive mobile data centers that are built on-site.
They require that you have adequate space to park the mobile recovery facil-
ity and, ideally, access to network and utilities.
Mobile recovery is an option offered by most DR solutions providers. I’m not 
aware of anyone who has their own in-house mobile solution.
Like shared DR, these solutions are syndicated between a number of clients 
so aren’t normally configured ready to go. The trailer-based solutions are nor-
mally configured at the time of invocation but before leaving the depot.
Mobile Recovery Risks
Many risks are associated with this sort of a strategy, and many will be unique 
to your deployment.
However, the key risks are as follows:
A solution is invoked by another client when you want 
• 
to use it. (This is a significant risk if, say, a number of busi-
nesses are affected by the same flood.)
The supplier is unable to get the mobile recovery solu-
• 
tion to your site, perhaps because of the event that is 
causing your outage.
There’s a technology failure and delays are longer than 
• 
traditional DR because required components or special-
ists are not available at the recovery location.
The planned location for your mobile recovery is not 
• 
available at the time of recovery.
Basic DR Concepts and Technology
Let’s take a step back and look at some of the basic concepts all IT people 
and business recovery managers should know when it comes to IT disaster 
recovery.

Chapter 5 | IT Disaster Recovery
68
Mirroring
Mirroring is a disk-based technology that creates a mirror (identical) copy of 
your production data on a secondary disk system. The mirrored disks can be 
at a remote data center.
Asynchronous mirroring means that the mirror is written independently of 
the main disks. In other words, the application doesn’t have to wait until both 
the main and mirror disks are updated before it does the next thing.
Synchronous mirroring means that the application that is updating the disk 
has to wait for the mirror as well as the main disk to confirm that the update 
was successful before it can continue. This wait time can become an issue 
as distance between the main disk and mirror increases the time it takes to 
transfer the data. The increased time delay can seriously undermine perfor-
mance and in many cases can cause the system to time out.
Consistency Groups
An issue with recovering distributed systems is that application or services 
data may be backed up to a different point in time. As a result, when you 
recover everything, or even a single failed component, you can have discrepan-
cies between the services backups that make up the whole system.
Consistency groups provide a useful solution for this by ensuring all the rel-
evant services data is recovered to the same point in time so that you will 
never have a situation where, say, a transaction was reflected in one part of a 
distributed system but not in another. For example, if a transaction is visible 
on the ledger but not on the order book, this leads to problems of reconcili-
ation and puts the data integrity of the whole system into doubt. When you 
implement a consistency group, you know all the data is recovered to the 
same point in time.
Tape-Based Recovery
Used for decades, physical tapes store data and are used, if needed, to restore 
it. With modern disk systems, physical tapes are not normally the primary 
mechanism these days for ensuring data recovery or integrity, but if there are 
data integrity issues or the failure is catastrophic, they are a useful secondary 
resource.
There are different strategies for backing up data, and these strategies are 
important to understand when it comes to tape. There can be significant 
repercussions in terms of backup duration and the potential for losing data.
The keys to tape backup and consequently your ability to recover are fre-
quency and backup strategy employed. For example, how long do you go 

69
Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
between backups? Do you use differential or incremental backup? What’s 
your policy on removing tapes from the site? All are key factors.
Backup frequency is something you need to give serious thought to. The key 
question is, how much data can you afford to lose? If it’s one day’s worth, you 
can afford to have just one daily backup, and so forth.
Backup strategy is a balance between operational efficiency when taking 
backups and the integrity of data when you recover. Your choice here is dif-
ferential or incremental backups.
Differential backups record all the changes since the last full backup each time 
a backup is run. This means that to recover fully, you need only the last set of 
tapes from the last full backup and the tapes from the last differential backup. 
The downside is that you need to use more tapes and more time each time 
you run a backup.
Incremental backups save only the changes since the last incremental. This is 
a much quicker backup to run because it saves far less data and writes less 
tape. However, to restore the data, you need the last full backup set and every 
incremental backup tape, too. If any incremental tapes are unreadable, the 
whole restoration is at risk.
The strategy for removing backup tapes off-site is critical so that the tapes 
are both quickly accessible and not still in the building when something 
goes wrong.
Tip
■
■
  Create a firm policy for removing backup tapes and identifying who will do so, when, and 
where the tapes will end up. If the worst happens and your backup tapes go up in flames, your 
troubles have only just begun.
Virtual Tape
This is a disk system that acts and is accessed just like a tape system. It has a 
number of advantages over tape, including speed, physical storage space (no 
need for extensive rack space in physical libraries), no wasted tapes, and no 
mechanical delays while tapes are found, loaded, and read.
Virtual tape also makes it possible to create, update, and delete virtual tapes 
that are at a secondary location if, say, your backups are off-site and therefore 
secure at the point of creation.
Tape-only solutions are becoming less common, and virtual tape is replacing 
many enterprise backup solutions. However, virtual tape still relies on physical 
tape as the ultimate backup medium. That’s because virtual tape is itself only 
a backup to tape.

Chapter 5 | IT Disaster Recovery
70
Cross-Site Tape
This is where the physical tape system is at a remote location. For example, 
your backups are off-site and therefore secure at the point of creation. It can 
be used in combination with virtual tape so that you are in fact writing to a 
virtual tape device at the remote site.
Backups
There are three basic strategies for backing up: full, incremental, and differential.
Full Backup
Full backup is where all the data, not just the things that have changed since the 
last backup, gets saved. It can be quite a long process and sometimes difficult 
to complete in the available time. Recovering all the data is simpler, however, 
because you just need to read the full backup.
Incremental Backups
Incremental backup describes a process where you save only the things that 
have changed since the last backup. This is much quicker. However, restoring 
all the data requires that the last full backup is read, and then all the incre-
mental backups have to be read to restore all the data to its latest state. If any 
backups are missing, the whole process can fail, and you have to revert to the 
last complete set of data.
Differential Backups
Differential backup is where every change that has been made since the last 
full save is saved. This takes longer than an incremental but has the advantage 
that when it comes time to restore the data, you need to read only the last 
differential plus the last full backup.
Live/Live
Live/live refers to an architecture where the processing is split between two 
physical machines that are independent in the sense that one machine can 
continue to work without the other. Live/live architectures vary; in some 
instances, the actual work is done on both in parallel or is routed to which-
ever part of the whole architecture is most convenient.

71
Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
Checkpoints
A checkpoint is a system process that allows you to capture the current 
state of an application so that it can be recovered to the checkpoint if 
required. It’s not useful in a DR situation but could be useful for restoring 
localized problems.
Transaction Logs
Transaction logs are files that record all the transactions that have taken place 
and can be stored off-site. They are used to reprocess all the work that has 
been completed since the last backup. If the transaction logs are available at 
the DR site, they can be used to recover a given application back to the last 
recorded transaction, not just the last backup. In other words, the application 
can be recovered to within seconds of a disaster, not the start of day. If disk 
mirroring is employed, then the value of transaction logs is greatly reduced.
Nonstop Fault Tolerant
This architecture emerged as a commercial proposition in the early 1980s 
as a solution for running high availability services like ATMs in banking. The 
basic idea is that every component in the system is duplicated such that if a 
component fails, the system continues running by instantly switching to the 
backup component.
Increasingly, this is a standard architectural feature where within each com-
ponent there is resilience built in and the whole system is designed with 
redundancy built in.
Geographically Dispersed Live/Live
This means that the system is configured such that it extends across two or 
more sites that are geographically removed from each other. However, unlike hot 
recovery and live/passive, both sites undertake production work. Ideally, all sites 
should have independent power, water, and communications and not share the 
same threats—such as they are both in a city center location prone to flooding.
It’s normal for a geographically dispersed system to be located at two sites, 
and I’ve worked on that assumption in this section. But it is possible to have 
more than two sites or “nodes,” as they are sometimes known.
The configuration needs to be sized such that either site can take on a full 
workload. Normally, the workload is split between either site, and data is 
recorded at both. Figure 5-1 provides a visual description.

Chapter 5 | IT Disaster Recovery
72
Figure 5-1.  Resilient architecture
As Figure 5-1 shows, work can be executed at either site, depending on avail-
able resources. So if the primary site is busy, it will be done at the secondary 
site. When records are changed, created, or deleted, the action takes place 
on both sites. However, exactly how this is done may vary; both disks might 
be written to at the same time, or the local disk might be written to first and 
then the second site soon after.
Normally any failover—switching from one computer to another if there’s a 
problem—will be invisible to the end users because the workload simply gets 
routed to the available node.
The system should be configured so that a single node has enough capacity 
to support peak volumes, and the users shouldn’t even experience significant 
performance degradation.
Bringing the failed node back online should also be transparent to the users.

73
Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
Locally Dispersed Live/Live
This is similar to geographically dispersed live/live except that the solu-
tion resides in a single data center. It looks exactly like the diagram of the 
geographically dispersed service in Figure 5-1 except the nodes are in the 
same location.
Sometimes each node will reside in a different data hall. If possible, they 
should have independent power, cooling, and communications, so if you 
lose supply from one source, the other node will continue running using its 
independent supply.
Geographically Dispersed Live/Passive
This is similar to the geographically dispersed live/live, but live work is not 
processed on both legs. The primary node is live and does all the work; the 
other is in a state of readiness to take over if the live leg fails. It’s like hot 
standby except there’s not a separate DR machine. It’s all part of the same 
machine, under the control of the same operating system.
Data is processed on the live node and recorded to both sites. There may 
be some lag between the live and passive nodes, and it is possible to lose the 
odd transaction. Failover is normally automated and occurs with almost no 
impact on the users, who will probably be totally unaware. Both legs should 
have exactly the same capacity and configurations.
Locally Dispersed Live/Passive
This is similar to the geographically dispersed live/passive, but both nodes are 
hosted in the same dame data center. Ideally, like its geographically dispersed 
equivalent, each node will reside in a different data hall within the data cen-
ter. If possible, each node should have independent power, cooling, and com-
munications; so if you lost supply from one source, the other source would 
continue running.
DR Roles and Responsibilities
Roles and responsibilities in a DR situation change from organization to 
organization depending on many local factors including structure, size, and 
industry. The following is not definitive but sets out the high-level responsi-
bilities and roles.

DR and Projects
It’s probable that when you understand business requirements in terms of 
systems recovery and then compare this to what is currently possible, there 
will be gaps. In a quarter of a century of working for some of the biggest and 
most risk-averse organizations, I’ve never worked anywhere that didn’t have 
gaps! To address this, the gap needs to be formalized. Document it as a risk, 
produce a business case, and initiate a DR project to fix the gaps.
In addition to what I call DR projects, you have normal business change. Now 
if you’re ever going to close the gaps, you need to prevent, as much as possible, 
new gaps from emerging. The key to this is to embed DR and business con-
tinuity into all of your change projects so that emerging or changing require-
ments are delivered when it’s easiest and most economical to do so. You want 
them to be part of the project that’s changing your business in the first place.
The thing you can’t do is stop the world from changing, so in this sense it is 
both healthy and normal for the requirements to change over time.
Documenting DR Risks
I’m not going to go too deep here with documenting risks because most  
companies already have a framework, templates, and processes to follow.
I will suggest two things that will help you get traction as you try to initiate a DR 
project to address any gaps between risks and your ability to mitigate them.
Try to document the risk and not the threat. Don’t just 
• 
document, for example, that payments don’t have a DR plan. 
Think of the consequence of that, so the consequence or 
risk is that “systemic failure for the U.S. financial system.”
Make sure you have identified the person who is account-
• 
able, and make sure they are in fact held accountable for 
the risk. This person must be empowered to address the 
issue or sign off on the risk.
In effect, what I’m saying is highlight the risk, try to attach it to something that 
is already visible and a cause of focus, and then make sure that those who can 
do something about it are aware and compelled to include fixing the gap in 
their priorities.

Chapter 5 | IT Disaster Recovery
76
Preparing a DR Business Case
Consider the following when you prepare the business case for addressing 
a gap.
Consult your finance department and get direction on exactly what makes 
a winning business case. You really don’t want to keep going backward and 
forward—get it right first time.
Identify any mandatory requirements and make them the focus. For payments 
in Hong Kong, for example, you may have to demonstrate recovery within 
two hours for your payments system as a prerequisite for membership of the 
CHIPS payment system.
Decide what would be an acceptable level of residual risk. In other words, iden-
tify the acceptable level of risk that remains after the project is completed. 
Ensure that you understand the residual risk and make sure this is consistent 
with the risk appetite of your organization.
Assess a range of solutions and select the one that matches the risk appetite. 
Identify the ongoing, running costs of the solution and factor them in.
Don’t wait until you finally and formally submit the business case for it to see 
the light of day. Make sure that all the key people who will be deciding on it 
are aware of what’s in the business case and that they have bought into it. 
Decision day is not the day to be educating people on the finer points of your 
business case. So, the message is get out there, speak to people, and take their 
input on board; then go back to them until you can get them to say “yes.”
Make the decision a “no-brainer” for the person you must persuade. Don’t 
just rest on your laurels. Do a thorough job and speak to finance, getting guid-
ance so you can present your case in the desired format. Last but not least, 
engage all the stakeholders to gather their input and secure their support 
before the case gets submitted for approval.
Undertake a DR Project
Delivering the required DR capability, whether that’s starting from the ground 
up, enhancing an existing solution, or engaging a third party, can be considered 
a project because it has the following:
Defined goal
• 
Starting point
• 
Deliverables
• 
End point
• 

77
Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
Also, regardless of what type of project it is, it will have the following steps:
1.	 Set out the requirements
2.	 Evaluate the possible solutions
3.	 Select the solution
4.	 Detail the design
5.	 Build
6.	 Test
7.	 Implement
8.	 Sign off/close down
The business case should align with these steps, but exactly how you go about 
the project will be driven by your organization's process.
You might not be the project manager, so the key for you is to ask questions 
and make sure the basics are being done.
The following list is a good starter:
Make sure the project is formalized. It needs to be documented, with an agreed 
schedule of work, allocated resources, identified risks and issues, regular prog-
ress reports, clear ownership of the project, and responsibility for managing 
the work.
Make sure the solution will meet your business requirement. If it has to be 
recovered in four hours, for example, how will this be achieved, and what 
reasons do you have to believe this?
Make sure you understand the solution that is being proposed. If you don’t 
understand what’s being proposed, something is seriously wrong because this 
is fundamentally simple stuff. The fault here is not with you but with whoever 
is explaining it to you.
Keep asking the simple questions: what, when, why, how, where, and who. Keep 
at it, and don’t ever feel stupid for asking questions or allow yourself to be 
intimidated. If you ask and still don’t get it, ask again and again and again.
Ask, if people bombard you with noise and technobabble, “So what?” You will 
be surprised how after a few iterations of “Yes, but so what?” you can quickly 
discover that you’re about to pay for a platinum-plated white elephant, when 
you just need a no-frills solution.
Make it your responsibility to sign off the deliverables against the detailed 
design and functional requirements so you can be sure that your requirements 
are being met.

Chapter 5 | IT Disaster Recovery
78
Make sure people know at the outset that you’re going to need to sign off.
Understand why the final solution was chosen, why the others were rejected, 
and what compromises have been made. Think. Will all the requirements be 
met? Has the accountable person been made aware and agreed?
The Change Process
It's highly likely that you will need to improve the culture or process for 
change within your organization. You can’t afford to engage in every change 
to make sure that contingency and resilience requirements are included and 
accurate.
What you need to do is embed business continuity and DR into the change 
process. In particular, you need to make sure that all project managers do this 
without having to remember to do it. If people have to remember business 
continuity and DR, then all is lost.
In other words, you need to include business continuity and DR in things like 
the following:
• 
The project process: This makes business change manage-
ment (BCM) part of every project and something the 
project managers are responsible for.
• 
Project templates: Help people by prompting them as they 
do their projects.
• 
Project checklists: Again, this is an excellent way to remind 
people to include business continuity and disaster 
recovery.
• 
Business objectives: Make people in the business account-
able for their business continuity and set out some 
standard business objectives.
• 
Project sign-off: This should be at every stage of the project 
and not just the end. Make it mandatory. If DR isn’t tested 
and documented, the system can’t go live.

79
Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
Get DR Going Live
Making sure DR works shouldn’t be an issue at this point. With adequate test-
ing, that should be a given.
Rather, the following items are key:
Making sure the DR system is documented.
• 
Making sure that if any business continuity plans are 
• 
affected, they have been updated to reflect the changes.
Making sure that support responsibility for the service, 
• 
and DR in particular, is defined and agreed on.
Making sure that there is adequate funding to cover ongo-
• 
ing testing and maintenance.
Making sure that your new DR solution is tied to the pro-
• 
duction environment it covers. That means if production 
changes, DR must be changed and tested too.
All these points should be covered by the policies that 
• 
cover DR.
Action Plan
Please review these questions and consider how you should respond to any 
recommendations:
1.	 Have you identified a clear set of business requirements 
that list which systems you need recovered, how quickly 
(RTO), and the amount of data loss that would be accept-
able (RPO)? If you have solid requirements, have the busi-
ness owners signed off on them?
2.	 If you have any existing DR solutions, are they able to 
meet business requirements in terms of recovery time 
(RTO) and data loss (RPO)? If not, then you need to 
revisit your business impact analysis process.
3.	 Is DR tested and done regularly enough? If not, then 
review Chapter 8.
4.	 Are the tests meaningful? Do they prove that the DR will 
actually work?
5.	 Are the right people involved in business continuity? Is 
it owned, and are there appropriate policies and con-
trols? If not, then review the section “DR Roles and 
Responsibilities.”

Chapter 5 | IT Disaster Recovery
80
6.	 Are any issues or risks documented? Are the people 
accountable for the exposure aware and responding 
appropriately?
7.	 Is there adequate funding for business continuity, or do 
you need to create a new business case? If not, then 
review the section “Preparing a DR Business Case.”
8.	 Is business continuity an integral element of your change 
process? If not then, review the section “The Change 
Process.”
9.	 Are there strong controls that prevent systems from 
going live without proven DR? If not, then review the 
change and release processes.

Recovery 
Strategies
Identify Your Approach
Business recovery is all about how to keep your critical business processes 
going. This chapter explains the key aspects of business recovery and how you 
can get procedures and policies in place as quickly as possible.
What Does Business Recovery Involve?
At times of disaster, any function will have some sort of business continuity 
requirement. These requirements range from continuing the function regard-
less to suspending the function until the business recovers. Keep in mind that 
doing nothing is a decision; you either decide to do something or time slips 
through your fingers and the decision to do nothing is made for you. So if 
your plan is to do nothing, make sure it’s a conscious decision.
To achieve your desired recovery requirements, you will have to decide on a 
range of strategies that will enable you to achieve the desired state. They can 
be simple, such as setting up simple processes and arrangements, or they can 
be complex, such as building duplicate facilities to which you can shift opera-
tions at the time of crisis.
6
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 6 | Business Recovery Strategies
82
Some of the strategies are achieved by simply documenting them and refer-
encing them in the relevant plans. Others will require extensive funding and 
significant projects to deliver and maintain them.
Regardless of their complexity, your business continuity plans must be changed 
to set out how and when the strategies will be deployed.
Understand Resilient Functions
Functions or activities that must continue uninterrupted are not dealt with 
by business recovery. Or more precisely, resilience is not the same as busi-
ness recovery. If you need resilience—the ability to bounce back quickly if not 
immediately from disasters—then this needs to be built into your systems, 
locations, supply chain, people, and so on.
Resilience typically applies to ultra-critical tasks and is often associated with 
high-risk, zero-tolerance-for-downtime industries such as air traffic control, 
nuclear power generation, and so on.
Of course, this all goes back to your business impact analysis (BIA), where 
you distinguish those things that need resilience from those that can tolerate 
some downtime.
Note
■
■
  Understand the difference between recovery and resilience. In most cases, your job is 
to recover business functions over time (even if that time is short). Resilience, however, is all about 
doing the best you can to keep functions up and running no matter what is going on. As a result,  
it requires much more planning and much more money to deliver.
Understand Recoverable Functions
The majority of activities and functions can tolerate a degree of disruption, 
because they are neither matters of “life and death” nor would they lead to 
the complete failure of your organization.
For these functions, there comes a point in time where work must resume.
However, this resumption is often by degrees. In other words, you don’t simply 
have an interruption and then return straight to business as usual.
Instead the recovery life cycle is more likely something like this:
1.	 You have an outage.
2.	 You experience a period of interruption while recovery 
activities are undertaken.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
83
3.	 You deploy some manual workarounds while services are 
suspended, and you wait for them to be recovered.
4.	 You recover basic services and operate at a reduced level 
of service, focusing on critical activities.
5.	 You clear backlogs and complete recovery of noncritical 
services and resources.
6.	 You return to normal operations.
Figure 6-1 illustrates this life cycle and breaks down the phases.
Employ Manual Workarounds
These are alternatives practices, processes, and procedures that can be 
deployed while systems, suppliers, or other resources are unavailable. These 
are often quite basic activities, such as recording all customer queries on call 
sheets for investigation once systems become available again.
They are not designed to replace the normal processes but just to allow the 
most critical activities to keep going.

Size Your Solution
It’s normal to size recovery solutions with adequate resources to maintain 
critical activities for the duration of an outage. That means you wouldn’t, in 
most cases, size your recovery the same as your business-as-usual operation. 
The reason is simple: cost.
The aim here is survival first, and you are hoping that you’ll never have to 
recover. What you shouldn’t do, however, is gamble on the viability of your 
business. Spend the money you need to ensure a disaster doesn’t put you out 
of business.
In most cases, you should be planning for running a reduced service during any 
business outage. You may have only half the staff able to work consequently, 
so you’ll want to focus on critical activities only. For example, you decide to 
suspend all outbound sales activities and focus totally on servicing existing 
customers.
Business Recovery Options
There are a range of strategies open to you for restoring operations, and they 
are not mutually exclusive. So, they can be mixed and matched as you feel 
appropriate.
The key strategies are as follows:
Work transfer
• 
Displacement of noncritical functions or people
• 
Doubling up
• 
Split site
• 
Offshoring
• 
Work area recovery (WAR)
• 
Mutual aid
• 
Selecting one or more of these options depends in part on your needs and 
budget. However, when you approach this question, don’t think you have to 
pick one or the other.
You can choose a blended approach, where you employ, for example, some 
WAR, displacement, and work transfer. Together, they might make up your 
overall recovery strategy.
Let’s look at each option in more detail.

This strategy is about moving the work, not the people. For example, if  
customer service is critical and done from New York and events conspire 
to close the New York office, you keep operations running by transferring  
customer service to the New Jersey office.
This assumes that the people who normally work in New Jersey will do the 
work. You’re not sending trained people; you’re switching the tasks only.
Using this strategy raises the following issues:
Something will have to give because unless you have  
• 
significant spare capacity at another location, some work 
will not be done.
You will need to cross-train people to make sure they are 
• 
able to do the work.
You will need to monitor skills. It’s not enough just to 
• 
cross-train; you have to make sure that skill sets are 
maintained over time and reflect current needs.
You will need to make technology available to do the 
• 
work; this means access to systems must be provided to 
the workforce at the switch site.
Any unique resources will need to be made available at 
• 
the switch site including materials, stationary access to 
support, suppliers, and so on. 
None of these are insurmountable challenges, of course. You simply need to 
think through them and make the best choice for your situation.
Displacement of Staff
This means sending noncritical staff home so that critical staff can use their 
desks, phones, and so on.
Continuing the previous scenario, we would send noncritical people based in 
the New Jersey office home so that critical staff who normally work in New 
York can work from New Jersey using the desks, PCs, phones, and so on, of 
the displaced New Jersey workers.
This requires tracking and occasionally recategorizing noncritical staff because 
it’s easy for a person or even department that was noncritical last year to be 
indispensable this year.
This strategy is also hard to test because you will need to displace people and 
possibly whole teams to prove it’s viable.

Chapter 6 | Business Recovery Strategies
86
Doubling Up
This is where you use available desks and equipment in shifts. For example, 
one crew works from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., and then another crew comes in to 
work in the same space from 4 p.m. until midnight.
To make this work, you could switch non-time-bound activities such as  
management reporting, research, development, and so forth, to the off-hours. 
For instance, your IT developers could work evenings, while IT support ­people 
work regular office hours when customers need them to be in.
This can leverage the available desks in WAR and significantly reduce your costs.
You can also use the strategy with existing desks at unaffected locations. For 
example, if equity research professionals have been affected by an incident 
that keeps them out of their offices, they could use the equity traders’ desks 
when the markets are closed.
Again, doubling up desks requires that you monitor who is where, and it also 
raises issues around making the necessary technology available for different 
people at the same desk. It probably won’t be practical to build a PC desktop 
for an equity research analyst every night and then rebuild the original desk-
top for the equity trader next morning. In this case, it’s likely that the trader 
will have access to many of the same systems, and the additional reference 
sites may be Internet based.
Split Site
This is a mitigation strategy in which you may decide that something is so 
critical that you will split the workload between two sites—and at all times, 
not just during recovery. In effect, you ensure that all activities are replicated, 
and if one site is unavailable, the remaining site can pick up the corresponding 
workload.
This requires monitoring and strong management because the original drivers 
for a split-site strategy can be forgotten over time. Beware of one-off activities 
that start creeping in at one site and not the other. Also, you might start to 
see skills diminishing.
You also need to factor in that you will probably be able to undertake ­critical 
workload with only one site out. So again, this needs some clear thinking 
about exactly what you are going to do and also what you’re not going to do.
Operating split sites is often the chosen strategy when work is offshored. 
However, while this is viable when work is split between onshore and offshore 
locations, it’s generally the rule that once savings start to be delivered and the 
offshore partner gets experience, then the onshore capacity is reduced or 
goes away altogether.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
87
Offshoring
Where there is offshore capacity, it is possible to switch onshore work offshore 
as long as the skills and access to technology and resources are available.
You have to consider what the impact will be on existing offshore work. 
However, you may find that there is more spare capacity than onshore, and 
they can quickly ramp numbers offshore by adding extra head count and desks 
or employing double seating.
Work Area Recovery
WAR is about providing an alternative workspace to operate critical functions. 
It’s known by various names besides WAR, most notably workplace recovery.
This is normally provided by specialist vendors, and they have two types of 
offering:
Dedicated
• 
Syndicated or shared
• 
Of course, WAR can be provided in-house, and it can be a good way of 
using some spare capacity that you may have in your company’s real estate 
portfolio.
However, if you do it in-house, you need to maintain the site to professional 
standards and ensure that you “ring fence” it from normal business use. 
Otherwise, you will end up with the site being used by business units over 
time, and once they are in, you will find difficult to shift them in a disaster. 
The other thing is that, while you start by just putting in project teams and  
noncritical people into the WAR site, over time these become more settled 
and critical. When you displace them because of a disaster or incident, you 
may find that this has a detrimental effect on your business.
The big advantage of the in-house WAR solution is that you will have access 
to the site 24/7/365 at no cost. You can also share it with all your locations 
at no extra cost.
Yet of course there is a cost to maintaining your own WAR even if a bill 
does not arrive in the mail. Maintaining a building for WAR is very expensive,  
and unless you can find a way to leverage it, the costs will be far higher than 
contracting it to a third party. Plus, you will have maintenance, cleaning, guard-
ing, and more to take care of.

Chapter 6 | Business Recovery Strategies
88
Syndicated WAR Contracts
There are many vendors who will provide space on demand. However, 
­syndicated or shared seats are not sold for your exclusive use. The vendor 
will sell the same seats many times with certain restrictions designed to work 
in your favor.
Typical restrictions include the following:
Geographic exclusion zones. 
• 
The number of times that the seats will be sold. 
• 
The seats can be used only for a disaster that impacts the 
• 
contracted location. 
In other words, they will not sell the same seat to two companies that are 
within the same geographical area (as defined in the contract). They will not 
sell the seats to more than, say, 20 companies, and you can invoke the seat only 
for an event that effects the contracted location.
These restrictions are in place to protect your risk and allow you to judge 
the viability of the recovery solution that you are contracting for. This is not 
obvious at first, but if a company contracts a WAR seat and then internally 
syndicates it for ten buildings, the chances of the seat being in use when you 
need it are significantly higher.
Shared WAR seats also come with greater restrictions when it comes to  
testing. Typically, you are allowed only one test slot per year.
There may also be restrictions on invocation. What happens if someone else 
has already invoked their need for the space? Clearly shared seats come with 
a significant risk because when you come to use them, they may already be 
in use. You won’t be able to invoke the contracted seats. This is why it’s so 
important that you assess these risks and make an informed decision.
Dedicated WAR Contracts
Dedicated seats mean that the vendor dedicates seats for your use only. This 
of course comes at a significant premium over shared seats.
Dedicated seats are necessary where you must guarantee that recovery seats 
will be available, when you need instant or frequent access to the recovery 
facility, or where you have unique technology requirements that need to be 
permanently deployed.
Dedicated seats are common among high-value businesses and critical infra-
structure such as investment banks and utilities. Typically with investment 
banks, the amount of lost income, impact on their reputation, and market 
impact are such that dedicated recovery seats are not optional.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
89
WAR Seat Allocation
Seats are normally allocated in accordance with the sizes of the suites where 
they are. This is commonsense from the vendor’s point of view, on the basis 
that it’s not practical or sometimes technologically viable to invoke two busi-
nesses into the same office space. From a commercial perspective, it wouldn’t 
make sense to sell a few seats from a suite because it would preclude them 
from selling all of them to someone else.
However, for shared seats, exactly how the seats are allocated at the time of 
invocation varies depending on the vendor’s chosen approach.
There are two approaches:
First come, first served
• 
Equitable share
• 
There are rarely negotiable. Once a seat is sold on a given basis, all subsequent 
seats at that site must align with these terms.
Note
■
■
  From time to time, WAR vendors will change their terms and introduce sitewide changes 
for all clients. This normally happens only when two vendors merge and then try to migrate clients 
with different contracts into the site. When this occurs, keep your eyes and ears open for changes 
that affect your plans.
First Come, First Served
This is literally the case: the first business that declares an invocation gets 
all their contracted seats, or at least as many as they need for the given 
scenario.
This highlights a major risk that when you need your WAR seats, they are 
not available. This is a very real risk because companies often find themselves 
needing to invoke their WAR arrangements.
To mitigate this risk, WAR vendors make a number of provisions. You will 
need to weigh these when selecting a vendor.
The main options are as follows:
Use another suite in the same building; this is an option if 
• 
the vendor has more suites and you have subscribed to a 
minority of available seats.

Chapter 6 | Business Recovery Strategies
90
Fall back to another WAR site. Most vendors have mul-
• 
tiple sites and have the capability to deploy your recovery 
positions at a secondary site. This may introduce major 
logistical issues in terms of getting staff to the secondary 
site, but it is better than no site!
Equitable Share
This strategy relies on sharing seats between any businesses that need to 
use the available WAR seats. For example, if there are 200 seats arranged in 
2 suites of 100, and 2 companies invoke that subscribe for 200 seats, they will 
get 100 each.
This raises a number of issues:
What if there’s only one suite? Can you work alongside 
• 
another company?
Can the vendor support concurrent invocations?
• 
What if the invocations are staggered? For example, say 
• 
the first company has already fully invoked their need for 
space and then you invoke it later. Do they have to give 
up some of their positions?
How are amicable agreements going to be reached quickly 
• 
at times of crisis?
When do you draw the line? What if, for example, three 
• 
businesses invoked, or what if the available seats equate 
to less than 50 percent of what is contracted?
Again, all these potential challenges should be considered and thought through 
fully with contingency plans in place if things don’t work out as planned or 
contracted for.
Setting Up Work Area Recovery
In normal operations, it’s not unusual for everyone to have their own unique 
build, with just the applications each person uses.
I’d recommend that for your WAR solution, you adopt a generic build in which 
all the desktops have all the applications. This will simplify both the invocation 
and the ongoing maintenance.
If you have unique builds for every user, you will have to track every change 
and continuously update the builds. If you have generic builds, you need to 
change the build only when an application is introduced or changed.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
91
You may find that licensing costs make this impractical, in which case I rec-
ommend having multiple generic builds, that is, a generic build for each 
department.
WAR INVOCATION RISKS
There are a number of invocation risks that need to be weighed when selecting a WAR 
vendor or indeed when deciding whether to do it in-house. These include the following:
• 
Extended deployment: WAR contracts cover you for a limited 
period that is normally 13 weeks. After this period, the vendor 
can kick you out. However, being business minded what actually 
happens is that your daily invocation fees go through the roof. 
So, this engenders two risks. First, you might lose the recovery 
site after the contracted period. Second, fees might rise to an 
unsustainable level.
• 
Seats are in use when you need them: It’s not unrealistic to 
see that when you come to invoke your space either: someone 
has invoked already because of an earlier event, or someone 
affected by the same event as you has been quicker in invoking 
their contingency plans and consequently already secured the 
available seats.
Technology failure
• 
: This is a high risk because technology 
changes quickly and is complex. It’s quite easily mitigated by 
testing and introducing controls and processes that ensure that 
WAR solutions are maintained in parallel to your live environment. 
For example, if the production desktop builds change, then you 
will need to make sure that the WAR build is changed too—and 
tested before the release goes live.
Mutual Aid: Work with Suppliers and Competitors 
Historically, many crises have been averted by working with competitors, 
other organizations that share suppliers, or the suppliers themselves.
If you are hoping that if it all goes terribly wrong someone else will come and 
bail you out, think again. Everyone will be looking out for themselves and their 
own organizations. However, sometimes cooperation is possible, and there 
may be a few organizations that could benefit from working with other orga-
nizations to get you through a crisis.

Chapter 6 | Business Recovery Strategies
92
Typical examples might be to make spare capacity—be it raw materials, 
machine time, people, infrastructure, or facilities—available to another organi-
zation. For example, both you and a competitor might run your manufacturing 
at 75 percent capacity, so you might want to make some of the spare capacity 
available on a tit-for-tat basis. If you help someone out in a pinch, it’s likely they 
will help you out when it’s your turn to panic.
To make this work, you need to first identify suitable opportunities and then 
formalize the arrangement through a mutual aid agreement that sets out the 
conditions of the relationship.
Create a “Not Doing” List
There is generally too much focus on “what we will do,” and this can often be 
overstated and naive.
So, I urge you to be clear about what you’re not going to do.
Think through some basic scenarios: loss of technology, loss of site, unavail-
ability of staff, denial of access, and loss of a key supplier. Then think through 
what you don’t absolutely have to do, at least in the near term. After all, doing 
nothing, done right and strategically, can save you money without harming the 
business for the long term.
I’d make this formal if possible by getting whoever is accountable for the busi-
ness activity to sign off on a statement that says, for example, that in a disaster, 
activities A, B, and C will be suspended. I’d also make sure that it’s documented 
clearly in your business recovery plan.
This is a critical moderation step because it forces people to think through 
the deeper implications of suspending activities.
Know Your Recovery Solution in Depth
It’s essential that you are clear about your current business recovery solution. 
In particular, you need answers to these questions:
1.	 What strategies will you use?
2.	 If you use WAR, is it dedicated or syndicated?
3.	 If it’s syndicated, what is the syndication ratio, and how 
full is the site at this time?
4.	 If it’s syndicated, is that on a “first come” or “equitable 
share” basis?

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
93
5.	 If it’s “equitable share,” how will this be decided and what 
restrictions exist?
6.	 What’s the minimum number of seats you need to com-
plete your critical obligations?
7.	 What fallback options does the vendor offer, and how 
viable are these for you?
8.	 If there’s only one suite, can you work alongside another 
company?
9.	 Can the vendor support concurrent invocations?
10.	 What if the invocations are staggered, such as if the first 
company has already fully invoked and you invoke later. 
Do they have to give up some of their positions?
11.	 How are amicable agreements going to be reached quickly 
at times of crisis?
12.	 What testing has been done, and did it involve business 
unit users? Have you proven all the critical activities can 
be done at the recovery location?
13.	 How quickly can you resume operation from the recov-
ery location?
14.	 If you have a split-site strategy or are planning to switch 
work, you will have to discontinue some work. What will 
be stopped, and is doing so realistic and? How long can 
you not do something before it becomes a disaster in and 
of itself? 
15.	 Is adequate training undertaken, and is the staff expe-
rienced enough to support a split site or switching 
strategy?
16.	 Is monitoring of skills being undertaken?
17.	 Is access to all the required systems available to the 
workforce at the switch or split site?
18.	 Are there adequate change controls in place to maintain 
all technology in support of the chosen strategy?
19.	 How long is it viable to remain in the recovery location?
20.	 How will the return to normal operations be 
undertaken?

Chapter 6 | Business Recovery Strategies
94
21.	 If a return to normal operations is not possible at 
the original site, can a new or temporary location be 
sourced before you exhaust the capacity of the recovery 
strategy?
22.	 Can all the required resources be made available at 
the switch site, including materials, stationary access to 
­support, suppliers, and so on?
Remediation: Identify Gaps in the Plan
When you review your current situation, you may decide that you have some 
gaps. Maybe you need to extend or strengthen your strategy. Maybe you need 
to replace it.
The answer will require a project to deliver the necessary capability.
Build Business Recovery Solutions
The elements that make up a business recovery project are pretty similar to 
those described in the previous chapter on disaster recovery.
In short, the project must have the following: defined goals, deliverables, and a 
starting point and an end point. Also, regardless of what type of project it is, 
it will have the following steps:
1.	 Set out the requirements.
2.	 Evaluate the possible solutions.
3.	 Select the solution.
4.	 Create a detailed design.
5.	 Build.
6.	 Test.
7.	 Implement.
8.	 Sign off/close down.
The business case should fall within these steps, but exactly how you go about 
the project will be driven by your organization’s process.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
95
In all probability, you will not be the project manager, but you’re not off the 
hook! You need to ask lots of questions to make sure the basics get done.  
A good starter list of ten basics follows:
1.	 Make sure that all the steps in the previous list are 
included.
2.	 Make sure the project is formalized, meaning that it is 
documented, with an agreed-upon schedule of work, 
allocated resources, identified risks and issues, regular 
progress reports, clear ownership of the project, and 
responsibility for managing the work.
3.	 Make sure the solution will meet your business require-
ments. For example, if the business has to be recovered 
in 4 hours, how will this be achieved, and what reasons do 
you have to believe this is possible?
4.	 Make sure you understand the solution that is being pro-
posed. If you don’t understand it, something is probably 
wrong. In general, this is pretty simple stuff—so the fault 
here is not with you for not understanding. However, it 
might be with whoever is explaining it to you.
5.	 Keep asking the simple questions:
a.	
What?
b.	 When?
c.	 Why?
d.	 How?
e.	 Who?  
6.	 Keep at it, and don’t ever feel stupid for asking questions 
or intimidated. If you ask and still don’t understand, ask 
again and again and again.
7.	 Another good question, if people bombard you with 
noise and technobabble, is “So what?” You’d be surprised 
how after a few iterations of “Yes, but so what?” you can 
quickly discover that you’re about to pay for a platinum-
plated doodad when you just need a no-thrills solution.
8.	 Make it your responsibility to sign off on the deliverables 
against the detailed design and functional requirements. 
That way, you can be sure that the requirements are 
being met.

Chapter 6 | Business Recovery Strategies
96
9.	 Make sure people know at the outset that you’re going to 
need to sign off on the deliverables before they can hand 
it over.
10.	 Understand why the final solution was chosen, why the 
others were rejected, and what compromises have been 
made. Will all the requirements be met, and is that accept-
able? Has the accountable person been made aware and 
agreed to this decision?
Prepare a Business Continuity Business Case
Again, you’ll probably need to prepare or at the very least, contribute, to a 
business case. Here are a couple of things I recommend you consider when 
you approach the business case:
• 
Consult finance and get direction on exactly what goes into a 
winning business case. You really don’t want to keep going 
back and forward—get it right first time! 
• 
Identify any mandatory requirements and make these the 
focus. For example, you may be contractually obliged to 
have business continuity for some functions.
D
• 
ecide what constitutes an acceptable level of residual risk. 
In other words, how much risk is acceptable after the 
project? When doing this, you need to make sure this is 
consistent with the risk appetite of your organization.
• 
Assess a range of solutions and select the one that matches 
the risk appetite.
• 
Identify the ongoing running costs of the solution and factor 
these in.
• 
Don’t wait until you submit the business case for it to see 
the light of day. Make sure that all the key people who 
will be deciding on it are aware of what’s in it and have 
bought into it. Obviously, decision day is not the day to 
be educating people on the finer points of your business 
case, so get out there in good time, speak to people, take 
their input on board, and go back to them until you can 
get them to say “yes.” Once you are sure, then you can 
formally submit it for approval!

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity

Tip
■
■
  Make the process of getting your case for business continuity approved a no-brainer. Do 
a thorough job, speak to finance, and get the guidance you need so you present your case in the 
desired format. Last but not least, engage all the stakeholders, gather their input, and secure their 
support before the case gets submitted for approval.
Release Solutions into the “Live” Environment
How you will implement the plan is a critical consideration. Again, just like 
DR, if you don’t manage to transition to live with appropriate rigor, you will 
pay for it later.
Making sure the recovery solution works shouldn’t be an objective. It should 
work because you should have tested it by now.
Instead, the key objectives here are as follows:
Making sure the solution is documented.
• 
Making sure that support responsibility is defined.
• 
Making sure there is adequate funding to cover ongoing 
• 
testing and maintenance work is budgeted.
Making sure that your new solution is directly linked to 
• 
the business it covers. For example, if the business mate-
rially changes, your business continuity solutions must be 
changed and tested too.
Making sure any impacted business continuity plans must 
• 
have been updated. 
All this should be covered by the policies that cover business continuity.
Action Plan
Please take a little time to review these questions and think about the recom-
mendations before moving on:
1.	 Are you clear about which functions need resilience 
as opposed to business recovery? If not, then review 
“Understand Resilient Functions.”
2.	 Have you identified manual workarounds that can be 
deployed to deliver essential activities while the func-
tion is interrupted? If not, review the section on “Employ 
Manual Workarounds” to see whether this is relevant.

Chapter 6 | Business Recovery Strategies
98
3.	 Have you reviewed your business recovery strategy, such 
as WAR, work transfer, and so on? If not, review “Business 
Recovery Options.”
4.	 Have you identified all the activities that you’d suspend 
if you have to operate in recovery mode for a period of 
time? If you have, have you shared this with the affected 
areas and secured formal approval of the corresponding 
“Stop doing” list? If not, pull together a “Stop doing” list 
and get it signed off.
5.	 Have you achieved a comprehensive understanding of your 
existing business recovery capability? If not, review the 
questions you find in the section “Know Your Recovery 
Solution in Depth”
6.	 Do you have enough funding to both support new recov-
ery solutions and maintain your business as usual activi-
ties? If not, then review the section “Prepare a Business 
Continuity Business Case.”
7.	 Do new recovery solutions get properly tested and docu-
mented before going live? If not, then look at your change 
processes and consider some controls or gateways that 
would restrict future solutions being delivered that are 
not proven. If you’re unsure, review the section “Release 
Solutions.”

Supply Chain
Managing Supply Chain Continuity
With so many businesses depending on third parties to provide critical  
services, products, or resources, it’s increasingly important to make sure the 
businesses that support your operations have adequate contingency arrange-
ments. You need to be sure they can continue to deliver your services if they 
experience a disaster. You also need to know whether alternative suppliers 
are available and, if not, how you will cope with a supply chain failure. This 
chapter explores these concerns and sets out some simple actions that will 
expose the risks and make sure you get them covered.
Have a Plan in Place
It’s almost a statement of the blinding obvious, but you need to plan for the 
interruption of the supply of goods and services that third-party organizations 
supply you.
Planning has two aspects. The first aspect is to plan for the failure of supply. 
This, in fact, should be one of your principal planning scenarios. Identify third 
parties that the business depends on, and then identify any workarounds in the 
event the supplier is unable to deliver the needed goods or services. Doing so 
helps you deal with the issue of supply chain risk from the bottom up.
The second aspect is mitigating supplier risk before disaster strikes; this is the 
top-down approach. First, identify which suppliers are critical; then, ensure 
that each one has solid contingency plans and resilience in place to ensure a 
smooth flow of goods and services to you or your customers.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain
100
For most critical suppliers, or where alternative supplies are hard to source, 
you may want to have a strategic plan that deals with a supplier’s failure. This 
may go as far as switching to suppliers with solid risk mitigation plans in place 
or ensuring that you’re not dependent on a single source of supply.
Assessing Third-Party Risk
Before going further, let’s be clear about risk. Just because another company is 
doing something for you, the risk of failure is never transferred to them. Think 
about it—the supplier risks failing to deliver to a client, but you, on the other 
hand, risk losing your whole business.
This is an increasingly important issue as companies continue to outsource or 
offshore noncore activities to third parties.
Note
■
■
  If you depend on suppliers for key inputs, you are the one at risk if any of them fails. That 
should give you more impetus to investigate your suppliers’ DR and business continuity plans before 
putting a lot of trust into their operations.
First, Who Are You Dependent On?
You first need to understand exactly who you depend on and for what. The 
most thorough way to do this is to include a section in your business impact 
analysis that does the following:
Identifies your critical suppliers
• 
Describes the services, products, information, resources, 
• 
and so on, they supply you with
Analyzes the impact on you if the supplier fails
• 
Describes possible internal workarounds 
• 
Identifies alternative suppliers 
• 
Take time into consideration as well. Look at each supplier and ask what the 
impact would be if it is unavailable for 2 hours, 4 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 
1 week, and 1 month. Some, you’ll find, are more critical than others. One  
supplier, for example, may provide 24/7 technical services that you essentially can’t 
do without at any time. Another might make a monthly delivery of noncritical  
items.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
101
Make the Risks Visible
Creating this view will help you rank your suppliers in terms of critical-
ity. Make sure you share this ranking directly with the salient parties, such 
as your steering committee, supply management executives, procurement 
professionals, and so on, and get it ratified before putting it into any formal 
plans or reports.
Big Picture and Focus
Remember, until you investigate, you know only which suppliers have the 
potential to cause you the most pain. You don’t know any facts. You might find, 
for example, that the big exposures are all covered because they are mature 
organizations that have mature business continuity plans of their own. You are 
likely to find, however, that among the middle and lower tier of suppliers you 
might have the greatest risk. Many such firms have little or poor DR and busi-
ness continuity plans.
Either way, you probably have quite a long list with a lot of gaps in terms of 
your knowledge of their actual capability.
I recommend that rather than working through them all, you split up the list 
and focus on the most critical suppliers first. There is going to be a significant 
number of suppliers that fall into the “not critical” category, such as paper 
goods suppliers, landscape gardeners, and so on. Make sure these are identi-
fied so you can focus only on the critical suppliers.
Tackle the remaining list of suppliers in two phases. First, ask very high-level 
questions by sending out a simple questionnaire that helps you identify some 
basic facts and gives a sense of their capabilities.
The survey would ask high-level questions such as the following:
Do you have a business continuity plan that covers the 
• 
delivery of our service?
Have you tested it?
• 
Do you have DR plans for IT systems that are required to 
• 
deliver our service?
Have you tested the DR plan for these systems in the last 
• 
12 months?
If you had an outage that affected the delivery of our  
• 
service, how quickly would the service be restored?

Chapter 7 | Supply Chain
102
Having gathered more detail about your supply chain, next undertake a  
second phase where you can do a deeper dive—called an individual assessment—
on the suppliers that are clearly most critical or represent the greatest risk.
In subsequent phases, you can expand the number of suppliers that you  
subject to a deep dive.
Individual Supplier Assessments
In these assessments, you need to expand the high-level questions to cover 
broader issues of governance and quality and then ask for evidence. So, for 
example, you will want to know about the following:
Their BCM policy
• 
Accountability
• 
Crisis and incident management policies
• 
Testing schedules
• 
Access to test results
• 
Remediation of Risks
You may unearth some significant issues where your suppliers don’t have ade-
quate continuity. In these cases, you’ll need to document the issue, agree on 
an action, make sure it’s owned, and monitor progress.
Business Continuity and Contracts
There’s a good chance that up until now you have not adequately covered 
business continuity in your third-party contracts. For this reason, make sure 
that all new contracts include business continuity going forward.
This should not just be about the next contract. It’s far better to look at the 
overall contract process and make sure you make changes to the contract 
process itself so that all future contracts consider business continuity.
On one level, this needs to be covered by standard terms and condi-
tions. However, every supplier relationship is unique and has its own risks. 
Consequently, it’s important that not only do you have suitable wording, but 
that you have personally been engaged in the process to review the assess-
ment of the risks and how it is planned to be managed or mitigated to be sure 
that you’re not just signing up to words or something that doesn’t actually 
meet your needs.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
103
The backbone of any contract has to be a clear definition of the levels of 
service and availability that you expect from the supplier and the maximum 
disruption time that is acceptable. This is fine when it’s a new service that you 
are procuring, but where there are existing relationships in place, what do you 
do? In simple terms, make sure that when each contract comes to a contract 
break or for renewal, you review the contracts and supplier both to make 
sure that business continuity is adequately covered.
Tip
■
■
  Write into all contracts with suppliers that they must have business continuity plans in place. 
Be specific about service levels required and maximum disruption times. And don’t trust their word 
that they have contingency plans. Ask for evidence.
Action Plan
Before moving on, reflect on the following questions and the corresponding 
recommendations:
1.	 Does your existing business continuity planning cover 
supplier failure? If not, then review all plans with this sce-
nario in mind and suitable workarounds made. Where 
there is not suitable alternatives to supplier failure, assess 
the risk and take steps to raise the gap with crisis manag-
ers and mitigate the risk.
2.	 Have you identified all of your critical suppliers? If not, pull 
together a list of all suppliers and rank them by criticality.
3.	 Do you know if each supplier meets your business 
requirements? If not, find out by conducting supplier sur-
veys to establish if they have adequate plans, if plans have 
been successfully tested, and so on.
4.	 Have you recorded all your risks and issues, have they 
been suitably escalated, and do you have appropriate 
actions plans agreed and underway?
5.	 Have you included business continuity in your new con-
tract process?
6.	 Is anyone with business continuity experience engaged in 
the new contract process to review requirements, con-
tracts, and supplier capability?
7.	 Make sure that as contracts come up for renewal or a 
contract break, business continuity is reviewed and con-
tracts changed to reflect your new requirements.

Continuity 
Suppliers
Select and Manage Business Continuity  
Service Providers
If you rely on third parties to deliver business continuity or disaster recovery 
(DR), this chapter explains how to select the right partner and make sure that 
what they deliver matches what you need.
Selecting Business Continuity Suppliers
Choosing the right supplier is important because in a sense you are betting 
your business on them. It’s also important because you will be locked into a 
relationship with them for the next 5 years or so.
The services in question fall into the following broad categories: business 
recovery (work area recovery [WAR]), technology recovery (IT DR), consul-
tancy, and tools. There are suppliers that specialize in a small niche like crisis 
management or telephony recovery, and there are others that provide all the 
services and products.
Note
■
■
  Historically, large organizations conducted recovery activities in-house, but over time 
specialist organizations have sprung up, and their offerings have matured to the point where they are 
better than what can be offered in-house. Plus, they can be delivered quicker and at a lower cost.

Start with Your Needs
It can be a big mistake to start talking to suppliers before you have quantified 
your needs.
In the case of WAR, you should know the following:
Locations that need to be covered
• 
Recovery times
• 
Approximate numbers of seats
• 
Technology, including desktops, servers, network connectivity
• 
Telephony, including voice recording, headsets, number of 
• 
DDIs, fax, IVR, and so on
In the case of IT DR, you should know the following:
Hardware
• 
Backups
• 
Networks including firewalls and routers
• 
Recovery time objectives
• 
Recovery point objectives
• 
In the case of both WAR and IT DR you should also think about basic 
needs, such as security for the site, cleaning, refreshments, meeting rooms, 
and so on.
In the case of consultancy, you should know the following:
What is the problem?
• 
When does it need to be solved by?
• 
How much is it costing you now?
• 
What must any consultancy engagement deliver?
• 
In the case of tools, you should know the following:
Target user group
• 
How many users
• 
Deployment restrictions such as hosting, platforms,  
• 
cross-border data, and so on
I use this information to create a request for tender document that I pass to 
a short list of potential suppliers. (You should use whatever is the standard 
procurement documents and process mandated by your organization.)

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
107
Tip
■
■
  To find business continuity and DR service suppliers, simply search on Google for the 
keywords that interest you, such as business continuity software. However, I use this to just do some 
background research to get a feel for products and features. Then I take my time to go and talk to 
people who already use these services. The best place to start is your industry interest groups. You 
may find that someone has already undertaken a study, but people are always happy to tell you about 
their good and bad experiences.
Create on Objective View
Next, create a “vendor assessment” spreadsheet with all your requirements 
on it. Distinguish between mandatory requirements and those that are merely 
important. Apply a weighting to each requirement so that you can come up 
with an objective score for each supplier.
Make appointments to meet with providers and get answers and data to fill in 
your spreadsheet. I manage engagements with suppliers so that each gets the 
same opportunity to impress me. I normally have an initial meeting at my site 
to discuss the requirements, and then I give them an opportunity to gather 
more information that will help with their proposal. Next, I undertake site 
visits, making sure I visit all the proposed locations. At the end of each visit, I 
complete a vendor assessment.
I also like to work with at least two other key stakeholders on this, normally 
IT networking people, along with business representatives. I find they will 
have a different perspective on many aspects of the vendor and the proposed 
solutions. This generally proves fruitful, and I normally find things I’d other-
wise miss.
Tip
■
■
  Bring IT and department managers along with you on site visits. They will have insights 
about what’s needed and spot things you might otherwise miss.
Finally, it’s down to the assessments. Sometimes, you can use this to whittle 
down the numbers of prospective vendors before undertaking a final round of 
selection. Even better, you might be able to make a choice at this point.
If I find that I or one of the other stakeholders is disagreeing with the choice, 
I always take some time out to review the issues. Spreadsheets are good but 
never perfect, and it could be that your criteria are wrong or you have missed 
something that turns out to be more important. It could also be something 
totally intangible, such as you don’t like the supplier! Whatever the objection 
is, get to the bottom of it!

Chapter 8 | Continuity Suppliers
108
Contracts
Contracts are normally drafted by the supplier, but it’s normally an iterative 
process where, based on the basic requirements, they will offer a draft con-
tract for you to review. You will normally engage all the key stakeholders in 
your organization to go through the contract line by line with your lawyers 
to make sure you understand the contract and it aligns with the requirements 
and your internal standards. I normally have a behind-closed-doors review 
within the organization. Then, once we are clear about what issues or ques-
tions we have, we normally repeat it with the supplier and their legal team. 
This normally takes a couple of iterations and can be quite painful because the 
detail can be quite obtuse and dull. However, you should never treat this step 
lightly because you’re committing your organization to a long-term relation-
ship and financial liability.
First and foremost, before contracts are drafted, you need a clear definition 
of the following:
The service
• 
How it will be measured
• 
What the penalties will be if the supplier fails to meet the 
• 
agreed level of service
If you and the supplier are not clear on these points, you will be fighting an 
uphill battle when it comes to managing the service.
That means you should be actively involved in the contract negotiations.
If contract negotiations have already been completed and the contract is 
already in place, plan how you can get it sorted out. Find out when the next 
service review meeting is and make sure you get this tabled through whoever 
owns the relationship with the supplier.
You’ll almost certainly hit a wall, in which case keep pushing, but also look to 
the next break clause in the contract or when it’s due for renewal.
Either way, get the issue documented and owned and keep a focus on it, even 
if you aren’t the one who will own it or ultimately resolve it!
Contract Breakpoints
Make sure you have breakpoints included in any contracts, and be aware of 
when they are coming so that you can table any changes in good time.
It sounds cynical, but you will find suppliers more flexible when there is an 
immediate threat to their ongoing income!

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
109
Contract Termination
Be mindful of the end of contracts for two reasons.
First, you need to allow yourself plenty of time to get the best possible deal 
with a new supplier. This means some planning, requirements gathering, testing 
the market, and a formal supplier selection process.
Second, if you have multiple contracts in place with different vendors, you 
should aim to co-terminate them and negotiate a single-supplier deal. It will 
make your negotiations more effective, because you’ll have more leverage and 
should be able to get a better commercial deal. There’s also significant reduc-
tion in overhead cost for you if you have to manage only one relationship. 
Overall, your operations are improved because each vendor will have a unique 
process for everything and idiosyncrasies within the service offering. It’s often 
worth waiting longer so that you can get out of all your existing relationships. 
You’ll get a better deal benefit over the long term from reduced cost and a 
simplified process.
KPI and Service Credits
Take time to understand the essentials that the continuity service provider 
must offer.
Think about this from the following points of view:
Operational 
• 
Customer
• 
Financial
• 
Legal
• 
Regulatory
• 
Employee
• 
These generally relate to the same features or elements of the service but 
from a different point of view. Typically, this would include the technology 
and infrastructure such as data and telephony, as well as facilities and related 
services such as security, cleaning, and catering. There are also requirements 
around the facilities offering covering things such as size of suites, ability to 
segregate some teams, provision of meeting rooms, teleconference rooms, 
post rooms, and so on. Each of the previous may have a different view of each 
aspect of the service.
For example, if we think about suite size, operational requirements might be 
met by a large suite because it’s easy for people to interact with all the people 
they work with. From a financial point of view, it might be good because it 

Chapter 8 | Continuity Suppliers
110
keeps costs down, but from a regulatory point of view it doesn’t allow you 
to segregate some activities from the rest. And from an employee point of 
view, a large suite is not ideal; it’s too noisy and busy, which makes it harder 
to work.
Try to formulate these requirements in measurable terms. These measure-
ments will become your key performance indicators (KPIs) that tell you 
that everything is good and, if not, where you need to direct management 
attention.
For example, “Telephony will be available on all desktops within 1 hour of invo-
cation, and fully imaged and working desktops will be available within 2 hours.” 
Such requirements may already be documented as part of the original request 
for tender or whatever documents your organization uses.
Once you have identified the KPIs for each area, look beyond the essentials 
to the merely important and analyze them from the perspectives mentioned 
earlier.
Some of the requirements are obvious and relate to the immediate delivery of 
the critical services. Others are more mundane, but things such as having the 
soda machines cleaned and replenished become significant when you have to 
spend weeks at a recovery site.
Within your organization, you may have specialists who are dedicated to set-
ting up and managing such agreements, but you still need to be aware of prog-
ress and drive it when necessary.
The specialists in third-party contracts and management probably won’t be 
able to set the requirements, but they can help you pull them together and 
document them so that they can become part of the contract.
One area where they will be essential is in creating service credits. This is 
where you formulate the consequences of a failure to meet the KPIs. The 
penalty is normally financial, and it will be deducted from future payments. In 
practice, this may be more than offset by additional work that you will need 
from the supplier that’s outside of the contract, such as extra test days, 
additional racking, and so on.
Service Reviews
You need to meet with the supplier about once a quarter, though an annual 
meeting might be good enough. You should review agreements in light of orga-
nizational changes and the volume of work you continue to do using the 
supplier.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
111
Have a standard agenda along the following lines:
Review previous minutes
• 
KPIs/service credits
• 
Issues
• 
Next test
• 
Planned work
• 
Any other business 
• 
Tests and Test Reviews
If you use third-party suppliers, then it’s essential that when you test, you 
fully engage them in the design of the test and resolution of any issues. These 
should not be limited to just the technical aspects of the service; you should 
also measure the customer experience of using the service and feed that 
back, too.
After the test, you should include a review of the suppliers’ performance.
Formalize the review by including supplier KPIs in the test and producing a 
test report that gets sent to the supplier. Then review the results with the 
supplier and agree on improvements needed.
Few companies do this, but it’s a great opportunity to build a better relation-
ship with your supplier as you’re giving them valuable feedback and working 
with them to improve the service.
This is quite shocking. Just recently, I was talking to the managing director of 
the United Kingdom’s largest business continuity firm, and he said that only 
40 percent of his clients tested their service. He’s totally committed to testing 
because he knows it’s the best way to get the service right and to be sure it 
will work at a time of crisis.
Demand Good Service
It’s important to remember that you are the customer and you deserve the 
best service possible. If you feel you’re not getting a good service, challenge 
the supplier.
It’s really important you have a good relationship with the supplier; it makes 
for a better service and a better life. The key to this is the quality of the per-
son who looks after your account. I’ve made the mistake in the past of judging 
the supplier by the account manager. This can be a costly mistake because 

Chapter 8 | Continuity Suppliers
112
you can become so disillusioned that you jump ship to a new supplier, which 
comes at quite a cost for changing and may not offer a better service. Really, it 
wasn’t the supplier that needed to change; it was the account manager.
Tip
■
■
  If you find that you’re unhappy with the service that your account manager for the continuity 
service is giving you or you don’t have a good relationship, demand a new account manager.
This improves matters on a few different levels. First, it removes an issue of 
concern; second, it keeps the next account manager on his toes; and third, it’s 
good for the supplier if you get an account manager who is doing a great job 
as opposed to someone who is causing delays and irritating you, the client.
The difference between account managers is massive. I’ve had account manag-
ers who couldn’t get anything done, failed to complete actions, and irritated 
my staff and their own. I’ve seen these “failures” replaced with people who 
could do wonders and made me feel that they were working for me as much 
if not more than for their own company.
Keep Suppliers Keen
You want to build a good and positive relationship with the supplier, and you 
should have a frank and fruitful working relationship with your account man-
ager. But remember, you’re not in this to be popular; you’re doing it to look 
after your company’s best interests.
The good news is that the best interests of both companies often overlap, but 
the bad news is that some suppliers or their salespeople will put their inter-
ests before yours so they get the maximum reward and you get the minimum 
service.
Yet don’t be anything other than positive, have high expectations, and know 
the market, all so you can assess that you are getting a fair deal. If it’s a fair 
deal, the supplier will make a reasonable margin, and you get good value and 
an offering that meets your needs. The best way to “know the market” is to 
have a dialogue with competitors and your peers. Try to access benchmarks 
for your industry or the service you are buying in.
If you’re not getting a good deal, let the supplier know. Talking to other sup-
pliers keeps them on their toes too, and when you come to renew, make sure 
you get competitive quotes.
The surest way to secure a great service with fair commercial terms is through 
your account manager. Remember, you are the customer. Be fair but clear, and 
if the account manager doesn’t measure up, you know what to do!

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity

Tip
■
■
  Get competitive quotes for third-party continuity services whenever a contract comes up for 
renewal. Even if you’re happy, it’ll keep your current supplier on its toes.
Action Plan
Have a look at the following questions and reflect on the resulting 
recommendations:
1.	 Do you have a clear set of business recovery require-
ments? If not, then you’ll need to go back to the BIA and 
document RTOs and RPOs for every component that 
requires recovery. You will have to also capture techni-
cal requirements such as number of CPUs, amount of 
memory, and so on.
2.	 Do you have a clear set of business provider require-
ments? This covers the practical aspects of third-party 
solution: how far a recovery site can be from your office, 
how many tests a year you want to undertake, whether 
you need them to provide security, cleaning, and catering, 
and so on. When you set these out, make it clear, for you 
at least, whether requirements are mandatory, important, 
or nice to have, because this will make the scoring much 
easier when it comes to selection.
3.	 When selecting, do you assess prospective vendors con-
sistently? Is this process easily audited? If not, then where 
is the inconsistency? Consider documenting a formal 
acquisition process and using scored assessments that 
can be used to compare and contrast different vendors.
4.	 Do you have standard terms and conditions that can be 
used? Do your contracts document all the elements of 
the service that you are contracting for? Are any addi-
tional costs or responsibilities clear? If not, get some pro-
fessional help to review your contract.
5.	 Do you have KPIs in place with pre-agreed service cred-
its if these KPIs are breached? If not, then I recommend 
investigating this approach and get some specialist advice 
on including them in your contract.
6.	 Do you perform regular service reviews with your suppli-
ers? If not, then I recommend that you introduce them.

Chapter 8 | Continuity Suppliers
114
7.	 Do you review the supplier’s performance following every 
test? If not, then I recommend making this a formal part 
of your test life cycle and provide them with a report 
where they sign off on the agreed actions.
8.	 Are you aware of the contract breakpoints and termina-
tion dates? If not, then find out when these breaks are, 
and start to think about how you should approach future 
commercial negotiations. Get advice from your organiza-
tion’s procurement or vendor management specialists if 
you have them. 
9.	 Do you have a good commercial relationship with the 
supplier? Does your account manager seem to get things 
done for you, come back quickly, and so on? If not, then 
remember you are the customer and ask for a new 
account manager. If you find that the service is consis-
tently bad, then factor this into the next round of nego-
tiations. In other words, do you want to do business with 
a supplier that can’t do the basics right?

Education and 
Awareness
How to Educate the Workforce
Having people who understand their responsibilities and are well versed in 
how to undertake them in a variety of stressful situations is essential if an 
organization is to survive a disaster or any other major out-of-the-ordinary 
event that upsets operations. This chapter will help you understand your 
education needs and deliver a program that prepares all key staff for poten-
tial disasters.
The Point of Education
Plans are important, but in reality, they are not essential. What’s essential is 
having a capability that enables you to recover or able to improvise a recovery 
within the critical time frame. If you can’t recover, then it’s a distinct possibility 
that you will not have an organization after disaster strikes.
Similarly, having a technical recovery capability is only half the story. If you 
don’t have people who can invoke the recovery and people who can adapt 
quickly as events change, then your recovery capability is useless.
Education and awareness are principally concerned with making sure people 
are prepared for the likely eventualities.
It will tell them what to do if they have a role to play. If they don’t have a role, it 
will tell them what will happen to them, where they can get information during 
a disaster, and what they should do if any part of the organization is crippled.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 9 | Education and Awareness
116
Ideally, education and awareness should also root out any people who have 
been given roles they aren’t suited to. This is never easy because most people 
refuse to accept their weaknesses and are even worse at pointing out weak-
ness in others, especially if the person in question is someone in power.
Note
■
■
  Education and awareness, when it comes to business continuity, are all about preparing 
people for their roles in a disaster to ensure operations are affected as little as possible.
Before going further, let’s be clear:
Education addresses people’s need to attain skills and knowledge to perform 
specific recovery roles. It also affords them an opportunity to practice in a 
safe environment where they can make mistakes—and learn from them—
without pressure.
Awareness is about raising everyone’s awareness about business continuity. It’s 
about making sure everyone in the organization knows what to expect, what 
they will need to do, and where they will need to be if a disaster arises.
Education and Awareness Program
Education and awareness activities are often grouped together in a single 
ongoing program of work.
Awareness Events
Awareness events are normally scheduled to take place throughout the year. 
There are many low-cost options for getting the word out. These include the 
following:
• 
Team briefings and formal presentations: You can join team 
meetings throughout the organization to give informal pre-
sentations. You can also stand up and deliver full, formal pre-
sentations at official town hall–type events. You may want to 
do these yourself, or you can provide the individual business 
continuity coordinators with a slide deck. If you delegate 
this, I recommend doing a “train the trainer” session first 
and attend as many as you can to judge quality and make 
improvements to future training sessions or materials.
• 
Market stand: From time to time there will be events that 
take place in your organization where you will have an 
opportunity to set up a stand and promote BCM.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
117
• 
Desk drops: In a “desk drop,” you leave fliers on all staff 
desks. Fliers typically cover things such as evacuation pro-
cedures, muster points, contact information, what to do 
in an event, and so on.
• 
E-mails: Here you might send out a pack of documents 
via e-mail. It’s similar to the desk drop, but you rely on 
people opening attachments, printing out instructions, 
and so on.
• 
Screen savers: You can sometimes get a slide included for a 
while as the screen saver on all the company PCs.
• 
Internal publications: You might be able to include an arti-
cle in an internal publication or newsletter. You’ll often 
find that many areas have such publications, including HR, 
information security, IT, quality, and so on. They are often 
looking for suitable content to fill their newsletters and 
so will welcome your interest.
• 
Quiz or competitions: Don’t laugh. One company I worked 
for struggled to get the business continuity message 
out, especially to junior administration staff. Then they 
did a competition with a Nintendo Wii (when it was a 
really hot commodity) as the prize. They asked people 
to read an article and answer some questions. They 
kept all the responses as evidence that they’d gotten the 
message out—and they nearly sank under the volume 
of responses. That was achieved for less than $250 as 
opposed to the thousands of dollars in man hours spent 
on less-fruitful tactics. The result was that within days,  
just about everyone in the head office had read and could 
repeat the information they needed to know about business 
continuity.
Tip
■
■
  Consider a quiz or competition of some sort to promote awareness of business continuity. 
All entries go into a drawing for something your people will find of value. You’ll get a much better 
response than you expect.

Chapter 9 | Education and Awareness
118
Education Activity
Education tends to works best when it’s responsive to specific needs. Generally 
as soon as someone assumes a new responsibility, they should be trained in 
the basics.
For example, when someone has been made the business continuity coordi-
nator for the IT department, there is a very specific set of things they need to 
know about. Some of these things will be generic and common to all depart-
ments, such as what a business impact analysis (BIA) is, why we do it and how, 
and when to complete the BIA. Other things will be unique to their role. For 
example, IT may have two discreet challenges: first, to recover the technol-
ogy in a disaster, and then, in addition to the recovery support they have to 
provide, they need to plan for the continuity of their business. Thus, they will 
have to continue to support all the critical services, mandatory change, and 
anything else identified as critical by the BIA. This focused approach to educa-
tion where it’s more tailored works well because people can see what’s in it 
for them and it relates to their actual responsibilities.
Someone assuming new responsibilities for business continuity is a trigger 
event, and it needs to be the business’s responsibility to organize training.
Also, when you have any new joiners, they should have a basic overview of 
business continuity that covers what it is, how it is managed, what to do if an 
event happens, and how to find out more information at times of crisis using 
things like a staff hotline, Internet page, or contact details.
The business continuity coordinator should brief all new joiners on the details 
of their business continuity plan and their role, if any, and provide details of the 
recovery site and how to get there.
It’s advisable to have a rolling schedule of training events, such as annual train-
ing for business recovery coordinators. This can be timed to precede the 
annual DR test, or, if you have sufficient demand, you can have these repeated 
through the year. That way, as new coordinators are appointed, they can go on 
the next training event.
You should aim to get face to face with all key people—members of your crisis 
management team, for example—annually. Use this meeting as an opportunity 
to review the roles and responsibilities of each person. While you’re doing this, 
you can focus on any areas they or you may feel is weak. If necessary, you can 
arrange a supplementary session to focus educating people in key positions 
who need extra help.

What Are Your Needs?
When I set up an ongoing education and awareness program, I always start by 
undertaking a survey of the educational needs of the organization. I start by 
preparing a basic questionnaire that covers the key areas of knowledge and 
do some sample surveys.
Typical questions include the following:
Do you know whether you have any responsibilities in 
• 
the event of a disaster?
Do you know who your business continuity coordinator is?
• 
Do you know what the plan is for recovering your  
• 
department in a disaster?
Do you know how to find out information in a disaster?
• 
Do you know where your business recovery site is and 
• 
how to get there?
Do you know whether you have been allocated a seat at 
• 
the recovery site?
Have you ever been to the business recovery site?
• 
You have to tailor the questionnaire to reflect your organization and the 
strategies you use. For example, if you don’t have a recovery site but instead 
shift work to other locations, then this should be reflected in the questions.
You might also have some additional surveys for specialist areas such as IT, 
BCM specialists, and crisis management team members.
Here are the typical questions for a recovery coordinator:
Do you know what you have to do in the event of a 
• 
disaster?
Do you know who your business continuity manager is?
• 
Are you comfortable with the BIA process? If not, what 
• 
are you unsure about?
Do you know when the BIA and business continuity plan 
• 
(BCP) needs to be updated?
Are you familiar with all sections of the BCP? If not, what 
• 
are you unsure about?
Do you know how to do desktop walk-throughs with 
• 
your recovery team?

Do you know what you have to tell a new joiner about

business continuity?
Do you know how to get changes to the BIA and business 
• 
recovery plan (BRP) approved by your management?
Do you know what you need to do to prepare for a con-

attendees?
Do you know what to do during a test, such as monitor-
• 
ing the correct completion of test scripts, gathering the 
completed test scripts before people leave, and escalating 
issues through the agreed-upon process?
Do you know what you have to do after a test, such as 
• 
logging any issues and making sure that they are appro-
priately escalated to management, reviewing the lessons 
learned, and making improvements to the BRP and any 
related materials?
Here are the typical questions for a crisis team member:

Do you understand how business continuity integrates 
• 
into your change management process?
Do you know how to make changes to the recovery 
• 
scripts and what the change controls are around such 
changes?
Do you have the right skills to undertake your recovery 
• 
tasks?
Do you know what to do during a test, such as how and 
• 
where to record timings, who to notify on completion of 
tasks, escalating issues through the agreed-upon process, 
and so on?
Do you know what you have to do after a test, such as 
• 
logging any issues and making sure that they are appro-
priately escalated to management, reviewing the lessons 
learned, and making improvements to the test script, 
recovery process, tools, and staff training?
Then, using the responses, focus the program to address the areas of greatest 
need. I apply a little common sense to focus first on those areas that are both 
gaps and represent the biggest risk. I also weigh the amount of effort involved 
as well so that I can make the maximum impact on education and awareness 
as quickly as possible.
Measuring Education and Awareness
I’m no genius and I definitely don’t have divine insight, so I can’t be sure that I 
know exactly what works and what doesn’t. That’s not a problem for me, and 
it shouldn’t be for you. Don’t be too hard on yourself. As a principle, I always 
expect some things not to work. That’s life, and your job is to spot them and 
sort them out!
So, with my ego intact, even though I assume that I’m probably making some 
mistakes, I test everything that I think matters. In particular, I test whether the 
training and awareness events are having any impact.
This is generally as simple as repeating a sample of the earlier education sur-
vey questionnaire after the training and comparing the scores.
If the survey shows that you have not made the impact you may have hoped 
for, don’t get hung up. Try to understand what you could do differently. It could 
be that the people being trained are very hands on, and giving them lots of 
things to read didn’t work for them, so you need to make the training more 
experiential. If there are specific issues that can be tackled as a “one-off” 
training and are worth doing, do it. If not, include it in your plan for next year.  

Chapter 9 | Education and Awareness
122
It doesn’t mean that you’re no good. In fact, it means that now you’re bet-
ter than you were because you know something—you know what doesn’t 
work, and that is priceless! In essence, you’ve gone from being unconsciously 
incompetent to consciously incompetent, which is a step many people never 
manage.
Tip
■
■
  Don’t assume people have been “educated.” To ensure they have absorbed the message 
you want them to, test their knowledge before and after training. If you still see knowledge gaps, don’t 
kick yourself; train some more.
Action Plan
Before moving on, reflect on the following questions and the corresponding 
recommendations:
1.	 Have you identified your education and awareness needs? 
If not, then I recommend doing a survey of what you need 
and formalizing the requirements.
2.	 Do you have a planned set of activities to deliver educa-
tion and raise awareness? If not, then prepare a plan of 
what you’re going to do, when, and with whom.
3.	 Do you keep records of what training and awareness has 
been delivered? If not, then start keeping records that 
will enable you to manage an effective and comprehen-
sive ongoing education and awareness program.
4.	 Do you go back regularly and review how effective your 
education and awareness is? If not, then regularly assess 
the current state and have some KPIs that will tell you 
how you’re doing and whether you need to take remedial 
action.

Essentials for Business Continuity
This chapter presents what is essential when it comes to business continuity: 
making sure things are done to agreed-upon standards, understanding what 
challenges you might have with your practices, and knowing what routine tasks 
are required. This chapter covers policy, processes, the key reports, and how 
you can have all these without creating a bureaucracy that slows response 
time to disasters and other negative events.
Create a Policy
First, create a policy on business continuity. This should of course be consis-
tent with your organization’s standards for policies. However, the thing that is 
universal is the need to set out, at a high level, what it is that business continu-
ity exists to achieve and who is responsible for the key aspects of it.
Note
■
■
  Two appendices in this book will be very helpful in crafting business continuity policies and 
governance structures: Appendix D: Resources and Contacts and Appendix J: Business Continuity 
Management Standards. In addition, you will find numerous policies relating to business continuity 
just by doing a simple Web search on the topic.

C H A P T E R 

Chapter 10 | Governance and Reporting 
124
You could split your policy into a policy document and a set of standards or 
you could have a set of policies covering the range of disciplines that make 
up business continuity management, such as business continuity planning, IT 
service continuity, and crisis management.
In simple terms, any policy should contain:
A set of objectives
• 
A statement of accountability
• 
A set of responsibilities
• 
These should be described at a high level, but must be clear enough for you 
to manage business continuity across your organization.
Set Standards and Create Processes
Once you have a policy in place, you need to implement it. To do that, you 
should have something equivalent to a set of standards or a good practice 
guide that sets out specifically how you will undertake the objectives identi-
fied by the policy. You will also benefit from describing the lifecycle of business 
continuity activities and how these relate to one another.
Finally, you will need a program of work that is completed on an ongoing basis. 
This program makes sure the key activities that make up the process are com-
pleted regularly and to a consistent level of quality.
You can think of it as a hierarchy, as shown in Figure 10-1.

Tip
■
■
  Don’t put the cart before the horse. First, set policy. Then, create standards. Last, put 
events in motion and controls in place to ensure you can maintain business continuity in the face of  
a disaster.
Assign Steering and Management 
Accountability
The policy should define management accountability; ideally this will be dele-
gated to an individual or individuals rather than, say, the “crisis team,” because 
it’s much easier to get traction when one person is held accountable.
This shouldn’t be a passive role. The accountable manager or managers should 
be actively involved in strategic planning, aware of issues, and signing off on any 
new risks or changes.
A steering team meeting is a good idea. Normally, this will convene quarterly, 
and it should have a consistent agenda and be formally recorded.
A typical agenda would be:
Strategy
• 
Progress against plans
• 
Issues
• 
Risks
• 
Update by location, business line, product, or asset class 
• 
(use whichever is most relevant for you)
IT disaster recovery update
• 
Work area recovery (WAR) update
• 
Assess Maturity Annually
Some of the key responsibilities of the steering committee are to set the 
long-term strategy and to ratify the plans that will both deliver the strategy 
and deliver business-as-usual business continuity activities (assessments, walk-
throughs, etc.).
Before you set out on any journey, you need to know where you are now. 
Furthermore, as you make progress with your plans, you need to keep check-
ing the map to make sure you are on the right path.

Chapter 10 | Governance and Reporting 
126
A maturity assessment is a useful tool to achieve both of these tasks. These 
assessments don’t need to be nearly as complex as they sound. You just need 
to identify some key controls for business continuity and then define some 
measures for each control. Finally, decide how each measure can be repre-
sented in terms of process maturity.
To illustrate this, take a single aspect of business continuity such as business 
impact analysis. A control might be something like “Every business unit has 
completed a business impact analysis within the past 12 months.”
The following maturity model is recommended for self-assessment. You 
should be able to determine the level of adherence to the control objective 
either as self-assessment or independent review.
The scale used for the maturity model ranks from 0 to 5:
0: Nonexistent. Management processes are not applied 
at all.
1: Initial. Processes are ad hoc and disorganized.
2: Repeatable. Processes follow a regular pattern.
3: Defined. Processes are documented and 
communicated.
4: Managed. Processes are monitored and measured.
5: Optimized. Best practices are followed and 
automated.
The maturity model is used by conducting the following mappings and 
comparisons:
The current status of the organization: where the orga-
• 
nization is today.
The current status of the industry (best in class in): the 
• 
comparison.
The organization’s strategy for improvement: where the 
• 
organization wants to be.
How many controls you have is up to you. These may already exist for your 
organization if, for example, you already have a control framework like COBIT 
(see Appendix J) in place.
Once you have assessed the controls, you can make some fundamental deci-
sions about the level of maturity you want to achieve. You might not need 
to be fully mature in all the controls. Some may be mandatory and require 

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
127
immediate attention; the great thing about doing the maturity assessment is 
that you can start to make some informed decisions about where you’ll focus 
attention.
You will also have a powerful tool when it comes to dealing with internal and 
external auditors.
Note
■
■
  You don’t need to achieve a maturity status of five for every control you place. Some will 
be more important than others and should receive your attention first.
Manage Information
The only meaningful management information is that which provides the nec-
essary insight to direct management attention and action.
Specifically, you need to know:
That you are compliant with the appropriate policies, 
• 
standards, and controls.
That all business-as-usual activities are being done on 
• 
time and to standard.
That any remediation actions are being completed on 
• 
time.
That when issues have emerged, actions have been sug-
• 
gested to address the issue, who is responsible, when it 
will be done, and how progress will be measured.
When any risks that threaten business continuity appear.
• 
Any other information that affects strategic initiatives. If 
• 
a strategic priority is to increase productivity of staff, for 
example, then you need to have some relevant measure 
of productivity for business continuity management staff, 
and those with BCM responsibilities, so you can demon-
strate how you have supported the initiative.
Personally, I like to have a monthly meeting that covers these or similar topics. 
In my reporting, the focus is by exception—we focus on things that require 
management action. However, I also include a summary of key successes and 
milestones, as management should also have an opportunity to see and praise 
success and progress.

Chapter 10 | Governance and Reporting 
128
Audit Plans and Actions Regularly
Increasingly, audit is a key focus for those involved in business continuity, because 
managing business continuity increases in importance to the organization. In 
addition, more and more industries are becoming regulated and prescriptive, 
and business continuity is a common area of focus for industry regulators. Last 
but not least, it’s increasingly common for business continuity to be a require-
ment of service suppliers as part of any contract that they may try to win.
For all these reasons it’s essential that business continuity is set up properly 
and for you to be able to demonstrate good governance.
To this end, you need to have a robust framework that includes your policy, 
processes, procedures, tools, and documents. Critically, you need to be able 
to demonstrate that you not only have a framework, but also that you are 
following it.
In the real world, you’re not perfect. That’s normal, but what’s important is 
that you know:
Where you’re not okay
• 
Where you are deviating from the framework or where 
• 
it’s not yet been implemented
Where you can demonstrate gaps in your reporting
• 
You also need to be able to show that:
The appropriate people are aware of any gaps
• 
Appropriate and timely actions are planned to improve 
• 
the situation
Audit—normally a separate function in only the larger companies—is won-
derful. I can honestly say that almost everywhere I’ve worked is a better place 
for audit’s presence. For me, audit refocuses away from the solution end of 
things to the overall framework, controls, strategy, and doing what I say!
Having said that, it can be galling at times when you have self-identified issues 
and then you find audit writing you up for them as though they had brought 
civilization to the new world.
Don’t take it personally, but keep your eyes open and think about audit being 
somewhere on the horizon. Don’t wait for the call; make sure that a big part 
of what you are doing day in and day out is improving the governance and 
controls that support business continuity.

  Plan to audit your business continuity plan, policies, standards, and controls regularly. You 
want to uncover problems before anyone else does.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
129
Action Plan
Before moving on, reflect on the following questions and recommendations:
1.	 Do you have a policy that sets out overall business con-
tinuity objectives, accountability, and individual responsi-
bilities? If not, then you’ll need to create a policy that is 
consistent with your organization’s standards.
2.	 Have you set some standards of quality for business con-
tinuity? If not, then you’ll need to review everything in 
the policy and formalize what constitutes an adequate 
standard (e.g., “Call cascade updates will be completed 
annually.”).
3.	 Are the key activities documented so they can be repeated 
to a consistent standard? If not, then you’ll need to look 
at writing processes for the key activities.
4.	 Do you have an ongoing program of activity that is 
designed to ensure that your organization continues to 
meet the requirements of your policy? If not, then you’ll 
need to think about creating one.
5.	 Are senior managers engaged in strategic planning, aware 
of issues, and signing off exposures? If not, then you’ll need 
to think about how to engage them and manage their 
accountability. This might be done through a mixture of 
steering committees, one-on-one meetings, waivers, and 
exception reports.
6.	 Do you have an understanding of how mature your pro-
cesses and capabilities are? Have you decided, for the key 
activities, what the target level of maturity should be? Do 
you have plans to achieve the target level of maturity? If 
not, then consider benchmarking or a similar process that 
will determine the current level of maturity and allow 
you to make some informed longer-term strategic deci-
sions about where you want to go. It will also give you a 
key mechanism for understanding when you have actually 
achieved your targets.
7.	 Does management receive reports that inform them 
when they need to take action? If not, then you’ll need 
to review your reporting. Note: the reason for providing 
reports is so management can identify issues and take 
appropriate action!

Testing 
Principles
Things You Need to Know About Testing
Once you have your plans and solutions, you have to make sure they will 
work. Testing is the principal way of doing this. However, testing has to be 
regular; most organizations and their technology change quickly. This chapter 
covers the reasons testing is so important, some of the most important test-
ing principles, the tests you can administer, and the different scenarios you 
should test for.
Note
■
■
  This chapter goes over the fundamentals of testing and conducting exercises. Chapters 12  
through 14 cover IT testing, business operations testing, and crisis management exercises, 
respectively, in depth.
Why Test?
The simple answer to the question “Why test?” is because business continuity, 
DR, and crisis management are all very complex and have a tendency not to 
work. This is particularly true if you haven’t tested your plans before.
11
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 11 | Testing Principles
134
DR, WAR, and BCP Won’t Work Without  
Testing—and Sometimes Not Even Then
I’ll explain the statement in this header further: In a quarter of a century of 
working in this field and having been involved in thousands of solutions that 
have been created by some of the smartest people on the planet, I suspect 
not a single one would have worked without incident if they had not been 
tested beforehand. If the brain trust can’t get this right, would you bet your 
job, career, or life on the guys in your IT department or indeed yourself?
Further, just because your solution was tested doesn’t mean it will work 
either. Just because you have a test status, a test report, or—worst of all—a 
RAG (red, amber, green) status that says everything is green, it doesn’t mean 
all is well.
Don’t be complacent.
That is the lesson I learned from acquiring other people’s DR solutions after 
business mergers and acquisitions. Most of these inherited solutions came 
with test reports that said the solution had been tested and there were no 
major issues. However, when I tested the solutions for myself, they didn’t 
work. And it’s not because of changes that crept in since the last successful 
test. Many of these “solutions” would never have worked!
I can think of one bank that had a data center DR site that only had network 
links to the production data center it protected. So, if they’d lost the main  
data center, they could have brought up DR, but it would be invisible to the 
business in any scenario where the production site was down!
This sort of thing is quite common. I think it happens when people look at 
DR from the wrong perspective. A common error is thinking that having 
a standby location that replicates their production data center is enough.  
The solution in my example did that, and they had even tested recovering it 
(hence the “green status”), but in designing and testing their DR solution, they 
hadn’t thought about using it in a disaster or tested that eventuality.
Things Change
Another reason why you need to have a routine testing regime is because 
things never stay the same.
As a result, I’d recommend two things:
Test at least annually
• 
Make sure that any changes that affect DR or WAR  
• 
are tested

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
135
What might affect DR and WAR? If you take a moment to think about the 
complexity of either one, you’ll realize how easy it is for things to break down. 
You have environmental factors, hardware, operating systems, middleware, 
applications, databases, network connectivity, batch programs, administration 
suites, static data, external data feeds, business processes, suppliers, and users, 
to name just some of the things that can impair your recovery capability.
Things Are Dynamic!
I’ve already mentioned complexity. This should also highlight the fact that the 
exact situation you have tested is not likely to exist when you come to invoke 
a recovery.
At the most basic level, you may not be using exactly the same hardware,  
software, people, network, or suppliers as when you last tested. So be mind-
ful of what you’re actually testing and what you’ve actually proved. And don’t 
panic. Keep it real and use the issue of complexity to keep regular testing at 
the top of your agenda.
Tip
■
■
  Don’t get complacent. Just because your test worked last year doesn’t mean it will work this 
year. It may not! The only way to truly be prepared is to test and refine your plans.
Pragmatic Testing
Although I advocate testing changes that impact DR, this is not always possible 
for a number of reasons:
The availability of test slots: For example, you might have 
• 
only one time a year when you can test, and you wouldn’t 
want to put off all changes for up to a year.
Risk: Testing is a risky activity, especially if you include live 
• 
operations. In fact, the risk of the change failing and its 
consequent “potential” impact on your business can be 
far less than the risk associated with testing.
Volume of change: Given the number of components 
• 
that can impact DR and the frequency with which these  
can be changed, doing a full DR test for every change is 
neither practical nor sensible.
Clearly then, you need to be pragmatic and flexible. However, this flexibility 
must be exercised within the constraints of some basic principles. At the top 
of that list will be doing a full, end-to-end DR test at least once a year.

Chapter 11 | Testing Principles
136
You Must Be a Realist
Before I proceed on the topic of testing, a word about an area that often 
throws sand in the gears of business continuity: the quest for perfectionism. 
We are cursed with perfectionism; managers in particular expect everything 
to be perfect. They don’t accept imperfection, and all too often frown on bad 
news. This is both unrealistic and unwise. We live in a complex world; things 
rarely work out of the box.
Yes, we need to strive for the best possible solutions and maintain high  
standards. But, keep it real. Keep your eyes peeled for things that don’t work 
or won’t work.
Don’t Shoot the Messenger
The cultural problem with perfectionism is that it creates a climate of fear. In 
general, people become afraid to make mistakes, so they don’t try anything 
different and certainly don’t take on any risks. Perhaps worse of all is that in 
this climate people stop reporting the truth. They tell managers what the 
managers want to hear.
In some cases the managers are overtly creating a culture of perfectionism.  
In two large firms I’ve personally experienced things that have frankly made 
my position untenable and forced me to look for another job.
First, I was told by a chief technology officer to change the “reds” on my report 
to “greens.” At first, I thought, he wants me to fix the underlying problem. But 
he just meant change the report so this major exposure disappeared.
At another firm, a senior manager berated one of her staff for confirming 
when pressed by her boss in a meeting that he’d never seen a report. She 
actually told him that he should have said he had seen it and it was fine.
These weren’t bad people; they were just under huge amounts of pressure. 
Make sure you don’t stop the flow of bad news by being unrealistic and creat-
ing an atmosphere where people are too scared to be open and honest!
When people tell you things are bad or could be better, recognize this as the 
good news it is. Sure, it’s not great if there’s a fault, but better to know how 
things really are than to live in a fantasy world.
Fundamentally, this bad news actually means you’ve just moved from being 
“unconsciously incompetent” to “consciously incompetent.” At last you know 
something now—you know what doesn’t work. Armed with this insight, you 
can get on with sorting things out and making it work.
If someone is at fault, focus on what it is that they’ve done, accept it, and make 
sure they don’t repeat the mistake.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
137
A big part of the role of business continuity is to create a culture where the 
truth can flourish. Part of this is about making this clear to management and 
getting them to agree to it during your steering meetings or similar forums. 
It’s hard in public for anyone to disagree with this point of view.
The other part is about evangelizing this to all the people doing the tests, 
especially IT staff, who often feel huge pressure not to have a “bad test.”
What Testing Proves
You may have proven your test but have you proven you can recover from 
a disaster? This is quite a hard thing to take on board. By testing you have 
proven that the test works. You have not proven DR works unless you actu-
ally invoke it under duress.
Of course if your test involves live invocation, you’re pretty much there! But 
you need to be mindful of the various different scenarios and how each might 
play out. This insight should have a deep impact on your behavior and on 
those you work with.
The implication is that you need to constantly keep looking at your testing 
from different angles. You should use this to create new scenarios to test.
Don’t get me wrong; a successful test result is a big step toward having confi-
dence in the viability of your plan, solution, and the preparedness of the staff 
to execute the plan.
I’d strongly recommend that you:
Review scenarios every year. When considering new sce-
• 
narios, think about the most likely scenarios first. Don’t 
just repeat last year’s test.
Look beyond just technical recovery (i.e., just getting the 
• 
system up). Make the tests progressively more complex, 
introducing more end-user involvement and if possible 
end-to-end processing.
Look beyond live running in DR and start testing the 
• 
return to production from DR.
People Expect You to Test
There is increasing pressure from auditors, regulators, customers, and even 
management to be able to provide evidence that you will be able to recover 
from an interruption to normal business.

Chapter 11 | Testing Principles
138
Consequently, you have to be very methodical in your test approach. You 
need to create evidence of your efforts: the process for setting up the test, 
rationale behind the scenario, and how they fit into your broader strategy.
You must keep excellent records of the tests. Record exactly when events 
happened. You can use the resulting timeline to calculate the actual recovery 
time achieved during the test.
You need to be clear about the realism of your test results. It may take 4 hours  
to recover a system when you have just performed an orderly close down 
and have the right people ready to start with all the resources they need 
ready. That doesn’t give you an accurate feel for how long it would take to 
recover the same system if it were halfway through the overnight batch or 
if it occurred on a normal day but none of the experts were immediately 
available.
You should also keep clear records of any issues that occurred during a test 
and how they were resolved, by whom, and when.
The Stakes Are High, So You Have to Get It Right
Never forget that the stakes are high when it comes to continuity. It’s possible 
that if you fail to recover, then your business itself will most likely fail quite 
quickly afterward.
This isn’t scaremongering; the research backs it up. Deborah Pretty and Rory 
Knight1 have established that businesses that failed to manage business inter-
ruption events effectively saw a significant destruction of shareholder value. 
Many of the businesses Pretty and Knight studied failed altogether. Incidentally, 
those businesses that managed a successful recovery actually saw shareholder 
value rise after a disaster.

  Having a successful recovery can increase the value of a company. Potential investors will 
take that success as a sign of a well-managed firm.
Don’t Waste Money on Solutions That Don’t Work
You’ve spent a lot of money on your recovery solution, so you better be sure 
it works! You’d be amazed at how much money companies spend on their 
recovery strategies but then fail to test them.

139
In practical terms, if you haven’t tested the solution and resolved the inherent 
issues, it won’t work. In other words, you might as well have saved the money 
and not bothered.
Testing Is Just Good Practice
Finally, while all these things add weight to the necessity to test, testing is just 
good practice. Not testing is not just unprofessional—it’s negligent.
Test or Exercise?
Is it a test or an exercise? People use these terms very loosely, and that includes 
myself! For the purposes of this book, the difference is that when testing, the 
principal objective is to identify faults.
By contrast, exercises set out with a more educational agenda that is focused 
on exposing people to their roles and responsibilities. Exercises give people 
and organizations a chance to practice in a safe environment. Part of this pro-
cess highlights faults in processes, real issues that highlight needs for further 
training or awareness.
Note that in identifying faults, I’m not aiming to prove something works.  
I think this is a dubious practice and one that is all but impossible because you 
can only understand what is being tested and understand it in the context that 
it is being tested. In other words, you can prove that the test didn’t find any 
faults within the scope of what was being tested, not that there were no faults. 
This is about the best you can do.
The inability to “prove” something works is of itself not a problem unless you 
start to become unnecessarily complacent. The important thing is to design 
tests that provide the maximum assurance that your plan will work and reveal 
as many possible issues as possible. It’s also important that you keep this 
mindset so that you are alert to different test scenarios for the future and the 
possibility of issues that you don’t know about in the present.
Types of Testing
Before we get into the different types of testing, it’s important to understand 
that the choice of the type of testing needs to be selected with care and with 
a clear purpose in mind.
Some types of test are appropriate for a certain level of maturity. In other 
words, you might want to do technology testing before you do full-blown 
business tests.

Chapter 11 | Testing Principles
140
Commissioning Tests
There’s a logical sequence of testing that relates to the lifecycle of the  
solution. Commissioning is the logical first step that you undertake when you 
have a new solution, be it DR for a system, DR for some critical infrastructure, 
a workplace recovery solution, or the resilience aspect of a new services 
architecture.
In essence, commissioning is the testing you do before a system, service, or 
solution is handed over into “business as usual” so you can be as sure as 
­possible that it will behave and perform as it was designed and meet the 
­overall requirements.
Depending on a number of factors, you may wish to split testing into technol-
ogy and business tests. This is particularly common where the service being 
tested is complex or new.
Technology and Business Tests
Technology testing is an opportunity to discover any issues and iron out any 
problems with the technology without embroiling the business unit or depart-
ment in the tests. It is, if you like, “behind closed doors” testing, so that you can 
fix any technical, processes, procedures, and people issues before you involve 
the business.
Technology testing has lots of obvious benefits. First, it saves a lot of business 
time spent hanging around waiting for stuff to get fixed. Second, when you 
test, you are sending out a powerful message about the solution. Avoid testing, 
and if the business sees performance issue after performance issue, they will 
have pretty low confidence in it. Or they will be working in anger and wonder 
about your competence and your capability to manage this technology for 
them.
Once you are confident that the solution meets its recovery objectives and 
will work from a technical point of view, it’s time to put it through its paces 
and make sure that it actually works.
The key to business testing is to identify all the critical operations that need to 
be performed and how these can be demonstrated. To bring this all together, 
you should work with the business to produce a test script that sets out all 
the tests that are to be performed and who needs to perform them.
Responsibility for producing the test would normally fall to the unit’s own 
business continuity coordinator rather than the central business continuity 
management team. The central team drives the creation of the test scripts, 
gives direction, and supports the business coordinators. It also collects the 
scripts and analyzes the output.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
141
A key area where business continuity adds value is by trying to achieve 
as many synergies as possible. The best way to do that is to minimize the 
­number of people required to test all the critical processes and systems. To 
see what I mean, consider an example where five different departments all 
use the same system in exactly the same way. In this case, you wouldn’t have 
five ­different people brought in to do the same test—one or two would do. 
Business ­continuity managers also add value by making sure that the test 
scripts reconcile with what the business has identified as critical systems and 
activities in their plans.
When looking for synergies and savings, you have to do it in the context of the 
overall objectives of testing. Part of the challenge and art of testing is balanc-
ing often-competing goals such as cutting costs and maximizing involvement 
to increase familiarity with the solution. The test script can help to ensure 
that you have balanced the objectives and make the most of your test time. 
And once created, the scripts ensure that business users methodically test 
everything.
After the commissioning tests, it’s normal to reuse the scripts for test after 
test. However, as part of each subsequent test, you should review your test 
scripts to make sure they still reflect your plans and cover the critical pro-
cesses and systems. It’s also normal to record the actual outcomes of each 
test and any issues and grade the success of each operation directly onto the 
test script.
The analysis of the data from the test scripts forms the backbone of the test 
report, and, hence, all the test scripts need to be gathered before the test ends 
and collated to assess the overall successes and failures.
All issues that arise need to be followed up, and that follow-up process should 
include feeding back to the testers what was done to fix the issue and other 
relevant information such as why something was not an issue.
IT Service Role Swapping
With increased use of resilient architectures that straddle more than one 
location, there is a shift from traditional DR testing, where you bring up the 
contingency machine in the DR site, do a brief test, then return to the normal 
worksite, to switching workload to the contingency site and running produc-
tion for a period of time, normally a week, then swapping back.
I’ve included this, called role swapping, under types of testing, although you 
could argue that it’s not testing but just a business-as-usual process. Many 
organizations routinely switch their workload between sites, sometimes run-
ning for a week before switching back. Then they repeat the switches often.

Chapter 11 | Testing Principles
142
Unlike other tests, there’s no test script because all activities and processes 
are undertaken from the secondary site routinely. There’s no test reporting, 
and any issues are not test issues to be managed by the business continuity 
or IT service continuity team. They are simply business-as-usual issues to be 
escalated as any other production issue would be.
Capacity Testing
With capacity testing, the objective is to prove that capacity meets the likely 
demands that will be placed on a solution in a contingency scenario. (Contingent 
because you roll over to a recovery center contingent upon a disaster or 
interruption in the normal place of operation.)
For most organizations these days, contingency solutions are exact matches 
with the production environments, so they have the same processing, storage, 
and network bandwidth.
In some situations, contingency may present excessive capacity challenges. For 
example, if a service has been down, there may be a backlog of transactions 
to be processed or a surge in demand once it becomes available. In addition 
to IT service recovery, workplace recovery may present a different set of  
challenges. For example, you may find that your recovery facility has to cope 
with a high number of people arriving at the same time that are unfamiliar 
with the site and don’t have access. So how do you get 500 people through 
the door and to their desks and working in 30 minutes in the pouring rain?
Testing Scenarios
You should use scenarios as the focus of your testing approach. By this I mean 
you should aim to test a scenario, not the equipment. For example, rather than 
the aim of the test being “To ensure you can bring up the DR environment,” 
the scenario should be something like “You have lost your head office building, 
which also hosts your production data center.”
You are testing whether you can deal with the scenario without breaching 
your preagreed-to thresholds, like downtime, quality of service, delivery of 
critical activities, and so forth.
Note
■
■
  Testing isn’t about testing sites or equipment per se. Instead you are testing to make sure 
you can meet the standards and thresholds outlined in your plan. That might be recovering a certain 
function in a certain number of hours, delivering a certain quality of service, and ensuring a process 
remains operational, among others.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
143
Focusing on scenarios brings some reality to the test. It forces you to examine 
some issues that may get swept under the carpet otherwise.
In practice, scenarios can relate to multiple tests. So if you lose the head 
office, you have to switch over to DR and invoke your WAR business strategy. 
The selection of the scenario should reflect your risks. So if your data center 
is on a fault line, you should test based on an earthquake first, then work your 
way through the other scenarios in order of risk.
It’s a good idea to coordinate your testing across all locations and keep good 
records of the scenarios tested so you can be sure that all relevant scenarios 
have been tested.
Scenario Suggestions
Here are some suggestions for possible scenarios to test. You should find it 
easy to tailor these or come up with your own or combine them.
Loss of production data center
• 
Denial of access at data center
• 
Power failure at production data center
• 
Generator failure following power loss
• 
Loss of one suite in a data center
• 
Loss of connectivity to the data center
• 
Loss of key office
• 
Loss of secondary data center
• 
Loss of data center that is colocated with a key office
• 
Denial of service attacks on your customer-facing systems
• 
Cyber attack or hack either from external criminals or 
• 
internal employees
Data corruption
• 
Contamination of your production facilities
• 
Supplier failure
• 
Blackmail
• 
Sabotage by a disgruntled employee
• 
When you create your scenario, it’s important to think about the timing of the 
test. It has a bearing on what you will actually have to do in response and by 
implication the range of things actually being tested.

Chapter 11 | Testing Principles
144
For example, if the scenario is the data center loss and you do it during one 
business day, the activities are going to be very different than if you planned it 
to take place after the end of all batch processing and before the start of the 
next day. Take time to think about the limitations of your test and how in the 
future you can test these or otherwise mitigate any related risks.
Conduct Desktop Walkthrough Exercises
Desktop exercises should be the foundation of your overall testing strategy. 
Basically, it involves bringing the key people involved in the recovery together 
and then walking them through a scenario so you can observe how they 
respond and what they say they would do. Ideally, they should work from the 
plan, but in practice people rarely do.
Personally, I like to observe. I let things run a while then call a “timeout.” 
During the timeout, I get the team to reflect on where they are, what they are 
doing, and what they should be doing. If necessary, I direct them back to their 
plan and challenge its validity or, if it is valid, get them to do what it says if they 
have deviated from it.
Desktop Walkthrough Roles
You will ideally have some support during the exercise, as it can be difficult to 
capture all the learning points while you are also driving the exercise forward. 
I like to split responsibilities with a partner, so one of us is focused on driving 
the scenario and the other is observing and doing the timeouts.
You need to be clear about your role, and you need to make that clear to 
everyone attending. Are you “in role,” as the business recovery coordinator 
or IT lead, or are you “out of role” and directing or observing the exercise?
I do not recommend running it and observing it at the same time. So, if you 
need help running or observing the exercise, get it.
Desktop Walkthrough Availability
Obviously, when you do the test, not everyone will be available. If you are 
unfortunate enough to have to invoke your plans for real, key people won’t 
be available. Naturally, then it makes sense for the people doing the exercise 
to rotate. So, for one test have the primary person in role and next time get 
their backup. Try to mix it up so there are not all primaries or backups but a 
mixture of the two.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
145
If you can’t get either the backup or primary person on the day of the test, 
then think about what this would mean if it were a real invocation and not 
just a test.
With this in mind, do you need to make sure you have cover available at all 
times for all key roles, like the primary business recovery coordinator and 
their backup? Should they never be away at the same time? If this is not practi-
cal, will you have to consider having more than one backup?
Leveraging Scenarios
It requires quite a bit of upfront effort to prepare the scenario, but once you 
have the scenario, it can be reused for other departments, locations, or plans. 
This is especially true when it comes to business continuity plans. Here you 
should use the same scenario with all plans each year so you build a compre-
hensive picture of your ability to deal with each scenario and offer assurances 
to management and other stakeholders that you are able to deal with key 
scenarios at an enterprise level.
It’s a good idea to build a library of scenarios so they can be reused with ease. 
It’s also worth networking with peers in your industry and other people doing 
BCM generally, as you’ll probably find they are indeed proud to share their 
scenarios with you.
Tip
■
■
  Network with other business continuity and disaster recovery planners in other companies. 
You can learn a lot from one another about how to deal with specific scenarios.
Level of Scenario Detail
When testing, if you’re not familiar with the plan, you’re in trouble. You will 
need to be very familiar with it so you can give appropriate direction during 
the exercise, detect when the team is off plan, and pick up areas that need 
improvement or lack clarity.
The level of detail you put into the scenario depends on your personal style, 
the culture, and expectations. In my experience, a simple scenario that is well 
structured but lacks visual aids and other bells and whistles works well and 
requires about 10% of the effort to prepare than a technology-rich exercise.
The culture and expectations as well as your ability should determine the 
nature of the exercise. Remember, it’s not what you want or enjoy that 
counts—it’s what’s needed and what the client expects to see!

Chapter 11 | Testing Principles
146
I remember an exercise where a colleague spent weeks of his personal time 
adding video feeds, CNN, and BBC news items, mocked up images, and real 
interaction with the emergency services to create a realistic scenario. It looked 
great, and my colleague and I loved delivering it, but the risk director, who was 
a “no-frills” type, was totally unimpressed and wondered how we’d found so 
much time to do all the bells and whistles. All that she felt was needed was a 
simple script. She was the customer, so that’s what we should have given her, 
or we should have persuaded her that she needed more before we started 
building the scenario.
You live and learn, and making these mistakes is school-boy stuff, but we all do 
it. Believe me, it’s better that someone tells you in advance that your planned 
approach is no good than they think that the final result is no good!
Action Plan
Review the following questions and consider if you need to follow the 
recommendations:
1.	 If you tested services and solutions, how confident are you 
that these would really work if you needed to recover?
2.	 Have you identified the correct types of testing to do, and 
do they evolve appropriately (i.e., desktop walkthroughs, 
technology tests, business tests, and capacity tests)?
3.	 Have you looked at your choice of scenarios, types of 
testing, and test scripts to make sure you are balancing all 
the objectives while balancing costs and disruption?
4.	 Have you tested using the most likely scenarios? Are 
these scenarios changed each test cycle (i.e., every year)? 
Would it be prudent to adopt a different scenario for 
your next test?
5.	 Do you perform regular desktop exercises? If not, review 
the section “Conduct Desktop Walkthrough Exercise.”

Testing 
Things You Need to Know 
Here are the keys to successful IT disaster recovery tests:
Apply basic project management tools to DR tests
• 
Assign roles and responsibility
• 
Use a scenario-based approach
• 
Plan well
• 
Engage management 
• 
Provide the right resources
• 
Test regularly
• 
Manage risk 
• 
Report results quickly
• 
The majority of this chapter expands on these aspects of successful DR 
testing.

Chapter 12 | IT Disaster Recovery Testing 
148
Apply Basic Project Management Tools to 
Disaster Recovery Tests
Although IT DR testing should be part of your business-as-usual activities, 
each test is a project in its own right. Each test has:
A defined starting point
• 
Objectives
• 
Deliverables
• 
Quality standards
• 
Work plan or schedule
• 
Resources
• 
Risks and issues
• 
A defined end point
• 
Furthermore, each test is a unique piece of work. In short, you should approach 
testing with all the rigor that is normal for your organization when undertak-
ing a project of this scale.
How much project management you provide hinges on what’s appropri-
ate. If the test involves one person and only takes a few hours to prepare, 
then clearly you don’t need formal project management. However, what if 
it involves months of preparation, high risks, or the coordination of many 
teams? Then project management is not just useful but should be a mandatory 
requirement.
Again, depending on the scale of the test, you might want to secure the ser-
vices of an experienced and professional project manager. If it’s manageable 
or you have dedicated specialist to manage DR tests, you can skip the project 
manager, but you should still expect the people leading the work to apply basic 
project management methods and tools to the work in accordance with your 
organization’s standards.
Note
■
■
  Key things that you’ll need to focus on before and during tests are securing the right 
resources, managing risks and issues, prebooking test slots, communicating progress and 
expectations, and managing stakeholders.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
149
Assign Disaster Recovery Testing Roles  
and Responsibilities 
Roles and responsibilities can be split among:
Preparatory work
• 
Testing phase: the actual DR test
• 
Observation: observing the test
• 
Issue fix: fixing issues
• 
Let’s look at each of these in greater depth.
Preparatory Roles and Responsibilities 
From my experience, about 80% of the work that goes into a test is preparing 
for the test. Key activities include planning the test, preparing test scripts for 
both technologists and end users, identifying issues that will prevent a success-
ful test, fixing issues, training, writing instructions and supporting documenta-
tion, and component testing.
The majority of this work is undertaken by IT technical staff. However, depend-
ing on the complexity of the test, it can involve dozens of different specialists. 
The following key disciplines are likely to be involved:
Network engineers
• 
Platform or operating systems specialists
• 
Applications support
• 
Middleware support
• 
Database administrators
• 
Data center operations
• 
Storage specialists
• 
Information security specialists
• 
IT service continuity
• 
Change or incident management
• 
Two things are critical to the success of the overall test and being ready for 
the testing phase in particular. These two things are the coordination of all the 
people and ensuring all the actions are captured and resolved in good time.

Chapter 12 | IT Disaster Recovery Testing 
150
Testing Roles and Responsibilities
During the testing phase, there are always people who need to perform criti-
cal tasks in a particular sequence. This requires both planning and efficient 
organization to ensure that the activity moves smoothly between discrete 
disciplines.
Critical to the success of the test is making sure that everyone understands 
their responsibilities and that everyone communicates when they have com-
pleted their tasks to those who are waiting to follow them and anyone who is 
keeping track of progress against the recovery plan.
This cascade is critical when recovering, as you need to keep things moving, as 
well as when testing and you want to capture accurate timings.
Observation Roles and Responsibilities
When testing you need to establish:
Whether the people did exactly what the plan says they 
• 
should have done. If not, then either their behavior needs 
to change or the plans need to change to reflect the cor-
rect actions.
How long it really takes to recover the IT systems and 
• 
how much, if any, data were lost.
What issues arose, and, if they were fixed, exactly how 
• 
this was achieved.
I have to confess that in my days as a systems programmer, I rarely followed 
any plans. Typically, like most of your technical staff, I knew how to do things, 
so I just got on with it.
That was fine, as long as I was available or, in your case, the techy who already 
knows what to do is available. But will someone who knows exactly what to 
do when disaster strikes be available? If the expert is not available and the 
instructions aren’t clear in the plans, you’re in trouble.
Also, another issue is that if your techies just wing your tests and don’t sys-
tematically work through the instructions, you’ll learn nothing about the valid-
ity of the plans, which after all is a key element that is really being tested and 
learned.
While I’m in confession mode, the truth is that while winging it I often fail to 
take the time to make sure the steps I actually performed and the things I 
fixed to make it work were included in the plans.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
151
To be frank, I was too busy trying to get things to work to think about what 
I was doing and keep a record. It’s likely that the vast majority of the people 
who will be doing your recovery will operate in a similar fashion.
One of your planning assumptions should therefore always be that the “expert” 
is unavailable. Your plans must be written so that a competent generalist could 
perform the recovery.
Tip
■
■
  Assume at all times that in a real disaster, the resident expert will not be available. That 
means there should be clear directions at every step that an IT generalist can perform to recover 
systems.
To make sure you improve the plans so they reflect the real recovery steps 
at an appropriate level of detail and that all issues and timings are kept, you 
need to make someone responsible for monitoring the technical recovery 
staff to ensure they are doing exactly what the plans says. They must also 
be correcting any errors in their process and updating the plans to reflect 
these changes.
You must select people for these sorts of observational roles with care. They 
need to have an eye for detail, great people skills, and a thick skin. They need 
to be able to build rapport with the people performing and coordinating the 
recovery activities without getting in their hair. They need to deal with people 
who will probably be very rude and perhaps even aggressive. Trust me—few 
people are more rude and unpleasant than a techy who is being observed and 
forced to conform to a rigorous approach that encroaches on their freedom.
At these times, your observers need resolve and a focus on the objective. 
They need to demonstrate empathy and understanding for people who are 
probably stressed, lacking social skills, thinking that the observer is keeping 
them from doing their job, and are unable to “get” why someone wants to 
know what the issues are.
To make observation as smooth as possible, you need:
A simple command-and-control structure that includes 
• 
the feedback of progress against key milestones (timings) 
and issues.
Clearly defined responsibilities for all those who are per-
• 
forming recovery actions. These responsibilities should 
include recording progress, issues, and deviations from 
the documented recovery steps.

Chapter 12 | IT Disaster Recovery Testing 
152
To make sure that everyone understands why you are 
• 
testing (i.e., “We are testing principally to find issues then 
fix and document them.”).
Two things that can make your life much easier are test scripts and test soft-
ware, as discussed in the following sections.
Test Scripts
Recovery test scripts are a simple tool to ensure that not only the correct 
recovery steps get tested but also that any issues and timings are captured so 
the recovery process can be improved and the overall recovery time objec-
tives can be demonstrated. In its simplest form, they simply set out all the 
recovery steps with suitable space for comments and timings. That way, who-
ever does the recovery can work from the script and keep a record of issues 
and timings in one place.
It’s normal to have separate scripts for the technical staff doing the recovery 
and any business users doing user testing.
Technical Recovery Test Scripts
The technical recovery script is normally a direct extract of the recovery 
procedures that needs to be followed to complete the recovery process. The 
key aims in the technical phase of recovery testing are, first, to ensure that the 
recovery process is effective and adequately detailed for someone of limited 
direct knowledge of the system to complete the recovery. The second aim is 
to gather the timings so you will know if it is possible to meet the businesses 
recovery time objective.
Business Test Scripts
The business test script sets out all the critical business activities. It’s worth 
working through the script with the business contact to make sure it reflects 
all the critical activities they do and make sure that all the systems, files, and 
tools are covered. Be specific and, as far as possible, follow the flow of busi-
ness activities. That way, if something is booked on one system, amended on 
another, and printed on a third system, you can ensure the data are consistent 
among all and that the actual business flow works.
The scope of the test script will reflect the scope of the test. If you are only 
testing the recovery of a single server or service it might not be meaningful 
or possible to test flow.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
153
When designing your testing, think about the impact of what you’re doing and 
any potential risks. Be careful if data are being entered on to live databases or 
can flow from the system being tested to a downstream live system.
There’s no excuse for not having scripts. Not only can they vastly improve the 
effectiveness of your tests, but making them auditable can help to significantly 
reduce the risks associated with testing.
Test Software
The ideal situation in testing is to use automated software, such as Test 
Director, which includes your scripts, captures timings and issues, and, at the 
end, produces instant reporting.
Although preparing scripts is quite easy and inexpensive, software, on the 
other hand, is expensive and more of a strategic decision for your organiza-
tion. But check around in the IT department; someone may already be using 
Test Director or something similar.
Issue Fix for Disaster Recovery Tests 
There’s little point in doing any tests if you’re not going to address any issues 
that emerge while testing.
Have patience when discovering new and unknown issues that threaten the 
viability of your recovery capability. However, don’t be tolerant when it comes 
to discovering an issue that still exists from an earlier test.
I recommend that for any issue:
You identify the person or people who can fix it.
• 
That the senior managers who control resources are 
• 
made accountable for a problem’s timely resolution.
Resources are allocated, work planned, and timescales 
• 
agreed upon to fix the issue.
You monitor the progress of those fixing the issue, ideally 
• 
tracking progress against milestones.
You escalate any failure to progress an issue immediately.
• 
In terms of roles and responsibilities, I’d also recommend that the BCM man-
ager tracks all issues centrally and regularly reviews progress, and that those 
performing the fix are made aware of the timelines and agree-upon mile-
stones, if that is appropriate. Finally, accountable managers must actually be 
held accountable for ensuring that reasonable progress is made.

Chapter 12 | IT Disaster Recovery Testing 
154
Use Scenario-Based Disaster Recovery Testing 
Scenario-based testing is important. The driver here is to ensure that what 
you’re testing is consistent with the organization’s most likely and highest-
impact scenarios. Testing should also contribute to an enterprise-wide under-
standing of the exposure to the key scenarios. In addition, testing should be 
progressive; each subsequent test provides greater confidence in the viability 
of the recovery solution and reduces the overall risk.
I always recommend that if you are doing several DR tests across the orga-
nization, you should align the tests to the same scenario. For example, you 
would dictate that every DR test in a given year should use “loss of power, 
followed by backup power supply failure” as the scenario.
The exception to when you might not want to use the current enterprise test 
scenario is in the case of a one-off commissioning test. This is the testing that 
you do as part of the acceptance process when creating a new DR solution.
For commissioning, I’d use the most likely scenario and generally focus on 
technical recovery. Then, once DR is live and it’s time to do the next business-
as-usual test, fall in with the enterprise scenario for that year.
As I said earlier, our job is to be relentless in the search for issues that might 
prevent a successful recovery. If you don’t find any errors when you test, 
change the test next time and use a different scenario. Never assume that just 
because the past test found no issues there are none.
Note
■
■
  Just because a test went smoothly doesn’t mean your process doesn’t have hidden 
problems. To root them out, try a different scenario next time.
Most don’t consider scenarios when testing. Consequently, their tests are lim-
ited and don’t reveal previously unknown issues. Most tests, by default, oper-
ate with the scenario element that the event has happened after an orderly 
closedown and all batches have been completed. This is because this is when 
most tests are done. The problem is that most outages happen in the middle 
of a production day and are disorderly. Consequently, when people deploy 
their contingency solution for real, a lot of issues emerge that either delay 
recovery or, all too often, render its use more problematic than just having an 
extended outage. This is insane, and you might as well save your money and 
not have any DR.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
155
Plan DR Tests Well 
Successful testing is a product of the effort that goes into preparing for the 
test. Coordinating all the resources, resolving all the issues, and making sure 
that everything happens on time require sound planning.
Engage Management in the Disaster  
Recovery Test
Projects often fail because there’s a lack of resources and a lack of focus. 
Often this is because the accountability for the project isn’t clear. Chances are 
you may feel accountable for the success of what you’re doing, but in practice 
you may not have the ultimate power to ensure that things are resourced and 
issues get escalated. So the sense of accountability will only lead to stress and 
frustration.
Bottom line is that you’re more likely to be “responsible” for doing things 
rather than being “accountable” for making sure they get done, or indeed 
responsible if they fail!
Accountability must be clearly defined and allocated. The person accountable 
must be in a position to secure resources and be able to support those who 
have responsibility for doing the necessary work.
So, make sure that accountability is defined and allocated to a suitable indi-
vidual. If at all possible, avoid having the accountability sitting with a body of 
people, because you’ll find it harder to get the support you need or secure 
quick responses to key questions and requests. Committees rarely feel the 
same sense of “skin in the game” as an individual, and they generally can’t 
respond quickly because there is a built-in lag time that delays decisions until 
the next planned meeting or until you can otherwise secure consensus and 
approval.
Having identified the accountability and allocated it, make sure that the account-
able person is suitably briefed on their accountability, the related work that’s 
planned, and all the key issues that affect them.
Make sure those accountable receive regular reporting. Don’t bury them in 
data, but instead report by exception. That means you report when things 
don’t go according to plan. Tell them about progress against milestones, issues, 
and how they are being resolved, or not.
In practice, you tell them what reporting you’ll be giving them. If they really 
need something different, they will tell you. In my experience, if you ask people 
what they want, you’ll end up having to cut your data 10 different ways to 
accommodate all the different expectations from the different stakeholders.

Note
■
■
  Accountability is different from responsibility. The accountable party typically can dispense 
resources, settle some disputes, provide support, and so forth. Responsibility is about ensuring 
specific tasks are done according to plan. The accountable person, in short, makes sure the 
responsible person can get the required job done.
Disaster Recovery Test Kickoff Meetings
Once you have identified the principal stakeholders in the DR test, get them 
together and agree to:
Test objectives: What do you aim to achieve?
• 
Test scope: What are you going to test and what are you 
• 
not going to test? Be specific at the outset about what’s 
not going to be tested; it makes for clarity later and sets 
clear expectations.
Approach: How are you going to approach the test? For 
• 
example, will you operate as a split site with live users 
working both in production as normal and some contin-
gency workers working from DR?
Test scenario: What scenario is going to be used for plan-
• 
ning the test? 
Metrics: How will you measure success and progress?
• 
Roles and responsibilities: who will do what?
• 
Reporting and regular meetings: How will you report 
• 
progress and issues, and what meetings should there be?
I’d strongly urge you not to use this meeting to figure out all these things. 
Instead, go into the meeting with a set of recommendations, backed with sup-
porting arguments. Use the meeting to challenge them and, where possible, 
arrive at improvements or alternatives.
The reason I make this suggestion is that in my experience, teams are very bad 
at brainstorming these types of ideas; they tend toward procrastination and 
complacence. Teams often work best when given something specific to evalu-
ate and improve. It brings focus and momentum.
I’d also recommend that when you start the meeting, you should already be 
confident that what you are suggesting is going to be broadly acceptable and 
you will have enough support in the room.
After the meeting you should formalize what conclusions were reached with 
regard to the above points by recording them in project documents, such as 

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
157
“terms of reference” or something similar. Then make sure that all stakehold-
ers and senior management review and approve them.
Try to avoid the comprehensive approach to “kickoff” meetings where project 
managers invite everyone and their dog in the hopes of covering everything.
Be focused, only invite people who need to be there and who can make a 
meaningful contribution.
Hold Regular Disaster Recovery Test Meetings
Once the DR test project is under way, it’s essential that you regularly recon-
vene the key people to review progress and identify risks and issues.
Make sure these meetings are brief. Always prepare an agenda and record 
any issues in the minutes. Also, add the details of any salient discussion to the 
minutes, but keep them brief and focus on conclusions and the key supporting 
rationale. Capture actions and issues and make sure they get reviewed each 
time you meet.
Provide the Right Resources
Human resources are always an issue in business, and, in particular, getting the 
right ones at the right time.
DR testing is a little unusual in that for the actual test phase, you may want 
to have a less-experienced resource, one that’s not actually familiar with 
the product or package so that you can test whether the plan is fit for the 
purpose.
When using inexperienced people, you should make sure they receive ade-
quate support. You don’t want them to fail. What you want to do is flush out 
any issue either with the plan or the recovery strategy and, wherever possible, 
fix these things as you go along.
For the rest of the test, you’ll be constrained by the same issues as any busi-
ness activity. You want the right people available when you need them. This 
comes back to good planning, solid stakeholder management, and clear man-
agement accountability, which can be leveraged to secure the resources.
Keep a close eye on the resources that get allocated. It’s pretty common to 
get offered some inappropriate people and for their team managers to just 
leave them to sink or swim.
The key is to monitor progress against milestones. Look for tangible signs of 
progress. Don’t be satisfied with “it’s 80% done” feedback. Get answers, spe-
cifically, to questions like: “What have you done?” “What remains to be done?, 
“What issues do you have?”, and “What issues or barriers do you foresee?”

Chapter 12 | IT Disaster Recovery Testing 
158
If you have doubts about the resources you have been given and they are not 
getting adequate support, escalate it as soon as possible.
Test Regularly
For testing to be effective, it must be conducted regularly. The exact frequency 
is a balance between cost and risk.
In practice, it’s hard to test most large systems more than once a year. However, 
if you leave it for much more than a year, the chance of problems emerging 
increases significantly.
In some rare cases, you may have an obligation to test more than once a year. 
For example, it may be a contractual requirement to test two times a year.
I recommend making testing a key element of your business continuity policy. 
I’d also recommend that you set out some standards, such as critical systems 
must be tested annually; noncritical systems must be tested at least once 
every two years.
Tip
■
■
  Make testing a key element of your business continuity policy. Specify, in particular, the 
frequency you’ll test various critical systems.
Manage Test Risk
You need to remember that testing in and of itself can be a risky business. You 
are moving live data and sometimes you will also be running live systems as 
part of your test.
DR testing comes with a number of risks. These include:
Corruption of live data
• 
Breach of data-protection rules
• 
Breach of security
• 
Outage of production service
• 
Failure to return to normal operations after the test
• 
Impairment to production services—where the test may 
• 
take resources away from production
Taking technical resources away from production,  
• 
support, and critical development work
You should always start with a high-level risk assessment for the test, with par-
ticular focus on impact on production, operational issues, and security issues.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
159
You need to use this insight when selecting your scenario and designing your 
test so that the risks can be minimized and mitigated. Much of the preparation 
work will be directed toward setting things up to minimize or avoid risks.
You should arrive at a point where the risks of doing the test are far less than 
not doing it. If you don’t get to this point, you have to go back to the drawing 
board!
Finally, remember that the risk isn’t yours, and it’s almost certainly not an IT 
risk, although IT may think it is. Whose risk is it? It’s a business risk. So, it’s 
critical that the risk is formally documented and an appropriate risk owner 
identified and made aware. That person should approve the proposed testing.
Report Results Quickly
In testing, you must capture the key learnings, create a set of actions, and make 
them public. If you don’t, the test is not worth your time.
The audience for the reports can be grouped as follows:
Management: Show that everything is okay and, where 
• 
there are issues, you have planned suitable work to fix 
them.
Technical staff: Let them know exactly what the issues 
• 
are, what’s been agreed upon, and who is doing it.
Auditors. Let them see that appropriate controls are in 
• 
place, that you have identified potential breaches, and that 
you are managing them professionally. They will also want 
to see evidence that the tests are consistent with best 
practice and your internal policies.
I find it a good practice to have two test reports: a flash report and a full 
report.
Flash Report
The purpose of the flash report is to get the key test results out quickly. It 
covers success or failure and some basic metrics. It doesn’t include rationale, 
analysis, or recommendations.
It’s ideally issued on the final day of the test, or, at the very least, within a few 
working days of the test finishing.
The flash report summarizes each element of the test and sets out whether 
it was a success or failure. Keep it simple, and use traffic lights or something 
similar so people can look at it and instantly get a feel of how the test went.

Chapter 12 | IT Disaster Recovery Testing 
160
Full Report
The full report is comprehensive and provides evidence and relevant rationale 
to support the findings. However, for the benefit of the majority of its readers, 
the full report should also have a management summary that presents the key 
findings and supporting rationale in one or two pages.
Issue the full report within a month of the test. The exact timing depends on 
completion of the posttest meetings and any related analysis.
The posttest meeting is the forum where all the issues from the test should 
be discussed and actions and owners agreed upon. The full report sets out 
all the issues, actions, timescales, and recommendations. It normally takes  
2 weeks to pull together for a large test, so don’t overpromise. Allow 
additional time if you have to get it past a number of stakeholders who have 
to agree on the findings before it is issued!
Closing a Disaster Recovery Test
You might think that the production of the final report signifies the end of 
the test as a project. However, there’s a need to make a formal distinction 
between the test as a project and ongoing business-as-usual activities.
There’s a danger that your tests could lack a clear end point with issues being 
managed for months or years after the actual tests. It’s important to draw an 
end to the project and transition any lingering issues into business as usual.
I’d strongly recommend that when the final test report is published, you would 
have already transitioned everything related to the test into business as usual. 
The key thing to do is to ensure that all actions are owned and they continue 
to be tracked but not part of the project. In addition to outstanding issues, 
you need to ensure that everything that has been learned as part of the test 
is being used to its fullest.
Finally, you have to move the people who have been working on the project 
back to their normal roles or other projects, and in doing this, it’s very impor-
tant that you provide them and their managers with feedback on their perfor-
mance, contribution, and behaviors. This final people point is often overlooked, 
and people fail to capitalize on the development opportunity or recognition 
for their efforts.
Action Plan
Review the following questions and consider if you need to follow the 
recommendations:

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
161
1.	 If you tested services and solutions, how confident are you 
that they would really work if you needed to recover?
2.	 Have you tested using the most likely scenarios? Are 
these scenarios changed each test cycle, perhaps every 
year? Would it be prudent to adopt a different scenario 
for your next test? 
3.	 Do you perform regular desktop exercises? If not, review 
the desktop walkthrough exercises in Chapter 11
4.	 Are all the issues documented and owned and do they 
have a viable action plan? Do you track your actions to 
make sure that progress is being made? Do you have a 
process to escalate issues? If not, then look at how you can 
embed appropriate action tracking into your processes.
5.	 Are your tests adequately resourced with suitably skilled 
people, and do you give everyone who could be involved 
(alternates as well as primary responders) the chance to 
gain experience?
6.	 Do you test frequently enough?
7.	 Are you identifying and managing the risks associated 
with testing?
8.	 Are test reports produced quickly, and do they provide 
the stakeholders with the information they need?
9.	 Are your tests scripted so they cover the key opera-
tions that are required in recovery and the tests can be 
repeated?
10.	 Are users fully involved with the testing?
11.	 At the time you publish the final test report, do all the 
outstanding risks and issues have owners and action plans 
and are they set up so that they will be managed to com-
pletion after the test is closed?

Things You Need to Know About Work Area 
Recovery Testing
The elements that make up successful WAR (work area recovery) tests are 
the same as those that make up successful IT DR tests:
Apply basic project management tools to DR tests
• 
Assign roles and responsibility
• 
Use a scenario-based approach
• 
Plan well
• 
Engage management
• 
Provide the right resources
• 
Test regularly
• 
Manage risk
• 
Report results quickly
• 

Chapter 13 | Business Recovery Testing
164
The majority of this chapter expands on these aspects of successful business 
continuity testing.
Apply Basic Project Management Tools to 
Work Area Recovery Tests
WAR, just like DR testing, should be part of your business-as-usual activity. 
Each test is a project in its own right as every test has:
A defined starting point
• 
Objectives
• 
Deliverables
• 
Quality standards
• 
Work plan or schedule
• 
Resources
• 
Risks and issues
• 
A defined end point
• 
Each test is a unique piece of work, and you should approach WAR testing 
with the rigor that is appropriate in your organization when undertaking a 
project of a similar scale.
The key to how much project management hinges on what’s appropriate.  
If the test involves one person and takes a few hours to prepare and do it, 
then clearly it doesn’t warrant being wrapped in project management.
If, however, it involves some or all of months of preparation, significant risks, 
and the coordination of many people, clearly project management isn’t just 
useful, but should be considered a mandatory requirement.
Again, depending on the scale of the test, you might want to secure the  
services of a project manager. If it’s manageable or you have dedicated spe-
cialists who normally manage WAR tests, you can skip the project manager. 
However the test is managed, you must expect the people leading the work to 
apply basic project management and to do the work in accordance with your 
organization’s standards.
The key things you’ll need to review are securing the right resources, man-
aging risks and issues, prebooking test slots, communicating progress and  
expectations, and managing stakeholders.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
165
Assign Work Area Recovery Testing Roles  
and Responsibilities
Roles and responsibilities can be split among:
Preparatory work
• 
Testing phase: the actual WAR test
• 
Observation: observing the test
• 
Issue fix: fixing issues
• 
Let’s look at each of these in greater depth.
Work Area Recovery Preparatory Roles and  
Responsibilities
Just like DR, about 80% of the work that makes up a test involves preparing 
for the test. Key activities include planning the test, repairing test scripts for 
both technologists and end users, identifying issues that will prevent a  
successful test, fixing issues, training, writing instructions and the supporting 
document, and component testing.
The majority of this work is undertaken by IT technical staff. However, just like 
DR, depending on the complexity of the test, it can involve dozens of different 
specialists. However, as a general rule the following key disciplines will need 
to be involved:
Networks
• 
Desktop support
• 
Applications support
• 
Change or incident management
• 
Facilities or security
• 
Critical to the success of the overall test and ensuring you are ready for the 
testing is the coordination of all these people and ensuring all the actions are 
captured and resolved in a timely manner.
Testing Roles and Responsibilities
As with any test, there are a number of people who need to perform criti-
cal tasks in the correct sequence. You’ll need to plan in depth and make sure 
your organization is running smoothly to ensure the different disciplines and 
people mesh.

Chapter 13 | Business Recovery Testing
166
Everyone must understand their responsibilities, and everyone must com-
municate when they have completed their tasks to those who are waiting to 
follow them, as well as anyone keeping track of progress against the recovery 
plan.
This sequence is critical when recovering. You need to keep things moving and 
capture accurate timings.
Observation Roles and Responsibilities for Work Area 
Recovery Tests
When testing you need to establish that:
People have actually done what the plan says. If not, then 
• 
either their behavior needs to change or the plans need 
to change.
How long it takes to recover the business and how much 
• 
information is lost, if any.
Any issues that came up were fixed and how.
• 
As always, assume that “experts” are unavailable in the midst of a disaster; 
therefore, write plans so a competent generalist could perform the recovery.
Technicians are also notoriously poor at keeping records of what they do, 
what doesn’t work, or how long things actually take. To be frank, they’re busy 
people, and they’re trying to get things to work, so you shouldn’t be surprised 
if they seem too busy thinking about what they’re doing to keep a record.
To make sure that we improve the plans so they reflect the real recovery 
steps and that these steps are recorded at an appropriate level of detail, make 
someone responsible for keeping records and monitoring what actually hap-
pens. Having an independent observer will enable you to improve your plans 
and capture all issues and timings.
Again, just as for IT DR testing, select people who will not just observe and 
report on testing activity; they must do it all with finesse, as they need to have 
an eye for detail, great people skills, and thick skin.
Observers need to demonstrate resolve and maintain a focus on the objec-
tive. They need to demonstrate empathy and understanding of people who 
may be stressed and probably think that the observer’s questions and pres-
ence are keeping them from doing their job.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
167
To make observation as smooth as possible, you need:
A simple command-and-control structure, which includes 
• 
feedback of progress against key milestones (timings) and 
issues.
Clearly defined responsibilities for all those who are 
• 
performing recovery actions, which includes recording 
progress, issues, and deviations from the documented 
recovery steps.
Recovery scripts and test software can make your life much easier.
Recovery Test Scripts
Just as for IT DR, recovery test scripts used for your WAR solution set out 
all the recovery steps with suitable space for comments and timings. That 
way, the technicians doing the recovery can work from the script and keep a 
record of issues and timings in one place.
Business Test Script
It’s normal to have separate scripts for the technical staff doing the recovery 
and any business users who will be testing at the recovery site.
The business test script sets out all the critical business activities. I’d recom-
mend that you always walk through the business test script with business 
management to make sure that all the critical activities and systems used are 
covered. When preparing the script, be specific and as far as possible follow 
the flow of business activities to make sure the data are consistent between it 
and the actual business flow works.
Think too of the risks when designing your testing. Remember that data being 
entered onto live databases can flow from the system being tested to a down-
stream live system if you’re not careful. I generally get people to go to the 
recovery site and just work as normal but get them to review the test script 
at the start of the day and sign it all off at the end.
There’s no excuse for not having auditable scripts. They improve your tests 
and reduce the risks associated with testing.
Tip
■
■
  It’s worth walking the floor to see where people are against their test scripts. Often what 
you’ll find is that they are either sitting on issues or haven’t done anything yet. If you’re not careful, 
you’ll find that people will come in and do their work and leave without completing the test script.

Chapter 13 | Business Recovery Testing
168
Test Software
The ideal situation is to use automated test software, which includes your 
scripts, captures timings and issues, and produces instant reporting. Test 
Director is a good product; see if your IT department has a copy.
Issue Fix for Work Area Recovery Tests
Address any issues that emerge during the test.
Be positive when it comes to discovering new and unknown issues that under-
mine the recovery capability. Don’t get upset, because it’s the search for issues 
that is the reason for testing—you want to find them and then fix them!
Having said that, don’t be tolerant when it comes to discovering an issue that 
still exists from an earlier test. If this happens, look at this realistically and 
make sure that people don’t commit this crime twice!
For any issue I recommend that:
You identify the person or people who can fix it.
• 
The senior managers who control resources are made 
• 
accountable for a problem’s timely resolution.
Resources are allocated, work planned, and timescales 
• 
agreed upon to fix the issue.
You monitor the progress of those fixing the issue, ideally 
• 
tracking progress against milestones.
You escalate any failure to progress an issue immediately.
• 
In terms of roles and responsibilities, I’d recommend that:
The BCM manager tracks all issues centrally and regularly 
• 
reviews progress resolving the issue.
Those performing the fix are made aware of the mile-
• 
stones, timelines, and the visibility of the issue.
The accountable managers are held accountable for  
• 
reasonable progress.
Use Scenario-Based Testing for Work  
Area Recovery
Remember, you want to test in a way consistent with the types of scenarios 
that are most likely to come about. These will in turn be the most educational 
and useful in case the real thing happens. Finally, they will give you greater 
confidence in your recovery solution.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
169
If you are doing several WAR tests across the organization, align them all to 
test the same scenario. Every WAR test in a given year could use, for example, 
denial of access as the scenario.
Note
■
■
  The exception to running the same scenario in all areas would be the commissioning test 
that you do as part of the acceptance process when creating a new WAR solution. For commissioning, 
I’d recommend using the most likely scenario; then for the subsequent business-as-usual test,  
I’d align with the enterprise scenario for that year.
As mentioned previously, our job is to be relentless in the search for issues 
that might prevent a successful recovery. If you don’t find any errors when 
you test, change the test next time and use a different scenario. Never assume 
because the test finds no issues there are none.
Plan Well for WAR Tests
Successful testing is largely a product of the effort that goes into preparing 
for the test. Coordinating all the resources, resolving all the issues, and making 
sure that everything happens on time require rigorous planning.
Engage Management in Work Area  
Recovery Tests
Projects often fail because there’s a lack of resources and focus. Often this is 
because there’s a lack of effective accountability. You must find ways to engage 
accountable managers in the WAR tests. After all, if you feel accountable for 
the success of what you’re doing but don’t have the power to ensure you have 
the resources you need, you will experience stress and anxiety, which are not 
consistent with success.
Accountability must be clearly defined and allocated. The accountable person 
must be in a position to secure resources and support, no matter who has 
responsibility for specific actions.
Note
■
■
  Avoid accountability resting with a body of people. You’ll find it hard going to get support. 
Committees rarely feel the same sense of responsibility as an individual, and it can be very hard to 
get the required approval when there is no scheduled meeting.

Chapter 13 | Business Recovery Testing
170
Having identified and allocated the accountability, make sure that the account-
able person is suitable and receives regular exception reporting. Don’t bury 
that person in data; detail those things that need attention and are immedi-
ately visible. Report on progress against milestones, issues, and how these are 
being resolved, or not.
In practice, tell them what reporting you’ll be giving them. If they really need 
something different, they will tell you.
Engage Users in Work Area Recovery Testing
Getting the business engaged in WAR testing is critical for two reasons:
It helps to add rigor to the testing. After all, only the 
• 
business users can tell you if their systems and desktops 
work okay.
It familiarizes the business users with the recovery 
• 
strategy, the working environment at the WAR site, and 
the compromises that are part of working in a WAR 
situation.
Integrating Work Area Recovery and IT  
Disaster Recovery
The degree of integration with your data center DR hinges on whether your 
data center is colocated or very likely to be affected by a local event. For 
example, if the data center is on the same flood plain, supplied by the same 
utilities, the same disaster will affect both areas.
If the data center is colocated with business units that require recovery, it’s 
likely that your WAR tests will be integrated with your DR. You will test both 
together, and users at the WAR site will access systems from the DR data 
center, not production services.
If that’s the case, then you should also think about the possibility of a denial-
of-access test that measures the viability of accessing the production services 
from WAR.
If your data center isn’t colocated, you probably won’t normally test accessing 
the services in WAR from the DR location. In other words, when users come 
in to test at the WAR site, they will log on to the normal production environ-
ment because it’s a reasonable assumption that it should be unaffected by a 
scenario that leads to the WAR invocation.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
171
In this case it is also worth occasionally testing access to services from the DR 
site. After all, the odds of losing the data center when you’re already in WAR 
are exactly the same as on any normal day.
So, make this a scenario for one of your tests and routinely prove network 
connectivity every time you test. It should be possible for your network people 
to do, and it demonstrates that people in the WAR site can in theory connect 
to systems that might be running at the DR site.
Never make assumptions about things such as being able to connect between 
sites. You’d be surprised to know the amount of times that I’ve discovered 
there is in fact no network connection between the necessary sites. This is not 
an issue you can resolve that day, as network providers routinely take months 
to provide a connection.
Work Area Recovery Kickoff Meetings
Once you have identified the principal stakeholders in the WAR test, get them 
together and agree upon:
Test objectives: What do you aim to achieve?
• 
Test scope: What are you going to test and what are you 
• 
not going to test? Be specific at the outset about what’s 
not going to be tested; it makes for clarity latter and sets 
clear expectations.
Approach: How are you going to approach the test? For 
• 
example, will you operate as a split site with live users 
working both in production as normal and some contin-
gency workers working from DR?
Test scenario: What scenario is going to be used for plan-
• 
ning the test?
Metrics: How will you measure success and progress?
• 
Roles and responsibilities: Who will do what?
• 
Reporting and regular meetings: How will you report 
• 
progress and issues, and what meetings should there be?
Don’t expect this meeting to do your job for you! Rather, go into the meeting 
with a set of recommendations, backed with supporting arguments. Use the 
meeting to get input, challenge what you’re proposing, get people to buy into 
the test approach, and, if possible, arrive at improvements to your suggestions 
or more viable alternatives.
Teams work best when given clear boundaries, time limits, and something to 
critique and improve. It brings focus and momentum.

Chapter 13 | Business Recovery Testing
172
After the meeting you should formalize these points by recording them in 
a project document (e.g., a project charter, terms of reference, etc.) that all 
stakeholders and senior management must review and approve.
Invite only those who need to be there and can make a meaningful 
contribution.
Hold Regular Work Area Recovery Meetings
Once the WAR test project is under way, it’s essential that you regularly 
reconvene the key people so you can jointly review progress and identify risks 
and issues.
Make sure these meetings are brief. Always prepare an agenda and record 
any issues in the minutes. Also, add the details of any salient discussion to the 
minutes, but keep these brief and focus on conclusions and the key supporting 
rationale. Capture actions and issues and make sure they get reviewed each 
time you meet.
Provide the Right Resources
Getting the right human resources at the right time is always an issue in 
business.
WAR testing, like DR, is unusual in that for testing purposes you may want 
to have a less-experienced person, one who is not actually familiar with the 
process they will have to follow. Using people who don’t already know what 
they will have to do forces technically minded people to use the plan, and, in 
doing so, it allows you to test that the plan is fit for purpose.
Make sure everyone has support; you don’t want them to fail because they 
lack basic skills. You want to flush out issues with the plan or recovery strat-
egy and wherever possible fix these things as you go along. In particular, if you 
find an issue you want to fix, do it as quickly as possible so that the test can 
continue to its end.
As ever, monitor progress against milestones and look for tangible signs of 
progress. Don’t be satisfied with the people telling you things like “It’s 80% 
done.” Find out specifically what’s been done, what needs to be done, and 
what challenges they faced.
Test Regularly
Conduct testing regularly. How often? That’s a balance between cost and risk.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
173
In practice, it’s hard to persuade business units to take time out of their plan-
ners to test more than once a year. However, if you leave it for much more 
than a year, the chance of problems emerging increases significantly.
If your WAR is provided by a third party, there will almost certainly be restric-
tions on when you can test and how often. Most mature organizations book 
their test slots more than a year in advance.
In practice, this means that slots are not generally available at short notice.
Most contracts restrict you to a single test a year, so you will have to make 
the most of this testing time. It’s thus important that you think about future 
constraints like this when you are preparing the contract with the supplier. If 
it will take you 5 days to recover and test your business, then 3 days a year 
isn’t enough!
Like DR, I’d recommend making WAR testing a key element of your policy 
and set out some standards. A simple example might be something like critical 
systems must be tested annually, noncritical at least once every 2 years.
Manage Test Risks
You need to remember that testing at your recovery site in itself can be a 
risky business. You’re moving live data and sometimes running live systems as 
part of your test.
This comes with a number of risks:
Corruption of live data
• 
Breach of data protection rules
• 
Breach of security
• 
Outage of production service
• 
Failure to return to normal operations after the test
• 
Degradation of production services (e.g., where the test 
• 
may take resources away from production)
Taking technical resources away from production, support 
• 
and critical development work
You need to do a high-level risk assessment for the test, with particular focus 
on production, operational, and security issues. Use this insight when select-
ing your scenario and designing your test, so that the risks can be minimized 
and mitigated.

Note
■
■
  Much of the preparation work should be directed toward setting things up to minimize or 
avoid risks. You should arrive at a point where the risks of doing the test are far less than not doing 
them. If you don’t get to this point, you have to go back to the drawing board!
Document the risk formally and identify an appropriate risk owner. Make sure 
that person is aware of the risk and approves the proposed testing.
Report Results Quickly
It’s of no value to test if you don’t capture the key lessons, create a set of 
actions, and make them public.
There are three audiences for testing reports:
Management, who will want assurance that everything is 
• 
okay and that where there are issues there is a suitable 
work planned to fix them.
Technical staff, who will need to know exactly what the 
• 
issues are, what’s been agreed upon, and who is doing it.
Auditors, who will want to see that appropriate controls 
• 
are in place and that breaches are identified and profes-
sionally managed.
Just as with DR, I find it a good practice to have two test reports: flash reports 
and full reports.
Flash Report
Use the flash report to get the results published quickly. Assess success or 
failure and provide some basic metrics. Don’t include rationale, analysis, or 
recommendations.
Issue it, ideally, on the final day of the test or, at the very least, within a few 
working days of the test finishing.
The flash report summarizes each element of the test and states whether the 
test was a success or failure.
Full Report
The full report is comprehensive and provides the evidence to support the 
findings and any appropriate rationale. It should also have a management sum-
mary that presents the key findings and supporting rationale.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
175
Issue the full report within a month of the test. Make sure it states all the 
issues, actions, timescales, and recommendations. It normally takes 2 weeks to 
pull all of this together for a large test, so don’t overpromise, especially if you 
have to get it past a number of stakeholders first.
Closing a Work Area Recovery Test
The final report doesn’t signify the end of the test as a project. You must make 
a formal distinction between the WAR test project and ongoing business-as-
usual activities.
But it’s important to draw an end to the project and transition any lingering 
issues into business as usual.
I’d strongly recommend that when the final report is released, you transition 
everything related to the test into business as usual. The key thing to do is to 
make sure that all actions are owned and they continue to be tracked but not 
as part of the project. In addition to outstanding issues, make sure that every-
thing that has been learned as part of the test is being used to its full.
Finally, you have to move the people who have been working on the proj-
ect back to their normal role or other projects, and in doing this it’s very 
important that you provide them and their managers with feedback on their 
performance, contribution, and behaviors. This final people point is often over-
looked, and people fail to capitalize on the development opportunity or get 
recognition for their efforts.
Action Plan
Review the following questions and consider if you need to follow the 
recommendations:
1.	 If you tested services and solutions, how confident are you 
that these would really work if you needed to recover?
2.	 Have you tested using the most likely scenarios? Are 
these scenarios changed each test cycle, such as every 
year? Would it be prudent to adopt a different scenario 
for your next test?
3.	 Do you perform regular desktop exercises?
4.	 Do you document all issues, are they owned, and do they 
have a viable action plan? Do you track your actions to 
make sure that progress is being made? Do you have a 
process to escalate issues? If not, look at how you can 
embed appropriate action tracking into your processes.

Chapter 13 | Business Recovery Testing
176
5.	 Are your tests adequately resourced with suitably skilled 
people, and do you give everyone who could be involved 
the chance to gain experience?
6.	 Do you test frequently enough?
7.	 Are you identifying and managing the risks associated 
with testing?
8.	 Are test reports produced quickly and do they provide 
the stakeholders with the information they need?
9.	 Are your tests scripted so they cover the key opera-
tions that are required in recovery and the tests can be 
repeated?
10.	 Are users fully involved with the testing?
11.	 At the time you publish the final test report, do all the 
outstanding risks and issues have owners and action plans 
and are they set up so that they will be managed to com-
pletion after the test is closed?

Crisis 
Management 
Exercising
Things You Need to Know About Exercising
Crisis management exercises are all about giving the crisis management team 
a chance to experience in a safe environment the potential issues they could 
face so they can hone their skills, get used to their responsibilities, learn to 
work as a team, and test the details of their plans and any supporting facilities 
and tools. Typical exercises are conducted—with the whole team present—
normally in the chosen crisis command room and in the form of a role play. 
Team members are informed of the background to the scenario being tested, 
then asked to operate as a team and respond in role as information is fed into 
the team by a facilitator
The scenarios generally relate to common impacts and so involve things such 
as the loss of a site, loss of IT, loss of staff, supplier failure, or something that 
threatens to damage the reputation of the organization. Exercises can range 
from very basic paper-based desktop exercises to very elaborate affairs with 
actors playing roles, mocked-up news reports, and physical relocation of the 
crisis team during the exercise to the recovery site or alternate crisis room.

Key Elements in Crisis Management Exercises
The key elements that contribute to a successful crisis management exercise are:
Meaningful scenario
• 
Successful outcome for the people taking part
• 
Developing the crisis management team
• 
Improving the crisis management process
• 
Demonstrating the appropriateness of the materials
• 
Good input for the exercise
• 
Using timeouts
• 
Planning well
• 
Engaging management
• 
Conducting exercises frequently
• 
Reporting quickly and accurately
• 
Setting roles and responsibility
• 
The majority of this chapter expands on these aspects of successful crisis 
management testing. The key purposes of the crisis exercise can be split 
between:
Making sure that the crisis management process team 
• 
and plan are effective
Training the members of the crisis management team in 
• 
their roles and the likely scenarios they could face
In general, crisis management exercises carry little risk, and as such they  
don’t need the coordination of a variety of work streams or technical resources 
as you would see with disaster recovery (DR) and work area recovery  
(WAR) tests.
Most of the work involves preparing the scenario and organizing the actual 
exercise. Consequently, there’s no need for the same focus on project man-
agement and planning that you have with IT DR and WAR tests.
Choose a Meaningful Crisis Scenario
The selection of the scenario has a direct effect on the extent and effec-
tiveness of the crisis exercises, the development of the crisis team, and the 
improvement of the crisis management processes and plans.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
179
The scenario should:
Be consistent with the organization’s most likely and 
• 
highest-impact scenarios.
Develop an enterprise-wide understanding of exposure 
• 
to the key scenarios.
Prepare the crisis leadership team to deal with a possible 
• 
real-world crisis.
Target any specific development needs that exist within 
• 
the crisis team.
Provide management with some insight into the key risks 
• 
to which the organization is exposed.
Help to justify the ongoing business continuity and DR 
• 
program.
Be progressive in that each subsequent exercise provides 
• 
greater confidence in the effectiveness of crisis man-
agement and the viability of the recovery solution that 
underpins it.
If possible and sensible, I recommend that you align the exercises with the sce-
nario being used for DR and WAR testing. If you haven’t decided on a scenario 
for all DR and WAR tests, I’d recommend either:
Selecting a realistic scenario that could lead to the great-
• 
est impact on your organization.
Selecting a scenario that’s topical within your organiza-
• 
tion, industry, or the world at large (e.g., a flu pandemic).
Select a scenario that ensures the maximum number of 
• 
participants are actively involved in the crisis response.
People Need a Successful Outcome
When selecting a scenario and preparing the exercise, it’s critical that you pick 
something in which the crisis management team will ultimately be successful.
You can’t plan how the team will respond to the scenario or the timing of all 
the inputs they will receive during the exercise. However, you should plan a 
viable outcome and, if the team starts to falter, you should redirect it toward 
this successful conclusion, making sure that the errors and deficiencies are 
captured.

Chapter 14 | Crisis Management Exercising
180
Developing the Crisis Management Team
Managing a crisis successfully depends on having people with the right skills 
and the know how needed to respond to the types of events that an organiza-
tion may face.
Modern organizations tend to be quite democratic, devolved, and distributed. 
They can operate with high degrees of autonomy and empowerment. But 
managing a crisis requires a simple command-and-control structure.
To successfully manage a crisis, you need someone who’s in control and you 
need rapid communication of the salient information and the ability to quickly 
provide direction to those people who are required to act.
Because of these demands, it’s important that the crisis management team is 
well rehearsed in their roles and responsibilities and all the lines of commu-
nication are fully tested.
Note
■
■
  Command and control can be at odds with the normal way of operating your organization, 
so make sure you plan and train for it.
Improving the Crisis Management Process
One of your principal aims in conducting exercises is to improve the crisis 
management process. Your choice of scenarios and your choice of personnel  
influence the extent that the exercise will help you improve the overall 
process.
However, there will only be improvements if you take on board what you 
observe, fix the issues, and improve the processes after the exercise.
Don’t be too hard on yourself; the process of improvement never really ends, 
although you should see the number of improvements steadily being reduced 
with each subsequent exercise.
Likewise, don’t rest on your laurels, as a permanently stable environment is 
unknown in the real world. Things change, and hence you must keep looking 
for things you need to improve—in your plans, in your teams, in your relation-
ships, in your communication, in your escalation, in your decision making, in 
your feedback loops, and in your solutions.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
181
Make Sure Exercise Materials Are Appropriate
An easy mistake is to prepare the exercise for yourself, an exercise that 
you love but not one the customer of the exercise needs or can relate to. 
Make sure you engage with your stakeholders, especially the manager who is 
accountable for crisis management in your organization. Make sure that what 
you produce is aligned to your organization’s expectations. Don’t deliver an 
amazing multimedia exercise with a cast of thousands if what your organiza-
tion believes is needed is a simple paper-based exercise with you providing the 
inputs from the front of the room.
Employ Quality Inputs to the Exercise
Inputs, or injects, as they are often called, are how you feed information into 
the exercise. Like materials, the inputs must be in keeping with expectations.
There are many choices when it comes to injects, which include:
Phone inputs, where you get people to role play on 
• 
incoming calls
Handouts
• 
Visuals, where you put up the content of the input on a 
• 
screen for everyone to read
Role play, where people enter the room to deliver their 
• 
input
Business recovery teams, where the crisis management 
• 
team consults the people responsible for doing the 
recovery actions and feeds back their responses to the 
crisis management team
Directions, where you provide the input as an update to 
• 
the exercise
Media, where you provide inputs via simulated news 
• 
flashes, radio broadcasts, Web pages, and so forth
The key thing is to keep in mind the scenario and overall goals of the exercise 
when you plan the inputs so you can identify inputs that will move the sce-
nario forward or expose key risks and issues.
Don’t be rigid once the exercise is under way. If an exercise inject is no longer 
valuable, don’t just deliver it because you have prepared it. It can confuse the 
exercise and impair progress.

Chapter 14 | Crisis Management Exercising
182
Tip
■
■
  Be prepared to think on your feet. If things are stalling, improvise injects that will get them 
moving or take a time out to get the team refocused and back on schedule.
Use Timeouts
Timeouts—pauses in the middle of the crisis exercise—are invaluable as they 
provide an opportunity to:
Reflect on progress
• 
Allow participants to step outside their roles and see 
• 
events from different perspectives
Reconsider the current approach and in particular assess 
• 
if what they are doing is going to achieve a successful and 
expedient conclusion
Reflect on key learnings from the exercise so far and 
• 
record these learnings as actions to improve crisis man-
agement in the future
The format is simple. Just call the exercise to a temporary halt. Ideally every-
one should be aware that you may call timeouts and what to expect.
Engage Management
Like any endeavor, your crisis management exercises will succeed or fail 
depending on the quality of your management engagement.
Unlike other projects, this has less to do with accountability and securing 
resources and everything to do with perception and input.
Make sure you have discussed at length the objectives of the exercise and that 
key management stakeholders agree with your approach and goals. Make sure 
you have dealt with all their concerns or objections and respectfully taken on 
board their input.
There should be no surprises, although the actual scenario may not be known 
if they have a role to perform. In other words, everyone should enter the 
session knowing what to expect, what they have to do, and how to do it, but 
unaware of the exact scenario or the inputs they will have to deal with.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
183
Rotate Participants
Crisis management exercises are like WAR and DR tests in that you may want 
to include the alternates and not just the principal players. Basically, for each 
role on the crisis management team you should have a primary person and 
some named backups who can cover if the primary is unavailable. Using these 
alternates during the exercise helps to test whether the plan is fit for a specific 
purpose. Having different people involved can also provide a fresh perspective 
on the process and how it could be improved.
When you use inexperienced people, you should make sure they have sup-
port. You don’t want them to fail. What you do want is to flush out any issues 
with the plan or with the recovery strategy and, wherever possible, fix these 
things as you go along.
Ideally, each time you test you want to have a mix of primary and backup 
people in play, much as you’d see on any real working day.
One of the keys is to track who has been involved in exercises and make sure 
that over time everyone gets an opportunity to take part and perform their 
allocated role. You might want to allow backup resources to observe. This is up 
to you, but if you do, there needs to be some basic ground rules in place. For 
example, they can stay in the room but they may not engage with anyone.
Conduct Crisis Exercises Frequently
For testing to be effective, it must be conducted regularly. The frequency is a 
balance between benefits and costs.
In practice, it’s hard to persuade managers to schedule exercises more than 
once a year. However, if you leave it go for much more than a year, the chances 
of problems emerging increase significantly, as do the gaps in the knowledge 
of your crisis management team.
Like DR and WAR, I recommend making regular crisis management exercises 
a key element of your policy supported by written standards.
I include some high-level policy statement, such as “Crisis management exercises  
must be carried out at least annually,” in the policy. Then, in the standards,  
set out exactly what constitutes an exercise, what reports should be  
produced, and so on. Add guidelines such as “All primary role holders must 
have been involved in an exercise in the past 2 years” and “All role holders 
must be briefed on their roles and responsibilities.”
Of course, you need to do what is normal for your organization, unless doing 
nothing is normal, in which case do break with tradition and do something! 
However, if there are no standards as such in your organization, then put it all 
in the policy.

Chapter 14 | Crisis Management Exercising
184
Report Frequently and Accurately
There’s little point exercising if you don’t capture the key lessons, create a set 
of actions, and share it with the key stakeholders.
As with the other tests, there are three audiences for testing reports:
Management, who wants assurances that everything is 
• 
okay and that you can or have fixed issues that came up.
Technical staff, who wants to know exactly what the 
• 
issues are, what’s agreed upon, and who is responsible for 
fixing the issues.
Auditors and control functions, which indicate whether 
• 
appropriate controls are in place and that you are iden-
tifying and managing breaches. They will also want to see 
that the tests are being conducted in keeping with your 
internal controls (i.e., your policy).
I find it good practice to have a single report issued within a month of the test. 
Unlike DR and WAR, I don’t advocate a flash report for crisis exercises, but 
this is a personal preference.
The single report is dependent on a postexercise meeting, where all the issues 
should be discussed and actions and owners agreed upon. The report sets out 
all the issues, actions, timescales, and recommendations. Plan to take up to 2 
weeks to pull together the report for a large exercise.
Exercise Roles and Responsibilities
Roles and responsibilities can be split among:
Preparation
• 
Exercise management
• 
Exercise participation
• 
Observation
• 
Issue fix
• 
Preparatory Roles and Responsibilities
Unlike DR and WAR, the majority of the preparation for an exercise is 
not about risk avoidance and clearing old issues. However, like WAR and 
DR, about 80% of the work that makes up a test involves the preparation,  

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
185
mainly focused on designing the exercise and preparing the materials. Key 
activities include:
Selecting the scenario, including goals and learning 
• 
outcomes.
Writing out the scenario.
• 
Preparing materials and inputs.
• 
Briefing all the people who will assist with the exercise, 
• 
like those creating exercise inputs, etc.
Conducting walkthroughs to iron out issues with the 
• 
flow, timing, etc.
Fixing issues that may be lingering from earlier exercises.
• 
Training and briefing new crisis management team mem-
• 
bers on their roles and responsibilities.
The majority of this work is undertaken by the business continuity manager, 
unless you are lucky enough to have some dedicated crisis management people.
Exercise Management
After all the hard work preparing the exercise, it would be tragic to leave the 
day to chance, so good leadership and control of the exercise are essential.
This depends on:
The preparation you have done
• 
The details of the scenario
• 
How familiar you are with the scenario details and the 
• 
context within the organization
It’s also linked to your willingness to follow what you have prepared. Avoid 
winging it at all costs, but always be on the lookout for the unexpected or 
slippages and be prepared to adapt your plans as you go.
Tip
■
■
  Doing dry runs is an excellent way of preparing. Do it first on your own, then get some other 
people in. It’s amazing how quickly you can come to realize how your excellent written word comes 
out sounding affected or wooden, or how the scenario just doesn’t flow or has too many injects for 
the time allowed.

Chapter 14 | Crisis Management Exercising
186
Trust me, no matter how good you are at preparing scenarios, there will be 
plenty of areas that can be improved and probably some that are just plain 
awful. Better to find this out doing a dry run than in front of the board of your 
company!
The quality of materials is also a key factor, so the advice again is to try them 
out first. Don’t just trust your judgment; run them past as many people as 
possible early on. Don’t be shy, and remember nobody is perfect, but the best 
people iron out the creases in their work at their leisure.
Exercise Participation
We’ve touched on rotation of personnel and ensuring that the backup people 
get a chance to sit in the hot seat.
The other thing to ensure is that you have all roles filled. The exercise will 
falter if, say, your IT crisis team member doesn’t show up.
When planning an exercise, be both empathetic to the fact that people are 
busy but also unequivocal about the need for people to attend. If they can’t 
commit the time, then drop them as a team member; they are of no benefit 
to you.
Something else you have to weigh as you look at participants is whether they 
really are the right people to undertake their responsibilities. Just because your 
chief operating officer is accountable for crisis management doesn’t mean he’s 
the best person to take on the role of crisis leader. This is a tough call, but, not 
having the right people in place if a disaster strikes will be far tougher.
Observation Roles and Responsibilities
As part of the exercise, you need to establish:
That people actually do what the plan says. If not, then 
• 
either their behavior needs to change or the plan needs 
to change.
That the crisis team has the talent, skills, and knowledge 
• 
to discharge their responsibilities.
Whether there are any issues with the current plan, peo-
• 
ple, processes, controls, resources, or tools.
Whether there are any ways that the crisis management 
• 
process or materials can be improved.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
187
In my experience, just as with DR and WAR technicians, members of the 
crisis management team rarely follow the plans. That’s because they get their 
adrenaline up and leap into action.
This is a key thing to observe, and it’s a key thing to focus on when you 
call your timeouts. Redirecting people back to their plans, like any directions 
offered in the timeout, is best done in a coaching style. Ask questions and get 
people to identify the issue and reiterate to you what they should be doing.
Again, like technicians, members of the crisis management team are often 
quite bad at ensuring that the steps they actually perform are included in the 
plans. One of the planning assumptions should always be that the key people 
are unavailable, so plans must be written so that any competent business man-
ager could perform the crisis management responsibilities.
Keeping records of what people do, what doesn’t work, or how long things 
take is important, but it shouldn’t be as much of an issue as it is for IT DR or 
WAR exercises. In general, much of the detail is captured in any case. It should 
be someone on the crisis management team’s responsibility to scribe for the 
team, and issues, actions, and timings are among the key things that should be 
recorded by the scribe. But you need to observe how effective the scribe is 
and how well the information is used by the crisis leader and the rest of the 
crisis management team.
Keep your eyes open for improvements, note them, and either feed them back 
during timeout or include them in the posttest review or final reporting.
Just like with DR and WAR, you must select the people for observation with 
care. They need to have an eye for detail, great people skills, and thick skin. 
They also need to be confident working with the senior people who make up 
your crisis management team.
With regard to observation, you should also bear in mind it’s very hard to be 
an objective or comprehensive observer if you have a significant role in the 
actual exercise, such as being a member of the crisis team responding to the 
scenario or as the facilitator who is delivering the exercise.
Issue Fix Roles and Responsibilities
There’s little point in testing if you’re not going to address any issues that 
emerge.
Have patience when it comes to discovering new and unknown issues that 
undermine the viability of your crisis management team, their plans, or mate-
rials. Don’t be tolerant when it comes to discovering an issue that still exists 
from an earlier exercise.

Chapter 14 | Crisis Management Exercising
188
Consequently, I recommend that for any issue:
You identify the person or group that can fix it.
• 
Senior managers who control these resources are made 
• 
accountable for the issue’s timely resolution.
Resources are allocated, work planned, and realistic  
• 
timescales are agreed upon to fix the issue.
You review general progress and progress against the 
• 
timescales regularly.
You escalate any failure to progress immediately.
• 
In terms of roles and responsibilities, I’d recommend that:
The continuity manager tracks all issues centrally and 
• 
regularly reviews progress.
Those performing the fix are made aware of the timelines 
• 
and visibility of the issue.
The accountable managers are held accountable for rea-
• 
sonable progress.
Closing a Crisis Exercise
The production of the final report does not signify the end of the exercise. But 
you do need to make a formal distinction between the exercise as a project 
and ongoing business-as-usual activities.
There’s a danger that your tests can lack a clear endpoint, with issues being 
managed for months or years after the actual tests.
It’s thus important to draw an end to the project and transition any lingering 
issues into business-as-usual issue management so that nothing gets lost but 
you can move on.
The key thing is to ensure that all actions are owned and they continue to be 
tracked but not as part of the project. In addition to outstanding issues, you 
need to ensure that everything the organization learned as part of the test is 
being used to its fullest.
Finally, you have to move the people who have been working on the crisis exer-
cise project back to their normal roles or other projects, and in doing this, it’s 
very important that you provide them and their managers with feedback on 
their performance, contribution, and behaviors. This final people point is often 
overlooked and people fail to capitalize on the development opportunity or 
recognition for their efforts.

Action Plan
Review the following questions and consider if you need to follow the 
recommendations:
1.	 If you tested services and solutions, how confident are you 
that these would really work if you needed to recover?
2.	 Have you tested using the most likely scenarios? Are 
these scenarios changed every year? Would it be prudent 
to adopt a different scenario for your next exercise?
3.	 Do you perform regular desktop exercises?
4.	 Are all the issues documented, owned, and lead to a via-
ble action plan? Do you track your actions to make sure 
that progress is being made? Do you have a process to 
escalate issues? If not, then look at how you can embed 
appropriate action tracking into your processes.
5.	 Are your tests adequately resourced with suitably skilled 
people? Do you give everyone who could be involved the 
chance to gain experience?
6.	 Do you test frequently enough?
7.	 Are you identifying and managing the risks associated 
with the exercises?
8.	 Are exercise reports produced quickly and do they pro-
vide the stakeholders with the information they need?
9.	 Are your exercises scripted so they cover the key opera-
tions that are required in recovery and the exercises can 
be repeated?
10.	 Are users fully involved with the exercises?
11.	 At the time you publish the final exercise report, do all 
the outstanding risks and issues have owners and action 
plans and are they set up so they will be managed to 
completion after the exercise is formally closed?

Maintenance
Maintaining Your Plans, Solutions, and Skills
Maintaining your plans and solutions is essential if your recovery plan is going 
to work on the day you need it to. This chapter sets out what you’ll need to 
do to maintain a plan and the best way to go about it.
Never Forget: Disaster Recovery Is an Essential 
Function
The most important principle to grasp—and to promote in your organiza-
tion—is that disaster recovery (DR) is a part of any production capability. 
When I say DR, I really mean all recovery solutions, so this applies to business 
recovery as well as IT.
There’s a tendency for organizations to treat DR in the same way they treat 
their IT development and IT testing. In other words, it’s treated as noncritical. 
And like many noncritical activities, DR is often outside any formal change 
controls. In other words, if a significant change is planned or occurs, DR plans 
aren’t automatically updated to reflect the change.
A multitude of issues arise whenever changes to the production environment 
are dealt with separately from DR or WAR (work area recovery). Inevitably, 
when there are poor controls, production and your recovery solutions get 
out of step, and, once out of step, they can’t be relied on.
If you find that every time you prepare a test you are sweeping up changes 
from the production environment and updating your recovery solutions, then 
clearly you have a major problem. Obviously, this is unacceptable because of 
the risk it entails. However, from an operating perspective, it highlights a major 
inefficiency as the cost of applying all of these changes twice is considerably 
more than doing it once.

  Work to make sure any changes in the production environment are reflected, in close to real 
time, in your DR plan.
Review Change Management Processes and 
Controls
It’s essential that business and IT recovery is covered by your organization’s 
change process and controls. Don’t go reinventing the wheel! The basics that 
you need to have in place are:
Employ gateway controls. At each stage of your change 
• 
process, you should have a check to make sure business 
continuity and DR have been included in any changes.
Avoid the “Is business continuity impacted by this change, 
• 
yes or no?” type of questions. It’s too easy for people 
who don’t appreciate the impact or who just want to 
bypass it to answer “No.”
Make it harder to get changes through that don’t impact 
• 
business continuity by requiring any exceptions (i.e., 
things that don’t impact WAR or DR) to be approved by 
the product or service owner.
Make gateways formal. It’s not good enough to just include 
• 
business continuity in a checklist. Any changes need to be 
formally signed off.
Never lose sight of accountability. Whoever is account-
• 
able for production should also be accountable for DR in 
that area and also held accountable when and where gaps 
become apparent.
Those responsible for making changes need to be made 
• 
aware that business continuity and DR are part of their 
responsibilities.
Identify Events that Trigger Business 
Continuity Management Reviews
Many changes become apparent when you prepare for the annual test. This, 
again, highlights the risk that when you need to invoke DR plans, they won’t 
work. In addition to changes in management, it’s worth identifying trigger 

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
193
events that require a review of business continuity. Good examples that might 
constitute a trigger event include:
When production volumes change by more than 40%
• 
When staff increases by more than 30%
• 
When revenue increases by 50%
• 
When the main processing is moved offshore
• 
These are common examples, but the exact trigger events must be relevant 
to your business.
Use the trigger event to review the business continuity provisions. For exam-
ple, if staff increases, do you still have enough seats in an alternate worksite? 
Will they be available soon enough? Or if sales increase, will the existing IT 
infrastructure or telephony still support the required volumes? As you’ll dis-
cover, trigger events are an excellent way of integrating business changes into 
your continuity plans as they happen.
Make sure trigger events are included in the business continuity policy. The 
responsibility for acting on trigger events should also be specifically stated in 
the job description or objectives for business continuity coordinators and the 
accountable managers. And it’s not for business continuity to identify the changes 
that trigger plan reviews; the department or division must identify them.
Tip
■
■
  Set a time limit on trigger events. For example, policy should state that a review must be 
initiated within 30 days of the business change.
When a planned activity leads to change, it’s easy to keep in mind your respon-
sibilities to revisit continuity plans. But often you’ll experience the creeping 
change that comes about through organic or compound growth. If volumes 
grow 10% a year, it won’t take long before the business outgrows its business 
continuity provisions. This sort of creeping change is less a matter for a trig-
ger event and more a matter of something that needs to be reviewed at least 
annually as part of the normal business reviews.
Maintain Your Business Continuity Plan
In addition to any reviews that are initiated as a consequence of a trigger 
event, schedule regular reviews of all the business continuity plans.
I’d recommend that these reviews be planned to follow from the business 
impact analysis, as the business impact analysis (BIA) will almost certainly iden-
tify changes that need to be incorporated into your plans. So, by doing them 
together, you can kill two birds with one stone.

Chapter 15 | Maintenance
194
I’d also recommend that the best timing for reviews is agreed upon through 
consultation with the business areas in question. I find it easiest to walk through 
the latest BIA and then discuss whether the business continuity plan is still 
appropriate based on how the BIA has changed from the previous year.
I also walk through the plan with the business continuity coordinator and 
ideally with the accountable manager to see if it’s still accurate, practical, and 
easily understood. I strongly advise that you don’t simply delegate this impor-
tant meeting to the business coordinator, as that person can often be blind to 
what’s actually in the plan and won’t always see gaps or weaknesses that will 
come out through a facilitated desk review.
Business Recovery Solution Maintenance
Through tests and regular business continuity plan reviews, you should be 
able to identify changes you need to make to keep the work area recovery 
solution current.
In addition, I’d recommend doing an annual review of the WAR arrangements. 
Look at the site, facilities, server rooms, telephony, and network connections 
and think about what change is likely over the next 3 years. Start to plan or at 
least debate the necessary upgrades.
With third-party arrangements, you always need to be mindful of the dura-
tion of the contract and any contractual break points, because if you need to 
change locations or have some other major change, you’ll want to align this 
with the break points in your contracts.
Maintain Your Information Technology 
Disaster Recovery Solution
As with WAR, DR should be change controlled, and anything that slips through 
the net should get swept up when you test.
Again like WAR, if you use a third party, think about how your business is 
changing and how you can manage this change most effectively within the 
constraints of the contract.
Maintain Your Crisis Management Plan
Your crisis management plans should be reviewed at least every quarter and 
new copies of the changed sections circulated. If you work in a larger organi-
zation, you’ll probably find that your crisis management team and key contacts 
will come and go, and if you wait much more than a few months to update this, 
the plan will look out of date and leave you exposed.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
195
As a general rule, I’d walk through all the documents that make up the cri-
sis management plan, paying special attention to the contacts, at least once  
a quarter.
Maintain Your Policies
You will probably have some rules in your organization about reviewing your 
policies. As guidance, I’d recommend reviewing the policy once every 2 years. 
As a rule, the policy should be quite static, although you may find that in the 
first few years it evolves quite quickly as you extend and refine it.
Tip
■
■
  Review your work area recovery plan at least annually, your crisis management plan at least 
quarterly, and your business continuity polices at least every 2 years.
Action Plan
Review the following questions before progressing and consider the 
recommendations:
Is DR included as part of the change management pro-
• 
cess? If not, then review your change process and make 
sure you have the basics in place.
Have you identified trigger events that, if they occur, 
• 
indicate that it’s time for some relevant maintenance 
activity?
Have you embedded the maintenance of all your business 
• 
continuity documents, policies, reports, tools, and solu-
tions into your business-as-usual processes?

Disaster
How to Respond When a Disaster Strikes
There are three decisive things about business survival: how you manage 
the events you face, how you make decisions, and how you monitor your 
responses.
This chapter explains command and control in a disaster and helps you to set 
up a crisis management team that will get you out of the tightest squeeze.
Identification and Notification
There’s no point in having a plan or a solution if you fail to notice that you 
have had an incident!
Nearly as bad as total ignorance is not picking up on an incident until it has 
become a full-scale disaster. With timely action, most incidents can be man-
aged without leading to a full-blown disaster. However, many seemingly minor 
incidents can develop into major problems that can ultimately destroy organi-
zations if people are not paying attention.
So, clearly you need to monitor minor incidents and make sure they don’t 
escalate into major incidents.

Chapter 16 | Manage a Disaster

Identifying Incidents
Incidents come in all shapes and sizes, and you can’t predict them all. Chances 
are that for every possible incident, there will be someone in your organiza-
tion who was aware of the underlying activity. For example, someone notices 
a leak in the water main in the basement on Monday, then forgets about it 
until Thursday, when the trickle becomes a torrent.
What we have to do is join up the eyes and ears of your organization and train 
people to look for the relevant signs.
Some areas, like IT and facilities, will probably be quite mature, with estab-
lished protocols, procedures, and so forth. This is good news because these 
are the two areas most likely to have major incidents that can lead you to 
invoke your recovery plans. However, other areas are often not as mature, 
such as in the production areas where business process failures are probably 
managed locally and in isolation.
In that case, I’d recommend the following steps:
1.	 Identify what incident processes already exist.
2.	 Establish a consistent way of assessing the impact and 
rating it. For example, the loss of a data center, building, 
or critical supplier would be category 1, loss of a major 
system would be category 2, loss of minor system would 
be category 3, etc.
3.	 Set some trigger points for the areas that are manag-
ing localized events. The trigger points indicate when you 
must notify the business continuity manager or incident 
manager that an event has occurred. For example, you 
might decide that the designated person should be noti-
fied immediately in person if a category 1 incident occurs. 
If a category 2 incident occurs, you notify by e-mail, and 
so forth.
If you identify an incident that is critical enough to require recovery, then initi-
ate the recovery steps. Don’t wait for approval or second opinions. Of course, 
you must make this a matter of policy or have preagreement that you have 
authority to respond in this fashion.
You also need to empower those people who will be in a position of response 
so they too can act as required.
Having put in place processes, triggers, policies, and associated authority, all 
that remains is to train the people. Hence my suggestion is that you exercise, 
exercise, exercise—and make sure you involve management so there are no 
surprises, there’s no lost time, and there are no repercussions afterward.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
201
Most invocation decisions don’t have an immediate effect and are quickly 
reversible. However, it’s worth understanding the impact of each step so you 
can include some checkpoints or gateways if you feel the need.
Tip
■
■
  If an incident is critical enough to require recovery, initiate the recovery steps immediately. 
Don’t wait for approval or ask for the opinion of others. Move. Now. Of course, your policy should have 
permitted you to act when necessary without oversight.
Monitoring Incidents
Now, assuming that you have the basic notification process in place, the next 
step is to monitor progress and assess whether the incident is being managed 
effectively or requires escalation.
If it becomes clear that the incident is not being managed effectively or plans 
are not having the desired impact, escalate the incident to higher authorities 
to ensure action is taken. Don’t delay; escalate as soon as you see a lack of 
control or a lack of progress.
I can’t emphasize this enough. Time is like sand: once it slips through your fin-
gers it’s gone forever. When it comes to recovery, you have a fixed time that it 
takes to recover, and there’s probably very little time for delay, so don’t!
Triage
Just as in a hospital’s accident and emergency department, you have to sort 
out the life-threatening incidents from the minor irritations. Just as in an 
emergency room, you have to do it quickly. Then focus on the life-and-death 
situations first before attending to the walking wounded.
From a business incident point of view, rather than waiting for someone like 
you to assess the incident, you want the business to self-assess the incident 
as it occurs. It’s a bit like patients assessing whether they need to go to the 
emergency room or stay at home and take an aspirin.
This should be an area of focus for your education and awareness program. 
It should be a key focus for all people who are in a position of being first 
responders, including those likely to spot emerging issues or who are the first 
to deal with them.
The first thing you need to do is identify the “no-brainers.” Security should 
never phone you up to say, “A helicopter just hit the roof. What should we 
do?” They should start the plan rolling first and make people aware as the plan 
or crisis management process dictates.

Chapter 16 | Manage a Disaster
202
A little frivolous perhaps, but you get the point. You should have identified the 
no-brainers like this as defined by the few possible outcomes and have clear 
instructions for all responders.
Just as with risk analysis, focus on outcomes and not possible causes. So, your 
security guard is responding to the outcome that the office block is not avail-
able, thus, he has invoked the building recovery plan.
Focusing on outcomes makes it much simpler as you reduce these down to 
between five and seven possible outcomes, and as students of psychology will 
tell you, seven is a good number of things as it corresponds to the amount of 
items an average person can remember. Note: Don’t rely on people’s memory; 
make sure it’s all documented.
Tip
■
■
  When a disaster strikes, don’t give any thought to causes. There will be plenty of time later 
to do that. Instead, focus on managing the outcomes of the disaster. “The building is on fire? We must 
get people out immediately, and then invoke WAR.”
Command and Control
Once the crisis response is in action, you should quickly establish a command-
and-control structure.
Generally, this is the domain of the crisis management team and its process.
Unlike normal business operations, when in crisis mode, there should be a 
more rigid command-and-control structure, with short lines of communica-
tion, near real-time flow of information, and rapid decision making.
However, you should make sure all the individuals with recovery roles are 
empowered to act within their responsibilities. There should be some bound-
aries around their autonomy in that:
They shouldn’t start until given clear instruction or they 
• 
can clearly establish that it’s okay to begin.
They should report progress and issues and seek direction 
• 
when issues arise if they are material and when questions are 
delaying their progress or risk the quality of the outcome.
To maximize command-and-control efficiency, meetings should be brief. They 
should be managed by the leader at that level in the command hierarchy. Crisis 
meetings should follow a preagreed-upon agenda along the lines of:
New developments or changes in context
• 
Issues
• 

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
203
Progress against an agreed-upon action plan
• 
Next steps
• 
Time of next meeting or any other business
• 
The leader should hold court and may want to go around the room (or call 
if it’s a virtual meeting) and get each member to provide an update on each 
topic. I find focusing on one area at a time works best when each member of 
the team runs through the agenda as it applies to their area. Keep them to a 
couple of minutes each.
You need to be disciplined and limit people’s time and keep them focused on 
things that are salient to the group as a whole. Some people forget this and 
start recounting trivia.
If people can’t communicate salient information quickly, then they lack one of 
the most important skills for members of a crisis management team: brevity!
You should have scribes and keep the salient information visible at all times. I 
like to use whiteboards arranged so that everyone in the room can see them. 
I’d recommend keeping up-to-date event, issues, actions, and risk logs in elec-
tronic form so they can be reviewed by anyone not in the room.
Then, as soon as you’ve gone around the room with all the members, established 
the facts, and decided on the next steps, you should immediately conclude the 
meeting to let people get on with their tasks and meet again as agreed.
This meeting will be repeated at the next lower level of the hierarchy, where 
each crisis team member convenes his or her respective teams and briefs 
them on what was decided and initiates the next steps in the recovery for 
their area. Again, this should be brief with a focus on cascading the salient 
information to the team, capturing feedback, and getting everyone focused on 
the immediate priorities.
The Leader’s Job
When running the crisis meetings, the leader should direct things. It’s impor-
tant to maintain momentum, focusing on the agenda while making sure balance 
is maintained. The leader will find it useful to work through the whiteboards 
or whatever was used to record events, issues, and actions. The leader should 
ask for specific updates if he or she hasn’t heard enough about a particular 
topic, and, if necessary, detail someone to investigate it further.
The crisis leader needs to be constantly assessing whether the plan is pro-
gressing, whether prescribed actions are working, and, if not, what should be 
done to bring the recovery back on plan. The leader also needs to review 
what people are actually doing and weigh reality against what they should be 

Chapter 16 | Manage a Disaster
204
doing. In other words, evaluating “what the plan says they should be doing” 
vs. “what they are doing.” Where there are gaps between plans and reality, 
the leader needs to understand why and be assured that it’s justified and 
appropriate.
Leaders need to look at the team and make sure they are giving people the 
right direction and support. It is of no value to just shout at people—leaders 
have to be sure people understand and are in a good frame of mind to get 
the job done.
In a crisis situation, it’s essential that the crisis leader demonstrates calmness 
and a positive focus. The leader needs to redirect people away from the issues 
(past) and channel them toward positive action (present). Everyone needs to 
be clear about who’s in charge and remain confident that things will work out.
Tip
■
■
  In a midst of a crisis, help people focus on taking positive action in the present, rather than 
rehashing issues related to the past.
Records
You should provide all your recovery teams, including the crisis management 
team, with templates for event, issues, actions, and risk logs. However, in a cri-
sis it’s not just about having a record of these things; the critical thing is that 
everyone can see them.
I’ve been in too many exercises where the scribe simply keys everything into 
a computer. They have a perfect and instant record, but it’s quite useless 
because nobody else can see it.
It is far better to record all the salient facts on whiteboards that everyone in 
the room can see.
The scribe can easily type these notes up as soon as the meeting concludes 
or even after the incident.
Postmortem
Once the incident is resolved, it’s important that the key people review:
The identification of the incident
• 
Incident escalation
• 
Invocation of the plans
• 
Effectiveness of the plans
• 

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
205
Adherence to the plans, processes, and controls
• 
Quality of the meetings
• 
Communication
• 
Performance of key areas and personnel
• 
Records, scribing, and administrative support
• 
Issues and risks
• 
Return to normal operations
• 
Closure of the incident
• 
The postmortem meeting should be formal and result in an agreed-upon 
action plan with clear ownership and target dates.
Last but not least, the action plan as a whole must be owned; someone must 
make sure that it has been completed.
It’s normally the business continuity manager who will track progress against 
the actions and monitor risks. However, it should be a far more senior manager 
who owns the overall plan and is ultimately responsible for its completion.
Responding to Different Scenarios
We have covered the generic elements of managing an event, and in your 
preparation you should have considered a range of scenarios and ideally prac-
ticed your responses with these in mind.
Now it’s time to dive a little deeper into some of the most likely scenarios 
you might face.
Responding to Loss of Technology
Technology failure—and the loss of IT systems in particular—is one of the 
most likely events that can lead to disaster.
With luck, before disaster strikes you will have had time to identify your most 
critical services, prepare recovery strategies, and worked out the correct 
order to recover them. Having done all that, you should have the documenta-
tion ready and trained all the staff who need to be involved in a recovery (see 
Chapter 5 for a full explanation from a systems perspective).
With technology, time is often critical. In many cases, the difference between 
the maximum tolerable period of disruption (MTPD) and how long it will 
actually take to recover the system is quite small. This means that, in practice, 

Chapter 16 | Manage a Disaster
206
there’s little time for delays when making the decision to invoke, getting staff 
in a position to undertake the recovery, addressing issues and problems that 
may emerge, among others.
So act quickly. If you’re unsure, initiate the recovery. You can always stand 
down later.
A particular mistake you must avoid is waiting until all available options have 
been exhausted. By this I mean trying to fix it. It’s easy to keep trying one 
more thing or to wait a few more minutes.
Instead, think about DR and fixing the problem as parallel activities. Initiate 
your DR while you’re still trying to fix the problems. That way you won’t lose 
time, and then if you do exhaust all the possibilities for recovery, your DR 
will be well under way. Also, you may find that DR gets to a point where it’s 
ready while you’re still working on the fix, which will give you another option 
to consider.
You also need to think slightly differently if your DR solution is delivered via a 
third party. If it is, you want to avoid being beaten to any shared resources by 
another business that needs to invoke.
Bear in mind that most third-party suppliers allow you to put them on standby 
for securing your systems. They start clearing the site down to make it ready 
for you, which normally takes up to 4 hours and involves freeing up any 
resources that are currently being used for testing by other DR customers.
There’s normally a cost associated with this, and the cost will be incurred 
regardless of whether you finally decide to invoke. There will also probably be 
a daily usage charge. Hence, to be sure you can act quickly, you need to have 
already secured the authority. You really don’t want to be wasting time trying 
to find someone who can approve the expenditure at three in the morning—
or indeed at any time—because time is slipping through your fingers and you 
will not be able to recover it.
When recovering your systems, you have to allow some time to test them 
before unleashing them on the users. The last thing you want to do is bring up 
the wrong system, or wrong data, or corrupt the live data.
Testing shouldn’t take long and should have been a consideration when prepar-
ing your recovery plan. It should be documented in the plan, and you should 
make sure you get suitable approval before letting users on. This is good prac-
tice and also protects your critical systems.
If you don’t have a recovery strategy, you will need to start from scratch, 
procure some hardware, find somewhere to put it that has appropriate envi-
ronmental support, build the operating systems, build the applications, and 
restore the data.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
207
The odds are against recovering if you’re not prepared. Trying to recover your IT 
without DR is like planning your retirement by buying lottery tickets each week.
Even if you could get something up and running, how much data will you 
have lost? If you don’t have a decent backup strategy, at best it could be days 
or weeks of data lost and at worst it could be all your data and proprietary 
software too!
I’d suggest that if you fail to recover your major systems, then in a matter of 
weeks, rather than months, your business will fail.
Tip
■
■
  No matter what it takes, have an IT disaster recovery plan in place. If you fail to recover your 
major systems because you did not plan, the penalty could be the worst imaginable—failure of the 
business itself.
Responding to a Loss of a Building
Assuming you have some strategy for dealing with the loss of a critical build-
ing and you have prepared and rehearsed the plans, it should be a relatively 
smooth process to maintain operations without the building in question.
Just as for IT DR, invoking your building recovery is time critical for exactly 
the same reasons. You have a limited amount of spare time between how long 
it actually takes and how long before it’s needed.
Just as for DR, you also need to think slightly differently where your recovery 
solution is delivered via a third-party provider. If it is, you want to avoid the 
possibility of being beaten to it by another business that also needs to invoke.
Again, most WAR suppliers allow you to put them on standby, allowing you 
to secure your positions. They start getting the site ready for you in case you 
need it.
Like for DR, there’s normally a cost associated with placing the supplier on 
standby, and this cost will be incurred regardless of whether you finally decide 
to invoke. There will also be a daily usage charge that is levied for every single 
day you make use of the facility.
To ensure that you can act quickly, make sure that you secure the authority 
to invoke in advance.
If you don’t have a recovery solution in place, you will need to act quickly, 
secure what facilities you can, mobilize your IT staff, and work like dogs. Not 
wanting to be the voice of doom, but if you’re not prepared, the odds are not 
good. Basically, the majority of organizations that fail to recover following a 
major incident tend to go out of business in a relatively short time!

Chapter 16 | Manage a Disaster
208
The good news is that if you manage an effective recovery, then the statistics 
demonstrate that you will most likely see an increase in shareholder value.
Even for less critical activities, you will sooner or later need to find some-
where or some way to get them done.
I deal with WAR and other strategies fully in Chapter 6.
Responding to a Denial of Access to a Building
More likely than the scenario in which you lose your building is the one where 
you find that your staff is not allowed into their place of work. This is most 
often the result of either a false alarm, like a defective fire alarm, or because 
of a localized event like a power failure.
In the majority of cases, these events are resolved quickly. So, it’s important 
you don’t let your staff stray off too far, as you’ll want to be able to bring them 
back to work as quickly as possible.
To do this you need to have:
Marshaling points
• 
Evacuation plans
• 
Trained marshals
• 
Simple lines of communication
• 
Staff that knows what to do and where to go
• 
Marshaling Points
Marshaling points are prearranged places where staff are directed to meet 
if the building is evacuated. Ideally, they should be near to your building, but 
far enough away if the situation was dangerous and an exclusion zone was 
imposed. Example: you have a bomb threat.
You may approach this in one of two ways:
Have a primary marshaling point and a secondary one 
• 
that you can fall back on if there’s an exclusion zone. For 
example, the square opposite your building might be a 
primary marshaling point, and a park 800 yards away 
could be your secondary marshaling point.
Select a single marshaling point that would be outside the 
• 
likely exclusion zone for your building. Check with your 
emergency services for advice on this as it varies from 
place to place, but 250 yards is normally recommended.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
209
A word of warning: you need to coordinate your plans with the surrounding 
offices. If the square opposite has room for 500 people, but there are ten 
buildings that all assume they will assemble their combined 5,000 staff there, 
you will have a major problem.
In general it’s a good idea to work closely with your peers in other companies 
and locations. Share ideas, share information, and build relationships so you 
can offer one another support in a crisis. Plus, you can learn a lot from how 
others manage DR.
Evacuation Plan
Just like your broader business continuity planning, you need to consider the 
likely outcomes of having to evacuate. Then you should prepare a plan that 
can cater to what is likely to happen.
The plan must be simple, clear, and intuitive, so that everyone can understand 
it, remember it, and use it when required.
The plan should set out:
Where staff will assemble
• 
How to evacuate the building
• 
How to account for staff
• 
How to establish if it’s safe to return into the building
• 
How to communicate to staff
• 
Trained Marshals
To make the evacuation safe and effective, you need trained marshals who will 
guide people from the building, make sure everyone gets out, perform a roll 
call, provide information to those coordinating the event, and cascade infor-
mation back to the staff.
Marshals need basic training on the drill and likely scenarios. This should be 
supported by simple instructions and copies of the relevant plans.
You can do this by having them participate in actual drills. Ideally, they should 
observe another marshal the first time, then take on the role in subsequent 
drills. I’d also recommend having one-off training as part of the induction of 
new marshals, as well as periodic refresher courses.
It doesn’t really matter how you do it. What matters is that these staff know 
what they have to do and will perform well if a situation arises.

Chapter 16 | Manage a Disaster
210
Simple Lines of Communication
If you are to keep control of the situation, you will need to keep control of 
your staff. This is aided by having some basics rules, such as “Staff are to report 
to the muster points and await further instructions.” Once you get staff at the 
muster point, it’s a good idea to keep them apprised of what has happened. 
For example, “This is just a drill and we will be going back in soon.”
You should think in advance of the best way to repopulate the building after 
an evacuation. It’s a good idea to call people back in phases rather than just 
having everyone swamp the building in one instant.
To do this, you need to be able to get the message out to each muster point 
and get people to come back in the order you want. Maybe focus on getting 
critical staff back in first, like your call center operators and computer opera-
tors. Or maybe you bring the people back in an order that maximizes the 
smooth flow of people coming in, such as top floors first.
To do this, you’ll need good lines of communication and good plans that cover 
who is where and who you should prioritize for a return to work.
You might find that it helps to arrange the muster points so that those most 
critical are nearest to the entrance.
Clearly, it’s a good idea to provide the marshals who are at the muster points 
with walkie-talkies or runners so they can communicate with whomever is 
controlling the incident.
If the event is not a false alarm, and people have been stood down to wait 
for directions or sent home for the day, you will still need to contact people 
quickly. You will therefore have to invoke your call cascade plans and provide 
news to staff information lines.
The information lines can be used to post generic information about the 
incident and should not contain anything that is commercially sensitive as you 
have limited control about who can access this type of information.
Ideally, you might have the benefit of an automated call notification system, 
which will send any message you like to select groups of employees using 
many different means. It will try the home phone number, work mobile num-
ber, personal mobile, Blackberry, spouse’s number, among others.
Staff Awareness
It’s not just about training your crisis management team and the marshals. It’s 
almost as important that every staff member knows where to go, what to do 
when they get there, what to expect, how to find out information, and what 
not to do.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
211
Ideally, this should be covered in everyone’s company induction. Every mem-
ber of staff should have basic instructions sent to them that cover the evacu-
ation drill, muster points, the basics of the crisis management plan, and key 
contacts.
Responding to the Loss of Key Staff
Loss of key staff covers all the things that can lead to a situation where key 
staff are unable to attend the place of work.
Increasingly, the focus of business continuity plans is the pandemic-type scenario 
where your staff stay away from your office in large numbers.
This is not unique to a pandemic; it could be due to more mundane things like 
bad weather, strikes, or school closures. In fact, these scenarios are more likely 
than a pandemic, which happens about once every 30 or 40 years. The differ-
ence with a pandemic is the duration and moral aspects of the scenario.
Think Skills and Tasks, Not Functions
Loss of key staff is a subtle and difficult scenario to deal with, and it can 
require considerable extra work to model the impact. Unlike most other 
scenarios, where you are thinking and acting at a function level—for example, 
“Facilities”—with this scenario, you need to consider individual tasks and the 
skills needed to complete them (e.g., “Maintaining the power supply.”).
The first step is to identify key activities and the skills needed to do them. 
Then you need to look at where the biggest exposures are.
In this context, the biggest exposures are those things that depend on a single 
person, and then there are those that only a few people can do.
A big problem with this, and something you need to avoid, is being lulled by 
statistics. You might assume that 50% of your staff will be unavailable for the 
peak period of disruption, but this 50% will rarely be distributed evenly. So, 
you might have everyone in from the canteen but none of them can undertake 
the mandatory obligations of your company.

HEARTS AND MINDS
I used to work with a DR manager who was always keen to point out that if something 
happened that put his family at risk, he’d put them first. His frankness kept me real, as 
it’s all too easy to get caught up in the abstractness of plans. At the end of the day, it all 
comes down to people and in particular what people are thinking.
So, there’s a school of thought that says you need to change what people think about 
coming to work. You need to give them assurances that work is actually not a dangerous 
place to go. Implementing a rigorous hygiene cleaning routine can be very effective and 
can provide other tangible benefits.
During the SARS outbreak, Barclays Capital introduced new cleaning procedures for 
their offices in Southeast Asia that included regular wiping down of all common surfaces. 
As a result, they saw a significant reduction in days lost from sickness that more than 
compensated for the additional cleaning costs.
You need to consider giving your staff access to better care as well. Many organizations 
offer their staff access to antiviral medicines, health screening, counseling, and 
support. You also need to make sure that staff get accurate information and not just the 
sensational scare stories from the media.
You need to consider the types of concerns your staff will have that will stop them from 
coming to work. Could it be public transport? You could put critical staff up in hotels, 
arrange taxis, or staff buses.
Split-Site Strategy
Some businesses advocate adopting a split-site strategy in certain situations. 
Take, for example, a pandemic. The idea is that you run your production and 
recovery site in parallel and split your people between the two sites in the 
hope of isolating them and offering staff a choice of locations.
In practice, I wouldn’t recommend split site for such scenarios, because it adds 
complexity, and I don’t believe it mitigates the risk of infection. Your staff will 
probably pick up the infection from their children or friends and the distribu-
tion of infection will be consistent regardless of location.
However, what split-site working will do is stretch your already stretched 
resources because you’ll need to support two locations rather than just one!
Responding to the Loss of a Supplier
This covers all situations where a supplier is unable to provide critical 
services, products, or resources.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
213
In recent years there has been a massive shift, especially among large corpora-
tions, where many of the traditional business functions have been outsourced. 
In many organizations, it is only those core activities that make that organiza-
tion unique that are still done in house by their own staff.
Now the upside of outsourcing is that it brings greater focus to an organiza-
tion and also brings better processes, know how, and economies of scale to 
areas like personnel, finance, catering, and facilities—things that an organiza-
tion may not currently be all that good at.
However, it also brings a risk! So keep in mind that, although outsourced pro-
cesses might not be core to your business, if these functions fail, then in some 
cases the whole organization can fail.
In short you need to understand your dependencies on suppliers. Where 
there’s a need to recover or protect a function, you need to make that clear in 
your negotiations. It needs to be documented in the contract and you need to 
test it or see solid evidence that the supplier can meet its obligations to you.
You also need to keep a close eye on your suppliers. If they fail, you must act 
to secure an alternative supplier or, if at all possible, insource it.
Action Plan
Before moving on, reflect on the following questions and recommendations:
1.	 Are incidents in your organization effectively identified, 
monitored, and escalated? If not, then you’ll need to 
tackle this gap head on. Otherwise, there’s a real chance 
that all your work on business continuity is a waste. You 
won’t invoke your plans at the right time, if at all.
2.	 Are incidents managed consistently across the organiza-
tion? If not, then you’ll need to bring some order either 
by standardizing processes or terminology or by having 
a mechanism that reconciles any discrepancies (i.e., one 
that recognizes that an incident IT may call a “critical 1 
incident” is the same as what facilities call an “A status 
event”).
3.	 Is there an effective command-and-control structure and 
supporting processes for dealing with disasters?
4.	 Where you have different business units in the same loca-
tion, is the recovery of the location integrated? You may 
need to think about having an overarching plan that the 
crisis team will use to dictate the order of recovery for 
different functions.

Chapter 16 | Manage a Disaster
214
5.	 Are all the key business lines included within your com-
mand-and-control structure? If not, then you’ll need to 
make sure all business lines are represented in the com-
mand-and-control structure. If you have finance, IT, HR, 
and operations all in the same building, for example, they 
should all be represented at a management level, included 
in salient communications, and prioritized based on the 
immediate business need.
6.	 Do you have evacuation plans and marshaling points for 
all locations? If not, then you’ll need to assess the need 
for marshaling points and decide on practical locations 
and embed this in your local processes.
7.	 Do you have trained marshals in all locations? If not, then 
you’ll need to select and train marshals.
8.	 Does your staff know what to do if they get evacuated or 
can’t get to work? If not, then you have a clear focus for 
your education and awareness initiatives.
9.	 Is your incident response set up to deal with incidents 
outside the traditional boundaries of your organization? 
In other words, would you be notified of a material sup-
plier failure? If not, then you need to work with these sup-
pliers to make sure your incident management processes 
integrate with theirs and that you are suitably notified  
of events.

Post Event
Return to Normal Operations
Getting your business back to “business as usual” can be a challenge. This 
chapter sets out what you need to do after you have invoked IT DR and how 
to minimize the risks. The approach also works for how to return to business 
as usual after invoking WAR.
Understanding the Different Planning 
Scenarios
There are a number of different scenarios that apply to a return to normal 
operations. They depend on the level of damage, the recovery architecture 
you’ve employed, and your attitude toward risk.
Production Is Still Intact
If you are lucky and the production site is intact, then reverting to production 
could be quite simple.
For systems, this is made simpler if you are able to replicate all new work 
completed in the DR location directly back to the normal production envi-
ronment. Unfortunately, some DR designs only support replication in one 
direction. Consequently, you will need to reconfigure the DR environment to 
enable the recovery.
In many cases this is simply a matter of reversing the steps or even repeating 
the steps you originally took to invoke DR with some minor changes.
17
C H A P T E R 

Chapter 17 | Post Event
216
Production Is Without Replication or Is Unable to 
Return “Home”
If you have production but either don’t have replication or it is not viable to 
return to the original production site or systems, then you are going to have 
to plan to get the latest data and software loaded back at the new production 
location, close down DR, and bring up production with all networks directing 
traffic to the right location.
This may mean copying data to tape, or it may mean physically applying soft-
ware changes and reconfiguring computers and networks. The details can vary, 
but the need for manual intervention is guaranteed, along with the inherent 
risks. In the worst case, you will need to source a new site and hardware, which 
will not only engender significant risks but will also lead to lengthy delays.
Consider the Ongoing Risks
The post-DR risks to consider are:
Loss of data
• 
Corruption of data
• 
Security breaches
• 
Extended outages if the switching from DR back to 
• 
production overruns
You need to do a risk assessment as part of your plan to switch back, making 
sure that you cover each of these risks.
Take the Right Approach to Mitigate Risks
There are a variety of approaches to mitigate risks and get back to normal, 
which include the following:
• 
Parallel running. Get production and DR data synchronized 
and run both sites in parallel for a while until you are sure 
that it is okay to switch fully back. Parallel running can be 
done using batch processes to reprocess live transaction 
against the secondary site’s databases.
• 
Close down, start up. This involves performing an orderly 
close down, normally at the end of the business day. You 
may complete all the normal batch work. Then restore the 
data in the target site before bringing the system up there.

Disaster Recovery, Crisis Response, and Business Continuity
217
• 
New build. You may have to build the systems, infrastruc-
ture, and data bases from scratch. This could be the result 
of having to find a new site, replacing hardware, or just 
the need to reintegrate changes that have been made 
since the system switched to run from the DR location. 
It can be very time-consuming and will involve extensive 
testing. There is significant risk of errors being made or 
issues emerging.
• 
Lift and drop. You may decide to physically take the equip-
ment that is running in DR and ship it to the production 
site. This involves all the physical risks that are associated 
with the movement of equipment.
Planning the Return to Normal
Naturally, it will be easier to return to normal if you have planned for it in 
advance. In the majority of cases, the return-to-normal operations plan will 
be a reworking of the DR plan. Put simply, you take the plan for invoking DR 
and reverse it.
I recommend that you give this plenty of consideration when you are weighing 
your recovery strategy. Ask yourself, “How will we return to normal opera-
tions if either the production site is available again or the site is lost and a new 
site has to be sourced?” This is an important question that tests the viability 
of your options before you spend money developing it.
You should aim to adopt a strategy that lends itself to return to normal opera-
tions. This might sound obvious, but I can’t tell you how often I’ve come across 
both WAR and DR solutions that would be almost impossible to revert—
where the decision to invoke them in the first place is actually as painful as 
doing nothing.
As a basic outline, the plan should cover:
How you going to revert operations. What are the 
• 
alternatives? Why are you choosing this approach? This 
shouldn’t be the length of War and Peace, but a brief 
overview to demonstrate the general rationale that has 
been applied.
The specific actions you’ll take.
• 
How you will test the action plan (both before and after 
• 
the switch is completed).

Chapter 17 | Post Event
218
How you can stop the switch if you encounter issues. 
• 
Identify any points of no return or major milestones 
where the mechanism for reverting the process changes.
The risks and how you will manage them.
• 
How you will manage the process, escalate issues, and 
• 
report progress.
When the switch will be done. Again provide some 
• 
rationale (e.g., bank holiday weekend as it provide some 
contingency time if issues are encountered).
Who will approve the plan.
• 
Once you have the plan, you need to get formal approval from the account-
able managers. This will partly be dictated by your organization’s change pro-
cess and partly by who owns the overall risks and business services that are 
affected.
Tip
■
■
  If you can, work your WAR or DR plan such that returning to normal is simply reversing the 
steps in it. That will make your life much easier and the return less prone to glitches.
Maintaining Command and Control
Returning to normal operations is normally a time-critical and high-risk activity.  
It’s not something I’d recommend delegating to data center operations or 
some other IT team.
You need to monitor progress closely and track any slippages to assess their 
overall potential to impact the recovery timescales. You’ll also need to moni-
tor any slippages and compare them with the possible reversion points. In 
particular, be aware of those for which you can’t back out of the switch and 
bring production back up in DR without incurring an outage.
Depending on the risk and profile of the change, I recommend having manage-
ment presence to oversee the switch and escalate any issues.

Action Plan
Reflect on the following questions and associated recommendations:
1.	 Do you know how you’ll return to normal operations for 
each of the most likely scenarios? Is what you are plan-
ning actually the most sensible approach? Will it work? If 
not, then think about the strategies you’d employ using 
walkthroughs of your plans for the likely scenarios; assess 
the risks and include return-to-normal operations in your 
ongoing recovery testing.
2.	 Have you assessed the risks of having to return to normal 
operations? If not, then you’d better look at the options 
and assess the related risks.
3.	 Do you have a basic plan for returning to operations 
or could you just reverse the existing continuity plans? 
Think about what level of planning is appropriate and pull 
it together before it’s too late.

Criticality Levels
The following table is an example of criticality levels. The point is to deter-
mine when you absolutely must get an operation, process, or infrastructure 
back up and running, and then assign it a criticality level. If you’re running a 
global finance operation, for example, you would probably need to assign 
payments processing a level of 0 or 1. HR systems, on the other hand, might 
rate a 4 or 5.
Only you know what makes sense for your company. You may decide to have 
more or have different descriptions or levels. It’s the principle that matters; 
the exact implementation is irrelevant as long as it’s consistent within your 
organization and represents a sensible way of breaking requirements up.

Roles and 
Responsibility 
Matrix
The following matrix—called RACI, which stands for Responsible, Accountable, 
Consulted, and Informed—sets out the high-level tasks that need to be under-
taken in creating and sustaining a business continuity program. It’s a very useful 
tool for making sure that the right things are planned with good engagement 
and communication.
It’s not meant to be a flow chart, but it nevertheless provides a good basic tool 
with which to audit your program.
Key to Activity
Here’s how each label is defined:
Responsible (R): The people, person, or team responsible for 
doing the activity.
Accountable (A): The person or body accountable for the activ-
ity being done. This includes making resources available, overseeing 
quality, and balancing the activity with other business priorities.
Consulted (C): The people, person, or team consulted as part of 
the process. These are the people who will help establish the who, 
what, why, where, when, and how of the activity.
Informed (I): The people, person, or team that is kept informed 
about the process.

Escalation Process
On identifying an incident or the potential for one, the initial responders 
should escalate to the BCM manager, who will monitor the incident and esca-
late to the crisis leader, who, with the business continuity manager, will decide 
if the crisis management team needs to be convened.

Critical Activities List	
Critical activities will of course vary from business to business. For example, 
if you’re in the grocery business and your freezers fail, you need to move the 
goods fast—with an RTO of maybe an hour or less. An information-based 
business would have an entirely different set of priorities.

Business 
Impact Analysis 
Questionnaire
The BIA questionnaire is part of the BIA process, which establishes what is 
critical to business survival and how that will translate into recovery priorities 
or requirements. Chapter 3 describes more on the process. Note that this is 
a “short-form” version of a BIA questionnaire.

Appendix I | Business Impact Analysis Questionnaire
266
For the purposes of this BIA, we have defined a “significant” impact as:
The potential loss of $1million in profits
• 
Fines or compensation in excess of $500,000
• 
A private warning from a lead regulator
• 
A serious breach of industry rules
• 
A prominent negative article in a leading media outlet
• 
The potential permanent loss of one or more high-profile 
• 
clients
Litigation resulting in loss of reputation, fines, or lengthy 
• 
legal proceedings
Note
■
■
  You will need to establish your own criteria for a significant impact. It’s probable that you 
will need to set much lower thresholds for potential loss and introduce some totally new aspects that 
are unique or relevant to your industry.
2. Critical Activities
List your function’s activities or processes. When listing the functions, think 
about when would be the worst possible time in the business cycle (e.g., 
volatile markets, end of accounting period, one hour before a specific dead-
line, etc.) for a disruption to normal operations. Assuming a disruption at the 
worst possible time in the business cycle, how long would it be before the 
“significant” impact threshold is breached? If you need to, add more functions 
add rows as required.

For each of your activities or processes, are there any upstream activities 
or processes on which you depend? There may be more than one for any of 
them. If the upstream activity or process was disrupted, how long would it be 
before your activity or process experienced a “significant” disruption?

List systems each time they are needed if they are used to support different 
activities or processes. Assuming a system’s disruption at the worst possible 
time in the business cycle, how long would it be before the “significant” 
impact threshold is breached? Likewise, working back from the point in 
time when the outage occurred, how much data could you afford to lose? In

other words, how much time could you leave between backups of the data? 
To answer this, think about how you would rekey information, if this were  
possible. Make allowances for the viability of rekeying data if you are operating in 
recovery and think about the point in time when any backlog would become 
overwhelming.

Identify any manual workarounds that could be used to delay the breach of 
the “significant” impact threshold and how long they could be used before 
catching up would be close to impossible. What strategies could you employ 
while you wait for your systems, people, or processes to be restored? A good 
example might be to switch all inbound calls to another office and stop all 
outbound calls until the recovery is completed.

Management 
Standards
As mentioned in Chapter 1, standards have been devised to help organi-
zations perform important activities in a consistent and high-quality way. 
They also help different organizations work together. There are country 
and international standards, both governed by a group of bodies that work 
together to promote better working practices and better working relation-
ships. Here’s a rundown of the standards relating to business continuity 
management.

desire to build resilience and an effective response to 
interruptions.
SS 507: Singapore Standard for 
Business Continuity/Disaster 
Recovery (BC/DR) Service 
Providers (2004)
Country: Singapore
SS 507 provides a basis to certify and differentiate the BC/
DR service providers. SS 507 helps organizations to select 
service providers and provides quality assurance.
SS 507 also establishes industry best practices to mitigate 
outsourcing risks.
SS 507 is applicable to BC/DR service providers who 
wish to get certified under the standard as well as BC/DR 
service providers or other organizations who can use the 
standard as a reference document.

Comments
SI 24001: Security and 
Continuity Management 
Systems (2007)
SI 24001 is a framework that addresses emergency 
preparedness. SI 24001 incorporates risk and threat analysis 
as the basis for preparation of a management program.
The standard is based on the assumption that a security 
event cannot be categorically prevented. Therefore, it 
contains a requirement to prepare plans for response and 
recovery in order to minimize the harm to the organization 
and its stakeholders.
Applies to any organization that wishes to protect itself 
from the impact of a disruptive event.
White Paper on Strengthening 
the Resilience of US Financial 
System (2002)
Advises larger financial institutions on steps necessary to 
protect the financial system.
The paper presents three new business continuity 
objectives:
Rapid recovery of critical operations following a wide-
• 
scale disruption
Rapid recovery following loss of staff
• 
High level of confidence that internal and external 
• 
continuity arrangements are effective
The paper puts forward recommended objectives. However, 
the guidance is generally viewed as mandatory by the wider 
financial service industry in the United States.
The paper targets all US institutions that are providing 
financial services, especially those deemed “critical” by the 
agencies. The requirements do not, however, apply to the 
recovery of trading operations or retail financial services.

Severity Levels
As mentioned in Chapter 1, if criticality levels provide a measure of how 
important something is to the business, severity levels tell us how significant 
events are. The following table is an example of severity levels. You may decide 
to list more or have different criteria or names. It’s the principle that matters; 
the exact implementation is irrelevant as long as it’s consistent within your 
organization and represents a sensible way of breaking incidents up.
Severity
Description
Critical
Significant risk to the continued operation of the whole enterprise
Severe
Significant risk to the continued operation of a business division or 
geographic region
Major
Risk to the continued operation of a major function, system, or key location
Significant
Risk to the continued operation of a secondary site, function, or system
Minor
Risk to the continued operation of a team, minor process, or system
Noncritical
Risk to noncritical activities, systems, or individuals

Mapping 
Severity Levels 
to Criticalities
As mentioned in Appendix K, if criticality levels provide a measure of how 
important something is to the business, severity levels tell us how significant 
events are. This table shows how the two interact. RTO, you will recall, 
stands for recovery time objective. Chapter 1 provides more on criticality 
and severity.
Severity
Criticality
Critical
0–2 which equates to an RTO <4 hours
Severe
0–2 which equates to an RTO <4 hours
Major
2–4 which equates to an RTO <24 hours
Significant
4–5 which equates to an RTO <48 hours
Minor
5–6 which equates to an RTO <1 week
Noncritical
7–8 which equates to an RTO >1 week

Acknowledgments
I would like to thank a few people. First, I have to thank my wife, Janet—for 
her patience—and my three children, Libby, Freya, and Ben, who brought me 
the happiness that comes from giving and not getting. Thanks also to my dad, 
Doug, for making me a better person and my father-in-law, John, for being 
himself and for always being there even though he’s in Turkey. Special thanks 
go to Jeff Olson at Apress for finding me, having faith and patience in me, and 
bringing much needed style and rigor to the text.
Finally, I’d like to thank all the colleagues and friends who have helped with 
their council, insight, wise words, criticism, innovation, and good practice 
over the years, in particular: Kamlesh Parmar, Ian Francis, Paul Cowan,
