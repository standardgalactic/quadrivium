PREFACE
By enrolling in this self-study course, you have demonstrated a desire to improve yourself and the Navy.
Remember, however, this self-study course is only one part of the total Navy training program. Practical
experience, schools, selected reading, and your desire to succeed are also necessary to successfully round
out a fully meaningful training program.
COURSE OVERVIEW: The objective of this course is to enable the student to identify and perform
calculations involving the equations to the various conic sections; recognize and work with concepts in
calculus (limits, differentiation, and integration); and recognize the elements of introductory probability
theory.
THE COURSE: This self-study course is organized into subject matter areas, each containing learning
objectives to help you determine what you should learn along with text and illustrations to help you
understand the information.
The subject matter reflects day-to-day requirements and experiences of
personnel in the rating or skill area. It also reflects guidance provided by Enlisted Community Managers
(ECMs) and other senior personnel, technical references, instructions, etc., and either the occupational or
naval standards, which are listed in the Manual of Navy Enlisted Manpower Personnel Classifications
and Occupational Standards, NAVPERS 18068.
THE QUESTIONS: The questions that appear in this course are designed to help you understand the
material in the text.
VALUE:
In completing this course, you will improve your military and professional knowledge.
Importantly, it can also help you study for the Navy-wide advancement in rate examination. If you are
studying and discover a reference in the text to another publication for further information, look it up.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR TAKING THE COURSE
ASSIGNMENTS
The text pages that you are to study are listed at
the beginning of each assignment. Study these
pages carefully before attempting to answer the
questions. Pay close attention to tables and
illustrations and read the learning objectives.
The learning objectives state what you should be
able to do after studying the material. Answering
the questions correctly helps you accomplish the
objectives.
SELECTING YOUR ANSWERS
Read each question carefully, then select the
BEST answer. You may refer freely to the text.
The answers must be the result of your own
work and decisions. You are prohibited from
referring to or copying the answers of others and
from giving answers to anyone else taking the
course.
SUBMITTING YOUR ASSIGNMENTS
To have your assignments graded, you must be
enrolled in the course with the Nonresident
Training Course Administration Branch at the
Naval
Education
and
Training Professional
Development
and
Technology
Center
(NETPDTC). Following enrollment, there are
two ways of having your assignments graded:
(1) use the Internet to submit your assignments
as you complete them, or (2) send all the
assignments at one time by mail to NETPDTC.
Grading on the Internet:
Advantages to
Internet grading are:
• 
you may submit your answers as soon as
you complete an assignment, and
• 
you get your results faster; usually by the
next working day (approximately 24 hours).
In addition to receiving grade results for each
assignment, you will receive course completion
confirmation once you have completed all the
assignments.
To
submit
your
assignment
answers via the Internet, go to:
http://courses.cnet.navy.mil
Grading by Mail: When you submit answer
sheets by mail, send all of your assignments at
one time. Do NOT submit individual answer
sheets for grading. Mail all of your assignments
in an envelope, which you either provide
yourself or obtain from your nearest Educational
Services Officer (ESO). Submit answer sheets
to:
COMMANDING OFFICER
NETPDTC N331
6490 SAUFLEY FIELD ROAD
PENSACOLA FL 32559-5000
Answer
Sheets:
All
courses
include
one
“scannable” answer sheet for each assignment.
These answer sheets are preprinted with your
SSN, name, assignment number, and course
number. Explanations for completing the answer
sheets are on the answer sheet.
Do not use answer sheet reproductions: Use
only
the
original
answer
sheets
that
we
provide—reproductions will not work with our
scanning equipment and cannot be processed.
Follow
the
instructions
for
marking
your
answers on the answer sheet. Be sure that blocks
1,
2,
and 3 are filled in correctly. This
information is necessary for your course to be
properly processed and for you to receive credit
for your work.
COMPLETION TIME
Courses must be completed within 12 months
from the date of enrollment. This includes time
required to resubmit failed assignments.

v
PASS/FAIL ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURES
If your overall course score is 3.2 or higher, you
will pass the course and will not be required to
resubmit assignments. Once your assignments
have been graded you will receive course
completion confirmation.
If you receive less than a 3.2 on any assignment
and your overall course score is below 3.2, you
will be given the opportunity to resubmit failed
assignments.
You
may
resubmit
failed
assignments only once. Internet students will
receive notification when they have failed an
assignment--they
may
then
resubmit
failed
assignments on the web site. Internet students
may
view
and
print
results
for
failed
assignments from the web site. Students who
submit by mail will receive a failing result letter
and a new answer sheet for resubmission of each
failed assignment.
COMPLETION CONFIRMATION
After successfully completing this course, you
will receive a letter of completion.
ERRATA
Errata are used to correct minor errors or delete
obsolete information in a course.
Errata may
also be used to provide instructions to the
student.
If a course has an errata, it will be
included as the first page(s) after the front cover.
Errata for all courses can be accessed and
viewed/downloaded at:

NOTE: When the derivative of a function is set equal
to zero, that does not mean in all cases we will have
found a maximum or minimum point on the curve. A
complete discussion of maxima or minima may be found in most
calculus texts.
To set the derivative equal to zero, we will require that the
following conditions be met:
1. We have a maximum or minimum point.
2. The derivative exists.
3. We are dealing with an interior point on the curve.
When these conditions are met, the derivative of the function
will be equal to zero.
EXAMPLE: Find the derivative of the function
y = 5x3 – 6x2 – 3x + 3
set the derivative equal to zero, and find the points of maximum
and minimum on the curve. Then verify this by drawing the graph
of the curve.
SOLUTION: Apply the formula for dy as follows:
dx
f(x + ∆x) = 5(x + ∆x)3 – 6(x + ∆x)2 – 3(x + ∆x) + 3
(1)
and
f(x) = 5x3 – 6x2 – 3x + 3
(2)
Expand equation (1) and subtract equation (2), obtaining
f(x + ∆x) – f(x) =
5(3x2∆x + 3x∆x2 + ∆x3) – 6(2x∆x + ∆x2) – 3∆x
Now, divide both sides by ∆x, and take the limit as ∆x→0 so that
= 15x2 – 12x – 3

TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS
If we are given
y = sin u
we may state that, from the general formula,
(5.3)
Since
(5.4)
and
(5.5)
Then by substituting equations (5.4) and (5.5) into equation (5.3),
(5.6)
Now we are interested in finding the derivative
dy of the
dx
function sin u, so we apply the chain rule
From the chain rule and equation (5.6), we find
