Introduction
In one of the ﬁrst attempts to apply regression techniques to economic data,
Moore (1914) estimated the “law of demand” for various commodities. In his
application the percentage change in the price per unit is explained by a linear
or cubic function of the percentage change of the produced quantities. His results
are summarized as follows:
“The statistical laws of demand for the commodities corn, hay, oats,
and potatoes present the fundamental characteristic which, in the clas-
sical treatment of demand, has been assumed to belong to all demand
curves, namely, they are all negatively inclined”.
(Moore 1914, p. 76). Along with his encouraging results, Moore (1914) estimated
the demand curve for raw steel (pig-iron). To his surprise he found a positively
sloped demand curve and he claimed he have found a brand-new type of demand
curve. Lehfeldt (1915), Wright (1915) and Working (1927) argued, however, that
Moore has actually estimated a supply curve because the data indicated a moving
demand curve that is shifted during the business cycle, whereas the supply curve
appears relatively stable.
This was probably the ﬁrst thorough discussion of the famous identiﬁcation
problem in econometrics. Although the arguments of Wright (1915) come close to
a modern treatment of the problem, it took another 30 years until Haavelmo (1944)
suggested a formal framework to resolve the identiﬁcation problem. His elegant

CHAPTER 0. INTRODUCTION
probabilistic framework has become the dominating approach in subsequent years
and was reﬁned technically by Fisher (1966), Rothenberg (1971), Theil (1971) and
Zellner (1971), among others.
Moore’s (1914) estimates of “demand curves” demonstrate the importance
of prior information for appropriate inference from estimated economic systems.
This is a typical problem when collected data are used instead of experimental
data that are produced under controlled conditions. Observed data for prices and
quantities result from an interaction of demand and supply so that any regression
between such variables require further assumptions to disentangle the eﬀects of
shifts in the demand and supply schedules.
This ambiguity is removed by using prior assumptions on the underlying eco-
nomic structure. A structure is deﬁned as a complete speciﬁcation of the prob-
ability distribution function of the data. The set of all possible structures S is
called a model. If the structures are distinguished by the values of the parameter
vector θ that is involved by the probability distribution function, then the identi-
ﬁcation problem is equivalent to the problem of distinguishing between parameter
points (see Hsiao 1983, p. 226). To select a unique structure as a probabilistic
representation of the data, we have to verify that there is no other structure in
S that leads to the same probability distribution function. In other words, an
identiﬁed structure implies that there is no observationally equivalent structure
in S. In this case we say that the structure is identiﬁed (e.g. Judge et al. 1988,
Chapter 14).
In this thesis I consider techniques that enables structural inference (that is
estimation and tests in identiﬁed structural models) by focusing on a particular
class of dynamic linear models that has become important in recent years. Since
the books of Box and Jenkins (1970) and Granger and Newbold (1977), time series
techniques have become popular for analysing the dynamic relationship between
time series. Among the general class of the multivariate ARIMA (AutoRegressive
Integrated Moving Average) model, the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model turns
out to be particularly convenient for empirical work. Although there are important
reasons to allow also for moving average errors (e.g. L¨utkepohl 1991, 1999), the

5
VAR model has become the dominant work horse in the analysis of multivariate
time series. Furthermore, Engle and Granger (1987) show that the VAR model is
an attractive starting point to study the long run relationship between time series
that are stationary in ﬁrst diﬀerences. Since Johansen’s (1988) seminal paper, the
cointegrated VAR model has become very popular in empirical macroeconomics.
An important drawback of the cointegrated VAR approach is that it takes the
form of a “reduced form representation”, that is, its parameters do not admit
a structural interpretation. In this thesis, I review and supplement recent work
that intends to bridge the gap between such reduced form VAR representations
and structural models in the tradition of Haavelmo (1944). To do this, I ﬁrst
discuss in Chapter 1 aspects of the reduced form model that are fundamental
for the subsequent structural analysis as well. In Chapter 2 I consider structural
models that take the form of a linear set of simultaneous equations advocated by
the inﬂuential Cowles Commission. An alternative kind of structural models are
known as “Structural VAR models” or “Identiﬁed VAR models”. These models
are considered in Chapter 3. Problems due to the temporal aggregation of time
series are studied in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 deals with some new approaches to
analyze nonlinear models. Chapter 6 concludes and makes suggestions for future
work.

CHAPTER 0. INTRODUCTION

Chapter 1
The reduced form
Since Haavelmo (1944) it is common in econometrics to distinguish a structural
model from the reduced form of an economic system. The reduced form provides
a data admissible statistical representation of the economic system and the struc-
tural form can be seen as a reformulation of the reduced form in order to impose
a particular view suggested by economic theory. Therefore, it is important to
specify both the reduced and structural representation appropriately.
In this chapter the vector autoregressive (VAR) model is used as a convenient
statistical representation of the reduced form relationship between the variables.
Zellner and Palm (1974) and Wallis (1977) argue that under certain conditions the
reduced (or ﬁnal) form of a set of linear simultaneous equations can be represented
as a VARMA (Vector-Autoregressive-Moving-Average) process.
Here it is as-
sumed that such a VARMA representation can be approximated by a VAR model
with a suﬃcient lag order. A similar framework is used by Monfort and Rabem-
ananjara (1990), Spanos (1990), Clemens and Mizon (1991), Juselius (1993) inter
alia.
The reduced form model is represented by a conditional density function of
the vector of time series yt conditional on It denoted by f(yt|It; θ), where θ is a
ﬁnite dimensional parameter vector (e.g. Hendry and Mizon 1983). Here we let
It = {yt−1, yt−2, . . .} and it is usually assumed that f(·|· ; θ) is the normal density.
Sometimes the conditioning set includes a vector of “exogenous variables”. How-
7

8
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
ever, the distinction between endogenous and exogenous variables is considered
as a structural problem and will be discussed in Chapter 2.
The speciﬁcation of an appropriate VAR model as a statistical representation
of the reduced form involves the following problems:
• The choice of the model variables.
• The choice of an appropriate variable transformation (if necessary).
• The selection of the lag order.
• The speciﬁcation of the deterministic variables (dummy variables, time trend
etc.)
• The selection of the cointegration rank.
This chapter contributes mainly to the last issue, that is, the selection of the
cointegration rank. Problems involved by deterministic variables are only touched
occasionally and the choice of an appropriate variable transformation is considered
only in the sense that the choice of the cointegration rank may suggest that (some
of) the variables must be diﬀerenced to obtain a stationary VAR representation.
We do not discuss the choice of the lag order because there already exists an
extensive literature dealing with this problem (cf.
L¨utkepohl 1991, L¨utkepohl
and Breitung 1997, and the references therein). Furthermore, it is assumed that
the variables of the system are selected guided by to economic theory.
If the reduced form VAR model is speciﬁed, it can be estimated by using
a maximum likelihood approach. For completeness I restate in Section 1.1 some
well-known results on the estimation of stationary VAR models that are enhanced
in Section 1.3 by introducing deterministic terms. Some useful representations
of cointegrated VAR models are considered Section 1.3. Section 1.4 suggests a
unifying approach for the estimation of the cointegration vectors and Section 1.5
discusses diﬀerent approaches for testing the cointegration rank.

1.1. THE STATIONARY VAR MODEL
9
1.1
The stationary VAR model
Assume that the n × 1 times series vector yt is stationary with E(yt) = 0 and
E(yty′
t+j) = Γj such that there exists a Wold representation of the form:
yt
=
ε∗
t + B1ε∗
t−1 + B2ε∗
t−2 + · · ·
(1.1)
=
B(L)ε∗
t ,
(1.2)
where B(L) = In + B1L + B2L2 + · · · is a (possibly inﬁnite) n × n lag poly-
nomial and ε∗
t is a vector of white noise errors with positive deﬁnite covariance
matrix E(ε∗
tε∗
t
′) = Σ∗. Furthermore, it is assumed that the matrix polynomial
|B(z)| ̸= 0 for all |z| ≤1. If in addition the coeﬃcient matrices B1, B2, . . . obey
P∞
j=1 j1/2||Bj|| < ∞, where ||Bj|| = [tr(BjB′
j)]1/2, then there exists a VAR repre-
sentation of the form
yt = A1yt−1 + A2yt−2 + · · · + ε∗
t .
In practice this inﬁnite VAR representation is approximated by a ﬁnite order
VAR[p] model:
yt = A1yt−1 + · · · + Apyt−p + εt ,
(1.3)
where εt = ε∗
t +Ap+1yt−p−1+Ap+2yt−p−2+· · · and, thus, the error vector εt includes
the approximation error ηp
t = Ap+1yt−p−1 + Ap+2yt−p−2 + · · ·. In what follows it
is assumed that the approximation error is “small” relative to the innovation ε∗
t
and so I am able to neglect the term ηp
t . With respect to the consistency and
asymptotic normality of the least-squares estimator, Lewis and Reinsel (1985)
have shown that the approximation error is asymptotically negligible if for →∞
and p →∞
√
T
∞
X
j=p+1
||Aj|| →0 .
(1.4)
In many cases this condition is satisﬁed if p increases with the sample size T but
at a smaller rate than T. For example, if yt is generated by a ﬁnite order MA
process, then p(T) = T 1/δ with δ > 3 is suﬃcient for (1.4) to hold (see L¨utkepohl
1991, p. 307).

10
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
Unfortunately, such asymptotic conditions are of limited use in practice. First,
there is usually a wide range of valid rates for p(T). For MA models we may use
p(T) = T 1/3.01 as well as p(T) = T 1/100. Obviously, both possible rules will render
quite diﬀerent model orders.
Second, a factor c may be introduced such that
p(T) = cT 1/δ. For asymptotic considerations the factor c is negligible as long as
c > 0. However, in small samples it can make a big diﬀerence if c = 0.1 or c = 20,
for example. In practice it is therefore useful to employ selection criteria for the
choice of the autoregressive order p (see L¨utkepohl 1991, Chapter 4).
For later reference I now summarize the basic assumptions of the VAR model
used in the subsequent sections.
Assumption 1.1 (Stationary VAR[p] model). Let yt = [y1t, . . . , ynt]′ be an n × 1
vector of stationary time series with the VAR[p] representation
yt = A1yt−1 + · · · + Apyt−p + εt ,
(1.5)
where {εt} is white noise with E(εt) = 0, E(εtε′
t) = Σ and Σ is a positive deﬁnite
n × n matrix.
Usually, the coeﬃcient matrices are unknown and can be estimated by multi-
variate least-squares. Let xt = [y′
t−1, . . . , y′
t−p]′ and A = [A1, . . . , Ap] so that the
VAR[p] model can be written as yt = Axt + εt. Then the least-squares estimator
is given by
bA =
T
X
t=p+1
ytx′
t
 
T
X
t=p+1
xtx′
t
!−1
.
Under Assumption 1.1 the least-squares estimator is consistent and asymptotically
normally distributed with
√
T vec( bA −A)
d
−→N(0, V b
A) ,
where
V b
A = [E(xtx′
t)]−1 ⊗Σ .
If in addition it is assumed that εt is normally distributed, then the least-squares
estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimator and,
hence, the least-squares estimator is asymptotically eﬃcient.

1.2. DETERMINISTIC TERMS

The covariance matrix Σ can be consistently estimated using
bΣ =

X
t=p+1
(yt −bAxt)(yt −bAxt)′ .
(1.6)
1.2
Deterministic terms
So far I have assumed that E(yt) = 0. In most applications, however, yt has a
nonzero mean such as a constant or a linear time trend. Assume that the mean
is a linear function of the k × 1 vector dt so that
E(yt) = Cdt .
(1.7)
For example, the elements of the matrix dt may be the terms of a polynomial time
trend or dummy variables.
Another possibility to accommodate a nonzero mean is to include deterministic
terms in the autoregressive representation
yt = C∗d∗
t + A1yt−1 + · · · + Apyt−p + εt .
(1.8)
The relationship between the mean function implied by (1.7) and (1.8) is found
from solving the diﬀerence equation
Cdt −A1Cdt−1 −· · · −ApCdt−p = C∗d∗
t .
If the elements of dt can be represented as tk for k = {0, 1, 2, . . .}, then d∗
t = dt.
However in other cases C ̸= C∗, in general.
The matrix C∗in (1.8) can be asymptotically eﬃciently estimated by OLS.
The mean function in (1.7) is asymptotically eﬃciently estimated by applying a
GLS procedure to
yt = Cdt + ut ,
(1.9)
where
ut = A1ut−1 + · · · + Aput−p + εt .
The GLS estimator of C results as
eC =

where
˜yt
=
yt −A1yt−1 −· · · −Apyt−p
˜dt
=
dt −A1dt−1 −· · · −Apdt−p .
To obtain a feasible GLS procedure, the unknown matrices A1, . . . , Ap must be
replaced by consistent estimates.
As shown by Grenander and Rosenblatt (1957, Sec. 7) there are important
cases where the OLS estimator of C is as eﬃcient as the GLS estimator. For
example, this is the case if the elements of dt are the terms of a polynomial trend
regression, i.e., dt = (tj)j=0,...,k. Another example are seasonal dummy variables,
which can be estimated eﬃciently by OLS (cf Grenander and Rosenblatt 1957, p.
246).
Besides trend polynomials and seasonal dummies the deterministic term often
includes “impulse-dummies” and “step-dummies”. Since such terms are not con-
sidered by Grenander and Rosenblatt (1957), the following theorem states that for
step-dummies a similar result applies while for an impulse-dummy the OLS esti-
mate has a diﬀerent limiting distribution than the GLS estimate. As in Grenander
and Rosenblatt (1957) I consider a univariate process but the generalization to a
vector process is straightforward.

where T0 = [λT], 0 < λ < 1, and [·] indicates the integer part of the argument.
(i) For the regression model yt = csds
t(λ)+ut, where ut = α1ut−1+. . .+αput−p+εt
is a stationary AR[p] process, the OLS and GLS estimates have the same limiting
distribution.
(ii) The respective estimates for the model yt = cpdp
t(λ) + ut have a diﬀerent
distribution as long as ut is diﬀerent from a white noise process.

and, thus, the GLS estimator has the same asymptotic distribution as the OLS

14
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
Unless σ2
u = σ2
ε, that is ut is white noise, the limiting distributions for the estima-
tors of cp are diﬀerent, in general. ■
Since the least-squares estimation of a VAR system is equivalent to the separate
estimation of the equations, it is straightforward to show that this result also holds
for a multivariate estimation of the VAR system. Furthermore it can be shown by
using the same techniques as in Theorem 1.1 that in a regression with a polynomial
trend dummy deﬁned as dj
t = d1
t(λ)tj the OLS and GLS estimates have the same
limiting distribution as well.
The Grenander-Rosenblatt theorem and its extension to step dummies in The-
orem 1.1 implies that for estimating the parameters of a VAR process the esti-
mation method (OLS or GLS) is irrelevant for the asymptotic properties.1 Fur-
thermore the invariance of the ML estimation implies that the ML estimation
of λ is identical to eλ = g(bθ), where g(·) is a matrix function Rk →Rk with a
regular matrix of ﬁrst derivatives and θ, λ are k × 1 vectors. Since there exists
a one-to-one relationship between C and C∗it therefore follows that asymptot-
ically the estimates of A1, . . . , Ap and Σ are not aﬀected whether the process is
demeaned by estimating the mean in (1.7) or in (1.8). Thus I present only the
limiting distributions for the case of an OLS based on (1.8).
THEOREM 1.2 Let yt−Cdt be a stationary n×1 vector generated by a VAR[p]
as in Assumption 1.1. Furthermore assume that there exits a diagonal matrix
ΥT = diag[T δ1, . . . , T δk] with δr > 0 for r = 1, . . . , k such that the limiting matrix

Since the asymptotic covariance matrix is block diagonal, it follows that any other
consistent estimator for C besides bC can be used without aﬀecting the asymptotic
properties of the other estimators. Thus, even if a mean function is used where
the Grenander-Rosenblatt theorem does not apply, the limiting distributions of
A1, . . . , Ap and Σ are not aﬀected by the estimator of C as long as C is estimated
consistently. Furthermore a possible overspeciﬁcation of the deterministic terms
does not aﬀect the asymptotic properties of the estimators of A1, . . . , Ap and Σ.

Alternative representations of cointegrated
VARs
As already observed by Box and Jenkins (1970), many economic variables must
be diﬀerenced to become stationary. They introduced the notation that a (mean-
adjusted) variable is called I(d) (integrated of order d) if at least d diﬀerences
are necessary to achieve a stationary series. Modeling integrated time series in a
multivariate system raises a number of important problems and since the late 80s
various inference procedures were suggested to deal with such problems. It is not
the intention to give a detailed account of all developments in this area.2 Rather,
I focus on the most important developments as well as on my own work in this
area.
Consider the VAR[p] model
yt = A1yt−1 + · · · + Apyt−p + εt ,
(1.11)
where for convenience we leave out deterministic terms like constants, time trends
and dummy variables. As noted in Section 1.1, the process is stationary if the
polynomial A(L) = In −A1L −· · · −ApLp has all roots outside the unit circle,
that is, if
|In −A1z −· · · −Apzp| ̸= 0
for all |z| ≤1 .
On the other hand, if |A(zj)| = 0 for |zj| = 1 and j = 1, 2, . . . , q, we say that the
process has q unit roots. In what follows, I will focus on unit roots “at frequency
zero”, i.e., zj = 1 for j = 1, 2, . . . , q. Complex unit roots are important in the
analysis of the seasonal behavior of the time series but are left out here for ease
of exposition.
To assess the properties of the process, it is not suﬃcient to consider merely the
number of unit roots. For example, assume that the process for yt = [y1t, y2t, y3t]′
has two unit roots. This may be due to fact that [∆y1t, ∆y2t, y3t] is stationary,
where ∆= 1 −L denotes the diﬀerence operator. Another possibility is that
2For recent surveys see, e.g., Hamilton (1994), Watson (1994), Mills (1998), L¨utkepohl
(1999a).

1.3. ALTERNATIVE REPRESENTATIONS OF COINTEGRATED VARS
17
[∆2y1t, y2t, y3t] is stationary, i.e., y1t is I(2) in the terminology of Box and Jenkins
(1970). Finally the unit roots may be due to the fact that [∆y1t, ∆y2t, y3t −by1t]
is stationary.
In this case y3t and y1t are integrated but there exists a linear
combination y3t −by1t that is stationary. In this case we say that the variables y3t
and y1t are cointegrated.
To facilitate the analysis, it is convenient to rule out that components of yt
are integrated with a degree larger than one. The analysis of I(2) variables is
considerably more complicated than the analysis of I(1) variables (see, e.g., Stock
and Watson 1993, Johansen 1995c), and in empirical practice the case with I(1)
variables is more important. We therefore make the following assumption:
Assumption 1.2 The vector ∆yt is stationary.
The VECM representation. Following Engle and Granger (1997) it is conve-
nient to reformulate the VAR system as a “vector error correction model” (VECM)
given by
∆yt = Πyt−1 + Γ1∆yt−1 + · · · + Γp−1∆yt−p+1 + εt ,
(1.12)
where Π = Pp
j=1 Aj −In and Γj = −Pp
i=j+1 Ai. This representation can be used
to deﬁne cointegration in a VAR system.
DEFINITION 1.1 (Cointegration). A VAR[p] system as deﬁned in Assumption
1.1 is called cointegrated with rank r, if r = rk(Π) with 0 < r < n.
If Π has a reduced rank then there exists a factorisation Π = αβ′ such that α
and β are n×r matrices. Furthermore, from Assumption 1.2 and (1.12) it follows
that Πyt−1 = αβ′yt−1 is stationary. Since α is a matrix of constants, β′yt deﬁnes r
stationary linear combinations of yt. Furthermore, it follows that ∆yt has a MA
representation of the form
∆yt
=
εt + C1εt−1 + C2εt−1 + · · ·
∆yt
=
C(L)εt .
As shown by Johansen (1991), the MA representation can be reformulated as
∆yt = C(1)εt + C∗(L)∆εt ,
(1.13)

18
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
where C∗(L) = C∗

C(1) = β⊥[α′

(1.14)
and Γ(1) = I + Pp−1
j=1 Γj (Johansen 1991, Theorem 4.1). Assumption 1.2 implies
that the matrix [α′
⊥Γ(1)β⊥] is invertible.
A canonical representation. The VECM representation used by Engle and
Granger (1987), Johansen (1995a) and many others is not the only way to rep-
resent a cointegrated system. Phillips (1991) uses a “triangular representation”
resulting from the partitioning yt = [y′
1t, y′
2t]′, where y1t and y2t are r × 1 and
(n −r) × 1 subvectors. In the subsequent sections it will be convenient to use
another representation that is based on the following theorem.
THEOREM 1.3 Let yt be a n×1 vector of cointegrated variables with 0 < r < n
and ∆yt is stationary. Then there exists an invertible matrix Q = [β∗, γ∗]′, where
β∗is an n × r cointegration matrix and γ∗is an n × (n −r) matrix linearly
independent of β∗such that

where [aT] signiﬁes the integer part of aT and Wr(a), Wn−r(a) are uncorrelated r
and (n −r) dimensional Brownian motions with unit covariance matrix.

where γ is an n×(n−r) matrix linearly independent of β and C∗∗(L) = [C∗(L)−
C∗(1)](1 −L)−1 has all roots outside the complex unit circle. The expression
(1 −L)−1 is equivalent to the polynomial 1 + L + L2 + L3 + . . .. Let R be a lower

i=1 x1i and T −1/2x2,[aT] converge weakly to the standard
Brownian motions Wr and Wn−r, respectively (e.g. Phillips and Durlauf 1986).
■
This representation is called “canonical” since it transforms the system into r
asymptotically independent stationary and n −r nonstationary components with
uncorrelated limiting processes. Since this representation separates the stationary
and non-stationary components from the system it is convenient for the analysis
of the asymptotic properties of the system. Furthermore, the representation is
related to Phillips’ (1991) triangular representation given by
y1t
=
By2t + ut
(1.15)
∆y2t
=
vt ,
(1.16)
where ut and vt are I(0). However, (1.15) implies the normalization β = [Ir, −B]′
that is not assumed in the former representation.
The SE representation. Another convenient reformulation of the system is
the representation in the form of a traditional system of Simultaneous Equations
(SE). This representation imposes r2 normalization restrictions on the loading

(1.17)
where φ is an unrestricted r × (n −r) matrix. Obviously, φ′ = α1α−1
2 , where
α = [α′

2]′ and α2 is an invertible r × r matrix. Note that the variables in yt
can always be arranged such that α2 is invertible.
The system (1.12) is transformed by using the matrix
C0 =

(1.18)
where Π∗= C0αβ′ = [0, π2]′, Γ∗
j = C0Γ and π′
2 = α2β′ is the lower r × n block of
Π = αβ′. Let yt = [y′
1t, y′
2t]′, then (1.18) can be represented by the two subsystems:
∆y1t = φ′∆y2t + lags + w1t
(1.19)
∆y2t = π′
2yt−1 + lags + w2t
(1.20)
where “lags” represent the terms due to ∆yt−1, . . . , ∆yt−p+1. Although, the sys-
tem (1.18) is written as a structural model considered by Hsiao (1997), it is not
a “structural” system in the usual sense. It should further be noticed that in
(1.19) the rank restrictions show up in the form of (n −r)2 linear over-identifying
restrictions. The remaining r equations in (1.20) are just identiﬁed. The SE rep-
resentation turns out to be useful for imposing restrictions on the parameters (see
Chapter 2).
1.4
Weak exogeneity in stationary VARs
An important structural assumption is the distinction between exogenous and
endogenous variables. Let z′
t = [y′
t, x′
t], where yt and xt are m × 1 and k × 1
vectors of time series, respectively. Furthermore we deﬁne the increasing sigma-
ﬁeld Zt = {zt, zt−1, zt−2, . . .}. Then, according to Engle et al. (1983) the variable

1.4. WEAK EXOGENEITY IN STATIONARY VARS
21
xt is (weakly) exogenous if we can factorize the joint density of zt with parameter
vector θ = [θ′
1, θ′
2]′ as
f(zt|Zt−1, ; θ) = f1(yt|xt, Zt−1; θ1) · f2(xt|Zt−1; θ2)
such that the parameter vector θ1 of the conditional density f1(·|· ; θ1) does not
depend on the parameter vector θ2 of the conditional density f2(·|· ; θ2), and θ1
and θ2 are variation free, that is, a change in θ2 has no eﬀect on θ1 (cf Engle et
al. 1983).
In the dynamic structural model given in (??) the parameter θ1 comprises the
elements of the matrices Γ0, . . . , Γp, B0, . . . , Bp and the non-redundant elements of
Σ. To embed the structural form in a corresponding form derived from the VAR
representation of the system we deﬁne the matrix
Q =
"
Im
−Σ12Σ−1

Ik
#
,
where the covariance matrix of the VAR innovations Σ = E(εtε′
t) is decomposed
as
"
Σ11
Σ12
Σ21
Σ22
#
such that Σ11 is the covariance matrix of the innovations of yt and Σ22 is the
covariance matrix of the innovations of xt. Multiplying the VAR system (1.5) by
Q yields a block recursive system of the form
Φ0zt = Φ1zt−1 + · · · + Φpzt−p + vt
(1.21)
or for the ﬁrst m equations
yt = Φ12xt + Φ1,1zt−1 + · · · + Φ1,pzt−p + v1t ,
(1.22)
where Φ0 = Q, Φ12 = Σ12Σ−1
22 and the matrix Φ1,j denotes the upper m × n
block of the matrix Φj = QAj for j = 1, . . . , p. Similarly, vt is partitioned as
Qεt = vt = [v′
1t, v′
2t]′, where the covariance matrix of vt is block diagonal with
respect to v1 and v2.

22
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
In many applications, economic theory does not imply restrictions on the short
run dynamics of the system.3 Thus we follow Monfort and Rabemananjara (1990)
and assume that there are no restrictions on the matrices Γ1, Γ2, . . . , Γp. Premulti-
plying (1.22) by B0 and comparing the result with (??) gives rise to the following
characterization of a vector of weakly exogenous variables.
DEFINITION 1.2 Let zt = [y′
t, x′
t]′ be an n × 1 time series vector with a sta-
tionary VAR[p] representation as given in Assumption 1.1 and εt ∼N(0, Σ). The
subvector xt is weakly exogenous for the parameters of the structural form (??),
iﬀ
B0Φ12 = Γ0 .
(1.23)
It is straightforward to show that this deﬁnition is indeed equivalent to the deﬁ-
nition of weak exogeneity suggested by Engle et al. (1983). From (1.22) it follows
that
E(yt|xt, zt−1, . . . , zt−p) = Φ12xt + Φ1,1zt−1 + · · · + Φ1,pzt−p
Accordingly, if xt is predetermined, the parameters of the structural form result
as functions from the parameters of the conditional mean and variance of yt given
xt, zt−1, . . . , zt−p. Under normality it follows that the vector of structural param-
eters θ1 in f1(yt|xt, Zt−1; θ1) does not depend on θ2 in f2(xt|Zt−1; θ2).
If there are (cross-equation) restrictions on the matrices B1, . . . , Bp some ex-
tra conditions are needed to ensure that xt is weakly exogenous (see Monfort
and Rabemananjara 1990). An important example for such restrictions are rank
restrictions in cointegrated systems.
Assume that the structural analog of a cointegrated system can be represented
as
C0zt = C1zt−1 + C2zt−2 + · · · + Cpzt−p + et ,
(1.24)
where zt = [y′
t, x′
t]′ is partitioned such that
C0 =

tations (e.g. Wickens 1982).

23
and the upper m × n block of Cj (j = 1, . . . , p) is equal to [Bj, Γj]. The error
vector et = [u′
t, w′
t]′ is white noise. Accordingly, the upper m equations of the
system yield a traditional structural form as given in (??). The structural system
as given in (1.24) is obtained from the reduced form VAR representation (1.5) by
a pre-multiplication with the matrix C0.
Premultiplying the reduced form VECM (1.12) by C0 the structural form of
the cointegrated system is obtained (cf Johansen and Juselius 1994)
B0∆yt = α∗
1β′zt−1 + Γ0∆xt + Γ∗
1∆zt−1 + · · · + Γ∗
p−1∆zt−p+1 + ut ,
(1.25)
where Γ∗
j is the upper m×n block of the matrix C0Γj and α∗
1 = [Γ0, B0]α. Without
additional restrictions both expectations E(yt|xt, zt−1, . . . ,zt−p) and E(yt|zt−1, . . . ,
zt−p) depend on the error correction term β′zt−1, in general. It follows that the
parameter vectors θ1 in f1(yt|xt, Zt−1; θ1) and θ2 in f2(xt|Zt−1; θ2) depend on β
and, hence, xt is not weakly exogenous in the sense of Engle et al. (1983). How-
ever, if the lower k × n block of α (resp. Π) is a zero matrix, that is, the error
correction term does not enter the “marginal model”, then the vector θ1 does not
depend on β (see Boswijk and Urbain (1997) and the references therein).
As before let
E(yt|xt, zt−1, . . . , zt−p) = Φ12xt + Φ1,1zt−1 + · · · + Φ1,pzt−p .
If there are no restrictions on Γ∗
1, . . . , Γ∗
p−1, Deﬁnition 1.2 can be straightforwardly
adapted to the case of weak exogeneity in a cointegrated system.
DEFINITION 1.3 Let z′
t = [y′
t, x′
t] be a (m + k) × 1 time series vector with
a cointegrated VAR[p] representation given in (1.12) and εt ∼N(0, Σ).
The
subvector xt is weakly exogenous with respect to the structural VECM given in
(1.25), iﬀ
(i)
B0Φ12 = Γ0
and (ii)
α2 = 0,
where α2 is the lower k × r block of the matrix α.

24
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
This deﬁnition of weak exogeneity is more general than the deﬁnition suggested
by Johansen (1992b), who assumes that B0 = I and Boswijk and Urbain (1997),
who assume that the matrix B0 is block triangular.
In the latter case , the
condition (i) of Deﬁnition 1.3 can be replaced by the condition (i’) E(utw′
t) = 0,
where et = [u′
t, w′
t] is the vector of disturbances in (1.24).
If xt is weakly exogenous for the structural parameters B0, Γ0, Γ∗
1, . . . , Γ∗
p−1,
then the partial system (1.25) can be estimated eﬃciently without involving the
marginal model for xt (Johansen 1992b). In particular, if m = 1, the parameters
can be estimated eﬃciently by OLS on the single equations. Dolado (1992) shows
that condition (ii) in Deﬁnition 1.3 is not necessary to establish the eﬃciency of
the OLS estimator. The reason is that for an eﬃcient OLS estimator it is required
that
lim
T→∞E(∆xTu′
T) = 0 .
This condition is satisﬁed by imposing α2 = 0 but it may also be fulﬁlled by
imposing restrictions on β⊥(cf. Dolado 1992).
1.5
Identifying restrictions
Consider the structural VECM model given by (1.25). To achieve a unique iden-
tiﬁcation of the structural form, restrictions on the parameters are required. Fol-
lowing Hsiao (1997) I ﬁrst make the following assumption:
Assumption 1.3 It is assumed that |B0| ̸= 0 and T −2
TP
t=1
xtx′
t converges in dis-
tribution to a nonsingular random matrix.
Hsiao (1997) shows that this assumption implies that the roots of the poly-
nomial B0 + B1L + · · · + BpLp lie outside the unit circle and, thus, the usual
stability condition for dynamic systems (e.g. Davidson and Hall 1991) is satisﬁed.
An important property of the stable dynamic system is that the distribution of yt
conditional on xt does not depend on initial conditions.
Johansen and Juselius (1994) distinguish four kinds of identifying assumptions:

1.5. IDENTIFYING RESTRICTIONS
25
(i) Linear restrictions on the contemporary relationships:
R0vec(B0, Γ0) = r0 .
(1.26)
(ii) Restrictions on the short run dynamics:
R1vec(Γ∗
1, . . . , Γ∗
p−1) = r1 .
(1.27)
(iii) Restrictions on the long run relationships:
Rβvec(β) = rβ .
(1.28)
(iv) Restrictions on the “loading matrix”:
Rαvec(α∗
1) = rα .
(1.29)
In principle we may also include restrictions on the covariance matrix Σ in the
list of identifying assumptions. However, in the traditional Cowles-Commission
type of structural models such restrictions are not very common. In contrast,
the “structural VAR approach” which is considered in Chapter 3 relies heavily on
covariance restrictions.
To identify the parameters of the structural form, a suﬃcient number of re-
strictions is required. Hsiao (1997) calls the matrix Π∗
1 = α∗
1β′ “long run rela-
tion matrices”. He assumes that linear restrictions are imposed on the matrix
A∗= [B0, Γ0, Γ∗
1, . . . , Γ∗
p−1, Π∗
1] so that for the g’th equation the restriction can
concisely be written as R∗
ga∗
g = 0, where a∗
g is the g’th column of A∗′ and R∗
g is a
known matrix. In this case the rank condition is
rk(R∗
gA∗′) = m −1 .
Hsiao (1997) emphasize that this rank condition is equivalent to the usual rank
condition in the SE model and, thus, cointegration does not imply additional
complications to the identiﬁcation problem. However, this is only true if Π∗
1 is
considered as the long run parameter matrix. In Johansen’s (1995b) framework
the long run parameters are represented by the matrix β and the nonlinearity im-
plied by the product α∗
1β′ indeed imply additional problems for the identiﬁcation

26
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
of the system. Speciﬁcally Johansen (1995b) points out that the rank condition
must be checked for every possible value of β. He suggests a sequential procedure
to verify a more restrictive concept labeled as “generic identiﬁcation”.
In practice, identiﬁcation is often checked by applying the so-called order con-
dition, which is a necessary condition for identiﬁcation. The application of these
criteria for restrictions of the form (i) and (ii) is well documented in many econo-
metric text books (e.g. Judge et al. 1988, Hamilton 1994) and there is no need
to repeat the discussion here. Rather I will concentrate on the structural form of
a cointegrated system given in (1.25).
First, I consider the identiﬁcation of the cointegration matrix β. Johansen and
Juselius (1990, 1992) consider restrictions of the form
Rβ = 0,
j = 1, . . . , r
(1.30)
or
β = Hϕ,
(1.31)
where R is a given (n−q)×n matrix and H is a n×q matrix obeying RH = 0 and
q ≤n −r. Comparing this restriction with (1.28) reveals two diﬀerences. First,
the restriction (1.30) assumes rβ = 0. This speciﬁcation excludes the restriction of
cointegration parameters to prespeciﬁed values. Since the cointegration property
is invariant to a scale transformation of the cointegration vector, such constants
are not identiﬁed.4 Second, all r cointegration vectors are assumed to satisfy the
same linear restriction Rβj = 0, where βj is the j’th row of β. Of course, this is
a serious limitation of such type of restrictions. Nevertheless, in many empirical
applications, the restrictions on the cointegration vectors can be written as in
(1.30) (e.g. Johansen and Juselius 1990, 1992, Hoﬀman and Rasche 1996).
Of course, if there is only one cointegration vector, then this kind of restriction
does not imply a loss of generality. Another important class of restrictions covered
by (1.30) is the case that the basis of the cointegration space is known. As in King
et al. (1991) assume that yt = [ct, it, ot]′, where ct denotes the log of consumption,
4To facilitate the interpretation, the cointegration vectors are often normalized so that one of
the coeﬃcients is unity. However such a normalization does not restrict the cointegration space
and is therefore not testable.

1.5. IDENTIFYING RESTRICTIONS
27
it is the log of investment, and ot denotes the log output. Suppose that ct −ot and
it −ot are stationary. Accordingly, the cointegration space can be represented as
β =


1
0
0

−1


ϕ .
Another important special case are “separable restrictions”, that is, restrictions
that apply to diﬀerent parts of the cointegration vectors.
An example is the
restriction:
"
1
−1
0

0

1

#
β = 0 .
Notwithstanding these cases encountered frequently in practice, the restriction
(1.30) rules out important cases. Johansen and Juselius (1994) therefore consider
more general restrictions given by
diag(R1, . . . , Rr)vec(β) = 0
or
β = [H1ϕ1, . . . , Hrϕr] ,
(1.32)
where Hj is a n×qj matrix and ϕj is a qj ×1 vector with qj ≤n−r. This set of re-
strictions is more general than (1.30), since it allows for diﬀerent linear restrictions
on the cointegration vectors. However, no restrictions across cointegration vec-
tors are accommodated. Such restrictions between diﬀerent cointegration vectors,
however, do not seem to be important in practice.
To identify the cointegration vector βj it is required that no other cointegration
vector (or a linear combination thereof) satisfy the restriction for βj. Accordingly,
the rank condition results as
rk(Rjβ1, . . . , Rjβr) = r −1
(cf. Johansen and Juselius 1994). The problem with the application of such a
rank condition is that it depends on the (unknown) parameter values β1, . . . , βr.
To overcome the diﬃculties Johansen and Juselius (1994) suggest a criterion to
check for generic identiﬁcation. Inserting (1.32) gives
rk(RjH1ϕ1, . . . , RjHrϕr) = r −1 .

28
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
From this rank condition Johansen (1995) derives a sequence of rank criteria which
can be used to check the identiﬁcation for “almost all” possible vectors β. Fur-
thermore a simple order condition can be derived. Since (Rjβ) is a qj × r matrix,
qj ≥r −1 restrictions are needed to identify βj in addition to a normalization
restriction.
Davidson (1998) suggests an “atheoretical” approach to achieve unique coin-
tegration vectors that are identiﬁed up to a scale transformation. A cointegration
vector is called irreducible if no variable can be omitted from the cointegration
relationship without loss of the cointegration property. Such an irreducible coin-
tegration vector is unique up to a scale transformation. Davidson (1998) provides
a program that allows to determine the irreducible cointegration vectors from an
estimated cointegration matrix.
Whenever the long run parameters β are properly identiﬁed, the short run
parameters can be identiﬁed in the usual way. Letting wt = β′yt, the structural
form of the VECM can be written as
B0∆yt = α∗
1wt−1 + Γ0∆xt + Γ∗
1∆zt−1 + · · · + Γ∗
p−1∆zt−p+1 + ut ,
(1.33)
which takes the form of a traditional linear system of simultaneous equations. It
follows that the “short run parameters” B0, Γ0, α∗
1, Γ∗
1, . . . , Γ∗
p−1 can be identiﬁed
by applying the traditional rank or order conditions (e.g. Judge et al. 1988, Hsiao
1997).
As in Johansen and Juselius (1994) it is assumed that the long run and short
run parameters were identiﬁed separately. However, as pointed out by Boswijk
(1995), it is possible to identify β by using restrictions on α. For example, assume
that α is restricted to have a form similar to α = [Ir, α2]′. Then β is identiﬁed
and can be computed from the reduced form as the upper block of the matrix
Π = αβ′. This identiﬁcation is used in the SE representation of a cointegrated
system which is discussed in Section 1.3. The mixed case using restrictions on α
and β together to identify β is more complicated and does not seem important
for the empirical practice. See Boswijk (1995) for more details.
As in the usual SE model, the identifying assumptions are derived from eco-
nomic theory. The assumptions on the long run relationships often result from

1.6. ESTIMATION UNDER LONG RUN RESTRICTIONS
29
equilibrium conditions on markets for goods and services, whereas the short run
restrictions are more diﬃcult to motivate.
An important source of short run
restrictions is the theory of rational expectations. Unfortunately, the resulting
restrictions usually imply highly nonlinear cross equation restrictions that are
diﬃcult to impose on the SE systems. Therefore, the short run restrictions are
often imposed by making informal (“plausible”) assumptions or by testing the
coeﬃcients against zero (the simpliﬁcation stage of Hendry’s methodology). Ex-
amples are Juselius (1998) and L¨utkepohl and Wolters (1998). Similarly, Garratt
et al. (1999) advocate a diﬀerent treatment of long and short run restrictions.
They derive the long run relationships from (steady state) economic theory and
impose these restrictions on the cointegration vectors of a cointegrated VAR. The
resulting model for the long run relationship is called the “core model”:
β′zt −c0 −c1t = wt ,
where the vector zt = [y′
t, x′
t]′ comprises the endogenous and exogenous variables
of the system and β is subject to linear restrictions given in (1.28). At the second
stage, the short run response is represented in the model of the usual form (1.25).
The lag length of the adjustment model is selected by using conventional informa-
tion criteria like AIC or the BIC (cf. L¨utkepohl 1991). Furthermore, coeﬃcients
may be set to zero whenever they turn out to be insigniﬁcant with respect to a
prespeciﬁed signiﬁcance level.
1.6
Estimation under long run restrictions
First the estimation of cointegrated VAR models with restrictions on the coin-
tegration vectors is considered. Since we assume that all other parameters are
unrestricted, the model can be estimated in its concentrated form:
∆eyt = αβ′eyt−1 + eεt ,
(1.34)
where ∆eyt and eyt−1 are residual vectors from a regression of ∆yt and yt−1 on
∆yt−1, . . . , ∆yt−p+1 and possible deterministic terms. The concentrated form is

30
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
equivalent to a cointegrated VAR[1] model. In what follows we therefore drop the
tildes for notational convenience.
In the case that the restrictions on β take the form as in (1.31), Johansen and
Juselius (1990, 1992) suggest a simple ML estimation procedure. The restriction
is inserted in the VECM format (1.34) yielding
∆yt
=
αφ′H′yt−1 + εt
=
α∗y∗
t−1 + εt ,
(1.35)
where α∗= αφ′ and y∗
t−1 = H′yt−1.
The restricted cointegration vectors can
easily be estimated from a reduced rank regression of ∆yt on y∗
t−1 (cf Johansen
and Juselius 1992).
To estimate the model under the more general set of restrictions given in (1.32)
no such simple reformulation of the model is available. Inserting the restriction
for the j’th cointegration vector in (1.34) gives
∆yt =
r
X
j=1
αjϕ′
jH′
jyt−1 + εt .
(1.36)
Assume that we want to estimate the parameters of the ﬁrst cointegration vector
ϕ1. Equation (1.36) can then be reformulated as
∆yt = α1ϕ′
1H′
1yt−1 + ϑ′
2yt−1 + εt ,
(1.37)
where ϑ2 = [β2, . . . , βr]. The idea of the switching algorithm suggested by Jo-
hansen (1995) is to estimate α∗
1 = α1ϕ′
1 conditional on an initial estimate of the
remaining cointegration vectors stacked in ϑ2. In other words the system is es-
timated by treating the additional variables z2t = ϑ′
2yt−1 as given.
With the
resulting estimate of β1 a new set of variables is formed that are treated as given
for the estimation of the second cointegration vector. Therefore, the procedure
employs updated cointegration vectors on every estimation stage and proceeds
until the estimates have converged.
Johansen (1995b) was not able to show that his “switching algorithm” indeed
converges to the global maximum of the likelihood function. Nevertheless, his
method is computationally convenient and seems to have reasonable properties in

1.6. ESTIMATION UNDER LONG RUN RESTRICTIONS
31
practice. It is implemented in the PcGive 9.0 software of Doornik and Hendry
(1996).
Pesaran and Shin (1995) consider the ML estimation of the restricted likelihood
function which is equivalent to maximizing the function
S∗(β, λ) = log |β′ATβ| −log |β′BTβ| + 2λ′Hβvec(β) ,
(1.38)
where AT = S11 −S01S11S′
01 and BT = S11 with Sij as deﬁned in Section 1.4 and
restrictions of the general form (1.28) with rβ = 0. The derivative is
∂S∗(β, λ)
vec(β)
=

[(β′ATβ)−1 ⊗AT] −[(β′BTβ)−1 ⊗BT]

vec(β) + H′
βλ .
From this derivative and ∂S∗(β, λ)/λ = Hβvec(β), Pesaran and Shin (1995) derive
a ﬁrst order condition which can be written as vec(β) = f(β), where f(β) is a
complicated nonlinear function. Based on this ﬁrst order condition they suggest
an iterative scheme, where the updated estimate β(1) results from the preliminary
estimate β(0) as f(β(0)). An important problem with such a procedure is, however,
that it is unknown whether it converges to a maximum. Pesaran and Shin (1995)
therefore suggest a “generalized Newton Raphson procedure” based on the ﬁrst
and second derivatives of S∗(β, λ) given in (1.38). This estimator turns out to
be quite complicated but can be implemented by using numerical techniques (cf
Pesaran and Shin (1995) for more details).
Hsiao (1997) argues that structural models can be estimated in the usual way
(e.g. using 2SLS, 3SLS or FIML) from a structural version of the VECM model.
However, this is only possible if the long run restrictions can be written as linear
restrictions on the matrix Π∗
1 = α∗
1β′. Unfortunately, the matrix Π∗mixes short
and long run parameters so that a linear restriction on β must be translated
into linear restriction on Π∗. A simple way to do this is suggested in Breitung
(1995b). As in Section 1.3 we reformulate the system using α∗= αα−1
2
= [φ, Ir]′
and φ = α1α−1
2 . Furthermore, we deﬁne π2 = βα′
2 so that α∗π′
2 = αβ′.

CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
so that the resulting system can be written as
∆y1t = φ′∆y2t + w1t
(1.39)
∆y2t = π′
2yt−1 + w2t ,
(1.40)
where yt = [∆y′
1t, ∆y′
2t]′. For more details on this representation see Section 1.3.
The restriction for the j’th cointegration vector can be formulated as
βj = π2aj = Hjϕj ,
j = 1, . . . , r ,
where aj is the j’th row of α−1
2 . Inserting this restriction into the subsystem (1.40)
gives

j,t−1 + w∗
2t ,
(1.41)
where w∗
2t = a′
jw2t and y∗
j,t−1 = H′
jyt−1. Accordingly, the lower subsystem of the
structural model (1.40) is replaced by equations of the form (1.41), where the
vector y∗
j,t−1 is a vector of transformed variables.
An example may help to illustrate the approach. To highlight the key features
of the transformation, consider the following example. Let yt = [Yt, Rt, rt, Mt]′,
where Yt is the log of output, Rt and rt are a long term and a short term interest
rates, and Mt is the log of real money balances. Economic theory gives rise to two
cointegrating relationships, namely, a money demand relationship and the term
structure of interest rates. Accordingly, the cointegration space can be represented
as b1Mt −b1Yt + b2Rt + b3rt ∼I(0) and b4Rt −b4rt ∼I(0) (see, e.g., Hoﬀman
and Rasche, 1996, p. 194). Hence, under this hypothesis the cointegration space
is given by the matrix

Imposing these restrictions gives the following structural form:

=
−a21∆rt + ϕ21(Rt−1 −rt−1) + w∗

To estimate this system, the third and fourth equation must be divided by a11
and a22, respectively. The resulting system can be estimated with conventional
system estimators such as the 3SLS or the FIML estimator and no additional
complications arise by the cointegration properties of the system (cf. Hsiao 1997).
The asymptotic properties of the 2SLS and 3SLS estimator are given in
THEOREM 1.4 Let yt be generated by a cointegrated VAR[1] with 0 < r <
n. Furthermore, J1 and J2 are known matrices satisfying rk(J1α) = s ≤r and
rk(β′J2) ≤s. Then:
(i) The 2SLS and 3SLS estimates of φ in (1.39) are identical.
(ii) The 2SLS and the 3SLS estimates of J1π′J2 are
√
T–consistent and asymp-
totically normally distributed with the same non-singular covariance matrix.
Proof: (i) As has been shown by Zellner and Theil (1962) the 2SLS and 3SLS
estimates of an over-identiﬁed subsystem are identical if the remaining equations
are just identiﬁed.
(ii) The model can be re-written as

which does not depend on Ω. Thus, the limiting distributions of the 2SLS and
the 3SLS estimators are the same.
(iii) Since B3 is normally distributed it is seen from (ii) that the IV estimator
for θ1 is asymptotically normal. Furthermore, B1 is the limit of T −2 P β′
⊥yt−1y′
t−1β⊥
and B4 is the limit of T −1 P β′
⊥yt−1 so that B−1
1 B4 is mixed normal. The IV esti-
mate of the matrix π2 is equivalent to the product of IV estimates bα2,iv bβ′
iv. Since
bβ is super-consistent, the asymptotic behaviour is similar to bα2,ivβ′. Therefore a
necessary condition for J1bπ′
2,iv to have a regular normal limiting distribution is
that the matrix J1 has rank s1 ≤r rows. Similarly, it is easy to show that a sec-
ond necessary condition is that bπ′
2,ivJ2 = bα2,ivβ′J2 whenever rk(β′J2) ≤s because
otherwise the rank of the covariance matrix is singular. ■
Remark A: It is important to notice that the cointegration parameters are not
estimated super-consistently but have the usual rate for coeﬃcients attached to
stationary variables. The reason is that in the SE system the matrix π2 = βα′
2 is
a product of short and long run parameters so that the properties implied by the
short run parameters dominate the asymptotic properties of the estimate of π2.
Remark B: Since the system (1.39) – (1.40) is a linear transformation of the
VECM system, the FIML estimate bπ2 is identical to (ˆβ ˆα′
2), where bβ and bα2 denote
Johansen’s (1988) ML estimators. Accordingly, T−consistent estimates of the
cointegration vectors can be obtained by post-multiplying bπ2 with the inverse of
bα′
2.
It will be shown below that if the cointegration vectors are identiﬁed by
using suﬃcient long run restrictions, the associated parameters can be estimated
T−consistently.

36
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
Remark C: The matrix of coeﬃcients attached to the lagged levels admits the
expansion bπ2 = bα2β′ + Op(T −1), where bα2 is the least-squares estimate of α2 in
the regression ∆y2t = α2zt−1 + w2t and z = β′yt. Thus, for any ﬁxed matrices J1
and J2 the estimates are
√
T−consistent and asymptotically normal. To obtain a
nonsingular covariance matrix of J1π′
2J2, rank conditions on the matrices J1 and
J2 are required.
Next, we consider the Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) estimator.
Using the SE representation (1.39) and (1.40) the following lemma gives simple
expressions for the scores of the likelihood function.
LEMMA 1.1 (i) Let bB1(zt) and bB2(zt) denote the least-squares estimates of B1
and B2 in a regression
zt = B1w1t + B2w2t + et ,
where w1t, w2t are (n−r)×1 and r×1 subvectors such that wt = [w′
1t, w′
2t]′ = C0εt.
Then, the scores of the likelihood function for the SE model given in (1.39) – (1.40)
can be written as
∂L(φ, π2)
∂φ′
=
bB1(∆y2t)
∂L(φ, π2)
∂π′
2
=
bB2(yt−1),
where L(·) denotes the (conditional) log-likelihood function.
Proof: (i) For convenience we ﬁrst orthogonalize the system given by (1.39)
and (1.40) so that it is written in a recursive form.
Let w1t = H1w2t + v1t,
E(w2tw′
2t) = Σ22, H1 = [E(w2tw′
2t)]−1E(w2tw′
1t) such that v1t is orthogonal to w2t
and Σ1|2 denotes the covariance matrix of v1t. Then, the log-likelihood function
is given by

Using the expressions for the scores in this lemma, a simple scoring algorithm
can be constructed by replacing the conditional expectations by least-squares
coeﬃcients from multivariate regressions of the respective vectors on the residuals
bw1t, bw2t of the previous iteration.
It is interesting to know whether the asymptotic equivalence of the estimators
is also reﬂected in small samples. To this end a small Monte Carlo experiment is
performed. The data are generated according to the model

value as T →∞. In our experiment we let π21 ∈{1, 0.5, 0.2}, T ∈{100, 1000}
and M = 1000.
As can be seen from Table 2.1 the alternative estimators perform roughly
similar in samples as large as T = 1000. Moreover, the standardized RMSE are of
the same magnitude conﬁrming our theoretical result that all estimates are

1.7. RESTRICTIONS ON SHORT RUN PARAMETERS

consistent. In small samples, however, the performance of the estimators depends
crucially on the parameter π21. This parameter determines the importance of the
random walk component in y2t and thus aﬀects the validity of the asymptotic
approximation in small samples. In eﬀect, if π21 is small, the dynamic properties
of the series y2t are dominated by the stationary term ε2t. For stationary variables
the 3SLS (and FIML) estimates are more eﬃcient than the 2SLS estimates, so
that a gain in eﬃciency is observed for π21 = 0.2. For a more important random
walk component in y2t we observe that all estimators perform similarly.
An important problem is the normalization of the equation (1.41). Usually
the matrix C0 is normalized to have unit elements on the leading diagonal. This
normalization implies that the variable with a unit coeﬃcient is the dependent
variable in the equation.
For this normalization, all parameter estimates are
asymptotically normal with the usual convergence rate of
√
T.
The reason is
that the ML estimate of π′
2 = α2β′ is identical to bα2bβ′, where bα2 and bβ denote
the ML estimates using Johansen’s approach.
Since bα2 is
√
T-consistent and
asymptotically normal, the asymptotic properties of bπ2 are dominated by the
properties of bα2.
If one is interested in super-consistent estimates of the cointegration param-
eters, a normalization with respect to the cointegration parameters is required.
A possibility is to normalize the cointegration vectors as in Phillips (1991). This
is achieved by letting bβP = bπ2(bπ21)−1, where bπ21 is the upper r × r block of bπ2.
The resulting estimator is T−consistent and has the same asymptotic properties
as Phillips’ (1991) estimator.
1.7
Restrictions on short run parameters
Following Johansen and Juselius (1994) and Hsiao (1997), the parameters α∗
1, Γ0,
Γ∗
1, . . . , Γ∗
p−1 in (1.25) are classiﬁed as “short run parameters”. Usually, economic
theory is silent about the short run parameters Γ∗
1, . . . , Γ∗
p−1. Therefore, these
parameters are left unrestricted and, thus, these parameters can be “partialled
out” for convenience. In contrast, economic theory often motivates hypotheses on

40
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
the loading matrix α (or α∗
1).
Hypotheses on α. Johansen (1991) and Johansen and Juselius (1992) consider
the null hypothesis
Rαα = 0
or
α = Aϕα ,
(1.48)
where Rα is a known (n −q) × n matrix and A is an n × q matrix satisfying
RαA = 0. Note that q cannot be smaller than r because otherwise the rank of α
is smaller than r.
To estimate the system under restriction (1.48) we consider again a VAR[1]
model and assume that no other restrictions are imposed. Following Johansen
(1995a, p.
124) the system is multiplied by the matrices ¯A and A⊥with the
properties that ¯A′A = I and A′
⊥A = 0 so that

(see Johansen, 1995a, Theorem 8.2). Estimates for the cointegration vectors are
obtained as the eigenvectors of the eigenvalue problem (1.49).
Since this approach is fairly complicated, it is attractive to consider the cor-
responding procedure in the SE approach.
Premultiplying the (concentrated)
VECM format with Rα gives
Rα∆yt = ε∗
t
where ε∗
t = Rαεt.

1.7. RESTRICTIONS ON SHORT RUN PARAMETERS
41
An important special case of linear restrictions on α is the hypothesis that a
subset of variables is weakly exogenous. Let zt = [y′
t, x′
t]′, where yt and xt are
m × 1 and k × 1 subvectors. Then, the conditional model for yt given xt can be
estimated eﬃciently if xt is weakly exogenous for the parameters of the conditional
model in the sense of Engle, Hendry and Richard (1983). From Deﬁnition 1.3 it
follows that this is the case if the error correction term β′yt−1 does not enter the
marginal system for xt and, thus, the corresponding block α2 is equal to zero.
This restriction can easily be imposed using the simultaneous equation ap-
proach given in (1.39) – (1.40). The null hypothesis (1.48) implies that the rows
of Rα lie in the space spanned by the columns of the orthogonal complement α⊥.
Accordingly, the null hypothesis can be imposed by replacing the upper n−q rows
of transformation matrix C0 by the ﬁrst n −q rows of Rα.
As an example, assume that we want to test whether the variable it in the
cointegrated system yt = [Yt, it, Mt]′ is weakly exogenous. If we assume a single
cointegration relationship, this hypothesis implies that the second element of the
vector α is zero. Accordingly Rα = [0, 1, 0] and the model becomes
∆it
=
w1t
(1.50)
∆Yt
=
a1∆Mt + w2t
(1.51)
∆Mt
=
b1Yt−1 + b2it−1 + b3Mt−1 + w3t .
(1.52)
The additional over-identifying restriction in (1.50) can be tested, e.g., using an
LR test procedure, for example. In our example it is also possible to test the
restriction by testing whether the additional inclusion of ∆Mt in equation (1.50)
yields a signiﬁcant coeﬃcient.
Hypotheses on α may also be motivated by a structural model for the per-
manent shocks deﬁned as τt = α′
⊥εt (cf. Johansen 1995, p. 74). For example, a
real business cycle framework implies that the permanent shocks are related to
the technical progress (or other supply side factors) and, thus, it may be asserted
that innovations of monetary variables do not enter the permanent shock. To
identify the ﬁrst permanent shock of the system (1.50) — (1.52) as a real shock,
we may therefore set the coeﬃcient a1 equal to zero, which is of course identical
to assuming that Yt is weakly exogenous.

42
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
The information that some variables in yt are exogenous may also be used to
improve the power of the LR test for the cointegration rank (Harbo et al. 1998
and Pesaran et al. 1999). Consider a VAR[1] process for the vector zt = [y′
t, x′
t]′,
where yt is a vector of m endogenous variables and xt is the vector of k exogenous
variables. Following Harbo et al. (1998) assume that the structural VECM can be
written as in (1.25) where B0 = Im and the matrices Γ0 and Γ∗
j (j = 1, . . . , p −1)
are assumed to be unrestricted. Hence, the only restriction, which is used is that
xt is exogenous and, thus, the respective submatrix of α in the reduced form
VECM is equal to zero. The concentrated model results as
∆eyt = Π∗
1ezt−1 + eut ,
where eyt and ezt−1 are the residuals from a regression of yt and zt−1 = [y′
t−1, x′
t−1]′
on ∆xt, . . . , ∆xt−p+1. The LR test of the hypothesis r = r0 results as the sum of
the eigenvalues from a reduced rank regression of ∆eyt on ezt−1. As shown by Harbo
et al. (1998) the resulting LR (trace) statistic is asymptotically distributed as
Λ(r0)

Wn−r(a)dWm−r(a)′o
and, thus, the table for the critical values must account for the dimensions m and
r (see Harbo et al. 1998).
Rahbek and Mosconi (1999) consider tests of the cointegration rank in the
presence of weakly exogenous I(0) regressors. Let xt denote a stationary weakly
exogenous variable. Rahbek and Mosconi (1999) suggest forming the partial sum
process x∗
t = x1+· · ·+xt and include x∗
t instead of xt in the system. The resulting
cointegration vector is restricted not to include the variables in x∗
t and the usual
LR test procedures can be applied in the system z∗
t = [y′
t, x∗
t
′]′.
Testing causality. Another important hypothesis concerning the short run pa-
rameters of the system is that some variables are not causal for other variables of
the system. Let yt be partitioned as yt = [y′
1t, y′
2t, y′
3t]′, where the three subvectors
are of dimension n1, n2 and n3, respectively. If y2t is not causal for y1t accord-
ing to the deﬁnition of Granger (1969), then E(y1,t+1|It) = E(y1,t+1|I∗
t ), where

1.7. RESTRICTIONS ON SHORT RUN PARAMETERS
43
It = {yt, yt−1, . . .} and I∗
t = {y1t, y3t, y1,t−1, y3,t−1, . . .}. Although this hypothesis
imposes restrictions on the matrices Π = αβ′ and Γ1, . . . , Γp−1 in (1.12), we con-
centrate our discussion to the restrictions on the matrix Π. Restrictions on the
matrices Γ1, . . . , Γp−1 do not imply additional complications.
Toda and Phillips (1993, 1994) consider two approaches to test the causality
hypothesis. First, the hypothesis may be tested by using an unrestricted VAR in
levels. In a VAR[1] system4 this amounts to testing whether the estimated matrix
eΠ12 from the partitioning
eΠ =

is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the zero matrix. Since this estimator has asymptotic
representation eΠ12 = bα1β′
2 + Op(T −1), where αj and βj (j = 1, 2, 3) are subma-
trices of α and β partitioned according to the subvectors of yt. To obtain an
asymptotically normal estimator for Π12 with a nonsingular covariance matrix we
need to assume that rk(β2) = r2. This condition is called “suﬃcient cointegration”
by Toda and Phillips (1994). Of course this condition may fail in practice and
for this case, Toda and Phillips (1993) show that the asymptotic distribution of
the Wald statistic is nonstandard and depends on nuisance parameters. Assume
for example that n = 3 and r = 1 with a cointegration vector β = [β1, 0, β3]′ so
that rk(β2) = 0. In this case the Wald statistic fails to yield an asymptotically χ2
distributed test statistic.
The second approach is to estimate α and β by using Johansen’s ML estima-
tor and testing whether bα1bβ′
2 is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero. This approach
suﬀers from a similar rank problem and suﬃcient conditions for χ2 distributed
test statistics are the rank conditions (i) rk(β2) = r2 or (ii) rk(α1) = n1 (cf Toda
and Phillips 1993).
Dolado and L¨utkepohl (1996) and Toda and Yamamoto (1995) suggest an
elegant approach to resolve these problems. They show that the Wald test has
the usual χ2 distribution whenever the VAR model is estimated with an additional
lag which is, however, not included in the null hypothesis. This test is called the

44
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
“lag-augmentation test” for causality. Assume that we estimate a VAR[2] model
instead of the true VAR[1] process.
Then, the estimator of Π12 results from
replacing y1t and y2,t−1 by the residual vectors from the regressions of y1t and
y2,t−1 on yt−2. In contrast to the original variables, these residuals are stationary
and, therefore, the resulting estimate for Π12 has standard asymptotic properties
and the Wald statistic is valid in any case. Of course this approach implies a loss
of power because the model is augmented with unnecessary regressors.
The causality hypothesis can also be implemented in the SE approach. Assume
that the system can be arranged so that the last n1 < r equations have y1t as the
set of dependent variables. If there is no causality from y2t, then the respective
coeﬃcients of the matrix π′
2 in the lower n1 equations are zero. Of course, the
dimension of the vector must have a dimension lower than r which is also assumed
in the work of Toda and Phillips (1993, 1994). Furthermore from Theorem 1.4 (iii)
rank conditions for α1 and β2 can be deduced that are the same as in Toda and
Phillips (1993, 1994). Therefore, the SE approach suﬀers from the same problems
as the other approaches.
1.8
Deterministic terms
In this section the treatment of deterministic terms is discussed. Following Jo-
hansen (1994) we will conﬁne ourselves to the case of a constant and linear trend.
Models with dummy variables like intervention dummies or seasonal dummies can
be handled in a similar manner.
For convenience we consider again a cointegrated VAR[1] model. Since we can
concentrate out any unrestricted higher order dynamics this does not imply a loss
of generality. Introducing a linear time trend in the VECM representation yields
∆yt = µ∗
0 + µ∗
1t + Πyt−1 + εt .
(1.53)
Since ∆yt is allowed to have a linear time trend, yt may have a quadratic time
trend, in general. Accordingly, the demeaned VECM can be written as
∆yt −µ0 −µ1t = Π

yt−1 −µ0 −µ1(t −1) −µ2(t −1)2
+ εt .

To match both sides of the equation we obtain Πµ2 = 0 or, equivalently, β′µ2 = 0.
The vectors µ∗
i (i = 0, 1) can be projected onto the subspaces spanned by the
columns of α and α⊥:

i = αbi + α⊥ci ,
(1.55)
where bi = (α′α)−1α′µ∗
i and ci = (α′

(1.57)
where µ∗

j.
Johansen (1994) considers 5 hypotheses of interest which are included in Table
2.2.
Using the representation given in (1.56) and (1.57) these hypotheses can

46
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
be formulated by using restrictions on c∗
0, c∗
1, µ∗
20 and µ∗
21 (see Table 2.2). Thus,
Johansen’s hypotheses about the deterministic part of the model can conveniently
be tested using LR tests for restrictions on the constant and the drift. Since the
tests are based on a linear transformation of the model, the LR statistics have the
same asymptotic χ2 distributions as in Johansen (1994).
1.9
An empirical example
To illustrate the estimation and test procedures discussed in this chapter we con-
sider a four variable system yt = [Yt, Rt, rt, Mt]′ as in Hoﬀman and Rasche (1996).
We use quarterly U.S. data running from 1970(i) through 1994(iv). Output (Yt)
is measured by the log of real GNP, Rt is the ten year government bond yield,
the short term interest rate rt is measured by the 3-month LIBOR and Mt is the
log of the money base M3 adjusted by the implicit price deﬂator of GNP. The
data for Yt and Mt are seasonally adjusted and taken form the Main Economic
Indicator data base of the OECD. The interest rates are taken from the IMF data
base.
We start with an appropriate deterministic speciﬁcation. For this purpose an
unrestricted linear trend is included and the lag order of the VAR is determined.
The BIC and Hannan-Quinn criteria are minimized by a VAR[2] speciﬁcation so
a VAR[2] model is used for the following analysis. The likelihood ratio statistics
cannot reject the null hypothesis that there is no trend term in the VAR represen-
tation (H1(r)). Since the hypothesis H∗
1(r) : c∗
0 = 0 is rejected but H∗(r) : c∗
1 = 0
cannot be rejected, I conclude that the unconditional mean of the variables can
be represented by a linear time trend.
Next, the cointegration rank is selected. This can be done by using Johansen’s
test based on eigenvalues or by using a likelihood ratio test on the restrictions in
the SE representation (1.39) – (1.40). The results of both procedures are presented
in Table 2.3. As expected, both approaches yield identical results and suggest that
the cointegration rank is r = 2.
Economic theory suggests (see, e.g., Hoﬀman and Rasche 1996) that the two

cointegration relationships are a money demand relation
Mt = Yt + β1Rt −β2rt + u1t
(1.58)
and the term structure relation
Rt = rt + u2t ,
(1.59)
where u1t and u2t are stationary error terms. Although the order condition for
identiﬁcation is fulﬁlled for these two cointegration vectors, the rank condition is
violated. This can be seen by subtracting δ(Rt −rt −u2t) = 0 from the right hand
side of (1.58) yielding
Mt = Yt + (β1 −δ)Rt −(β2 −δ)rt + (u1t + δu2t) .

48
CHAPTER 1. THE REDUCED FORM
For any value for δ this gives a new cointegrated relationship and, therefore, β1
and β2 are not jointly identiﬁed. However, the diﬀerence between the coeﬃcients
of the interest rates is identiﬁed. In practice one may therefore normalize one of
the coeﬃcients to be equal to zero by letting δ = β2, for example. In this case the
interest rate rt cancels from the money demand relation and the coeﬃcient of Rt
measures the diﬀerence β1 −β2. For a detailed discussion of this and alternative
identiﬁcation procedures see Hoﬀman and Rasche (1996, 194f).
The corresponding system of simultaneous equations is estimated as
∆eYt
=
0.030∆ert + 2.693∆f
Mt + ew1t
∆eRt
=
−0.773∆ert −138.4∆f

∆f
Mt
=
−0.0007∆ert −0.025(f
Mt−1 −eYt−1) −0.0007Rt−1 + ew4t ,
where the constants of the equations are suppressed. From these estimates, the
money demand relation results as Mt = Yt −0.026Rt + ˆu1t, where 0.026 is the
estimated diﬀerence between β1 and β2 in (1.58). The LR test statistic for the
over-identifying restriction in the term structure equation (1.59) is 0.9905 which is
not signiﬁcant with respect to the critical values of an asymptotic χ2-distribution
with one degree of freedom. Exactly the same value of the test statistic results if
the test statistic is computed by using the LR procedure of Johansen and Juselius
(1994).
Finally, we test whether the variables Yt and Rt are weakly exogenous. Ap-
plying the simultaneous equations approach suggested in Section 1.3 we test that
the corresponding row of the matrix α is zero. The LR statistic for the hypothesis
that Yt is weakly exogenous is 24.349. This value is highly signiﬁcant with respect
to an asymptotic χ2 distribution with two degrees of freedom. In contrast, the
LR statistic for the hypothesis that Rt is exogenous is only 1.340 and, therefore,
implies that this variable may be treated as (weakly) exogenous. These results
correspond well with conventional wisdom suggesting that the long run interest
rate is determined outside the system on the international capital markets (e.g.
Nautz and Wolters 1999).

Chapter 2
Structural VARs
Until the late 70th, the simultaneous equation approach, advocated by the inﬂuen-
tial Cowles Commission clearly dominated the empirical research in econometrics.
However, the initial optimism about the potential of the simultaneous equation
model was not fulﬁlled and the inability of large macroeconomic models to com-
pete with “atheoretic” Box-Jenkins ARIMA models on predictive grounds led to
an increased adoption of time series techniques. In particular, the seminal paper
by Sims (1980) prepared the ground for the ultimate success of vector autoregres-
sions in econometrics. However, as argued forcefully by, e.g., Cooley and LeRoy
(1985), vector autoregressions have the status of “reduced form” and, thus, are
merely vehicles to summarize the dynamic properties of the data. Without refer-
ring to a speciﬁc economic structure such reduced form VAR models are diﬃcult
to understand. For example, it is often diﬃcult to draw any conclusion from the
large number of coeﬃcient estimates in a VAR system. As long as such parameters
are not related to “deep” structural parameters characterizing preferences, tech-
nologies, and optimization behaviour, the parameters do not have an economic
meaning and are subject to the so-called “Lucas critique”.
The new research program known as Real Business Cycle (RBC) agenda em-
ploys dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models that are driven by real tech-
nology shocks.
In later work (e.g.
Christiano and Eichenbaum 1992) further
“shocks” like demand shocks resulting from public expenditures or the supply of
49

50
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
money were included to represent other aspects of the economic system. Kyd-
land and Prescott (1982) acknowledge from the outset that their models, like all
models, are false and they recognize that traditional econometric estimation pro-
cedures such as Gaussian maximum likelihood may be inappropriate. Therefore,
they advocate to apply less structured “calibration” methods, that is, the param-
eters underlying the simulated model economy are typically set to values that are
considered to be “reasonable” or in agreement with earlier estimates.
At the same time, Sims (1981, 1986), Bernanke (1986) and Shapiro and Watson
(1988) put forward a new kinds of econometric model that is now known as “struc-
tural VAR” (SVAR) or “identiﬁed VAR” approach. There are several features of
this approach that make the SVAR model an attractive model for empirical work
in the spirit of the RBC agenda. First, the deviations from the steady state of a
RBC model can usually be represented by a (vector) ARMA model that can be
conveniently approximated by a vector autoregression. Second, the driving forces
of an RBC type model are diﬀerent kinds of exogenous shocks. This parallels the
structural shocks identiﬁed from a typical SVAR model.
The similarity of the RBC and the SVAR approach initiated several stud-
ies comparing the outcomes of calibrated RBC models with the corresponding
ﬁndings from estimating a SVAR model. Cogley and Nason (1995) are able to
produce a good correspondence between both approaches, whereas Cooley and
Dwyer (1998) observe that results from SVAR models are sensitive to the identi-
fying assumption and may produce outcomes that are at odds with the original
RBC style model.
Using German data, Breitung and Heinemann (1998) ﬁnd
that both approaches yield qualitatively similar ﬁndings but diﬀer substantially
in detail.
Another important motivation for the development of SVAR models was the
paradigm of “rational expectations” (cf Sims 1980). In Section 3.1 the relationship
between rational expectation models and the identiﬁcation of shocks is discussed.
Diﬀerent approaches to identify the structural shocks are discussed in Section
3.2. A general class of structural VAR models is presented in Section 3.3 and
Section 3.4 discusses alternative approaches to estimate the structural parameters.

2.1. RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS
51
Section 3.5 suggests a latent variable framework that can be used for estimation
and inference. Long run restrictions are considered in Section 3.6 and inference
on impulse response function is considered in Section 3.7. Section 3.8 gives three
empirical applications and Section 3.9 discusses problems of the structural VAR
approach.
2.1
Rational expectations
The theory of rational expectations implies that the eﬀects of expected policy
actions are generally diﬀerent from the eﬀects of an unexpected policy.
This
can be demonstrated using the money demand model of Cuthbertson and Taylor
(1989).1
Assume that (real) money demand Mt is decomposed into a planned compo-
nent M p
t and an unplanned component εM
t . It is assumed that agents choose short
run money balances to minimize the expected present value of a quadratic loss
function. This gives rise to the planned money demand of the form
M p
t = β1Mt−1 + β1(1 −β2)
∞
X
j=0
βj
2Et−1(M ∗
t+j) ,
where 0 < β1, β2 < 1 are parameters implied by the quadratic loss function, Et−1
denotes expectation with respect to the information available at time t −1 and
M ∗
t = γ0 + γ1Yt + γ2it
denotes the desired long run money balances which are obtained by ignoring
adjustment costs (cf.
Cuthbertson and Taylor 1989).
The variable Yt and it
represent (logged) output and the relevant interest rate.
The unplanned component is represented as
εM
t
= Mt −Et−1Mt = b1εY
t + b2εi
t + uM
t ,
(2.1)
i.e., the εM
t
is a weighted average of the prediction errors εY
t = Yt −Et−1Yt and
εi
t = it −Et−1it and an additional error uM
t .
1The relationship between rational expectations and SVAR models is discussed in Dhrymes
and Thomakos (1998).

52
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
We are now in the position to compare the eﬀects of an expected and an
unexpected monetary policy using the interest rates as instruments. A predictable
change in it aﬀects the observed money demand via the expected long run money
demand Et−1(M ∗
t+j), whereas an unexpected change in the interest rate enters the
unplanned component with coeﬃcient γ1. Accordingly, the eﬀects of expected and
unexpected changes in the interest rates may be quite diﬀerent (see also McCallum
1999). The SVAR approach focuses on the eﬀects of unexpected variation in the
policy instrument by using a linear relationship similar to (2.1).
If expectations of M ∗
t+j are linear with respect to the information set {xt−1, xt−2,
. . .}, where xt = [Mt, Yt, it]′, we obtain
Mt
=
ψ0 +
∞
X
j=1
x′
t−jψj + b1εY
t + b2εi
t + uM
t
.
This equation contains all typical features of an SVAR model. The conditional
expectation with respect to the past of the process is µM
t−1 = ψ0 + P∞
j=1 x′
t−jψj.
In an SVAR model this expectation is approximated by a ﬁnite number of lags in
all variables of the system. Furthermore, possible (nonlinear) restrictions on the
parameters ψ1, ψ2, . . . resulting from the particular rational expectation model
are ignored in order to keep the estimation procedure “sophisticatedly simple”
(Zellner 1992). The terms b1εY
t and b2εi
t represent the part of the prediction error
of Mt that is due to other variables like Yt and it and, thus, the remaining error
uM
t
represents the “autonomous” shock associated with real money balances.
To sum up, it is seen that models involving rational expectation can be repre-
sented as an SVAR model. The resulting structural shocks represent the “news”
in the variable that cannot be explained by other variables of the system and,
therefore, measure the autonomous contribution to the respective variables. It is
quite natural to focus on the dynamic eﬀects of such shocks when assessing the
impact of political instruments on the target variables.

2.2. THE IDENTIFICATION OF SHOCKS
53
2.2
The identiﬁcation of shocks
As already noted, structural shocks are the central quantities in an SVAR model.
These shocks are unpredictable with respect to the past of the process and are the
input of a linear dynamic system producing the n-dimensional time series vector
yt. These shocks are attached with an economic meaning such as an oil price
shock, reuniﬁcation shock, exchange rate shock or a monetary shock. It should
be noted, however, that these shocks do not only represent disastrous singular
events. In contrast, we assume that the economy is hit regularly by such shocks
and the size of the shock is usually small.
Since the shocks are not directly observed, assumptions are needed to identify
them. There seems to be a consensus that structural shocks should be mutually
uncorrelated (and thus “orthogonal”). This assumption is required to consider the
dynamic impact of an isolated shock. If the shocks were correlated, we would have
to take into account the relationship between the shocks. Moreover, the decom-
position into orthogonal components has a long tradition in statistical analysis,
and is also used in factor analysis, for example. Another possibility is to consider
the shocks as bits of information about the state of the economic system. Hence,
the news of the system is projected into a particular orthogonal space, where the
axes represent diﬀerent aspects of reality.
The assumption of orthogonal shocks is, however, not suﬃcient to achieve
identiﬁcation. For an n dimensional system, n(n −1)/2 additional restrictions
are necessary. These restrictions can be obtained from a “timing scheme” for
the shocks. Such an identiﬁcation scheme assumes that the shocks may aﬀect a
subset of variables directly within the current time period, whereas another subset
of variables is aﬀected with a time lag only. An example of such an identiﬁcation
scheme is the triangular (or recursive) identiﬁcation suggested by Sims (1980).
In this model the shocks enter the equation successively so that the shock of the
second equation does not aﬀect the variable explained by the ﬁrst equation in the
same period. Similarly, the third shock does not aﬀect the variables explained by
the ﬁrst and second equation in the current time period. Such a scheme is called
a “Wold causal chain system” (Wold 1960) and is often associated with a causal

54
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
chain from the ﬁrst to the last variable in the system.
An alternative approach to the identiﬁcation of the shocks is to formulate
structural equations for the errors of the system. In this case it is convenient to
think of the equations as an IS curve or a money demand relation, for example,
but with the diﬀerence that the equations apply to the unexpected part of the
variables (the “innovations”) instead of the variables themselves. If the equations
are valid for the system variables, then they also apply for the unexpected part of
the variables. Therefore, the identiﬁcation using a set of simultaneous equations
is appealing with respect to the traditional approach advocated by the Cowles
Commission and it is not surprising that this kind of identiﬁcation has become
very popular in empirical work using SVAR models.
In recent work, the identiﬁcation of shocks using restrictions on the long run
eﬀects of structural shocks has become popular. In many cases economic theory
suggests that the eﬀects of some shocks are zero in the long run, that is, the
shocks are transitory with respect to particular variables. For example, classical
economic theory implies that the eﬀect of nominal shocks on real variables like
output or unemployment vanishes as time goes by. Such assumptions give rise to
nonlinear restrictions on the parameters and may be used to identify the structure
of the system. However, recent work demonstrates (e.g. Faust and Leeper 1997)
that such long run restrictions may be problematical in practice.
There are several important diﬀerences between the identiﬁcation of an SVAR
model and the identiﬁcation of a simultaneous equation model. First, the latter
models are usually identiﬁed by linear (exclusion) restrictions. In contrast, SVAR
models assume orthogonal shocks so that the structure is identiﬁed using also
restrictions on the covariance matrix of the errors. This complicates the estimation
of such systems considerably.
Second, traditional simultaneous equation models usually employ many more
restrictions than necessary to identify the system, that is, these models are often
highly over-identiﬁed. In his famous critique, Sims (1980) qualiﬁes these overly
restricted models as “incredible”. SVAR proponents therefore try to avoid to over-
simplifying the structure and impose just enough restrictions needed to identify

2.2. THE IDENTIFICATION OF SHOCKS
55
the structure. Accordingly, most SVAR models are just identiﬁed. However, it
is important to notice that just identiﬁed models are merely a convenient refor-
mulation of the reduced form. Therefore, as long as the reduced form is correctly
speciﬁed, any just identiﬁed structure is also correctly speciﬁed in a statistical
sense and it is not possible to decide between alternative identiﬁed structures on
empirical grounds. To quote Dhrymes and Tomakos (1998, p. 190):
“Thus, two just identifying sets of conditions, which have diametri-
cally opposed economic implications may well have the same empirical
justiﬁcation, viz. the estimates of the reduced form parameters in the
context of which they are applied. As such they do not add anything
further to our understanding of the economic phenomenon in question
over and above what was conveyed by the reduced form, and they are
both equally defensible or equally subject to severe criticism.”
SVAR models are used to quantify prior views of the economy and to assess the
plausibility of the outcomes. For example, we may use a Keynesian structure
to investigate the long run eﬀects of a monetary shock on unemployment.
A
monetarist economist would in contrast favour an SVAR model with the restriction
that the long run eﬀect of a monetary shock on real variables vanishes. Since both
structures are based on the same reduced form, both structures are admissible and,
thus, it is not possible to decide which model “is true”.
However, it is possible to assess the plausibility of the outcomes. If, for ex-
ample, a Keynesian economist ﬁnds that an expansive monetary shock leads to
increasing unemployment and rising prices, then such result would be highly im-
plausible with respect to a Keynesian framework.
If, on the other hand, our
Keynesian economist would ﬁnd that the eﬀects of a monetary shock are similar
to the eﬀects in a monetarist type of model, then this result suggests that the
observed eﬀect of a monetary policy is not sensitive with respect to the diﬀerent
orthodox perspectives (e.g. Dolado, Lopez-Salido and Vega 1999).

CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
2.3
A class of structural VARs
Assume that the n × 1 time series vector yt admits a stationary VAR[p] repre-
sentation as deﬁned in Assumption 1.1. This VAR model is referred to as the
reduced form of the system. Associated with the reduced form is a structural form
resulting from the set of structural equations:
Bεt = Rut ,
(2.2)
so that
Byt = BA1yt−1 + · · · + BApyt−p + Rut .
(2.3)
The matrices B and R are assumed to be invertible and ut is an n × 1 vector of
structural shocks with covariance matrix E(utu′
t) = Ω. This includes all models
considered by Amisano and Giannini (1997).
The dynamic eﬀect of the structural shocks is analysed by considering the
moving average representation
yt
=
εt + Φ1εt−1 + Φ2εt−2 + · · · ≡Φ(L)εt
=
B−1Rut + Φ1B−1Rut−1 + Φ2B−1Rut−2 + · · · = Ψ(L)ut ,
where Φ(L) = A(L)−1 and Ψ(L) = A(L)−1B−1R. If yt is measured in ﬁrst diﬀer-
ences, then the matrix
Ψ ≡Ψ(1) = (In −A1 −· · · −Ap)−1B−1R
(2.4)
measures the long run impact of ut on the levels of yt.
To identify the parameters, restrictions on the parameter matrices B, R, A1,
. . . , Ap, Ωare necessary. In empirical applications such restrictions are suggested
by economic theory or are imposed just for convenience. The most popular kinds
of restrictions can be classiﬁed as follows:
(i) The structural errors are assumed to be mutually uncorrelated such that
Ω= E(utu′
t) is a diagonal matrix. In some applications, the shocks are
normalized to have a unit variance, i.e., Ω= In.

2.4. ESTIMATION
57
(ii) R = In. The vector of innovations (εt) is modeled as an interdependent
system of linear equations such that Bεt = ut, where B is normalized to have
ones on the leading diagonal and linear restrictions of the form Q1vec(B) =
h1 are imposed. Empirical examples include Sims (1986), Bernanke (1986)
and Shapiro and Watson (1988).
(iii) B = In. In this case the model for the innovations is εt = Rut and to exclude
some (linear combinations of the) structural shocks in particular equations,
restrictions of the form Q2vec(R) = h2 are imposed. Empirical examples
can be found in Blanchard and Quah (1989), Roberts (1993) and Ahmed et
al. (1993).
(iv) The AB-model of Amisano and Giannini (1997) combines (ii) and (iii) such
that the model for the innovations is Bεt = Rut. Accordingly, the two sets
of restrictions Q1vec(B) = h1 and Q2vec(R) = h2 are used to identify the
system.
Empirical examples are provided by Blanchard (1989) and Gali
(1992).
(v) If (some of) the variables are measured in ﬁrst diﬀerences, there may be
prior information on the long run eﬀect of the shocks. The long run eﬀect
of the shocks are measured by the matrix Ψ which is deﬁned in (2.13). If a
shock is assumed to have no permanent eﬀect on the elements of yt, then the
respective elements of Ψ are zero. Such linear restrictions can be written
as Q3vec(Ψ) = h3 (see, e.g.
L¨utkepohl and Breitung 1997).
Empirical
examples are given by Blanchard and Quah (1989), King et al. (1991) and
Roberts (1993).
2.4
Estimation
The estimation of the SVAR model is equivalent to the problem of estimating a
simultaneous equation model with covariance restrictions. Using (2.2) the struc-
tural model can be reformulated as
B∆yt = Π∗yt−1 + Γ∗
1∆yt−1 + · · · + Γ∗
p−1∆yt−p+1 + Rut ,
(2.5)

58
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
where Π∗= −B(In−Pp
j=1 Aj) = and Γ∗
k = −Pp
j=k+1 BAj for k = 1, . . . , p−1. In
this formulation the long run behaviour of the shocks is determined by the matrix
Π∗, while the short run dynamics are governed by the matrices Γ∗
1, . . . , Γ∗
p−1.
Let ∆eyt and eyt−1 denote the residual vectors from the regressions of ∆yt and
yt−1 on ∆yt−1, . . . , ∆yt−p+1. If there are no restrictions on the short run parameters
Γ∗
1, . . . , Γ∗
p−1 we may concentrate the system as
B∆eyt = Π∗eyt−1 + Reut ,
(2.6)
which results from replacing Γ∗
1, . . . , Γ∗
p by least-squares estimates.
For notational convenience we reformulate model (2.5) as
B∆yt = Π∗yt−1 + Cxt−1 + Rut ,
where C = [Γ∗
1, . . . , Γp−1, C∗
p−1] and xt−1 = [∆y′
t−1, . . . , ∆y′
t−p+1]′. It is assumed
that ut is white noise with ut ∼N(0, In). The log-likelihood function of the model
is
L(B, C, R) = const + (T −p) ln |det(BR−1)|
(2.7)

subject to the restrictions:
Q1vec(B) = h1
(2.8)
Q2vec(R) = h2
(2.9)
Q3vec(Ψ) = h3 .
(2.10)
where the (2.10) implies restrictions on the long run eﬀect of the structural shocks.
In general, the maximization of (2.7) under the constraints (2.8) – (2.10) is
a computationally demanding problem. Even for the very simple model of Blan-
chard and Quah (1989), there exist multiple solutions and there are points in
the parameter space, where the log-likelihood function is undeﬁned. In particular
the latter problem occurs when the matrix B or R is singular and convergence
problems can arise in the neigbourhood of singular matrices.

2.4. ESTIMATION
59
If there are no restrictions on the long run impact matrix Ψ, the maximation
problem can be simpliﬁed by “concentrating out” the parameters in C. Setting
the derivative with respect to C equal to zero gives
bC =

The likelihood function corresponds to a “concentrated model” given by
B∆eyt = Π∗eyt−1 + Reut .
(2.11)
Accordingly, the ML estimation of the concentrated system is equivalent to the
maximization of (2.7).
The concentration with respect to C is not possible in systems with restrictions
on the long run eﬀect on ut and in other cases where C is restricted. In the next
section, a convenient representation is suggested, which allows the inclusion of
long run restrictions.
Instead of the ML estimation of the system, other estimation principles may
be adopted. The Minimum Distance (MD) estimation ﬁrst estimates the reduced
form parameters θ =vec(A1, . . . , Ap, Σ) and then obtains structural estimates of
the vector of structural parameters λ by solving the problem
λMD = argmin
λ

(2.12)

CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
subject to the restrictions (2.8) – (2.10), where bθ denotes the vector of the esti-
mated reduced form parameters (cf. Watson 1995). The matrix Vθ denotes the
asymptotic covariance matrix of the estimator bθ. The function θ = F(λ) relates
the reduced form parameters to the structural parameters. This function is the
vectorized analog of the two matrix functions

(In −A1 −· · · −Ap)−1B−1R
subject to the constraints (2.8) – (2.10). The estimation procedure based on (2.12)
is asymptotically equivalent to the ML estimation.
Furthermore, a GMM procedure can be adopted. The assumption that the
structural shocks are uncorrelated gives rise to the following (n −1)n/2 moment
conditions:
E(uitujt) = 0
for i < j ,
(2.13)
subject to the constraints (2.8) – (2.10), where ut = [u1t, . . . , unt]′ is given by
ut = B−1R(yt −A1yt−1 −· · · −Apyt−p) .
The GMM estimate is obtained by minimizing the distance function

obtained by replacing W by the identity matrix.
If the errors are i.i.d.
and
normally distributed, the GMM estimator is asymptotically equivalent to the ML
estimator. However, if the errors are non-normal or heteroscedastic, the GMM
estimator is asymptotically more eﬃcient than the (pseudo) ML estimator.
2.5
A latent variables framework
Assume that the matrices Γ∗
1, . . . , Γ∗
p−1 in (2.5) are not subject to restrictions so
that the model can be represented as
B∆eyt = Π∗eyt−1 + Rut,
(2.14)
where ∆eyt and eyt−1 denote the residual vectors from the regressions of ∆yt and
yt−1 on ∆yt−1, . . . , ∆yt−p+1. For convenience we drop the tildes and consider the
VAR[1] model.
To derive the latent variable representation we pre-multiply (2.14) by R−1
yielding
R−1B∆yt
=
R−1Π∗yt−1 + ut
=
−Ψ−1yt−1 + ut.
Using Ψ = −Π∗−1R the two sets of latent variables are deﬁned as
ξy
t
=
R−1B∆yt,
(2.15)
ξx
t
=
−Ψ−1yt−1.
(2.16)
Using these variables the system can simply be written as
ξy
t = ξx
t + ut.
(2.17)
The measurement equations (2.15) and (2.16) relate the latent variables to the
observed variables, whereas the system equations (2.17) specify the relationship
between the latent variables. The problem with (2.15) is that the equation is non-
linear in the structural parameters. To avoid such complications it is convenient
to introduce another set of latent variables deﬁned by the measurement equation

62
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
∆yt = ξz
t and, thus, from (2.15) the corresponding system equation is Rξy
t = Bξz
t .

This is the conventional formulation of Linear Structural Relations (LISREL) as
suggested by J¨oreskog (1969). The matrix B is normalized to have ones on the
leading diagonal. Note that the vector of latent variables ξz
t is a linear combi-
nation of ξy
t and, therefore, no additional measurement equations are required.2
Furthermore, if B = In we can neglect ξz
t and a LV model can be formulated with
(2.17) as the set of system equations.
The main advantage of formulating the structural VAR as a LV model of the
LISREL type is that the system is formulated linearly in the parameters of interest
B, R, Ψ. Such a system can conveniently be estimated and tested using widely
used software like the LISREL package by J¨oreskog and S¨orbom (1993).
2.6
Imposing long run restrictions
So far we have assumed that the vector yt has a stationary representation. In this
section the case that the lag polynomial A(L) has some roots on the unit circle is
considered and, thus, the shocks may have a permanent eﬀect on the time series.
The ﬁrst model that introduces information on the long run behaviour is the
often cited paper by Blanchard and Quah (1989). In this paper it is assumed that
one variable (output) is I(1), whereas the second variable (the unemployment rate)
2To implement such a system into the LISREL program, one speciﬁes the ﬁrst set of mea-
surement equations as ∆yt = ξz
t + Kξy
t and imposes the restriction K = 0.

2.6. IMPOSING LONG RUN RESTRICTIONS
63
is I(0). For the identiﬁcation of the shocks it is assumed that the demand shock
has a transitory eﬀect on output (that is its eﬀect tends to zero with an increasing
time horizon), whereas supply shocks may eﬀect output permanently. Crowder
(1995) demonstrates that this model can be written as a special cointegrated
system with the cointegration vector β = [0, 1]′.3
The Blanchard-Quah model was extended to systems with more then two
variables by King et al. (1991). Further developments of this kind of models are
discussed in Levtchenkova, Pagan and Robertson (1998).
Contemporaneous identiﬁcation of the shocks. While cointegration among
the variables imposes restrictions on the long run relationship between the system
variables, the ﬁrst class of models assumes that the structural shocks are identiﬁed
by restrictions on R and B.
Accordingly, the structural shocks are identiﬁed
by their contemporaneous relationship instead of their long run eﬀects on the
variables. An example is the empirical model of Clarida and Gertler (1996).
Assume that the cointegrating vectors are known so that the error correction
terms can be constructed as wt = β′yt. The structural system is written as
B∆yt = α∗wt−1 +
p−1
X
k=1
Γ∗
k∆yt−k + Rut ,
(2.18)
where α∗= Bα. Since α is assumed to be unrestricted, so is α∗. Hence, we
are able to “partial out” the unrestricted coeﬃcient matrices α∗and Γ∗
1, . . . , Γ∗
p−1
by regressing ∆yt on wt−1, ∆yt−1, . . . , ∆yt−p+1. Let eεt denote the corresponding
vector of residuals. Then, the structural system is transformed into
Beεt = Reut .
(2.19)
It follows that the only diﬀerence from the original SVAR model is that the struc-
tural model is formulated by using the residuals from the VECM representation
(1.12) instead of the unrestricted VAR residuals.
3However, Crowder (1995) is in error when claiming that α′
⊥is (a multiple of) [0, 1] (p.236).
Such a restriction would imply that no lagged Ut enters the output equation. This, however, is an
additional restriction not entailed in the original model. Since the BQ-Model is just identiﬁed,
there is no such over-identiﬁcation restriction to be tested as suggested by Crowder.

64
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
Permanent and transitory shocks. To accommodate a structural interpreta-
tion of the long run behaviour of the system, the shocks are classiﬁed as “perma-
nent” and “transitory”. While a permanent shock has a long run eﬀect on the
future level of at least one variable, all impulse response functions with respect to
a transitory shock die out as the lag horizon tends to inﬁnity.
In a system with cointegration rank r, there are n−r permanent and r transi-
tory shocks. As shown, e.g., in Johansen (1994), the vector of permanent shocks
can be represented as up
t = α′
⊥εt. The vector of transitory (or “cyclical”) shocks
can be represented as uc
t = γ′εt, where the columns of the n × r matrix γ are
linearly independent of the columns of α⊥. In the structural form (2.2) the shocks
are related to the innovations by
ut =
"
up
t
uc
t
#
= R−1Bεt .
(2.20)
In order to impose the restriction that the ﬁrst n−r elements of ut are permanent
shocks, the upper (n −r) × n block of the matrix (R−1B) must be orthogonal to
α. Furthermore, let R be lower block-triangular so that the upper right (n−r)×r
block is zero. In this case, the permanent shocks result from setting the upper
block of B equal to α⊥. Accordingly, shocks are restricted to have a permanent
eﬀect by setting the corresponding rows of Γ = R−1B equal to zero.
This gives rise to the following estimation procedure. Let ∆eyt and eyt−1 denote
the residuals from a regression of ∆yt and yt−1 on ∆yt−1, . . . , ∆yt−p, respectively.
Letting ξy
t = R−1B∆eyt = Γ ewt−1 + eut with ewt−1 = β′eyt−1, the corresponding LV
model is given by

where the permanent shocks result from setting the corresponding rows of Γ equal
to zero.
This framework is more general than the estimation method suggested by
King et al. (1991) that is based on a just identiﬁed system with a triangular
identiﬁcation of the transitory shocks (see Section 3.8.3 for more details).
Linear restrictions on the long run eﬀect of the shocks. If the structural
model implies restrictions on the magnitude of the long run eﬀect, a LV represen-
tation of the LISREL type does not seem possible in the general case. However,
for B = In the LV framework can be used as follows.
Following Warne (1990) the cointegrated system is transformed to a statio-
nary VAR using the vector of transformed variables zt = [y′
tβ, ∆y′
tγ]′, where γ
is some ﬁxed n × (n −r) matrix linearly independent of β. The vector zt has
a stationary VAR(p) representation and, thus, the usual SVAR framework can
be used. Let Ψz denote the long run impulse response of the integrated series
st = Pt
j=1 zj = [Pt
j=1 y′
jβ, y′
tγ]′ with respect to the structural shocks. From the
relationship between yt and zt we can deduce the long run response of st from the
impact matrix Ψz. Let
D(L) =
"
Ir

(1 −L)In−r
#
and
D(L) =
"
(1 −L)Ir
0
0
In−r
#
such that D(L)D(L) = (1 −L)In. Furthermore, let Q = [β, γ]′. The relationship
between zt and yt is given by
zt = D(L)Qyt .
(2.21)
Multiplying with Q−1D(L) gives
∆yt = Q−1D(L)zt .
(2.22)
It follows that the long run impulse response of yt denoted by Ψy is given by
Ψy = Q−1D(1)Ψz
(2.23)
and, thus, linear restrictions on Ψy imply linear restrictions on Ψz.
That is,
the structural form of the cointegrated VAR can be estimated by using the LV
representation for zt as considered in Section 3.5.

66
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
It is important to notice that the matrix Q is treated as ﬁxed. Since β can
be estimated super-consistently, one may use an estimate of β without aﬀecting
the asymptotic properties of the estimation procedure. The choice of γ is more
problematical.
Of course it is possible to select the values of γ arbitrarily as
a block from the identity matrix, for example.
However, if there is no prior
information about the cointegrating space, it may be that some vectors of γ fall in
the cointegrating space and, therefore, the matrix Q is not invertible. In practice
one should therefore test whether the column vectors of γ fall in the cointegrating
space by using, e.g., Johansen’s (1991) LR tests.
2.7
Inference on impulse responses
The impulse response ϕh(i, j) measures the eﬀect of the j’th shock on the i’th
variable h periods ahead (cf. L¨utkepohl 1991, Sec. 2.3.2). Formally the impulse
response function is deﬁned as
ϕh(i, j) = ∂E(yi,t+h|Yt−1, ujt)
∂ujt
,
(2.24)
where Yt−1 = {yt−1, yt−2, . . .}. The impulse responses can be computed from the
MA representation of the system. It is convenient to introduce the companion
form of the VAR model:
zt = Mzt−1 + νt ,

From this representation the original time series vector is obtained as yt = J′zt,
where J is a selection matrix deﬁned as J′ = [In, 0, . . . , 0]. Using the companion
form, the MA representation can be written as

Let Φh denote the impulse response matrix with typical element ϕh(i, j). From
the MA representation this matrix results as
Φh = J′M hJB−1R .
(2.30)
The impulse response can therefore be represented as a nonlinear function of the
structural parameters:
ϕh = vec(Φh) = f h
ϕ(θ) ,
(2.31)
where θ =vec([A1, . . . , Ap], B, R) ≡[θ′

L¨utkepohl (1990) derives the asymptotic distribution of the estimated impulse
response function for the VAR model with triangular identiﬁcation scheme by
using the Delta method. This method can also be used to derive the asymptotic
distribution of the estimated impulse responses in the structural model:
bϕh = f h
ϕ(bθ) .
(2.32)

CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
The Delta method is based on the mean value expansion:
bϕh = ϕh + ∇f h
ϕ(¯θ)(bθ −θ) ,
(2.33)
where ¯θ lies on the intersection of θ and bθ, and ∇f h
ϕ(¯θ) denotes the derivative
∂f h
ϕ(θ)/∂θ′ evaluated at ¯θ. To derive the asymptotic distribution of the estimated
impulse responses, the derivatives must be computed. For the case R = In and a
structural matrix B with the restriction Q1vec(B) = h1, the derivative is derived
in Vlaar (1999). The following lemma provides the derivative of f h
ϕ(θ) for the case
that the variables are not cointegrated and no long run restrictions are used to
identify the parameters.
LEMMA 2.1 Let yt be generated by the structural model given by (2.3) with the
parameter vector θ = [θ′
1, b∗′, r∗′]′ and θ1 = vec(A1, . . . , Ap). Then, the derivative
is given by
∇f h

Proof: The result follows from (2.30) and eq. (13) in Sec. 10.5.1 of L¨utkepohl
(1996) and is similar to the result given in L¨utkepohl (1990, Prop. 1).
From eq. (1) in Sec. 10.6.1 of L¨utkepohl (1996) it follows that
∂f h
ϕ(bθ)
∂vec(B)′ = −R′B′−1 ⊗J′M hJB−1 .

Using ∂vec(R)/∂r∗′ = Q∗

0 follows easily. ■
If the structural model is subject to long run restrictions, the derivative is much
more complicated. The problem is that the respective restrictions are nonlinear:
Q3vec

(In −A1 −· · · −Ap)−1B

= Q3

In ⊗(In −A1 −· · · −Ap)−1
vec(B) = h3 .
For the estimated model this restriction takes the form:
bQ3vec bB = h3 ,
(2.34)
where bQ3 = Q3[In ⊗(In −bA1 −· · · −bAp)−1]. Vlaar (1999) calls (2.34) a “stochas-
tic restriction”. He notes that the software packages Malcolm in Rats (see
Mosconi 1998) treats this restriction like a usual linear restriction by neglecting
the stochastic nature of the matrix bQ3. Vlaar (1999) therefore derives the correct
asymptotic distribution by taking into account the distribution of bQ3. The result-
ing formulae are however rather messy and it is therefore appealing to make use
of the reformulation used to derive the latent variable representation.
Following Johansen (1988) the system can be represented as
∆yt
=
Πyt−p + eΓ1∆yt−1 + · · · + eΓp−1∆yt−p+1 + εt
=
−B−1RΨ−1yt−p + eΓ1∆yt−1 + · · · + eΓp−1∆yt−p+1 + B−1Rut ,
where eΓj = −In + A1 + · · · + Aj for j = 1, . . . , p −1. The diﬀerence to the form
used in (1.12) is that here the levels are lagged by p periods instead of a single
lag. It is assumed that eΓj are unrestricted matrices for j = 1, . . . , p −1. This
model can be written in companion form as in (2.25), where

The impulse response matrix with respect to h periods results as
Φh = J′M hJB−1R .
The important advantage of this representation is that long run restrictions can
be written as linear restrictions on Ψ:
Q3vec(Ψ) = h3 or vec(Ψ) = h∗

The derivative can be obtained in the same manner as in the case without long

−→N(0, ∇f h
ϕ(θ)Σθ∇f h
ϕ(θ)′) ,
where ∇f h
ϕ(θ) is given in Lemma 2.1 or Lemma 2.2.
Proof: The proof of this theorem immediately follows from the mean value
expansion given in (2.33). ■
It is important to notice that the assumptions (i) and (ii) in Theorem 2.1
may fail in practice. As pointed out by L¨utkepohl (1990), the derivative may
be zero for some particular values of the structural parameters. This problem
already occurs in a univariate model (cf. Benkwitz et al. 2000). In the simple
AR(1) model yt = αyt−1 + εt the estimated impulse response is bϕh = bαh. The
derivative is ∇f h
ϕ(θ) = hαh−1. Obviously, the derivative is zero for α = 0 and
h ≥2 and, thus, the impulse responses have a nonstandard limiting distribution
and converge with the rate T h/2 instead of
√
T. Benkwitz et al. (2000) discuss
alternative methods to overcome this problem.
Assumption (ii) of Theorem 2.1 may be violated if the process has roots on or
inside the unit circle. In this case some parameters have a nonstandard limiting
distribution. Again it is useful to consider the simplest case of a univariate AR(1)
model. If α = 1, the least-squares estimator is distributed as
T(bα −1) ⇒
R 1
0 W(r)dW(r)
R 1
0 W(r)2dr
and, obviously, the impulse responses fail to be asymptotically normally dis-
tributed for all h. Phillips (1998) shows that for h →∞the impulse responses are
not even consistent as h/T →λ for T →∞and λ > 0, that is, if the lag horizon
of the impulse responses are large relative to the sample size. This problem can
however be resolved by using the VECM representation instead of an unrestricted
VAR in levels (Phillips 1998 and Vlaar 1999).
Sims and Zha (1994) argue hat classical (frequentist) conﬁdence intervals can
be poor measures of the ignorance about estimated impulse response functions in
small samples. First, using bootstrap methods yields a conﬁdence interval which

2.7. INFERENCE ON IMPULSE RESPONSES
73
is based on “an average across informative and uninformative samples” (Sims and
Zha 1994, p.6). In contrast, a Bayesian conﬁdence interval always conditions on
the actual sample and, thus, provides a measure of ignorance by using the data
at hand. Second, in small samples conﬁdence intervals often exhibit a substantial
asymmetry. This important feature cannot be represented by using an asymptotic
approach based on a normal limiting distribution.
Most of the empirical studies using SVAR models neglect possible information
on the long run relationships among the variables. To address this question in
more detail, assume that yt is generated by a cointegrated model with a VECM
representation given in (1.12). Engle and Yoo (1991) show that the information
matrix of the likelihood function assuming normal innovations is block diagonal
with respect to θ1 = vec(β), θ2 = vec(α, Γ1, . . . , Γp−1) and θ3 = vec(Σ). Accord-
ingly, the estimates bΣ (and therefore bB and bR) are asymptotically independent of
the estimates of Γ1, . . . , Γp−1, Π and β. It follows that the structural parameters
in B and R are not aﬀected by imposing the rank restrictions on Π as long as Π
is estimated consistently.
Since the impulse responses involve the parameter matrices B, R and Π, this
result is not suﬃcient to conclude that the distribution of the impulse response
function is not aﬀected by the cointegration properties. Nevertheless, it can be
shown that the impulse response matrix at a ﬁxed lag horizon is indeed asympto-
tically the same whether an unrestricted VAR in levels or an appropriate VECM
is used to estimate the impulse responses. This result is based on the following
lemma (see also Phillips and Durlauf 1986 and Sims et al.
(1990) for similar
results).
LEMMA 2.3 Assume that yt is generated by a cointegrated VAR. Let eΠ denote
the unrestricted least-squares estimator of Π and bΠ is the ML estimator conditional
on the true cointegration rank r. Then, eΠ = bΠ + op(T −1/2).
Proof: To facilitate the notation, a VAR(1) model is used to demonstrated the
result. The extension to VAR(p) models is straightforward.
Let Υ = [T −1/2β, T −1β⊥]′. In a VAR(1) model the unrestricted least-squares

and, thus, the required result follows. ■
It may be surprising to learn that imposing the correct rank restriction on
the matrix Π yields no gain in eﬃciency for estimating the impulse responses.
The reason is that the limiting behaviour of the impulse responses at a ﬁnite lag
horizon is dominated by the limiting behaviour of the short run parameters.

2.7. INFERENCE ON IMPULSE RESPONSES
75
THEOREM 2.2 Let yt be generated by a cointegrated VAR with cointegration
rank r and a VECM representation as in (1.12). Then, the asymptotic distribution
of the estimated impulse response at a ﬁnite lag horizon h is the same whether the
impulse response is estimated from an unrestricted VAR instead or a VECM with
cointegration rank r.
Proof: The VECM model has a companion form according to (2.25) with

The impulse responses result as
Φh = J′M hJBR−1
or
ϕh = f h
ϕ(θ) ,
where θ =vec(eΓ1, . . . , eΓp−1, Π, B, R). Using Lemma (2.3) it follows that bθ = eθ +
op(T −1/2) so that under the conditions of Theorem 2.1
bϕh(i, j)
=
fϕ(bθ)
=
fϕ(eθ) + op(T −1/2)
and, thus, bϕh(i, j) and eϕh(i, j) have the same limiting distributions. ■
This result implies that information on the long run relationship of the vari-
ables does not help to improve the short run impulse responses. However, Clarida
and Gertler (1996) claim that in small samples the estimates may be improved
by imposing the correct cointegration rank. Furthermore, as shown by Phillips
(1998) the estimates of the impulse responses deteriorate with an increasing lag
horizon and become insigniﬁcant if the lag horizon grows as fast as the sample
size. Hence, in practice it may be advantageous to use a VECM representation
with a proper cointegration rank to estimate the impulse responses.

76
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
2.8
Empirical applications
In this section we consider three structural models that can be seen to be “repre-
sentative” for many recent applications using SVAR models. The ﬁrst example is
related to the early contributions by Sims (1981, 1986). The simple structure of
the model allows the application of a convenient instrumental variable estimator.
The model suggested by Blanchard and Quah (1989) achieves identiﬁcation by
imposing assumptions on the long run eﬀect of the shocks. This model is ex-
tended by King et al. (1991) in order to identify n −r permanent shocks in a
cointegrated system. For the latter two models point estimates of the structural
parameters can be obtained analytically by exploiting the relationship between
the parameters of the structural and the reduced form. However, standard errors
of the estimates are not available by using this approach.
The fourth example is an over-identiﬁed structural model which was recently
suggested by Swanson and Granger (1997).
This model is motivated using a
causal interpretation based on graph theory. The LV framework provides eﬃ-
cient estimation and inference procedures for estimating and testing such kind of
models.
2.8.1
A simple IS-LM model
To illustrate the “ﬁrst generation” SVAR models advocated by Sims (1981),
Bernanke (1986) and others, a traditional IS-LM model is estimated using quar-
terly U.S. data from 1970(i) to 1997(iv). The output Yt is measured by real GDP,
Mt is the monetary base as computed by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
divided by the GDP deﬂator, and it is the 3-month interbank interest rate.
Let εY
t , εi
t and εM

denote the innovations of the VAR equations for Yt, it and
Mt. The model considered in Pagan (1995) is given by

where t-values are given in parentheses. The estimate of the coeﬃcient α is in-
signiﬁcant and positive so that we do not obtain a reasonable estimate of the IS
equation. The parameters of the LM curve have the correct sign but the estimate
of β1 is statistically insigniﬁcant.
Nevertheless, we compute the impulse response functions to analyse the im-
pact of structural shocks on the system variables. The respective graphs are given
in Figure 3.1. It should be mentioned that the LISREL package does not provide
conﬁdence intervals for the impulse responses so that it is diﬃcult to assess the
economic relevance of the results. With this limitation Figure 3.1 a) shows that
in response to an upward shift of the IS curve output increases immediately but
the increase dies out within six years. A positive money demand shock (LM) is
equivalent to an increase in the interest rate and from Figure 3.1 b) it can be
seen that output decreases gradually with a minimum after two years. The im-
pulse response function shows that the small positive correlation between output
and interest rates resulting from the estimated IS curve is merely a short run
phenomenon and at longer horizons the relationship is strong and negative as
expected from economic theory.
The negative response of output following a positive money supply shock is
somewhat puzzling. From theory we expect that an increase in real money bal-
ances yields an expansive eﬀect on output. However, the impulse response function

given in Figure 3.1 c) implies that a positive money supply shock produces a drop
in output after roughly 2 years. Although the size of the eﬀect is moderate, this
result suggests that monetary policy shocks are not measured appropriately by in-
novations in the monetary base. Indeed, recent empirical work demonstrates that
monetary policy in the U.S. is more accurately measured by innovations in the
Federal Funds Rate or a combination of a narrow monetary base and short-term
interest rates (Bernanke and Mihov 1997).
A positive shift in the IS curve increases interest rates with a maximal re-
sponse at two years (Figure 3.1 d), whereas real money decreases gradually with
a minimum at three years (Figure 3.1 g). These eﬀects are predicted by the IS-
LM model. Similarly, a LM shock leads to an increase in interest rates and a

80
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
decrease in real money (see Figures 3.1 e and 3.1 h) which is also predicted by the
theoretical model. Finally, a positive money supply shock leads to an immediate
drop in interest rates (Figure 3.1 f) and a gradual increase in real money. This
eﬀect is known as the “liquidity eﬀect” and is also an important consequence of
the standard IS-LM model (e.g. Hamilton 1997).
To assess the importance of the three diﬀerent shocks for the system variables,
the forecast error variances of the variables are decomposed with respect to the
shocks. Since the shocks are orthogonal, their contribution can be measured as
a fraction of the total forecast error variance. The results for diﬀerent forecast
horizons are presented in Table 3.1. It turns out that the money supply shock
contributes only a small fraction to the forecast error variance of output. Once
again this result conﬁrms that the innovation in money does not seem to be an
accurate indicator for monetary policy. IS shocks clearly dominate the short run
behaviour of the output series but with respect to a longer forecast horizon, IS
shocks become less important. Finally, money demand shocks play a minor role
in the short run. However with an increasing forecast horizon, the LM shocks
become more and more important. The relative contribution of the shocks to the
forecast error variance of interest rates and real money can be interpreted in a
similar manner.
Summing up, the results demonstrate that even such a simple model for the
U.S. economy is able to produce reasonable results although some ﬁndings are at
variance with our preconceptions emerging from the basic version of an IS-LM
model. In fact, it is often encountered in practice that some aspects of the SVAR
model are inconsistent with theoretical reasoning. For example, in several studies
for the U.S., monetary policy shocks produce results consistent with common
priors about the qualitative eﬀects of monetary policy on output and prices, but
produce a so-called “liquidity puzzle”, that is, expansive monetary policy increases
interest rates (see, e.g., Fung and Kasumovich 1998). However, such a result does
not demonstrate the general failure of the SVAR approach. Rather, such ﬁndings
give an indication of the direction in which the model may be improved.

2.8.2
The Blanchard-Quah model
Based on a simple economic model, Blanchard and Quah (1989) identify supply
shocks to have persistent eﬀects on output whereas demand shocks are transitory.
That is, in a VAR model with yt = [∆Yt, Ut]′, where Yt denotes the log of output
and Ut is the unemployment rate, the vector of structural shocks ut = [us
t, ud
t ]′ is
identiﬁed by setting the (1,2) element of the long run impact matrix Ψ equal to
zero. Furthermore, we let Ω= I, so that the shocks are normalized to have unit
variance.
The structural form is related to the reduced form as
ΨΨ′ = (I −A1 −· · · −Ap)−1Σ(I −A′
1 −· · · −A′
p)−1 .
Since Ψ is assumed to be lower triangular, it can be obtained from a Choleski
decomposition of the matrix (I −A1 −· · · −Ap)−1Σ(I −A′
1 −· · · −A′
p)−1. It
is important to note, however, that this computation implies that the diagonal
elements of Ψ are strictly positive. This additional identiﬁcation restriction will
be discussed below.
The Blanchard-Quah model can also be estimated by using the LV represen-
tation that has the simple form:
Measurement equations:


∆eyt

System equations:

where ∆eyt and eyt−1 denote the ﬁrst step residuals obtained from a regression of
∆yt and yt−1 on the lags of ∆yt and the deterministic terms of the system. The
(1, 2) element of Ψ is set to zero.
With respect to the discussion in Section 3.6 it is also interesting to compare
the ﬁndings with the corresponding results using a cointegration approach. Since
Ut is assumed to be stationary, it follows that β = [0, 1]′ and the error correction

An estimate of α = [α1, α2]′ is obtained by OLS and an orthogonal complement of
this vector is α⊥= [α2, −α1]′. Accordingly, an estimator of the matrix Q deﬁned
in Section 3.6 can be constructed as
Q =

To compute R, let P be the Choleski factor of (QΣQ′). Then, as shown in Section
3.6, R can be obtained as R = Q−1P.
To estimate the system, we ﬁrst employ the software package LISREL 8.12a
to estimate the latent variable representation. The maximum likelihood estimates
result as

where the absolute t-values are given in parentheses. The estimates are numeri-
cally identical to the estimates obtained by applying the computational method
suggested by Blanchard and Quah (1989). However, the t-statistics are not avail-
able by using the latter technique.
It may be interesting to note that the “supply shock” has an insigniﬁcant
contemporaneous impact (|t| = 0.237) on output growth.
Thus, the demand
shock is approximately the innovation of the output growth equation.

Figure 2.2: Impulse responses for the Blanchard-Quah model

84
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
In Figure 3.2 the impulse response functions with respect to the structural
shocks are presented. The impulse response function are very similar to the ones
obtained by Blanchard and Quah (1989) and a careful economic interpretation of
the ﬁgures is given in their paper. The 90% conﬁdence intervals are computed by
1000 Monte Carlo draws of the estimated reduced form and normally distributed
errors. Comparing our conﬁdence sets with the bootstrap intervals presented in
Blanchard and Quah (1989) reveals that their conﬁdence bands are much more
asymmetric than ours.
As argued by Sims and Zha (1994), this is due to an
improper bootstrap algorithm used by Blanchard and Quah (1989).
In practical applications, the cointegration approach yields diﬀerent estimates
of the structural parameters even if maximum likelihood techniques are used. This
is due to the diﬀerent model representation used in this framework. If some vari-
ables are diﬀerenced, the degree of the corresponding lag polynomials is reduced
by one and, thus, the VAR equations have a diﬀerent lag order. It is possible
to account for such diﬀerences by using a VAR representation with diﬀerent lag
orders for the variables.
The eﬃcient estimation of such systems is, however,
much more complicated than an unrestricted VAR so that we do not consider
such modiﬁcations in what follows.
For the Blanchard-Quah model the cointegration approach yields the estimate
bRCI =

which is – in absolute values – not far away from the estimates using the LISREL
approach.
2.8.3
The KPSW model
A simple example of a cointegrated system with a structural identiﬁcation of the
shocks is provided by King, Plosser, Stock and Watson (KPSW) (1991). Stan-
dard RBC models with permanent technology shocks imply that the logarithm of
private output (qt), consumption (ct) and investment (it) are I(1) processes with
the cointegration relations ct −qt ∼I(0) and it −qt ∼I(0). Since β⊥(the or-
thogonal complement of β) is a vector with identical elements, the common trend

where the polynomial eC(L) = eC0 + eC1L + eC2L2 + · · · has all roots outside the
complex unit circle. It is seen that the permanent shock has an identical long run
impact on the variables.
To achieve a structural identiﬁcation, King et al.
(1991) assume that the
ﬁrst shock (u1t) is permanent and the remaining two shocks (u2t, u3t) are transi-
tory. Furthermore, the shocks are mutually uncorrelated with unit variance, i.e.,
E(utu′
t) = I3. These assumptions are suﬃcient to identify the permanent shock
but are not suﬃcient for the identiﬁcation of the transitory shocks. The identi-
ﬁcation of u1t follows immediately from the fact that in this case α⊥is a 3 × 1
vector and, therefore, u1t = α′
⊥εt/
p
α′
⊥Σα⊥. However, to identify the transitory
shocks an additional restriction is needed.
King et al.
(1991) assume that the transitory shocks enter the system re-
cursively, as in the triangular identiﬁcation scheme implied by using a Choleski
decomposition. Such a procedure is obtained by letting R be lower triangular and
B =



b2

.
Since the ﬁrst shock is assumed to be permanent, the ﬁrst row [1, b1, b2] must be
orthogonal to the columns of the matrix α. Furthermore the (1,1) element of B
is normalized to unity in order to achieve identiﬁcation of the (1,1) element of R.
The matrix Γ = R−1Bα is a 3 × 2 matrix with zeros in the ﬁrst row (see Section
3.6). This model has {6, 2, 4} unknown parameters for {R, B, Γ} and, thus, the
structural model has the same number of parameters as the reduced form.
For the empirical application we use U.S. real national income account vari-
ables for 1960(i) through 1988(iv), so that the data and the sample period are sim-
ilar to King et al. (1991). The variable qt is the per capita private Gross National

Product (GNP less government purchases of goods and services), ct measures per
capita Private Consumption Expenditures and it is measured by per capita Gross
Private Fixed Investments.4 As in King et al. (1991) all computations are based
on a VAR(6) representation.
Table 3.2 presents the results of Johansen’s (1991) trace test for the cointe-
gration rank. An unrestricted linear time trend is included and the corresponding
critical values of Perron and Campbell (1993) are applied. The hypothesis that
the three series are not cointegrated (r = 0) can be rejected at a signiﬁcance level
of 0.10. Furthermore, the hypothesis that the cointegration rank is r = 1 or r = 2
cannot be rejected. Although this is only a weak empirical support we follow King
et al. (1991) and choose the cointegration rank r = 2 in what follows. Using the
LR test suggested by Johansen and Juselius (1992) the theoretical cointegration
vectors β1 = [−1, 1, 0]′ and β1 = [−1, 0, −1]′ cannot be rejected at a critical value
of 0.05.

Figure 2.3: Responses w.r.t. the permanent shock
In Figure 3.3 the impulse response functions with respect to the permanent shock
are depicted.
In all, they have a similar shape as those presented in King et
al. (1991). However, the investment response is much more pronounced than
the respective response presented in the original paper. This seems to be due to
diﬀerences in the data construction.
An alternative way to formulate the structural model is to adopt a structural
model for the transformed set of variables zt = [ct −qt, it −qt, ∆qt]′. The corre-

where a is the long run impact of the permanent shock. The zeros in the last row of
Ψz result from the assumption that the second and the third shock are transitory.
In order to identify the transitory shocks we need an additional restriction. Again
one may set the (2,3) element of R equal to zero. However, one should note that
the matrix R in the representation for zt is not identical to the matrix R of the
former model for ∆yt.

2.8. EMPIRICAL APPLICATIONS
89
Since the (concentrated) reduced form implies 15 parameters and [Ψz, R] con-
tains 7+9=16 parameters we need an additional restriction. In King et al. (1991)
and the cointegration approach considered above the transitory shocks are uniquely
obtained by using a Choleski decomposition. An equivalent identiﬁcation is ob-
tained using a matrix with a structure like
R =

r13
r21
r22




,
where r22 and r33 are positive numbers. Here, identiﬁcation is achieved by assum-
ing that the third structural shock is uncorrelated with the second innovation.
The kind of identiﬁcation restriction for the transitory shocks does not, however,
aﬀect the construction of the permanent shock.
Maximizing the likelihood function of the LV model, the long run impact of
the permanent shock is estimated as 0.855 with an estimated standard deviation
of 0.181. The corresponding estimate from the cointegration approach (0.617, see
above) is in the range of two times the standard deviation.
In the present application we use the transformation matrix

According to (2.22) the impulse response function (IRF) of qt with respect to the
permanent shocks is identical to the cumulated IRF of ∆qt with respect to the
permanent shock. The IRF of ct is equal to the sum of the cumulated IRF of
ct −qt with respect to the permanent shock and the IRF of ct −qt with respect to
the the ﬁrst transitory shock. The IRF of it is equal to the sum of the cumulated
IRF of ct −qt with respect to the permanent shock and the IRF of it −qt with
respect to the the second transitory shock.
From bB it is seen that the estimated permanent shock is proportional to
[1, 0.418, −0.3]εt. However, the parameter estimates are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from zero. Excluding the investment innovation gives a permanent shock with the

90
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
estimate 1.81 and a t-value of 3.56 for the coeﬃcient attached to the consumption
innovation. From these results it is obvious that the parameter estimates in bB
are highly correlated and a data consistent restriction can change the remaining
parameter estimates dramatically.
In all, this application demonstrates that the simple neoclassical growth model
seems to be perform well at least for the data used in King et al. (1991). The long
run response of consumption, investment and output to a permanent (technology)
shock is the same but the short run response of investment is much more cyclical
than the short run response of consumption. This is also predicted by standard
neoclassical models (e.g. Kydland and Prescott 1982).
2.8.4
The causal graph model of Swanson-Granger (1997)
In order to identify a causal structure for the innovations, Swanson and Granger
(1997) adopt a graph theoretical approach. Assume that a vector of uncorrelated
shocks ut = [u1t, . . . , unt]′ can be found such that the innovations of the (station-
ary) VAR are arranged as ε1t = u1t ; ε2t = a2ε1t + u2t ; · · · ; εnt = anεn−1,t + unt.
Such a structure can be represented by a causal graph as
ε1t
−→
ε2t
−→
· · ·
−→
εnt
↑
↑
↑
↑
u1t
u2t
· · ·
unt
(2.36)
The arrows are assumed to indicate a simple form of causal directionality (cf.
Swanson and Granger, 1997). It should be noted that this concept of causality is
diﬀerent from what is known as “Granger causality”. The latter concept implies
an ordering in time so that a cause must be prior to the eﬀect. The causal graph
approach is a way to formalize the notion of “instantaneous causality” discussed,
e.g., in L¨utkepohl (1993).
The causal ordering given in (2.36) implies that E(εitεkt|εjt) = 0 for any
i < j < k. Accordingly, Swanson and Granger (1997) suggest testing the par-
tial correlation between εit and εkt conditional on εjt in order to recover the
causal ordering empirically.
To motivate this concept consider the condition

2.8. EMPIRICAL APPLICATIONS
91
E(ε1tε3t|ε2t) = 0. From ε3t = a3ε2t +u3t and E(ε2tu3t) = 0 it follows that given ε2t
the variable ε1t does not help to “predict” ε3t. On the other hand, if a3 ̸= 0, then
the partial correlation between ε3t and ε2t conditional on ε1t is diﬀerent from zero
and, thus, ε2t provide additional information to predict ε3t. Hence, ε2t may be
seen as a cause of ε3t. It is important to note that the causal graph ε1t →ε2t →ε3t
implies the same restriction on the conditional expectation as ε3t →ε2t →ε1t and,
therefore, the direction of the graph is not identiﬁed.
This causality concept can be represented as a structural VAR by letting

and R = In. The corresponding LV representation is given by
Measurement equations:
eεt = ξy

System equations:

t = (I −B)ξy
t + ut .
It is easy to see that such a structural model implies (n −2)(n −1)/2 over-
identifying restrictions, which can be tested empirically by comparing the value
of the log likelihood function with the corresponding value of the unrestricted
VAR using the LR test statistic. This test avoids problems of the sequential test
procedure suggested in Swanson and Granger (1997).
As an application of this approach we consider a four-variate system for the
U.S. including the log of the money base M3 (M), log of real GNP (Y ), the 3-
month LIBOR interest rate (R) and the log of the implicit GNP deﬂator (P).
The data for M, Y and P are seasonally adjusted and is taken from the Main
Economic Indicator data base. The interest rate R is not seasonally adjusted and
taken from the IMF data base. All data run from 1970(i) through 1994(iv).

the cointegration rank including an unrestricted constant in VECM represen-
tation. The critical values correspond to a signiﬁcance value of 0.05 and are
taken from Osterwald-Lenum (1990).
The vector of time series is modeled using a cointegrated VAR including a
vector of constants in the error correction representation. Model selection crite-
ria like AIC and tests for serial correlation of the errors suggest that a VAR(2)
model is suﬃcient to render white noise errors. Table 3.3 presents Johansen’s
(1991) trace and maximum eigenvalue test statistics for the cointegration rank.
The results suggest that there are two cointegration relationships among the vari-
ables. Therefore, the residuals from the estimated VECM model are used for the
structural model of the form Beεt = eut, where B has the form as in (2.37).
Table 3.4 presents the results of the LR test of the over-identifying restrictions
implied by the corresponding causal graph. There exist 4! = 24 possible graphs.
However, since the direction of the graph is not identiﬁed, only 12 graphs are
considered. The “mirror graphs” yield the same values of the LR statistic, so
there is no point in reporting them. It turns out that only two causal graphs
are accepted at a signiﬁcance level of 0.05. Both graphs do not correspond well
with the type of transmission mechanism of monetary policy discussed in the
literature. The graphs imply that (real) eﬀects on output are “causally prior”
to the (nominal) eﬀects on prices, while theory usually conjectures the reverse
ordering. Since we only intend to give an illustration of the approach suggested by
Swanson and Granger (1997), we do not attempt to reconcile this ﬁnding with the

of the merits and pitfalls of this new approach is left for future research.

Problems with the SVAR approach
Identiﬁcation problems. In a critique of Blanchard and Quah (1989), Lippi
and Reichlin (1993) point out that a stationary VAR has an inﬁnite manifold
of diﬀerent MA representations. Among those, however, only one (the Wold or
fundamental representation) has the property that the determinant of the MA
polynomial has all its roots on or outside the unit circle. There are, however,
non-fundamental representations with roots inside the unit circle. The associated
white noise errors are linear combinations of current, past and future values of
yt. Lippi and Reichlin (1993) argue that such non-fundamental representations
usually cannot be ruled out a priori. Speciﬁcally, nonfundamental representations
can occur if the information space of the economic agents is diﬀerent from the
information space of the econometrician.
In a reply to this critique Blanchard and Quah (1993) admit that the limi-
tation to fundamental representations is somewhat arbitrary but that it cannot

94
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
be considered less plausible than alternative non-fundamental representations. In
fact, in most cases it is not possible to select the “correct” representation on
empirical grounds and it seems thus natural to select the most convenient one.
The Blanchard–Quah methodology formally decompose a set of time series into
certain orthogonal shocks with some prespeciﬁed properties. Whether such quan-
tities have the attached economic meaning of representing demand and supply
shifts cannot be decided empirically.
It merely provides one admissible inter-
pretation of the data which is generally not refutable as long as just identiﬁed
structures are considered.
Another important problem is that even if one conﬁnes oneself to the Wold
representation, the structural model need not be unique. The Blanchard-Quah
model provides a good example for illustrating the problems involved by the iden-
tiﬁcation of structural VARs. The reduced form is a bivariate VAR modeling the
unemployment rate and output growth and the two structural errors are inter-
preted as supply and demand shocks, where the eﬀect of the demand shocks on
the output measure is assumed to vanish in the long run (see Section 3.8.2).
Let rij, σij, cij denote the (i, j) elements of R, Σ = RR′ and C = Π−1. Then
the set of restrictions for the structural model is:
r2
11 + r2
12 = σ11
(2.38)
r2
21 + r2
22 = σ22
(2.39)
r21r11 + r22r12 = σ12
(2.40)
c11r12 + c12r22 = 0 .
(2.41)
It is easily seen that these restrictions identify the absolute value of the parameters
but are not suﬃcient to determine the sign of the parameter uniquely. Speciﬁcally,
if the matrix R(1) obeys the restrictions then also the matrix R(2) = −R(1) and

fulﬁll the above constraints. In this simple example it is obvious that a unique

representation is obtained if there are additional assumptions about the signs of
the diagonal elements of R. Indeed, this is the case if the Choleski decomposition
is applied for computing the structural parameters from the reduced form as in
Blanchard and Quah (1989). In models using R = I, identiﬁcation is usually
achieved by setting the diagonal elements of B equal to one.
Waggoner and Zha (1997) show that the normalization used to identify the
shocks is not only important for the interpretation of the model but also aﬀects
statistical inference in small samples.
A similar point is made by Pagan and
Robertson (1998) by using a diﬀerent perspective. To illustrate the problem, we
follow these authors and consider the model suggested by Gordon and Leeper
(1994):
MS :
mt = b12it + γ′
1x1t + us
t
MD :
it = b21mt + γ′
2x2t + ud
t ,
where us
t and ud
t represent money supply and money demand shocks, respectively.
The vectors x1t and x2t comprise further (exogenous) variables that are used
to identify the two equations. These variables are, however, inessential for our
reasoning and so we drop these variables for the ease of exposition.
The contemporary impulse responses are obtained as
"
1
b12
b21
1
#−1
=
1
1 −b21b12
"
1
−b12
−b21

#
.
(2.42)
Economic theory implies that b12 > 0 and b21 < 0 so that b21b12 is negative. In
ﬁnite samples there is a positive probability that for the estimates ˆb21ˆb12 > 1,
in particular, if b21 and b12 are estimated using “weak instruments” (Pagan and
Robertson 1998).
It follows that in ﬁnite samples there may be a substantial
probability that the impulse responses swich their sign. The resulting distribution
of the impulse responses therefore tends to have two diﬀerent modes and the
normal distribution yields a poor approximation to the actual distribution. Pagan
and Robertson (1998) show that this problem is in fact relevant in empirical
applications.
Waggoner and Zha (1997) resolve the problem by using a data
dependent normalization rule (the “ML distance normalization”). It is important

96
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
to note, however, that the problem disappears as T tends to inﬁnity, because the
denominator in (2.42) converges in probability to a positive constant under the
maintained assumption.
Another identiﬁcation problem arises when using long run restrictions. Faust
and Leeper (1997) show that additional assumptions on the short run dynamics are
required to enable reliable inference. An intuitive explanation is that for a VAR
with an inﬁnite lag order, a small change of the model parameters has a cumulative
eﬀect on the long run responses of the shocks. An obvious remedy of this problem
is to assume that the VAR order is ﬁnite which is equivalent to the assumption
that all higher autoregressive coeﬃcients are equal to zero. Alternatively, one may
assume that not only the long run eﬀect is zero but also the responses beyond
a lag of, say, 40 periods vanish (Faust and Leaper 1997, Sec. 2.2). Although
this critique is certainly important from a theoretical perspective, it is diﬃcult to
assess the relevance for empirical practice. The message for practical work, which
can be concluded from such kind of reasoning, is that it may be hazardous to rely
on long run restrictions, when identifying the model, in particular, if the lag order
of the VAR is large.
Finally it is interesting to consider the problem, that the dimension of the
empirical VAR is smaller than the underlying dynamic system. In this case the
estimated shocks can only be estimated in an aggregated form. The crucial ques-
tion is, whether the aggregated shocks have the same properties than the original
shocks. In the Blanchard-Quah model the demand shock are identiﬁed as the tran-
sitory shock, whereas the supply shock has a permanent eﬀect on output. Now,
assume that there are m1 > 1 orthogonal demand shocks and m2 > 1 orthogo-
nal supply shocks with the same long run properties. The interesting question
is, whether it is possible to identify a “joint” aggregated demand (supply) shock
as a linear combination of the original demand (supply) shocks only, or whether
the aggregated system mixes up both type of shocks. Faust and Leeper (1997)
derive conditions that ensure that the aggregated demand and supply shock can
be suitably separated. However, without knowledge of the complete dynamical
process, the condition cannot be veriﬁed. Faust and Leeper (1997) present in-

2.9. PROBLEMS WITH THE SVAR APPROACH
97
direct evidence that the condition for an appropriate separation of demand and
supply shocks is violated.
Robustness. In a number of recent papers, the SVAR approach is criticized
for its lack of robustness under diﬀerent structural assumptions. For example,
Cochrane (1998) ﬁnds that output responses vary a lot as one changes identifying
assumptions. Rudebusch (1998, p. 925) concludes the comparison of the shocks
from three diﬀerent SVAR speciﬁcations:
“Obviously, these three series give very diﬀerent interpretations of the
history of monetary policy surprises, and in several periods, the VAR
series describe a stance for monetary policy that is greatly at variance
with historical accounts.”
As a second example, Cooley and Dwyer (1998) summarize their comparison of
diﬀerent SVAR models:
“The ﬁndings of this paper suggest that conclusions about the impor-
tance of technology and other shocks based on simple SVARs are cer-
tainly not invariant to the identifying assumptions and may not be very
reliable as vehicles for identifying the relative importance of shocks.”
Needless to say that this danger is always present, when structural economet-
ric models are based on prior information derived from economic theory. There
seems to be a consensus, however, that SVAR models are particularly sensitive
to alternative identifying assumptions and that conclusions from an SVAR model
are therefore “unreliable” and “fragile”.5 In a similar vein, it is claimed that eco-
nomic theory is not informative enough to arrive at a unique SVAR speciﬁcation
and, hence, the researcher is free to choose among a large number of possible
speciﬁcations. To quote Uhlig (1997):
“There is a danger here that we just get out what we have stuck in,
albeit a bit more polished and with numbers attached ...”
5It is interesting to note that the same arguments were put forward by Leamer (1983) to
criticize the simultaneous equation approach.

98
CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS
To overcome this problem, diﬀerent approaches were suggested to account for the
uncertainty of model speciﬁcation. King and Watson (1997) compute the impulse
responses for all models with plausible identiﬁcation assumptions. The resulting
range of impulse response functions represents the possible eﬀects on the variable
of interest. Of course, whenever the resulting range of impulse responses is wide,
little is learned from the estimation of SVAR models.
A similar approach is suggested by Uhlig (1997) and Faust (1998).
They
assume that economic theory is at best able to make predictions on the sign
of the impulse response at various lag horizons. Uhlig (1997) uses a penalized
likelihood approach that introduces a penalty term implying a sharp decrease
of the maximization criterion whenever the inequality conditions on the impulse
response functions are violated. Faust (1998) considers the range of models that
results from a rotation of the system and satisﬁes the sign restrictions on the
impulse responses. Within this range of models he considers the worst case and
therefore draws a very cautious conclusion about the eﬀect on the shocks.
A closely related approach employs a Bayesian methodology. Sims and Zha
(1998) impose prior information on the autoregressive parameters, whereas Dwyer
(1998) and Gordon and Boccanfuso (1998) directly specify prior distributions
on the plausible shape of the impulse response functions. The latter approach
allows the imposition of inequality restrictions on the impulse response functions
by assigning zero weights to implausible values of the prior distributions of the
impulse responses.
Uhlig (1997) adopts a related Bayesian approach. He uses Litterman’s prior
distribution on the parameters of the VAR model and computes an estimate of
the structural parameters for each realization of the artiﬁcial model, simulated
by using the posterior distribution of the VAR parameters. The parameter values
which do not satisfy the structural assumptions (for example that a positive shock
in interest rates leads to a decreases in the monetary base) are dropped and
conﬁdence intervals can be computed from the set of valid impulse responses
among all simulated realizations.
These alternative approaches are suggested to overcome the lack of robustness

2.9. PROBLEMS WITH THE SVAR APPROACH
99
in the structural VAR analysis. It is however not clear, whether it is realistic
to claim for such kind of robustness. In general, prior information is necessary
because economic data are too uninformative about the underlying structure.
Therefore, it is expected that prior assumptions are important for the analysis
of economic data and, thus, diﬀerent assumptions may produce diﬀerent results.
Similarly, we cannot hope to be able to refute economic theories deﬁnitely by
using a structural approach (cf. Breitung et al. 1993). Therefore, these methods
should be seen as a more or less useful device to recover structures behind the
data. In other words, economic data is used to quantify prior beliefs about the
economic system rather then to decide between alternative theories.

CHAPTER 2. STRUCTURAL VARS

Chapter 3
Problems of temporal aggregation
This chapter addresses the question, how temporal aggregation aﬀects structural
inference. Indeed this is an important issue, since in practice the frequency of
observation is usually diﬀerent from what may be called the natural frequency of
the underlying time series. For example, at ﬁnancial markets, agents react very
rapidly to news and, thus, the natural frequency of a model that describes the
behaviour of ﬁnancial agents is likely to be minutes rather the hours or days.
However, if the natural frequency of the underlying process is high relative to
the observed frequency of the data, temporal aggregation may completely change
the structural relations in the system. It is therefore interesting to investigate the
eﬀects of temporal aggregation on structural inference.
To do so, it is assumed that the data are generated by a discrete stochastic
process with some causal ordering as suggested by Granger (1969). Given the
causal structure of the data generating process, what kind of structural model
results when the data is temporally aggregated?
Does the observed structure
correspond to the underlying causal relationship among the variables or is the
observed structure diﬀerent from the original causal structure?
In this chapter it is argued that SVAR models as considered in Chapter 3 can
be motivated with respect to the underlying causal ordering by using Granger’s
original deﬁnition of a causal process. Conditions are given to ensure that suﬃ-
ciently aggregated data are able to reﬂect the causal structure in the covariance
101

102
CHAPTER 3. PROBLEMS OF TEMPORAL AGGREGATION
matrix of the VAR innovations. It does not come as a surprise, however, that
temporal aggregation implies a loss of information. Speciﬁcally, the contempo-
raneous correlation of the innovations cannot identify the direction of causality.
However, conditions can be given that rule out “spurious instantaneous causality”
and, thus, we are able to verify that the observed structure is not an artifact of
the underlying aggregation process.
Furthermore, I address the question what happens with a particular structure
that can be represented by a SVAR model if the data is temporally aggregated.
It is shown that in general the structural representation of the VAR may change
substantially with the aggregation level of the data. For an empirical example
I ﬁnd that the general shape of the impulse responses does not change a lot by
aggregating the data. However, temporal aggregation has a substantial eﬀect on
the magnitude of impulse responses.
There is already a rich literature that analyses the eﬀects of temporal aggrega-
tion in a multiple time series framework. An early example is Quenouille (1957),
where the temporal aggregation of ARMA processes is studied. Amemiya and Wu
(1972), and Brewer (1973) reﬁne and generalize Quenouille’s result by including
exogenous variables. Zellner and Montmarquette (1971) discuss the eﬀects of tem-
poral aggregation on estimation and testing. Engle (1969) and Wei (1978) analyze
the eﬀects of temporal aggregation on parameter estimation in a distributed lag
model. More recently, Weiss (1984), Stram and Wei (1986), L¨utkepohl (1987), and
Marcellino (1999) provide detailed studies of the eﬀects of temporal aggregation
in a VARMA framework.
The results of these studies can be summarized by quoting Tiao (1999): “So
the causality issue is muddled once the data are aggregated. The problem is that
if the data are observed at intervals when the dynamics are not working properly,
then we may not get any kind of causality.” In this chapter it is argued that this
statement is also true for inference based on structural VARs.
In Section 4.1 I discuss the concept of Granger causality under temporal ag-
gregation. Some useful asymptotic results for large aggregation intervals are pre-
sented in Section 4.2.
The consequences for causal inference are discussed in

3.1. GRANGER CAUSALITY
103
Section 4.3 and the relevance in ﬁnite aggregation intervals is studied in Section
4.4 by using Monte Carlo simulations. In Section 4.5 presents an empirical appli-
cation where the eﬀects of temporal aggregation are studied by using US data of
unemployment and inﬂation.
3.1
Granger causality
Following Granger (1969), consider a conditional distribution with respect to two
information sets which are available at time t, say It and I∗
t = {It, xt, xt−1, . . .},
where xt denotes a (possibly causal) variable. As in Section 2.4, the variable xt
is deﬁned to be Granger causal for the variable yt if there exist an h ∈{1, 2, . . .}
such that
E(yt+h|It) ̸= E(yt+h|I∗
t ) .
(3.1)
If It = {yt, yt−1, . . .}, that is, when causality is investigated in a bivariate system,
it is suﬃcient to consider h = 1 (e.g. L¨utkepohl 1999).
An important problem with this deﬁnition is the choice of the sampling in-
terval. It is possible that Granger causality is observed when data is measured
at a daily basis, say, but at a monthly or quarterly frequency the causality may
disappear. Thus, for inference on causality it is important that the data has the
“correct” sampling frequency. There are two alternative approaches to deal with
this problem. First, it may be assumed that the underlying time series has a con-
tinuous time Wold representation given by y(t) =
R
f(τ)ε(t −τ)dτ, where f(τ) is
a continuous vector function and ε(t) is continuous white noise (e.g. Christiano
and Eichenbaum (1987), Renault and Szafarz (1991)). In this framework the data
should be observed at a (approximately) continuous basis to avoid misleading
inference on causality. However, with the exception of some ﬁnancial variables,
economic data are usually observed at a monthly or quarterly frequency, so the
relevance of such a continuous time framework is limited in practice.
An alternative approach is to assume that the data are generated by a discrete
ARIMA process sampled at some given frequency (e.g.
Tiao 1972, L¨utkepohl
1987, Marcellino 1999). When investigating causality it seems quite obvious how

104
CHAPTER 3. PROBLEMS OF TEMPORAL AGGREGATION
to choose the natural frequency. If we assume that cause and eﬀect are ordered
in time so that the causal event is observed in advance of the eﬀect then the
sampling frequency should be suﬃcient to distinguish the cause and the eﬀect.
Thus, at the natural frequency there should be no contemporaneous relationship
between the cause and eﬀect (see also Granger 1988).
On the other hand, if
the process is aggregated such that the cause and eﬀect is (partly) observed at
the same time, then the causal relationship implies a contemporary relationship
between the variables.
It therefore seems useful to link the concept of Granger causality at the natural
frequency with contemporaneous correlation for aggregated processes.
Such a
causality concept is provided by the following deﬁnition.
DEFINITION 3.1 Let ξt = [xt, yt, z′
t]′ be an n × 1 vector of time series and
zt is an (n −2) × 1 subvector.
Further, deﬁne the information sets as It =
{zt, yt, zt−1, yt−1, . . .} and I+
t = {ξt, ξt−1, . . .} = {It, xt, xt−1, . . .}. Then xt is said
to be a cause of yt with respect to the underlying sampling frequency if
E(yt+1|xt+1, zt+1, I+
t ) ̸= E(yt+1|zt+1, It).
This deﬁnition combines traditional Granger causality with instantaneous causal-
ity as used in L¨utkepohl (1991, p. 40f), for example. In a vector autoregressive
system, causality according to Deﬁnition 3.1 can be tested by running the regres-
sion
yt =
p
X
i=1
αiyt−j +
p
X
j=0
βjxt−j +
p
X
j=0
γ′
jzt−j + ut
and testing the hypothesis β0 = β1 = · · · = βp.
If the process is observed at the natural sampling frequency, then there is no
contemporaneous relationship between xt and yt conditional on zt and the past
of the process. Accordingly, we have β0 = 0 at the natural frequency and our
deﬁnition of causality is equivalent to the traditional (Granger) causality. If, on
the other hand, the process is multivariate white noise, then xt is an “instanta-
neous cause” of yt whenever ρ(yt, xt|zt) ̸= 0, where ρ(a, b|c) denotes the partial
correlation between a and b conditional on c.

3.2. ASYMPTOTICS

3.2
Asymptotics
In order to examine the relationship between contemporaneous correlation and
Granger causality in the presence of temporally aggregated data, two diﬀerent
procedures are considered (e.g. see L¨utkepohl 1987). For ﬂow data, time series
values are cumulated (or averaged) at k successive time periods
¯yt = k−1/2
k−1
X
j=0
yt−j ,
where the factor k−1/2 is introduced to obtain a limiting process with a ﬁnite
variance. The aggregated series results from applying skip-sampling of the form
¯YN = ¯ykN ,
N = 1, 2, . . . .
Stock data are aggregated by directly applying the skip-sampling scheme to the
data, so that YN = ykN for N = 1, 2, . . ..
It is known (see, e.g., L¨utkepohl 1987 and Marcellino 1999) that if the original
process is an ARMA process then the aggregated process also has an ARMA
representation. In general, zero restrictions on the autoregressive representation
of the original process are lost when aggregating the process, so that “spurious
causality” may occur in aggregated time series.
In order to obtain some general results on causality in aggregated time series
we consider an asymptotic theory for large aggregation intervals k. The following
theorem summarizes the results for stationary variables.
THEOREM 3.1 Let yt be generated by an n dimensional linear process yt =
C0εt + C1εt−1 + C2εt−2 + · · ·, where εt is white noise, C0 = In, E(εtε′

yt is one-summable such that P∞

Since

for p ≥2 and j = 0, 1, . . .
it follows that the autocovariances disappear for p ≥2. ■
According to Theorem 3.1, it turns out that for k →∞, the aggregated
processes are asymptotically white noise. Of course this result is not particularly
surprising, since it is intuitively plausible that with increasing sampling interval,
short run dynamics disappear. Furthermore, for moderate k it is expected that
aggregated ﬂow variables are well approximated by a vector MA(1) process. The

3.2. ASYMPTOTICS

reason for this is that according to (iv), the ﬁrst order autocorrelation is O(k−1),
while (v) implies that higher order autocorrelations are o(k−1).
Next, assume that yt is a vector of integrated variables such that yt is diﬀerence
stationary.

(v) To simplify the proof we assume that the degree of the polynomial C(L) =

with q < k. Since k →∞the proof is valid for q →∞, as well. Of course, the

Similarly it can be shown that the higher order autocorrelations converge to zero

ﬂow variables has the vector MA(1) representation:
k−1(¯YN −¯YN−1) = UN + (2 −

(3.2)
where
E(UNU ′

3.2. ASYMPTOTICS
113
Note that for the special case where n = 1 (a single time series), our results
correspond to the result of Working (1960) who shows that the ﬁrst order auto-
correlation of the increments from an aggregated random walk is 0.25.
The asymptotic results of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 imply that for diﬀerence sta-
tionary stock variables as well as for stationary and diﬀerence stationary ﬂow
variables the contemporaneous relationship of the limiting process reﬂects the
causal relationship at frequency zero in the sense of Geweke (1986) and Granger
and Lin (1995).
It is interesting to consider the case that yt is cointegrated. To discuss the
eﬀects of aggregating a set of cointegrated variables it is useful to deﬁne the ma-
trix Q = [β, β⊥]′, where β is an n × r matrix of cointegration vectors such that
zt = β′yt is stationary. The matrix β⊥is a n × (n −r) orthogonal complement of
β. The linear combinations wt = β′
⊥yt are assumed to be I(1). From Theorem 3.2
(iii) it follows that ¯ZN −¯ZN−1 is Op(1) whereas ¯WN −¯WN−1 is Op(k1/2). Hence,
as the aggregation interval k tends to inﬁnity, the variance of the “nonstation-
ary linear combinations” dominates the variance of the “error correction terms”.
Consequently,

#
=

k3/2Q−1
2 ( ¯WN −¯WN−1) + Op(k−1)
where Q−1
2
is the lower n × (n −r) block of Q−1. This implies that the diﬀerences
of ¯YN possess a singular distribution as k tends to inﬁnity. It is important to note
that the limiting processes of the aggregated variables have a singular spectral
density matrix for all frequencies 0 ≤ω ≤π, while the spectral density matrix of
yt is singular at ω = 0 only. In other words, the limiting behavior of the aggregated
time series is dominated by the stochastic trends and, thus, the standardized
variance of the error correction terms tends to zero. Since this does not seem
to be a relevant feature of observed time series, the aggregation of cointegrated
variables is excluded from the subsequent considerations.

CHAPTER 3. PROBLEMS OF TEMPORAL AGGREGATION
3.3
Contemporaneous causality
Using the causality deﬁnition given in Section 4.2, I am able to consider the
relationship between Granger causality at the natural frequency (k = 1) and con-
temporaneous causality in the limiting process (k →∞). As mentioned above,
this comparison is of interest as it is unlikely that any given vector of time series
will be observed with a time scale which allows an unambiguous ordering of cause
and eﬀect in time. Thus, it is helpful to know in which situation contempora-
neous causality corresponds to Granger causality and whether it is possible that
“spurious causality” results from the aggregation process.
Spurious causality between two variables xt and yt occurs when the variables
do not possess a causal relationship at the natural frequency but for the aggregated
variables we ﬁnd ρ(XN, YN|ZN) ̸= 0. In this case, the causality in the aggregated
process is obviously due to the aggregation procedure. For the practical appli-
cation of a concept of causality it is therefore important to have conditions that
rules out such kind of spurious causality. The following theorem gives suﬃcient
conditions for non-causality between two aggregated variables.
THEOREM 3.3 Let ξt = [xt, yt, z′
t]′, where zt is a (n −2) × 1 vector. Assume
that either:
(i)
ξt is a vector of stationary ﬂow variables, or
(ii)
ξt is a vector of diﬀerence stationary ﬂow variables, or
(iii)
ξt is a vector of diﬀerence stationary stock variables.
If there is no Granger causality between xt and yt and
(a)
xt →
/ zj,t or (b)
yt →
/ zj,t for all j = 1, . . . , n −2,
where zj,t is the j′th element of zt, then, as k →∞, we have for the partial
correlations of the aggregated variables that:
for case (i)
ρ( ¯XN, ¯YN| ¯ZN) = 0
for case (ii)
ρ(∆¯XN, ∆¯YN|∆¯ZN) = 0
for case (iii)
ρ(∆XN, ∆YN|∆ZN) = 0 .

3.3. CONTEMPORANEOUS CAUSALITY
115
Proof: For convenience, we conﬁne ourselves to a trivariate VAR(p) process.
The proof can easily be generalized to systems with n > 3.
First consider a VAR process obeying the conditions:
xt →
/ yt
yt →
/ xt
(a)
xt →
/ zt,
that is, there is no causality between y1,t and y2,t and condition (a) is satisﬁed.
From the Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 we know that the limiting processes for the cases
(i) – (iii) are white noise with a covariance matrix proportional to the spectral
density matrix of the original process. Thus, the limiting process for case (i), for
example, has a representation of the form:


where E(UNU ′
N) = Ω. A similar representation exists for the cases (ii) and (iii).
We therefore conﬁne ourselves to case (i).
The proof for case (ii) and (iii) is
straightforward.
Since we assume that the MA representation is invertible there exists an au-
toregressive representation with autoregressive polynomial

CHAPTER 3. PROBLEMS OF TEMPORAL AGGREGATION
The zero restrictions in the matrix ¯A result from the assumptions on the causal
relationship between the variables. Accordingly, we ﬁnd
(1 −¯a11) ¯XN = ¯a13 ¯ZN + U1,N
Since ρ(¯YN, ¯ZN| ¯ZN) = 0 and ρ(¯YN, U3,N| ¯ZN) = 0 it immediately follows that
ρ( ¯XN, ¯YN| ¯ZN) = 0.
Second, consider the condition (b) yt →/ zt instead of (a) xt →/ zt. In this case
the limiting process can be represented as



This gives:
(1 −¯a22)¯YN
=
¯a23ZN + U2,N
(1 −¯a22) ¯XNYN
=
¯a23XNZN + XNU2,N
Since ρ( ¯XN, ¯ZN| ¯ZN) = 0 and ρ( ¯XN, U2,N| ¯ZN) = 0 it follows that ρ( ¯XN, ¯YN| ¯ZN) =
0.
To generalize the proof to the case k > 3, we let ¯ZN be a (n −2)-dimensional
vector. The reasoning of the proof applies to this case in a straightforward manner.
■
Theorem 3.3 gives suﬃcient conditions for ruling out spurious contempora-
neous causality.
If conditions (a) or (b) are violated it may be the case that
there is contemporaneous causality between aggregated variables, although there
is no Granger causality at the original time scale. This is the case of spurious
contemporaneous causality.
Necessary and suﬃcient conditions for ruling out spurious contemporaneous
causality in aggregated time series can be derived from the relationship between
the original process at k = 1 and the limiting process for k →∞. Unfortunately,
such conditions are nonlinear and depend on the precise parameter values of the
process describing yt.
Since these parameter values are usually unknown and

3.3. CONTEMPORANEOUS CAUSALITY
117
cannot be estimated without observing the process at its natural frequency, the
practical value of the necessary and suﬃcient conditions is quite limited.
If xt →yt and yt →xt we say that there is feedback causality between xt and
yt. An important consequence of Theorem 3.3 can be derived for the case that
there is no feedback causality among the variables.
COROLLARY 3.1 For the cases (i) – (iii) of Theorem 3.3 and under the as-
sumption that there is no feedback causality among the variables it follows that,
as k →∞, there is no spurious causality among the aggregated variables of the
system.
Whenever there is no feedback Granger causality, the variables of the system can
be arranged such that one of the conditions (a) and (b) in Theorem 3.3 is satisﬁed.
This rules out the case of spurious contemporary causality.
Another (less trivial) consequence of Theorem 3.3 can be derived for a trivari-
ate system. Following Dufour and Renault (1998, Deﬁnition 2.2) and L¨utkepohl
and Burda (1997) we say that xt does not cause yt at horizon h if
E(yt+h|It) = E(yt+h|I+
t ),
(3.3)
where It and I+
t are the same information sets as in (3.1). Obviously, the usual
deﬁnition of Granger causality given in (3.1) is a special case with h = 1. If xt
does not cause yt at any horizon we write xt →/ ∞yt. For a trivariate system the
following result holds.
COROLLARY 3.2 Let ξt = [xt, yt, zt]′ be a stationary or the diﬀerences of a
diﬀerence stationary 3×1 vector with an invertible MA representation. If yt →
/ ∞zt
and (i) – (iii) of Theorem 3.3 hold, then as k →∞, there is no spurious causality
among the aggregated counterparts.
Proof: Consider the AR representation of the system
ξt = A1ξt−1 + A2ξt−2 + · · · + εt .
Causality at horizon h can be deduced from the conditional expectation
E(ξt|ξt−h, ξt−h−1, . . .) = π(h)
1 ξt−h + π(h)
2 ξt−h−1 + π(h)
3 ξt−h−2 + · · ·

118
CHAPTER 3. PROBLEMS OF TEMPORAL AGGREGATION
where the matrices π(h)
j
are given in Dufour and Renault (1998). Non-causality
between xt and yt at horizon h implies
e′
2π(h)
j e1 = 0
for j = 1, 2, . . . ,
where ei is the i’th column of the 3×3 identity matrix. The matrix π(h)
1
is identical
to the matrix Bh in the moving average representation
ξt = εt + B1εt−1 + B2εt−2 + · · ·
Thus, noncausality at all horizons implies
e′
iBhej = 0
for h = 1, 2, . . .
(3.4)
Assuming stationary ﬂow variables it follows from Theorem 3.1 that the limiting
process can be represented as (I3 −¯A)¯YN = UN. Non-causality of the form yt →
/ zt
at h = 1 implies that the (3, 1) elements of the matrices Ak, k = 1, 2, . . . are zero.
Accordingly, the limiting distribution can be represented as
(1 −¯a11) ¯XN
=
¯a12 ¯YN + ¯a13 ¯ZN + U1,N
(3.5)
(1 −¯a22)¯YN
=
¯a21 ¯XN + ¯a23 ¯ZN + U2,N
(3.6)
(1 −¯a33) ¯ZN
=
¯a31 ¯XN + U3,N
(3.7)
where ¯aij denotes the (i, j) element of the matrix ¯A = P Ak.
From the MA
representation we get (I −¯A)−1 = (I −¯B), where ¯B = P Bk. From (3.4) it follows
that for yt →
/ ∞zt we have ¯b32 = 0. Thus, the representation ¯ξN = (I3 −¯A)−1UN =
(I3 −¯B)UN gives rise to the equation
¯ZN = −¯b31U1,N + (1 −¯b33)U3,N .
Solving this equation for U3,N and inserting in (3.7) gives
¯XN = c1 ¯ZN + c2U1,N ,
(3.8)
where c1 and c2 are functions of ¯a31, ¯a33,¯b31 and ¯b33. Comparing (3.8) with (3.5)
shows that ¯a12 must be zero and, thus, implies the same restriction for the limiting
process as the assumption that yt does not cause xt. From Theorem 3.3 it follows

3.3. CONTEMPORANEOUS CAUSALITY
119
that in this case there is no spurious contemporaneous causality between ¯YN and
¯ZN.
The proofs for the cases (i) and (iii) are essentially the same. ■
This result is intuitively plausible because the assumption of no causality at any
horizon rules out indirect causal eﬀects via the remaining variable zt. Accordingly,
for xt →yt we must rule out that xt causes zt at longer lag horizons h, since
otherwise yt may be used to predict zt+h via xt+j, where 0 < j < h. Unfortunately,
I was not able to generalize this result to higher dimensional systems with n > 3.
In order to illustrate the results in this section, it is useful to construct some
examples based on a trivariate VAR(1) model for yt, where all innovation terms
represent mutually uncorrelated white noise processes.
Example A: Assume that ξt = [xt, yt, zt] is stationary and has a causal structure
given by xt →yt and yt →zt. In particular, assume a VAR(1) representation of
the form
xt
=
ε1,t
yt
=
axt−1 + ε2,t
zt
=
byt−1 + ε3,t .
Since xt →
/ zt and zt →
/ yt, it follows from Theorem 3.3 that ρ( ¯XN, ¯ZN|¯YN) = 0, and
that there is no contemporaneous causality between ¯XN and ¯ZN. Furthermore,
there is no feedback causality among the variable, so that the result immediately
follows from the Corollary 3.1.
Example B: Assume that a vector of ﬂow variables is generated by a stationary
process given by:
xt
=
ayt−1 + bzt−1 + ε1,t
yt
=
ε2,t
zt
=
ε3,t .
Applying Granger’s concept of causality, there is no causality between yt and zt.
Further, a simple calculation shows that for the limiting process, ρ(¯YN, ¯ZN| ¯XN) =

120
CHAPTER 3. PROBLEMS OF TEMPORAL AGGREGATION
−ab/(a2 + a2 + 1). Thus, a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the aggregated
variables ¯YN and ¯ZN to have no contemporaneous causal relationship is that either
a or b, or both parameters are equal to zero. This result is also an immediate
consequence from Theorem 3.3, which states that there is no contemporaneous
causality if either yt or zt is not Granger causal for xt.
Example C: To illustrate the problems with aggregated stock variables which
are discussed above, consider the stationary process given by:
xt
=
ε1,t
yt
=
axt−1 + ε2,t
zt
=
byt−1 + ε3,t.
In this system, xt →yt and yt →zt. For k ≥3 the aggregated process becomes
white noise with:
XN
=
U1,N
YN
=
U2,N
ZN
=
abXN + U3,N .
For ab ̸= 0 there exists spurious contemporaneous causality between XN and
ZN, as there is no Granger causality between xt and zt. Stated another way, the
indirect causal relationship between xt and zt via yt becomes a direct causal link
under aggregation. See also L¨utkepohl and Burda (1997).

3.4. MONTE CARLO EXPERIMENTS
121
where d ∈{0, 1} and εi,t is an i.i.d. vector of standard normal random variables.
For b ̸= 0, the Granger causal structure of this system is: xt →yt and yt →zt.
From Theorem 3.3 and Corollary 3.1 it follows that as k →∞, the limiting process
has a partial correlation structure such that E(u1,Nu3,N|u2,N) = 0 and all other
partial correlations are nonzero, where the uj,N (j = 1, 2, 3) denote the innovations
from an estimated VAR[4] model using data generated according to (3.9) and
aggregated appropriately. Swanson and Granger henceforth: SG (1997) propose
tests for assessing whether the above partial correlation restriction holds which
are based on Fisher’s z-statistics or alternatively on t-statistics from regressions
involving the residuals. Here we use the Fisher’s z-statistic.
Empirical sizes corresponding to 5% nominal size tests and for various param-
eterizations of the VAR are reported in Tables 4.1. Note also that results are
reported for stationary stock variables, which are not treated in Theorem 3.3. In
all experiments, b is set equal to 0.5, as results were found not to be sensitive
to the choice of b. The parameter a is set equal to {0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8}. Not
surprisingly, the magnitude of the parameter a is crucial when k is small, as a
determines the roots of the autoregressive polynomial in our model. Thus, our
asymptotic results may be a poor guide to ﬁnite sample behavior for small k and
|a| close to unity.1 All entries in the Table 4.1 are based on 10,000 Monte Carlo
replications, and all estimations use 100 observations of appropriately aggregated
data.
Tables 4.1a-c contain results for cases (i) – (iii) in 3.3.
Interestingly, the
empirical sizes approach the nominal size quite quickly when k increases, for small
and moderately sized values of a. For a = 0.8, however, the SG test is upwards
biased, even for relatively large values of k.
Table 4.1d reports results for stationary stock variables, for which Theorem
3.3 does not apply. For a = 0, however, note that An = 0 for n ≥3, and thus the
covariance matrix of the limiting process is Ω+ AΩA′ + A2Ω(A2)′ (see Theorem
1Recall also that the aggregated processes which we construct are VARMA processes, in
general. Thus, lower order VAR approximations may not yield good estimates of the errors of
the process.

Notes: Entries correspond to the frequency of times that the correct con-
temporaneous causal structure is uncovered, based on empirical procedure
given in SG (1997). Results are based on estimations using 100 observa-
tions of data generated according to (3.9), and aggregated according to
the aggregation interval, k. All entries are based on 10,000 Monte Carlo
replications.

3.1 (i)), which is a diagonal matrix in this special case. Therefore, all partial
correlations are zero, and spurious contemporaneous correlation should not arise
for a = 0. This is the reason why the empirical size of the SG test is still close
to the nominal size when stationary stock variables, as long as a is close to zero.
In contrast, for a substantially diﬀerent from zero, partial correlations need not
die out as k increases. Indeed, from Table 4.1 it is seen that the empirical sizes
are far from the nominal size for large values of a(i.e. when a = 0.8 and k = 100
empirical size is 0.66).
3.5
Aggregation of SVAR models
The asymptotic results of Section 4.3 can be used to analyse the (asymptotic)
eﬀects of the aggregation procedure on the estimated structural model. Assume
that at some (“natural”) sampling frequency the process can be represented as a
stationary VAR[p] model with
Bεt = Rut .
The vector ut represents the structural shocks, where it is assumed that Ω=
E(utu′
t) is a diagonal matrix. We therefore have E(εtε′
t) = Σ = B−1RΩR′B′−1.
From Theorem 3.1 it follows that for k →∞the covariance matrix of the aggre-
gated process is given by
E(yNy′
N) = (I −A1 −· · · −Ap)−1Σ(I −A′
1 −· · · −A′
p)−1
and, thus, the corresponding structural model is
(I −A1 −· · · −Ap)−1BεN = RuN .
In general, the aggregation of the data therefore may have a substantial eﬀect on
the structural model and may even change the sign of the structural parameter.
To assess the eﬀect of temporal aggregation in practice, a simple example is
considered. Let Ut and πt denote the unemployment rate and the yearly inﬂation
rate of the US, which is observed on a monthly basis from 1960 (i) to 1998 (xii).

3.5. AGGREGATION OF SVAR MODELS
125
Two diﬀerent speciﬁcations are considered.
One is the neoclassical version of
the Phillips curve (cf. Dolado et al. 1999). This model employs a triangular
identiﬁcation given by
εU
t
=
us
t
επ
t
=
r12us
t + ud
t ,
where εU
t , επ
t are the residuals from an estimated VAR[15] model with a constant
mean, which is suggested by the AIC criterion. The supply shock is denoted by
us
t and ud
t denotes the demand shock. The notion behind this speciﬁcation is that
in a (neo)classical framework, monetary shocks should not aﬀect real variables.
The estimated impulse response functions for this model are depicted in Figure
4.1. Both shocks have a positive short run eﬀect on the unemployment rate so
that these shocks represent an unfavourable change in supply or demand. The
supply shock has a negative eﬀect on the inﬂation rate at 1–3 years.2 Since we are
interested in the eﬀect of temporal aggregation we do not give a detailed discussion
of the economic implications (see Dolado et al. (1999) for a detailed discussion of
alternative speciﬁcations).
If the data is aggregated by computing the averages3 of k time periods, we
ﬁnd that for a quarterly sample frequency (k = 3) the estimated model yields
qualitatively similar results.
There is again a peak at 1 year in the impulse
response of the unemployment rate with respect to a supply shock.
Similarly
the minimum of the impulse response of inﬂation following a demand shock is
a little less than 2 years for k = 1 and k = 3. Therefore, the general shape of
the impulse response functions does not change a lot when aggregating monthly
data to a quarterly interval. Similar conclusions can be drawn be aggregating the
2It is not the intention to draw economic conclusions from this example.
Therefore, no
conﬁdence intervals are presented. Furthermore, temporal aggregation reduces the number of
observations so that it is diﬃcult to compare the conﬁdence intervals for diﬀerent k.
3The reader may notice that the unemployment rate is not a ﬂow variable but a stock variable.
However, since in the theoretical work I did not consider models that mix stock and ﬂow data,
I assume that both variables are ﬂow data. In fact, oﬃcial agencies also report the average
unemployment rate within a month (quarter).

data further to a bi-anual sample interval. Again the maximum and minimum
of the impulse response functions occur at roughly the same time but the size of
the impulse responses seems to be aﬀected to a greater extent. For example, the
minimum in the impulse responses of the inﬂation rate with respect to supply
shocks is −12 for k = 3 but −7 for k = 6.
The maximum response of the
unemployment rate following a supply shock is roughly 8 for k = 3 and only 4
for k = 6. Therefore, it seems that the aggregation of the data “smoothes” the
unemployment rate.
In order to check whether the conclusion is a result of the particular neoclas-
sical speciﬁcation, we repeat the experiment by using a monetarist identiﬁcation
scheme. In this speciﬁcation it is assumed that the monetary (demand) shock may
aﬀect the unemployment rate at a short horizon but this eﬀect dies out with an
increasing lag horizon. That is, we impose the long run restriction as in Blanchard
and Quah (1989). The estimated impulse responses are depicted in Figure 4.2.
It is seen that this identiﬁcation scheme yields quite diﬀerent impulse responses.
Again we do not discuss the economic implications of this estimate but focus on
the eﬀect of temporal aggregation.
It turns out that the general shape of the impulse response functions is com-
patible for the diﬀerent aggregation intervals. In particular the relative maxima
and minima of the impulse response functions occur at roughly the same time.
However, the magnitude of the eﬀects becomes less important for higher aggrega-
tion intervals. For example, the long run eﬀect of supply shocks is 0.30 for k = 1
but 0.15 for k = 3 and 0.10 for k = 6. Similarly, the maximum of the impulse
response of inﬂation with respect to a supply shock is 0.36 at a monthly basis but
0.75 for quarterly data and 1.0 for the bi-anual aggregation interval.
Our experiment suggests that temporal aggregation may have an important
eﬀect on the magnitude of the impulse response but seems to have little eﬀect
on the general shape of the impulse response functions. Of course, it remains to
show that this conclusions applies to other applications as well.

Inference in nonlinear models
Since the introduction of the concept of cointegration by Granger (1981) the ana-
lysis of cointegrated models was intensively studied in a linear context, whereas
the work on the extension to nonlinear cointegration is still comparatively lim-
ited. Useful reviews of recent work in the analysis of nonlinear cointegration are
provided by Granger and Ter¨asvirta (1993), Granger (1995), and Granger, Inoue
and Morin (1997).
In many cases, economic theory suggests a nonlinear relationship as for the
production function or the Phillips curve, for example. However, theory does not
always provide a precise speciﬁcation of the functional form so that it is desirable
to have nonparametric tools for estimation and inference.
Unfortunately, the usual nonparametric techniques based on kernel functions
are not applicable in a nonstationary framework. The reason is that the nonpara-
metric estimate of E(y|x0) for some given value x0 is based on neighbourhood
values of x0, where the kernel function employs a weight function decreasing in
|x−x0|. If xt is a random walk, then the process drifts away from the initial value
and, thus, the relative number of observations in a neighbourhood [x0 −ϵ, x0 + ϵ]
tends to zero. This can be illustrated by considering the number of axis cross-
ings, that is, the number of times xt crosses the zero level. The number of axis
crossings can be seen as a measure of the frequency the process returns to a zero
initial value. For a stationary Gaussian AR(1) process, Kedem (1980) shows that
129

130
CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR MODELS
the probability of axis crossings is
Prob(xt < 0|xt−1 > 0) = 1
2 −1
π sin−1 ρ ,
where ρ denotes the ﬁrst order autocorrelation of xt. Note that if ρ approaches
one, then this probability tends to zero. Indeed, for a random walk process Bur-
ridge and Guerre (1996) show that the probability of an axis crossing tends to
zero with T −1/2. Similarly, it can be shown that for a random walk the relative
number of observations in the interval [x0 −ϵ, x0 +ϵ] tends to zero with T −1/2 and
asymptotically does not depend on the value x0 (cf. Burridge and Guerre 1996).
Therefore, the asymptotic theory for kernel estimates is not applicable in the case
of nonstationary variables.
Alternatively, Granger and Hallman (1991a, 1991b) and Breitung and Gouri´e-
roux (1997) suggest using the rank transformation. It is well known that the
ranks of the observations are invariant under monotonic transformations of the
data. Thus, statistics based on the ranks of the observations do not depend on
(monotonous) nonlinear functions of the data. To motivate the test procedure I
ﬁrst show in Section 5.1 that linear cointegration tests may have a poor power
against nonlinear cointegration relationships. In Section 5.2 this idea is adopted
to test for nonlinear cointegration. Furthermore, the rank transformation is used
to decide whether the cointegration relationship is linear or nonlinear (Section
5.3).
An alternative strand of literature was initiated by Bierens (1997a,b) and
Vogelsang (1998a,b). These papers allow for unknown nonlinearity in the short
run dynamics of the process. Accordingly, such tests are well suited to test for
cointegrated models with a nonlinear adjustment process. In Section 5.4 a new test
procedure is suggested. The small sample properties of the test are considered in
Section 5.5. Furthermore, the test procedures are applied to investigate the term
structure of interest rates and the relationship between German dual-class shares.

CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR MODELS
4.1
Inconsistency of linear cointegration tests
To illustrate the problems of applying linear cointegration tests to a nonlinear
relationship, it is helpful to consider a simple example. Let xt be a nonlinear
random walk given by x3
t =
tP
j=1
vj, where {vt}T
1 is a white noise sequence with
vt ∼N(0, σ2
v). Furthermore, yt is given by
yt = x3
t + ut ,
(4.1)
where ut is white noise with ut ∼N(0, σ2
u). Figure 5.1 presents a realization of the
sequences xt and yt, where σ2
v = σ2
u = 0.01. The sample size is T = 200. Appar-
ently, there is a fairly strong comovement between both series suggesting a stable
long run relationship. However, applying an augmented Dickey-Fuller test (with
four lagged diﬀerences and a constant), the value of the t-statistic is −2.77, which
is insigniﬁcant with respect to the 0.05 signiﬁcance level. In fact, the residuals of
the linear cointegration regression (see Figure 5.2) do not look stationary. On the
other hand, if the cointegration regression is based on the underlying nonlinear
relationship, that is, yt is regressed on x3
t, the resulting residual series resembles
white noise (see Figure 5.3). Applying the rank tests suggested in Section 5.3
yields signiﬁcant test statistics with respect to all reasonable signiﬁcance levels.
This example illustrates that ignoring the nonlinear nature of the cointegration
relationship may lead to the misleading conclusion that there exists no long run
relationship between the series.
On the other hand, one may argue that there is no problem with a test that
fails to reject in the presence a nonlinear alternative because we are interested
in detecting a linear cointegrating relationship. In many applications, however,
it is not clear whether the variables must be transformed (e.g. to logarithms)
to achieve a linear cointegrating relationship (e.g. Franses and McAleer 1998)
and thus the robustness of the test against such monotonic transformation is a
desirable property of a cointegration test.
For a theoretical analysis of a nonlinear cointegration relationship, diﬀerent
concepts are used. Granger and Hallman (1991a) and Granger (1995) consider
time series which are long memory in mean but have a nonlinear relationship

4.1. INCONSISTENCY OF LINEAR COINTEGRATION TESTS
133
which is short memory in mean. Corradi (1995) considers “non-strong mixing”
processes (processes with a long memory) and strong mixing processes (short
memory). Here we I adopt the deﬁnition of an integrated process due to Phillips
(1987a). The degree of integration is deﬁned as follows:
DEFINITION 4.1 (i) A time series zt is I(0) if, as T →∞,

zt, and W(a) represents a standard Brown-
ian motion. (ii) If (1 −B)dzt ∼I(0), then zt is integrated of order d, denoted as
zt ∼I(d).
Diﬀerent sets of suﬃcient conditions for zt ∼I(0) are given in Phillips (1987a),
Gallant and White (1988), and Phillips and Solo (1992), for example. If we assume
that yt is stationary with an invertible MA representation then the usual deﬁnition
used in Section 1.3 results.
However, since we assume that yt is a nonlinear
process, it may not possess a MA representation and, therefore, the assumption
of a stationary process is overly restrictive within a nonlinear framework (e.g.
Corradi 1995).
In this section I consider the nonlinear relationship between two real valued
time series {xt}T
1 and {yt}T
1
yt = f(xt) + ut ,
(4.2)
where yt ∼I(1) and f(xt) ∼I(1). Under the null hypothesis, ut is assumed to be
I(1), whereas under the alternative of nonlinear cointegration, ut ∼I(0).
As demonstrated by Granger and Hallman (1991b), the Dickey-Fuller test may
perform poorly when applied to a nonlinear transformation of a random walk. To
investigate the eﬀects of a nonlinear cointegration relationship on the power of
a residual based cointegration test, it is convenient to consider a variant of the
Dickey-Fuller test due to Sargan and Bhargava (1983) and Phillips and Ouliaris1
1The Sargan-Bhargava statistic equals the inverse of the variance ratio statistic suggested by
Phillips and Ouliaris.

(1990). The statistic is given by

(yt −ˆβxt)2,
(4.3)
where the ˆβ is the least-squares estimator from a regression of yt on xt. The
parameter ω11·2 is deﬁned in Phillips and Ouliaris (1990, below eq. 12) and can
be neglected in what follows.
For the function z = f(x) the following assumption is made:
Assumption 4.1 (i) The function f(x) is monotonically increasing. (ii) There
exists a function h(a) such that f −1(az) = h(a)f −1(z), where f −1(z) indicates the
inverse function.
In the following theorem, it is stated that a test against linear cointegration
may be inconsistent for some class of nonlinear functions. Further results can be
obtained by using the framework of Park and Phillips (1999). However, since the
latter approach requires some specialized concepts that are of no interest here,
I will conﬁne myself to a simple class of nonlinear functions, which includes the
function yt = xa
t as a special case.
THEOREM 4.1 Let zt ∼I(1) and yt is generated as in (4.2), where ut ∼I(0).
Under Assumption 4.1, a test based on the statistic S2
T given in (4.3) is consistent
if and only if f(x) is a linear function.

Since x = f −1(z) is an aﬃne mapping it is seen that the right hand side of (4.5)
is zero iﬀf(x) = bx with some constant b. ■
This Theorem shows that residual based cointegration tests are inconsistent
for the class of functions given by Assumption 4.1. With some straightforward
modiﬁcations the result extends to other unit root tests like the original Dickey-
Fuller test.
An example may help to illustrate the result. Let yt be generated as in the
previous example given in eq. (4.1). Using (4.5) and f −1(z) = x1/3 we have for
β ̸= 0:

Thus, under the alternative of nonlinear cointegration, the test statistic is Op(1).
Accordingly, a test based on S2
T is inconsistent against a nonlinear cointegration
relationship as given in (4.1).

136
CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR MODELS
4.2
Rank tests for unit roots
Before considering tests for cointegration based on ranks, it is useful to review the
theory on rank tests for a unit root. Assume that the time series xt is generated
by the autoregressive process:
xt = αxt−1 + ut ,
where ut is I(0) as deﬁned in Deﬁnition 4.1.
The test statistic is based on the ranks of yt deﬁned as
RT(yt) = Rank[of yt among y1, . . . , yT] .
An asymptotic theory for the ranks is developed by Breitung and Gouri´eroux
(1997) and is given in a slightly more general form in the following theorem:
THEOREM 4.2 Let f(yt) ∼I(1), where f(·) is a strictly monotonous func-
tion. Then, as T →∞, the limiting distribution of the sequence of ranks can be
represented as
T −1RT(x[aT]) ⇒aA1 + (1 −a)A2 ,
where A1 and A2 are two independent random variables with an arcsine distribu-
tion.

zero otherwise. Then,

Z 1
a
1I[W(u) < W(a)]du = (1 −a)A2 ,
where A2 is another random variable with an arcsine distribution independent of
A1. ■
The arcsine distribution has a quite diﬀerent shape than the normal distri-
bution and some properties are discussed in Breitung and Gouri´eroux (1997).
Theorem 4.2 generalizes Theorem 1 of Breitung and Gouri´eroux (1997) to serially
correlated time series. It is important to notice that short run dynamics in ∆yt
do not change the distribution of the ranks. Thus, the ranks do not depend on
the long run variance of the process.
These results can be used to construct a rank test for cointegration. Consider
the null hypothesis that f(xt) and g(yt) are independent random walk sequences.
This null hypothesis is tested against the alternative of a cointegration relationship
of the form:
ut = g(yt) −f(xt) ,
(4.6)
where f(xt) ∼I(1), g(yt) ∼I(1) and ut ∼I(0). The functions g(y) and f(x)
are monotonically increasing.
If it is not known whether these functions are
monotonically increasing or decreasing, a two-sided test is available. A similar
framework is considered in Granger and Hallman (1991a).
The rank statistic is constructed by replacing f(xt) and g(yt) by RT(xt) and
RT(yt), respectively. Since it is assumed that f(xt) and g(yt) are two random

138
CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR MODELS
walk series, it follows that RT(xt) = RT[f(xt)] and RT(yt) = RT[g(yt)] behave like
ranked random walks for which the limiting distribution is given in Theorem 4.2.
The advantage of a statistic based on the sequence of ranks is that the functions
f(·) and g(·) need not be known.
We consider two “distance measures” between the sequences RT(xt) and RT(yt):
κT
=
T −1 sup
t |dt|
(4.7)
ξT
=
T −3
T
X
t=1
d2
t ,
(4.8)
where dt = RT(yt) −RT(xt). It should be noted that dt is Op(T) and, thus, the
normalization factors are diﬀerent from other applications of these measures. The
statistic κT is a Kolmogorov-Smirnov type of statistic considered by Lo (1991) and
ξT is a Cramer-von-Mises type of statistic used by Sargan and Bhargava (1983).
The null hypothesis of no (nonlinear) cointegration between xt and yt is rejected
if the test statistics are too small.
It is interesting to note that the statistic ξT allows for diﬀerent interpretations.
Let ˜bT denote the least-squares estimate from a regression of RT(yt) on RT(xt).
Using P RT(xt)2 = P RT(yt)2 = T 3/3 + O(T 2) we have
ξT
=

RT(xt)2
=

3(1 −˜bT) + op(1) .
If yt and xt are not cointegrated, then ˜bT has a nondegenerate limiting distribution
(see Phillips (1987a) for the linear case). On the other hand, if yt and xt are
cointegrated, then ˜bT converges to one in probability and therefore ξT converges
to zero.
Second, consider a Cramer-von Mises type of statistic based on the residuals
of a cointegration regression on the ranks:
eξT

3(1 −˜b2
T) + op(1) .
Hence, a two-step approach similar to the one suggested by Engle and Granger
(1987) can be seen as a two-sided version of a test based on ξT.
Third, the statistic ξT is related to the rank correlation coeﬃcient, which is
known as “Spearman’s rho”. Spearman’s rho is deﬁned as
rs = 1 −
6
T 3 −T
T
X
t=1
d2
t
(4.9)
(e.g. Kendall and Gibbons 1990, p.8). The statistic rs can therefore be seen as a
mapping of ξT into the interval [−1, 1]. If xt and yt are cointegrated, Spearman’s
rho converges in probability to one as T →∞.
Theorem 4.2 implies that, if f(xt) and g(yt) are independent random walk
sequences, we have
T −1d[aT] ⇒a(A1 −A3) + (1 −a)(A2 −A4) ,
where A1, . . . , A4 are independent random variables with an arcsine distribution.
Since Theorem 5.2 allows for heteroscedastic and serially correlated increments,
the asymptotic distributions of the diﬀerences dt is not aﬀected by weak forms of
heteroskedasticity and short run serial correlation.
Power. Under the alternative of a cointegration relationship as given in (4.6) we
have
T −1d[aT]
=
T −1 
RT[T −1/2g(yt)] −RT[T −1/2f(xt)]
	
=
T −1 
RT[T −1/2f(xt) + op(1)] −RT[T −1/2f(xt)]
	
⇒
0 .
Hence, κT and ξT converge to zero as T →∞, i.e., both rank tests are consistent.

Apart from this general statement it is quite diﬃcult to obtain analytical re-
sults for the (local) power of the test. Nevertheless, some interesting properties of
the rank test can be observed when the parametric analog of the ranked diﬀerences
is considered. Let the normalized diﬀerence of the series be deﬁned as
δt = yt
¯σy
−xt
¯σx
,
where yt and xt are I(1), E(yt) = E(xt) = 0 for all t, and ¯σ2
x, ¯σ2
y denote the
respective long run variances (cf Deﬁnition 4.1). Accordingly, a parametric analog
of the statistic ξT is constructed as
DT = 1
T 2
T
X
t=1
δ2

(4.10)
and under the null hypothesis of two uncorrelated random walk sequences, the
statistic is asymptotically distributed as
R
W1(a)2dr+
R
W2(a)2dr, where W1(a)
and W2 are independent standard Brownian motions. Under the alternative hy-
pothesis assume that ut = yt −βxt is stationary and β > 0. In this case we have
¯σy = β¯σx so that
DT = 1

It is seen that for large T the power of the test depends on the “signal-to-noise
ratio” β2¯σ2
x/σ2
u, where σ2
u is the variance of ut. As a consequence, the power of
the test is a monotonically increasing function of the parameter β. In contrast,
β does not aﬀect the power of a Dickey-Fuller cointegration test. As a result, we
expect that a test based on DT or its ranked counterpart ξT has more (less) power
than the Dickey-Fuller type cointegration test if β is large (small).
Extensions. So far I have assumed that f(xt) and g(yt) are independent I(1)
series. Of course, this assumption is quite restrictive and in many applications
it is reasonable to assume that the series are correlated. We therefore relax this
assumption and instead assume that f(xt) and g(yt) converge to two correlated
Brownian motions W1(a) and W2(a) with correlation coeﬃcient
ρ = E[W1(1)W2(1)] .

4.2. RANK TESTS FOR UNIT ROOTS

Since f(xt) and g(yt) are not observed it is not possible to estimate ρ directly.
Rather I will investigate the relationship between ρ and the expected correlation
coeﬃcient of the rank diﬀerences

If there exists an (asymptotic) one-to-one relationship between ρ and E(ρR
T ), then
it is possible to derive the limiting distributions of the test statistics. Unfortu-
nately, the relationship between ρ and E(ρR
T ) is very complicated and an analytical
evaluation appears intractable. Therefore, Monte Carlo, simulations are employed
to approximate the functional relationship between the two parameters.
Figure 5.4 presents the estimated relation between ρ and E(ρR
T ) using 5000
Monte Carlo replications with T = 100. It is seen that the correlation between
the ranked diﬀerences ρR
T tends to underestimate ρ in absolute value. However,
the diﬀerence is small for moderate values of ρ, ρR
T can be used as a ﬁrst guess of
ρ. This suggests that for small values of ρ, the test statistic can be corrected in a
similar manner as in the linear case:
ξ∗
T = ξ/bσ2
∆d
and
κ∗
T = κT/bσ∆d ,
(4.12)
where

Critical values for the corrected statistic ξ∗
T and κ∗
T are presented in Table A.5.1
in the appendix to this chapter. If the absolute value of ρ is close to one, this
correction performs poorly, however, and a more precise correction is required. In
general, the critical values of the statistics ξ∗
T and κ∗
T depend on the correlation
coeﬃcient ρ or - by using the relationship between ρ and E(ρR
T ), on E(ρR
T ). Let
cα
ξ (ρ) denote the critical value of ξ∗
T with respect to the signiﬁcance level of α.
Using the relationship between ρ and E(ρR
T ), the critical value may alternatively
be expressed as
cα
ξ (ρ) = cα
ξ (0)λα
ξ (EρR

Unfortunately, the determination of the function λα

that an approximation is obtained using Monte Carlo simulations. Speciﬁcally I
use 5000 Monte Carlo replications with T = 100 in the range ρ = [−0.98, −0.96, . . . ,
0.96, 0.98]. For the resulting 99 values of λα

Table A.5.1 for critical values).
Furthermore, it is possible to generalize the test in order to test for cointegra-
tion among the k + 1 variables yt, x1t, . . . , xkt, where it is assumed that g(yt) and
fj(xjt) (j = 1, . . . , k) are monotonic functions. Let RT(xt) = [RT(x1t), . . . , RT(xkt)]′
be a k × 1 vector and ebT is the least-squares estimate from a regression of RT(yt)
on RT(xt). Using the residuals
˜ut = RT(yt) −eb′
TRT(xt).
a multivariate rank statistic is obtained from the normalized sum of squares of
the residuals:

4.3
A rank test for neglected nonlinearity
Whenever the rank test for cointegration indicates a stable long run relationship, it
is interesting to know whether the cointegration relationship is linear or nonlinear.
For a convenient representation of such null and alternative hypotheses I follow
Granger (1995) and write the nonlinear relationship as
yt = γ0 + γ1xt + f ∗(xt) + ut ,
(4.15)

4.3. A RANK TEST FOR NEGLECTED NONLINEARITY
145
where γ0 + γ1xt is the linear part of the relationship. Under the null hypothesis it
is assumed that f ∗(xt) = 0 for all t. If f ∗(xt) is unknown, it may be approximated
by Fourier series (e.g. Gallant 1981) or a neural network (Lee, White and Granger
1993). Here we suggest to use the multiple of the rank transformation θRT(xt)
instead of f ∗(xt).
It is interesting to note that the rank transformation is to some extent related
to the neural network approach suggested by Lee, White and Granger (1993). If xt
is a k×1 vector of “input variables” and α is a corresponding vector of coeﬃcients,
the neural network approach approximates f ∗(xt) by Pq
j=1 βjψ(x′
tαj), where ψ(·)
has the properties of a cumulated distribution function. A function often used in
practice is the logistic ψ(x) = x/(1 −x). In our context, xt is a scalar variable, so
that the neural network term simpliﬁes to βψ(αxt). Using T −1RT(xt) = bFT(xt),
where bFT(xt) is the empirical distribution function, the rank transformation can
be motivated by letting ψ(αxt) be the empirical distribution function with the
attractive property that the parameter α can be dropped due to the invariance of
the rank transformation.
If it is assumed that xt is exogenous and ut is white noise with ut ∼N(0, σ2),
a score test statistic is obtained as the T · R2 of the least-squares regression
˜ut = c0 + c1xt + c2RT(xt) + et ,
(4.16)
where ˜ut = yt −˜γ0 −˜γ1xt and ˜γ0 and ˜γ1 are the least-squares estimates from a
regression of yt on a constant and xt.
A problem with applying the usual asymptotic theory to derive the limiting
null distribution of the test statistic is that the regression (4.16) involves the
nonstationary variables xt and RT(xt). However under some (fairly restrictive)
assumptions, the following theorem shows that under the null hypothesis c2 = 0
the score statistic is asymptotically χ2 distributed.
THEOREM 4.3 Let xt =
tP
j=1
vj and
yt = γ0 + γ1xt + ut ,
where it is assumed that vt is I(0) and ut is white noise with E(ut) = 0 and

146
CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR MODELS
E(u2
t) = σ2
u. As T →∞, the score statistic for H0 : c2 = 0 in the regression
(4.16) has an asymptotic χ2 distribution with one degree of freedom.
Proof: It is convenient to introduce the matrix notation:
X1 =



x1

...

xT


and X2 =


RT(x1)
...
RT(xT)

,
y = [y1, . . . , yT]′ and ˜u = [˜u1, . . . , ˜uT]′. With this notation, the score statistic can
be written as
T · R2 = 1
˜σ2(ˆβ2)2[X′
2X2 −X′
2X1(X′
1X1)−1X′
1X2] ,
where ˆβ2 is the least-squares estimator of β2 in the regression y = X1β1 + X2β2 +
u and ˜σ2 = ˜u′˜u/T.
As shown by Park and Phillips (1988), the least-squares
estimator in a regression with strictly exogenous I(1) regressors is conditionally
normally distributed, so that conditional on X = [X1, X2], ˜β2 is asymptotically
distributed as N(0, V2), where
V2 = σ2
u[X′
2X2 −X′
2X1(X′
1X1)−1X′
1X2]−1.
Since ˜σ2
u converges weakly to σ2
u it follows that T · R2 has an asymptotic χ2
distribution with one degree of freedom. ■
Unfortunately, the assumptions of Theorem 4.3 are too restrictive to provide
a useful result for practical situations.
In many situations, the errors ut are
found to be serially correlated and the regressor xt may be endogenous. However,
using standard techniques for cointegration regressions (Saikonnen 1991, Stock
and Watson 1993) the test can be modiﬁed to accommodate serially correlated
errors and endogenous regressors. For this purpose assume that
ut
=
E(ut|∆xt, ∆xt±1, ∆xt±2, . . .) + vt

and vt admits the autoregressive representation
vt =

X
j=1
αjvt−j + εt ,
where the roots of the lag polynomial α(B) = 1 −α1B −α2B2 −· · · are bounded
away rom the unit circle.
Under the null hypothesis of linear cointegration we thus have the representa-

(see Stock and Watson 1993 and Inder 1995).
A test for non-linear cointegration can be obtained by truncating the inﬁnite
sums appropriately and forming T ·R2 for the regression of the residuals ˜εt on the
regressors of (4.17) and RT(xt). Along the lines of Theorem 4.3 it can be shown
that the resulting score statistic is asymptotically χ2 distributed under the null
hypothesis of a linear cointegration relationship.
4.4
Nonlinear short run dynamics
In recent papers by Bierens (1997a,b) and Vogelsang (1998a,b) it was observed
that it is possible to construct test statistics that asymptotically do not depend
on parameters involved in the short run dynamics of the process. Accordingly,
it is not necessary to estimate the nuisance parameters such as the coeﬃcients
for the lagged diﬀerences in a Dickey-Fuller regression or the “long run variance”
(2π times the spectral density at frequency zero) by using a kernel estimate as in
Phillips and Perron (1988). Such an approach is called “model free” in Bierens
(1997a) and “nonparametric” in Bierens (1997b).
Albeit both terms may be
somewhat misleading, I follow Bierens (1997b) and use the term “nonparametric”.
In fact, it is diﬃcult to think of any test, which is “less parametric”.
The idea behind this approach is the following. Under suitable conditions on
the sequence ε1, ε2, . . . the functional central limit theorem (FCLT) implies
T −1/2
[aT]
X
t=1
εt ⇒¯σW(a) .
(4.18)

148
CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR MODELS
In what follows I consider tests, which by construction do not depend on the
parameter ¯σ2, asymptotically.
To test the hypothesis that yt is I(0) against the alternative yt ∼I(1), Tanaka
(1990) and Kwiatkowski et al. (1992) suggest an LM type test statistic given by
ϱT =
T −2
TP
t=1
Y 2
t
T −1
TP
t=1
y2
t
,
(4.19)
where Yt = y1 + · · · + yt denotes the partial sum process and it is assumed that
yt is white noise. If yt is serially correlated, the denominator is replaced by the
estimated long run variance (cf Kwiatkowski et al. 1992). Note that ϱT is the
(normalized) variance ratio of the partial sums and the original series. This test
statistic is therefore referred to as the “variance ratio statistic”.
In contrast to Kwiatkowski et al. (1992), the variance ratio statistic is em-
ployed to test the null hypothesis that yt is I(1) against the alternative yt ∼I(0).
Thus, our test ﬂips the null and alternative hypothesis of the test suggested by
Kwiatkowski et al. (1992). The following theorem presents the limiting null dis-
tribution of such a test procedure.
THEOREM 4.4 Let yt ∼I(1). Then, as T →∞, we have
T −1ϱT ⇒

It is important to notice that the null distribution does not depend on nuisance
parameters. This is due to the fact that the parameter ¯σ2 cancels in the variance
ratio. The following theorem shows that the test is consistent against stationary
alternatives and the usual class of local alternatives (e.g. Phillips 1987b).
THEOREM 4.5 Let yt be stationary with the Wold representation yt =

Under the local alternative φT = 1 −c/T in yt = φTyt−1 + εt the limiting
distribution is given by

R 1

,
where Jc(a) represents an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process deﬁned as Jc(a) =

0 e(a−s)cdW(s).
Proof: Under a stationary alternative we have
T −2 X

Using these results and T −1

Under the sequence of local alternatives we have (cf Phillips 1987b)

Jc(a)
T −3/2Y[aT]
⇒

Jc(s)ds .
Therefore, the limiting distribution results from replacing the Brownian motion
W(a) in Theorem 4.4 by Jc(a). ■

CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR MODELS
Testing the cointegration rank. The variance ratio statistic for a nonpara-
metric unit root test can be generalized straightforwardly to test hypotheses on
the cointegration rank in the spirit of Johansen (1988, 1991). To this end I make
the following assumption.
Assumption 4.2 There exists an invertible matrix Q = [γ, β]′, where γ and β
are linearly independent n×q and n×(n−q) matrices, respectively, with 0 ≤q < n
such that
Qyt =
"
γ′yt
β′yt
#
≡

ξt
ut
#
= zt
T −1/2ξ[aT] ⇒Wq(a)
T −2
T
X
t=1
utu′
t = op(1) ,
where Wq(a) is a q–dimensional Brownian motion with unit covariance matrix.
To allow for some general nonlinear processes generating ut, it is not assumed
that the “error correction term” ut is stationary. Instead I assume that the trend
component ξt is “variance dominating” in the sense that the variance of ξt diverges
with a faster rate than ut.
The dimension of the stochastic trend component ξt is related to the cointe-
gration rank of a linear system by q = n −r, where r is the rank of the matrix Π
in the VECM representation
∆yt = Πyt−1 + vt ,
(4.20)
and vt is a stationary error vector. In a linear system, the hypothesis on the
number of stochastic trends is equivalent to a hypothesis on the cointegration
rank as in Johansen (1988). However, since we do not assume that the process is
linear, the representation of the form (4.20) may not exist.
Our test statistic is based on the eigenvalues λj of the problem
|λjBT −AT| = 0 ,
(4.21)
where
AT =
T
X
t=1
yty′
t ,
BT =

4.4. NONLINEAR SHORT RUN DYNAMICS
151
and Yt = Pt
j=1 yj denotes the n-dimensional partial sum with respect to yt. The
eigenvalues of (4.21) are identical to the eigenvalues of the matrix RT = ATB−1
T .
For n = 1 the eigenvalue is identical to the statistic 1/ϱT and, thus, the test can
be seen as a generalization of the variance ratio statistic to multivariate processes.
The eigenvalues of (4.21) are given by
λj = η′
jATηj
η′
jBTηj
,
(4.22)
where ηj is the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue λj. If the vector ηj falls
inside the space spanned by the columns of γ, then η′
jATηj is Op(T 2) and η′
jBTηj
is Op(T 4) so that the eigenvalue is Op(T −2). On the other hand, if the eigenvector
ηj falls into the space spanned by the columns of β, it follows that T 2λj tends to
inﬁnity, as T →∞. Therefore, the test statistic
Λq = T 2
q
X
j=1
λj
(4.23)
has a nondegenerate limiting distribution, where λ1 ≤λ2 ≤· · · ≤λn denote the
eigenvalues of the matrix RT. In contrast, if the number of stochastic trends is
smaller than q, then Λq diverges to inﬁnity. The following theorem presents the
limiting null distribution for the test statistic Λq.
THEOREM 4.6 Assume that yt admits a decomposition as in Assumption 4.2
with 0 < q ≤n. Then, as T →∞

From this theorem it follows that the asymptotic distribution of the q smallest
eigenvalues of the problem (4.21) does not depend on nuisance parameters and,
thus, we do not need to select the lag order of the VAR process as in Johansen’s
approach or the truncation lag as for the test of Quintos (1998).
Including Deterministic Terms. To accommodate processes with a nonzero
mean assume that the mean function E(yt) = Cdt is a linear function of deter-
ministic variables like a constant, time trend or dummy variables stacked in the
k × 1 vector dt and C is a matrix (or vector) of unknown coeﬃcients. In this case
it is natural to remove the mean of the time series by using the residuals from the

4.4. NONLINEAR SHORT RUN DYNAMICS
153
regression yt = bCdt + but, where bC denotes the least-squares estimator of C. The
partial sums are then constructed by using the residuals bYt = bu1 + · · · + but. This
procedure is referred to as “OLS-detrending”.3
In cointegrated systems it is often the case that the deterministic terms are
constrained under the cointegration hypothesis. In particular, it is assumed that
yt has a linear time trend, whereas the cointegrating relations β′yt have a constant
mean. This speciﬁcation of the mean function is used if the model is estimated
with Johansen’s ML procedure including unrestricted constants.
This speciﬁ-
cation implies that the linear combinations ut = β′yt are adjusted for a mean,
whereas the vector of permanent components ξt = γ′yt is adjusted for a time
trend. Thus, in order to impose these restrictions on the deterministic terms,
estimates for the matrices β and γ are needed. A possible way to estimate these
matrices is to use the principle component estimator. An attractive property of
this estimator is that in this case γ is estimated to be the orthogonal complement
of the cointegration matrix. It follows, that this matrix is estimated with the
same convergence rate as the cointegration matrix (cf Harris 1997).
Let bβ and bγ denote the estimates from a principal component procedure. Then,
the adjusted vector of time series results as
x∗
t =
"
bγ′yt −ba0 −ba1t
bβ′yt −bb
#
,
where ba0 and ba1 are the least-squares estimates from a regression of bξt = bγ′yt on a
constant and a time trend and bb denotes the mean of but = bβ′yt. Then, the statistic
is computed by using x∗
t instead of yt and the critical values for a test with time
trend are applied. Note that
x∗
t =
"
γ′yt −E(γ′yt) + op(T 1/2)
β′yt −E(β′yt) + Op(1)
#
and, thus, the diﬀerences between the estimated and true nonstationary compo-
nents are asymptotically negligible but the transitory components are measured
3Alternatively, the parameters in C may be estimated by applying quasi diﬀerences to the
nonstationary components as in Xiao and Phillips (1999).

with an nonvanishing error. However, since the transitory components are asymp-
totically irrelevant under the null hypothesis, this does not aﬀects the null distri-
bution of the test.

Small sample properties
Rank tests. To investigate the small sample properties of the rank tests for non-
linear cointegration I follow Gonzalo (1994) and generate two time series according
to the model equations

The variable xt is obtained from the random walk zt by using the inverse function
xt = f −1(zt).
Under the null hypothesis H0 : α = 1 there is no cointegration relationship
between the series. If in addition β = 0 and ρ = 0, then xt and yt are two indepen-
dent random walks with serially uncorrelated increments. For this speciﬁcation,
Table 5.1 reports the rejection frequencies of diﬀerent cointegration tests. The
rank tests κT and ξT are computed as in (4.7) and (4.8) and “CDF” indicates the
Dickey-Fuller t-test applied to the residuals of a linear regression of yt on xt and
a constant. The results for the linear process is given in the left half of Table 5.1
indicated by f(x) = x. It might be surprising to see that for β = 1 the rank test
is much more powerful than the CDF test if α is close to one. As was argued in
Section 5.3, this is due to the fact that the rank statistics depend on the parameter
β, whereas the Dickey-Fuller type test for cointegration does not depend on β.
In fact, the simulation results indicate that the power of the rank tests are very
sensitive to the value of β. For β = 0.5 the Dickey-Fuller tests perform better,
whereas for β = 1 the rank tests clearly outperform the Dickey-Fuller type tests.

4.5. SMALL SAMPLE PROPERTIES
157
It should also be noted that the rank test does not require to estimate the
cointegration parameter β. Accordingly, this test has the same power as for the
case of a known cointegration relationship. Furthermore, the rank tests impose
the one-sided hypothesis that f(xt) is an increasing function.
Since the rank tests are invariant to a monotonic transformation of the vari-
ables, the power function is the same as for the linear case. Comparing the power
of the CDF test with the rank counterparts, it turns out that the power of the
CDF test may drop dramatically for nonlinear alternatives (see also Granger and
Hallman (1991b)), while the rank test performs as well as in the linear case. In
particular, for the case f(x) = log(x) the parametric CDF test performs quite
poorly.
To study the ability of the modiﬁed statistics suggested in Section 5.3 to
account for correlated random walks, I simulate correlated data by varying the
correlation coeﬃcient in the range ρ = −0.9, . . . , 0.9. The statistics κ∗
T and ξ∗
T
use a correction that is similar to the correction in the linear case. As argued in
Section 5.3, this test statistic should perform well if the correlation is moderate.
For more substantial correlation coeﬃcients, the improved statistics κ∗∗
T and ξ∗∗
T
deﬁned in (4.13) should be used.
Table 5.2 presents the empirical sizes for testing the null hypothesis of no
cointegration with β = 0 and α = 1. It turns out that the statistic κ∗
T performs
well in the range ρ ∈[−0.4, 0.4], whereas the statistic ξ∗
T should only be used for
a small correlation in the range ρ ∈[−0.2, 0.2]. In contrast, the statistics κ∗∗
T and
ξ∗∗
T turn out to be very robust against a correlation among xt and yt.
Next, consider the small sample properties of the rank test for nonlinear coin-
tegration suggested in Section 5.4. It is assumed that yt and xt are cointegrated
so that yt −βf(xt) is stationary. By setting α = 0.5 I generate serially correlated
errors and by letting ρ = 0.5, the variable xt is correlated with the errors ut,
that is, xt is endogenous. The rank test for nonlinear cointegration is obtained by
regressing yt on xt, yt−1, ∆xt+1, ∆xt, ∆xt−1 and a constant. The score statistic is
computed as T ·R2 from a regression of the residuals on the same set of regressors
and the ranks RT(xt).

158
CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR MODELS
To study the power of the tests I consider three diﬀerent nonlinear functions.
As a benchmark I perform the tests using f(xt) instead of the ranks RT(xt). Of
course, using the true functional form, which is usually unknown in practice, the
test is expected to have better power than the test based on the ranks. Surpris-
ingly, the results of the Monte Carlo simulations (see Table 5.3) suggest that the
rank test may even be (slightly) more powerful than the parametric test, whenever
the nonlinear term enters the equation with a small weight (β = 0.01). However,
the gain in power is quite small and falls in the range of the simulation error. In
any case, the rank test performs very well and seems to imply no important loss
of power in comparison to the parametric version of the test.

4.5. SMALL SAMPLE PROPERTIES
159
Nonlinear short run dynamics. Next, I consider the small sample properties of
nonparametric tests of Section 5.5 that were suggested to allow for nonlinear short
run dynamics. Four nonlinear processes are considered, where the assumptions of
the Dickey-Fuller test are violated. The ﬁrst process it the bilinear process:
(bilin):
∆yt = φεt−1∆yt−1 + εt .
(4.25)
Note that the correlation between εt−1 and ∆yt−1 implies a linear time trend in
yt. The second process is a variable coeﬃcient model of the form
(VCM):
∆yt = αt∆yt−1 + εt with αt = cos(2πt/T) .
(4.26)
Kim (1999) shows that in such an “evolutionary model” the augmented Dickey-
Fuller test has a limiting distribution that is diﬀerent from the distribution derived
in Dickey and Fuller (1979).
Third, I consider a threshold autoregressive process given by
(TAR):
yt =



yt−1 + εt
for |εt| < 2σε
0.8yt−1 + εt
for |εt| ≥2σε
.
(4.27)
The fourth process is a stochastic unit root process as considered in Granger and
Swanson (1997):
(STUR):
yt = αtyt−1 + εt with αt = 0.4 + 0.6αt−1 + ηt ,
(4.28)
where E(ε2
t) = 1 and E(η2
t ) = 0.012. Note that E(αt) = 1.
The empirical sizes computed from 10,000 realizations with T = 200 are pre-
sented in Table 5.4. All tests allow for a linear trend. For the TAR and STUR
model, the size bias of the ADF(1) test is very small and the variance ratio statis-
tic ϱT performs only marginally better. However, for the bilinear model and the
VCM model, the size bias of the ADF(1) test is more substantial. In these cases
the nonparametric statistic ϱ performs much better.
To investigate the properties of the nonparametric cointegration test I generate
data according to the “canonical” process (Toda 1994) with MA(1) errors

where E(ε2

2t) = 1 and E(ε1tε2t) = θ. To test the hypothesis r = 1, I
let φ1 = 0 and φ2 = −0.2. Under the alternative I set φ1 ∈{−0.05, −0.1, −0.2}.
Furthermore, I let θ = 0 and θ = 0.8 to investigate the impact of the error
correlation. The sample size is T = 200 and 10,000 samples are generated to
compute the rejection frequencies of the tests.
For Johansen’s LR trace test, the process is approximated by a VAR[p] process,
where p is 4 and 12, respectively. The respective tests are denoted by LR(4) and
LR(12). Unrestricted constants are included in each equation. The nonparametric
test statistic is denoted by Λq and the critical values are taken from Table A.5.3 in
the appendix to this chapter. First, consider the results for testing H0 : q = r = 1
presented in Table 5.5. From the empirical sizes it turns out that for θ = 0, a
VAR[4] model is not suﬃcient to approximate the inﬁnite VAR process, whereas
a VAR[12] approximation yields an accurate size. The nonparametric statistic Λq
possesses a negligible size bias, only. The power of Λq is substantially smaller than
the power of LR(4) but clearly higher than the power of LR(12). Similar results
apply for the tests letting θ = 0.8. However, the LR(12) statistic now possesses a
moderate size bias, whereas Λq is nearly unbiased. Moreover, the power of Λq is
closer to the (favorable) LR(4) statistic than in the case of θ = 0.
We now turn to the test of H0 : r = 0. Under the null hypothesis the diﬀerence
of the variables are generated by a multivariate MA process. In this case, all three
test statistic are substantially biased, where the size bias does not depend on the
parameter θ. Although the size bias diﬀers for the three tests, the diﬀerences are
moderate and some general conclusions with respect to the relative power of the
tests can be drawn. For θ = 0 and φ1 close to unity, the nonparametric test Λq
is slightly more powerful than the LR(4) test, whereas for φ1 = 0.8 the power of
LR(4) is slightly higher. Finally, the power of LR(12) is much smaller than the
power of the other two tests. For θ = 0.8 a diﬀerent picture emerges. The relative
power of Λq drops substantially and for φ1 close to one, the power is even lower
than the power of the LR(12) test. The results for a model with a linear time
trend are qualitatively similar and are not presented here.

Empirical applications
The term structure of interest rates. The rank tests are applied to test for
a possible nonlinear cointegration between interest rates with diﬀerent time to
maturity. Recent empirical work suggests that interest rates with a diﬀerent time
to maturity are nonlinearly related.4 The data set consists of monthly yields of
government bonds with diﬀerent time to maturity as published by the Deutsche
Bundesbank. The sample runs from 1967(i) through 1995(xii) yielding 348 monthly
observations for each variable.
The nonlinear relationship between yields for diﬀerent times to maturity can
be motivated as follows. Let rt denote the yield of a one-period bond and Rt
represents the yield of a two-period bond at time t. The expectation theory of
the term structure implies that
Rt = φt + 0.5rt + 0.5Et(rt+1) ,
(4.30)
where Et denotes the conditional expectation with respect to the relevant infor-
mation set available at period t and φt represents the risk premium.
Letting
rt+1 = Et(rt+1) + 2νt and subtracting rt from both sides of (4.30) gives
Rt −rt = 0.5(rt+1 −rt) + φt + νt .
Assuming that rt is I(1) and φt + νt is stationary implies that Rt and rt are
(linearly) cointegrated (e.g. Wolters 1995). However, if the risk premium depends
on rt such that φt = f ∗(rt) + ηt with ηt stationary, then the yields are nonlinearly
cointegrated:
Rt −f(rt) = ut ∼I(0) ,
where f(rt) = rt+f ∗(rt) and ut = 0.5(rt+1−rt)+ηt+νt. Note that ut is correlated
with rt and, therefore, rt is endogenous. Furthermore, if the sampling interval is
shorter than the time to maturity, then the errors are serially correlated even if
νt and ηt are white noise.
4See, e.g., Campbell and Galbraith (1993), Pfann et al. (1996), and the reference therein.

164
CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR MODELS
To test whether interest rates possess a (nonlinear) cointegration relationship
various tests for unit roots are applied ﬁrst. Neither the conventional Dickey-
Fuller t-test nor the ranked counterpart discussed in Section 5.2 reject the null
hypothesis that the interest rates are I(1) (not presented).
The results presented in Table 5.6 highlight the cointegration properties of
yields with diﬀerent time to maturity. The parametric as well as the rank tests
indicate a cointegration relationship between the short term bonds, while the
evidence for cointegration between short run and long run bonds (e.g. R1 and
R10) is much weaker.
Furthermore, the rank test for nonlinear cointegration
(“nonlin”) does not reveal any evidence against a linear cointegration relationship.
All values of the test statistic suggested in Section 5.4 are much smaller than the
critical value of 3.84. This result suggests that a linear version of the expectation
theory for the term structure yields an appropriate description of the long run
relationship between interest rates with diﬀerent time to maturity.

4.6. EMPIRICAL APPLICATIONS

The relationship between dual-class shares. In an early paper on cointe-
gration Granger (1986, p. 218) states that “[i]f xt, yt are a pair of prices from
a jointly eﬃcient, speculative market, they cannot be cointegrated.” The reason
is that whenever two variables are cointegrated, there exists an error correction
representation so that at least one variable can be forecasted by using the lagged
error correction term.
Recently, however, this statement was called into question in a number of
studies. For example, Kasa (1992) ﬁnds evidence for common stochastic trends
(and thus of cointegration) in international stock markets. Kehr (1997) shows
that stock prices traded at diﬀerent regional markets in Germany are cointegrated
and Kr¨amer (1999) and Dittmann (1998) ﬁnd (fractional) cointegration between
diﬀerent classes of stocks of the same or very similar German companies.
These conﬂicting views of the eﬃcient market hypothesis can be resolved by as-
suming a nonlinear error correction mechanism (ECM). The idea is that small de-
viations from the long run relationship are not predictable as claimed by Granger
(1986). If the deviations become large, however, an eﬀective adjustment process
prevents stock prices of fundamentally related assets from drifting too far away.
The economic reason behind such a nonlinear adjustment process is that transac-
tion costs make it unproﬁtable to exploit small deviations from the fundamental
relationship. When undervaluation (or overvaluation) becomes more substantial,
agents will buy (or sell) the respective assets until the fundamental relationship is
re-established. This reasoning naturally leads to a nonlinear version of the error
correction model (e.g. Escribano and Mira 1998).
We apply a variety of cointegration tests to time series data of pairs of Ger-
man voting and non-voting shares issued by the same ﬁrm (dual-class ﬁrm). Daily
stock price data adjusted for stock splits, dividends and other corporate events
are from the “Deutsche Finanzdatenbank” (DFDB) in Karlsruhe. We use loga-
rithms of stock prices in our statistical analysis. According to the criteria liquidity
and availability of long time series, a sample of 6 dual-class ﬁrms is chosen for
examination. Among those four are contained in the index of the 30 largest Ger-
man blue-chip stocks (DAX), the remaining two are in the German mid-cap index

166
CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR MODELS
MDAX. In Table 5.7 the sample is further described.
German corporate law requires that holders of non-voting shares must be com-
pensated for the lack of corporate control by a dividend advantage. This usually
takes the form of a minimum preferred dividend (stated as percentage of par value)
which will be carried forward in particular years of dividend omissions (cumula-
tive preferred dividend). Both the cumulative (past) preferred dividends and the
current preferred dividends have to be paid out before the common shareholders
can receive anything. In addition some ﬁrms commit themselves to pay the non-
voting shareholders a certain (non-cumulative) amount in excess of the common
stock dividend.
To test for (linear) cointegration I ﬁrst compute the augmented Dickey-Fuller
(ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) test applied to the residuals of a OLS cointe-
grating regression (cf. Phillips and Ouliaris 1990). For the ADF test ten lagged
diﬀerences and a constant are included in the regression. The truncation lag for
the Phillips-Perron test on the residuals is set to 20. Using these tests, only a weak
evidence for cointegration is found for RWE, and RHM (see Table 5.8), whereas in
the other cases, the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected at a signiﬁcance
level of 0.05. Applying Johansen’s (1988) likelihood-ratio test procedure based on
a VAR[10] model with a constant restricted to the cointegration relationship gives
a slightly diﬀerent picture. This test ﬁnds a cointegration relationship for RWE,
MAN and BMW. In the remaining cases, the LR statistics are insigniﬁcant.
An important problem is, however, that these test procedures are based on the
assumption of a linear process and thus may be problematical in applications using
ﬁnancial time series data. Applying the nonparametric test statistic suggested in
Section 5.5, the evidence for cointegration decrease substantially. Only for BMW
the test clearly points to a cointegration relationship. For RHM a cointegration
relationship is found at the 0.05 signiﬁcance level but not on the 0.01 signiﬁcance
level. The diminished evidence may be due to an improved robustness against
nonlinear short run dynamics. However, it may also be due to a lack of power
compared to the parametric counterparts.
Interestingly, the rank tests for cointegration unambiguously reject the hypoth-

4.6. EMPIRICAL APPLICATIONS
167
esis of no cointegration. This may be the result of a structural instability of the
cointegration relationships, that may be represented by a nonlinear cointegration
relationship. In fact, as shown by Breitung and Wulﬀ(1999), there is a strong
evidence for structural changes in RWE, MAN, BMW, and BOSS. Furthermore,
tests for nonlinearity in the error correction mechanism suggest that the stock
prices of MAN, RHM and BOSS indeed react nonlinearly to a deviation to the
long run relationship in the previous period.

CHAPTER 4. INFERENCE IN NONLINEAR MODELS

Chapter 5
Conclusions and outlook
The previous chapters give an account of recent research in multiple time se-
ries analysis that intends to bridge the gap between reduced form VAR models
used in Johansen’s (1995) work and structural models based on sets of simultane-
ous equations advocated by the inﬂuential Cowles commission. A variant of this
methodology was developed by Sims (1986) and others who suggest to impose
restrictions on the covariance matrix of the errors in order to identify macroe-
conomic shocks. The latter approach became recently very popular and plays a
dominating role during the last few years. It was argued that the structural frame-
work is able to account for the cointegration properties of the data so that the long
run relationship of the variables can be given a structural interpretation. This is
an important advantage over the (reduced form) cointegration analysis that can
only indicate some stationary linear combination of the variables. Whether the
observed long run relationship is a “money demand schedule” or a ”money supply
schedule” or a mixture of both cannot be decided without imposing additional
assumption needed to identify the structure.
It is sometimes argued (see e.g. M¨oller 1993) that it does not make sense to
attach the usual structural interpretation to the long run solution of a system
because the variables in a long run relationship cannot be qualiﬁed as dependent
and predetermined variables.
This is indeed correct as long as the short run
dynamics of the system are left unspeciﬁed. However, if the dynamic structure
173

174
CHAPTER 5. CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
(that is the long and short run parameters) is identiﬁed appropriately, the error
correction representation is a particular reformulation of the structural model and
structural inference applies in the usual way (Hsiao 1997).
If the errors of the system are identiﬁed as economic shocks, it is attractive to
impose cointegration relationships as it allows to qualify shocks to be transitory
or permanent. For example, it is often assumed that demand shocks aﬀect real
quantities only in the short run, whereas supply shocks may have a permanent
eﬀect on variables like output and unemployment. As demonstrated in Chapter 3,
such assumptions can easily be imposed in a structural cointegrated VAR model.
Using impulse response analysis the dynamic eﬀects of structural stocks on the
variables of interest can be studied.
To discuss the alternative approaches to draw structural inference from linear
dynamic models it was assumed that suﬃcient identifying restrictions can be de-
rived from economic theory so that the remaining problem is how to impose these
assumptions on the cointegrated VAR system. In many applications, however,
economic theory gives only a vague motivation of some structural properties but
the initial enthusiasm that fully speciﬁed models can be derived from some basic
assumptions on optimizing agents under limited resources is unwarranted. Usu-
ally, economic theory is not a “sharp theory” in the sense that it attach a prior
probability of one to a single structure and a probability of zero to all other struc-
tures (see also Leamer 1983). Rather, theoretical reasoning suggests that some
speciﬁcations are more plausible than others. Empirical work should therefore
start with speciﬁcations that correspond best to the preferred theoretical model
and try out other speciﬁcations that are similarly plausible.
Such a “robustness analysis” is often encountered in practice (for example
Bernanke and Mihow 1997, Cochrane 1998, Rudebush 1998).
Although it is
clearly desirable to have robust results for the range of all possible speciﬁcations
it is questionable to claim that robustness of the results is a necessary condition
for a credible empirical ﬁnding (e.g. Cooley and Dwyer 1998). First, it does not
seem sensible to claim for a “robust” judgement in the sense that it is always
be compatible with the addresses to the jury delivered from both the prosecutor

175
and the defense counsel. Of course the judge is in a comfortable position if the
prosecutor and the defense counsel demand for the same judgement but it is unre-
alistic to claim that this should always be the case. Second, a result that is robust
against a change in the assumptions may simply demonstrate that the assump-
tions are uninformative. Why should we conﬁne ourselves to use uninformative
assumptions?
In many cases theoretical considerations give rise to a particular structural as-
sumption but is silent about other aspects of the model that have to be speciﬁed as
well. For example, (keynesian) money demand theory states that money demand
depends on output and interest rates so that an increase in output has a positive
eﬀect on money demand, whereas a raise in interest rates leads to a decrease in
the desired monetary base. For a dynamic analysis of the relationship between
money, output and interest rates, we need further structural assumptions on the
eﬀect of interest rates on output (such as an IS-schedule) and an equation with
interest rates as the dependent variable (e.g. a money supply function). Hence,
the structural system employs quite diﬀerent theoretical ingredients that may in-
teract in a complex way. Indeed, as argued forcefully by Sims (1980), the theory
of rational expectation implies that it does not make sense to specify structural
elements of the system in isolation. On the other hand, theoretical models that
try to model the all aspects of economic behaviour jointly are diﬃcult to handle
and yield structural models with nonlinear cross-equation constraints (see, e.g.,
Wickens 1982) that are not considered in this thesis. Future work should therefore
allow for more complex speciﬁcations. Examples for current research in that ﬁeld
are Johansen and Swensen (1999) and Kozicki and Tinsley (1988).
