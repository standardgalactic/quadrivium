CHAPTER P
Relativity Is More Than 100 Years Old
Positron emission tomography (PET) scans, the temperature of Earth’s
crust, smoke detectors, neon signs, carbon dating, and the warmth we
receive from the sun may seem to be disparate concepts. However, they
have a common theme: Albert Einstein’s Theory of Special Relativity.
When Einstein was asked about his innate curiosity, he replied:
The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for
existing. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity,
of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to
comprehend a little of this mystery every day.
Today, relativity theory is used in conjunction with other concepts of
physics to study ideas ranging from the structure of an atom to the
structure of the universe. Some of Einstein’s equations require working
with radical expressions, such as the expression given in Exercise 139 on
page 31; other equations use rational expressions, such as the expression
given in Exercise 64 on page 59.

structure in the photo above. By
studying particles moving at 
speeds that approach the speed of
light, physicists can confirm some
of the tenets of relativity theory.
Albert Einstein proposed relativity theory more than 100 years ago, 
in 1905.

The Real Number System
Sets
Human beings share the desire to organize and classify. Ancient astronomers classified
stars into groups called constellations. Modern astronomers continue to classify stars
by such characteristics as color, mass, size, temperature, and distance from Earth. In
mathematics it is useful to place numbers with similar characteristics into sets. The
following sets of numbers are used extensively in the study of algebra.
Natural numbers
Integers
Rational numbers
all terminating or repeating decimals
Irrational numbers
all nonterminating, nonrepeating decimals
Real numbers
all rational or irrational numbers
If a number in decimal form terminates or repeats a block of digits, then the number
is a rational number. Here are two examples of rational numbers.
0.75 is a terminating decimal.
is a repeating decimal. The bar over the 45 means that the digits 45 repeat
without end. That is, 
Rational numbers also can be written in the form 
where 
and

gers and 
Examples of rational numbers written in this form are

Therefore, all integers are rational
numbers.
When a rational number is written in the form 
the decimal form of the rational
number can be found by dividing the numerator by the denominator.
In its decimal form, an irrational number neither terminates nor repeats. For
example,
is a nonterminating, nonrepeating decimal and thus is an
irrational number. One of the best-known irrational numbers is pi, denoted by the
Greek symbol
. The number
is defined as the ratio of the circumference of a
circle to its diameter. Often in applications the rational number 3.14 or the rational
number 
is used as an approximation of the irrational number .
Every real number is either a rational number or an irrational number. If a real num-
ber is written in decimal form, it is a terminating decimal, a repeating decimal, or a non-
terminating and nonrepeating decimal.

The relationships among the various sets of numbers are shown in Figure P.1.

Prime numbers and composite numbers play an important role in almost every branch
of mathematics. A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive-
integer factors1 other than itself and 1. The 10 smallest prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,
13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. Each of these numbers has only itself and 1 as factors.
A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is not a prime number.
For example, 10 is a composite number because 10 has both 2 and 5 as factors. The 10 small-
est composite numbers are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 18.

Sophie Germain (1776–1831) was
born in Paris, France. Because
enrollment in the university she
wanted to attend was available only
to men, Germain attended under
the name of Antoine-August Le
Blanc. Eventually her ruse was dis-
covered, but not before she came
to the attention of Pierre Lagrange,
one of the best mathematicians of
the time. He encouraged her work
and became a mentor to her. A cer-
tain type of prime number is
named after her, called a Germain
prime number. It is a number p such
that p and 2p + 1 are both prime.
For instance, 11 is a Germain prime
because 2(11) + 1 = 23 and 11 and
23 are both prime numbers.
Germain primes are used in public
key cryptography, a method used
to send secure communications
over the Internet.
1A factor of a number divides the number evenly. For instance, 3 and 7 are factors of 21; 5 is not a
factor of 21.

Set
is a subset of set
if every element of
is also an element of B, and we write
For instance, the set of negative integers
is a subset of the set of
integers. The set of positive integers
(the natural numbers) is also a subset
of the set of integers.
Question • Are the integers a subset of the rational numbers?
The empty set, or null set, is the set that contains no elements. The symbol 
is
used to represent the empty set. The set of people who have run a 2-minute mile is the
empty set.
The set of natural numbers less than 6 is 
This is an example of a finite
set; all the elements of the set can be listed. The set of all natural numbers is an example
of an infinite set. There is no largest natural number, so all the elements of the set of natu-
ral numbers cannot be listed.
Sets are often written using set-builder notation. Set-builder notation can be used to
describe almost any set, but it is especially useful when writing infinite sets. For instance,
the set
natural numbers
is read as “the set of elements 
such that is a natural number.” By replacing with each
of the natural numbers, this becomes the set of positive even integers: 
.
The set of real numbers greater than 2 is written
real numbers
and is read “the set of 
such that 
is greater than 2 and 
is an element of the real
numbers.”
Much of the work we do in this text uses the real numbers. With this in mind, we will
frequently write, for instance, 
real numbers
in a shortened form as
where we assume that is a real number. 
EXAMPLE 2
Use Set-Builder Notation
List the four smallest elements in 
natural numbers
Solution
Because we want the four smallest elements, we choose the four smallest natural
numbers. Thus 
2, 3, and 4. Therefore, the four smallest elements of the set
natural numbers
are 1, 8, 27, and 64.

Union and Intersection of Sets

Absolute Value and Distance
The real numbers can be represented geometrically by a coordinate axis called a real
number line. Figure P.10 shows a portion of a real number line. The number associated
with a point on a real number line is called the coordinate of the point. The point corre-
sponding to zero is called the origin. Every real number corresponds to a point on the
number line, and every point on the number line corresponds to a real number.
The absolute value of a real number

the number line. For instance,

has two operations, addition and multiplica-
tion. When an expression contains more than one operation, the operations must be per-
formed in a specified order, as given by the Order of Operations Agreement.
The Order of Operations Agreement
If grouping symbols are present, evaluate by first performing the operations within
the grouping symbols, innermost grouping symbols first, while observing the order
given in steps 1 to 3.
Step 1
Evaluate exponential expressions.
Step 2
Do multiplication and division as they occur from left to right.
Step 3
Do addition and subtraction as they occur from left to right.

P.1
THE REAL NUMBER SYSTEM
One of the ways in which the Order of Operations
Agreement is used is to evaluate variable expressions. The
addends of a variable expression are called terms. The
terms for the expression at the right are 
and 
Observe that the sign of a term is the sign that
immediately precedes it.
The terms 
and 
are variable terms. The term 
is a constant
term. Each variable term has a numerical coefficient and a variable part. The numeri-
cal coefficient for the term 
is 3; the numerical coefficient for the term 
is 
the numerical coefficient for the term 
is 5; and the numerical coefficient for the term
is 
When the numerical coefficient is 1 or 
(as in 
and 
), the 1 is usually
not written.
To evaluate a variable expression, replace the variables by their given values and then
use the Order of Operations Agreement to simplify the result.

We can identify which properties of real numbers have been used to rewrite an expres-
sion by closely comparing the original and final expressions and noting any changes.
For instance, to simplify 
both the commutative property and associative property of
multiplication are used.
• Commutative property of multiplication
• Associative property of multiplication
To simplify 
use the distributive property.
• Distributive property
Terms that have the same variable part are called like terms. The distributive property
is also used to simplify an expression with like terms such as 
• Distributive property
Note from this example that like terms are combined by adding the coefficients of the
like terms.
Question • Are the terms 
and

Scientific Notation
The exponent theorems provide a compact method of writing very large or very small num-
bers. The method is called scientific notation.A number written in scientific notation has the
form 
where 
is an integer and 
The following procedure is used to
change a number from its decimal form to scientific notation.
For numbers greater than 10, move the decimal point to the position to the right of the
first digit. The exponent 
will equal the number of places the decimal point has been
moved. For example,
For numbers less than 1, move the decimal point to the right of the first nonzero digit. The
exponent 
will be negative, and its absolute value will equal the number of places the
decimal point has been moved. For example,
To change a number from scientific notation to its decimal form, reverse the proce-
dure. That is, if the exponent is positive, move the decimal point to the right the same num-
ber of places as the exponent. For example,
If the exponent is negative, move the decimal point to the left the same number of places
as the absolute value of the exponent. For example,
Most calculators display very large and very small numbers in scientific notation.

When

and
can be used to write exponential expressions such as 
in radical form. Use the denomi-
nator 
as the index of the radical and the numerator 
as the power of the radicand or as
the power of the radical. For example,
• Use the denominator 3 as the index of the radical 
and the numerator 2 as the power of the radical.
The equations
and
also can be used to write radical expressions in exponential form. For example,
• Use the index 2 as the denominator of the power and the 
exponent 3 as the numerator of the power.
The definition of

roots, and so on) of variable expressions. Consider

Recalling the definition of absolute value, we can write this more compactly as

value symbol. Consider 
when 
and when 
Case 1

Index
A radical is in simplest form if it meets all of the following criteria.
1. The radicand contains only powers less than the index. (
does not satisfy this
requirement because 5, the exponent, is greater than 2, the index.)
2. The index of the radical is as small as possible. (

3. The denominator has been rationalized. That is, no radicals occur in the

Doppler Effect Astronomers can approximate the dis-
tance to a galaxy by measuring its red shift, which is a
shift in the wavelength of light due to the velocity of the
galaxy. This is similar to the way the sound of a siren coming
toward you seems to have a higher pitch than the sound of
the siren moving away from you. A formula for red shift is 
where 
and 
are wavelengths of a certain frequency
of light. Calculate the red shift for a galaxy for which
meter and

Relativity Theory A moving object has energy, called
kinetic energy, because of its motion. The Theory of
Relativity, mentioned on page 1, uses the following formula
for kinetic energy.
When the speed of an object is much less than the speed of
light (
meters per second) the formula
is used. In each formula, 
is the velocity of the object in
meters per second, 
is its rest mass in kilograms, and is the
speed of light given previously. In a. through e., calculate the
percent error for each of the given velocities. The formula for
percent error is
a.
meters per second (speed of a speeding car on an
expressway)
b.
meters per second (speed of a commercial jet)
c.
meters per second (10% of the speed of
light)
d.
meters per second (50% of the speed of light)
e.
meters per second (90% of the speed of
light)
f. Use your answers from a. through e. to explain why the for-
mula for kinetic energy given by 
is adequate for most
of our common experiences involving motion (walking,
running, bicycling, driving, flying, and so on).
g. According to the Theory of Relativity, a particle (such as an
electron or a spacecraft) cannot reach the speed of light.

A monomial is a constant, a variable, or the product of a constant and one or more vari-
ables, with the variables having only nonnegative integer exponents.
z
7y
A number
A variable
The product of a constant
The product of a constant
and one variable
and several variables
The expression 
is not a monomial because it is the product of a constant and a vari-
able with a negative integer exponent.
The constant multiplying the variables is called the numerical coefficient or coeffi-
cient. For 7y, the coefficient is 7; for 
, the coefficient is 
. The coefficient of
z is 1 because 
Similarly, the coefficient of 
is 
because 
The degree of a monomial is the sum of the exponents of the variables. The degree
of a nonzero constant is 0. The constant zero has no degree.
7y
Degree is 1 because y = y1.
Degree is 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
Degree is 0.
A polynomial is the sum of a finite number of monomials. Each monomial is called
a term of the polynomial. The degree of a polynomial is the greatest of the degrees of the
terms. See Table P.1.
Terms that have exactly the same variables raised to the same powers are called like
terms. For example, 
and 
are like terms.

A binomial is a
simplified polynomial with two terms;
and
are binomials. A
trinomial is a simplified polynomial with three terms;
and
are trinomials. A nonzero constant, such as 5, is a constant polynomial.
Definition of the Standard Form of a Polynomial
The standard form of a polynomial of degree 
in the variable is
where 
and 
is a nonnegative integer. The coefficient 
is the leading
coefficient, and 
is the constant term.
EXAMPLE

Math Matters
The procedure used by the com-
puter to determine whether a
number is prime or composite is a
polynomial time algorithm, because
the time required can be estimated
using a polynomial. The procedure
used to factor a number is an expo-
nential time algorithm. In the field
of computational complexity, it is
important to distinguish between
polynomial time algorithms and
exponential time algorithms.
Example 8 illustrates that the poly-
nomial time algorithm can be run
in about 2 seconds, whereas the
exponential time algorithm
requires about 44 minutes!

Writing a polynomial as a product of polynomials is called factoring. Factoring is an impor-
tant procedure that is often used to simplify fractional expressions and to solve equations.
In this section, we consider only the factorization of polynomials that have integer
coefficients. Also, we are concerned only with factoring over the integers. That is, we
search only for polynomial factors that have integer coefficients.
Greatest Common Factor
The first step in the factorization of any polynomial is to use the distributive property to
factor out the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms of the polynomial. Given two
or more exponential expressions with the same prime number base or the same variable
base, the GCF is the exponential expression with the smallest exponent. For example,
is the GCF of 
and 
and
is the GCF of 
and 
The GCF of two or more monomials is the product of the GCFs of all the common
bases. For example, to find the GCF of 
and 
factor the coefficients into prime
factors and then write each common base with its smallest exponent.
The only common bases are 3 and 
The product of these common bases with their small-
est exponents is 
The GCF of 
and 
is 
The expressions 
and 
have a common binomial factor, which is
Thus the GCF of

Sometimes it is impossible to factor a polynomial into the product of two polynomi-
als having integer coefficients. Such polynomials are said to be nonfactorable over the
integers. For example, 
is nonfactorable over the integers because there are
no integers whose product is 7 and whose sum or difference is 3.
The trial method sometimes can be used to factor trinomials of the form 
which do not have a leading coefficient of 1. We use the factors of and to form trial bino-
mial factors. Factoring trinomials of this type may require testing many factors. To reduce
the number of trial factors, make use of the following points.
Points to Remember to Factor 
1. If the constant term of the trinomial is positive, the constant terms of the
binomials have the same sign as the coefficient 
in the trinomial.
2. If the constant term of the trinomial is negative, the constant terms of the
binomials have opposite signs.
3. If the terms of the trinomial do not have a common factor, then neither
binomial will have a common factor.
EXAMPLE 3
Factor a Trinomial of the Form 
Factor: 
Solution
Because the constant term of the trinomial is positive and the coefficient of the term is
negative, the constant terms of the binomials will both be negative. We start by finding
factors of the first term and factors of the constant term.
Use these factors to write trial factors. Use the FOIL method to see whether any of the
trial factors produce the correct middle term. If the terms of a trinomial do not have a
common factor, then a binomial factor cannot have a common factor (point 3). Such
trial factors need not be checked.

FACTORING
If you have difficulty factoring a trinomial, you may wish to use the following theo-
rem. It will indicate whether the trinomial is factorable over the integers.
Factorization Theorem
The trinomial 
with integer coefficients 
and 
can be factored
as the product of two binomials with integer coefficients if and only if 
is
a perfect square.
EXAMPLE 4
Apply the Factorization Theorem
Determine whether each trinomial is factorable over the integers.
a.
b.
Solution
a.
The coefficients of 
are
and 
Applying the
factorization theorem yields
Because 176 is not a perfect square, the trinomial is nonfactorable over the integers.
b.
The coefficients of 
are
and

Special Factoring
The product of a term and itself is called a perfect square. The exponents on variables of
perfect squares are always even numbers. The square root of a perfect square is one of
the two equal factors of the perfect square. To find the square root of a perfect square vari-
able term, divide the exponent by 2. For the examples in Table P.3, assume that the vari-
ables represent positive numbers.

Certain trinomials can be expressed as quadratic trinomials by making suitable vari-
able substitutions. A trinomial is quadratic in form if it can be written as
au2 + bu + c
= (a - 4)(a2 + 4a + 16)
a3 - 64 = a3 - 43
= (2a + b)(4a2 - 2ab + b2)
 8a3 + b3 = (2a)3 + b3
a3 - 64
8a3 + b3
a3 - b3 = (a - b)(a2 + ab + b2)
a3 + b3 = (a + b)(a2 - ab + b2)
16m2 - 40mn + 25n2 = (4m - 5n)2.
= 16m2 - 40mn + 25n2
= 16m2 - 20mn - 20mn + 25n2

A rational expression is a fraction in which the numerator and denominator are polyno-
mials. For example, the expressions below are rational expressions.

The domain of a rational expression is the set of all real numbers that can be used
as replacements for the variable. Any value of the variable that causes division by zero
is excluded from the domain of the rational expression. For example, the domain of
is the set of all real numbers except 0 and 5. Both 0 and 5 are excluded values because the
denominator 
equals zero when 
and also when 
Sometimes the
excluded values are specified to the right of a rational expression, as shown here. However,

procedure can be used to determine the least common denominator (LCD) of rational
expressions. It is similar to the process used to find the LCD of rational numbers.
Determining the LCD of Rational Expressions
1. Factor each denominator completely and express repeated factors using exponential
notation.
2. Identify the largest power of each factor in any single factorization. The LCD is the
product of each factor raised to its largest power.

Answer • Because you were traveling more slowly on the return trip, the return trip took longer
than the trip to your destination. More time was spent traveling at the slower speed.
Thus the average speed is less than the average of

Definition of a Complex Number
A complex number is a number of the form 
where 
and 
are real
numbers and 
The number 
is the real part of 
and 
is the
imaginary part.
EXAMPLE
• Real part: -3; imaginary part: 5
• Real part: 2; imaginary part: -6

Math Matters
The imaginary unit i is important
in the field of electrical engineer-
ing. However, because the letter i
is used by engineers as the symbol
for electric current, these engi-
neers use j for the complex unit.
Math Matters
It may seem strange to just invent
new numbers, but that is how
mathematics evolves. For instance,
negative numbers were not an
accepted part of mathematics
until well into the thirteenth cen-
tury. In fact, these numbers often
were referred to as “fictitious
numbers.”
In the seventeenth century, René
Descartes called square roots of
negative numbers “imaginary
numbers,” an unfortunate choice
of words, and started using the
letter i to denote these numbers.
These numbers were subjected to
the same skepticism as negative
numbers.
It is important to understand that
these numbers are not imaginary
in the dictionary sense of the
word. This misleading word is
similar to the situation of negative
numbers being called fictitious.
If you think of a number line, then
the numbers to the right of zero
are positive numbers and the num-
bers to the left of zero are negative
numbers. One way to think of an
imaginary number is to visualize it
as up or down from zero.
Definition of i
The imaginary unit, designated by the letter i, is the number such that i2 = -1.
Definition of an Imaginary Number
If 
is a positive real number, then 
The number 
is called an
imaginary number.
EXAMPLE
1-23 = i123  
1-1 = i11 = i
1-36 = i136 = 6i  1-18 = i118 = 3i12
i1a
1-a = i1a.
a
The principal square root of a negative number is defined in terms of i.
It is customary to write in front of a radical sign, as we did for 
to avoid confusing
with 1ai.

Introduction to Complex Numbers
Recall that

Now consider the expression 
To find 
we need to find a number such that 
However, the square of any real number 
(except zero) is a positive number. Consequently, we must expand our concept of number
to include numbers whose squares are negative numbers.
Around the seventeenth century, a new number, called an imaginary number, was
defined so that a negative number would have a square root. The letter was chosen to
represent the number whose square is -1.

Note from these examples that a real number is a complex number whose imaginary part
is zero, and an imaginary number is a complex number whose real part is zero and whose
imaginary part is not zero.

Question • What are the real part and imaginary part of 
Note from the diagram at the left that the set of real numbers is a subset of the
complex numbers and the set of imaginary numbers is a separate subset of the complex

Definition of Multiplication of Complex Numbers
If 
and 
are complex numbers, then
(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i
c + di
a + bi
Caution
Recall that the definition of the
product of radical expressions
requires that the radicand be a
positive number. Therefore, when
multiplying expressions contain-
ing negative radicands, we first
must rewrite the expression using
i and a positive radicand. 
Because every complex number can be written as a sum of two terms, it is natural to
perform multiplication on complex numbers in a manner consistent with the operation
defined on binomials and the definition 
By using this analogy, you can multiply
complex numbers without memorizing the definition.

To write this 
expression in simplest form, multiply the numerator and denominator by 
Here is another example.
Recall that to simplify the quotient 
we multiply the numerator and denomina-
tor by the conjugate of 
which is 
In a similar manner, to find the 
quotient of two complex numbers, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the con-
jugate of the denominator.
The complex numbers

in each expression with the current value of that expression
(0.1925 in this case). This is called feedback because we are feeding our output back
into each expression as input. Each new evaluation is referred to as an iteration. This
time each expression takes on the value 0.65883125. Still no surprises. Continue the

The Golden Mean
There is a common theme among the following: a stage for the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia; the giant pyramid of Cheops in
Egypt; the Parthenon in Athens, Greece; and the Mona Lisa, which hangs
in the Louvre in Paris, France. All of these are related through a number
called the golden mean, symbolized by
. The golden mean is thought
to be an aesthetically pleasing ratio—thus its popularity in art and
architecture. Exercises 82 and 83 on page 122 give a method for
calculating the golden mean.
Generally, this number manifests itself as a ratio of sides of geometric
figures. The photo above shows how the golden mean is represented in the
structure of the Cheops pyramid.

Linear and Absolute Value Equations
Linear Equations
An equation is a statement about the equality of two expressions. If either of the expres-
sions contains a variable, the equation may be a true statement for some values of the vari-
able and a false statement for other values. For example, the equation 
is a
true statement for 
but it is false for any number except 3. The number 3 is said to
satisfy the equation 
because substituting 3 for 
produces 
which is a true statement.
To solve an equation means to find all values of the variable that satisfy the equation.
The values that satisfy an equation are called solutions or roots of the equation. For
instance, 2 is a solution of 
Equivalent equations are equations that have exactly the same solution or solutions.
The process of solving an equation is often accomplished by producing a sequence of
equivalent equations until we arrive at an equation or equations of the form
Variable = Constant
To produce these equivalent equations, apply the properties of real numbers and the follow-
ing two properties of equality.
Addition and Subtraction Property of Equality
Adding the same expression to each side of an equation or subtracting the same
expression from each side of an equation produces an equivalent equation.
EXAMPLE
Begin with the equation 
. Replacing x with 9 shows that 9 is a solution
of the equation.  Now add 7 to each side of the equation. The resulting equation is
, and the solution of the new equation is still 9.
Multiplication and Division Property of Equality
Multiplying or dividing each side of an equation by the same nonzero expression
produces an equivalent equation.
EXAMPLE
Begin with the equation 
. Replacing x with 12 shows that 12 is a solution of
the equation. Now multiply each side of the equation by . The resulting equation is
, and the solution of the new equation is still 12.
Many applications can be modeled by linear equations in one variable.

LINEAR AND ABSOLUTE VALUE EQUATIONS
Definition of a Linear Equation
A linear equation, or first-degree equation, in the single variable is an equation
that can be written in the form
where 
and 
are real numbers, with 
Linear equations are solved by applying the properties of real numbers and the prop-
erties of equality.

If an equation involves fractions, it is helpful to multiply each side of the equation by
the least common denominator (LCD) of all denominators to produce an equivalent equa-
tion that does not contain fractions.

Contradictions, Conditional Equations,

An equation that has no solutions is called a contradiction. The equation 
is a
contradiction. No number is equal to itself increased by 1.
An equation that is true for some values of the variable but not true for other values
of the variable is called a conditional equation. For example, 
is a conditional
equation because it is true for 
and false for any number not equal to 6.

Movie Theater Ticket Prices
Movie theater ticket prices have been increasing steadily in recent years (see
Table 1.1). An equation that models the average U.S. movie theater ticket price ,
in dollars, is given by
where is the number of years after 2003. (This means that 
corresponds to 2003.)
Use this equation to predict the year in which the average U.S. movie theater ticket price
will reach $7.50.
Solution
• Substitute 7.50 for p.
• Solve for t.
Our equation predicts that the average U.S. movie theater ticket price will reach $7.50
about 7.1 years after 2003, which is 2010.

Applications
Linear equations emerge in a variety of application problems. In solving such problems, it
generally helps to apply specific techniques in a series of small steps. The following gen-
eral strategies should prove helpful in the remaining portion of this section.
Strategies for Solving Application Problems
1. Read the problem carefully. If necessary, reread the problem several times.
2. When appropriate, draw a sketch and label parts of the drawing with the
specific information given in the problem.
3. Determine the unknown quantities, and label them with variables. Write down
any equation that relates the variables.
4. Use the information from step 3, along with a known formula or some
additional information given in the problem, to write an equation.
5. Solve the equation obtained in step 4, and check to see whether the results
satisfy all the conditions of the original problem.

Similar triangles are ones for which the measures of corresponding angles are equal.
The triangles below are similar.
An important relationship among the sides of similar triangles is that the ratios of corre-
sponding sides are equal. Thus, for the triangles above,
This fact is used in many applications.
EXAMPLE 4
A Problem Involving Similar Triangles
A person 6 feet tall is in the shadow of a building 40 feet tall and is walking directly
away from the building. When the person is 30 feet from the building, the tip of the
person’s shadow is at the same point as the tip of the shadow of the building. How
much farther must the person walk to be just out of the shadow of the building? Round
to the nearest tenth of a foot.

Many business applications can be solved by using the equation
EXAMPLE 5
A Business Application
It costs a tennis shoe manufacturer $26.55 to produce a pair of tennis shoes that sells
for $49.95. How many pairs of tennis shoes must the manufacturer sell to make a profit
of $14,274.00?
Solution
The profit is equal to the revenue minus the cost. If equals the number of pairs of tennis
shoes to be sold, then the revenue will be $49.95x and the cost will be $26.55x. Therefore,
The manufacturer must sell 610 pairs of tennis shoes to make the desired profit.

Percent mixture problems involve combining solutions or alloys that have different con-
centrations of a common substance. Percent mixture problems can be solved by using the
formula 
where is the percent of concentration (in decimal form), is the amount
of the solution or alloy, and 
is the quantity of a substance in the solution or alloy. For
example, in 4 liters of a 25% acid solution, is the percent of acid (0.25 as a decimal), 
is
the amount of solution (4 liters), and 
is the amount of acid in the solution, which equals

A Percent Mixture Problem
A chemist mixes an 11% hydrochloric acid solution with a 6% hydrochloric acid
solution. How many milliliters of each solution should the chemist use to make a 
600-milliliter solution that is 8% hydrochloric acid?
Solution
Let be the number of milliliters of the 11% solution. Because the solution after
mixing will have a total of 600 milliliters of fluid, 
is the number of milliliters
of the 6% solution. See Figure 1.5.
Because all the hydrochloric acid in the solution after mixing comes from either the
11% solution or the 6% solution, the number of milliliters of hydrochloric acid in the
11% solution added to the number of milliliters of hydrochloric acid in the 6% solution
must equal the number of milliliters of hydrochloric acid in the 8% solution.
=
The chemist should use 240 milliliters of the 11% solution and 360 milliliters of the
6% solution to make a 600-milliliter solution that is 8% hydrochloric acid.

How long will it take to fill the pool if both pumps are used?
Solution
Because pump A fills the pool in 6 hours, 
represents the part of the pool filled by
pump A in 1 hour. Because pump B fills the pool in 3 hours, 
represents the part of
the pool filled by pump B in 1 hour.

The term quadratic is derived from
the Latin word quadrare, which
means “to make square.” Because
the area of a square that measures
x units on each side is x 2, we refer
to equations that can be written in

Solving Quadratic Equations by Completing the Square
Consider two binomial squares and their perfect-square trinomial products.
In each of the preceding perfect-square trinomials, the coefficient of 
is 1 and the constant
term is the square of half the coefficient of the term.
Adding to a binomial of the form 
the constant term that makes the binomial a
perfect-square trinomial is called completing the square. For example, to complete the
square of 
add
to produce the perfect-square trinomial 
Completing the square is a powerful procedure that can be used to solve any quadratic
equation. For instance, to solve 
first isolate the variable terms on one
side of the equation and the constant term on the other side.
• Subtract 13 from each side of the equation.
• Complete the square by adding 
to each side of the equation.
• Factor and solve by the square root procedure.
The solutions of 
are 
and 
You can check these solutions
by substituting each solution into the original equation. For instance, the following check
shows that 
does satisfy the original equation.
• Substitute 
for x.
• Simplify.
• The left side equals the right side, so 
checks.

Math Matters
Mathematicians have studied
quadratic equations for centuries.
Many of the initial quadratic equa-
tions they studied resulted from
attempts to solve geometry prob-
lems. One of the most famous,
which dates from around 500 B.C.,
concerns “squaring a circle.” The
question was, Is it possible to con-
struct a square whose area is the
same as the area of a given circle?
For these early mathematicians, to
construct meant to draw with only
a straightedge and a compass. It
was approximately 2300 years later
when mathematicians proved that
such a construction is impossible.

Math Matters
Ancient mathematicians thought
of “completing the square” in a
geometric manner. For instance,
to complete the square of 
x 2 + 8x, draw a square that
measures x units on each side and
add four rectangles that measure
1 unit by x units to the right side
of and the bottom of the square.
Each of the rectangles has an area
of x square units, so the total area
of the figure is x2 + 8x. To make
this figure a complete square, we
must add 16 squares that measure
1 unit by 1 unit, as shown below.
This figure is a complete square
whose area is

Solving Quadratic Equations by Using the Quadratic
Formula
Completing the square for 
produces a formula for in terms
of the coefficients 
and 
The formula is known as the quadratic formula, and it can
be used to solve any quadratic equation.
The Quadratic Formula
If 
then
Proof
We assume 
is a positive real number. If 
were a negative real number, then we
could multiply each side of the equation by 
to make it positive.
• Given.
• Isolate the constant term.
• Multiply each term on each side of
the equation by 
• Complete the square.
• Factor the left side. Simplify the
powers on the right side.
• Use a common denominator to
simplify the right side.
• Apply the square root procedure.
• Because 
• Add 
to each side.
As a general rule, you should first try to solve quadratic equations by factoring. If the
factoring process proves difficult, then solve by using the quadratic formula.

Applications of Quadratic Equations
A right triangle contains one 90
 angle. The side opposite the 90
 angle is called the
hypotenuse. The other two sides are called legs. The lengths of the sides of a right triangle
are related by a theorem known as the Pythagorean Theorem.
The Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse of a
right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs. This theorem is
often used to solve applications that involve right triangles.

• Substitute in the volume formula.
• Multiply each side by 2.
• Simplify the left side.
• Write in ax2 + bx + c = 0 form.
• Use the quadratic formula.
We can disregard the negative value because the width must be positive. The width of
the new candy bar, to the nearest tenth of an inch, should be 1.7 inches. The length
should be 3 inches longer, which is 4.7 inches.

Quadratic equations are often used to determine the height (position) of an object that
has been dropped or projected. For instance, the position equation
can be used to estimate the height of a projected object near the surface of Earth at a given
time in seconds. In this equation, 
is the initial velocity of the object in feet per second
and 
is the initial height of the object in feet.

Gate Bridge, which is 220 feet above the water. How long will it take for the ball to hit

Solution
The distance 
in feet, of the ball above the water after seconds is given by the posi-
tion equation s = -16t 2 - 5t + 220. We have replaced 
with

Although we could use this procedure every time we solve an equation containing a
variable with a rational exponent, we will rely on a shortcut that recognizes the need for
the absolute value symbol when the numerator of the rational exponent is an even integer.
Here is the solution of 
, using this shortcut.
• Raise each side of the equation to the 3>2 (the reciprocal of 2>3)
power.
• Because the numerator in the exponent of x2>3 is an even number,
the absolute value sign is necessary.
The solutions are 64 and 64.
Now consider

Solve a Work Problem
A small pipe takes 12 minutes longer than a larger pipe to empty a tank. Working
together, they can empty the tank in 1.75 minutes. How long would it take the smaller
pipe to empty the tank if the larger pipe is closed?
Solution
Let t be the time it takes the smaller pipe to empty the tank. Then t - 12 is the time for
the larger pipe to empty the tank. Both pipes are open for 1.75 minutes. Therefore,
is the portion of the tank emptied by the smaller pipe and 
is the portion 
of the tank emptied by the larger pipe. Working together, they empty one tank. Thus
. Solve this equation for t.
• Write the quadratic equation in
standard form.
Using the quadratic formula, the solutions of the above equation are 
and
. Substituting 
into the time for the larger pipe would give a negative
time (
), so that answer is not possible. The time for the smaller pipe
to empty the tank with the larger pipe closed is 14 minutes.

Solve an Application Involving Radicals
A cabin is located in a meadow at the end of a straight driveway 2 kilometers long. A
post office is 5 kilometers from the driveway along a straight road. (See the diagram
below.) A woman walks 2 kilometers per hour through the meadow to point P and then
5 kilometers per hour along the road to the post office. If it takes the woman 2.25 hours
to reach the post office, what is the distance x of point P from the end of the driveway?
Round to the nearest tenth of a kilometer.
Solution
Recall that 
. Therefore, 
. Using this equation,
we have
The sum of these two times equals the total time (2.25 hours). Thus
Solve the equation.

Properties of Inequalities
In Section P.1 we used inequalities to describe the order of real numbers and to represent sub-
sets of real numbers. In this section we consider inequalities that involve a variable. In partic-
ular, we consider how to determine which real numbers make an inequality a true statement.
The solution set of an inequality is the set of all real numbers for which the inequal-
ity is a true statement. For instance, the solution set of 
is the set of all real num-
bers greater than 3. Two inequalities are equivalent inequalities if they have the same
solution set. We can solve many inequalities by producing simpler but equivalent inequal-
ities until the solutions are readily apparent. To produce these simpler but equivalent
inequalities, we often apply the following properties.
Properties of Inequalities
Let 
and be real numbers.
1. Addition–Subtraction Property
If the same real number is added to or
subtracted from each side of an inequality, the resulting inequality is
equivalent to the original inequality.
and 
are equivalent inequalities.
2. Multiplication–Division Property
a.
Multiplying or dividing each side of an inequality by the same positive
real number produces an equivalent inequality.
If 
then 
and 
are equivalent inequalities.
b.
Multiplying or dividing each side of an inequality by the same negative
real number produces an equivalent inequality provided the direction of
the inequality symbol is reversed.

Math Matters
Another property of inequalities,
called the transitive property, states
that for real numbers a, b, and c, if
a 7 b and b 7 c, then a 7 c. We
say that the relationship “is greater
than” is a transitive relationship.
Not all relationships are transitive
relationships. For instance, con-
sider the game of scissors, paper,
rock. In this game, scissors beats
paper and paper beats rock, but
scissors does not beat rock!

EXAMPLE
Property 1
Adding or subtracting the same number to (from) each side of an
inequality produces an equivalent inequality.
Property 2a
Multiplying or dividing each side of an inequality by the same
positive number produces an equivalent inequality.
Property 2b
Multiplying or dividing each side of an inequality by the same
negative number produces an equivalent inequality provided the
direction of the inequality symbol is reversed.
Note the difference between Property 2a and Property 2b. Property 2a states that an
equivalent inequality is produced when each side of a given inequality is multiplied (divided)
by the same positive real number and the inequality symbol is not changed. By contrast,
Property 2b states that when each side of a given inequality is multiplied (divided) by a neg-
ative real number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality symbol to produce an
equivalent inequality. For instance, multiplying both sides of 
by 
produces the
equivalent inequality 
(We multiplied both sides of the first inequality by 
and
we changed the “less than” symbol to a “greater than” symbol.)

Polynomial Inequalities

because
and
Sign Property of Polynomials
Polynomials in have the following property: for all values of between two
consecutive real zeros, all values of the polynomial are positive or all values of the
polynomial are negative.
In our work with inequalities that involve polynomials, the real zeros of the polyno-
mial are also referred to as critical values of the inequality. On a number line, the criti-
cal values of an inequality separate the real numbers that make the inequality true from
those that make it false.
For instance, to solve the inequality 
, we begin by solving the equa-
tion x2 + 3x - 4 = 0 to find the real zeros of the polynomial.
x = -4  
x = 1
x + 4 = 0   or x - 1 = 0

The real zeros are -4 and 1. They are the critical values of the inequality x2 + 3x - 4 6 0,
and they separate the real number line into three intervals, as shown in Figure 1.10.
To determine the intervals in which 
is less than 0, pick a number called
a test value from each of the three intervals and then determine whether 
is
less than 0 for each of these test values. For example, in the interval 
pick a test

Rational Inequalities
A rational expression is the quotient of two polynomials. Rational inequalities involve
rational expressions, and they can be solved by an extension of the critical value method.
Definition of a Critical Value of a Rational Expression
A critical value of a rational expression is a number that causes the numerator of
the rational expression to equal zero or the denominator of the rational expression
to equal zero.
Rational expressions also have the property that they remain either positive for all val-
ues of the variable between consecutive critical values or negative for all values of the vari-
able between consecutive critical values.
Following is a summary of the steps used to solve rational inequalities by the critical
value method.
Solving a Rational Inequality Using the Critical Value Method
1. Write the inequality so that one side of the inequality is a rational expression
and the other side is zero.
2. Find the real zeros of the numerator of the rational expression and the real
zeros of its denominator. They are the critical values of the inequality.
3. Use test values to determine which of the consecutive intervals formed by the
critical values are to be included in the solution set.

In many business applications, companies are interested in the cost 
of manufactur-
ing items, the revenue 
generated by selling all the items, and the profit 
made by sell-
ing the items.
In the next example, the cost, in dollars, of manufacturing tennis racquets is given by
C =
. The 120,000 represents the fixed cost because it remains constant
regardless of how many racquets are manufactured. The 
represents the variable cost
because this term varies depending on how many racquets are manufactured. Each addi-
tional racquet costs the company an additional $32.
The revenue, in dollars, received from the sale of 
tennis racquets is given by
The quantity 
is the price the company charges for
each tennis racquet. The price varies depending on the number of racquets that are manu-
factured. For instance, if the number of racquets that the company manufactures is small,
the company will be able to demand almost $200 for each racquet. As the number of rac-
quets that the company manufactures increases (approaches 20,000), the company will
only be able to sell all the racquets if it decreases the price of each racquet.

Mean Weight of Women If a researcher wanted to
know the mean weight (the mean is the sum of all the
measurements divided by the number of measurements) of
women in the United States, the weight of every woman would
have to be measured and then the mean weight calculated—an
impossible task. Instead, researchers find a representative
sample of women and find the mean weight of the sample.
Because the entire population of women is not used, there is
a possibility that the calculated mean weight is not the true
mean weight. For one study, researchers used the formula 
where m is the true mean weight, in pounds,
of all women, to be 98% sure of the range of values for the true
mean weight. Using this inequality, what is the range of mean
weights of women in the United States? Round to the nearest

Direct Variation
Many real-life situations involve variables that are related by a type of equation called a
variation. For example, a stone thrown into a pond generates circular ripples whose cir-
cumferences and diameters increase in size. The equation 
expresses the relation-
ship between the circumference 
of a circle and its diameter 
If 
increases, then 
increases. The circumference 
is said to vary directly as the diameter d.

Direct variation occurs in many daily applications. For example, suppose the cost of a
newspaper is 50 cents. The cost 
to purchase newspapers is directly proportional to the

That is, 
In this example the variation constant is 50.
To solve a problem that involves a variation, we typically write a general equation that
relates the variables and then use given information to solve for the variation constant.
EXAMPLE 1
Solve a Direct Variation
The distance sound travels varies directly as the time it travels. If sound travels
1340 meters in 4 seconds, find the distance sound will travel in 5 seconds.
Solution
Write an equation that relates the distance 
to the time 
Because 
varies directly as 
our equation is 
Because

Therefore, the specific equation that relates the 
meters sound travels in seconds is

the left in Figure 1.19 shows that the volume of a gas at normal atmospheric pressure is
60 milliliters. If the pressure is doubled by adding mercury (Hg), as shown in the mid-

the volume of the gas to 20 milliliters, as shown in the tube at the right in Figure 1.19.

Boyle’s Law states that the volume

varies inversely as the pressure 
The volume of a gas in a J-shaped tube is 75 milliliters
when the pressure is 1.5 atmospheres. Find the volume of the gas when the pressure is
increased to 2.5 atmospheres.
Solution
The volume 
varies inversely as the pressure 
so 
The volume 
is
75 milliliters when the pressure is 1.5 atmospheres, so

the tension is the same for both strings.
31. Jet Engine Noise The sound intensity of a jet engine, meas-
ured in watts per meter squared 
, is inversely propor-
tional to the square of the distance between the engine and an
airport ramp worker. For a certain jet, the sound intensity meas-
ures 
at a distance of 7 meters from the ramp worker.
What is the sound intensity for a ramp worker 10 meters from
the jet?
32. Illumination The illumination a source of light provides is
inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the
source. If the illumination at a distance of 10 feet from the
source is 50 footcandles, what is the illumination at a distance
of 15 feet from the source? Round to the nearest tenth of a

Earned Run Average A pitcher’s earned run average
(ERA) is directly proportional to the number of earned
runs the pitcher has allowed and is inversely proportional to the
number of innings the pitcher has pitched. During the 2002
season, Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks had an
ERA of 2.32. He allowed 67 earned runs in 260 innings.
During the same season, Tom Glavine of the Atlanta Braves
allowed 74 earned runs in 224.2 innings. What was Glavine’s
ERA for the 2002 season? Round to the nearest hundredth.

material.
39. Force, Speed, and Radius Relationships The force needed
to keep a car from skidding on a curve varies jointly as the
weight of the car and the square of its speed and inversely as
the radius of the curve. It takes 2800 pounds of force to keep
an 1800-pound car from skidding on a curve with a radius of
425 feet at 45 mph. What force is needed to keep the same car
from skidding when it takes a similar curve with a radius of
450 feet at 55 mph? Round to the nearest 10 pounds.

Mean Height If a researcher wanted to know the mean
height (the mean is the sum of all the measurements
divided by the number of measurements) of women in the
United States, the height of every woman would have to be
measured and then the mean height calculated—an impossible
task. Instead, researchers find a representative sample of
women and find the mean height of the sample. Because the
entire population of women is not used, there is a possibility
that the calculated mean height is not the true mean height. For 
one study, researchers used the formula 
,
where m is the true meanheight, in inches, of all women, to be
90% sure of the range of values for the true mean height. Using

CHAPTER 2
NASA/Johnson Space Center
Functions as Models
To prepare astronauts for the experience of zero gravity (technically,
microgravity) in space, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) uses a specially designed jet. A pilot accelerates the jet upward to
an altitude of approximately 9000 meters and then reduces power. At that
time, the plane continues upward, noses over, and begins to descend until
the pilot increases power. The maneuver is then repeated. The figure to the
left shows one maneuver.
During the climb and the point at which the pilot increases power, the
force on the astronauts is approximately twice what they experience on
Earth. During the time of reduced power (about 15 to 20 seconds), the
plane is in free fall and the astronauts experience microgravity. The sudden
changes in gravity effects have a tendency to make astronauts sick.
Because of this, the plane has been dubbed the Vomit Comet.
A parabola, one of the topics of this chapter, can approximate the height of
the jet. Using an equation of the parabola, the time during which the
astronauts experience microgravity in one maneuver can be determined.
See Exercise 47, page 210.
Astronauts experiencing microgravity. A typical training session may
consist of 40 to 60 microgravity maneuvers, each lasting about 18
seconds. The zero gravity scenes in the movie Apollo 13 were produced
using these microgravity maneuvers.

Two-Dimensional Coordinate 
System and Graphs
Cartesian Coordinate Systems
Each point on a coordinate axis is associated with a number called its coordinate. Each
point on a flat, two-dimensional surface, called a coordinate plane or xy-plane, is associ-
ated with an ordered pair of numbers called coordinates of the point. Ordered pairs are
denoted by 
where the real number 
is the x-coordinate or abscissa and the real
number 
is the y-coordinate or ordinate.
The coordinates of a point are determined by the point’s position relative to a horizon-
tal coordinate axis called the x-axis and a vertical coordinate axis called the y-axis. The
axes intersect at the point 
called the origin. In Figure 2.1, the axes are labeled such
that positive numbers appear to the right of the origin on the x-axis and above the origin
on the y-axis. The four regions formed by the axes are called quadrants and are numbered
counterclockwise. This two-dimensional coordinate system is referred to as a Cartesian
coordinate system in honor of René Descartes.
Figure 2.1
Figure 2.2
To plot a point
means to draw a dot at its location in the coordinate plane. In
Figure 2.2, we have plotted the points 
and
The order in which the coordinates of an ordered pair are listed is important.
Figure 2.2 shows that 
and 
do not denote the same point.
Data often are displayed in visual form as a set of points called a scatter dia-
gram or scatter plot. For instance, the scatter diagram in Figure 2.3 shows the
current and projected revenue of Web-filtering software vendors. (Web-filtering
software allows businesses to control which Internet sites are available to employees
while at work.) The point whose coordinates are approximately (2005, 520) means that
in 2005 approximately $520 million in revenue were generated by companies that sup-
plied this software. The line segments that connect the points in Figure 2.3 help illus-
trate trends.

Math Matters
The concepts of analytic geometry
developed over an extended
period, culminating in 1637 with
the publication of two works:
Discourse on the Method for Rightly
Directing One’s Reason and
Searching for Truth in the Sciences
by René Descartes (1596–1650)
and Introduction to Plane and Solid
Loci by Pierre de Fermat. Each of
these works was an attempt to
integrate the study of geometry
with the study of algebra. Of the
two mathematicians, Descartes is
usually given most of the credit
for developing analytic geometry.
In fact, Descartes became so
famous in La Haye, the city in
which he was born, that it was
renamed La Haye-Descartes.

Abscissa comes from the same
root word as scissors. An open
pair of scissors looks like an x.

earlier to denote an interval on a
one-dimensional number line.
In this section, (a, b) denotes an
ordered pair in a two-dimensional
plane. This should not cause con-
fusion in future sections because
as each mathematical topic is
introduced, it will be clear
whether a one-dimensional or a
two-dimensional coordinate
system is involved.
Answer • More. The revenue in 2003 was approximately $350 million. The projected revenue in
2009 is approximately $925 million, which is more than twice $350 million.

Distance and Midpoint Formulas
The Cartesian coordinate system makes it possible to combine the concepts of algebra and
geometry into a branch of mathematics called analytic geometry.
The distance between two points on a horizontal line is the absolute value of the dif-
ference between the x-coordinates of the two points. The distance between two points on a
vertical line is the absolute value of the difference between the y-coordinates of the two
points. For example, as shown in Figure 2.4, the distance 
between the points with coor-
dinates 
and 
is 
If two points are not on a horizontal or vertical line, then a distance formula for the
distance between the two points can be developed as follows.
The distance between the points 
and 
in Figure 2.5 is the length of
the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose sides are horizontal and vertical line segments that
measure 
and 
respectively. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to this
triangle produces

nonnegative, the negative root is not listed.

Thus we have established the following theorem.
ƒ y2 - y1ƒ2 = (y2 - y1)2
ƒ x2 - x1ƒ2 = (x2 - x1)2
= 2(x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2

Integrating Technology
Some graphing calculators, such as the TI-83/TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus, have a TABLE
feature that allows you to create a table similar to the one shown in Example 2.
Enter the equation to be graphed, the first value for 
and the increment (the differ-
ence between successive values of ). For instance, entering 
an initial
value of of 
and an increment of 1 yields a display similar to the one in
Figure 2.11. Changing the initial value to 
and the increment to 2 gives the table
in Figure 2.12.
With some calculators, you can scroll through the table by using the up- or down-
arrow keys. In this way, you can determine many more ordered pairs of the graph.

Maria Agnesi (1718–1799) wrote
Foundations of Analysis for the Use
of Italian Youth, one of the most
successful textbooks of the eigh-
teenth century. The French
Academy authorized a translation
into French in 1749, noting that
“there is no other book, in any
language, which would enable a
reader to penetrate as deeply, or
as rapidly, into the fundamental
concepts of analysis.” A curve that
Agnesi discusses in her text is
given by the equation
Unfortunately, due to a translation
error from Italian to English, the
curve became known as the
“witch of Agnesi.”

Integrating Technology
A graphing calculator or computer graphing software can be used to draw the graphs
in Examples 3 and 4. These graphing utilities graph a curve in much the same way as
you would, by selecting values of and calculating the corresponding values of 
A curve is then drawn through the points.
If you use a graphing utility to graph 
you will need to use the
absolute value function that is built into the utility. The equation you enter will look
similar to Y1=abs(X–2).
To graph the equation in Example 4, you will enter two equations. The equations
you enter will be similar to

Intercepts
On a graph, any point that has an x- or a y-coordinate of zero is called an intercept of the
graph, because it is at this point that the graph intersects the x- or the y-axis.
Definitions of x-Intercepts and y-Intercepts
If 
satisfies an equation in two variables, then the point whose coordinates
are 
is called an x-intercept of the graph of the equation.
If 
satisfies an equation in two variables, then the point whose coordinates
are 
is called a y-intercept of the graph of the equation.
To find the x-intercepts of the graph of an equation, let

TWO-DIMENSIONAL COORDINATE SYSTEM AND GRAPHS
Circles, Their Equations, and Their Graphs
Frequently you will sketch graphs by plotting points. However, some graphs can be
sketched merely by recognizing the form of the equation. A circle is an example of a curve
whose graph you can sketch after you have inspected its equation.
Definition of a Circle
A circle is the set of points in a plane that are a fixed distance from a specified
point. The fixed distance is the radius of the circle, and the specified point is the
center of the circle.
Integrating Technology
In Example 5, it was possible to find the x-intercepts by solving a quadratic equation.
In some instances, however, solving an equation to find the intercepts may be very dif-
ficult. In these cases, a graphing calculator can be used to estimate the x-intercepts.
The x-intercepts of the graph of 
can be estimated using the ZERO
feature of a TI-83/TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus calculator. The keystrokes and some sample

The standard form of the equation of a circle is derived by using the definition of a
circle. To derive the standard form, we use the distance formula. Figure 2.16 is a circle with
center 
and radius 
The point 
is on the circle if and only if it is a distance of 
units from the center 
Thus 
is on the circle if and only if

See the graph of the circle in Figure 2.17. Because the point

Relations
In many situations in science, business, and mathematics, a correspondence exists between
two sets. The correspondence is often defined by a table, an equation, or a graph, each of
which can be viewed from a mathematical perspective as a set of ordered pairs. In mathe-
matics, any set of ordered pairs is called a relation.
Table 2.1 defines a correspondence between a set of percent scores and a set of letter
grades. For each score from 0 to 100, there corresponds only one letter grade. The score
94% corresponds to the letter grade of A. Using ordered-pair notation, we record this cor-
respondence as 
The equation 
indicates that the distance 
that a rock falls (neglecting air
resistance) corresponds to the time that it has been falling. For each nonnegative value 
the equation assigns only one value for the distance 
According to this equation, in 3 sec-
onds a rock will fall 144 feet, which we record as

The graph in Figure 2.19, on page 167, defines a correspondence between the length
of a pendulum and the time it takes the pendulum to complete one oscillation. For each non-
negative pendulum length, the graph yields only one time. According to the graph, a pen-
dulum length of 2 feet yields an oscillation time of 1.6 seconds and a pendulum length of 4
feet yields an oscillation time of 2.2 seconds, where the time is measured to the nearest tenth
of a second. These results can be recorded as the ordered pairs 
and

Definition of a Function
A function is a set of ordered pairs in which no two ordered pairs have the same
first coordinate and different second coordinates.
Although every function is a relation, not every relation is a function. For instance,
consider 
from the grading correspondence. The first coordinate, 94, is paired with
a second coordinate, A. It would not make sense to have 94 paired with A, 
and
94 paired with B, 
The same first coordinate would be paired with two different
second coordinates. This would mean that two students with the same score received dif-
ferent grades, one student an A and the other a B!
Functions may have ordered pairs with the same second coordinate. For instance,
and 
are both ordered pairs that belong to the function defined by Table 2.1.
Thus a function may have different first coordinates and the same second coordinate.
The equation 
represents a function because for each value of there is only one
value of 
However, not every equation represents a function. For instance, 
does not represent a function. The ordered pairs 
and 
are both solutions of
the equation. However, these ordered pairs do not satisfy the definition of a function: There
are two ordered pairs with the same first coordinate but different second coordinates.
Question • Does the set 
define a function?
The domain of a function is the set of all the first coordinates of the ordered pairs.
The range of a function is the set of all the second coordinates. In the function determined
by the grading correspondence in Table 2.1, the domain is the interval 
The range
is
In a function, each domain element is paired with one and only one
range element.
If a function is defined by an equation, the variable that represents elements of the
domain is the independent variable. The variable that represents elements of the range is
the dependent variable. For the situation involving the free fall of a rock, we used the
equation 
The elements of the domain represented the time the rock fell, and the

Math Matters
Historians generally agree that
Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) was
the first person to use the word
function. His definition of function
occurs in his book Introduction to
Analysis of the Infinite, published
in 1748. Euler contributed to
many areas of mathematics and
was one of the most prolific
expositors of mathematics.
Answer • Yes. There are no two ordered pairs with the same first coordinate but different second
coordinates.

Functions can be named by using a letter or a combination of letters, such as 
log,
or tan. If is an element of the domain of 
then 
which is read “f of x” or “the value
of f at x,” is the element in the range of f that corresponds to the domain element x. The
notation “f ” and the notation “

whereas “

Solution
For each part, we create a table of ordered pairs for the function, plot the ordered pairs
and then draw a graph through them. Although each of the functions has a similar look,
their graphs are quite different. In some cases, it takes a bit of effort to produce, by just
plotting points, an accurate graph of a function.

In a
manner similar to applying the vertical line test, we can apply a horizontal line test to iden-
tify one-to-one functions.
Horizontal Line Test for a One-To-One Function
If every horizontal line intersects the graph of a function at most once, then the
graph is the graph of a one-to-one function.
For example, some horizontal lines intersect the graph in Figure 2.29 at more than one
point. This is not the graph of a one-to-one function. Every horizontal line intersects the
graph in Figure 2.30 at most once. This is the graph of a one-to-one function.
Greatest Integer Function (Floor Function)
The graphs of some functions do not have any breaks or gaps. These functions, whose
graphs can be drawn without lifting a pencil off the paper, are called continuous functions.
The graphs of other functions do have breaks or discontinuities. One such function is the
greatest integer function or floor function. This function is denoted by symbols such as

To graph the floor function, first observe that the value of the floor function is constant
between any two consecutive integers. For instance, between the integers 1 and 2, we have
Between

Using this property of the floor function, we can create a table of values and then
graph the floor function. See Figure 2.31.

The graph of the floor function has discontinuities (breaks) whenever is an integer. The
domain of the floor function is the set of real numbers; the range is the set of integers.
Because the graph appears to be a series of steps, sometimes the floor function is referred
to as a step function.

Many graphing calculators use the notation 
for the floor function. The screens
shown on page 177 are from a TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus graphing calculator. The graph
in Figure 2.32 was drawn in “connected” mode. This graph does not show the discon-
tinuities that occur whenever is an integer.
The graph in Figure 2.33 was constructed by graphing the floor function in “dot”
mode. In this case, the discontinuities at the integers are apparent.

INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONS
One application of the floor function is rounding numbers. For instance, suppose a
credit card company charges 1.5% interest on an unpaid monthly balance of $237.84. Then
the interest charge is
Thus the interest charge is $3.57. Note that the result was rounded to the nearest cent, or
hundredth. The computer program that determines the interest charge uses the floor func-
tion to calculate the rounding. To round a number 
to the nearest th decimal place, we
use the following formula.
Here is the calculation for the interest owed. In this case, 
and 
(round to the second decimal place).
Example 9 gives another application of the floor function.

Integrating Technology
The function graphed in Example 9 is an example of a function for which a graphing
calculator may not produce a graph that is a good representation of the function. You
may be required to make adjustments in the MODE, SET UP, or WINDOW of the
graphing calculator so that it will produce a better representation of the function. A
graph may also require some fine tuning, such as open or solid circles at particular
points, to accurately represent the function.

Slopes of Lines
A function that can be written in the form 
is called a linear function because
its graph is a straight line. Consider the graph of a straight line in Figure 2.37. Observe that
for each 1 unit increase in x, y increases by a constant amount of m units. In Figure 2.38,
note that for each 1 unit increase in x, y decreases by a constant amount of m units.
Figure 2.37
Figure 2.38
Graphs of linear functions are characterizied by having a constant rise or fall. This rise or
fall is called slope. The graph in Figure 2.37 has a positive slope; the y-value is increasing
as x increases. The graph in Figure 2.38 has a negative slope; the y-value is decreasing as
x increases.
The slope of a line can be calculated by finding the ratio of the change in y between two
points to the change in x between the same two points. For instance, consider the graph of a
straight line passing through the points 
and 
shown in Figure 2.39. The
slope of the line between the two points is

Definition of the Slope of a Nonvertical Line

of the line passing through the points

EXAMPLE
The slope of the line through

When computing the slope of a line, it does not matter which point we label 
and which
we label 
; the value of the slope will be the same. For instance, if we interchange the two
points in the previous example so that we have 
and 
, then
Frequently, the Greek letter delta ( ) is used to designate the change in a variable. Using
this notation, 
and

notation, the formula for slope
is written 
EXAMPLE 1

a.
b.
Solution
a.
The slope of the line passing through 
and 
is
Because 
the line slants upward from left to right. The slope of the line is
positive. See the graph at the left.
b.
The slope of the line passing through 
and 
is
Because 
the line slants downward from left to right. The slope of the line
is negative. See the graph at the left.

The definition of slope does not apply to vertical lines. Consider, for example, the
points

Because division by zero is undefined, we say that the slope of any vertical line is unde-
fined.
The line through 
and 
in Figure 2.41 is a horizontal line. Its slope is
given by
The slope of every horizontal line is 0.
The results for vertical and horizontal lines are summarized below.

fined. See Figure 2.42.
The graph of

See Figure 2.42.

If a function is written in the form 
then its graph can be drawn by
first plotting the y-intercept

to determine another point
on the line.

Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
Two nonintersecting lines in a plane are parallel. All vertical lines are parallel to one
another. All horizontal lines are parallel to one another.
Two lines are perpendicular if and only if they intersect and form adjacent angles,
each of which measures 90. In a plane, vertical and horizontal lines are perpendicular to
one another.

Definition of Symmetry with Respect to a Line
A graph is symmetric with respect to a line
if for each point

there is a point 
on the graph such that the line 
is the perpendicular bisector of
the line segment 
In Figure 2.52, the parabola is symmetric with

The line

of symmetry. The points

symmetry.
If

The graph of 
is a parabola with vertex at the origin, and
the y-axis is its axis of symmetry. The graph of

Maximum and Minimum of a Quadratic Function
Note from Example 2 that the graph of the parabola opens up and the vertex is the lowest
point on the graph of the parabola. Therefore, the y-coordinate of the vertex is the mini-
mum value of that function. This information can be used to determine the range of
The range is 
Similarly, if the graph of a parabola
opened down, the vertex would be the highest point on the graph and the y-coordinate of
the vertex would be the maximum value of the function. For instance, the maximum value
of

range of the function is

Find the Maximum of a Quadratic Function
A long sheet of tin 20 inches wide is to be made into a trough by bending up two sides
until they are perpendicular to the bottom. How many inches should be turned up so
that the trough will achieve its maximum carrying capacity?
Solution
The trough is shown in Figure 2.59. If is the number of inches to be turned up on each
side, then the width of the base is 
inches. The maximum carrying capacity of
the trough will occur when the cross-sectional area is a maximum. The cross-sectional
area

• Area = (length)(width)
To find the point at which

where represents the number of tickets sold. Determine the maximum profit and the
cost per ticket that yields the maximum profit.
Solution
The profit from selling tickets is 
where

graph of 
To determine the points on the graph of 
multiply the y-
coordinate of each point on the graph of

Difference Quotient
The expression
is called the difference quotient of f. It enables us to study the manner in which a func-
tion changes in value as the independent variable changes.

Solution
• Apply the difference quotient.

The difference quotient 
of

For instance, let

The difference quotient
can be used to compute average velocities. In such cases, it is traditional to replace f with
s (for distance), the variable x with the variable a (for the time at the start of an observed
interval), and the variable h with 
(read as “delta t”), where 
is the difference between
the time at the end of an interval and the time at the start of the interval. For example, if
an experiment is observed over the time interval from 
seconds to

method of combining functions uses the output of one function as the input for a second
function.

cle, with the tanker at its center. The radius r (in feet) of the spill t hours after the leak
began is given by 
The area of the spill is the area of a circle and is given by
the formula 
To find the area of the spill 4 hours after the leak began, we first

The area of the spill after 4 hours is approximately 283,000 square feet.
There is an alternative way to solve this problem. Because the area of the spill depends
on the radius and the radius depends on the time, there is a relationship between area and
time. We can determine this relationship by evaluating the formula for the area of a circle
using 
This will give the area of the spill as a function of time.

You may be inclined to think that if the area of a rectangle is decreasing then its
perimeter is also decreasing, but this is not always the case. For example, the area of the
scaled rectangle in Example 7 was shown to decrease on

was always increasing.

To find the line that “best” approximates the data, regression analysis is used. This
type of analysis produces the linear function whose graph is called the line of best fit or
the least-squares regression line.1
Definition of the Least-Squares Regression Line
The least-squares regression line is the line that minimizes the sum of the squares
of the vertical deviations of all data points from the line.
To help understand this definition, consider the data set
as shown in Figure 2.109 on page 239. As we will show later, the least-squares regression
line for this data set is 
also shown in Figure 2.109. If we evaluate this lin-
ear function at the x-coordinates of the data set S, we obtain the set of ordered pairs
The vertical deviations are the differences
between the y-coordinates in S and the y-coordinates in T. From the definition, we must
calculate the sum of the squares of these deviations.

Although there is no one line that passes through every point, we could find an
approximate linear model for these data. For instance, the line shown in Figure 2.107 in
blue approximates the data better than the line shown in red. However, as Figure 2.108
shows, there are many other lines we could draw that seem to approximate the data.

EXAMPLE 1
Find a Regression Equation
Find the regression equation for the data on the population of a state and the
number of professional sports teams in that state. How many sports teams are
predicted for Indiana, whose population is approximately 6.4 million? Round to the
nearest whole number.
Solution
Using your calculator, enter the data from the table.
Then have the calculator produce the values for the
regression equation. Your results should be similar to
those shown in Figure 2.111. The equation of the
regression line is
To find the number of professional sports teams the
regression equation predicts for Indiana, evaluate the regression equation for 
.
The equation predicts that Indiana should have four sports teams.
Try Exercise 18, page 245
Correlation Coefficient
The scatter diagram of a state’s population and the
corresponding number of professional sports
teams is shown in Figure 2.112, along with the graph
of the regression line. Note that the slope of the regres-
sion line is positive. This indicates that as a state’s pop-
ulation increases the number of teams increases. Note
also that for these data the value of r on the regression
calculation screen was positive, 
.
Now consider the data in the table on the next page,
which shows the trade-in value of a 2006 Corvette for
various odometer readings. The graph in Figure 2.113 shows the scatter diagram and the
regression line.

A researcher calculates a regression line to determine the relationship between two
variables. The researcher wants to know whether a change in one variable produces a pre-
dictable change in the second variable. The value of 
tells the researcher the extent of that
relationship.
Coefficient of Determination
The coefficient of determination r2 measures the proportion of the variation in
the dependent variable that is explained by the regression equation.
For the population and sports team data, 
This means that approximately 85%
of the total variation in the dependent variable (number of teams) can be attributed to the
state population. This also means that population alone does not predict with certainty the
number of sports teams. Other factors, such as climate, are involved in the number of
sports teams.
Question • What is the coefficient of determination for the odometer reading and trade-in value
data (see page 241), and what is its significance?
Quadratic Regression Models
To this point our focus has been on linear regression equations. However, there may be a
nonlinear relationship between two quantities. The scatter diagram to the left suggests that
a quadratic function might be a better model of the data than a linear model. As we pro-
ceed through this text, various function models will be discussed.
EXAMPLE 2
Find a Quadratic Regression Model
The data in the table below were collected on five successive Saturdays. They show the
average number of cars entering a shopping center parking lot. The value of t is the num-
ber of minutes after 9:00 A.M. The value of N is the number of cars that entered the park-
ing lot in the 10 minutes prior to the value of t. Find a regression model for this data.

MODELING DATA USING REGRESSION
Solution
1. Construct a scatter diagram for these data. Enter the data into your calculator
as explained on page 239.
From the scatter diagram, it appears that there is a nonlinear relationship 
among the variables.
2. Find the regression equation. Try a quadratic regression model. For a 
TI-83/TI-83 Plus/T1-84 Plus calculator, press 
5 
.
3. Examine the coefficient of determination. The coefficient of determination is
approximately 0.984. Because this number is fairly close to 1, the regression
equation
provides a good model
of the data. The following calculator screen shows the scatter diagram and the
parabola that is the graph of the regression equation.
Try Exercise 32, page 247
In Example 2, we could have calculated the linear regression model for the data. The
results are shown at the left. Note that the coefficient of determination for this calculation
is approximately 0.419. Because this number is less than the coefficient of determination
for the quadratic model, we choose a quadratic model of the data rather than a linear model.
A final note: The regression line equation does not prove that the changes in the
dependent variable are caused by the independent variable. For instance, suppose various
cities throughout the United States were randomly selected and the numbers of gas stations
(independent variable) and restaurants (dependent variable) were recorded in a table. If we
calculated the regression equation for these data, we would find that r would be close to 1.

However, this does not mean that gas stations cause restaurants to be built. The primary
cause is that there are fewer gas stations and restaurants in cities with small populations
and greater numbers of gas stations and restaurants in cities with large populations.

Exploring Concepts with Technology
Graphing Piecewise Functions with a Graphing Calculator
A graphing calculator can be used to graph a piecewise function by including as part of
the function the interval on which each piece of the function is defined. The method is
based on the fact that a graphing calculator “evaluates” inequalities. For purposes of
this exploration, we will use keystrokes for a TI-83/TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus calculator.
For instance, store 3 in X by pressing 3 
. Now enter 
the inequality 
by pressing 
TEST3 4 
. Your screen
should look like the one at the left. Note that the value of the inequality is 0. This occurs
because the calculator replaces X with 3 and then determines whether the inequality
is true or false. The calculator expresses that the inequality is false by placing a
zero on the screen. If we repeat the sequence of steps above, except that we store 5 in
X instead of 3, the calculator will determine that the inequality is true and place a 1 on
the screen.
This property of calculators is used to graph piecewise functions. Graphs of these
functions work best when Dot mode rather than Connected mode is used. To switch to Dot
mode, select

, and then press

Astronomy In 1929, Edwin Hubble published a paper that
revolutionized astronomy (“A Relationship Between
Distance and Radial Velocity Among Extra-Galactic Nebulae,”
Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, page 168). His
paper dealt with the distance an extragalactic nebula was from
the Milky Way galaxy and the nebula’s velocity with respect to
the Milky Way. The data are given in the following table.

CHAPTER 2 TEST PREP
Now we will graph the piecewise function defined by
Enter the function2 as Y1=X*(X
-2)+X2*(X>-2) and graph it in the standard viewing
window. Note that you are multiplying each piece of the function by its domain. The
graph will appear as shown at the left.
To understand how the graph is drawn, we will consider two values of x, 
and 2,
and evaluate Y1 for each of these values.
Y1=X*(X
-2)+X2*(X>-2)
• When 
the value assigned to 
is 1; the value assigned to 
is 0.
Y1=X*(X
-2)+X2*(X>-2)
• When 
the value assigned to 
is 0; the value assigned to 
is 1.
In a similar manner, for any value 
the value assigned to (X
-2) is 1 and
the value assigned to (X>-2) is 0. Thus Y1=X*1+X2*0=X on that interval. This means that
only the 
piece of the function is graphed. When

CHAPTER 3
Applications of Polynomial Functions 
and Rational Functions
In this chapter, you will study polynomial functions and rational functions.
A polynomial function is a function defined by a polynomial. For instance,
is a polynomial function. It is a third-degree, or cubic, polynomial function
because the largest exponent of the variable x is 3. A rational function is a
function defined by the quotient of two polynomials. For instance,
is a rational function.
Polynomial and rational functions have many practical applications. In
Exercise 67, page 285, a cubic polynomial function is used to model the
power generated by a wind turbine at various wind speeds.
In Exercise 74, page 322, a rational function is used to model the amount
of medication in the bloodstream of a patient t hours after an injection.

Much of this chapter concerns finding the zeros of polynomial functions. Sometimes
the zeros of a polynomial function are determined by dividing one polynomial by another.
Division of Polynomials
To divide a polynomial by a monomial, divide each term of the polynomial by the mono-
mial. For instance,

To divide a polynomial by a binomial, we use a method similar to that used to divide nat-
ural numbers. For instance, consider

The division process ends when the expression in the bottom row is of lesser degree than
the divisor. The expression in the bottom row is the remainder, and the polynomial in the
top row is the quotient. Thus

Although there is nothing wrong with writing the answer as we did above, it is more
common to write the answer as the quotient plus the remainder divided by the divisor. (See
the note at the left.) Using this method, we write

Let P(x) and

Before dividing polynomials, make sure that each polynomial is written in descend-
ing order. In some cases, it is helpful to insert a 0 in the dividend for a missing term (one
whose coefficient is 0) so that like terms align in the same column. This is demonstrated
in Example 1.

Synthetic Division
A procedure called synthetic division can expedite the division process. To apply the syn-
thetic division procedure, the divisor must be a polynomial of the form 
where c is
a constant. In the synthetic division procedure, the variables that occur in the polynomials
are not listed. To understand how synthetic division is performed, examine the following
long division on the left and the related synthetic division on the right.

In the long division, the dividend is

Because the divisor is of the form 
with 
the division can be performed by the
synthetic division procedure. Observe that in the above synthetic division:
1. The constant c is listed as the first number in the first row, followed by the
coefficients of the dividend.
2. The first number in the third row is the leading coefficient of the dividend.
3. Each number in the second row is determined by computing the product of c and the
number in the third row of the preceding column.
4. Each of the numbers in the third row, other than the first number, is determined by
adding the numbers directly above it.

Using the Remainder Theorem to evaluate a polynomial function is often faster
than evaluating the polynomial function by direct substitution. For instance, evaluating
by substituting 7 for x requires the following
work.
= 2520
= 16,807 - 24,010 + 12,005 - 2450 + 168
= 16,807 - 10(2401) + 35(343) - 50(49) + 24(7)
P(7) = (7)5 - 10(7)4 + 35(7)3 - 50(7)2 + 24(7)
P(x) = x5 - 10x4 + 35x3 - 50x2 + 24x

Question • Is 
a zero of the function P as given in Example 4?
Here is a summary of the important role played by the remainder in the division of a
polynomial by 
Remainder of a Polynomial Division
In the division of the polynomial 
by 
the remainder is
equal to 
0 if and only if 
is a factor of 
0 if and only if c is a zero of P.
If c is a real number, then the remainder of 
is 0 if and only if 
is an x-intercept of the graph of P.
Reduced Polynomials
In Example 4 we showed that 
is a factor of 
and that the quotient of P(x) divided by 
is 
Thus
The quotient 
is called a reduced polynomial, or a depressed polyno-
mial, of

In this section, we will focus on polynomial functions of degree 3 or higher. These functions
can be graphed by the technique of plotting points; however, some additional knowledge
about polynomial functions will make graphing easier.
All polynomial functions have graphs that are smooth continuous curves. The terms
smooth and continuous are defined rigorously in calculus, but for the present, a smooth
curve is a curve that does not have sharp corners, like the graph shown in Figure 3.5a. A
continuous curve does not have a break or hole, like the graph shown in Figure 3.5b.

Far-Left and Far-Right Behavior
The graph of a polynomial function may have several up and down fluctuations; however, the
graph of every polynomial function eventually will increase or decrease without bound as
becomes larger. The leading term
is said to be the dominant term of the polyno-
mial function 
because, as 
becomes larger,
the absolute value of 
will be much larger than the absolute value of any of the other
terms. Because of this condition, you can determine the far-left and far-right behavior of
the polynomial by examining the leading coefficient
and the degree n of the polynomial.
Table 3.2 shows the far-left and far-right behavior of a polynomial function P with
leading term anxn.

Maximum and Minimum Values
Figure 3.10 illustrates the graph of a polynomial function of degree 3 with two turning
points, points at which the function changes from an increasing function to a decreasing
function, or vice versa. In general, the graph of a polynomial function of degree n has at
most 
turning points.
Turning points can be related to the concepts of maximum and minimum values of
a function. These concepts were introduced in the discussion of graphs of second-degree
equations in two variables earlier in the text. Recall that the minimum value of a func-
tion f is the smallest range value of f. It is often called the absolute minimum. The
maximum value of a function f is the largest range value of f. The maximum value of a
function is also called the absolute maximum. For the function whose graph is shown
in Figure 3.11, on page 274, the y value of point E is the absolute minimum. There are
no y values less than y5.
n - 1

Figure 3.11
Now consider 
the y value of turning point A in Figure 3.11. It is not the smallest
y value of every point on the graph of f; however, it is the smallest y value if we localize
our field of view to a small open interval containing 
It is for this reason that we refer
to 
as a local minimum, or relative minimum, of f. The y value of point C is also a rel-
ative minimum of f.
The function does not have an absolute maximum because it goes up both to the far
left and to the far right. The y value of point B is a relative maximum, as is the y value of
point D. The formal definitions of relative maximum and relative minimum are pre-
sented below.
Definition of Relative Minimum and Relative Maximum
If there is an open interval I containing c on which

Real Zeros, x-Intercepts, and Factors of a Polynomial

in the form 
where c is a real number.
Polynomial Functions, Real Zeros, Graphs, and Factors (x  c)
If P is a polynomial function and c is a real number, then all of the following state-
ments are equivalent in the following sense: If any one statement is true, then they
are all true, and if any one statement is false, then they are all false.

Procedure for Graphing Polynomial Functions
You may find that you can sketch the graph of a polynomial function just by plotting sev-
eral points; however, the following procedure will help you sketch the graph of many
polynomial functions in an efficient manner.
Procedure for Graphing Polynomial Functions
To graph P, follow these steps.
1. Determine the far-left and far-right behavior
Examine the leading coefficient
to determine the far-left and far-right behavior of the graph.
2. Find the y-intercept
Determine the y-intercept by evaluating 
3. Find the x-intercept or x-intercepts and determine the behavior of the graph
near the x-intercept or x-intercepts
If possible, find the x-intercepts by
factoring. If 
where c is a real number, is a factor of P, then 
is an
x-intercept of the graph. Use the Even and Odd Powers of 
Theorem to
determine where the graph crosses the x-axis and where the graph intersects
but does not cross the x-axis.
4. Find additional points on the graph
Find a few additional points (in addition
to the intercepts).
5. Check for symmetry
a.
The graph of an even function is symmetric with respect to the y-axis.
b.
The graph of an odd function is symmetric with respect to the origin.
6. Sketch the graph
Use all the information previously obtained to sketch the
graph of the polynomial function. The graph should be a smooth continuous
curve that passes through the points determined in steps 2 through 4. The
graph should have a maximum of 
turning points.

Solution
1. Determine the far-left and far-right behavior
The leading term is 
Because
the leading coefficient, 1, is positive and the degree of the polynomial, 3, is odd,
the graph of P goes down to the far left and up to the far right.
2. Find the y-intercept
The y-intercept is

3. Find the x-intercept or x-intercepts and determine the behavior of the graph
near the x-intercept or x-intercepts

Because 
is a factor of P, the point 
is an x-intercept of the graph of P.
Because x is a factor of P (think of x as 
), the point 
is an x-intercept of
the graph of P. Applying the Even and Odd Powers of 
Theorem allows us
to determine that the graph of P crosses the x-axis at 
and intersects but does
not cross the x-axis at

The function P is neither an even nor an odd function, so
the graph of P is not symmetric to either the y-axis or the origin.

The upward, downward, upward trends shown in

Cubic and quartic regression models often yield poor predictions. For instance, you
may have noticed that in Example 7 the cubic model predicts there will be fewer movie
screens in 2013 than in 2007. This scenario is unlikely because the number of screens has
been increasing every year since 2001. 
A quartic regression model will always model an application at least as well as a cubic
regression model. To illustrate this, find the quartic regression model for the data in
Example 7. This can be accomplished by choosing 7: QuartReg in the STAT CALC menu
(keystrokes

The coefficients of the

The coefficient of determination (R2  0.9721649195) and the graph of the quartic
model shown on the left below both confirm that this quartic model does provide a better
fit to the data in Example 7 than does the cubic model.
A graph of the quartic regression
The quartic model predicts about 
model and the data
101,677 indoor movie screens in 2013.
If you use the quartic model to predict the number of indoor movie screens in 2013,
you get 101,677 screens, as shown by the graph on the right above. This huge increase
(from 38,159 in 2007) is highly unlikely.

Multiple Zeros of a Polynomial Function
Recall that if P is a polynomial function then the values of x for which 
is equal to 0
are called the zeros of P or the roots of the equation 
A zero of a polynomial
function may be a multiple zero. For example, 
can be expressed in
factored form as 
Setting each factor equal to zero yields 
in both
cases. Thus 
has a zero of 
that occurs twice. The following defi-
nition will be most useful when we are discussing multiple zeros.
Definition of Multiple Zeros of a Polynomial Function
If a polynomial function P has 
as a factor exactly k times, then r is a zero
of multiplicity k of the polynomial function P.
EXAMPLE
The graph of the polynomial function
is shown in Figure 3.18. This polynomial function has
5 as a zero of multiplicity 2.
as a zero of multiplicity 3.
as a zero of multiplicity 1.
A zero of multiplicity 1 is generally referred to as a simple zero.
When searching for the zeros of a polynomial function, it is important that we know
how many zeros to expect. This question is answered completely in Section 3.4. For the
work in this section, the following result is valuable.

Study tip
The Rational Zero Theorem is one
of the most important theorems
of this chapter. It enables us to
narrow the search for rational
zeros to a finite list.
Caution
The Rational Zero Theorem gives
the possible rational zeros of a
polynomial function. That is, if P
has a rational zero, then it must
be one indicated by the theorem.
However, P may not have any
rational zeros. In the case of the
polynomial function in Example 1, 
the only rational zeros are 
and
2. The remaining rational numbers
in the list are not zeros of P.

Number of Zeros of a Polynomial Function
A polynomial function P of degree n has at most n zeros, where each zero of
multiplicity k is counted k times.
Rational Zero Theorem
The rational zeros of polynomial functions with integer coefficients can be found with the
aid of the following theorem.
Rational Zero Theorem
If 
has integer coefficients 
and 
is a rational zero (in simplest form) of P, then
p is a factor of the constant term 
.
q is a factor of the leading coefficient 
The Rational Zero Theorem often is used to make a list of all possible rational zeros
of a polynomial function. The list consists of all rational numbers of the form
where p
is an integer factor of the constant term 
and q is an integer factor of the leading
coefficient 
EXAMPLE 1
Apply the Rational Zero Theorem
Use the Rational Zero Theorem to list all possible rational zeros of
Solution
List all integers p that are factors of 12 and all integers q that are factors of 4.
Form all possible rational numbers using 
and 
for the
numerator and 
and 
for the denominator. By the Rational Zero Theorem,
the possible rational zeros are
It is not necessary to list a factor that is already listed in reduced form. For
example,

ZEROS OF POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS
Question • If
has integer coefficients and a leading
coefficient of 
must all the rational zeros of P be integers?
Upper and Lower Bounds for Real Zeros
A real number b is called an upper bound of the zeros of the polynomial function P if no
zero is greater than b. A real number b is called a lower bound of the zeros of P if no zero
is less than b. The following theorem is often used to find positive upper bounds and nega-
tive lower bounds for the real zeros of a polynomial function.
Upper- and Lower-Bound Theorem
Let 
be a polynomial function with real coefficients. Use synthetic division to
divide 
by 
where b is a nonzero real number.
Upper bound
a. If 
and the leading coefficient of P is positive, then
b is an upper bound for the real zeros of P provided none
of the numbers in the bottom row of the synthetic
division are negative.
b. If 
and the leading coefficient of P is negative,
then b is an upper bound for the real zeros of P provided
none of the numbers in the bottom row of the synthetic
division are positive.
Lower bound
If 
and the numbers in the bottom row of the
synthetic division alternate in sign (the number zero can
be considered positive or negative as needed to produce an
alternating sign pattern), then b is a lower bound for the
real zeros of P.
Upper and lower bounds are not unique. For example, if b is an upper bound for
the real zeros of P, then any number greater than b is also an upper bound. Likewise,
if a is a lower bound for the real zeros of P, then any number less than a is also a
lower bound.
EXAMPLE 2
Find Upper and Lower Bounds
According to the Upper- and Lower-Bound Theorem, what is the smallest positive inte-
ger that is an upper bound and the largest negative integer that is a lower bound of the
real zeros of P(x) = 2x3 + 7x2 - 4x - 14?

When you check for bounds, you
do not need to limit your choices
to the possible zeros given by the
Rational Zero Theorem. For
instance, in Example 2 the integer
4 is a lower bound; however,
4 is not one of the possible
zeros of P as given by the Rational
Zero Theorem.

as test values.
• No negative numbers
According to the Upper- and Lower-Bound Theorem, 2 is the smallest positive-integer
upper bound.

Descartes’ Rule of Signs
Descartes’ Rule of Signs is another theorem that is often used to obtain information about
the zeros of a polynomial function. In Descartes’ Rule of Signs, the number of variations
in sign of the coefficients of 
or 
refers to sign changes of the coefficients from
positive to negative or from negative to positive that we find when we examine successive
terms of the function. The terms are assumed to appear in order of descending powers of
x. For example, the polynomial function
1
2
3
has three variations in sign. The polynomial function
1
has one variation in sign.
Terms that have a coefficient of 0 are not counted as variations in sign and may be
ignored. For example,
1
has one variation in sign.

ZEROS OF POLYNOMIAL FUNCTIONS
Math Matters
Descartes’ Rule of Signs first
appeared in his La Géométrie
(1673). Although a proof of
Descartes’ Rule of Signs is beyond
the scope of this course, we can
see that a polynomial function
with no variations in sign cannot
have a positive zero. For instance,
consider
Each term of P is positive for any
positive value of x.  Thus P is
never zero for x 7 0.
P(x) = x3 + x2 + x + 1.
Descartes’ Rule of Signs
Let 
be a polynomial function with real coefficients and with the terms arranged
in order of decreasing powers of x.
The number of positive real zeros of 
is equal to the number of variations in
sign of 
or to that number decreased by an even integer.
The number of negative real zeros of 
is equal to the number of variations in
sign of 
or to that number decreased by an even integer.

Question • If

have two positive real zeros?
In applying Descartes’ Rule of Signs, we count each zero of multiplicity k as k zeros.
For instance,

positive real zeros. Factoring 
produces

positive zero of multiplicity 2.

If you have a graphing utility,
you can produce a graph similar
to the one below. By looking at
the x-intercepts of the graph, you
can reject as possible zeros some
of the values suggested by the
Rational Zero Theorem. This
will reduce the amount of work
that is necessary to find the
zeros of the polynomial function.
Zeros of a Polynomial Function
Guidelines for Finding the Zeros of a Polynomial Function with
Integer Coefficients
1. Gather general information
Determine the degree n of the polynomial
function. The number of distinct zeros of the polynomial function is at most n.
Apply Descartes’ Rule of Signs to find the possible number of positive zeros
and possible number of negative zeros.
2. Check suspects
Apply the Rational Zero Theorem to list rational numbers
that are possible zeros. Use synthetic division to test numbers in your list. If
you find an upper or a lower bound, then eliminate from your list any number
that is greater than the upper bound or less than the lower bound.
3. Work with the reduced polynomials
Each time a zero is found, you obtain a
reduced polynomial.
If a reduced polynomial is of degree 2, find its zeros either by factoring or
by applying the quadratic formula.
If the degree of a reduced polynomial is 3 or greater, repeat the preceding
steps for this polynomial.
Example 4 illustrates the procedure discussed in the preceding guidelines.

Solution
1. Gather general information
The degree of P is 4. Thus the number of zeros of P
is at most 4. By Descartes’ Rule of Signs, there are no positive zeros and there are
four, two, or no negative zeros.
2. Check suspects
By the Rational Zero Theorem, the possible negative rational
zeros of P are

The only natural number divisors of 1320 that are less than 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and

EXAMPLE 6
Use a Graphing Utility to Solve an Application
A carbon dioxide cartridge for a paintball rifle has the shape of a right circular
cylinder with a hemisphere at each end. The cylinder is 4 inches long, and the vol-
ume of the cartridge is 
cubic inches (approximately 6.3 cubic inches). In the figure
at the left, the common interior radius of the cylinder and the hemispheres is denoted
by x. Use a graphing utility to estimate, to the nearest hundredth of an inch, the length
of the radius x.
Solution
The volume of the cartridge is equal to the volume of the two hemispheres plus the
volume of the cylinder. Recall that the volume of a sphere of radius x is given by 
Therefore, the volume of a hemisphere is 
The volume of a right 
circular cylinder is 
where x is the radius of the base and h is the height of the 
cylinder. Thus the volume V of the cartridge is given by

Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
The German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) was the first to prove that
every polynomial function has at least one complex zero. This concept is so basic to the
study of algebra that it is called the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. The proof of
the Fundamental Theorem is beyond the scope of this text; however, it is important to
understand the theorem and its consequences. As you consider each of the following the-
orems, keep in mind that the terms complex coefficients and complex zeros include real
coefficients and real zeros because the set of real numbers is a subset of the set of com-
plex numbers.

The following theorem follows directly from the Linear Factor Theorem.
Number of Zeros of a Polynomial Function Theorem
If

, then

provided each zero is counted according to its multiplicity.
The Linear Factor Theorem and the Number of Zeros of a Polynomial Function
Theorem are referred to as existence theorems. They state that an nth-degree polynomial
will have n linear factors and n complex zeros, but they do not provide any information on
how to determine the linear factors or the zeros. In Example 1, we use previously devel-
oped methods to actually find the linear factors and zeros of some polynomial functions.

Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)
has often been referred to as the
Prince of Mathematics. His work
covered topics in algebra, calcu-

theory, non-Euclidean geometry,
astronomy, and physics, to name
but a few. The following quote by
Eric Temple Bell gives credence to
the fact that Gauss was one of the
greatest mathematicians of all
time. “Archimedes, Newton, and

Conjugate Pair Theorem
You may have noticed that the complex zeros of the polynomial function in Example 1
were complex conjugates. The following theorem shows that this is not a coincidence.
Conjugate Pair Theorem
If
is a complex zero of a polynomial function with real coefficients,
then the conjugate 
is also a complex zero of the polynomial function.
EXAMPLE 2
Use the Conjugate Pair Theorem to Find Zeros
Find all the zeros of 
, given that 
is a zero.
Solution
Because the coefficients are real numbers and 
is a zero, the Conjugate Pair
Theorem implies that 
also must be a zero. Using synthetic division with 
and 
we have
• The coefficients of the 
reduced polynomial
• The coefficients of the next 
reduced polynomial
The resulting reduced polynomial is 
which has 
and

the four zeros of

A graph of 
is shown in Figure 3.20. Because
the polynomial in Example 2 is a fourth-degree polynomial and because we have verified
that

the x-axis.
When performing synthetic division with complex numbers, it is helpful to write the
coefficients of the given polynomial as complex coefficients. For instance, 
can be
written as

Question • Is it possible for a third-degree polynomial function with real coefficients to have two
real zeros and one nonreal complex zero?
Recall that the real zeros of a polynomial function P are the x-coordinates of the x-
intercepts of the graph of P. This important connection between the real zeros of a poly-
nomial function and the x-intercepts of the graph of the polynomial function is the basis
for using a graphing utility to solve equations. Careful analysis of the graph of a polyno-
mial function and your knowledge of the properties of polynomial functions can be used
to solve many polynomial equations.

Answer • No. Because the coefficients of the polynomial are real numbers, the nonreal complex
zeros of the polynomial function must occur as conjugate pairs.

Let 
The real zeros of P are the real solutions of the
equation. Use a graphing utility to graph P. See Figure 3.21.
From the graph, it appears that

Because the graph of P intersects but does not cross the x-axis at 
we know that 3
is a multiple zero of P with an even multiplicity.
• Coefficients of P
• The remainder is 0. Thus 3 is a zero.
By the Number of Zeros Theorem, there are three more zeros of P. Use synthetic
division to show that 3 is also a zero of the reduced polynomial 
• Coefficients of reduced polynomial
• The remainder is 0. Thus 3 is a zero of 
multiplicity 2.
We now have 3 as a double root of the original equation, and from the last line of

Note the behavior of the graph as x takes on values that are close to 2 but less than 2.
Mathematically, we say that “x approaches 2 from the left.”
From this table and the graph, it appears that as x approaches 2 from the left, the functional
values 
decrease without bound.
In this case, we say that “
approaches negative infinity.”
Now observe the behavior of the graph as x takes on values that are close to 2 but
greater than 2. Mathematically, we say that “x approaches 2 from the right.”
From this table and the graph, it appears that as x approaches 2 from the right, the func-
tional values 
increase without bound.
In this case, we say that “
approaches positive infinity.”
Now consider the values of 
as x increases without bound. The following table
gives values of 
for selected values of x.
As x increases without bound, the values of 
become closer to 1.
Now let the values of x decrease without bound. The following table gives the values
of 
for selected values of x.
As x decreases without bound, the values of 
become closer to 1.
When we are discussing functional values that increase or decrease without bound, it
is convenient to use mathematical notation. The notation
means that the functional values 
increase without bound as x approaches a from the
right. Recall that the symbol 
does not represent a real number but is used merely to
describe the concept of a variable taking on larger and larger values without bound. See
Figure 3.24a.
The notation
means that the function values 
increase without bound as x approaches a from the left.

The line is said to be a vertical asymptote of the graph.
Definition of a Vertical Asymptote
The line

as x approaches a from either the left or right.

Figure 3.25 illustrates some of the ways in which the graph of a rational function may
approach its horizontal asymptote. It is common practice to display the asymptotes of the
graph of a rational function by using dashed lines. Although a rational function may have
several vertical asymptotes, it can have at most one horizontal asymptote. The graph may
intersect its horizontal asymptote.

Geometrically, a line is an asymptote of a curve if the distance between the line and a
point 
on the curve approaches zero as the distance between the origin and the point
P increases without bound.
Vertical asymptotes of the graph of a rational function can be found by using the fol-
lowing theorem.

To find the vertical asymptotes, determine the real zeros of the denominator. The

totes. See Figure 3.26.

Here is a specific example of how we can use the Behavior Near a Vertical Asymptote
Theorem. Consider the rational function
The exponent of 
is 1. Because 1 is an odd number, the graph of F will approach
on one side of the vertical asymptote 
and it will approach 
on the other side.
The exponent of 
is 2. Because 2 is an even number, the graph of F will approach 
on both sides of the vertical asymptote 
or it will approach 
on both sides of 
We can examine the factors of F to determine the exact manner in which F approaches
its vertical asymptotes. For instance, as 
the factor 
approaches 0 through
positive values and the factor 
approaches 
through positive values.
Thus, as 
the denominator of F approaches 
through positive values and
the numerator of F approaches 2 through positive values. From this analysis, we see that
as 
the quotient of x and
will be positive and that it will become
larger and larger as x gets closer and closer to 2. That is, as 
. We could use
a similar analysis to determine the behavior of F as 
however, we have already
determined that F approaches 
on one side of 
and 
on the other side. Thus
we can conclude that as 
See Figure 3.28.
As 
the factor 
approaches 3 through positive values and the factor
approaches 
through positive values. Thus, as 
the denominator
of F approaches 
through positive values and the numerator of F approaches 5
through positive values. From this analysis, we see that as 
the quotient of x and
will be positive and that it will become larger and larger as x gets closer
and closer to 5. That is, as 
We have already determined that F approaches
on both sides of 
or F approaches 
on both sides of 
Thus we can con-
clude that as

Theorem on Horizontal Asymptotes
Let

asymptote of the graph of F.
2. If 
then the line given by

By the Theorem on Horizontal Asymptotes, the x-axis is the horizontal
asymptote of f. See the graph of f in Figure 3.29.
b.
The numerator 
and the denominator 
of g are both of degree 2. By the
Theorem on Horizontal Asymptotes, the line 
is the horizontal asymptote of g.
See the graph of g in Figure 3.30.
c.
The degree of the numerator 
is larger than the degree of the denominator
so by the Theorem on Horizontal Asymptotes, the graph of h has no hori-
zontal asymptotes.

Asymptotes
The denominator 
has no real zeros, so the graph of f has no
vertical asymptotes. The numerator and denominator both are of degree 2. The
leading coefficients are 2 and 1, respectively. By the Theorem on Horizontal 
Asymptotes, the graph of f has a horizontal asymptote of 
2.

Generally, it is necessary to determine points in all inter-
vals. However, because f is an even function, its graph is symmetric with respect to

Solution
1.
Asymptotes
The denominator 
has zeros 
and 1;
because there are no common factors of the numerator and the denominator, the
lines 
and 
are vertical asymptotes.
The numerator and denominator both are of degree 2. The leading coefficients
of the numerator and denominator are both 1. Thus h has the horizontal asymptote
2.
Intercepts
The numerator 
has no real zeros, so the graph of h has no 
x-intercepts. Because 
h has the y-intercept
3.
Symmetry
By applying the tests for symmetry, we can determine that the graph
of h is not symmetric with respect to the origin or with respect to the y-axis.

Additional points
The intervals determined by the vertical asymptotes are

Plot a few points from each interval.
The graph of h will intersect the horizontal asymptote

Behavior near asymptotes
The manner in which h approaches its vertical asymptote
as 
can be determined by examining the numerator and the factors
of the denominators as 
. For instance, as 
, the numerator 
approaches 
through positive values. As 
, the 
factor in the denominator approaches 0 through negative values and the 
factor in the denominator approaches 
through negative values. Thus, as 
the denominator of h approaches 
through positive values. From this
analysis, we see that as 
, the quotient of the numerator and the denomina-
tor will be positive, and it will become larger and larger as 
. That is,
as
We could use a similiar analysis to determine the behavior of h as
However, the Behavior Near a Vertical Asymptote Theorem indicates that h
approaches 
on one side of the vertical asymptote 
and h approaches
on the other side. Thus we know that

The following theorem can be used to determine which rational functions have a slant
asymptote.
Theorem on Slant Asymptotes
The rational function given by 
where 
and 
have no
common factors, has a slant asymptote if the degree of 
is one greater than the
degree of 
To find the slant asymptote, divide 
by 
and write

Solution
Because the degree of the numerator 
is exactly one larger than the
degree of the denominator 
and f is in simplest form, f has a slant asymp-
tote. To find the asymptote, divide 
by 
Therefore,
and the line given by 
is the slant asymptote for the graph of f. Figure 3.34
shows the graph of f and its slant asymptote.

Graphing Rational Functions That Have a Common Factor
If a rational function has a numerator and denominator that have a common factor, then
you should reduce the rational function to simplest form before you apply the general pro-
cedure for sketching the graph of a rational function.

Exploring Concepts with Technology
Finding Zeros of a Polynomial Using Mathematica
Computer algebra systems (CAS) are computer programs that are used to solve equa-
tions, graph functions, simplify algebraic expressions, and help us perform many other
mathematical tasks. In this exploration, we will demonstrate how to use one of these
programs, Mathematica, to find the zeros of a polynomial function.
Recall that a zero of a function P is a number x for which 
The idea
behind finding a zero of a polynomial function by using a CAS is to solve the polyno-
mial equation 
for x.
Two commands in Mathematica that can be used to solve an equation are Solve
and NSolve. (Mathematica is sensitive about syntax, or the way in which an expression
is typed.You must use uppercase and lowercase letters as we indicate.) Solve will
attempt to find an exact solution of the equation; NSolve will attempt to find approx-
imate solutions. Here are some examples.
To find the exact values of the zeros of 
input the
following. (Note: The two equals signs are necessary.)

provided you place an open circle on the graph at x = a. The height of
the open circle can be determined by evaluating the reduced rational
function at x = a.

LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS
CHAPTER 4
Applications of Exponential 
and Logarithmic Functions
Exponential and logarithmic functions are often used to model data and
make predictions. For instance in Exercise 19, page 412, an exponential
function is used to model the price of a lift ticket at a ski resort for recent
years. The function is also used to predict the price of a lift ticket in 2014.
Logarithmic functions can be
used to scale very large (or
very small) numbers so that
they are easier to comprehend.
In Exercise 67, page 379, a
logarithmic function is used to
determine the Richter scale
magnitude of an earthquake.
The photo to the right shows
some of the damage caused by
the San Francisco–Oakland earthquake, which struck during the pregame
warm-up for the third game of the 1989 World Series. It was the first
powerful earthquake in the United States to be broadcast live by a major
television network. This earthquake measured 7.1 on the Richter scale and
was responsible for 67 deaths.

Introduction to Inverse Functions
Consider the “doubling function” 
that doubles every input. Some of the ordered
pairs of this function are
Now consider the “halving function” 
that takes one-half of every input. Some of 
the ordered pairs of this function are
Observe that the ordered pairs of 
are the ordered pairs of with the order of the coordi-
nates reversed. The following two examples illustrate this concept.

Definition of an Inverse Function
If the ordered pairs of a function 
are the ordered pairs of a function with the
order of the coordinates reversed, then 
is the inverse function of
Consider a function and its inverse function . Because the ordered pairs of are the
ordered pairs of with the order of the coordinates reversed, the domain of the inverse
function 
is the range of

Note
In this section, our primary interest
is finding the inverse of a function;
however, we can also find the
inverse of a relation. Recall that a
relation r is any set of ordered
pairs. The inverse of r is the set of
ordered pairs formed by reversing
the order of the coordinates of the

INVERSE FUNCTIONS
This set of ordered pairs is not a function because there are ordered pairs, for instance
and 
with the same first coordinate and different second coordinates. In this
case, S has an inverse relation but not an inverse function.
A graph of S is shown in Figure 4.1. Note that 
and 
produce the same
value of y. Thus the graph of S fails the horizontal line test; therefore, S is not a one-to-one
function. This observation is used in the following theorem.
Condition for an Inverse Function
A function f has an inverse function if and only if f is a one-to-one function.
Recall that increasing functions and decreasing functions are one-to-one functions. Thus
we can state the following theorem.
Alternative Condition for an Inverse Function
If f is an increasing function or a decreasing function, then f has an inverse function.
Question • Which of the functions graphed below has an inverse function?
If a function g is the inverse of a function f, we usually denote the inverse function by
rather than g. For the doubling and halving functions f and g discussed on page 334,
we write
Graphs of Inverse Functions

pairs of with the order of the coordinates reversed, we can use them to create a graph

Answer • The graph of f is the graph of an increasing function. Therefore, f is a one-to-one func-
tion and has an inverse function. The graph of h is the graph of a decreasing function.
Therefore, h is a one-to-one function and has an inverse function. The graph of g is not
the graph of a one-to-one function. g does not have an inverse function.

INVERSE FUNCTIONS
Composition of a Function and Its Inverse
Observe the effect of forming the composition of 
and 
.
This property of the composition of inverse functions always holds true. When taking the
composition of inverse functions, the inverse function reverses the effect of the original
function. For the two functions above, f doubles a number, and g halves a number. If you
double a number and then take one-half of the result, you are back to the original number.
Composition of Inverse Functions Property
If f is a one-to-one function, then 
is the inverse function of f if and only if
for all x in the domain of 
and
for all x in the domain of f.

See Figure 4.6. This anomaly is important if a graphing calculator is being used to

Exponential Functions
When an airport parking facility opened in 1968, it charged $0.75 for all day parking. Since
then it has doubled its daily parking fee every 8 years as shown in the following table.
Table 4.1
In Figure 4.13, we have plotted the data in the above table and modeled the upward
trend in the parking fee by a smooth curve. This model is based on an exponential func-
tion, which is one of the major topics of this chapter. 
The effectiveness of a drug, which is used for sedation during a surgical procedure,
depends on the concentration of the drug in the patient. Through natural body chemistry,
the amount of this drug in the body decreases over time. The graph in Figure 4.14 models
this decrease. This model is another example of an exponential model. 
Definition of an Exponential Function
The exponential function with base b is defined by
where 
and x is a real number.
The base b of 
is required to be positive. If the base were a negative number, the
value of the function would be a complex number for some values of x. For instance, if
f(x) = bx
b 7 0, b Z 1,
f(x) = bx

To avoid complex number values of a
function, the base of any exponential function must be a positive number. Also, b is defined
such that 
because 
is a constant function.
You may have noticed that in the definition of an exponential function the exponent x
is a real number. We have already worked with expressions of the form 
, where b 
 0
and x is a rational number. For instance,
To extend the meaning of 
to real numbers, we need to give meaning to 
when x
is an irrational number. For example, what is the meaning of 
? To completely answer
this question requires concepts from calculus. However, for our purposes, we can think of
as the unique real number that is approached by 5x as x takes on ever closer rational
number approximations of . For instance, each successive number in the following list is
a closer approximation of 
than the number to its left. 
A calculator can be used to show that 
. A computer algebra system,
such as Mathematica, can produce even closer decimal approximations of 
by using closer
rational-number approximations of . For instance, if you use 3.1415926535897932385 as
your approximation of , then Mathematica produces 156.9925453088659076 as an approx-
imation of 
.
In a similar manner, we can think of 
as the number that is approached by ever
closer rational-number approximations of 
. For instance, each successive number in the
following list is a closer approximation of 
than the number to its left.
A calculator can be used to show that 
It can be shown that the properties of rational-number exponents, as stated in Section P.2,
hold for real exponents.

Natural Exponential Function
The irrational number 
is often used in applications that involve circles. Another irra-
tional number, denoted by the letter e, is useful in many applications that involve growth
or decay.
Definition of e
The letter e represents the number that
approaches as n increases without bound.
The letter e was chosen in honor of the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. He was able
to compute the value of e to several decimal places by evaluating 
for large 
values of n, as shown in Table 4.5 on page 352.

Math Matters
Leonhard Euler (1707–1783)
Some mathematicians consider
Euler to be the greatest mathe-
matician of all time. He certainly
was the most prolific writer of
mathematics of all time. He made
substantial contributions in the
areas of number theory, geometry,
calculus, differential equations, dif-
ferential geometry, topology, com-
plex variables, and analysis, to
name but a few. Euler was the first
to introduce many of the mathe-
matical notations that we use
today. For instance, he introduced
the symbol i for the square root of
-1, the symbol p for pi, the func-
tional notation f (x), and the letter
e for the base of the natural expo-
nential function. Euler’s computa-
tional skills were truly amazing.
The mathematician François Arago
remarked, “Euler calculated with-
out apparent effort, as men
breathe, or as eagles sustain them-
selves in the wind.”

EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS

The value of e accurate to eight decimal places is 2.71828183.
The base of an exponential function can be any positive real number other than 1. The
number 10 is a convenient base to use for some situations, but we will see that the number
e is often the best base to use in real-life applications. The exponential function with e as
the base is known as the natural exponential function.
Definition of the Natural Exponential Function
For all real numbers x, the function defined by
is called the natural exponential function.
A calculator can be used to evaluate 
for specific values of x. For instance,
and
On a TI-83/TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus calculator, the 
function is located above the 
key.
To graph 
use a calculator to find the range values for a few domain values.
The range values in Table 4.6 have been rounded to the nearest tenth.

Plot the points given in Table 4.6, and then connect the points with a smooth curve. Because
we know that the graph is an increasing function. To the far left, the graph will
approach the x-axis. The y-intercept is

anticipated that the graph of

function to model the temperature of a cup of coffee.

70°F. The temperature T of the coffee, in degrees Fahrenheit, after t minutes is given by

placed in the room.
b.
Use a graphing utility to determine when the temperature of the coffee will

The weekly revenue R, in dollars, from the sale of a product varies with time according
to the function
where x is the number of weeks that have passed since the product was put on the mar-
ket. What will the weekly revenue approach as time goes by?
Solution
Method 1
Use a graphing utility to graph
and use the TRACE feature to see what
happens to the revenue as the time increases. The
graph on the right shows that as the weeks go by,
the weekly revenue will increase and approach
$220 per week.
Method 2
Write the revenue function in the
following form.
•
As x increases without bound, 
increases without bound, and the fraction
approaches 0. Therefore, as

Photochromatic Eyeglass Lenses Photochromatic eye-
glass lenses contain molecules of silver chloride or silver
halide. These molecules are transparent in the absence of ultra-
violet (UV) rays. UV rays are normally absent in artificial
lighting. However, when the lenses are exposed to UV rays, as
in direct sunlight, the molecules take on a new molecular struc-
ture, which causes the lenses to darken. The number of mole-
cules affected varies with the intensity of the UV rays. The
intensity of UV rays is measured using a scale called the UV
index. On this scale, a value near 0 indicates a low UV inten-
sity and a value near 10 indicates a high UV intensity.
For the photochromatic lenses shown below, the function
models the transparency 
of the lenses as a
function of the UV index .
a. Find the transparency of these lenses, to the nearest tenth of
a percent, when they are exposed to light rays with a UV
index of 3.5.

tochromatic lenses to have a transparency of 45%? Round

The Pay It Forward Model In the movie Pay It Forward,
Trevor McKinney, played by Haley Joel Osment, is given a
school assignment to “think of an idea to change the world—
and then put it into action.” In response to this assignment,
Trevor develops a pay it forward project. In this project, any-
one who benefits from another person’s good deed must do a
good deed for three additional people. Each of these three peo-
ple is then obligated to do a good deed for another three peo-
ple, and so on.

Logarithmic Functions
Every exponential function of the form 
is a one-to-one function and therefore
has an inverse function. Sometimes we can determine the inverse of a function represented
by an equation by interchanging the variables of its equation and then solving for the
dependent variable. If we attempt to use this procedure for 
we obtain
• Interchange the variables.
None of our previous methods can be used to solve the equation 
for the exponent
y. Thus we need to develop a new procedure. One method would be to merely write
Although this would work, it is not concise. We need a compact notation to represent “y
is the power of b that produces x.” This more compact notation is given in the following
definition.

performing an addition.

Applied Physiology
In the study The Pace of Life, M. H. Bornstein and H. G. Bornstein (Nature, Vol. 259,
pp. 557–558, 1976) reported that as the population of a city increases, the average
walking speed of a pedestrian also increases. An approximate relation between the
average pedestrian walking speed s, in miles per hour, and the population x, in thou-
sands, of a city is given by the function
a.
Determine the average walking speed, to the nearest tenth of a mile per hour, in
San Francisco, which has a population of 765,000, and in Round Rock, Texas,
which has a population of 86,000.

3.1 miles per hour. Round to the nearest hundred-thousand.

Math Matters
Although logarithms were
originally developed to assist
with computations, logarithmic
functions have a much broader
use today. They are often used in
such disciplines as geology,
acoustics, chemistry, physics, and
economics, to name a few.

Astronomy Astronomers measure the apparent
brightness of a star by a unit called the apparent
magnitude. This unit was created in the second century B.C.
when the Greek astronomer Hipparchus classified the relative
brightness of several stars. In his list, he assigned the number
1 to the stars that appeared to be the brightest (Sirius, Vega, and
Deneb). They are first-magnitude stars. Hipparchus assigned
the number 2 to all the stars in the Big Dipper. They are second-
magnitude stars. The following table shows the relationship
between a star’s brightness relative to a first-magnitude star
and the star’s apparent magnitude. Notice from the table that a
first-magnitude star appears to be about 2.51 times as bright as
a second-magnitude star.

The quotient property and the power property can be proved in a similar manner. See

The properties of logarithms are often used to rewrite logarithmic expressions in an
equivalent form. The process of using the product or quotient rules to rewrite a single log-
arithm as the sum or difference of two or more logarithms, or using the power property to
rewrite 
in its equivalent form 
is called expanding the logarithmic
expression. We illustrate this process in Example 1.

of 3 is equal to 81?” Because 
we have 
Now suppose that we need
to determine the value of 
In this case, we need to find the power of 3 that produces
50. Because

the value we are seeking is somewhere between 3
and 4. The following procedure can be used to produce an estimate of

Applying logarithmic properties
gives us
• Logarithm-of-each-side property
• Power property
• Solve for y.
Thus
In the preceding procedure we could just as well have used loga-
rithms of any base and arrived at the same value. Thus any logarithm can be expressed in terms
of logarithms of any base we wish. This general result is summarized in the following formula.

Logarithmic Scales
Logarithmic functions are often used to scale very large (or very small) numbers into num-
bers that are easier to comprehend. For instance, the Richter scale magnitude of an earth-
quake uses a logarithmic function to convert the intensity of the earthquake’s shock waves
I into a number M, which for most earthquakes is in the range of 0 to 10. The intensity I
of an earthquake is often given in terms of the constant 
where 
is the intensity of the
smallest earthquake (called a zero-level earthquake) that can be measured on a seismo-
graph near the earthquake’s epicenter. The following formula is used to compute the
Richter scale magnitude of an earthquake.

The earthquake in Chile was approximately 251 times as intense as the San Francisco
earthquake.

Seismologists generally determine the Richter scale magnitude of an earthquake by
examining a seismogram. See Figure 4.34.
Figure 4.34
The magnitude of an earthquake cannot be determined just by examining the ampli-
tude of a seismogram because this amplitude decreases as the distance between the epicen-
ter of the earthquake and the observation station increases. To account for the distance
between the epicenter and the observation station, a seismologist examines a seismogram
for small waves called p-waves and larger waves called s-waves. The Richter scale magni-
tude M of an earthquake is a function of both the amplitude A of the s-waves and the dif-
ference in time t between the occurrence of the s-waves and the occurrence of the p-waves.
In the 1950s, Charles Richter developed the following formula to determine the magnitude
of an earthquake from the data in a seismogram.
Amplitude–Time–Difference Formula
The Richter scale magnitude M of an earthquake is given by
where A is the amplitude, in millimeters, of the s-waves on a seismogram and t is
the difference in time, in seconds, between the s-waves and the p-waves.

Logarithmic scales are also used in chemistry. One example concerns the pH of a liq-
uid, which is a measure of the liquid’s acidity or alkalinity. (You may have tested the pH
of the water in a swimming pool or an aquarium.) Pure water, which is considered neutral,
has a pH of 7.0. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 0 corresponding to the most acidic
solutions and 14 to the most alkaline. Lemon juice has a pH of about 2, whereas house-
hold ammonia measures about 11.
Specifically, the pH of a solution is a function of the hydronium-ion concentration of
the solution. Because the hydronium-ion concentration of a solution can be very small
(with values such as 0.00000001 mole per liter), pH uses a logarithmic scale.
Definition of the pH of a Solution
The pH of a solution with a hydronium-ion concentration of

The pH scale was created by the
Danish biochemist Søren Sørensen
in 1909 to measure the acidity of
water used in the brewing of beer.
pH is an abbreviation for pondus
hydrogenii, which translates as
“potential hydrogen.”
Note
The Richter scale magnitude is
usually rounded to the nearest
tenth.

PROPERTIES OF LOGARITHMS AND LOGARITHMIC SCALES
Figure 4.35 illustrates the pH scale, along with the corresponding hydronium-ion con-
centrations. A solution on the left half of the scale, with a pH of less than 7, is an acid, and
a solution on the right half of the scale is an alkaline solution, or a base. Because the scale
is logarithmic, a solution with a pH of 5 is 10 times more acidic than a solution with a pH
of 6. From Example 9, we see that the orange juice, milk, and rainwater are acids whereas
the baking soda solution is a base.

Exponential Growth and Decay
In many applications, a quantity changes at a rate proportional to the amount present. In
these applications, the amount present at time is given by a special function called an
exponential growth function or an exponential decay function.
Definition of Exponential Growth and Decay Functions
If a quantity 
increases or decreases at a rate proportional to the amount present
at time 
then the quantity can be modeled by
where 
is the value of 
at time 
and is a constant called the growth rate
constant.
If is positive, 
increases as increases and 
is called an exponen-
tial growth function. See Figure 4.39.
If is negative, 
decreases as increases and 
is called an exponen-
tial decay function. See Figure 4.40.

Many radioactive materials decrease in mass exponentially over time. This decrease,
called radioactive decay, is measured in terms of half-life, which is defined as the

Carbon Dating
The bone tissue in all living animals contains both carbon-12, which is nonradioactive,
and carbon-14, which is radioactive and has a half-life of approximately 5730 years. See
Figure 4.41. As long as the animal is alive, the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 remains
constant. When the animal dies 
the carbon-14 begins to decay. Thus a bone that
has a smaller ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 is older than a bone that has a larger ratio.
The percent of carbon-14 present at time t, in years, is
The process of using the percent of carbon-14 present at a given time to estimate the
age of a bone is called carbon dating.

Compound Interest Formulas
Interest is money paid for the use of money. The interest I is called simple interest if it is
a fixed percent r, per time period t, of the amount of money invested. The amount of
money invested is called the principal P. Simple interest is computed using the formula
For example, if $1000 is invested at 12% for 3 years, the simple interest is
The balance after t years is 
In the preceding example, the
$1000 invested for 3 years produced $360 interest. Thus the balance after 3 years is
In many financial transactions, interest is added to the principal at regular intervals so
that interest is paid on interest, as well as on the principal. Interest earned in this manner
is called compound interest. For example, if $1000 is invested at 12% annual interest
compounded annually for 3 years, then the total interest after 3 years is
First-year interest
Second-year interest
Third-year interest
• Total interest
This method of computing the balance can be tedious and time-consuming. A compound
interest formula can be used to determine the balance due after t years of compounding.
Note that if P dollars is invested at an interest rate of r per year, then the balance after
1 year is 
where Pr represents the interest earned for the year.
Observe that 
is the product of the original principal P and 
If the amount 
is
reinvested for another year, then the balance after the second year is
Successive reinvestments lead to the results shown in Table 4.12. The equation
is valid if r is the annual interest rate paid during each of the t years.
If r is an annual interest rate and n is the number of compounding periods per year,
then the interest rate each period is 
, and the number of compounding periods after t
years is nt. Thus the compound interest formula is as follows.
Compound Interest Formula
A principal P invested at an annual interest rate r, expressed as a decimal and
compounded n times per year for t years, produces the balance

Restricted Growth Models
The exponential growth function 
is an unrestricted growth model that does
not consider any limited resources that eventually will curb population growth.
The logistic model is a restricted growth model that takes into consideration the
effects of limited resources. The logistic model was developed by Pierre Verhulust in
1836.
Definition of the Logistic Model (Restricted Growth Model)
The magnitude of a population at time 
is given by
where c is the carrying capacity (the maximum
population that can be supported by available
resources as 
) and b is a positive constant
called the growth rate constant.
The initial population is 
The con-
stant a is related to the initial population 
and

Modeling World Record Times in the Men’s Mile Race
In the early 1950s, many people speculated that no runner
would ever run a mile race in under 4 minutes. During the period
from 1913 to 1945, the world record in the mile event had been
reduced from 4.14.4 (4 minutes, 14.4 seconds) to 4.01.4, but no
one seemed capable of running a sub-four-minute mile. Then, in
1954, Roger Bannister broke through the four-minute barrier by
running a mile in 3.59.6. In 1999, the current record of 3.43.13
was established. It is fun to think about future record times in the
mile race. Will they ever go below 3 minutes, 30 seconds? Below
3 minutes, 20 seconds? What about a sub-three-minute mile?
A declining logistic function that closely models the
world record times WR, in seconds, in the men’s mile run from
1913 
to 1999

Analyzing Scatter Plots
In Section 2.7 we used linear and quadratic functions to model several data sets. However,
in some applications, data can be modeled more closely by using exponential or logarith-
mic functions. For instance, Figure 4.43 illustrates some scatter plots that can be modeled
effectively by exponential and logarithmic functions.
The terms concave upward and concave downward are often used to describe a graph.
For instance, Figure 4.44a and 4.44b show the graphs of two increasing functions that join
the points P and Q. The graphs of f and g differ in that they bend in different directions. We
can distinguish between these two types of “bending” by examining the positions of tangent
lines to the graphs. In Figure 4.44c and 4.44d, tangent lines (in red) have been drawn to the
graphs of f and g. The graph of f lies above its tangent lines, and the graph of g lies below
its tangent lines. The function f is said to be concave upward, and g is concave downward.

Definition of Concavity
If the graph of f lies above all of its tangents on an interval 
then f is
concave upward on
If the graph of f lies below all of its tangents on an interval 
then f is
concave downward on
An examination of the graphs in Figure 4.43 on page 405 shows that the graphs of
all exponential functions of the form 
are concave upward.
The graphs of increasing logarithmic functions of the form 
are
concave downward, and the graphs of decreasing logarithmic functions of the form
, are concave upward.
In Example 1, we analyze scatter plots to determine whether the shape of the scatter
plot can be best approximated by a function that is concave upward or concave downward.
Question • Is the graph of 
concave upward or concave downward?
EXAMPLE 1
Analyze Scatter Plots
For each of the following data sets, determine whether the most suitable model of the
data would be an increasing exponential function or an increasing logarithmic function.
Solution
For each set, construct a scatter plot of the data. See Figure 4.45.
Figure 4.45
The scatter plot of A suggests that A is an increasing function that is concave upward.
Thus an increasing exponential function would be the most suitable model for data set A.
The scatter plot of B suggests that B is an increasing function that is concave
downward. Thus an increasing logarithmic function would be the most suitable model
for data set B.

MODELING DATA WITH EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS
Modeling Data
The methods of modeling data using exponential or logarithmic functions are similar to the
methods used in Section 2.7 to model data using linear or quadratic functions. Here is a
summary of the modeling process.
Modeling Process
Use a graphing utility to perform the following steps.
1. Construct a scatter plot of the data to determine which type of function will
effectively model the data.
2. Find the equation of the modeling function and the correlation coefficient
or the coefficient of determination for the equation.
3. Examine the correlation coefficient or the coefficient of determination and
view a graph that displays both the modeling function and the scatter plot to
determine how well your function fits the data.
In the following example we use the modeling process to find an exponential function that
closely models the value of a diamond as a function of its weight.
EXAMPLE 2
Model an Application with an Exponential Function
A diamond merchant has determined the values of several white diamonds that have
different weights (measured in carats) but are similar in quality. See Table 4.13.
Table 4.13
Find a function that models the values of the diamonds as a function of their weights,
and use the function to predict the value of a 3.5-carat diamond of similar quality.
Solution
1. Construct a scatter plot of the data

From the scatter plot in Figure 4.46, it appears that the data can be closely modeled
by an exponential function of the form

Integrating Technology
Most graphing utilities have
built-in routines that can be
used to determine the exponen-
tial or logarithmic regression
function that models a set of
data. On a TI-83/TI-83 Plus/
TI-84 Plus calculator, the
ExpReg instruction is used to
find the exponential regression
function and the LnReg instruc-
tion is used to find the logarith-
mic regression function. The 
TI-83/TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus cal-
culator does not show the value
of the regression coefficient r or
the coefficient of determination
unless the DiagnosticOn com-
mand has been entered. The
DiagnosticOn command is in
the CATALOG menu.
Note
The value of a diamond is gener-
ally determined by its color, cut,
clarity, and carat weight. These
characteristics of a diamond
are known as the four c’s. In
Example 2, we have assumed that
the color, cut, and clarity of all the
diamonds are similar. This assump-
tion enables us to model the value
of each diamond as a function of
just its carat weight.
(continued)

2. Find the equation of the modeling function
The calculator display in Figure 4.47 shows 
that the exponential regression equation is
where x is the carat weight 
of the diamond and y is the value of the diamond.
3. Examine the correlation coefficient or the
coefficient of determination
The correlation
coefficient 
is close to 1. This 
indicates that the exponential regression function
provides a good fit for the data.
The graph in Figure 4.48 also shows that the exponential regression function
provides a good model for the data. To estimate the value of a 3.5-carat diamond,
substitute 3.5 for x in the exponential regression function or use the VALUE
command in the CALCULATE menu to evaluate the exponential regression
function at 
. See Figure 4.49.
Figure 4.48
Figure 4.49
According to the exponential regression function, the value of a 3.5-carat diamond
of similar quality is about $12,610.

When you are selecting a function to model a given set of data, try to find a function
that provides a good fit to the data and is likely to produce realistic predictions. The fol-
lowing guidelines may facilitate the selection process.
Guidelines for Selecting a Modeling Function
1. Use a graphing utility to construct a scatter plot of the data.
2. Compare the graphical features of the scatter plot with the graphical features
of the basic modeling functions available on the graphing utility: linear,
quadratic, cubic, exponential, logarithmic, or logistic. Pay particular attention
to the concave nature of each function. Eliminate those functions that do not
display the desired concavity.
3. Use the graphing utility to find the equation of each type of function you
identified in Step 2 as a possible model.
4. Determine how well each function fits the given data, and compare the graphs
of the functions to determine which function is most likely to produce realistic
predictions.

Math Matters
The Hope Diamond, shown below,
is the world’s largest deep blue
diamond. It has a weight of
45.52 carats. We should not expect
the function
in Example 2 to yield an accurate
value of the Hope Diamond
because the Hope Diamond is not
the same type of diamond as the
diamonds in Table 4.13 on
page 407, and its weight is much
larger than the weights of the
diamonds in Table 4.13.

MODELING DATA WITH EXPONENTIAL AND LOGARITHMIC FUNCTIONS
EXAMPLE 3
Select a Modeling Function and Make a Prediction
Table 4.14 shows the winning times in the women’s Olympic 100-meter
freestyle event for the years 1964 to 2008.
Table 4.14 Women’s Olympic 100-Meter Freestyle,
1964 to 2008
Source: About.com.
Find a function to model the data, and use the function to predict the winning time in
the women’s Olympic 100-meter freestyle event for 2016.
Solution
Construct a scatter plot of the data. See Figure 4.50.
(Note: This scatter plot was produced using 
to represent 1964, 
to represent 1968,
, and
to represent 2008.) The general shape of the
scatter plot suggests that we consider functions
whose graphs are decreasing and concave upward.
Thus we consider a decreasing exponential function
and a decreasing logarithmic function as possible
models. Use a graphing utility to find the exponen-
tial regression function and the logarithmic regres-
sion function for the data. See Figure 4.51 and Figure 4.52.
Figure 4.51
Figure 4.52
The exponential function is 
and the logarithmic
function is 
. The coefficient of determination 
for the logarithmic regression is larger than the coefficient of determination for the
exponential regression. See Figure 4.51 and Figure 4.52. Thus the logarithmic regression
function provides a better fit to the data than does the exponential regression function.
The correlation coefficients can also be used to determine which function provides

Caution
When you use a graphing utility
to find a logarithmic model,
remember that the domain of
is the set of posi-
tive numbers. Thus zero must not
be used as an x value of a data
point. This is the reason we have
used x = 1 to represent 1964 in
Example 3.

the better fit. For decreasing functions, the function
with correlation coefficient closest to 
provides
the better fit.
Notice that the graph of the logarithmic function
has the desired behavior to the right of the scatter
plot. That is, it is a gradually decreasing curve, and
this is the general behavior we would expect for
future winning times in the 100-meter freestyle event.
The graph of the exponential function is almost linear
and is decreasing at a rapid pace, which is not what
we would expect for results in an established
Olympic event. See Figure 4.53. Thus we select the
logarithmic function as our modeling function.
To predict the winning time for this event in
2016 (represented by 
), substitute 14 for in
the equation of the logarithmic function or use the
VALUE command in the CALCULATE menu to
produce the approximate time of 52.99 seconds, as
shown in Figure 4.54.

Finding a Logistic Growth Model
If a scatter plot of a set of data suggests that the data can be effectively modeled by a logis-
tic growth model, then you can use the Logistic feature of a graphing utility to find the
logistic growth model. This process is illustrated in Example 4.
EXAMPLE 4
Find a Logistic Growth Model
Table 4.15 shows the population of deer in an animal preserve for 1994 to 2008.
Table 4.15 Deer Population at an Animal Preserve
Find a logistic model that approximates the deer population as a function of the year.
Use the model to predict the deer population in 2014.
Solution
1. Construct a scatter plot of the data
Enter the data into a graphing utility, and
then use the utility to display a scatter plot of the data. In this example, we
represent 1994 by 
2008 by 
and the deer population by y.

growth model.

A TI-83/TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus calculator does not compute the
coefficient of determination or the correlation coefficient for a logistic model.
However, Figure 4.57 shows that the logistic model provides a good fit to the data.
To use the model to predict the deer population in 2014, note that the year 2014 is
represented by an x value of 20. Find the y value of the logistic function for 
The VALUE command in the CALCULATE menu shows that the logistic model

Table 4.16
Using a Semilog Graph to Model Exponential Decay
Consider the data in Table 4.16, which shows the viscosity V of SAE 40 motor oil
at various temperatures T in degrees Fahrenheit. The graph of these data is shown
in Figure 4.59 on page 417, along with a curve that passes through the points. The
graph appears to have the shape of an exponential decay model.
One way to determine whether the graph in Figure 4.59 is the graph of an expo-
nential function is to plot the data on semilog graph paper. On this graph paper, the
horizontal axis remains the same, but the vertical axis uses a logarithmic scale.
The data in Table 4.16 are graphed again in Figure 4.60, but this time the vertical
axis is a natural logarithm axis. This graph is approximately a straight line.
What is the significance of the fact that the correlation coeffi-
cient for the regression equation is 
?
37.
Duplicate Data Points An engineer needs to model the
data in set A with an exponential function.
Because the ordered pair 
is listed twice, the engineer
decides to eliminate one of these ordered pairs and model the
data in set B.
Determine whether A and B both have the same exponential
regression function.
38.
Domain Error A scientist needs to model the data
in set A.
The scientist views a scatter plot of the data and decides
to model the data with a logarithmic function of the form
a. When the scientist attempts to use a graphing calculator to
determine the logarithmic regression equation, the calcula-
tor displays the message
“ERR:DOMAIN”
Explain why the calculator was unable to determine the log-
arithmic regression equation for the data.

Power Functions A function that can be written in the
form 
is said to be a power function. Some data
sets can best be modeled by a power function. On a TI-83/
TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus calculator, the PwrReg instruction is
used to produce a power regression function for a set of data.
a. Find an exponential regression function and a power regres-
sion function for the following data. State the correlation
coefficient r for each model.
b. Which of the two regression functions provides the better
fit for the data?

Period of a Pendulum The following table shows the
time t (in seconds) of the period of a pendulum of length
l (in feet). (Note: The period of a pendulum is the time it takes
the pendulum to complete a swing from the right to the left

a. Determine the equation of the best model for the data. Your
model must be a power function or an exponential function.

Applications of Trigonometric Functions
In this chapter we introduce an important group of functions called
trigonometric functions. These functions are often used in applications
involving relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles. 
In Exercise 71 on page 453, right triangles and trigonometric functions 
are used to find the height and length of the skybridge between the
Petronas Towers.
In the seventeenth century, a unit circle approach was used to create
trigonometric functions of real numbers, which are also referred to as
circular functions. These functions allow us to solve a wider variety of
applications. For instance, in Exercise 63 page 480, a circular function is
used to model a sound wave and find the frequency of the sound wave.

Angles and Arcs
A point P on a line separates the line into two parts, each of which is called a half-line.
The union of point P and the half-line formed by P that includes point A is called a ray,
and it is represented as 
The point P is the endpoint of ray 
Figure 5.1 shows the ray
and a second ray represented as 
In geometry, an angle is defined simply as the union of two rays that have a common
endpoint. In trigonometry and many advanced mathematics courses, it is beneficial to
define an angle in terms of a rotation.

Definition of an Angle
An angle is formed by rotating a given ray about its endpoint to some terminal
position. The original ray is the initial side of the angle, and the second ray is the
terminal side of the angle. The common endpoint is the vertex of the angle.
There are several methods used to name an angle. One way is to employ Greek letters.
For example, the angle shown in Figure 5.2 can be designated as 
or as 
It also can
be named 
or 
If you name an angle by using three points, such as
it is traditional to list the vertex point between the other two points.
Angles formed by a counterclockwise rotation are considered positive angles, and
angles formed by a clockwise rotation are considered negative angles. See Figure 5.3.
Figure 5.3
Degree Measure
The measure of an angle is determined by the amount of rotation of the initial side. An
angle formed by rotating the initial side counterclockwise exactly once until it coincides
with itself (one complete revolution) is defined to have a measure of 360 degrees, which
can be written as 360°.

An angle superimposed in a Cartesian coordinate system is in standard position if its
vertex is at the origin and its initial side is on the positive x-axis. See Figure 5.8.
Two positive angles are complementary angles (Figure 5.9a) if the sum of the meas-
ures of the angles is 
Each angle is the complement of the other angle. Two positive
angles are supplementary angles (Figure 5.9b) if the sum of the measures of the angles

Question • Are the two acute angles of any right triangle complementary angles? Explain.
Some angles have a measure greater than 
See Figure 5.12a and Figure 5.12b.
The angle shown in Figure 5.12c has a measure less than 
because it is formed by
a clockwise rotation of more than one revolution of the initial side.
Figure 5.12
If the terminal side of an angle in standard position
lies on a coordinate axis, then the angle is classified as a
quadrantal angle. For example, the 
angle, the 
angle, and the 
angle shown in Figure 5.13 are all
quadrantal angles.
If the terminal side of an angle in standard position
does not lie on a coordinate axis, then the angle is classi-
fied according to the quadrant that contains the terminal
side. For example, 
in Figure 5.14 is a Quadrant III
angle.
Angles in standard position that have the same sides
are coterminal angles. Every angle has an unlimited
number of coterminal angles. Figure 5.15 shows 
and

Definition of Radian Measure
Given an arc of length s on a circle of radius r, the measure of the central angle 
subtended by the arc is 
radians.
u = s
r
As an example, consider that an arc with a length of 15 centimeters on a circle with a
radius of 5 centimeters subtends an angle of 3 radians, as shown in Figure 5.22. The same
result can be found by dividing 15 centimeters by 5 centimeters.
To find the measure in radians of any central angle 
divide the length s of the arc that
subtends by the length of the radius of the circle. Using the formula for radian measure,
we find that an arc with a length of 12 centimeters on a circle with a radius of 8 centimeters
subtends a central angle whose measure is
u = s

Note that the centimeter units are not part of the final result. The radian measure of a cen-
tral angle formed by an arc with a length of 12 miles on a circle with a radius of 8 miles 
would be the same, 
radians. If an angle has a measure of t radians, where t is a real
number, then the measure of the angle is often stated as t instead of t radians. For instance, if
an angle
has a measure of 2 radians, we can simply write
instead of
radians.
There will be no confusion concerning whether an angle measure is in degrees or radians,
because the degree symbol is always used for angle measurements that are in degrees.
Recall that the circumference of a circle is given by the equation 
The radian measure of the central angle 
subtended by the circumference is 
In degree measure, the central angle subtended by the circumference is 
Thus we have the relationship 
radians. Dividing each side of the equa-
tion by 2 gives 
radians. From this last equation, we can establish the following

Linear and Angular Speed
A ride at an amusement park has an inner ring of swings and an outer ring of swings.
During each complete revolution, the swings in the outer ring travel a greater distance than
the swings in the inner ring. We can say that the swings in the outer ring have a greater
linear speed than the swings in the inner ring. Interestingly, all of the swings complete the
same number of revolutions during any given ride. We say that all of the swings have the
same angular speed. In the following definitions,

(omega)
denotes angular speed.

(520 miles). Syrene was located directly south of Alexandria.
One summer, at noon, the sun was directly overhead at
Syrene, whereas at the same time in Alexandria, the sun was
at a 
angle from the zenith.
Eratosthenes reasoned that because the sun is far away, the rays
of sunlight that reach Earth must be nearly parallel. From this
assumption he concluded that the measure of

The Six Trigonometric Functions
The study of trigonometry, which means “triangle measurement,” began more than
2000 years ago, partially as a means of solving surveying problems. Early trigonometry
used the length of a line segment between two points of a circle as the value of a trigono-
metric function. In the sixteenth century, right triangles were used to define a trigonometric
function. We will use a modification of this approach.

Trigonometric Functions of Special Angles
In Example 1, the lengths of the legs of the triangle were given, and you were asked to find
the values of the six trigonometric functions of the angle 
Often we will want to find the
value of a trigonometric function when we are given the measure of an angle rather than
the measure of the sides of a triangle. For most angles, advanced mathematical methods
are required to evaluate a trigonometric function. For some special angles, however, the
value of a trigonometric function can be found by geometric methods. These special acute
angles are 
and 
First, we will find the values of the six trigonometric functions of

sion is based on angles measured in degrees. Radian measure could have been used
without changing the results.) Figure 5.33 shows a right triangle with angles

RIGHT TRIANGLE TRIGONOMETRY
The values of the trigonometric functions of the special angles 
and 
can be
found by drawing an equilateral triangle and bisecting one of the angles, as Figure 5.34
shows. The angle bisector also bisects one of the sides. Thus the length of the side oppo-
site the 
angle is one-half the length of the hypotenuse of triangle 
Let a denote the length of the hypotenuse. Then the length of the side opposite the
angle is 
The length of the side adjacent to the 
angle, h, is found by using the
Pythagorean Theorem.

RIGHT TRIANGLE TRIGONOMETRY
Applications Involving Right Triangles
Some applications concern an observer looking at an object. In these applications, angles
of elevation or angles of depression are formed by a line of sight and a horizontal line. If
the object being observed is above the observer, the acute angle formed by the line of sight
and the horizontal line is an angle of elevation. If the object being observed is below the
observer, the acute angle formed by the line of sight and the horizontal line is an angle of
depression. See Figure 5.37.

The values of the trigonometric functions of the special angles 30°, 45°, and 60°
shown in Table 5.2 are exact values. If an angle is not one of these special angles,
then a graphing calculator often is used to approximate the value of a trigonometric
function. For instance, to find sin 52.4° on a TI-83/TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus calculator,
first check that the calculator is in degree mode. Then use the sine function key 
to key in sin(52.4) and press 
. See Figure 5.35.
To find sec 1.25, first check that the calculator is in radian mode. A TI-83/TI-83
Plus/TI-84 Plus calculator does not have a secant function key, but because the secant
function is the reciprocal of the cosine function, we can evaluate sec 1.25 by evaluating
1/(cos 1.25). See Figure 5.36.

Trigonometric Functions of Any Angle
The applications of trigonometry would be quite limited if all angles had to be acute angles.
Fortunately, this is not the case. In this section we extend the definition of a trigonometric
function to include any angle.
Consider angle in Figure 5.41 in standard position and a point 
on the termi-
nal side of the angle. We define the trigonometric functions of any angle according to the
following definitions.

TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS OF ANY ANGLE
The value of a trigonometric function is independent of the point chosen on the termi-
nal side of the angle. Consider any two points on the terminal side of an angle 
in stan-
dard position, as shown in Figure 5.42. The right triangles formed are similar triangles, so 
the ratios of the corresponding sides are equal. Thus, for example, 
Because
we have 
Therefore, the value of the tangent function is 
independent of the point chosen on the terminal side of the angle. By a similar argument,
we can show that the value of any trigonometric function is independent of the point cho-
sen on the terminal side of the angle.
Any point in a rectangular coordinate system (except the origin) can determine an angle
in standard position. For example, 
in Figure 5.43 is a point in the second quadrant 
and determines an angle in standard position with

trigonometric function.

Signs of Trigonometric Functions
The sign of a trigonometric function depends on the quadrant in which the terminal side
of the angle lies. For example, if is an angle whose terminal side lies in Quadrant III and
is on the terminal side of 
then both x and y are negative, and therefore 
and 
are positive. See Figure 5.46. Because

The Wrapping Function
In the seventeenth century, applications of trigonometry were extended to problems in
physics and engineering. These kinds of problems required trigonometric functions whose
domains were sets of real numbers rather than sets of angles. This extension of the defini-
tions of trigonometric functions to include real numbers was accomplished by using a cor-
respondence between an angle and the length of an arc on a unit circle.
Consider a circle given by the equation 
called a unit circle, and a verti-
cal coordinate line l tangent to the unit circle at 
We define a function W that pairs a
real number t on the coordinate line with a point 
on the unit circle. This function W
is called the wrapping function because it is analogous to wrapping a line around a circle.
As shown in Figure 5.53, the positive part of the coordinate line is wrapped around
the unit circle in a counterclockwise direction. The negative part of the coordinate line is
wrapped around the circle in a clockwise direction.
The wrapping function is defined by the equation
where t is a real number and
is the point on the unit circle that corre-
sponds to t.
Through the wrapping function, each real num-
ber t defines an arc ¬
AP that subtends a central angle
with a measure of radians. The length of the arc ¬
AP
is t (see Figure 5.54). From the equation 
for
the arc length of a circle, we have (with 
)
For a unit circle, 
, and the equation becomes
Thus, on a unit circle, the measure of a cen-
tral angle and the length of its arc can be
represented by the same real number t.

Trigonometric functions of real numbers are frequently called circular functions to distin-
guish them from trigonometric functions of angles.
The trigonometric functions of real numbers look remarkably like the trigonometric
functions defined in the last section. The difference between the two is that of domain: In
one case, the domains are sets of real numbers; in the other case, the domains are sets of
angle measurements. However, there are similarities between the two functions.
Consider an angle 
(measured in radians) in standard position, as shown in 
Figure 5.58. Let 
and 
be two points on the terminal side of 
where 
and 
Let t be the length of the arc from 
to
Then
Thus the value of the sine function of 
measured in radians, is equal to the value of
the sine of the real number t. Similar arguments can be given to show corresponding results
for the other five trigonometric functions. With this in mind, we can assert that the value
of a trigonometric function at the real number t is its value at an angle of t radians.

TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS OF REAL NUMBERS
Properties of Trigonometric Functions of Real Numbers
The domain and range of the trigonometric functions of real numbers can be found from the
definitions of these functions. If t is any real number and 
is the point corresponding
to 
then by definition 
and 
Thus the domain of the sine and cosine
functions is the set of real numbers.
Because the radius of the unit circle is 1, we have
and
Therefore, with

and
The range of the cosine and sine functions is 
Using the definitions of tangent and secant,
and
The domain of the tangent function is all real numbers t except those for which the 
x-coordinate of 
is zero. The x-coordinate is zero when 
and in general when 
where n is an integer. Thus the domain of the tangent
function is the set of all real numbers t except 
where n is an integer. The 
range of the tangent function is all real numbers.
Similar methods can be used to find the domain and range of the cotangent, secant,
and cosecant functions. The results are summarized in Table 5.6.

TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS OF REAL NUMBERS
We encounter many recurring patterns in everyday life. For instance, the time of day
repeats every 24 hours. If 
represents the present time of day, then 24 hours later the
time of day will be exactly the same. Using mathematical notation, we can express this
concept as
The function is said to be periodic in that it continually repeats itself. The period of is
24 hours, the time it takes to complete one full cycle.

Definition of a Periodic Function
A function f is periodic if there exists a positive constant p such that
for all t in the domain of f. The smallest such positive number p for which f is peri-
odic is called the period of f.
f1t + p2 = f1t2
The unit circle can be used to show that the sine and cosine functions are periodic
functions. First, note that the circumference of the unit circle is 
. Thus, if we start at any
point
on the unit circle and travel a distance of 
units around
the circumference, we will be back at point P. Hence, 
equals

the second components yields

Trigonometric Identities
Recall that any equation that is true for every number in the domain of the equation is an
identity. The statement
is an identity because the two expressions produce the same result for all values of t for
which both functions are defined.
The ratio identities are obtained by writing the tangent and cotangent functions in
terms of the sine and cosine functions.

Find an Equation of a Graph
The graph at the right shows one cycle of the graph
of a sine or cosine function. Find an equation for the
graph.
Solution
Because the graph obtains its maximum value at
start with an equation of the form 
.
The graph completes one cycle in 6 units. Thus the 
period is 6. Use the equation 
to determine b.
• Multiply each side by

• Divide each side by 6.
We can use either 
as the b value. The graph has a maximum height of

The procedure for graphing 
is analogous to the procedure used to graph
cosecant functions. First, graph 
to determine its x-intercepts and its maximum
and minimum points.
The vertical asymptotes of the graph of the secant function pass through the x-intercepts
of the graph of the cosine function.
The maximum values of the cosine function are the relative minimum values of the
secant function, and the minimum values of the cosine function are the relative
maximum values of the secant function.
Figure 5.88 shows one cycle of the graph of 
for both a and b positive.

Addition of Ordinates
Given two functions g and h, the sum of the functions is the function f defined by
The graph of the sum f can be obtained by graphing g and h sepa-
rately and then geometrically adding the y-coordinates of each function for a given value
of x. It is convenient, when we are drawing the graph of the sum of two functions, to pick
zeros of the functions.
f1x2 = g1x2 + h1x2.

HARMONIC MOTION—AN APPLICATION OF THE SINE AND COSINE FUNCTIONS
The vibratory motion of a mass on a spring is called harmonic motion. In this section, we
will examine two types of harmonic motion.
Simple Harmonic Motion
We will consider a mass on a spring to illustrate vibratory motion. Assume that we have
placed a mass on a spring and allowed the spring to come to rest, as shown in Figure 5.99.
The system is said to be in equilibrium when the mass is at rest. The point of rest is called
the origin of the system. We consider the distance above the equilibrium point as positive
and the distance below the equilibrium point as negative.
If the mass is now lifted a distance a and released, the mass will oscillate up and down
in periodic motion. If there is no friction, the motion repeats itself in a certain period of
time. The number of times the mass oscillates in 1 unit of time is the frequency f of the
motion, and the time one oscillation takes is the period p of the motion. The motion is
referred to as simple harmonic motion. Figure 5.100 shows the displacement y of the 
mass for one oscillation at times 
and p.
Figure 5.100
The frequency and the period are related by the formulas
and
The maximum displacement from the equilibrium position is called the amplitude
of the motion. Vibratory motion can be quite complicated. However, the simple harmonic
motion of a mass on a spring can be described by one of the following equations.

the period, y is the displacement, and t is the time.

Question • A simple harmonic motion has a frequency of 2 cycles per second. What is the period

Answer •

Study tip
Function (1) is used if the dis-
placement from the origin is at 
a maximum at time t  0.
Function (2) is used if the dis-
placement at time t  0 is zero.

From physical laws determined by experiment, the frequency of oscillation of a mass
on a spring is given by
where k is a spring constant determined by experiment and m is the mass. The simple har-
monic motion of the mass on the spring (with maximum displacement at 
) can then
be described by

HARMONIC MOTION—AN APPLICATION OF THE SINE AND COSINE FUNCTIONS
Damped Harmonic Motion
The previous examples have assumed that there is no friction within the spring and no air
resistance. If we consider friction and air resistance, then the motion of the mass tends to
decrease as t increases. The motion is called damped harmonic motion and can be modeled
by an equation in the form f(t) = ae-ktcos vt.

Touch-Tone Phones and Trigonometry 
The dial tone emitted by a telephone is produced by adding a 350-hertz (cycles
per second) sound to a 440-hertz sound. A function that models the dial tone is 
where t is the time in seconds. Concepts from this chapter can be used to
show that the dial tone can also be modeled by
The equation
is called an identity because the left side of the equation equals the right
side for all domain values t.
Every tone made on a touch-tone phone is produced by adding a pair 
of sounds. The photo above shows the frequencies used for each numerical
key. For instance, the sound emitted by pressing 3 on the keypad is
produced by adding a 1477-hertz sound to a 697-hertz sound. A function
that models this tone is

Verification of Trigonometric Identities
To verify an identity, we show that one side of the identity can be rewritten in an equiva-
lent form that is identical to the other side. There is no one method that can be used to
verify every identity; however, the following guidelines should prove useful.
Guidelines for Verifying Trigonometric Identities
If one side of the identity is more complex than the other, then it is generally
best to try first to simplify the more complex side until it becomes identical to
the other side.
Perform indicated operations such as adding fractions or squaring a binomial.
Also be aware of any factorization that may help you to achieve your goal of
producing the expression on the other side.
Use previously established identities that enable you to rewrite one side of the
identity in an equivalent form.
Rewrite one side of the identity so that it involves only sines and/or cosines.
Rewrite one side of the identity in terms of a single trigonometric function.
Multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by the same
factor (such as the conjugate of the denominator or the conjugate of the numerator)
may get you closer to your goal.

6.1
VERIFICATION OF TRIGONOMETRIC IDENTITIES
In Example 1, we verify an identity by rewriting the more complicated side so that it
involves only sines and cosines.
Keep your goal in mind. Does it involve products, quotients, sums, radicals, or
powers? Knowing exactly what your goal is may provide the insight you need 
to verify the identity.
EXAMPLE 1
Change to Sines and Cosines to Verify an Identity

Solution
The left side of the identity is more complicated than the right side. We will try to ver-
ify the identity by rewriting the left side so that it involves only sines and cosines.
We have rewritten the left side of the equation so that it is identical to the right
side. Thus we have verified that the equation is an identity.

The left side of the identity is more complicated than the right side. We will try to

We have rewritten the left side of the equation so that it is identical to the right
side. Thus we have verified that the equation is an identity.
Try Exercise 44, page 521
In the previous examples, we verified trigonometric identities by rewriting one side
of the identity in equivalent forms until that side appeared identical to the other side. A
second method is to work with each side separately to produce a trigonometric expres-
sion that is equivalent to both sides. In the following paragraphs, we use this procedure
to verify the identity

• Use the identity 
• The common denominator for
the terms in the numerator is
cos x. Rewrite the numerator 
so that each term has a deno-
minator of cos x.
• Add the terms in the 
numerator.
• Rewrite the complex fraction 
as a division.
• Invert and multiply.
• Factor.
• Simplify.
• Use the identity sin x
cos x = tan x.
tan x = sin x

• Multiply both the numerator and the
denominator by the conjugate of 
the denominator.
• Multiply and rewrite as a single
fraction.

When you reach a point at which you are unsure how to proceed, stop and see what
results can be obtained by working with the other side.
(4) • Square the binomial.

(6)
At this point, we have verified the identity because we have shown that each side is
equal to the same trigonometric expression. It is worth noting that if we arranged the pre-
ceding equations in the order (1), (2), (3), (5), and (4), we would have a verification that
starts with the left side of the original identity and produces the right side.
When we verify an identity, we are not allowed to perform the same mathematical
operation on both sides of the equation because this can lead to an incorrect result. For
instance, consider the equation 
which is not an identity. If we square both
sides of the equation, we produce the identity 
We can avoid the problem
of converting a nonidentity into an identity, and vice versa, by using only mathematical
operations and procedures that are reversible. We can see that the operation of squaring is
not a reversible operation because it is not possible to take square roots (reverse the squar-
ing operation) and convert 
back into 
There is often more than one way to verify a trigonometric identity. Some of these
approaches are shorter and considered more elegant than others. As a beginner, you
should be content with finding a verification. After you have had lots of practice, you may
decide to seek out different verifications and compare them to see which you think is
most efficient.

SUM, DIFFERENCE, AND COFUNCTION IDENTITIES
Proof
To establish the identity for 
, we use the unit circle shown in Figure 6.2. The
angles 
and 
are drawn in standard position, with OA and OB as the terminal sides of 
and , respectively. The coordinates of A are
and the coordinates of B are
. The angle 
is formed by the terminal sides of the angles 
and 
(angle AOB).
Figure 6.2
An angle equal in measure to angle 
is placed in standard position in the same
figure (angle COD). From geometry, if two central angles of a circle have the same meas-
ure, then their chords are also equal in measure. Thus the chords AB and CD are equal in
length. Using the distance formula, we can calculate the lengths of the chords AB and CD.
Because

SUM, DIFFERENCE, AND COFUNCTION IDENTITIES
To verify that the sine function and the cosine function are cofunctions, we use the
identity for

which gives
Thus the sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complement. Using
with 
, we have
Therefore,
We can use the ratio identities to show that the tangent and cotangent functions are 
cofunctions.
The secant and cosecant functions are also cofunctions.

cos190° - u2
sin190° - u2 = sin u
cos u = tan u
 tan190° - u2 =
sin190° - u2
cos190° - u2 = cos u
sin u = cot u
cos a = sin190° - a2
cos a = cos390° - 190° - a24 = sin190° - a2
b = 90° - a
cos190° - b2 = sin b
cos190° - b2 = sin b

Study tip
To visualize the cofunction identi-
ties, consider the right triangle
shown in the following figure.
If 
is the degree measure of one
of the acute angles, then the
degree measure of the other
acute angle is 
. Using
the definitions of the trigono-

91. Mach Numbers Ernst Mach (1838–1916) was an Austrian
physicist who made a study of the motion of objects at high
speeds. Today we often state the speed of aircraft in terms of
a Mach number. A Mach number is the speed of an object
divided by the speed of sound. For example, a plane flying at
the speed of sound is said to have a speed M of Mach 1. Mach 2
is twice the speed of sound. An airplane that travels faster than
the speed of sound creates a sonic boom. This sonic boom
emanates from the airplane in the shape of a cone.
The following equation shows the relationship between the
measure of the cone’s vertex angle 
and the Mach speed M of
an aircraft that is flying faster than the speed of sound.

Inverse Trigonometric Functions
Because the graph of 
fails the horizontal line test, it is not the graph of a one-to-
one function. Therefore, it does not have an inverse function. Figure 6.10 shows the graph
of 
on the interval 
and the graph of the inverse relation
. Note that the graph of 
does not satisfy the vertical line test and there-
fore is not the graph of a function.
Figure 6.10
If the domain of the function 
is restricted to 
, the graph of
satisfies the horizontal line test; therefore, the function has an inverse function.
The graphs of 
for 
and its inverse are shown in Figure 6.11.
To find the inverse of the function defined by

• Interchange x and y.
• Solve for y.
Unfortunately, there is no algebraic solution for y. Thus we establish new notation and write
which is read “y is the inverse sine of x.” Some textbooks use the notation 
arcsin x instead of

Inverse Functions
See Section 4.1.

It is convenient to think of the value of an inverse trigonometric function as an angle.
For instance, if 
, then y is the angle in the interval 
whose sine is
Thus
Because the graph of 
fails the horizontal line test, it is not the graph of a
one-to-one function. Therefore, it does not have an inverse function. Figure 6.12 shows the
graph of 
on the interval 
and the graph of the inverse relation
. Note that the graph of 
does not satisfy the vertical line test and there-
fore is not the graph of a function.
Figure 6.12
If the domain of 
is restricted to 
, the graph of 
satis-
fies the horizontal line test and therefore is the graph of a one-to-one function. The graphs
of 
for 
and its inverse are shown in Figure 6.13.
To find the inverse of the function defined by 
, with 
, inter-
change x and y. Then solve for y.
•
• Interchange x and y.
• Solve for y.
As in the case for the inverse sine function, there is no algebraic solution for y. Thus the
notation for the inverse cosine function becomes 
. We can write the following
definition of the inverse cosine function.
y = cos-1 x

Because the graphs of 
, 
, 
, and 
fail the horizon-
tal line test, these functions are not one-to-one functions. Therefore, these functions do not
have inverse functions. If the domains of all these functions are restricted in a certain way,
however, the graphs satisfy the horizontal line test. Thus each of these functions has an
inverse function over a restricted domain. Table 6.2 on page 551 shows the restricted func-
tion and the inverse function for

Answer • Two.
Squaring both sides of an equation may not produce an equivalent equation. Thus,
when this method is used, the proposed solutions must be checked to eliminate any extra-
neous solutions.

What is the maximum horizontal range for a projectile that has an initial velocity
of 474 feet per second?

Method 1
The following solutions were obtained by using a graphing utility to

See Figure 6.28. Thus there are two angles 
for which the projectile will hit the target. To the nearest thousandth of a degree, they are
It should be noted that the graph in Figure 6.28 is not a graph of the path of the

To solve algebraically, we proceed as follows. Multiply each side of
Equation (1) by 16 and divide by

Modeling Sinusoidal Data
Data that can be closely modeled by a function of the form 
are
called sinusoidal data. Many graphing utilities are designed to perform a sine regression
to find the sine function that provides the best least-squares fit for sinusoidal data. For
instance, the TI-83/TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus calculators use the command SinReg and the
TI-86 calculator uses SinR to perform a sine regression. The process generally works best
for those sets of data for which we have a good estimate of the period.
In Example 8, we use a sine regression to model the percent of illumination of the
moon as seen from Earth. See Figure 6.30.

How to Construct a Scatter
Plot
See Section 2.7.
A sine regression requires at
least four data points. The itera-
tions number 16 in Figure 6.33,
the maximum number of times
the SinReg command will iter-
ate to find a regression equa-
tion. Any integer from 1 to 16
can be used; however, the inte-
ger 16 generally produces more
accurate results than do smaller
integers.
to estimate the percent of the moon illuminated at midnight EST on September 12, 2012.
(Note: The illumination cycle of the moon has a period of about 29.53 days. The percent
of the moon illuminated is nearly the same regardless of one’s position on Earth.) 
Solution
1. Construct a scatter plot of the data. Enter the data from Table 6.3 into your
graphing utility. See Figure 6.31. The sinusoidal nature of the scatter plot in 
Figure 6.32 indicates that the data can be closely modeled by a sine function.
Figure 6.31
Figure 6.32
2. Find the regression function. On a TI-83/TI-83 Plus/TI-84 Plus graphing calculator,
the input shown in Figure 6.33 produces the sine regression shown in Figure 6.34. 
Figure 6.33
Figure 6.34
The regression function is given by:
3. Examine the fit, and use the regression function to make a prediction. The SinReg
command does not yield a correlation coefficient. However, a graph of the regression
function and the scatter plot of the data shows that the regression function provides a
good model of the data. See Figure 6.35. Use the value command in the CALC menu
to show that the percent of the moon illuminated at midnight (EST) on September 12,
2012 (x  43), will be 14%, rounded to the nearest percent. See Figure 6.36.

CHAPTER 6 TEST PREP
The following test prep table summarizes essential concepts in this chapter. The references given in the right-hand
column list Examples and Exercises that can be used to test your understanding of a concept.
6.1 Verification of Trigonometric Identities
Guidelines for Verifying Trigonometric Identities
• If one side of the identity is more complex than the other, then it is 
generally best to try to simplify the more complex side.
• Perform indicated operations such as adding fractions or squaring a 
binomial. Also be aware of any factorization that may help you 
achieve your goal.
• Use previously established identities that enable you to rewrite one 
side of the identity in an equivalent form.
• Rewrite one side of the identity so that it involves only sines and/or 
cosines.
• Rewrite one side of the identity in terms of a single trigonometric 
function.
• Multiply both the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by the

Solve Trigonometric Equations
Algebraic methods and identities are used to solve many trigonometric 
equations. If solutions cannot be found by algebraic methods, then we 
often use a graphing utility to find approximate solutions.
Model Sinusoidal Data
Data that can be closely modeled by a function of the form 
are called sinusoidal data. Graphing utilities can 
be used to perform a sine regression to find the sine function that 
provides the best least-squares fit for sinusoidal data.

CHAPTER 7
Trigonometry and Indirect Measurement
In Chapter 5, we used trigonometric functions to find the unknown length
of a side of a given right triangle. In this chapter, we develop theorems that
can be used to find the length of a side or the measure of an angle of any
triangle, even if it is not a right triangle. These theorems are often used
in the areas of navigation, surveying, and building design. Meterologists
use these theorems to estimate the distance from an approaching hurricane
to cities in the projected path of the hurricane. For instance, in the diagram
above, the distance from the hurricane to Nags Head can be determined
using the Law of Sines, a theorem presented in this chapter.
See Exercises 30 and 31 on page 589 for additional applications that can
be solved by using the Law of Sines.

Law of Sines
Solving a triangle involves finding the lengths of all sides and the measures of all angles
in the triangle. In this section and the next, we develop formulas for solving an oblique
triangle, which is a triangle that does not contain a right angle. The Law of Sines can be
used to solve oblique triangles in which either two angles and a side or two sides and an
angle opposite one of the sides are known. In Figure 7.1, altitude CD is drawn from C. The
length of the altitude is h. Triangles ACD and BCD are right triangles.
Using the definition of the sine of an angle of a right triangle, we have from Figure 7.1
Equating the values of h in these equations, we obtain
Dividing each side of the equation by 
, we obtain
Similarly, when an altitude is drawn to a different side, the following formulas result.

7.1
LAW OF SINES
Ambiguous Case (SSA)
When you are given two sides of a triangle and an angle opposite one of them, you may
find that the triangle is not unique. Some information may result in two triangles, and some
may result in no triangle. It is because of this that the case of knowing two sides and an
angle opposite one of them (SSA) is called the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines.
Suppose that sides a and c and the nonincluded angle A of a triangle are known and
we are asked to solve triangle ABC. The relationships among h, the height of the triangle,
a (the side opposite 
), and c determine whether there are no, one, or two triangles.
Case 1
First consider the case in which 
is an acute angle (see Figure 7.3). There
are four possible situations.
1.
; there is no possible triangle.
2.
; there is one triangle, a right triangle.
3.
; there are two possible triangles.
4.
; there is one triangle, which is not a right triangle.

We have used the rounding

to determine the number of

Use the Law of Sines to find a.
• A  42°, c  18, C  75°
Use the Law of Sines again, this time to find b.
• B  63°, c  18, C  75°
The solution is
and

Solution
Use the Law of Sines to find the measure of angle B.
• The Law of Sines
• a  34.5, A  32.2°, b  21.3
• Solve for sin B.
There are two angles B, where B is between 0° and 180°, such that 
.
One of the angles is an acute angle, and the other is an obtuse angle. The inverse sine
function can be used to find the acute angle. 
The obtuse angle is the supplement of 19.2°, which is 
. We can
determine that the 160.8° value for B is not a valid result, because 
and the
sum of 32.2° and 160.8° is greater than 180°. (The sum of the measures of the angles
in any triangle is 180°.) Thus the only possibility for B is

mate the measure of angle C.

In navigation and surveying problems, there are two commonly used methods for
specifying direction. The angular direction in which a craft is pointed is called the head-
ing. Heading is expressed in terms of an angle measured clockwise from north. Figure 7.8
shows a heading of 65° and a heading of 285°.
The angular direction used to locate one object in relation to another object is called
the bearing. Bearing is expressed in terms of the acute angle formed by a north–south
line and the line of direction. Figure 7.9 shows a bearing of N38°W and a bearing of
S15°E.

Use the Law of Cosines first to find b and then to find A.
• Substitute for a, c, and B.
• Solve the Law of Cosines 
for cos A.
The bearing of the present position of the boat from the starting point A can be deter-
mined by calculating the measure of angle a in Figure 7.13, on page 593.

Choosing Between the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines
Apply the Law of Sines to solve an oblique triangle for each of the following cases.
ASA
The measures of two angles of the triangle and the length of the
included side are known.
AAS
The measures of two angles of the triangle and the length of a side
opposite one of these angles are known.
SSA
The lengths of two sides of the triangle and the measure of an angle
opposite one of these sides are known. This case is called the ambigu-
ous case. It may yield one solution, two solutions, or no solution.
Apply the Law of Cosines to solve an oblique triangle for each of the following cases.
SSS
The lengths of all three sides of the triangle are known. After find-
ing the measure of an angle, you can complete your solution by
using the Law of Sines.
SAS
The lengths of two sides of the triangle and the measure of the
included angle are known. After finding the measure of the third
side, you can complete your solution by using the Law of Sines.
Question • In triangle ABC,
and 
Should you use the Law of Sines
or the Law of Cosines to solve this triangle?
b = 114.
C = 60°,
A = 40°,
Answer • Because the measure of two angles and the length of the included side are given, the
triangle can be solved by using the Law of Sines.

The measure of angle A in
Example 3 can also be
determined by using the Law 
of Sines.

LAW OF COSINES AND AREA
Study tip
Because each formula requires 
two sides and the included angle, 
it is necessary to learn only one
formula.
Area of a Triangle
The formula 
can be used to find the area of a triangle when the base and height
are given. In this section we will find the areas of triangles when the height is not given.
We will use K for the area of a triangle because the letter A is often used to represent the
measure of an angle.
Consider the areas of the acute and obtuse triangles in Figure 7.14.
Height of each triangle:
Area of each triangle:
• Substitute for h.
Thus we have established the following theorem.

Heron’s Formula
The Law of Cosines can be used to derive Heron’s formula for the area of a triangle in
which three sides of the triangle are given.
Heron’s Formula for Finding the Area of a Triangle
If a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, then the area K of the
triangle is
K = 2s1s - a21s - b21s - c2,
where s = 1
2 1a + b + c2
Because s is one-half the perimeter of the triangle, it is called the semiperimeter.
Math Matters
Recent findings indicate that
Heron’s formula for finding the
area of a triangle was first
discovered by Archimedes.
However, the formula is called
Heron’s formula in honor of the
geometer Heron of Alexandria
(A.D. 50), who gave an ingenious
proof of the theorem in his work
Metrica. Because Heron of
Alexandria was also known as
Hero, some texts refer to Heron’s
formula as Hero’s formula.

Use Heron’s Formula to Solve an Application
The original portion of the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas has the shape of a square
pyramid. Each face of the pyramid is an isosceles triangle with a base of 646 feet
and sides of length 576 feet. Assuming that the glass on the exterior of the Luxor Hotel
costs $35 per square foot, determine the cost of the glass, to the nearest $10,000, for
one of the triangular faces of the hotel.
Solution
The lengths (in feet) of the sides of a triangular face are 
and
The cost C of the glass is the product of the cost per square foot and the area.
The approximate cost of the glass for one face of the Luxor Hotel is $5,390,000.

The identity at the right is one 
of Mollweide’s formulas.
It applies to any triangle ABC.
The formula is intriguing because it contains the
dimensions of all angles and all sides of triangle ABC.
The formula can be used to check whether a triangle has
been solved correctly. Substitute the dimensions of a
given triangle into the formula and compare the value of
the left side of the formula with the value of the right
side. If the two results are not reasonably close, then you
know that at least one dimension is incorrect. The results
generally will not be identical because each dimension 
is an approximation. In Exercises 63 and 64, you can
assume that a triangle has an incorrect dimension if the
value of the left side and the value of the right side of
the above formula differ by more than 0.02.

In scientific applications, some measurements, such as area, mass, distance, speed,
and time, are completely described by a real number and a unit. Examples include
30 square feet (area), 
(speed), and 5 hours (time). These measure-
ments are called scalar quantities, and the number used to indicate the magnitude of
the measurement is called a scalar. Two other examples of scalar quantities are volume
and temperature.
For other quantities, in addition to the numerical and unit description, it is necessary
to include a direction to describe the quantity completely. For example, applying a force of
25 pounds at various angles to a small metal box will influence how the box moves. In
Figure 7.16, applying the 25-pound force straight down (A) will not move the box to the
left. However, applying the 25-pound force parallel to the floor (C) will move the box
along the floor.
Vector quantities have a magnitude (numerical and unit description) and a direction.
Force is a vector quantity. Velocity is another. Velocity includes the speed (magnitude) and
a direction. A velocity of 40 miles per hour east is different from a velocity of 40 miles per
hour north. Displacement is another vector quantity; it consists of distance (a scalar) moved
in a certain direction. For example, we might speak of a displacement of 13 centimeters at
an angle of 15° from the positive x-axis.

The point A for the vector in Figure 7.17 is called the initial point (or tail) of the vec-
tor, and the point B is the terminal point (or head) of the vector. An arrow over the letters
, an arrow over a single letter 
, or boldface type (AB or V) is used to denote a
vector. The magnitude of the vector is the length of the line segment and is denoted by
, 
, 
, or 
.
Equivalent vectors have the same magnitude and the same direction. The vectors in
Figure 7.18 are equivalent. They have the same magnitude and direction.
Multiplying a vector by a positive real number (other than 1) changes the magnitude
of the vector but not its direction. If v is any vector, then 2v is the vector that has the same
direction as v but is twice the magnitude of v. The multiplication of 2 and v is called
the scalar multiplication of the vector v and the scalar 2. Multiplying a vector by a negative
number a reverses the direction of the vector and multiplies the magnitude of the vector by
. See Figure 7.19.
The sum of two vectors, called the resultant vector or the resultant, is the single
equivalent vector that will have the same effect as the application of those two vectors. For
example, a displacement of 40 meters along the positive x-axis and then 30 meters in the
positive y direction is equivalent to a vector of magnitude 50 meters at an angle of approx-
imately 37° to the positive x-axis. See Figure 7.20.
Vectors can be added graphically by using the triangle method or the parallelogram
method. In the triangle method, shown in Figure 7.21, the initial point of V is placed at the
terminal point of U. The vector connecting the initial point of U with the terminal point of
V is the sum 
The parallelogram method of adding two vectors graphically places the initial point of
the two vectors U and V together, as in Figure 7.22. Complete the parallelogram so that U
and V are sides of the parallelogram. The diagonal beginning at the initial point of the two
vectors is 
To find the difference between two vectors, first rewrite the expression as
. The difference is shown geometrically in Figure 7.23.

By introducing a coordinate plane, it is possible to develop an analytic approach to vec-
tors. Recall from our discussion of equivalent vectors that a vector can be moved in the
plane as long as the magnitude and direction are not changed.
With this in mind, consider AB, whose initial point is 
and whose terminal
point is 
. If this vector is moved so that the initial point is at the origin O, the ter-
minal point becomes 
, as shown in Figure 7.24, on page 603. The vector OP is
equivalent to the vector AB.
In Figure 7.25, on page 603, let 
be the initial point of a vector and
its terminal point. Then an equivalent vector OP has its initial point at the ori-
gin and its terminal point at 
, where

Applications of Vectors
Vectors are used to solve applied problems in which forces are acting simultaneously on
an object. For instance, an airplane flying in a wind is being acted upon by the force of its
engine, F1, and the force of the wind, F2. The combined effect of these two forces is given
by the resultant F1  F2. In the following example, the airspeed of the plane is the speed
at which the plane would be moving if there were no wind. The actual velocity of the plane
is the plane’s velocity with respect to the ground. The magnitude of the plane’s actual
velocity is called its ground speed.

Study tip
Ground speed is the magnitude
of the resultant of the plane’s
velocity vector and the wind’s
velocity vector.

Solve an Application Involving Airspeed

wind of 42 miles per hour is blowing at a heading of 125°. Find the ground speed and
the course of the airplane.
Solution
Sketch a diagram similar to Figure 7.30 showing the relevant vectors. AB represents the
heading and the airspeed, AD represents the wind velocity, and AC represents the course
and the ground speed. 
By vector addition, AC  AB  AD. From the figure,
AC is the course of the plane. The ground speed is AC. The heading is

Many applied problems can be analyzed by resolving a vector into two vectors that are
perpendicular to each other. For instance, Figure 7.31 shows a car on a ramp. The force of
gravity on the car is shown by the downward vector w, which has been resolved into the vec-
tors F1 and F2. The vector F1 is parallel to the ramp and represents the force pushing the car
down the ramp. The vector F2 is perpendicular to the ramp and represents the force the car
exerts against the ramp. These two perpendicular forces F1 and F2 are vector components
of w. That is, w  F1  F2. The force needed to keep the car from rolling down the ramp
is F1. The angle formed by w and F2 is complementary to the 75.0° angle. Thus the angle
formed by w and F2 has a measure of 15.0°, which is the same as the angular measure of
the incline of the ramp.

Work: An Application of the Dot Product
When a 5-pound force is used to lift a box from the ground a distance of 4 feet, work
is done. The amount of work is the product of the force on the box and the distance the
box is moved. In this case the work is 20 foot-pounds. When the box is lifted, the force
and the displacement vector (the direction in which and the distance the box was
moved) are in the same direction. (See Figure 7.38.)
Now consider a sled being pulled by a child along the ground by a rope attached to
the sled, as shown in Figure 7.39. The force vector (along the rope) is not in the same direc-
tion as the displacement vector (parallel to the ground). In this case the dot product is used
to determine the work done by the force.

Math Matters
Abraham de Moivre (1667–1754)
was a French mathematician who
fled to England during the expul-
sion of the Huguenots in 1685.
De Moivre made important
contributions to probability theory
and analytic geometry. In 1718 he
published The Doctrine of Chance,
in which he developed the theory
of annuities, mortality statistics,
and the concept of statistical
independence. In 1730 de Moivre
stated the theorem shown above
Example 1, which we now call De
Moivre’s Theorem. This theorem
is significant because it provides a
connection between trigonometry
and mathematical analysis.
Although de Moivre was well
respected in the mathematical
community and was elected to
the Royal Society of England, he
never was able to secure a
university teaching position.
His income came mainly from
tutoring, and he died in poverty.
De Moivre is often remem-
bered for predicting the day of his
own death. At one point in his
life, he noticed that he was sleep-
ing a few minutes longer each
night. Thus he calculated that
he would die when he needed
24 hours of sleep. As it turned
out, his calculation was correct.

7.1 Law of Sines
Law of Sines
If A, B, and C are the measures of the angles of a triangle and a, b, and c
are the lengths of the sides opposite these angles, then
The Law of Sines can be used to solve triangles when two angles 
and a side are given or when two sides and an angle opposite 
one of them are given.
The Ambiguous Case (SSA)
The case in which you are given the lengths of two sides of a triangle and 
the measure of an angle opposite one of these sides (SSA) is called the 
ambiguous case. There may be two distinct triangles, one triangle, or no 
triangle with the given dimensions.

Conic Sections and Their Applications
In this chapter you will study special types of geometric figures known as
conic sections. Each of these figures is formed by the intersection of a
plane and a cone.
The ancient Greeks were the first to analyze these figures and their
properties. Their study was motivated by the many new and interesting
mathematical concepts they were able to discover, without regard to
finding or producing practical applications. The ancient Greeks would be
surprised to learn that their study of conic sections has helped produce a
body of knowledge with many practical applications, in several diverse
fields, such as astronomy, architecture, engineering, and satellite com-
munications. Exercise 55 on page 655 involves a medical application of 
conic sections, and Exercise 37 page 642 illustrates an application 
of conic sections in the design of mirrored solar collectors.

Parabolas
The graph of a circle, an ellipse, a parabola, or a hyperbola can be formed by the intersec-
tion of a plane and a cone. Hence, these figures are referred to as conic sections. See
Figure 8.1.
Cones intersected by planes
Figure 8.1
A plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone intersects the cone in a circle (plane C).
The plane E, tilted so that it is not perpendicular to the axis, intersects the cone in an
ellipse. When the plane is parallel to a line on the surface of the cone, the plane intersects
the cone in a parabola. When the plane intersects both portions of the cone, a hyperbola is
formed. If the intersection of a plane and a cone is a point, a line, or two intersecting lines,
then the intersection is called a degenerate conic section.
Parabolas with Vertex at (0, 0)
In addition to the geometric description of a conic section just given, a conic section can
be defined as a set of points. This method uses specified conditions about a curve to deter-
mine which points in the coordinate system are points of the graph. For example, a parabola
can be defined by the following set of points.

Definition of a Parabola
A parabola is the set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed line (the
directrix) and a fixed point (the focus) not on the directrix.
The line that passes through the focus and is perpendicular to the directrix is called the axis
of symmetry of the parabola. The midpoint of the line segment between the focus and the
directrix on the axis of symmetry is the vertex of the parabola, as shown in Figure 8.2.
Using this definition of a parabola, we can determine an equation of a parabola.
Suppose that the coordinates of the vertex of a parabola are 
and the axis of sym-
metry is the y-axis. The equation of the directrix is 
The focus lies on the
axis of symmetry and is the same distance from the vertex as the vertex is from the direc-
trix. Thus the coordinates of the focus are 
as shown in Figure 8.3.
Let 
be any point P on the parabola. Then, using the distance formula and
the fact that the distance between any point P on the parabola and the focus is equal to the

Now, squaring each side and simplifying, we get
This is the standard form of the equation of a parabola with vertex at the origin and
the 
axis as its axis of symmetry. The standard form of the equation of a parabola with
vertex at the origin and the x-axis as its axis of symmetry is derived in a similar manner.

PARABOLAS
Parabolas with Vertex at (h, k)
The equation of a parabola with a vertical or horizontal axis of symmetry and with vertex
at a point 
can be found by using the translations discussed previously. Consider
a coordinate system with coordinate axes labeled 
and 
placed so that its origin is at
of the xy-coordinate system.
The relationship between an ordered pair in the 
coordinate system and one in the
xy-coordinate system is given by the transformation equations
Now consider a parabola with vertex at 
as shown in Figure 8.7. Create a new co-
ordinate system with axes labeled 
and 
and with its origin at 
The equation of a
parabola in the 
coordinate system is
Using the transformation equations, we can substitute the expressions for 
and 
into the equation above. The standard form of the equation of a parabola with vertex 
and a vertical axis of symmetry is
Similarly, we can derive the standard form of the equation of a parabola with vertex
and a horizontal axis of symmetry.

PARABOLAS
Applications of Parabolas
A principle of physics states that when light is reflected from a point P on a surface,
the angle of incidence (that of the incoming ray) equals the angle of reflection (that of
the outgoing ray). See Figure 8.11. This principle applied to parabolas has some useful
consequences.
The coordinates of the focus are
The equation of the directrix is
Choosing some values for y and finding the corresponding values for x, we plot
a few points. Because the line 
is the axis of symmetry, for each point on one
side of the axis of symmetry there is a corresponding point on the other side. Two
points are

When a parabola is revolved about its axis, it produces a three-dimensional surface
called a paraboloid. The focus of a paraboloid is the same as the focus of the parabola
that was revolved to generate the paraboloid. The vertex of a paraboloid is the same as
the vertex of the parabola that was revolved to generate the paraboloid. In Example 5 we
find the focus of a satellite dish that has the shape of a paraboloid.

Reflective Property of a Parabola
The line tangent to a parabola at a point P makes equal angles with the line
through P and parallel to the axis of symmetry and the line through P and the
focus of the parabola (see Figure 8.12).
A cross section of the reflecting mirror of a telescope has the shape of a parabola. The
incoming parallel rays of light are reflected from the surface of the mirror to the eyepiece.
See Figure 8.13.
Flashlights and car headlights also use this reflective property. The lightbulb is posi-
tioned at the focus of the parabolic reflector, which causes the reflected light to be reflected
outward in parallel rays. See Figure 8.14.

EXAMPLE 5
Find the Focus of a Satellite Dish
A satellite dish has the shape of a paraboloid. The signals that it receives are 
reflected to a receiver that is located at the focus of the paraboloid. If the dish is 
8 feet across at its opening and 1.25 feet deep at its center, determine the location 
of its focus.
Solution
Figure 8.15 shows that a cross section of the paraboloid along its axis of symmetry 
is a parabola. Figure 8.16 on page 641 shows this cross section placed in a rectangular
coordinate system with the vertex of the parabola at 
and the axis of symmetry of
the parabola on the y-axis. The parabola has an equation of the form

An ellipse is another of the conic sections formed when a plane intersects a right circular
cone. If 
is the angle at which the plane intersects the axis of the cone and 
is the angle
shown in Figure 8.17, an ellipse is formed when 
If 
then a circle
is formed.

As was the case for a parabola, there is a definition for an ellipse in terms of a certain
set of points in the plane.

Definition of an Ellipse
An ellipse is the set of all points in the plane the sum of whose distances from two
fixed points (foci) is a positive constant.
Equipped only with a piece of string and two tacks, we can use this definition to draw
an ellipse (see Figure 8.18). Tack the ends of the string to the foci, and trace a curve with
a pencil held tight against the string. The resulting curve is an ellipse. The positive con-
stant mentioned in the definition of an ellipse is the length of the string.
Note
If a plane intersects a cone at
the vertex of the cone so that the
resulting figure is a point, the
point is called a degenerate
ellipse. See the accompanying
figure.

Ellipses with Center at (0, 0)
The graph of an ellipse has two axes of symmetry (see Figure 8.19). The longer axis is
called the major axis. The foci of the ellipse are on the major axis. The shorter axis
is called the minor axis. It is customary to denote the length of the major axis by 
and the length of the minor axis by 
The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the
major axis. The endpoints of the major axis are the vertices (plural of vertex) of the
ellipse.
A semimajor axis of an ellipse is a line segment that connects the center point of the
ellipse with a vertex. Its length is half the length of the major axis. A semiminor axis of
an ellipse is a line segment that lies on the minor axis and connects the center point with
a point on the ellipse. Its length is half the length of the minor axis.
Consider the point 
which is one vertex of an ellipse, and the points 
and 
which are the foci of the ellipse shown in Figure 8.20. The distance from
to 
is 
Similarly, the distance from 
to 
is 
From the definition of an
ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci is a positive
constant. By adding the expressions 
and 
we have
Thus the positive constant referred to in the definition of an ellipse is 
the length of the
major axis.
Now let 
be any point on the ellipse (see Figure 8.21). By using the definition
of an ellipse, we have
Subtract the second radical from each side of the equation, and then square each side of
the equation.
• Divide by -4, and 
then square each side.
• Rewrite with x and y
terms on the left side.

A graphing utility can be used to graph an ellipse. For instance, consider the equation
from Example 2. Rewrite the equation as
In this form, the equation is a quadratic equation in terms of the variable y with

The graph of Y1
is the part of the ellipse
on or above the line 
(see Figure 8.28).
The graph of Y2
is the part of the ellipse on

as shown in Figure 8.28.
One advantage of this graphing procedure 
is that it does not require us to write the given 
equation in standard form. A disadvantage of the 
graphing procedure is that it does not indicate

ELLIPSES
Eccentricity of an Ellipse
The graph of an ellipse can be long and thin, or it can be much like a circle. The eccen-
tricity of an ellipse is a measure of its “roundness.”
Eccentricity (e) of an Ellipse
The eccentricity e of an ellipse is the ratio of c to a, where c is the distance from the
center to a focus and a is one-half the length of the major axis. That is,
e = c
a
Study tip
Eccentric literally means “out of
the center.” Eccentricity is a mea-
sure of how much an ellipse is
unlike a set of points the same
distance from the center. The
higher the eccentricity, the more
unlike a circle the ellipse is, and
therefore, the longer and thinner
it is. A circle is also a conic section.
Its standard form is given on
page 162.
Each ellipse in Figure 8.30 has an eccentricity of 0.87.

Applications of Ellipses
The planets travel around the sun in elliptical orbits. The sun is located at a focus of
the orbit. The eccentricities of the orbits for the planets in our solar system are given
in Table 8.1.
Question • Which planet has the most nearly circular orbit?
The terms perihelion and aphelion are used to denote the position of a planet in its orbit
around the sun. The perihelion is the point nearest the sun; the aphelion is the point far-
thest from the sun. See Figure 8.32. The length of the semimajor axis of a planet’s ellipti-
cal orbit is called the mean distance of the planet from the sun.

Determine an Equation for the Orbit of Earth
Earth has a mean distance of 93 million miles and a perihelion distance of
91.5 million miles. Find an equation for Earth’s orbit.
Solution
A mean distance of 93 million miles implies that the length of the semi-major axis of
the orbit is 
million miles. Earth’s aphelion distance is the length of the major
axis less the length of the perihelion distance. Thus
Aphelion distance

ELLIPSES
Sound waves, although different from light waves, have a similar reflective property.
When sound is reflected from a point P on a surface, the angle of incidence equals the
angle of reflection. Applying this principle to a room with an elliptical ceiling results in
what are called whispering galleries. These galleries are based on the following theorem.
The distance c from the sun to the center of Earth’s orbit is
million miles
The length b of the semiminor axis of the orbit is

Reflective Property of an Ellipse
The lines from the foci to a point on an ellipse make equal angles with the tangent
line at that point. See Figure 8.33.
The reflective property of an ellipse can be used to show that sound waves, or light waves,
that emanate from one focus of an ellipse will be reflected to the other focus.
The Statuary Hall in the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., is a whispering gallery.
A person standing at one focus of the elliptical ceiling can whisper and be heard by a
person standing at the other focus. John Quincy Adams, while a member of the House of
Representatives, was aware of this acoustical phenomenon. He situated his desk at a focus
of the elliptical ceiling, which allowed him to eavesdrop on the conversations of his polit-
ical adversaries, who were located near the other focus.
EXAMPLE 6
Locate the Foci of a Whispering Gallery
A room 88 feet long is constructed to be a whispering gallery. The room has an ellipti-
cal ceiling, as shown in Figure 8.34. If the maximum height of the ceiling is 22 feet,
determine where the foci are located.
Solution
The length a of the semimajor axis of the elliptical ceiling is 44 feet. The height b of
the semiminor axis is 22 feet. Thus
The foci are located about 38.1 feet from the center of the elliptical ceiling, along its
major axis.

A hyperbola is a conic section formed when a plane intersects a right circular cone at a cer-
tain angle. If 
is the angle at which the plane intersects the axis of the cone and 
is the
angle shown in Figure 8.35, a hyperbola is formed when 0°
or when the plane is
parallel to the axis of the cone.
As with the other conic sections, there is a definition of a hyperbola in terms of a cer-
tain set of points in the plane.

Definition of a Hyperbola
A hyperbola is the set of all points in the plane the difference between whose
distances from two fixed points (foci) is a positive constant.

659
8.3
HYPERBOLAS
This definition differs from that of an ellipse in that the ellipse was defined in terms
of the sum of two distances, whereas the hyperbola is defined in terms of the difference of
two distances.
Hyperbolas with a Center at (0, 0)
The transverse axis of a hyperbola shown in Figure 8.36 is the line segment joining
the intercepts. The midpoint of the transverse axis is called the center of the hyperbola.
The conjugate axis is a line segment that passes through the center of the hyperbola and
is perpendicular to the transverse axis.
The length of the transverse axis is customarily represented as 
and the distance
between the two foci is represented as 
The length of the conjugate axis is represented
as
The vertices of a hyperbola are the points where the hyperbola intersects the trans-
verse axis.
To determine the positive constant stated in the definition of a hyperbola, consider the
point 
, which is one vertex of a hyperbola, and the points 
and 
which are the foci of the hyperbola (see Figure 8.37). The difference between the distance
from 
to 
and the distance from 
to 
must be a constant. By subtracting these distances, we find
Thus the constant is 
, and it is the length of the transverse axis. The absolute value is
used to ensure that the distance is a positive number.

By looking at the equations, it is possible to determine the location of the transverse axis
by finding which term in the equation is positive. When the 
term is positive, the transverse
axis is on the x-axis. When the 
term is positive, the transverse axis is on the y-axis.
Question • For the graph of 
is the transverse axis on the x-axis or the y-axis?
Consider the hyperbola given by the equation 
Because the 
term is 
positive, the transverse axis is on the x-axis, 
and thus 
The vertices are
and 
To find the foci, we determine c.
The foci are 
and 
The graph is shown in Figure 8.39.
Each hyperbola has two asymptotes that pass through the center of the hyperbola. The
asymptotes of the hyperbola are a useful guide to sketching the graph of the hyperbola.

Find the center, vertices, foci, and asymptotes of the hyperbola given by the equation
Sketch the graph.
Solution
Write the equation of the hyperbola in standard form by completing the square.
• Rearrange terms.
• Factor.
• Complete the square.
• Factor.
• Divide each side by 36.
The coordinates of the center are 
Because the term containing 
is 
positive, the transverse axis is parallel to the y-axis. We know that 
thus

Integrating Technology
A graphing utility can be used to graph a hyperbola. For instance, consider the equation
from Example 2. Rewrite the equation as
In this form, the equation is a quadratic equation in terms of the variable y with
.
Apply the quadratic formula to produce
The graph of Y1
is the upper branch of 
the hyperbola (see Figure 8.45).
The graph of Y2
is the lower branch of 
the hyperbola, as shown in Figure 8.45.
One advantage of this graphing procedure 
is that it does not require us to write the given
equation in standard form. A disadvantage 
of the graphing procedure is that it does not 
indicate where the foci of the hyperbola 
are located.

Eccentricity of a Hyperbola
The graph of a hyperbola can be wide or narrow. The eccentricity of a hyperbola is a meas-
ure of its “wideness.”
Definition of the Eccentricity (e) of a Hyperbola
The eccentricity e of a hyperbola is the ratio of c to a, where c is the distance from
the center to a focus and a is half the length of the transverse axis.
e = c
a
For a hyperbola, 
and therefore 
As the eccentricity of the hyperbola
increases, the graph becomes wider and wider, as shown in Figure 8.46.

EXAMPLE 3
Find the Equation of a Hyperbola Given 
Its Eccentricity
Find the standard form of the equation of the hyperbola that has an eccentricity of
center at the origin, and a focus at 
Solution
Because a focus is located at 
and the center is at the origin, 
An extension
of the transverse axis contains the foci, so the transverse axis is on the x-axis.
• Substitute 6 for c.
• Solve for a.
To find 
use the equation

Applications of Hyperbolas
Orbits of Comets In Section 8.2 we noted that the orbits of the planets are elliptical. Some
comets also have elliptical orbits, the most notable being Halley’s comet, whose eccentricity
is 0.97. See Figure 8.48.
Not drawn to scale.
Figure 8.48
Other comets have hyperbolic orbits with the sun at a focus. These comets pass by the
sun only once. The velocity of a comet determines whether its orbit is elliptical or hyperbolic. 
Hyperbolas as an Aid to Navigation Consider two radio transmitters, 
and 
placed
some distance apart. A ship with electronic equipment measures the difference between the
times it takes signals from the transmitters to reach the ship. Because the difference between
the times is proportional to the difference between the distances of the ship from the trans-
mitters, the ship must be located on the hyperbola with foci at the two transmitters.

Math Matters
Caroline Herschel (1750–1848)
became interested in mathe-
matics and astronomy after her
brother William discovered the
planet Uranus. She was the first
woman to receive credit for the
discovery of a comet. In fact,
between 1786 and 1797, she
discovered eight comets. In 1828
she completed a catalog of more
than 2000 nebulae, a feat for
which the Royal Astronomical
Society of England presented her
with its prestigious gold medal.

Determine the Position of a Ship
Two radio transmitters are positioned along a coastline, 500 miles apart. See Figure 8.50.
Using a long range navigation (LORAN) system, a ship determines that a radio signal
from transmitter 
reaches the ship 1600 microseconds before it receives a simultaneous
signal from transmitter 
a.
Find an equation of a hyperbola (with foci located at 
and 
) on which the
ship lies. See Figure 8.50. (Assume the radio signals travel at 0.186 mile per
microsecond.)
b.
If the ship is directly north of transmitter 
determine how far (to the nearest
mile) the ship is from the transmitter.
Solution
a.
The ship lies on a hyperbola at point B, with foci at 
and 
The difference of the
distances 
and 
is given by
This indicates that the ship is located on a hyperbola with transverse axis of length
297.6 miles. Thus

Polar Coordinate System
Until now, we have used a rectangular coordinate system to locate a point in the coordi-
nate plane. An alternative method is to use a polar coordinate system, wherein a point is
located by giving a distance from a fixed point and an angle from some fixed direction.
A polar coordinate system is formed by drawing a horizontal ray. The ray is called
the polar axis, and the initial point of the ray is called the pole. A point 
in the plane
is located by specifying a directed distance r from the pole and an angle measured from
the polar axis to the line segment OP. The angle can be measured in degrees or radians.
See Figure 8.60.
The coordinates of the pole are 
, where 
is an arbitrary angle. Positive
angles are measured counterclockwise from the polar axis. Negative angles are measured

INTRODUCTION TO POLAR COORDINATES
clockwise from the axis. Positive values of r are measured along the ray that makes an
angle of from the polar axis. Negative values of r are measured along the ray that makes
an angle of 
from the polar axis. See Figure 8.61 and Figure 8.62.
In a rectangular coordinate system, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the
points in the plane and the ordered pairs 
. This is not true for a polar coordinate sys-
tem. For polar coordinates, the relationship is one to many. Infinitely many ordered-pair
descriptions correspond to each point 
in a polar coordinate system.
For example, consider a point whose coordinates are 
. Because there are
360° in one complete revolution around a circle, the point P also could be written as
, as 
, as 
, and generally as 
, where n is an
integer. It is also possible to describe the point 
by 
by 
and by 
, to name just a few options.
The relationship between an ordered pair and a point is not one to many. That is, given
an ordered pair 
, there is exactly one point in the plane that corresponds to that
ordered pair.
Graphs of Equations in a Polar Coordinate System
A polar equation is an equation in r and . A solution to a polar equation is an ordered
pair 
that satisfies the equation. The graph of a polar equation is the set of all points
whose ordered pairs are solutions of the equation.
The graph of the polar equation 
is a line. Because is independent of r, is 
radian from the polar axis for all values of r. The graph is a line that makes an angle of 
radian 
from the polar axis. See Figure 8.63.

Suppose that whenever the ordered pair 
lies on the graph of a polar equation
also lies on the graph. From Figure 8.66, the graph will have symmetry with
respect to the line 
. Thus one test for symmetry is to replace 
by 
in the polar
equation. If the resulting equation is equivalent to the original equation, the graph is sym-
metric with respect to the line 
.
Table 8.2 shows the types of symmetry and their associated tests. For each type, if the
recommended substitution results in an equivalent equation, the graph will have the indi-
cated symmetry. Figure 8.67 illustrates the tests for symmetry with respect to the line 
and for symmetry with respect to the pole.

Solution
Test for symmetry with respect to the line

Because replacing with 
results in the original equation 
the graph is
symmetric with respect to the line

To graph the equation, begin choosing various values of and finding the corre-
sponding values of r. However, before doing so, consider two further observations that
will reduce the number of -values you must choose.
First, because the cosine function is a periodic function with period 2 , it is
only necessary to choose -values between 0 and 
(0° and 360°). Second, when
is negative, which means that any between these values will
produce a negative r. Thus the point will be in the first or fourth quadrant. That is, we
need consider only angles in the first or fourth quadrants. However, because the
graph is symmetric with respect to the line 
, it is only necessary to choose values 
of between 0 and

A limaçon (l_e-m -‘s_on) is a “heart-
shaped” curve. The name limaçon
derives from the Latin word limax,
which means “snail.” The Renais-
sance artist Albrecht Dürer was
the first person to investigate
curves of this type. In 1525 he
published Underweysung der
Messung (Instruction in
Measurement), which illustrated
geometric procedures for 
producing limaçons.

Transformations Between Rectangular and Polar Coordinates
A transformation between coordinate systems is a set of equations that relate the coordi-
nates of a point in one system with the coordinates of the point in a second system. By
superimposing a rectangular coordinate system on a polar system, we can derive the set of
transformation equations.
Construct a polar coordinate system and a rectangular system such that the pole coin-
cides with the origin and the polar axis coincides with the positive x-axis. Let a point P
have the coordinates 
in one system and

each side of a polar equation by r can be used to write the polar equation in rectangular
form. In Example 10 we multiply each side of a polar equation by r to convert the equa-
tion from polar to rectangular form.

Solution
Because the vertex is on the line

Thus the equation of the parabola must involve 
The parabola has a horizontal directrix above the pole, so the equation has the form
The distance from the vertex to the focus is 2, so the distance from the focus to the directrix

Parametric Equations
The graph of a function is a graph for which no vertical line can intersect the graph more
than once. For a graph that is not the graph of a function (an ellipse or a hyperbola, for
example), it is frequently useful to describe the graph by parametric equations.
By plotting the points and drawing a smooth curve through the points, a graph of the para-
metric equations is produced. See Figure 8.89.

Eliminating the Parameter of a Pair of Parametric Equations
It may not be clear from Example 1 and the corresponding graph that the curve is a
parabola. By eliminating the parameter, we can write one equation in x and y that is
equivalent to the two parametric equations.
To eliminate the parameter, solve 
for t.
Substitute 
for t in 
and then simplify.

PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS
A parametric representation of a curve is not unique. That is, it is possible that a curve may
be given by many different pairs of parametric equations. We will demonstrate this by using
the equation of a line and providing two different parametric representations of the line.
Consider a line with slope m passing through the point 
. By the point-slope
formula, the equation of the line is
Let 
. Then 
. A parametric representation is
Let
. Then 
. A parametric representation is
It can be verified that each of these two pairs of parametric equations represent the
original line.
Example 3 illustrates that the domain of the parameter t can be used to determine the
domain and range of the curve defined by the parametric equations.
x = x1 + cot t,
y = y1 + m cot t
for 0 6 t 6 p
y - y1 = m cot t
x - x1 = cot t
x = x1 + t,
y = y1 + mt
for t a real number
y - y1 = mt
t = x - x1
y - y1 = m1x - x12

However, because 
it follows that

Therefore, we have
•
Solving these inequalities for x and y yields
Because the values of y are between 3 and 5, the graph of the parametric equations is
only the top half of the ellipse. See Figure 8.92.

Time as a Parameter
Parametric equations are often used to show the movement of a point or object as it travels
along a curve. For instance, consider the parametric equations
for
For any given value of t in the interval [2, 3], we can evaluate 
and 
to determine a point 
on the curve defined by the equations. See the following table
and Figure 8.93.
(x, y)
y = t + 1
x = t2
-2 … t … 3
y = t + 1
x = t2,
As t takes on values from 
to 3, the curve defined by the parametric equations is
traced in a particular direction. The direction in which the curve is traced—by increasing
values of the parameter t—is referred to as its orientation. In Figure 8.93 the arrowheads
show the orientation of the curve.
In Example 4 we let the parameter t represent time. Then the parametric equations
and 
indicate the x- and y-coordinates of a moving point as a function
of t.
y = g(t)
x = f(t)

Brachistochrone Problem
One famous problem, involving a bead traveling down a frictionless wire, was posed in
1696 by the mathematician Johann Bernoulli. The problem was to determine the shape of

701
8.7
PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS
a wire a bead could slide down such that the distance between two points was traveled in
the shortest time. Problems that involve “shortest time” are called brachistochrone prob-
lems. They are important in physics and form the basis for much of the classical theory of
light propagation.
The answer to Bernoulli’s problem is an arc of an inverted cycloid. See Figure 8.95. A
cycloid is formed by letting a circle of radius a roll on a straight line without slipping. See
Figure 8.96. The curve traced by a point on the circumference of the circle is a cycloid. To
find an equation for this curve, begin by placing a circle tangent to the x-axis with a point
P on the circle and at the origin of a rectangular coordinate system.
Roll the circle along the x-axis. After the radius of the circle has rotated through an
angle , the coordinates of the point 
can be given by
where 
is the current center of the circle.
Because the radius of the circle is a, 
. See Figure 8.96. Because the circle rolls
without slipping, the arc length subtended by 
equals h. Thus 
. Substituting for h
and k in the preceding equations, we have, after factoring,

EXAMPLE 6
Graph the Path of a Projectile
Use a graphing utility to graph the path of a projectile that is launched at an angle
of 
with an initial velocity of 144 feet per second. Use the graph to deter-
mine (to the nearest foot) the maximum height of the projectile and the range of the
projectile. Assume the ground is level.
Solution
Use degree mode and parametric mode. Graph the parametric equations
to produce the graph in Figure 8.99. Use the Maximum and the Zero features to 
determine that the maximum height of 91 feet is attained when 
and
that the projectile strikes the ground about 581 feet downrange when 
.
In Figure 8.99, the angle of launch does not appear to be 32° because 1 foot on the 
x-axis is smaller than 1 foot on the y-axis.

Eliminate the Parameter
Eliminating the parameter is the process of finding an equation in x and
y that has the same graph as the given parametric equations.
Time as a Parameter
Parametric equations can be used to show the movement of a point or 
object as it travels along a curve.
Parametric Equations of a Cycloid
A curve traced by a point P on a circle, with radius a, as the circle rolls 
on the x-axis is a cycloid. The movement of P can be shown by graphing 
the parametric equations
where the value of u is the angle through which the circle has been rotated.
Path of a Projectile
The path of a projectile that is launched at an angle u from the horizon 
with an initial velocity of v0 feet per second is given by the parametric 
equations
where t is the time in seconds since the projectile was launched.

Systems of equations and inequalities are often used to model applications
that involve several variables. In this chapter, systems of equations and
inequalities are used to solve applications from diverse fields, including
business, transportation, operations research, marketing, chemistry,
mathematics, and physiology.
In Example 5, page 758, a system of inequalities is used to determine a

Systems of Linear Equations in 
Two Variables
Recall that an equation of the form 
is a linear equation in two variables. A
solution of a linear equation in two variables is an ordered pair 
that makes the equa-
tion a true statement. For example, 
is a solution of the equation
because
The graph of a linear equation in two variables, a straight line, is the set of points whose
ordered pairs satisfy the equation. Figure 9.1 is the graph of 
A system of equations is two or more equations considered together. The following
system of equations is a linear system of equations in two variables.
A solution of a system of equations in two variables is an ordered pair that is a solution
of both equations.
In Figure 9.2, the graphs of the two equations in the system of equations above inter-
sect at the point 
Because that point lies on both lines, 
is a solution of both
equations and thus is a solution of the system of equations. The point 
is a solution
of the first equation but not a solution of the second equation. Therefore, 
is not a
solution of the system of equations.
Question • Is 
a solution of the system shown at the right?
A system of equations is a consistent system if it has at least one solution.
A system of equations with no solution is an inconsistent system.
A system of linear equations with exactly one solution is an independent system.
A system of linear equations with an infinite number of solutions is a dependent system.
The graphs of the two equations in a linear system of two variables can intersect at a
single point, be the same line, or be parallel lines. See Figure 9.3.

SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES
Some of the specific ordered-pair solutions in Example 3 can be found by choosing
various values for c. Table 9.1 shows the ordered pairs that result from choosing 1, 3, and
4 for c. The ordered pairs 
and 
are specific solutions of the system
of equations. These points are on the graphs of Equation (1) and Equation (2), as shown
in Figure 9.4.
Before leaving Example 3, note that there is more than one way to represent the
ordered-pair solutions. To illustrate this point, solve Equation (2) for x.
• Equation (2)
• Solve for x.
Because y can be replaced by any real number b, there are an infinite number of ordered
pairs
that are solutions of the system of equations. Choosing 
2, and 4 
for b produces the same ordered pairs—
and 
—that we found in
Table 9.1. There is always more than one way to describe the ordered pairs when writing
the solution of a dependent system of equations. For Example 3, either of the ordered pairs
or 
would generate all the solutions of the system of equations.
Elimination Method for Solving a System of Equations
Two systems of equations are equivalent if the systems have exactly the same solutions.
The systems
and
are equivalent systems of equations. Each system has the solution 
as shown in
Figure 9.5.
A second technique for solving a system of equations is similar to the strategy for
solving first-degree equations in one variable. The system of equations is replaced by a
series of equivalent systems until the solution is apparent.
Operations That Produce Equivalent Systems of Equations
1. Interchange any two equations.
2. Replace an equation with a nonzero constant multiple of that equation.
3. Replace an equation with the sum of that equation and a nonzero constant
multiple of another equation in the system.

Because the order in which the equations are written does not affect the system of
equations, interchanging the equations does not affect its solution. The second operation
restates the property that multiplying each side of an equation by the same nonzero con-
stant does not change the solutions of the equation.
The third operation can be illustrated as follows. Consider the system of equations
Multiply each side of Equation (2) by 2. (Any nonzero number would work.) Add the
resulting equation to Equation (1).

SYSTEMS OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES
The method just described is called the elimination method for solving a system of
equations, because it involves eliminating a variable from one of the equations.
Integrating Technology
You can use a graphing calculator to solve a system of equations in two variables. First,
algebraically solve each equation for y.
Solve for y.
Now graph the equations. Enter 0.75X–2.5 into Y1 and -0.4X–0.2 into Y2 and
graph the two equations in the standard viewing window. The sequence of steps shown
in Figure 9.7 can be used to find the point of intersection with a TI-83/TI-83 Plus/
TI-84 Plus graphing calculator.
y = -0.4x - 0.2
:
 2x + 5y = -1
y =  0.75x - 2.5
:
 3x - 4y =  10
In this example, the intersection of the two graphs occurs at a point in the standard
viewing window. If the point of intersection does not appear on the screen, you must
adjust the viewing window so that the point of intersection is visible.

• Add the two equations.

• This is an equivalent system of equations.
Because the equation

Because x can be replaced by 
any real number c, the solutions of the system of equations are the ordered pairs

Try Exercise 28, page 726
If one equation of a system of equations is replaced with a false equation, the system
of equations has no solution. For example, the system of equations
has no solution because the second equation is false for any choice of x and y.
Applications of Systems of Equations
Consider the situation of a Corvette car dealership. If the dealership were willing to sell a
Corvette for $10, there would be many consumers willing to buy a Corvette. The problem
with this plan is that the dealership would soon be out of business. On the other hand, if
the dealership tried to sell each Corvette for $1 million, the dealership would not sell any
cars and would still go out of business. Between $10 and $1 million, there is a price at
which a dealership can sell Corvettes (and stay in business) and at which consumers are
willing to pay that price. This price is referred to as the equilibrium price.
Economists refer to these types of problems as supply–demand problems. Businesses
are willing to supply a product at a certain price, and there is consumer demand for the prod-
uct at that price. To find the equilibrium point, a system of equations is created. One equa-
tion of the system is the supply model of the business. The second equation is the demand
model of the consumer.

Solve the system of equations by using substitution.

A rowing team rowing with the current traveled 18 miles in 2 hours. Against the cur-
rent, the team rowed 10 miles in 2 hours. Find the rate of the boat in calm water and
the rate of the current.
Solution
Let 
represent the rate of the boat in calm water, and let 
represent the rate of the
current.
The rate of the boat with the current is
The rate of the boat against the current is
Because the rowing team traveled 18 miles in 2 hours with the current, we use the
equation
•
• Divide each side by 2.
Because the team rowed 10 miles in 2 hours against the current, we write
•
• Divide each side by 2.
5 = r1 - r2
r = r1 - r2, d = 10, t = 2
 10 = (r1 - r2) # 2
9 = r1 + r2
r = r1 + r2, d = 18, t = 2
 18 = (r1 + r2) # 2
d = r # t
d = rt.

p = 2.72
-250p = -680
-250p + 655 = -25
-150p + 655 = 100p - 25
e x = 100p - 25
x = -150p + 655
x = -150p + 655,
x = 100p - 25,
Uniform Motion Problems
See page 89.
Against current: 10 miles in 2 hours
Rate = r1 + r2
Rate of
current: r2
Rate of boat in
calm water: r1
With current: 18 miles in 2 hours
Rate = r1 −r2
(continued)

Thus we have a system of two linear equations in the variables 
and 
Solving the system by using the elimination method, we find that 
is 7 miles per
hour and 
is 2 miles per hour. Thus the rate of the boat in calm water is 7 miles per
hour and the rate of the current is 2 miles per hour. You should verify these solutions.

Systems of Linear Equations in Three Variables
An equation of the form 
with A, B, and C not all zero, is a linear equa-
tion in three variables. A solution of an equation in three variables is an ordered triple
The ordered triple 
is one of the solutions of the equation 
The ordered triple 
is another solution. In fact, an infinite number of ordered triples
are solutions of the equation.
Graphing an equation in three variables requires a third coordinate axis perpendicu-
lar to the xy-plane. This third axis is commonly called the z-axis. The result is a three-
dimensional coordinate system called the xyz-coordinate system (See Figure 9.9). To
visualize a three-dimensional coordinate system, think of a corner of a room: the floor is
the xy-plane, one wall is the yz-plane, and the other wall is the xz-plane.
Graphing an ordered triple requires three moves: the first along the x-axis, the second
along the y-axis, and the third along the z-axis. Figure 9.10 is the graph of the points
and (4, 5, -2).

The graph of a linear equation in three variables is a plane. That is, if all the solutions
of a linear equation in three variables were plotted in an xyz-coordinate system, the graph
would look like a large, flat piece of paper with infinite extent. Figure 9.11 is a portion of
the graph of 
There are different ways in which three planes can be oriented in an xyz-coordinate
system. Figure 9.12 illustrates several ways.
For a system of linear equations in three variables to have a solution, the graphs of the
equations must be three planes that intersect at a point, be three planes that intersect along
a common line, or all be the same plane. In Figure 9.12, the graphs in a., b., and c. repre-
sent systems of equations that have a solution. The system of equations represented in
Figure 9.12a is a consistent system of equations. Figure 9.12b and Figure 9.12c are graphs

Triangular Form
There are many approaches we can take to determine the solution of a system of equations
by the elimination method. For consistency, we will generally follow a plan that produces
an equivalent system of equations in triangular form. Three examples of systems of equa-
tions in triangular form are
Once a system of equations is written in triangular form, the solution can be found by
back substitution—that is, by solving the last equation of the system and substituting back
into the previous equation. This process is continued until the value of each variable has
been found.
As an example of solving a system of equations by back substitution, consider the fol-
lowing system of equations in triangular form.

Solving Nonlinear Systems of Equations
A nonlinear system of equations is one in which one or more equations of the system are
not linear equations. In this section, we will only consider solutions whose coordinates are real
numbers. Therefore, if a system of equations does not have any solution in which both coor-
dinates are real numbers, we will simply state that the system has no solution.
Figure 9.17 shows examples of nonlinear systems of equations and the corresponding
graphs of the equations. Each point of intersection of the graphs is a solution of the system

Partial Fraction Decomposition
An algebraic application of systems of equations is a technique known as partial fractions.
In Chapter P, we reviewed the problem of adding two rational expressions. For example,
Now we will take the opposite approach. That is, given a rational expression, we will find
simpler rational expressions whose sum is the given expression. The method by which a
more complicated rational expression is written as a sum of simpler rational expressions is
called partial fraction decomposition. This technique is based on the following theorem.
Partial Fraction Decomposition Theorem
If
is a rational expression in which the degree of the numerator is less than the degree
of the denominator, and 
and 
have no common factors, then 
can be
written as a partial fraction decomposition in the form
where each 
has one of the following forms.

PARTIAL FRACTIONS
The procedure for finding a partial fraction decomposition of a rational expression
depends on the factorization of the denominator of the rational expression. There are four
cases.
Case 1
Nonrepeated Linear Factors
The partial fraction decomposition will contain an expression of the form 
for each
nonrepeated linear factor of the denominator. For example, in the rational expression
each linear factor of the denominator occurs only once. Thus its partial fraction decom-
position has the form
Case 2
Repeated Linear Factors
The partial fraction decomposition will contain an expression of the form
for each repeated linear factor of multiplicity m. For example, in the rational expression
the linear factor (x - 2) is a repeated linear factor. Thus its partial fraction decomposition
has the form
Case 3
Nonrepeated Quadratic Factors
The partial fraction decomposition will contain an expression of the form
for each quadratic factor that is irreducible over the real numbers. For example, in the
rational expression
the quadratic factor 
is irreducible over the real numbers. Thus its partial frac-
tion decomposition has the form

Graphing an Inequality
Two examples of inequalities in two variables are
and
A solution of an inequality in two variables is an ordered pair 
, with real coordinates,
that satisfies the inequality. For example, 
is a solution of the first inequality
because 
The ordered pair 
is not a solution of the second inequal-
ity because 
The solution set of an inequality in two variables is the set of all ordered pairs, with
real coordinates, that satisfy the inequality. The graph of an inequality is the graph of the
solution set.
To sketch the graph of an inequality, first replace the inequality symbol with an equal-
ity sign and sketch the graph of the equation. Use a dashed graph for 
or 
to indicate
that the curve is not part of the solution set. Use a solid graph for 
or 
to show that the
curve is part of the solution set.
It is important to test an ordered pair in each region of the plane defined by the graph.
If the ordered pair satisfies the inequality, shade that entire region. Do this for each region
into which the graph divides the plane. For example, consider the inequality 
Figure 9.19 shows the three regions of the plane defined by this inequality. Because the
inequality is 
a solid graph is used.
Choose an ordered pair in each of the three regions and determine whether that
ordered pair satisfies the inequality. In Region I, choose a point, say 
Because
Region I is part of the solution set. In Region II, choose a point, say (0, 0).

Many fitness experts recommend that you participate in an aerobic exercise program
at least three times a week. They also recommend that during these workouts your heart
rate stays within 60% to 80% of your maximum heart rate. Several popular methods are
used to establish a person’s maximum heart rate. The following maximum heart rate for-
mula is based on research by the Department of Kinesiology and Applied Physiology at the
University of Colorado.1
where x is a person’s age in years. 
EXAMPLE 5
Find a Targeted Exercise Heart Rate Range
A health club uses the following system of inequalities to determine targeted exercise
heart rate ranges based on a person’s age. In this system, y is the person’s exercise heart
rate in beats per minute and x is the person’s age in years. 
Inequality (1) is used to determine the minimum of a person’s targeted exercise
heart rate range, and Inequality (2) is used to determine the maximum of a person’s
targeted exercise heart rate range. 
Determine the targeted exercise heart rate range for Emily, who just turned 30.
Round minimum and maximum values to the nearest beat per minute. 
Solution
Substitute Emily’s age, 30, for x in Inequality (1) to determine the minimum of her
targeted exercise heart rate range. Substitute 30 for x in Inequality (2) to determine
the maximum of her targeted exercise heart rate range. 
Emily’s target exercise heart rate range is 112 to 150 beats per minute. 
Try Exercise 46, page 761
A graph of the system of inequalities in Example 5 is shown in Figure 9.25. Some
health clubs use this graph to estimate a person’s targeted exercise heart rate range. To use
the graph, estimate the height of the lower and upper boundaries of the heart rate target
zone for a given age x. The red dashed lines show that Emily, age 30, has a targeted exer-
cise heart rate range of about 112 to 150 beats per minute.

Introduction to Linear Programming
Consider a business analyst who is trying to maximize the profit from the production of a
product or an engineer who is trying to minimize the amount of energy an electric circuit
needs to operate. Generally, problems that seek to maximize or minimize a situation are
called optimization problems. One strategy for solving these problems was developed in
the 1940s and is called linear programming.
A linear programming problem involves a linear objective function, which is the
function that must be maximized or minimized. This objective function is subject to some
constraints, which are inequalities or equations that restrict the values of the variables. To
illustrate these concepts, suppose a manufacturer produces 17- and 24-inch computer mon-
itors. Past sales experience shows that at least twice as many 17-inch monitors are sold as
24-inch monitors. Suppose further that the manufacturing plant is capable of producing 12
monitors per day. Let x represent the number of 17-inch monitors produced per day, and
let y represent the number of 24-inch monitors produced per day. Then
• These are the constraints.

LINEAR PROGRAMMING
These two inequalities place constraints, or restrictions, on the manufacturer. For
example, the manufacturer cannot produce five 24-inch monitors per day, because that
would require producing at least ten 17-inch monitors, and 
Suppose a profit of $50 is earned on each 17-inch monitor sold and $75 is earned on
each 24-inch monitor sold. Then the manufacturer’s daily profit P, in dollars, is given by
the equation
• Objective function
The equation 
defines the objective function. The goal of this linear pro-
gramming problem is to determine how many of each monitor should be produced to max-
imize the manufacturer’s profit and satisfy the constraints.
Because the manufacturer cannot produce fewer than zero units of either monitor,
there are two other implied constraints: 
and 
Our linear programming prob-
lem now looks like
Objective function
Constraints
To solve this problem, we graph the solution set of the constraints. The solution set of the
constraints is called the set of feasible solutions. Ordered pairs in this set are used to eval-
uate the objective function to determine which ordered pair maximizes the profit. For
example, 
and 
are three ordered pairs in the set. See Figure 9.29. For
these ordered pairs, the profits would be
•
•
•
It would be impossible to check every ordered pair in the set of feasible solutions to
find which one maximizes profit. Fortunately, we can find that ordered pair by solving the
objective function 
for y.
In this form, the objective function is a linear equation whose graph has a slope of 
and a y-intercept of
If P is as large as possible (P a maximum), then the y-intercept
will be as large as possible. Thus the maximum profit will occur on the line that has a slope
of 
, has the largest possible y-intercept, and intersects the set of feasible solutions.
From Figure 9.30, the largest possible y-intercept occurs when the line passes through
the point with the coordinates 
At this point, the profit is
The manufacturer will maximize profit by producing 8 17-inch monitors and 4 24-inch
monitors each day. The profit will be $700 per day.
In general, the goal of any linear programming problem is to maximize or minimize
the objective function, subject to the constraints. Minimization problems occur, for exam-
ple, when a manufacturer wants to minimize the cost of operations.

Answer • 2.
Suppose that a cost minimization problem results in the following objective function
and constraints.
Objective function
Constraints
Figure 9.31 is the graph of the solution set of the constraints. The task is to find the
ordered pair that satisfies all the constraints and gives the smallest value of C. We again
could solve the objective function for y and, because we want to minimize C, find the
smallest y-intercept. However, a theorem from linear programming simplifies our task
even more. The proof of this theorem, omitted here, is based on the techniques we used to
solve our examples.
Fundamental Linear Programming Theorem
If an objective function has an optimal solution, then that solution will be at a ver-
tex of the set of feasible solutions.
Following is a list of the values of C at the vertices. The minimum value of the objec-
tive function occurs at the point whose coordinates are 
• Minimum
• Maximum
The maximum value of the objective function can also be determined from the list. It
occurs at 
It is important to realize that the maximum or minimum value of an objective func-
tion depends on the objective function and on the set of feasible solutions. For example,
using the set of feasible solutions in Figure 9.31 but changing the objective function to
changes the maximum value of C to 25, at the ordered pair
You should
verify this result by making a list similar to the one shown above.

Solution
Determine the set of feasible solutions by graphing the solution set of the inequalities.
See Figure 9.32. Note that in this instance the set of feasible solutions is an unbounded
region with four vertices. The vertex on the y-axis is the y-intercept of the line
which is (0, 6). The vertex on the x-axis is the x-intercept of the line
which is (6, 0).

To find the other two vertices of the region, solve the following systems of
equations.
The solutions of the two systems are 
and 
respectively.

SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS AND INEQUALITIES

Exploring Concepts with Technology
Ill-Conditioned Systems of Equations
Solving systems of equations algebraically, as we did in this chapter, is not practical for
systems of equations that contain a large number of variables. In such cases, a com-
puter solution is the only hope. Computer solutions are not without some problems,
however.
Consider the system of equations
It is easy to verify that the solution of this system of equations is 
. However,
change the constant 0.73700 to 0.73701 (add 0.00001) and the constant 2.52935 to
2.52936 (add 0.00001), and the solution is now 
. Thus a very small change in the
constant terms produces a dramatic change in the solution. A system of equations of
this sort is said to be ill-conditioned.
These types of systems are important because computers generally cannot store
numbers beyond a certain number of significant digits. Your calculator, for example,
probably allows you to enter no more than 10 significant digits. If an exact number
cannot be entered, then an approximation to that number is necessary. When a com-
puter is solving an equation or a system of equations, the hope is that approximations
of the coefficients it uses will give reasonable approximations to the solutions. For ill-
conditioned systems of equations, this is not always true.
In the system of equations above, small changes in the constant terms caused a
large change in the solution. It is possible that small changes in the coefficients of the
variables will also cause large changes in the solution.
In the two systems of equations that follow, examine the effects of approximating
the fractional coefficients on the solutions. Try approximating each fraction to the
nearest hundredth, to the nearest thousandth, to the nearest ten-thousandth, and then
to the limits of your calculator. The exact solution of the first system of equations
is
. The exact solution of the second system of equations is
.
Note how the solutions change as the approximations change and thus how impor-
tant it is to know whether a system of equations is ill-conditioned. For systems that are
not ill-conditioned, approximations of the coefficients yield reasonable approximations
of the solution. For ill-conditioned systems of equations, this is not always true.

each equation of the system. Systems of equations are equivalent if the 
systems have exactly the same solutions. The substitution method and the 
elimination method are often used to solve these systems.
• Substitution Method Solve one of the equations to find an expression
for one variable in terms of the other variable. Substitute this expression
into the other equation to produce an equation that only involves one
variable. 
• Elimination Method Multiply one or both equations by appropriate
nonzero constants so that the sum of the resulting equations is an
equation in one variable.
The elimination method uses the following operations to produce
equivalent systems until the solution or solutions of the original system
are apparent.
1. Interchange any two equations.
2. Replace an equation with a nonzero constant multiple of that equation.
3. Replace an equation with the sum of that equation and a nonzero
constant multiple of another equation. 
Classification of Systems of Equations A system of equations is a

no solution is an inconsistent system.
• A system of linear equations with exactly one solution is an
independent system. A system of linear equations with an infinite
number of solutions is a dependent system. 
The graphs of the two equations in a linear system of two variables
can intersect at a single point, be the same line, or be parallel lines.

equation in three variables. A solution of a linear system of equations in 
three variables is an ordered triple whose coordinates satisfy each of the 
equations in the system. The elimination method is often used to solve 
systems of linear equations in three variables by rewriting the system in 
an equivalent triangular form.

systems of equations have either no solution or an infinite number of 
solutions. The elimination method can often be used to solve these systems.

equations. The ordered triple (0, 0, 0) is always a solution of a homogeneous 
system of linear equations in three variables. This solution is called the trivial 
solution. A homogeneous system of linear equations will have exactly one 
solution (the trivial solution) or an infinite number of solutions.

used to find the solutions to these systems. A graph of the equations in the 
system can be used to visualize how many solutions to expect and the 
approximate coordinates of the solutions. 
9.4 Partial Fractions

34, and 36, page 775.
of the rational expression. The procedure for finding a partial fraction
decomposition of a rational expression depends on the factors in its 
denominator. 
The Partial Fraction Decomposition Theorem requires that the degree
of the numerator of the rational expression be less than the degree of its
denominator. If this is not the case, use long division to first write the
rational expression as the sum of a polynomial and a rational expression
whose numerator is of lesser degree than its denominator.

MATRICES
Matrices and Computer Games
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers enclosed in brackets, as shown
in the example at the left. This particular matrix is called a transformation
matrix for an object in the coordinate plane. This matrix and the operation
of matrix multiplication can be used to rotate a rectangle 45° about a fixed
point. In this case, the transformation matrix is a rotation matrix.
There are other types of transfomation matrices such as scaling matrices
(which make an object smaller or larger), translation matrices (which move
an object horizontally, vertically, or both), and reflection matrices (which
produce a mirror image of an object). By using several matrices and
matrix operations, we can transform the small red triangle 
into the larger green triangle.
The advantage of using matrices to perform transformations is that they can
be used in conjunction with computer programs. Animators for films such as
Shrek and programmers who create video games such as Harry Potter and
the Goblet of Fire use transformation matrices and the speed of a computer
to transform one scene into another scene. Their task is quite challenging
because more than one object may be involved, the object (like Harry Potter)
may be complicated, and there may be a need for a three-dimensional effect.
In addition to animation, matrices are used in many other disciplines such
as ecology, economics, chemistry, physics, and biology. To read about
another matrix application, see Example 6, page 807.

Introduction to Matrices
A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. Each number in a matrix is called an element
of the matrix. The matrix below, with three rows and four columns, is called a 
(read
“3 by 4”) matrix.
A matrix of m rows and n columns is said to be of order m  n or dimension m  n. A
square matrix of order n is a matrix with n rows and n columns. The matrix above has
order 
. We will use the notation 
to refer to the element of a matrix in the ith row
and jth column. For the matrix given above, 
and
The elements 
form the main diagonal of a matrix. The elements
2, 6, and 7 form the main diagonal of the matrix shown above.
A matrix can be created from a system of linear equations. Consider the system of lin-
ear equations
Using only the coefficients and constants of this system, we can write the 
matrix
This matrix is called the augmented matrix of the system of equations. The matrix
formed by the coefficients of the system is the coefficient matrix. The matrix formed
from the constants is the constant matrix for the system. The coefficient matrix and con-
stant matrix for the given system are
Coefficient matrix:
Constant matrix:
We can write a system of equations from an augmented matrix.

Introduction to Matrices
Elementary Row Operations
Gaussian Elimination Method
Application: Interpolating
Polynomials
Note
When a term is missing from one
of the equations of a system (as in
the second equation at the right),
the coefficient of that term is 0,
and a 0 is entered in the matrix.
A vertical bar that separates the
coefficients of the variables from
the constants is frequently drawn
in the augmented matrix.
Math Matters
The word matrix has the Latin
word mater as its root. The
mathematician James Sylvester
(1814–1897) coined the term to
indicate a place from which
something else originates.
Sylvester, born in London, spent
the last part of his life at Johns
Hopkins University, where he was
influential in establishing graduate
study programs in mathematics.

In certain cases, an augmented matrix represents a system of equations that we can solve
by back substitution. Consider the following augmented matrix and the equivalent system
of equations.
Solving this system by using back substitution, we find that the solution is 
The matrix above is in row echelon form.
Definition of Row Echelon Form
A matrix is in row echelon form if all of the following conditions are satisfied.
1. The first nonzero number in any row is a 1.
2. Rows are arranged so that the column containing the first nonzero number in
any row is to the left of the column containing the first nonzero number of the
next row.
3. All rows consisting entirely of zeros appear at the bottom of the matrix.
EXAMPLE
The following matrices are in row echelon form.
Question • Is the augmented matrix 
in row echelon form?
Elementary Row Operations
We can write an augmented matrix in row echelon form by using elementary row opera-
tions. These operations are a rewording, in matrix terminology, of the operations that pro-
duce equivalent systems of equations.

Integrating Technology
For many graphing calculators,
the elementary row operations
are built-in functions.
Elementary Row Operations
Given the augmented matrix for a system of linear equations, each of the follow-
ing elementary row operations produces a matrix of an equivalent system of
equations.
1. Interchange any two rows.
2. Multiply each element in a row by the same nonzero constant.
3. Replace a row with the sum of that row and a nonzero multiple of any
other row.
It is convenient to specify each row operation symbolically as follows.
1. Interchange the ith and jth rows: 
2. Multiply each element of the ith row by k, a nonzero constant: 
3. Replace the jth row with the sum of that row and a nonzero multiple of the ith row:
To demonstrate these operations, we will use the 
matrix 
.
• Interchange row 1 and row 3.
• Multiply row 2 by -3.
In Example 2, we use elementary row operations to write a matrix in row echelon
form. As we carry out this procedure, to conserve space, we will occasionally perform
more than one elementary row operation in one step. For instance, the notation
means that two combinations of elementary row operations are performed. First, multiply
row 1 by 3 and add it to row 2. Replace row 2. Second, multiply row 1 by 
and add it to
row 3. Replace row 3.

The row echelon form given by the calculator is different from the one we produced in

which a row echelon form of the matrix is required.

The Gaussian elimination method
is the procedure used in some
computer programs to solve a
system of equations.
Gaussian Elimination Method
The Gaussian elimination method is an algorithm1 that uses elementary row operations
to solve a system of linear equations. The goal of this method is to rewrite an augmented
matrix in row echelon form.
We will now demonstrate how to solve a system of two equations in two variables by
the Gaussian elimination method. Consider the system of equations

The goal of the Gaussian elimination method is to rewrite the augmented matrix in row
echelon form by using elementary row operations. The row operations are chosen so that,
first, there is a 1 as 
second, there is a 0 as 
and third, there is a 1 as 
Begin by multiplying row 1 by 
The result is a 1 as 
Now multiply row 1 by 
and add the result to row 2. Replace row 2. The result is a 0
as
Now multiply row 2 by

Application: Interpolating Polynomials
One application of the Gaussian elimination method of solving a system of equations is in
finding interpolating polynomials.
Definition of an Interpolating Polynomial
Let
be the coordinates of a set of 
points
for which all the 
are distinct. Then the interpolating polynomial is a unique
polynomial of degree at most n whose graph passes through the given points.
EXAMPLE 7
Find an Interpolating Polynomial
Find the interpolating polynomial whose graph passes through the points whose coordi-
nates are 
and 
Solution
Because there are three given points, the degree of the interpolating polynomial will be
at most 2. The form of the polynomial will be

Note
Because the subscript on the first
ordered pair is zero, there are
points. The degree of the
interpolating polynomial, how-
ever, is n. Thus, if there were
three ordered pairs, the degree of
the interpolating polynomial
would be at most 2. If there were
seven ordered pairs, the degree of
the interpolating polynomial
would be at most 6.

Addition and Subtraction of Matrices
In addition to being convenient for solving systems of equations, matrices are useful tools
for modeling problems in business and science. One prevalent application of matrices is to
spreadsheet programs.
The typical method used in spreadsheets is to number the rows as 1, 2, 3
and to
identify the columns as 
The partial spreadsheet below shows how a con-
sumer’s car loan is being repaid over a 5-year period. The elements in column A represent
the loan amounts, in dollars, at the beginning of each year; column B represents the
amount owed at the end of each year; and column C represents the amount of interest paid
during the year.

For instance, the element in 3C means that the consumer paid $445.82 in interest during
the third year of the loan.

Answer • At the beginning of the third year of the loan, the consumer owed $6,470.56.

Matrices are effective for modeling situations in which there are a number of items
to be classified. For instance, suppose a music store has sales for January as shown in
the following matrix.
This matrix indicates, for instance, that the music store sold 40 classical DVDs in January.
Now consider a similar matrix for February.
Looking at this matrix and the matrix for January reveals that the number of R&B DVDs
sold for the two months is 
. By adding the elements in corresponding cells,
we obtain the total sales for the two months. In matrix notation, this would be shown as

In the matrix that represents the sum, 857 (in row 1, column 1) indicates that a total of 857
rock music CDs were sold in January and February. Similarly, a total of 91 (in row 2, col-
umn 4) classical DVDs were sold for the two months.
This example suggests that the addition of two matrices should be performed by
adding the corresponding elements. Before we actually state this definition, we first intro-
duce some notation and a definition of equality.
Throughout this book a matrix will be indicated by using a capital letter or by enclos-
ing a lowercase letter in brackets. Thus a matrix can be denoted as

It is standard practice to use a
matrix when dealing with
points in a plane, which is a two-
dimensional space. The reason for
this has to do with the translation
of points and is explained in texts
on computer graphics. Because of
this practice, a column matrix of

Transformation Matrices
As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, matrices are used in computer science to
create video games. This is accomplished through transformation matrices that can,
among other operations, translate, reflect, and rotate points and figures in the plane and in
space. These concepts are similar to the transformations of functions discussed earlier in
the text. Here are some examples of transformation matrices.

Note
The x-coordinates form the first
row of the matrix containing the
coordinates of the vertices; the 
y-coordinates form the second
row; the last row is all 1s. We may
begin at any vertex but then must
proceed in one direction around
the figure. For instance, we could 
have used 
as the 
matrix of the coordinates of
the vertices of triangle ABC in
Figure 10.2.

Matrices can be used to transform a set of points
such as a geometric figure or the graph of an equa-
tion. For instance, in Figure 10.2, triangle ABC has
been reflected across the x-axis. The coordinates of
the vertices of the resulting triangle, A¿B¿C¿, can be
determined by using a transformation matrix. Note
that the coordinates of the vertices are the columns
of a matrix.

Rotation matrices are used to rotate a figure about the origin. Although a figure
can be rotated any number of degrees, we will consider only the following rotations.
Standard convention is that positive degree rotations are counterclockwise.
Rotate 90° about (0, 0).
Rotate 180° about (0, 0).
Rotate 270° about (0, 0).
For instance, suppose 
is applied to triangle ABC in Figure 10.3. Then
The vertices of the resulting figure are 
, and 
. See
Figure 10.3.
The rotation matrices rotate the entire coordinate grid about the origin. Example 4c
demonstrates how to rotate a figure about a point other than the origin.
EXAMPLE 4
Use Transformation Matrices
Consider the quadrilateral ABCD in Figure 10.4.
a.
Write a matrix of the vertices of the figure.
b.
Find the vertices of the figure after it has been reflected
across the x-axis.
c.
Find the vertices of the figure after it has been rotated
90° about vertex B.
Solution
a.
One possibility for the matrix of the vertices is 
, where we 
have written the vertices in the order of points A, B, C, and D. Any order that goes
around the figure is a valid matrix of the vertices.
b.
The vertices of the resulting figure are 
, and
. See Figure 10.5a.
c.
Because a rotation matrix rotates a figure about the origin, to rotate the figure
around point B, first translate the figure so that B is at the origin using the
translation matrix 
.

Adjacency Matrices
In the movie Good Will Hunting, the main character, Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon,
is a janitor at a university. As he is mopping floors, he notices a problem posted on a board,
intended as a challenge problem for math students. The
first two parts of the problem are given below.
Let G be the graph shown at the right.
1. Find the adjacency matrix A of the graph G.
2. Find the matrix giving the number of three-step 
walks for the graph G.
A graph is a set points, frequently called vertices, that are con-
nected by line segments called edges. The graph H, shown at the right,
has five vertices. Moving from one vertex to another along a single edge
that joins them is a step. A walk is a series of steps from one vertex to
another; the number of steps is the length of the walk. For instance, for
graph H, there is a walk of three steps from vertex 3 to vertex 4 using
the steps 
There is no walk of length 1 from vertex 3 to
vertex 4 because no edge connects those vertices.
The adjacency matrix A for a graph is an 
matrix,
where n is the number of vertices in the graph. The 
element
of the adjacency matrix for a graph is equal to the number of
edges between vertex i and vertex j. The adjacency matrix for
the graph H is shown at the right. Note that the element
because there is one edge between vertex 3 and ver-
tex 2 of graph H. Also, 
because there is no edge
between vertex 4 and vertex 2 of graph H.
For an adjacency matrix A, the matrix An gives the number of walks of length n
between two vertices. Using the adjacency matrix for graph H, the matrix A3, shown at the
left, gives the number of walks of length 3 (the exponent of 
) between two vertices of H.
For instance, a23 = 4. This means that there are four walks of length 3 that connect vertex 2
and vertex 3. They are

Find Walks Through a Graph
Consider the graph in Figure 10.6.
a.
Find the adjacency matrix A.
b.
Find A3 and use it to determine the number of walks of length 3 between vertex 2
and vertex 3.
Solution
a.
There are 4 vertices, so the adjacency matrix will be a 4 * 4 matrix. Place a 1 in
the 
entry if there is an edge connecting the two vertices i and j otherwise, place
a 0 in the 
entry. The matrix is shown below.
b.
A3 gives the number of walks of length 3 between any two vertices. 
so there
is one walk of length 3 between vertex 2 and vertex 3. The walk is 
.

Applications of Matrices
Matrices often can be used to solve applications in which a sequence of events repeats itself
over a period. For instance, the following application is from the field of botany.
A biennial plant matures 1 year after a seed is planted. In the second year the plant
produces seeds that will become the new plants in the third year, and then the 2-year-old
plant dies. Suppose that a wilderness area currently contains 500,000 of a certain biennial
and that there are 225,000 plants in their first year and 275,000 in their second year.
Suppose also that 70% of the 1-year-old plants survive to the second year and that each
1000 second-year plants give rise to 1400 new first-year plants. See Figure 10.7.
With this information, a botanist can predict how many plants will be in the wilder-
ness area after n years. The formula for the number of plants is given by
For instance, to find the number of each type of plant in 5 years, the botanist would
calculate
The resulting matrix indicates that after 5 years there would be 369,754 first-year plants
and 151,263 second-year plants.

Math Matters
Here are some of the contexts in
which graph theory is used.
Molecules: Atoms are the vertices;
chemical bonds are the edges.
Websites: Web pages are the ver-
tices; links (URLs) are the edges.
Social networks (Facebook):
People are the vertices; friends are
the edges.

EXAMPLE 6
Solve an Application
A local trailer rental agency has offices in Tampa and St. Petersburg, Florida. To
start with, the agency has 40% of its trailers in Tampa and the other 60% in St.
Petersburg. The agency finds that each week
86% of the Tampa rentals are returned to the Tampa office, and the other 14% 
are returned to the St. Petersburg office.
81% of the St. Petersburg rentals are returned to the St. Petersburg office, and the
other 19% are returned to the Tampa office. See Figure 10.8.
The owner of the agency has determined that after n weeks the percent of the
trailers that will be at the Tampa office T and the percent of the trailers that will be at
the St. Petersburg office S is given by
Find the percent of the trailers that will be at the Tampa office after 3 weeks and
after 8 weeks.
Solution
Using a calculator, we find
and
Thus, after 3 weeks, the Tampa office will have about 52.3% of the trailers, and after 8
weeks the Tampa office will have about 56.9% of the trailers.

39. Life Sciences Biologists use capture–recapture models to esti-
mate how many animals live in a certain area. A sample of fish
are caught and tagged. When subsequent samples of fish are
caught, a biologist can use a capture history matrix to record
(with a 1) which, if any, of the fish in the original sample have
been caught again. The rows of this matrix represent the partic-
ular fish (each has its own identification number), and the
columns represent the number of the sample in which the fish
was caught. Here is a small capture history matrix.

40. Life Sciences Biologists can use a predator–prey matrix to
study the relationships among animals in an ecosystem. Each
row and each column represents an animal in the system. A 1
as an element in the matrix indicates that the animal repre-
sented by that row preys on the animal represented by that col-
umn. A 0 indicates that the animal in that row does not prey on
the animal in that column. A simple predator-prey matrix is
shown below. The abbreviations are

Answer • The real number zero does not have a multiplicative inverse.
Finding the Inverse of a Matrix
Recall that the multiplicative inverse of a nonzero real number c is 
the number whose
product with c is 1. For example, the multiplicative inverse of 
is 
because 
.
For some square matrices, we can define a multiplicative inverse.
Definition of the Multiplicative Inverse of a Matrix
If A is a square matrix of order n, then the inverse of matrix A, denoted by 
,
has the property that
where 
is the identity matrix of order n.
As we will see shortly, not every square matrix has a multiplicative inverse.
Question • Is there any real number that does not have a multiplicative inverse?
A procedure for finding the inverse of a matrix (we will simply say inverse for multi-
plicative inverse) uses elementary row operations. The procedure will be illustrated by
finding the inverse of a 
matrix.
Let
. To the matrix A we will merge the identity matrix 
to the right of
A and denote this new matrix by 
.
A 
I2
Now we use elementary row operations in a manner similar to the Gaussian elimination
method. The goal is to produce
I2
A-1
In this form, the inverse matrix is the matrix that is to the right of the identity matrix. That is,
To find 
, we use a series of elementary row operations, beginning with one that
will result in a 1 in the first row and the first column. Each elementary row operation is
chosen to advance the process of transforming the original matrix into the identity matrix.

A singular matrix is a matrix that does not have a multiplicative inverse. A matrix that
has a multiplicative inverse is a nonsingular matrix. As you apply elementary row opera-
tions to a singular matrix, there will come a point at which there are all zeros in a row of
the original matrix. When that condition exists, the original matrix does not have an inverse.
EXAMPLE 2
Identify a Singular Matrix
Show that the matrix 
is a singular matrix.
Solution
There are zeros in a row of the original matrix. The original matrix does not have an
inverse.

Integrating Technology
The inverse of a matrix can be found by using a graphing calculator. Enter and store
the matrix in, say, [A]. To compute the inverse of A, use the 
key. For instance, let
. A typical calculator display of the inverse of A is shown in Figure 10.9a.
Because the elements of the matrix are decimals, it is possible to see only the first
column of the inverse matrix. Use the arrow keys to see the remaining columns.
Another possibility for viewing the inverse of A is to use the function on your
calculator that converts a decimal to a fraction. This will change the decimals to
fractions, as in Figure 10.9b.

Note
The disadvantage of using the
inverse matrix method to solve a
system of equations is that this
method will not work if the sys-
tem is dependent or inconsistent.
In addition, this method cannot
distinguish between inconsistent
and dependent systems. However,
in some applications this method
is efficient. See the material on
input–output analysis later in this
section.

The temperature distribution on a metal plate can be approximated by a system of
equations. The idea is based on the assumption that the temperature of a point P on the
plate is the average of the temperatures of the four given points nearest P.

INVERSE OF A MATRIX
Input–Output Analysis
The advantage of using the inverse matrix to solve a system of equations is not apparent
unless it is necessary to solve repeatedly a system of equations with the same coefficient
matrix but different constant matrices. Input–output analysis is one such application of this
method.
In an economy, some of the output of an industry is used by the industry to produce
its own product. For example, an electric company uses water and electricity to produce
electricity, and a water company uses water and electricity to produce drinking water.
Input–output analysis attempts to determine the necessary output of industries to satisfy
each other’s demands plus the demands of consumers. Wassily Leontief, a Harvard econ-
omist, was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work in this field.
An input–output matrix is used to express the interdependence among industries in
an economy. Each column of this matrix gives the dollar values of the inputs an industry
needs to produce $1 worth of output.
To illustrate these concepts, we will assume an economy with only three industries:
agriculture, transportation, and oil. Suppose that the production of $1 worth of agricultural
products requires $0.05 worth of agriculture, $0.02 worth of transportation, and $0.05
worth of oil. The production of $1 worth of transportation requires $0.10 worth of agricul-
ture, $0.08 worth of transportation, and $0.10 worth of oil. The production of $1 worth of
oil requires $0.10 worth of agriculture, $0.15 worth of transportation, and $0.13 worth of
oil. The input–output matrix A is
Input requirements of
Consumers (other than the industries themselves) want to purchase some of the out-
put from these industries. The amount of output that the consumer will want is called the
final demand on the economy. This is represented by a column matrix.
Suppose in our example that the final demand is $3 billion worth of agriculture,
$1 billion worth of transportation, and $2 billion worth of oil. The final demand matrix is
We represent the total output of each industry (in billions of dollars) as follows:
The object of input–output analysis is to determine the values of x, y, and z that will
satisfy the amount the consumer demands. To find these values, consider agriculture. The
amount of agriculture left for the consumer (demand d ) is
To find the amount of agriculture used by the three industries in our economy, refer to the
input–output matrix. Production of x billion dollars worth of agriculture takes 0.05x of
d = x - (amount of agriculture used by industries)

z = total output of oil
y = total output of transportation
x = total output of agriculture

agriculture, production of y billion dollars worth of transportation takes 0.10y of agricul-
ture, and production of z billion dollars worth of oil takes 0.10z of agriculture. Thus
Combining Equation (1) and Equation (2), we have
• d is $3 billion for agriculture.
We could continue this way for each of the other industries. The result would be a system
of equations. Instead, however, we will use a matrix approach.
If 
total output of the three industries of the economy, then
The product of A, the input–output matrix, and X is
This matrix represents the dollar amounts of products used in production for all three
industries. Thus the amount available for consumer demand is 
As a matrix equa-
tion, we can write
Solving this equation for X, we determine the output necessary to meet the needs of our
industries and the consumer.
• I is the identity matrix. Thus IX  X.
• Right distributive property
• Assuming the inverse of (I  A) exists
The last equation states that the solution to an input–output problem can be found by
multiplying the demand matrix D by the inverse of 
In our example, we have

$0.20 worth of coal, $0.03 worth of iron, and $0.12 worth of
steel. Production of $1 worth of steel requires $0.15 worth of
coal, $0.25 worth of iron, and $0.05 worth of steel. How much

of $30 million worth of coal, $5 million worth of iron, and

40. Input–Output Analysis A conglomerate has three divisions:
plastics, semiconductors, and computers. For each $1 worth of
output, the plastics division needs $0.01 worth of plastics,
$0.03 worth of semiconductors, and $0.10 worth of computers.
Each $1 worth of output of the semiconductor division requires
$0.08 worth of plastics, $0.05 worth of semiconductors, and
$0.15 worth of computers. For each $1 worth of output, the
computer division needs $0.20 worth of plastics, $0.20 worth
of semiconductors, and $0.10 worth of computers. The con-
glomerate estimates consumer demand of $100 million worth
from the plastics division, $75 million worth from the semi-
conductor division, and $150 million worth from the computer
division. At what level should each division produce to satisfy
this demand?

Minors and Cofactors
To define the determinant of a matrix of order greater than 2, we first need two other def-
initions.
Definition of the Minor of a Matrix
The minor
of the element 
of a square matrix A of order 
is the deter-
minant of the matrix of order 
obtained by deleting the ith row and the jth
column of A.
Consider the matrix 
The minor 
is the determinant of the 
matrix A formed by deleting row 2 and column 3 from A.
•
The minor 
is the determinant of the matrix A formed by deleting row 3 and column 1
from A.
•
The second definition we need is that of the cofactor of a matrix.

of the element 
of a square matrix A is given by

Evaluating a Determinant Using Expanding 
by Cofactors
Cofactors are used to evaluate the determinant of a matrix of order 3 or greater. The
technique used to evaluate a determinant by using cofactors is called expanding by
cofactors.
Evaluating Determinants by Expanding by Cofactors
Given the square matrix A of order 3 or greater, the value of the determinant of A
is the sum of the products of the elements of any row or column and their cofac-
tors. For the rth row of A, the value of the determinant of A is
For the cth column of A, the determinant of A is
This theorem states that the value of a determinant can be found by expanding by
cofactors of any row or column. The value of the determinant is the same in each case.
To illustrate the method, consider the matrix

Row Operations
Effects of Elementary Row Operations on the Value of a
Determinant of a Matrix
If A is a square matrix of order n, then the following elementary row operations
produce the indicated changes in the determinant of A.
1. Interchanging any two rows of A changes the sign of 
.
2. Multiplying a row of A by a constant k multiplies the determinant of A by k.
3. Adding a multiple of a row of A to another row does not change the value of
the determinant of A.
To illustrate these properties, consider the matrix 
The determinant of
A is
Now consider each of the elementary row operations.
Interchange the rows of A and evaluate the determinant.
Multiply row 2 of A by 
and evaluate the determinant.
Multiply row 1 of A by 
and add it to row 2. Then evaluate the determinant.
These elementary row operations are often used to rewrite a matrix in triangular form.
A matrix is in triangular form if all elements below or above the main diagonal are zero.
The matrices

Math Matters
There is a vast difference between
evaluating the determinant of a
matrix by cofactors and doing so
by row reduction. For instance,
approximately 
opera-
tions are necessary to evaluate a
determinant of order 15 by cofac-
tors. At 4 million operations per
second, a computer would need
approximately 11 days to evaluate
the determinant. On the other
hand, approximately 2000 opera-
tions are needed to evaluate the
determinant by row reduction.
Using the same computer, it
would take less than 0.001 second
to evaluate the determinant.

The properties of determinants
stated at the right remain true
when the word row is replaced by
the word column. In that case, we

Now interchange the two identical rows. Then

CRAMER’S RULE
To solve this system of equations, we extend the concepts behind finding the solution of a
system of two linear equations. The solution of the system has the form 
where
The determinant 
is the determinant of the coefficient matrix. The determinants 
and 
are the determinants of the matrices formed by replacing the first, second, and third
columns, respectively, by the constants. For the original system,

The solution of System (1) is

, where
and D is the determinant of the coefficient matrix,

is the determinant
formed by replacing the ith column of the coefficient matrix with the column of
constants 
.
Because the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be nonzero for us to use
Cramer’s Rule, this method is not appropriate for systems of linear equations with no solu-
tion or infinitely many solutions. In fact, the only time a system of linear equations has a
unique solution is when the determinant of the coefficient matrix is not zero, a fact sum-
marized in the following theorem.

Systems of Linear Equations with Unique Solutions
A system of n linear equations in n variables has a unique solution if and only if
the determinant of the coefficient matrix is not zero.
Cramer’s Rule is also useful when we want to determine the value of only a single
variable in a system of equations.

EXPLORING CONCEPTS WITH TECHNOLOGY

Stochastic Matrices
Matrices can be used to predict how percents of populations will change over time.
Consider two neighborhood supermarkets, Super A and Super B. Each week Super A
loses 5% of its customers to Super B, and each week Super B loses 8% of its customers
to Super A. If this trend continues and if Super A currently has 40% of the neighbor-
hood customers and Super B the remaining 60% of the neighborhood customers, what
percent of the neighborhood customers will each have after n weeks?
We will approach this problem by examining the weekly changes. Because Super
A loses 5% of its customers each week, it retains 95% of its customers. It has 40% of
the neighborhood customers now, so after 1 week it will have 95% of its 40% share, or
38% 
of the customers. In that same week, it gains 8% of the customers of

Super B. Because Super B has 60% of the neighborhood customers, Super A’s gain is
4.8% 
After 1 week, Super A has 
of the neighbor-
hood customers. Super B has the remaining 57.2% of the customers.
The changes for the second week are calculated similarly. Super A retains 95% of
its 42.8% and gains 8% of Super B’s 57.2%. After week 2, Super A has
or approximately 45.2%, of the neighborhood customers. Super B has the remaining 54.8%.
We could continue in this way, but using matrices is a more convenient way 
to proceed. Let 
, where column 1 represents the percent retained 
by Super A and column 2 represents the percent retained by Super B. Let
be the current market shares of Super A and Super B, respectively.
Now form the product 
For the second week, multiply the market share after week 1 by 
The last product can also be expressed as
Note that the exponent on T corresponds to the fact that 2 weeks have passed. In gen-
eral, the market share after n weeks is 
The matrix T is called a stochastic matrix.
A stochastic matrix is characterized by the fact that each element of the matrix is non-
negative and the sum of the elements in each row is 1.
Use a calculator to calculate the market shares of Super A and Super B after 20 weeks,
40 weeks, 60 weeks, and 100 weeks. What observations do you draw from your calcula-
tions? We started this problem with the assumption that Super A had 40% of the market
and Super B had 60% of the market. Suppose, however, that originally Super A had 99%
of the market and Super B had 1%. Does this affect the market share each will have after
100 weeks? If Super A had 1% of the market and Super B had 99% of the market, what
will the market share of each be after 100 weeks?
As another example, suppose each of three department stores is vying for the busi-
ness of the other two stores. In one month, store A loses 15% of its customers to store B
and 8% of its customers to store C. Store B loses 10% of its customers to store A and 12%
to store C. Store C loses 5% to store A and 9% to store B. Assuming these three stores
have 100% of the market and the trend continues, determine what market share each will
have after 100 months.

Investments, Cell Phones, and Medication Doses
The three topics listed in the title may seem at first to have no relationship
to one another, but there is an important link. Each of these topics can be
modeled by a geometric sequence, one of the topics of this chapter. The
following sequence is a geometric sequence.
One interpretation of this sequence is that it gives the value of $100
invested at an annual interest rate of 6%, after 1, 2, 3, 4,
years.
The value of the investment after 4 years is 
Now consider the geometric sequence 
in which each
term after the first is 8/9 times the previous term. One interpretation of this
sequence is shown in the figures above, which begin with a square of area
1 square unit. Divide the square into ninths and remove the small center
square. The area remaining is 8/9 square unit. Now divide each of the
remaining squares into ninths and remove the center square of each. The
remaining area is 64/81 square unit. Continuing this process repeatedly
results in what is called the Sierpinski carpet fractal. Some cell phone
antennas are designed in the configuration of the fourth stage of the fractal.
To see how geometric sequences are used in medication doses, see

Infinite Sequences and Summation Notation
Infinite Sequences
The ordered list of numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32,
is called an infinite sequence. The list is
ordered simply because order makes a difference. The sequence 2, 8, 4, 16, 32,
contains
the same numbers but in a different order. Therefore, it is a different infinite sequence.
An infinite sequence can be thought of as a pairing between positive integers and real
numbers. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36,
,
pairs a positive integer with its square.

This pairing of numbers enables us to define an infinite sequence as a function whose
domain is the positive integers.
Definition of an Infinite Sequence
An infinite sequence is a function whose domain is the positive integers and
whose range is a set of real numbers.
Although the positive integers do not include zero, it is occasionally convenient to include
zero in the domain of an infinite sequence. Also, we will frequently use the word sequence
instead of the phrase infinite sequence.
As an example of a sequence, let 
The range of this function is
,
1,
3,
5,
7,
,
The elements in the range of a sequence are called the terms of the sequence. For our
example, the terms are 1, 3, 5, 7,
, 
. The first term of the sequence is 1, the
second term is 3, and so on. The nth term, or the general term, is
Question • What is the fifth term of the sequence 
?
Rather than use functional notation for sequences, it is customary to use subscript nota-
tion. Thus 
represents the nth term of a sequence. Using this notation, we would write

Math Matters
Recursive subroutines are a part of
many computer programming
languages. One of the most influ-
ential people in the development
of computer languages (especially
COBOL) was Grace Murray
Hooper. She was the first woman
to receive a doctorate in mathe-
matics from Yale University. She
went on to become an admiral in
the U.S. Navy.

Math Matters
The convention of using an excla-
mation point as the factorial sym-
bol was first introduced in 1808 so
that printers setting the type in a
book would not have to write out,
for example, 
but
instead could write 5!. This nota-
tion was not accepted by every-
one, and alternative suggestions
were made. One other notation
was n. Although this angle bracket
saved the printer from writing a
product, it had to be constructed,
whereas the exclamation point was
already in the printer’s tray.

INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SUMMATION NOTATION
From this sequence we can generate a new sequence that is the sum of the terms of
and, in general,
The term 
is called the nth partial sum of the infinite sequence, and the sequence 
, 
is called the sequence of partial sums.
A convenient notation used for partial sums is called summation notation. The sum
of the first n terms of a sequence 
is represented by using the Greek letter 
(sigma).
This sum is called a series. It is a finite series because it is the sum of a finite number of
terms of the sequence. The letter i is called the index of the summation; n is the upper
limit of the summation; 1 is the lower limit of the summation.

sequence or an arithmetic progression. These sequences have the following property: The
difference between successive terms is the same constant. This constant is called the com-
mon difference. For the sequence above, the common difference is 3.

Math Matters
Galileo (1564–1642), using the
fact that the sum of a set of odd
integers is the square of the
number of integers being added
(as shown at the right), was able
to show that objects of different
weights fall at the same rate. By
constructing inclines of various
slopes similar to the one shown
below, with a track in the center
and equal intervals marked
along the incline, he measured
the distance various balls of dif-
ferent weights traveled in equal
intervals of time. He concluded
from his observations that the
distance an object falls is propor-
tional to the square of the time
it takes to fall and does not
depend on its weight. Galileo’s
views were contrary to the pre-
vailing (Aristotelian) theory on
this subject, and he lost his post
at the University of Pisa because
of them.
Adding successive terms of this sequence, we generate a sequence of partial sums. The
sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is called an arithmetic series.
#
#
#
#
#
#
The first five terms of this sequence are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25. It appears from this example that
the sum of the first n odd integers is 
Shortly, we will be able to prove this result by using
the following formula.
Formula for the nth Partial Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence
The nth partial sum of an arithmetic sequence 
is
Proof
Write 
in both forward and reverse order.
Add the two partial sums.

Let d be the common difference of the sequence. Consider the term 
Using the
formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, we have

In a similar manner, we can show that each sum in parentheses in Equation (1) equals

Geometric Sequences
Arithmetic sequences are characterized by a common difference between successive terms.
A geometric sequence is characterized by a common ratio between successive terms.
The sequence
is a geometric sequence. Note that the ratio of any two successive terms is 2.
Definition of a Geometric Sequence
Let r be a nonzero constant real number. A sequence is a geometric sequence if
The number r is called the common ratio.
Consider a geometric sequence in which the first term is 
and the common ratio is
r. By multiplying each successive term of the geometric sequence by the common ratio,
we can derive a formula for the nth term.
Note the relationship between the number of the term and the number that is the exponent
on r. The exponent on r is 1 less than the number of the term. With this observation, we
can write a formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence.
The nth Term of a Geometric Sequence

Applications of Geometric Sequences and Series
Ordinary Annuities
In an earlier chapter, we discussed compound interest by using exponential functions. As
an extension of this idea, suppose that, for each of the next 5 years, P dollars are deposited
on December 31 into an account earning i% annual interest compounded annually. Using
the compound interest formula, we can find the total value of all the deposits. Table 11.2
shows the growth of the investment.
Table 11.2
The total value of the investment after the last deposit, called the future value of the
investment, is the sum of the values of all the deposits.
This is a geometric series with first term P and common ratio 
. Thus, using the for-
mula for the nth partial sum of a geometric sequence,
we have
Deposits of equal amounts at equal intervals of time are called annuities. When the
amounts are deposited at the end of a compounding period (as in our example), we have
an ordinary annuity.

There are many applications of infinite geometric series to the area of finance. Two
such applications are stock valuation and the multiplier effect.
Stock Valuation
The Gordon model of stock valuation, named after Myron Gordon, is used to determine
the value of a stock whose dividend is expected to increase by the same percentage each
year. The value of the stock is given by
where D is the dividend of the stock when it is purchased, g is the expected percent
growth rate of the dividend, and i is the growth rate the investor requires. An example of
stock valuation is given in Example 7.
EXAMPLE 7
Find the Value of a Stock
Suppose a stock is paying a dividend of $1.50 and it is estimated that the dividend will
increase 10% per year. The investor requires a 15% return on an investment. Using the
Gordon model of stock valuation, determine the price per share the investor should pay
for the stock.

Solution
Substitute the given values into the Gordon model.
• D  1.50, g  0.10, i  0.15
The investor should pay $33 per share for the stock.
Try Exercise 76, page 870
If the dividend of a stock does not grow but remains constant, then the formula for the
stock value is
where D is the dividend and i is the investor’s required rate of return. For instance, to find
the value of a stock whose dividend is $2.33 and from which an investor requires a 20%
rate of return, use the formula above with 
and 
The investor should pay $11.65 for each share of stock.
The Multiplier Effect
A phenomenon called the multiplier effect can occur in certain economic situations. We
will examine this effect when applied to a reduction in income taxes.
Suppose the federal government enacts a tax reduction of $5 billion. Suppose also that
an economist estimates that each person receiving a share of this reduction will spend 75%
and save 25%. This means that 75% of $5 billion, or $3.75 billion 
will
be spent. The amount that is spent becomes income for other people, who in turn spend
75% of that amount, or $2.8125 billion 
This money becomes
income for other people, and so on. This process is illustrated in the table below.
(0.75 # 3.75 = 2.8125).
(0.75 # 5 = 3.75),
= 2.33

Note that the values in the middle column form a geometric sequence. The net effect
of all the spending is found by summing an infinite geometric series.
This means that the original tax cut of $5 billion results in actual spending of $20 billion.
Some economists believe this is good for economic growth; others see it as contributing to
inflation and therefore bad for the economy.

73. Medicine The concentration (in milligrams per liter) of an
antibiotic in the blood is given by the geometric series
where A is the number of milligrams in one dose of the antibi-
otic, n is the number of doses, t is the time between doses, and
k is a constant that depends on how quickly the body metabo-
lizes the antibiotic. Suppose one dose of an antibiotic increases
the blood level of the antibiotic by 0.5 milligram per liter. If the
antibiotic is given every 4 hours and 
, find the con-
centration, to the nearest hundredth, of the antibiotic just
before the fifth dose.
74. Medicine To treat some diseases, a patient must have a cer-
tain concentration of a medication in the blood for an extended
period. In such a case, the amount of medication in the blood
can be approximated by the infinite geometric series
where A is the number of milligrams in one dose of the med-
ication, t is the time between doses, and k is a constant that
depends on how quickly the body metabolizes the medication.
If the medication is given every 12 hours, 
, and the
required concentration of medication is 2 milligrams per liter,
find the amount of the dosage. Round your result to the near-
est hundredth of a milligram. (Suggestion: Solve the equation
for A.)

purchases a stock for $67 per share that pays a divided of

growth rate Myna expects.

of stock valuation to determine the price per share the manager
of a mutual fund should pay for a stock whose dividend is

80. Multiplier Effect Sometimes a city will argue that having a
professional sports franchise in the city will contribute to eco-
nomic growth. The rationale for this statement is based on the
multiplier effect. Suppose a city estimates that a professional
sports franchise will create $50 million of additional income and
that a person receiving a portion of this money will spend 90%
and save 10%. Assuming the multiplier effect model is accurate,
what is the net effect of the $50 million? (See pages 868–869.)
81. Multiplier Effect Suppose a city estimates that a new conven-
tion facility will bring $25 million of additional income. If
each person receiving a portion of this money spends 75% and
saves 25%, what is the net effect of the $25 million? (See pages
868–869.)
82. Counterfeit Money Circulation Suppose that $500,000 of
counterfeit money is currently in circulation and that each time
the counterfeit money is used, 40% of it is detected and
removed from circulation. How much counterfeit money, to the
nearest thousand dollars, is used in transactions before all of it
is removed from circulation? This problem represents another
application of the multiplier effect. (See pages 868–869.)

As a second example, consider the conjecture that the expression 
is a
prime number for all positive integers n. To test this conjecture, we will try various values
of n. See Table 11.3. The results suggest that the conjecture is true. But again, how can we

The last example illustrates that just verifying a conjecture for a few values of n does
not constitute a proof of the conjecture. To prove theorems about statements involving pos-
itive integers, a process called mathematical induction is used. This process is based on an
axiom called the induction axiom.

MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION
Induction Axiom
Suppose S is a set of positive integers with the following two properties:
1. 1 is an element of S.
2. If the positive integer k is in S, then 
is in S.
Then S contains all positive integers.
Part 2 of this axiom states that if some positive integer—say, 8—is in S, then 
, or
9, is in S. But because 9 is in S, Part 2 says that 
, or 10, is in S, and so on. Part 1 states
that 1 is in S. Thus 2 is in S; thus 3 is in S; thus 4 is in 
and so on. Therefore, all positive
integers are in S.
Principle of Mathematical Induction
The induction axiom is used to prove the Principle of Mathematical Induction.
Principle of Mathematical Induction
Let 
be a statement about a positive integer n. If
1.
is true and
2. the truth of 
implies the truth of 
then 
is true for all positive integers.
In a proof that uses the Principle of Mathematical Induction, the first part of
Step 2, the truth of Pk, is referred to as the induction hypothesis. When applying this
step, we assume that the statement 
is true (the induction hypothesis), and then we try
to prove that 
is also true.
As an example, we will prove that the first conjecture we made in this section is true
for all positive integers. Every induction proof has the two distinct parts stated in the
Principle of Mathematical Induction. First, we show that the result is true for 
Second, we assume that the statement is true for some positive integer k and, using that
assumption, we prove that the statement is true for 
.

We could continue to build on previous expansions and eventually have quite a compre-
hensive list of binomial expansions. Instead, however, we will look for a theorem that will
enable us to expand 
directly, without multiplying.
Look at the variable parts of each expansion above. Note that for each 
the following statements are true.
The first term is 
The exponent on

The exponent on

The degree of each term is

To find a pattern for the coefficients in each expansion of 
, first note that
there are 
terms and that the coefficient of the first and last term is 1. To find the
remaining coefficients, consider the expansion of 
Observe from these patterns that there is a strong relationship to factorials. In fact, we can
express each coefficient by using factorial notation.
In each denominator, the first factorial is the exponent on , and the second factorial is the
exponent on 
In general, we will conjecture that the coefficient of the term

of

Each coefficient of a term of a binomial expansion is called a
binomial coefficient and is denoted by

Fundamental Counting Principle
Suppose that an electronics store offers a three-component stereo system for $250. A buyer
must choose one amplifier, one tuner, and one pair of speakers. If the store has two mod-
els of amplifiers, three models of tuners, and two speaker models, how many different
stereo systems could a consumer purchase?
This problem belongs to a class of problems called counting problems. The problem
is to determine the number of ways in which the conditions of the problem can be satis-
fied. One way to do this is to make a tree diagram using 
and 
for the amplifiers; 
and 
for the tuners; and 
and 
for the speakers. See Figure 11.2.
By counting the possible systems that can be purchased, we find there are 12 differ-
ent systems. Another way to arrive at this result is to find the product of the numbers of
options available.
In some states, a standard car license plate consists of a nonzero digit, followed by three
letters, followed by three more digits. What is the maximum number of car license plates of

Instead, the following counting principle is used. This principle forms the basis for all
counting problems.
Fundamental Counting Principle
Let
be a sequence of n conditions. Suppose that 
can occur in
ways, 
can occur in 
ways, 
can occur in 
ways, and so on, until finally
can occur in 
ways. Then the number of ways of satisfying the conditions
in succession is given by the product
To apply the Fundamental Counting Principle to the license plate problem, first find
the number of ways each condition can be satisfied, as shown in Table 11.4. Thus we have
Question • Suppose that a license plate begins with two letters. How many different ways could
the license plate begin?

must choose one of three different engines, one of five different colors, and one of four
different interior packages. How many different selections can the customer make?
Solution

Some graphing calculators use
the notation nPr to represent the
number of permutations of n
objects taken r at a time. The
calculation of the number of
permutations of 15 objects taken
4 at a time is shown below.
Consider a race with 10 runners. In how many different orders can the runners finish
first, second, and third (assuming no ties)?
Any one of the 10 runners could finish first:
Any one of the remaining 9 runners could be second:
Any one of the remaining 8 runners could be third:
By the Fundamental Counting Principle, there are 
possible first-, second-,
and third-place finishes for the 10 runners. Using the language of permutations, we would
say, “There are 720 permutations of 10 objects (the runners) taken 3 (the number of pos-
sible finishes) at a time.”
Permutations occur so frequently in counting problems that a formula, rather than the
Fundamental Counting Principle, is often used.

a.
There are six distinct people to place in six distinct positions. Thus

Think of the two people who must sit together as a single object and count the num-
ber of arrangements of the five objects (AB), C, D, E, and F. Thus

There are also 120 arrangements with A and B reversed [(BA), C, D, E, F]. Thus
the total number of arrangements is

From a., there are 720 possible seating arrangements. From b., there are 240 arrange-
ments with two specific people next to each other. Thus there are 
arrangements in which two specific people are not seated together.

Combinations
Up to this point, we have been counting the number of distinct arrangements of objects. In
some cases, we may be interested in determining the number of ways of selecting objects
without regard to the order of the selection. For example, suppose we want to select a com-
mittee of three people from five candidates denoted by 
and 
One possible
committee is 
If we select 
we still have the same committee because the
order of the selection is not important. An arrangement of objects in which the order of the
selection is not important is a combination.

The difficult part of solving a counting problem is determining whether to use the
counting principle, the permutation formula, or the combination formula. Following is a
summary of guidelines.
Guidelines for Solving Counting Problems
1. The Fundamental Counting Principle will always work but is not always the
easiest method to apply.
2. When reading a problem, ask yourself, “Is the order of the selection process
important?” If the answer is yes, the arrangements are permutations. If the
answer is no, the arrangements are combinations.

Many events in the world around us have random character, such as the chances of an acci-
dent occurring on a certain freeway, the chances of winning a state lottery, and the chances
that the nucleus of an atom will undergo fission. By repeatedly observing such events, it
is often possible to recognize certain patterns. Probability is the mathematical study of
random patterns.
When a weather reporter predicts a 30% chance of rain, the forecaster is saying that
similar weather conditions have led to rain 30 times out of 100. When a fair coin is tossed,
we expect heads to occur 
or 50%, of the time. The numbers 30% (or 0.3) and 
are the
probabilities of the events.
Sample Spaces and Events
An activity with an observable outcome is called an experiment. Examples of experiments
include
1. Flipping a coin and observing the side facing upward
2. Observing the incidence of a disease in a certain population
3. Observing the length of time a person waits in a checkout line in a grocery store
The sample space of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment.

Math Matters
The beginning of probability the-
ory is frequently associated with
letters sent between Pascal (of
Pascal’s Triangle) and Fermat (of
Fermat’s Last Theorem) in which
they discuss the solution of a
problem posed to them by
Antoine Gombaud, Chevalier de
Mere, a French aristocrat who
liked to gamble. The basic ques-
tion was “How many tosses of two
dice are necessary to have a better
than 50–50 chance of rolling two
sixes?” Although the correct
analysis of this problem by Fermat
and Pascal presaged probability
theory, historical records indicate
that commerce and the need to
insure ships, cargo, and lives was
another motivating factor to cal-
culating probabilities. The first
merchant insurance companies
were established in the fourteenth
century to insure ships. Life insur-
ance companies were established
at the end of the seventeenth cen-
tury. Lloyd’s of London was estab-
lished sometime before 1690.
five pairs. In how many ways will each pair consist of a long
stick and a short stick? (This exercise actually has a practical
side. When cells are exposed to harmful radiation, some chro-
mosomes break. If two long sides unite or two short sides unite,
the cell dies.)
52. Arranging Numbers Four random digits are drawn (repeti-
tions are allowed). Among the four digits, in how many ways
can two or more repetitions occur?
53. Random Walk An aimless tourist, standing on a street corner,
tosses a coin. If the result is heads, the tourist walks one block
north. If the result is tails, the tourist walks one block south. At
the new corner, the coin is tossed again and the same rule
applied. If the coin is tossed 10 times, in how many ways will
the tourist be back at the original corner? This problem is an
elementary example of what is called a random walk. Random
walk problems have many applications in physics, chemistry,
and economics.

INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY
Consider the experiment of tossing one coin three times and recording the outcome of
the upward side of the coin for each toss. The sample space is
EXAMPLE 1
List the Elements of a Sample Space
Suppose that among five batteries, two are defective. Two batteries are randomly drawn
from the five and tested for defects. List the elements in the sample space.
Solution
Label the nondefective batteries 
, 
, and 
and the defective batteries 
and 
.
The sample space is

N1D1, N2D1, N3D1, N1D2, N2D2, N3D2, N1N2, N1N3, N2N3, D1D2
Try Exercise 6, page 897
An event E is any subset of a sample space. For the sample space defined in Example 1,
several of the events we could define are
There are no defective batteries.
At least one battery is defective.
Both batteries are defective.
Because an event is a subset of the sample space, each of these events can be expressed as
a set.
E1 =
N1N2, N1N3, N2N3
E2 =
N1D1, N2D1, N3D1, N1D2, N2D2, N3D2, D1D2
E3 =
D1D2
There are two methods by which elements can be drawn from a set: with replacement
and without replacement. With replacement means that after the element is drawn, it is
returned to the set. The same element could be selected on the next drawing. When ele-
ments are drawn without replacement, an element drawn is not returned to the set and
therefore is not available for any subsequent drawing.

INTRODUCTION TO PROBABILITY
The expression “one or the other of two events occurs” is written as the union of the two
sets. For example, suppose an experiment leads to the sample space 
and the events are
Draw a number less than four, 
Draw an even number, 
Then the event 
is described by drawing a number less than four or an even num-
ber. Thus
Two events 
and 
that cannot occur at the same time are mutually exclusive
events. Using set notation, if 
then 
and 
are mutually exclusive.
For example, using the same sample space 
a third event is
Draw an odd number, 
Then
and the events 
and 
are mutually exclusive. On the other hand,
so the events 
and 
are not mutually exclusive.
One of the axioms of probability involves the union of mutually exclusive events.

EXAMPLE 5
Use Counting Principles to Calculate a Probability
A state lottery game allows a person to choose five numbers from the integers 1 to 40.
Repetitions of numbers are not allowed. If three or more numbers match the numbers
chosen by the lottery, the player wins a prize. Find the probability that a player will
match the following.
a.
Exactly three numbers
b.
Exactly four numbers
Solution
The sample space S is the set of ways in which 5 numbers can be chosen from 40 num-
bers. This is a combination because the order of the drawing is not important.
We will call the 5 numbers chosen by the state lottery “lucky” and the remaining
35 numbers “unlucky.”
a.
Let 
be the event that a player has 3 lucky and therefore 2 unlucky numbers. The
3 lucky numbers are chosen from the 5 lucky numbers. There are 
ways to
do this. The 2 unlucky numbers are chosen from the 35 unlucky numbers. There
are 
ways to do this. By the fundamental counting principle, the number of
ways the event 
can occur is

Independent Events
Two events are independent if the outcome of the first event does not influence the out-
come of the second event. As an example, consider tossing a fair coin twice. The outcome
of the first toss has no bearing on the outcome of the second toss. The two events are inde-
pendent.
Now consider drawing two cards in succession, without replacement, from a standard
deck of playing cards. The probability that the second card drawn will be an ace depends
on the card drawn first.
Probability Rule for Independent Events
If 
and 
are two independent events, then the probability that both 
and
will occur is
EXAMPLE 6
Calculate a Probability for Independent Events
A coin is tossed and then a die is rolled. What is the probability that the coin will show
a head and the die will show a six?
Solution
The events are independent because the outcome of one does not influence the outcome
of the other. 
and 
. Thus the probability of tossing a head and
rolling a six is

Binomial Probabilities
Some probabilities can be calculated from formulas. One of the most important of these
formulas is the binomial probability formula. This formula is used to calculate probabili-
ties for independent events.

Binomial Probability Formula
Let an experiment consist of n independent trials for which the probability of suc-
cess on a single trial is p and the probability of failure is 
. Then the
probability of k successes in n trials is given by
EXAMPLE 7
Use the Binomial Formula
A multiple-choice exam consists of 10 questions. For each question there are four pos-
sible choices, of which only one is correct. If someone randomly guesses at the
answers, what is the probability of guessing exactly six answers correctly?
Solution
Selecting an answer is one trial of the experiment. Because there are 10 questions, 
.
There are four possible choices for each question, of which only one is correct. Therefore,
A success for this experiment occurs each time a correct answer is guessed. Thus
By the binomial probability formula,
The probability of guessing exactly six answers correctly is approximately 0.0162.

Guidelines for Calculating a Probability
1. The word or usually means to add the probabilities of each event.
2. The word and usually means to multiply the probabilities of each event.
3. The phrase at least n means n or more. At least 5 is 5 or more.
4. The phrase at most n means n or less. At most 5 is 5 or less.
5. Exactly n means just that. Exactly five heads in seven tosses of a coin means
five heads and therefore two tails.

Airlines “overbook” flights. That
is, they sell more tickets than
there are seats on the plane. An
airline company can determine
the probability that some number
of passengers will be “bumped”
on a certain flight by using the
binomial probability formula. For
instance, suppose a plane has
200 seats and the airline sells
240 tickets. If the probability that
a person will show up for this
flight is 0.8, then the probability
that one or more people will have
to be bumped is given by
A computer calculation reveals
that this sum is approximately
0.08. That is, there is only an 8%
chance that someone will have to
be bumped, even though the
number of tickets sold exceeds
the plane’s capacity by 20%.

Mathematical Expectation
Expectation E is a number used to determine the fairness of a gambling game. It is
defined as the probability P of winning a bet multiplied by the amount A available to win.
A game is called fair if the expectation of the game equals the amount bet. For
example, if you and a friend each bet $1 on who can guess the side facing up on the
flip of a coin, then the expectation is 
Because the amount of your 
bet equals the expectation, the game is fair.
When a game is unfair, it benefits one of the players. If you bet $1 and your friend 
bets $2 on who can guess the flip of a coin, your expectation is 
Because your expectation is greater than the amount you bet, the game is advantageous
to you. Your friend’s expectation is also $1.50, which is less than the amount your
friend bet. This is a disadvantage to your friend.
Keno is a game of chance played in many casinos. In this game, a large basket
contains 80 balls numbered from 1 to 80. From these balls, the dealer randomly
chooses 20 balls. The number of ways in which the dealer can choose 20 balls from
80 is the number of combinations of 80 objects chosen 20 at a time, or 
In one particular game, a gambler can bet $1 and mark five numbers. The gambler
will win a prize if three of the five numbers marked are included in the 20 numbered
balls chosen by the dealer. By the Fundamental Counting Principle, there are
ways the gambler can do this. The probability of this 
event is 
The amount the gambler wins for this event is $2 
(the $1 bet plus $1 from the casino), so the expectation of the gambler is approximately
0.0839 # $2 = $0.17.

51. Spread of a Rumor A club has nine members. One member
starts a rumor by telling it to a second club member, who
repeats the rumor to a third member, and so on. At each stage,
the recipient of the rumor is chosen at random from the nine
club members. What is the probability that the rumor will be
told three times without returning to the originator?
52. Extrasensory Perception As a test for extrasensory percep-
tion (ESP), 10 cards, five black and five white, are shuffled,
and then a person looks at each card. In another room, the ESP
subject attempts to guess whether the card is black or white.
The ESP subject must guess black five times and white five
times. If the ESP subject has no extrasensory perception, what
is the probability that the subject will correctly name 8 of the
10 cards?
53. Sports In some games, such as tennis, the winning player must
win by at least two points. If a game is tied, play is continued
until one player wins two consecutive points. It can be shown
that the probability of Player A winning two consecutive points
after a game is tied is given by the infinite geometric series
where p is the probability that Player A will win any particular
point. Suppose the probability that you will win a particular
point is 0.55 (that is, 
). What is the probability that
you will go on to win a game that is presently tied? Round to
the nearest thousandth.
54. Gambling One way that a player can win in a game of craps
is to bet that, when two dice are rolled, a sum of 6 will occur
before a sum of 7 occurs. The probability of this outcome is

Each casino has different rules and different methods of awarding prizes. The
tables below give the prizes for a $2 bet for some of the possible choices a gambler can
make at four casinos. In each case, the Mark column indicates how many numbers the
gambler marked, and the Catch column shows how many of the numbers marked by the
gambler were also chosen by the dealer. Complete the Expectation columns.
Adding the expectations in each column gives you the total expectation for marking
six numbers. Find the total expectation for each casino. Which casino offers the gambler
the greatest expectation?

14. We need to solve triangle ABC, given A  54.32°, a  24.42,
and c  16.92. Use the Law of Sines to find the measure of
angle C.
There are two angles C, where C is between 0° and 180°,
such that 
One of the angles is an acute angle, and the other is an obtuse
angle. The inverse sine function can be used to find the acute
angle.
The obtuse angle is the supplement of 34.25°, which is 
180°  34.25°  145.75°. We can determine that the 145.75°
value for C is not a valid result, because A  54.32° and the
sum of 54.32° and 145.75° is greater than 180°. (The sum of
the measures of the angles in any triangle is 180°.) Thus, the
only possibility for C is C

the measure of angle B.

There are two angles A, where A is between 0° and 180°,
