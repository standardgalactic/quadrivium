Introduction

elcome to Piano & Keyboard All-In-One For Dummies! You hold in your 
hands a well-rounded compendium of tips and advice about playing 
piano and other keyboard instruments, including electronic keyboards.
If you’ve never seen or put your hands on a piano or keyboard, no problem. 
This book starts at the very beginning and walks you through everything you 
need to know to tame that beast and make it sing sweet music. You’ll also 
have fun along the way. That’s the whole idea.
Maybe you have a little experience — like, say, maybe you were ­“encouraged” 
to take piano lessons as a youngster but are just now actually becoming inter­
ested in playing as an adult. Or maybe you poke around on your grandma’s 
upright, or you got a Casio keyboard for your last birthday, and you want to 
start taking your playing a little more seriously. You too are in the right place. 
Or perhaps you’re not bad on piano but are thinking of digging in to your 
wallet to buy a fancy new synthesizer or arranger keyboard, but aren’t sure 
you can deal with the complicated-looking technology. This book can help 
you, too.
Basically, there’s a whole lot here for anyone interested in playing piano or 
keyboards or taking their playing to the next level.
About This Book
Piano & Keyboard All-In-One For Dummies covers a wide range of topics, 
ranging all the way from what a quarter note is and how to find middle C, to 
breaking down the 12-bar blues structure, to hooking your keyboard up to 
your music player so you can jam out to your favorite tunes on headphones.
The chapters in Book I focus on getting to know the instrument — how to find 
a good, affordable one, what to look for, how to maintain it, and basically 
how it works and the best ways to play it. Book II turns to the fundamentals of 
music itself, with chapters covering how music breaks down into notes and 
rests, how to read sheet music, and how to keep up with beats and rhythm. 
Book III brings all that together and introduces scales, melodies, harmonies, 
keys and key signatures, and chords.

2
Piano & Keyboard All-In-One For Dummies 
Book IV starts getting into more fancy stuff, like how to add flair to your ­playing, 
how to turn your left hand into your favorite accompanist, and what defines dif­
ferent classical and pop music forms. It also offers great tips on playing all kinds 
of music on piano and keyboard. Book V is all about practice. As with anything, 
playing piano and keyboard do require dedication and repetition — it is, after 
all, the way to Carnegie Hall — but these chapters try to keep things as fun as 
possible while refining your skills. Book VI is all about electronic keyboards, how 
to choose one, how to find out what it can do and get the most out of it, and 
how to take advantage of its more complex ­features. The book ­finishes with a 
guide to the free online music tracks that are sprinkled throughout this book. 
Listening to these tracks can speed up your understanding and help sharpen your 
playing skills.
The book also contains an absolute ton of music. You’ll have plenty — 
­plen-tee — of songs and snippets to play and have fun with. And a lot of it is 
­available for listening on the free online audio tracks.
Within this book, you may note that some web addresses break across two 
lines of text. If you’re reading this book in print and want to visit one of 
these web pages, simply key in the web address exactly as it’s noted in 
the text, pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist. If you’re reading 
this as an e-book, you’ve got it easy — just tap the web address to be taken 
directly to the web page.
Foolish Assumptions
This books makes a few assumptions about you, the reader:
	
✓	You like to listen to music and especially like the sound of piano and 
keyboard.
	
✓	When you hear someone play the piano, it sparks something in you. You 
say to yourself something like, “I wish I could play like that.”
	
✓	You haven’t had any piano lessons before, or you had some lessons at 
some point in your life, but you basically see yourself as a beginner. 
Either way, you’d like it all laid out and explained in a simple and easy-
to-understand way.
	
✓	You have a piano or keyboard but aren’t playing it as much as you want 
to and need some help getting to the music making.
	
✓	You don’t have a piano or keyboard but are considering a purchase and 
would welcome help with the whole process. Most likely, your keyboard 
will have at least 25 black and white keys, may or may not plug into the 
wall, and will cost you as much as you’re willing to part with.
	
✓	You like to discover things for yourself.
If any of these assumptions is true for you, you’re reading the right book.

There’s an occasional step into the swamp of technical jargon or complex dis­
cussion, and this icon gives you fair warning. It’s not essential stuff. Feel free 
to flip past it if you just don’t care.
	
Pay attention to text featuring this icon. It can help you avoid mistakes and 
problems.

Piano & Keyboard All-In-One For Dummies 
Finally, www.dummies.com/go/pianokeyboardaio is home to the more 
than 150 audio tracks that accompany this book. Head there to listen to 
notes, scales, chords, songs, exercises, demonstrations of the sounds of 
instruments and various keyboard features, and much more.
Where to Go from Here
The book is organized into parts containing chapters that are grouped 
according to broad, related topics. But you sure don’t have to read it from 
front to back — or in any particular order. The idea is that you can skim 
through the table of contents and pick and choose whatever’s interesting 
to you, based on where you are currently in your musical journey. Then go 
directly to that section and get cracking.
Still, if you really want some tips about where to begin, here are a few: If 
you’ve never touched a piano before, definitely start with Book I. If looking at 
printed music gives you heart palpitations, you really should think about 
heading to Book II. If you’re okay on the very basics, try Book III, where you 
gain knowledge of important piano-playing fundamentals and techniques. If 
you’re not too bad at playing but would like to dig deeper into some particu­
lar styles, like rock, country, or jazz, head to Book IV. If you’re pretty good 
but could use some terrific warmups to get your fingers even more limber 
(limberer?), try Book V. And if you’ve got your hot little hands on a smokin’ 
new keyboard or synthesizer and want to delve into its possibilities, head 
on over to Book VI.
Bottom line: Every person’s musical journey is unique. Wherever you 
start — or end up — the important thing is to have fun (and keep playing!).

T

he piano remains a very popular instrument, with the number of people 
who love the piano growing and its popularity spreading throughout the 
world. Even as the piano is treasured for its quality as an instrument, it also 
adapts itself to the changing times through technological advances.
The first half of this chapter helps you understand what makes the piano 
so unique and what’s involved in learning to play it. You may find out that 
you know a lot more about music than you thought you did, even if you’re a 
beginner. Beyond the familiar black and white keys, though, keyboards can 
be wildly different instruments, and looking at the front panels may not give 
you much of a clue as to what’s inside. The second half of this chapter gives 
you an overview of what keyboards are and just what you can do with them.
What’s So Special About the Piano?
Playing the piano involves the following fundamental musical tasks:
	
✓	Playing different pitches and melodies
	
✓	Controlling the attack and release of a note
	
✓	Playing different dynamics (relative loudness and softness)

8
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
But playing the piano is different from playing other instruments in some 
important respects, and the piano has several attributes that make it an ideal 
tool for learning and understanding music.
Advantages to playing the piano
The piano occupies a central position in the world of music. It’s the gold 
standard of musical instruments, utilized by composers and arrangers and 
featured routinely in nearly all musical styles, in chamber groups, rock bands, 
and jazz trios. (Okay, not marching bands.) The following characteristics 
make the piano a unique instrument — in a great way:
	
✓	You can play many different notes at the same time. The fancy word 
for this is polyphonic.
	
✓	It’s a complete solo instrument. You can play a complete song or other 
musical work without additional accompaniment or other help from 
your musical friends. That makes the piano satisfying and self-sufficient.
	
✓	It’s the perfect accompaniment. You can accompany a singer, a choir, 
a dance class, a silent movie, your own opera, or your own soap opera, 
not to mention any other instrument.
	
✓	You can play almost anything on the piano. The piano has an unmatched 
repertoire of music. You name it, there’s piano music for it.
Advantages to learning music at the piano
The piano is an ideal instrument for learning all about music, starting with 
the design of the keyboard. The notes are laid out before your very eyes in a 
clear, organized, and orderly way. Understanding and playing musical pitches 
is quite easy because the keyboard presents a clear visual image for your 
brain to process the way musical notes go up (higher pitch), down (lower 
pitch), or stay the same.
Each key on the keyboard produces a single, distinct pitch, and you can’t 
beat that for simplicity. Not much skill is required to make a nice, musical 
sound. Compared with some other instruments (cello, violin, clarinet, trom­
bone, trumpet, bassoon, oboe, and tuba), playing any key on the keyboard, 
no matter how high or low the pitch, is as easy as playing any other key.
Another advantage of the piano is that you can play chords and layer sounds. 
The keyboard makes it easy to play harmonies and immediately hear how a 
combination of notes sounds.

A skill and an art
After all is said and done, the reason playing piano is so special may be that 
it’s an activity that invites your full participation and rewards you just as 
completely. It has its mental side and its physical side. It requires both cre­
ativity and discipline, and engaging your mind and body is deeply satisfying.
As you learn to read music and play the notes on the piano (or keyboard, for 
that matter), you create information loops from your brain throughout your 
body. The first loop is from your eyes to your brain, as you take in the notes 
on the page and process the information. In the second loop, your brain 
sends signals to your hands and fingers, telling them how and where to move. 
Your fingers start to develop a sense of what it feels like to move around the 
keyboard and use different kinds of touch to produce different results from 
the piano. A third loop is made as your ears hear the sound from the instru­
ment and send information back to your brain for it to process: Did I play 
the right notes and rhythms? Did I play a note too loudly or softy? Does what 
I play sound musical, overall? All this information helps you to modify the 
­signals you send throughout your body to improve the results.
This full-sensory experience is paired with an interpretive element, as your 
inner artist is at work. The notes and directions on the page can only go so 
far in describing how the music should sound, which is why two pianists 
playing the same piece will create noticeably different performances. Even 
two performances by the same pianist will come out differently. Playing the 
piano lets you be the decider when you make music: how fast, how slow, how 
much more, how much less, how many encores to give your audience.
The combination of executing skills and interpreting the music is something 
that happens each time you play. Even when you simply play what’s written, 
your personal interpretation comes through. With the piano, you’re a musician 
from day one.
Why People Learn to Play the Piano 
(and Why They Often Quit)
Many people start taking piano lessons as kids, when they don’t have much 
say in the matter. But adults come to the piano for many reasons, including 
wanting to take it up again because it didn’t stick the first time around, when 
they were kids. Following are some reasons you may want to learn or relearn 
to play piano:

10
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
✓	You want to re-create your favorite songs and compositions. When you 
play a piece of music on the piano, you bring that music to life. Written 
music is like a blueprint — a set of directions that tell you what notes to 
play and when and how to play them. It takes a performer to complete 
the process that starts in the composer’s mind but is unfulfilled until the 
music reaches the listener’s ear.
	
✓	You like a challenge. There’s no doubt that getting to the intermediate 
and advanced levels of piano takes time, patience, and practice. Some 
people relish this challenge. Whatever your ambition, learning to play 
piano is a never-ending challenge given the wealth of material at all levels. 
Some people set goals for themselves — to learn a certain piece they 
want to be able to play, or to be able to play piano for others at a party 
or family gathering. There are plenty of rewards to be had along the way, 
and sticking with it pays off when you start playing your favorite songs or 
when you get the chance to play music with others. There’s nothing like 
being able to say, “I’m with the band.”
	
✓	You want to be able to play music in almost any style. Playing a pop 
song or a classical sonata on piano doesn’t require a different set of notes; 
when you know how to read and play piano music, you can play classical, 
jazz, rock, country, folk, cabaret, Broadway show tunes, and more. If you 
can play piano, you can speak the universal language of music.
Unfortunately, failure to quickly reach any of these goals leads some to throw 
in the towel. It’s important to be realistic with your timetable and your expec­
tations as you begin learning piano. Here are some top reasons why people 
give up playing the piano; don’t let yourself fall victim to them, too:
	
✓	Frustration: Learning to play the piano takes patience. Coordinating 
hands and fingers, reading music, and committing to practice, practice, 
practice are the refrain of musicians everywhere, but making it all fun is 
the goal of this book.
	
✓	No time: Getting yourself to a basic beginner level of piano doesn’t 
require hours and hours of keyboard work every day. Regular practice 
sessions in which you can focus and learn comfortably do wonders 
for improvement.
	
✓	Self-criticism: No doubt you’re your own worst critic, and nobody likes 
playing wrong notes. Short-circuit your inner critic by celebrating small 
achievements and show off to your friends and family along the way so 
they can support you.

Getting to Know the Piano 
as an Instrument
The first step in learning to play the piano is familiarizing yourself with your 
instrument. The piano is a complex and fascinating contraption, and the 
modern piano reflects hundreds of years of developments and improvements 
in design and sound.
A prospective buyer has plenty of options when approaching the piano 
market today. The two styles of acoustic piano, grand and upright, come in 
a variety of sizes and prices, and both produce sound in a similar way. Their 
hammer action design allows you to control the volume and tone quality 
through the speed and nuance of your touch as you press down a key and 
send a felt-covered wooden hammer to strike a string, or set of strings, inside 
the piano. The resonance of the string vibrating is amplified by the wooden 
soundboard, which is parallel to the strings.
The wide range of digital keyboards available today offers some attractive 
alternatives to acoustic pianos, even if they fall short of capturing the sound 
and feel of the real thing. Digital pianos use sampled sounds — of pianos, 
electric pianos, harpsichords, and organs, as well as other instruments and 
sound effects — that are stored as digital information. You play these sounds 
by pressing a key and hearing the sound amplified electronically. Digital 
keyboards (covered later in this chapter) put a greatly expanded library of 
sound at your fingertips. Other advantages of digital pianos and keyboards 
include greater portability and “silent” practicing with headphones.
The hybrid piano combines acoustic and digital technology and is another 
enticing option available today. Though expensive, these pianos are well on 
their way to fulfilling their promise to combine the best of both worlds.
Check out the rest of the chapters in Book I to find out more about all the key­
board instruments, compare styles and designs, prepare yourself to go piano or 
keyboard shopping, and find out how to care for your instrument at home.
The piano did not grow obsolete with the development of electronic instruments 
in the last 50 years. The piano is popular in both its old-fashioned acoustic ver­
sion and all the newer versions that feature digital sound; automatic playing 
features; and recording, editing, and web-integration technology. In other words, 
pianos are the best of both worlds these days, and no one needs to compromise 
if they don’t want to. The piano has adapted and changed with the times, yet it’s 
still treasured for the fundamental things that haven’t changed. It’s still an ideal 
solo instrument to have at home, it’s ready to be played whenever the mood 
strikes you, and its intuitive design satisfies both your fingers and your ears.

Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
Understanding the Language of Music
Playing the piano or keyboard means reading music. The best thing to keep in 
mind is that, in a way, you already know the language. You’ve heard it, sung it, 
danced to it, and gone to beddy-bye to it your whole life. If you haven’t read 
music before, think of it as assigning new names and concepts to things you 
already know and making connections from the new language to the language 
you’ve already learned aurally.
Reading music means reading pitches, rhythms, and other notational sym­
bols invented to communicate music from composer to performer. See the 
table of contents to find the chapters in this book that cover these topics.
	
When you know how to read music, you can play most any song or other musical 
composition written at the beginner level, no matter the style of music.
Perhaps you can pick up simple melodies by ear and hunt and peck with a few 
fingers to play the notes, but eventually you’re going to want to develop your 
skills more. Learning to read musical notation opens up a way to communicate 
so much about playing any type of keyboard. It allows you to read the examples 
in this book and others; to buy sheet music and songbooks of your favorite 
piano pieces, artists, and songs; and to tackle instructional courses.
Some forms of print music use what are called chord symbols to indicate notes 
that can be played beneath a melody. They’re usually intended for guitar 
players to strum along, but the keyboardist can also use them to enhance 
playing. A form of print music called a fake book provides only a melody and 
chord symbols, so you need to know your chords to follow along with those.
Coordinating mind and body
At the heart of playing the piano is movement. 
The subtle movements required to play piano or 
keyboard may not be as big as those required 
of ballet or swimming, but they’re numerous. 
As a result, playing piano involves lots of coor­
dination, which is where practice comes into 
the picture.
Playing while you read involves counting, read­
ing, and responding. You achieve a smooth 
choreography as you coordinate your mind and 
body and continually isolate and integrate your 
hands and fingers and the melody and the har­
mony. You may start by playing a melody in your 
right hand, adding a left-hand part when your 
right hand is secure, and adding facility as you 
go. Keep in mind that it’s normal and necessary 
to progress by taking one step back and two 
steps forward.

Developing an ear for horizontal 
and vertical music
Among the challenges and rewards of learning piano are understanding and 
combining the melodic and harmonic elements of music. In a way, a music score 
is a kind of sound map in which proceeding from left to right represents the hor­
izontal flow of music through time, and any one freeze-frame of the score shows 
the vertical combination of notes sounding together at that moment, from low 
to high. A piano player, like the conductor of an orchestra, controls these verti­
cal and horizontal elements and the total content in the music, and expresses 
the complete musical picture, not just a single component. Melodies and scales 
represent the horizontal parts, and harmony represents the vertical part.
Getting to know musical forms and styles
Even the simplest melody, say a lullaby or a folk song, carries with it a musi­
cal form and a musical style. To describe its qualities is to define the form 
and style. For example, “Frere Jacques,” a song you play in Book III Chapter 1, 
gets its form from the way each of its four phrases is repeated, doubling the 
length of the song. The simplicity of the melody and the repetition define the 
song’s style as a nursery rhyme — perfect for teaching a child.
As you play the other songs in this book, you come to understand that form 
and style describe how the musical material is used. For example, when 
you play “Worried Man Blues” in Book III Chapter 5, you see that its opening 
phrase is repeated with different notes but the same rhythms in its second 
phrase. The third phrase is the same as the opening phrase, but it leads 
into a new phrase, the fourth and last one. These four phrases make up the 
melody to the song and have a form that can be expressed as ABAC, with 
each letter representing each phrase.
Rhythm plays a powerful role in defining musical style. Both the Mozart sonata 
and the country riff use musical ornaments (covered in Book IV Chapter 1), 
but the songs use them in completely different ways. The most noticeable 
difference is in the way the ornaments affect the rhythm. Popular music grew 
increasingly rhythmic in the 20th century and continues to grow and develop 
rhythmically more than harmonically or melodically. Jazz developed its own 
rhythmic language that was completely different from anything else that came 
before it.

The Best Way to Play
You get the best results when you’re comfortable and enjoying yourself, so 
keep the following tips in mind:
	
✓	Be comfortable. Comfort starts with freedom of movement. Make sure 
you’re physically and mentally at ease when you practice, and watch out 
for signs of fatigue and tension. Take a break when you need it.
	
✓	Play what interests you. Find the songs and sections that use material 
you find interesting and useful for meeting your piano goals.
	
✓	Appreciate the small steps. Remind yourself that your rewards will 
come at all levels but may not come every day.
	
✓	A beginner can play good music. There’s plenty of good music published 
for piano players of all levels, including beginners.
What You Already Know About 
Playing the Piano
Even if you’ve never even touched a piano before, you’ll be surprised at how 
many things you can do right away. You also may already know a few pertinent 
musical facts — and if you don’t, you can master them right now.
	
✓	You can play a pentatonic scale.
	
	Go to your piano or keyboard and play a sequence of black keys, up, 
down, or both. You’ve just played a five-note scale with a fancy name: 
pentatonic. The next time your friends ask what you’ve been up to, tell 
them you’ve been practicing some pentatonic scales.
	
✓	You know the note names used in music.
	
	The seven note names used in music follow the letters of the alphabet 
from A through G. When you play the white keys, you play notes like 
C, F, A, and D. And as you’ll find out in later chapters, you add either 
“sharp” or “flat” to those letters to name the black keys.
	
✓	You can name the two clefs used in reading piano music.
	
	You read music for piano using the treble clef and the bass clef. Most 
of the time, your right hand plays notes in the treble clef, and your left 
hand plays notes in the bass clef.

15

✓	You know the total number of keys on a standard piano.
	
	They don’t call ’em the old 88s for nothin’. You can count all the keys to 
see for yourself. Or check out the black and white keys: There’s a pat­
tern of 12 consecutive black and white keys from the right end of the 
keyboard to the left. Look for seven of these groups and the first four 
keys that begin another group before you run out of keys to count.
	
✓	You can identify different musical styles.
	
	Listen to Track 1 on this book’s online audio site. You’ll hear short exam­
ples of four different piano pieces. Match each excerpt with one of the 
following music styles:
Composer

Scott Joplin
Ragtime
J.S. Bach
Baroque
Erik Satie
Slow, post-Impressionist waltz
W.C. Handy

Electronic Keyboards and other 
Keyboard Instruments
The first thing to realize is that all keyboards aren’t the same. They may make 
different types of sounds by different methods of sound production and are 
meant to do different things for the needs of different players. The following 
sections help you navigate this potentially confusing terrain.
Examining keyboard designs 
throughout the years
Keyboard instruments can be divvied up into the following categories, based 
on how they produce their sound:
	
✓	Acoustic instruments: These instruments require no power to make 
their sound. But they include the acoustic piano, the harpsichord, and 
old pump pipe organs and such. Each produces its sound in different 
ways and sounds distinctly different from the others. And their sounds 
are certainly reproduced in an electronic keyboard.

16
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
✓	Electro-mechanical instruments: These options produce their sounds 
mechanically or acoustically and then have amplifiers and electronics to 
make the sound louder. The classic Rhodes and Wurlitzer electric pianos 
fall into this group, as well as the funky Clavinet (clav) and the mighty 
Hammond organ. These sounds are important to know because they’re 
included in almost every keyboard you try out today.
	
✓	Electronic instruments: Keyboards in this group produce their sounds 
by electronic means, either analog or digital, and are what this book 
covers most in-depth. Electronic keyboards use a variety of technologies 
to produce their sounds. Brochures and websites throw around terms 
like sampling, analog synthesis, DSP, and modeling, along with hundreds 
of seemingly meaningless acronyms.
Touching on key weight
Those black and whites may look the same at first glance, but keys (or the 
key mechanism) can vary greatly from instrument to instrument. The first 
main distinction is whether the keys are weighted. Weighted keys give the 
feel of playing an acoustic piano. These keys may seem harder to play, but 
they offer you much more control over your dynamics, or ability to play 
more softly and loudly.
Non-weighted keys are often called synth-action; they’re lighter to the touch and 
can be faster to play. The next step up is semi-weighted keys, which are firmer, 
more solid light-touch keys. The quality can vary from model to model and 
brand to brand, so it’s an important aspect to consider when buying a keyboard.
Join the family: Grouping keyboards
Electronic keyboards fall into well-established families or categories of instru­
ments. Each has a relatively standard set of features and is meant to be used 
for specific musical needs and playing situations. Within each family, you 
encounter entry-level models that are more basic and then step-up models 
that add to the quality and number of sounds, the number of features, the 
size and quality of the keyboard feel, and so on. The main keyboard “food 
groups” are as follows:
	
✓	Digital pianos: Acoustic piano wannabes or replacements.
	
✓	Stage pianos: Digital pianos intended for the performing musician, with 
additional sounds and pro features.

17
 Chapter 1: Warming Up to the Piano and Keyboard
Book I
Piano & 
Keyboard 
101
	
✓	Portable keyboards: Fun, lightweight, and full of features to help you 
sound better.
	
✓	Arrangers: Keyboards with sophisticated backing features to produce 
the sound of a full band from your simple chord input.
	
✓	Organs: Instruments dedicated to reproducing the sound, features, and 
feel of the legendary Hammond B3. They may include some additional 
sounds such as pipe organ, combo organs, and even other keyboard and 
synth sounds.
	
✓	Synthesizers: Keyboards that allow you to make your own sounds and 
adjust the sounds provided. They can sound the most electronic and 
imaginative but now often include imitative and natural sounds as well.
	
✓	Workstations: Basically, synthesizers with onboard recording systems 
to allow you to create complete works of original music. Very advanced 
and feature-rich.
	
✓	Controllers: Keyboards that don’t make sound themselves but are used to 
trigger sounds from your computer and other keyboards. These options 
use the MIDI standard to communicate with the sound-producing devices.
Book I Chapters 2 and 3 are your keys (pun intended) to getting more info on 
all these families of instruments.
Making the Most of Your Keyboard’s 
Basic Features
You can just turn on your keyboard and start playing, and you’ll have a great 
time. But electronic keyboards can do soooo much more than that. Your key­
board is brimming with features and cool capabilities, like any self-respecting 
tech product these days is. It doesn’t offer video games or let you video chat 
with your friends — yet.
Working with sounds
Some keyboards offer a small grouping of sounds; simple digital pianos may 
have 16 or so. But most keyboards offer at least 100 and sometimes thousands 
of sounds. Finding them, selecting them, and understanding whether they’re 
simple single sounds or complex combinations of instruments stacked on top 
of each other or split between your hands takes some study. Book VI Chapter 1 
breaks that all down and provides step-by-step instructions.

18
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
Exploring effects
What you hear coming out of a keyboard is actually more than just a sound; 
it almost always has some extra sonic treatment called effects added to it. 
Effects are audio treatments such as reverb, chorus, EQ, and delay, and they 
add to the spaciousness, color, and tonality of each sound. Even in simple 
keyboards, you have the choice whether to use them, and many keyboards 
allow you to vary the settings of their effects to produce different results, 
sometimes completely changing what effect a sound uses. Book VI Chapter 2 
has the details.
Getting into automatic playing features
Many of today’s keyboards have some functions that can do some playing 
on their own (with your guidance, of course). You can sit back and let the 
keyboard do some of the work. Here are the most common features (Book VI 
Chapter 2 talks more about these):
	
✓	Drum rhythms: All portables and arrangers and many high-end digital 
pianos offer an on-demand drummer to add some groove to your 
performance. You can select the choices from the front panel, add 
fancy transitions called fills, and sometimes select progressively 
busier variations. Some stage pianos, synths, and workstations also offer 
these grooves, although they may be lurking within the arpeggiator 
feature.
	
✓	Auto-accompaniment: How about having a full backing band ready to 
play whatever style of music, song, or chords you think of? Portables, 
arrangers, and some high-end digital pianos can do that and more. If 
you haven’t been around keyboards and music for some time, you may 
not realize just how good the backing bands on today’s keyboards have 
become. In a word: amazing!
	
✓	Arpeggiation: With arpeggiation, you hold a few notes or a chord, and 
the keyboard repeats them over and over in a dizzying array of possible 
patterns — from simple up and down repetitions to pulsing grooves to 
complex rhythmic patterns. An arpeggiator is often what produces the 
fancy riffs you hear in pop and dance music. Many of the more advanced 
options can also produce realistic guitar strumming, harp flourishes, 
and even drum grooves.

Delving into More Advanced 
Digital Features
Many keyboards have pretty advanced features — some that you would’ve 
thought you needed a computer to do. The following sections dive deeper into 
these digital waters. The chapters in Book VI cover these things in more detail.
Stepping into the virtual recording studio
Keyboards now commonly include some form of recording so that you can 
play and then listen back to yourself. Two forms of recording are available:
	
✓	Audio recording: This method is the recording of the actual sound you 
produced. It’s what you listen to from a CD, an MP3 player, or your 
favorite online music streaming service.
	
✓	MIDI recording: MIDI is the Musical Instrument Digital Interface standard, 
a fancy name for a digital way that musical products can talk to each 
other. It’s not the sound you hear but rather a way of communicating the 
gestures, moves, and settings of your electronic device as you play it.
Each format has its own terms, capabilities, and benefits, and musicians at 
every level use each of them.
Shaping the sounds you play
So many of today’s keyboards offer control over the sounds that are included, 
whether that’s adjusting them a little bit or completely changing them, warping 
them, or building them from the ground up. For many musicians, creating the 
sound is as important as the music they play with it. The art of making sounds 
is usually called programming a keyboard, or sound design. If you’ve heard the 
terms waveform, oscillator, filter, envelope generator, or LFO, you know that 
they’re the building blocks of this creative art.
Checking out the computer connection
Thanks to the development of MIDI, all keyboards can connect to computers 
and tablets for a broad array of activities and enjoyment, from recording and 
sound editing to playing additional sounds that are running on your computer 
to working with virtual teachers. This exciting world is the cutting edge of 
music making and study.

20
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
Practicing with and without Help
Lurking inside many portable keyboards and digital pianos are patient music 
teachers, waiting to help you learn a few tunes and build your musical skills. 
They never yell, won’t slap your wrists with a ruler, and are willing to go over 
things as slowly and as many times as you need. Book VI Chapter 4 explains and 
demonstrates both the Casio and Yamaha ways of giving you virtual keyboard 
lessons and provides practical advice on how to get the most out of them.
But sometimes you hear a song and you just want to sit down and play it 
right away at your keyboard. Why wait until you can buy the music or go to 
your next piano lesson? Learning to play by ear and to figure out songs from 
recordings is a great skill to develop. Some can do it naturally, but for most 
people, it takes some work. Check out Book VI Chapter 5 for help.

e it a piano, organ, or digital keyboard, keyboards come in all shapes 
and sizes. They can have many keys or just a few; they can be huge 
pieces of furniture or little boxes.
Yet at first glance, keyboards seem like they must all be the same. After all, 
each offers the familiar groupings of black and white keys, right? In truth, 
other than the fact that you place your fingers on the same keys to produce 
the same notes, the world of keyboards is vast, and each instrument is played 
somewhat differently from the others. They feel different, they’re different 
sizes and weights, and they can vary significantly in cost. Some keyboards 
produce one sound, others offer a few sounds, and others may produce 
­thousands of different sounds.
This chapter pulls back the curtain on the wide variety of keyboards out 
there. It aims to help you understand the basic technology of how they make 
their sound(s), what makes each one special, and what each is best for. I 
explain how digital pianos reproduce the acoustic for far lower cost, smaller 
size, and less required upkeep. You discover what touch sensitivity is and 
how that dynamic control over volume behaves differently on the various 
types of keyboards. And you learn to recognize when only the real acoustic 
instrument will do.
If you haven’t yet purchased a keyboard, read this chapter to get a feel for 
your options, decide what kind of keyboard interests you, and then turn to 
Book I Chapter 3 for tips on buying your instrument.

Acoustic Pianos
Acoustic means “not electric.” So, acoustic pianos are great for starving musi­
cians because they work even when you can’t pay the electric bill.
Pianos are the most popular acoustic keyboards hands down (there are also 
harpsichords and pump organs, but they are beyond the scope of this book). 
Pianos have a 300-year track record, an incomparable tone, and a sound-­
producing mechanism that has been refined to respond to every subtle 
­variation in your touch. They come in two appropriately named designs:
	
✓	Grand piano: You may need a living room the size of a grand ballroom 
to house the 9-foot concert grand. You may want to consider other sizes, 
from a baby grand (measuring in at about 5 feet) to other sizes up to 7 
feet. You can see a grand piano in Figure 2-1.

Lids
The grand piano has an enormous lid that you prop open with a stick that 
comes with the piano. By propping open the lid, you can see the metal strings 
and other mechanical components . . . and maybe even those car keys that 
you misplaced last month. Because the sound of a piano starts with the 
strings inside the instrument, you get a louder and more resonant sound 
when you leave the lid open, allowing the sound to project off the wooden 
soundboard.
	
The upright piano also has a lid — and may even have a stick to prop it 
open — but only piano tuners actually use the stick to help them keep the lid 
open while they tune the strings. The slightly muffled sound of an upright isn’t 
dramatically increased by opening the lid, but you can try pulling the piano 
away from the wall to get a bigger sound.
String layout
In the grand piano, the strings are horizontal; in the upright, the strings 
are vertical and set diagonally — with the treble strings crossing the bass 
strings — to fit in the smaller upright case.
The difference in the string layout affects the resulting sound of the two 
pianos. The strings in an upright are vertical, so the sound travels ­sideways, 
close to the ground. In contrast, the strings in a grand piano are ­horizontal — 
the sound travels up and fills the room.
Keys, hammers, and strings
Most acoustic pianos today have a row of 88 black and white keys. If you 
have 87, 89, or 32, you may have been cheated! Each of the 88 keys is con­
nected to a small, felt-covered hammer (see Figure 2-3). When you press a 
key, its hammer strikes a string, or set of strings, tuned to the appropriate 
musical note. The string begins to vibrate, your ear picks up these vibrations, 
and you hear music. The entire vibration process occurs in a split second.
To stop the strings from vibrating, another mechanism called a damper sits 
over the strings inside the keyboard. Dampers are made of cloth or felt that 
mutes the strings by preventing any vibration. When you press a key, in addi­
tion to triggering the mechanism that vibrates the string, a piano key also lifts 
the damper. When you release the key (provided you’re not holding down a 
pedal), the damper returns to mute the string.

Electro-Mechanical Keyboards
An electro-mechanical instrument is one that combines an acoustic/mechanical 
sound generator with some additional electronics, usually to help amplify 
or increase the volume of the sound produced. So the initial sound, both the 
tone and pitch, is determined by an acoustic mechanism (usually a string or 
metal object being plucked or struck in some fashion). All these instruments 
include a pickup per string/tone (a device that translates sound vibrations 
into an electrical signal) and an amplification system for you to hear their 
sound, which means they require electricity to operate. And without the 
sounds being fed into an onboard or external speaker, you wouldn’t be able 
to hear them.
These instruments are so popular that they remain the core group of sounds 
(along with the acoustic piano) reproduced in all electronic keyboards to this 
day. So getting more familiar with their features and sound is an important 
part of your keyboard education.
The most common of these instruments include the following:
	
✓	Rhodes electric piano, sometimes called the Fender Rhodes and often 
alluded to as a tine piano (Figure 2-4)
	
✓	Wurlitzer electric piano, often referred to as a reed piano (Figure 2-5)
	
✓	Hohner Clavinet, commonly called clav for short (Figure 2-6)
	
✓	The Hammond organ, producing its sound through a tonewheel method 
(Figure 2-7)
	
✓	Hohner Pianet electric grand piano
	
✓	Yamaha CP-70/80 electric grand piano

Electronic Keyboards
Electronic keyboards produce their sounds completely by some electronic or 
digital means. They may contain tubes or resistors, chips, and circuit boards 
inside — but no vibrating strings or spinning elements are involved.
Combo organs
The early combo organs from the 1960s, such as the Vox Continental 
(Figure 2-8) and the Farfisa Compact, are common examples of electronic 
keyboards used in pop and rock music of that day. Throughout the 1950s and 
1960s, electronic console and theatre organs were the main home keyboards 
other than an acoustic piano.

Synthesizers
All too often, electronic keyboards are called synthesizers (or synths for 
short). A synthesizer is an electronic instrument with the primary purpose of 
creating and shaping sound and the parameters to do so. So a digital piano 
that has some simple sound tweaking settings isn’t a synth. A synth goes 
beyond the emulation of acoustic instruments and electro-mechanical key­
boards; it’s an instrument for people who enjoy the imaginative and creative 
possibilities of new and fresh sounds.
Sound can be created from analog, digital, sample-playback, or modeled tech­
nologies, and sometimes these technologies are combined in a single instru­
ment. The earliest analog synthesizers had various modules of electronics.
Synthesizers today come in many shapes and sizes; some have mini keys and 
are relatively inexpensive, whereas others have full-sized keys but are only 
monophonic and have shorter key ranges (sometimes only 25 or 37 keys). 
Still others offer more polyphony and 49- and 61-key ranges. Some synths 
even offer 88-key weighted keys.
In the late 1960s/early 1970s, the Moog synthesizer started to be used in 
rock, pop, and other types of music. Figure 2-9 shows the Moog modu­
lar system that Keith Emerson used for the classic solo on Emerson, 
Lake & Palmer’s “Lucky Man.” Other brands soon followed, such as ARP, 
Sequential Circuits, Oberheim, EML, EMS, and Korg. These instruments are 
all examples of analog electronics, where electronic voltages move between 
components and are manipulated to produce the desired sound. Many of 
these famous analog synthesizers are still sought after and used today 
because each has its own characteristic sound and features. Analog syn­
thesizers remain so popular that a number of companies are making new 
models today, from the simple to the highly complex. Examples include 
the Moog Sub Phatty, Dave Smith Instruments’ Mopho, and the Arturia 
MicroBrute.
To help create sounds, the front panel and overall interface of a ­synthesizer 
have dedicated controls for the most important parameters for sound ­creation: 
Knobs and sliders are most common, although switches, buttons, ribbons, 
pads, and other controls may be available. Here are some typical controls:

✓	An oscillator produces the basic waveform or sound. A special type of 
oscillator called a low frequency oscillator (LFO) modulates another 
parameter to create vibrato (pitch fluctuation), wah-wah types of sound 
(filter fluctuation), and tremolo (volume fluctuation).
	
✓	A filter shapes the tonal character of the oscillator by blocking certain 
frequencies from passing or by accentuating them.
	
✓	An amplifier or amp adjusts the level of the sound.
	
✓	An envelope generator modifies the levels of a signal over time. This 
function is commonly applied to both the filter and the amp, but you can 
also use it to change pitch over time and other characteristics.
	
Check out Tracks 2 through 4 for examples of the Vox and Farfisa organs as 
well as a Moog synthesizer.
The mid-1980s saw the development of the digital keyboard and synthe­
sizer that has continued through today. These products are really dedi­
cated computers running software designed to do a specialized task: Make 
musical sounds. Most use custom chips and circuits and won’t run your 
favorite shoot-’em-up games or connect to the Internet, but some can

repurpose a computer to become a complete music studio. Some of the most 
famous ­digital keyboards/synths are the Yamaha DX7, the Korg M1 music 
­workstation, the E-mu Emulator sampling keyboard, and the Casio SK-1. All 
the keyboards discussed in the next section are electronic, and they’re by 
far the most common type you find today. Figure 2-10 shows a modern-day 
­electronic keyboard.

Portable keyboards
Portable keyboards usually fall in to the range of entry-level to slightly more 
advanced instruments that combine basic sounds with some fun and/or 
simple learning features and onboard accompaniment. They’re geared more 
toward beginners and are very affordable. Portable electronic keyboards first 
came to prominence in the 1980s and were pioneered by Casio and Yamaha, 
as they still are today. This category of keyboards has really developed in 
recent years and now offers a surprising amount of features and value for 
the money.
Most portable keyboards use regular sized, non-weighted synth action keys, 
not weighted keys like a piano does. Key ranges come in 49- and 61-key 
lengths, sometimes offering up to 88 semi-weighted keys.
The sounds are produced by sample-playback technology and tend to be 
decent but pretty basic. Portable keyboards don’t have a lot of memory for 
the samples, so don’t expect pro quality; however, the sounds are surpris­
ingly good for the money. What they may lack in quality they certainly make 
up for in quantity; these keyboards usually offer between 400 and 800 sounds! 
Along with real instrument sounds and some general-purpose synth sounds, 
these keyboards often have some fun sound effects and other noises that can 
be fun for kids (and kids at heart) to play with.

Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
Workstations
A workstation is a synthesizer that has some form of onboard recording 
included. So a workstation is always a synthesizer (because it allows you to 
create new sounds), but a synthesizer isn’t necessarily a workstation (because 
it doesn’t necessarily have an onboard sequencer, or recording function).
Synthesizer workstations use digital forms of sound production, be they 
sample-playback, digital synthesis, modeling technology, or combinations of 
all these. User-sampling is sometimes included, so you can record your own 
sounds, sound effects, or load in sounds that others make.
The workstation tends to be a jack-of-all trades because it combines sound 
creation, music recording, and live performance features in one box. Many 
musicians buy one for the sound, regardless of whether they need all the 
other features, because often a manufacturer’s best-in-class model is a 
workstation. Workstations usually come in 61-key synth action and 88-key 
weighted action key lengths, and the upper-end models usually offer after­
touch. Some brands offer 73 or 76-key versions.
	
The workstation gets a bad rap as a recording platform in some circles because 
computer audio/MIDI recording systems have far outclassed its capabilities. 
But sometimes just turning on one dedicated system is easier and more intui­
tive for capturing a quick idea. And a workstation is an all-in-one, so it’s far 
easier to take around with you. Thanks to the universality of MIDI, you don’t 
have to make an either/or choice; you can use the workstation by itself or 
­connect it to your computer and use those tools as well.
Arrangers
An arranger keyboard is an instrument that combines a wide variety of 
sounds with an automatic accompaniment system, which produces the 
sound of a full backing band from simple chords you play.
	
Many portable keyboards also have this feature, so what makes a product an 
arranger is the quality of the sounds, the inclusion of other pro features, and 
the general build quality of the case and onboard speakers. Really, the dividing 
line between portables and arrangers typically comes down to price. Anything 
higher than $500 or so is probably being called an arranger. Arranger keyboards 
usually use sample-playback technology to produce their sound, although 
some also offer a form of organ modeling as well.

33
 Chapter 2: Looking at the Different Keyboard Options
Book I
Piano & 
Keyboard 
101
The concept of automatic accompaniment was first introduced in home and 
theatre organs from the1950s and 1960s and moved into digital keyboards 
in the early 1980s. The basic idea is that by playing only minimal parts with 
your left hand (to feed the automatic accompaniment system) you can sound 
like you’re playing with a complete band of musicians who know every song 
you do!
An arranger keyboard is considered the professional keyboard across much 
of Europe and throughout the Middle East, so it has many advanced features 
for live performance including mic input, vocal effects, and even onscreen 
lyric display so you’ll never forget the words to a song again.
Controller keyboards
With the advent of MIDI in 1983, the concept of the sound module was born. 
Because MIDI allowed you to connect multiple keyboards and trigger them 
all from one master keyboard, you didn’t need every other sound source 
to always have keys on it. You just needed a box that had the sounds you 
wanted. This setup saved you space and cost. Over time, a new class of key­
board arose out of this situation: the controller keyboard — a MIDI keyboard 
that usually produces no sound by itself but rather is designed to control 
other keyboards, modules, and (increasingly) music software instruments 
and applications.
A controller keyboard may come in any length. A whole class of mini- and 
micro-sized controllers has developed to serve the mobile musician looking 
to carry her whole music studio with her wherever she goes.
Besides keys for triggering notes, controller keyboards need to be able 
to send various types of MIDI messages to the receiving device. Selecting 
sounds is of course essential, as are some wheels, knobs, sliders, and/or 
switches to add some expression or variations to the sound, much like the 
knobs on a synthesizer. Velocity-sensitive drum pads have become common 
on most mid- and upper-end controllers.
Controller keyboards are often used not only to play sounds but also to 
­operate the MIDI and audio recording software used on computers so that 
the controls also serve to mix track levels, position sounds in the stereo field, 
solo and mute tracks, and other recording console functions.

Appreciating How Digital Keyboards 
Make So Many Sounds
Today’s keyboards are pretty amazing; press a button and any sound can 
come out. Acoustic piano, electric piano, and organs? Check. Saxes, flute, 
trumpet, trombone, violin, and cello? Check. Rock guitar, bass, drums, and 
even crowd applause? Check. Soaring synth leads, burbling electronic blips 
and bleeps, and swooshing and sweeping sound effects? All that and more.
Did you ever wonder how they make all these different sounds? Digital key­
boards aren’t all the same; they produce their sounds many different ways. 
Here are the major methods they use (check out Book VI Chapter 3 for how 
to use these methods to shape sounds):
	
✓	Digital synthesis: Digital synthesis is a broad category indicating that the 
manufacturer has designed a special method of making sound, using a 
computer chip to produce artificial tones that can be varied and manipu­
lated into many different sounds. Frequency modulation (FM) is a form of 
algorithmic synthesis that Yamaha used to produce many highly success­
ful synths like the DX7, and it’s still used today in some products. Casio 
had what they called phase distortion (PD) in its CZ range of synths, and 
Kawai used a digital technology called additive synthesis in its K-series 
synths, to name just a few.
	
✓	Sample-playback: Sampling is the process of digitally recording the 
sound of a real-world object and being able to play it back and further 
manipulate the recording. Sample-playback can sound much more real­
istic than other forms of synthesis because it’s using the real sound as 
opposed to a re-creation or imitation of an instrument’s sound. Sampling 
first appeared in keyboards in the 1980s, and instruments like the E-mu 
Emulator, the Ensoniq Mirage, the Fairlight CMI, and Akai samplers 
became very popular. Because digital memory was very expensive in 
those days, the sounds were good but not yet great. Costs have come 
down over the years, and today sampling keyboards (and computer 
­software) produce highly nuanced and very realistic sounds.
	
✓	Physical modeling: Physical modeling is another form of digital ­synthesis, 
but it specifically focuses on studying how a real-world instrument 
­creates its sound and then re-creates each piece or component of the 
original device down to its materials, behaviors, and responses. For 
example, to replicate a drum’s sound, you’d look to the materials the 
head and body are made from, the size of the body or shell, and so on, 
and how that part of the instrument would change over time after being 
activated or react depending on how it was struck. Stringed, woodwind, 
and brass instruments, drums, and mallet instruments are all areas that 
have been explored using this approach.

35
 Chapter 2: Looking at the Different Keyboard Options
Book I
Piano & 
Keyboard 
101
	
	In the world of keyboards, the most common instruments modeled in 
this fashion are the clav, the Rhodes and Wurlitzer electric pianos, and 
especially the Hammond organ. This form of synthesis gives you very 
detailed control over all aspects of the sound and in some instruments 
lets you create new designs that don’t exist in real life. Roland has 
done some very interesting things in this regard for the acoustic piano 
(in V-Piano), allowing you to imitate changing the strings’ material and 
length, the hammer’s size and material, and other futuristic manipula­
tions. In software, a company called Modartt is doing similar things with 
its Pianoteq line of titles.
	
✓	Virtual analog: Virtual analog is similar to physical modeling but has 
grown into a category of its own; the initial goal was to re-create the 
complete layout and character of an existing (usually analog) ­synthesizer. 
Virtual analog is a very popular segment, and models exist in both 
hardware and computer software forms. The designer studies and often 
­re-creates each element at the component level and attempts to re-create 
the sound, response, and complete feature set of a given classic synthe­
sizer. From there, the designer often adds new features and expands the 
capabilities of the synth to bring it into the modern age. Many compa­
nies make new, imaginative synths with this method, creating an instru­
ment with the types of parameters and capabilities of the classics along 
with their own ideas, often bringing together forms of digital synthesis 
along with the modeled analog synthesis. Examples include the Nord 
Lead 4, Access Virus TI2, Korg KingKORG, and Roland GAIA SH-01.
Considering Key Feel and Response
The design, feel, and touch of the key mechanism (commonly called the key 
action) used on modern keyboards can vary a great deal. Understanding 
how key actions work and what each offers can help you differentiate among 
the various types of keyboards and models offered. The following sections 
­introduce a couple of important key action characteristics.
Touch sensitivity
	
Key actions come in two main classes: dynamic (touch-sensitive or velocity-
sensitive) and non-dynamic. The term dynamics in music refers to changes in 
loudness or volume.
A velocity-sensitive key action responds to how firmly or softly you play the 
key, transferring that energy to the sound-producing mechanism to allow 
you to play many different volume levels from soft to loud. Non-dynamic 

36
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
keyboards have keys that are simple on/off switches that cause the sound to 
play. You create dynamics by using a foot pedal, not by varying the touch of 
your fingers on the keys.
The acoustic piano is velocity-sensitive and can produce an incredibly wide 
range of dynamics. The Rhodes and Wurlitzer electric pianos and the clav 
are also velocity-sensitive, although they have narrower ranges of dynamics. 
The pipe organ, all combo/console/theatre organs, and the harpsichord, on 
the other hand, aren’t velocity-sensitive. For example, the harpsichord’s quill 
always plucks the string the same way, so the dynamics don’t change. Early 
analog synthesizers used organ keyboards, so they too were non-dynamic.
Later high-end analog synthesizer models added touch sensitivity; ­examples 
include the Yamaha CS-80, Sequential Circuits Prophet T8, and Moog Polymoog. 
But the advent of digital synthesis and MIDI made velocity-sensitive synthesizers 
and keyboards much more common.
Velocity-sensitive synthesizers have two sensors, as shown in Figure 2-11; the 
first is at the top of the key, where the key sits when at rest. The other is at 
the bottom of the key action, where the key reaches when pressed down fully. 
The system uses these sensors to measure how quickly the key moves from 
the top to the bottom and then translates that speed or value into a dynamic 
level. The idea is that the harder you press a key, the faster it actually moves 
downward. So soft touch is actually a slow depression of the key, and hard 
touch is a faster movement.

The terms velocity-sensitive and touch-sensitive are often used interchangeably, 
but velocity sensitivity is the truly correct term for today’s electronic keyboards 
because it’s how MIDI translates the playing force into different values.
Key weight
A few types of keys are available on keyboards, some lighter and others 
heavier to the touch.
	
Key weight has nothing to do with the dynamics of the key mechanism 
­discussed in the preceding section. Any type of key can be velocity-sensitive, 
regardless of which of the following weight classes it falls into:
	
✓	(Fully) weighted: A weighted or fully weighted key imitates the mass 
of the piano key action. Both acoustic piano keys and high-end digital 
piano keys are made of wood with a coating or veneer on top. The 
keys have a certain amount of weight to them, so your finger exerts 
more energy to make them move. This resistance gives you more feed­
back when you’re trying to play dynamically, and that allows for more 
nuanced control of soft dynamics. (That control is why serious pianists 
prefer weighted keys). The key has a slightly protruding top front lip and 
is enclosed on the front surface.
	
✓	Semi-weighted: Semi-weighted keys provide a middle ground between 
weighted and non-weighted key mechanisms for synth actions. Some 
manufacturers add some weight to the non-weighted synth key or plastic 
piano-shaped key (usually by gluing a metal bar to the underside of the 
key) to increase its mass and make it feel a bit more solid to the touch. It 
usually has a spring in the mechanism to provide resistance to your touch.
	
✓	Non-weighted: Non-weighted or synth-action keys are the lightest, simplest 
action. They often have some spring in the mechanism to add some 
slight resistance — just enough to keep them from feeling loose and 
uncontrollable. Simpler plastic keys used on combo organs and synthe­
sizers have little mass, or resistance, to them, so they can be played 
very easily and often more quickly. This key is made entirely of plastic 
and looks more like a diving board with no front edge. Non-weighted 
keys are preferred by non-pianists and for playing organ, clav, and synth 
sounds, which aren’t called upon to reproduce wide dynamics.

38
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
Paying Attention to Polyphony
After you start to explore electronic keyboards, you need to understand and 
consider polyphony. Polyphony means “many voices,” and in music it means 
having multiple tones or parts playing at the same time. In an instrument, 
it’s the ability to play more than one note at a time. A trumpet, a flute, a 
saxophone, and even the human voice can sound only one note at a time, 
so they’re monophonic.
The guitar has six strings, so it’s considered six-note polyphonic. The acoustic 
bass has four strings, so it’s — yup — four-note polyphonic. Acoustic and 
electro-mechanical keyboards have as much polyphony as they have keys. 
So the piano is considered 88-note polyphonic!
	
However, this one-to-one key-to-polyphony ratio isn’t true of electronic key­
boards because the key isn’t attached directly to the sound-producing mecha­
nism (for example, a string). Rather, a chip or circuitry inside the keyboard 
produces the sound, and the power of those electronics is what determines 
how many notes you can play.
In keyboards, some analog synthesizers are monophonic because in the early 
days, building a polyphonic synthesizer was very expensive. With the advent 
of digital technology, today’s electronic keyboards generally seem to have big 
numbers for their polyphony; you see specs that state 32, 64, 100, 128, and 
up to 256 voices or notes of polyphony. However, various factors can quickly 
reduce the amount of polyphony truly available:
	
✓	Playing a piano sound for a couple of bars with the damper (or sustain) 
pedal down uses up a lot of notes in a short time.
	
✓	Some instruments use two voices to produce a stereo sound, so you cut 
the polyphony in half when playing one of them. The same issue applies 
when playing a layered sound (two sounds at the same time, such as 
piano and strings). At minimum, you’re using two voices for each note 
played, and this number can double or quadruple depending on how the 
sounds are designed.
	
✓	If your keyboard is playing a drum rhythm or producing auto-
accompaniment patterns as you play, they too require notes of 
polyphony to sound.
What happens when you run out of polyphony? The designers of electronic 
keyboards are very smart; what they usually do is “rob” or stop sounding the 
oldest sustaining note. So as you keep playing piano with the sustain pedal 
down, your earliest-played notes start to shut off, one by one, until you let off 
the pedal and start again. This way, you always hear the most recent notes as 

39
 Chapter 2: Looking at the Different Keyboard Options
Book I

101
you play them, and only the notes that are already fading away are robbed. 
If a lot of voices are required to play a single layered or complex sound, this 
stealing of voices happens more quickly, and is more noticeable.
	
So when you’re checking out a keyboard, reading the specs may not be enough. 
Yes, more polyphony is always better, but you have to figure out whether what 
a keyboard offers is enough for you depending on what features you plan to 
use regularly. Try playing your favorite songs, go for the layered sounds, or 
turn on any rhythms or accompaniment offered. Listen as you play for any 
noticeable note-stealing. Remember that this effect is most noticeable in solo, 
exposed playing. If you’ll be playing in a band, you may not notice it as much, 
and that’s a good thing.

G

 randma’s old upright piano may satisfy your urges to play the keyboard 
for a while. However, at some point you may experience the undeniable 
urge to purchase or rent a piano or keyboard of your own. Probably right 
around the time that Grandma gets tired of hearing you play “Yankee Doodle” 
for the hundredth time.
	
When the urge to acquire a piano or keyboard strikes, don’t pull out that 
checkbook or debit card just yet. Spend the time to research, shop around, 
and choose exactly the kind of piano or keyboard you want.
If you’re just starting out playing or have put in very little time studying 
so far, you don’t need the top-of-the-line model. Likewise, if you’re pretty 
­accomplished, you may be tempted to just go for the most keyboard your 
budget can afford — but price shouldn’t be the only criteria for your choice.
This chapter guides you through the various considerations you should 
­evaluate to decide what’s the right choice. Reflecting honestly about your skill 
level and where you think you want to go with your playing is a good first step. 
Making sure your choice offers you the sounds and features for your favorite 
styles of music is a must.

First Things First: Acoustic 
or Electric (or Both)?
The first thing you need to decide when selecting a keyboard is whether 
you want an acoustic one or not. (See Book I Chapter 2 for an explanation of 
acoustic and digital keyboards.) Don’t just flip a coin. Make a list of pros and 
cons to help you decide which type of keyboard is best for you.
The following sections can help you get started with lists of some pros and 
cons for both acoustic and digital keyboards. Then personalize the lists, 
adding your own perceptions, factors, and concerns. It’s your keyboard, after 
all. Base your buying or renting decision on the pros and cons that you come 
up with and that are the most important to you.
Pros and cons of acoustic keyboards
Psalteries, virginals, clavichords, and harmoniums are acoustic ­keyboards. 
Honestly, you don’t need a list of pros and cons for these very rare instruments. 
If you find one and can’t live without it, go ahead and purchase it.
Pianos, harpsichords, and pipe organs are also acoustic keyboards. The pros 
and cons in this section focus on acoustic pianos because they’re the most 
commonly purchased acoustic keyboards.

✓	Sound quality: No matter how good a digital keyboard is, it doesn’t 
match the sound and feel of a grand piano — or even an upright piano.
	
✓	Value: Good-quality acoustic pianos appreciate in value over the years if 
kept in good condition. You can think of your purchase as an investment.
	
✓	Aesthetics: There’s nothing like playing an acoustic piano. It feels real, 
it looks great, and you can imagine yourself on a concert stage.
Cons
Here are valid concerns about acoustic pianos:
	
✓	Cost: Plain and simple, new and even used pianos are generally more 
expensive than new digital keyboards.
	
✓	Size and space: Get practical and think about whether you have room to 
house the piano and play it. You should also measure the doorway while 
you’re at it to make sure you can even get the piano where you want it.

✓	Maintenance: Annual or semiannual tuning at a cost of around $75 to 
$150 per tuning isn’t cheap, but it’s essential. (Book I Chapter 4 tells you 
more about maintaining your acoustic keyboard.)
Pros and cons of digital keyboards
You can rent some digital keyboards, but not all. Some of the fancier models 
are mostly for sale only, although you may find a used one in good ­condition. 
On the other hand, plenty of stores offer a rental option on larger digital 
pianos or digital organs. Many online stores will ship a keyboard to you and 
provide knowledgeable staff available by phone.
	
Looking for used keyboards online can yield lots of options, but you really 
need to be able to see and play a keyboard before you buy. (See the section 
“Shopping online” later in this chapter for online buying tips.)
Pros
Digital keyboards have the following positive points going for them:
	
✓	Cost: Unless you’re talking about very high-end models, most digital 
­keyboards are more affordable than pianos.
	
✓	Size: No matter where you live, you can find a spot for your digital key­
board. Plus, they are much, much easier to move.
	
✓	Versatility: Most digital keyboards come loaded with different sounds, 
so you can be a one-person band or make almost any sounds you want.
	
✓	Maintenance: Digital keyboards require no tuning and no tweaking — 
you just plug and play. (And dust — check out Book IV Chapter 4.)
	
✓	Silence: If you have grouchy neighbors, young children, or other house­
mates who demand quiet, headphones really help. You can turn off the 
sound to the outside world and still hear yourself practice.
Cons
Consider the following before making a purchase:
	
✓	Complexity: Some digital keyboards come with a baffling number of 
sampled sounds, sequencing tools, effects, levers, and knobs. Figuring 
out how to utilize these features requires a steep learning curve. 
Additionally, knobs and levers can break, circuitry can go haywire, and 
any number of other things can go wrong over the years.
	
✓	Power: You must have electricity, or at least a whole bunch of D-size 
batteries, in order to play your digital keyboard.
	
✓	Sound quality: Some digital sounds are out-of-this-world fantastic, but 
others can be unconvincing when mimicking an acoustic instrument.

44
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
✓	Keyboard action: Many digital keyboards aren’t touch-sensitive, meaning 
that whether you play the key hard or soft, you hear the same volume. 
Models with “weighted action” try to give you the feel of an acoustic 
piano; some succeed, and some fail.
	
✓	Obsolescence: Like most electronic devices and computers, today’s key­
boards probably won’t be tomorrow’s desire. Eventually you’ll want to 
upgrade to the latest and greatest model, and very few digital keyboards 
retain their value.
	
✓	Addiction: If you buy one, pretty soon you’ll want another, and another, 
and another. Or you’ll want more sound samples, a better amp, a better 
speaker, a new stand, or a new case. The common mantra among 
keyboard players in the digital world is, “I need more gear!”
Going hybrid
They combine the best of both worlds! They 
offer unmatched versatility! They cost a million 
dollars! Well, not that much, but hybrid acoustic/
digital keyboards are expensive. If the idea of a 
hybrid interests you, there are two ways to go: 
Buy an acoustic/digital hybrid piano, or have 
your acoustic piano retrofitted with a digital 
player system.
Among the growing list of things these hybrid 
pianos and player piano systems can do are
	✓	Record, play back, and mute (muting stops 
the hammers from hitting the strings — but 
you can hear yourself by plugging in 
headphones).
	✓	Connect with other MIDI instruments and 
MIDI files (see the section “The MIDI 
Places You Can Go” later in this chapter for 
more on MIDI).
	✓	Access sound libraries and karaoke librar­
ies, play along with pre-recorded tracks, 
and play along with MIDI feeds available 
over the Internet through a USB or wireless 
connection. These options open the door to 
a wide range of instructional and entertain­
ment possibilities.
Yamaha Disklavier leads the field of digital and 
acoustic technology with its hybrid pianos. 
PianoDisc, QRS, and Bösendorfer also make 
player piano systems that can be installed on 
your acoustic piano.
Be careful if you’re thinking about retrofitting 
your piano with a player piano system. This can 
involve some significant physical alteration of 
your piano, and you won’t be able to go back 
after it’s done! Consult with a piano techni­
cian before signing on the dotted line. Ask how 
your piano would be affected by an installation, 
including the sound, the feel, and the value of 
the instrument.

Looking At What’s Important 
for the Beginner
There’s nothing wrong with recognizing that you’re a beginner. Perhaps you 
took a few lessons many years ago and have now decided you want to get 
back to the joy of making music for fun and relaxation. That’s great! You’re 
likely a beginner and should be proud of that. (Sorry, being able to play The 
Kingsmen’s “Louie Louie” or Harold Faltermeyer’s “Axel F” [the theme from 
Beverley Hills Cop] doesn’t make you an accomplished player. And it just may 
get you kicked out of your local music store if you keep coming in and playing 
them for hours on end.)
Maybe you never took a lesson or even touched a keyboard except for using 
the one on your computer to send a few e-mails and post pictures of your cat. 
Now you want to start to play the musical keyboard for fun or to get involved 
with your church or school. Wonderful! Playing music is a great way to let off 
a little steam, express yourself, and experience the joy of artistic creation.
Perhaps you’ve bought (or inherited) a rather old, beat-up acoustic piano and 
have only been taking lessons for a little while. You’re doing okay with your 
lessons, but your piano sounds bad, won’t hold a tuning, or takes up too much 
room in your home, so you’re considering moving into the electronic realm.
Whatever your beginner story, here’s a small list of things to consider when 
choosing an electronic keyboard:
	
✓	Piano features: The first fork in the road that you must consider when 
selecting a keyboard is whether you want to play primarily acoustic 
piano sound and styles of music. If so, you need to be sure that whatever 
you’re looking at offers that sound; most keyboards today do, and you’ll 
be surprised to see that even some organs and programmable synthesiz­
ers do. The basic piano features you need in this situation are
 
• A weighted key mechanism: Only a weighted key action gives you 
the true piano feel experience.
 
• At least 61 keys (5 octaves): Remember that an acoustic piano 
has 88 keys (a little more than 7 octaves). For beginner lessons, 
you play in only one to three octaves, but you’ll be expanding your 
reach farther in no time.
 
• At least one pedal to help you sustain your notes: This feature 
is called a damper pedal on an acoustic piano but may be called a 
­sustain pedal or just a momentary pedal depending on your model.

46
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
✓	A variety of sounds: Every beginner should get a keyboard that offers 
more than one type of sound regardless of whether she has a piano-­
centric musical taste or goal. Being able to hear what you play with 
­different tones keeps your playing and practicing experience interesting 
and fresh. You should have some variety.
	
✓	A metronome or drum rhythms: To develop your playing, you need a 
steady timekeeper to help get your rhythm solid. A metronome is the 
device students use for this purpose. Back in the day, it was a wooden, 
wind-up box that had a metal wand that swung back and forth, ­clicking 
as it went, but metronomes migrated to being electronic years ago. 
In your keyboard it can be as simple as a steady click or beep that you 
can set the speed of; you can also use built-in drum rhythms to not only 
keep your time steady but also make your practice and performance 
more polished-sounding and fun. You can buy these features separately, 
but getting a keyboard that already includes them is much simpler.
	
✓	Other aids for study or learning: If you’re planning to study or take 
lessons or you want some help in learning to play, you should consider 
having a simple onboard recorder, which allows you to record and then 
listen back to your playing. Evaluating what you’re doing is so much 
easier as an observer than as a participant.
	
✓	Accompaniment features: Some keyboards can provide extra band 
members to play along with you. You can simply add an extra hand for 
your piano playing or go all the way up to the sound of a full group of 
players: drums, bass, other chord parts, and fancy extras. Taking advan­
tage of these features can deliver a very full sound without a lot of play­
ing technique or effort. Accompaniment can make your practice time 
more interesting by letting you hear your pieces in different settings and 
giving you the experience of playing along with other musicians.
Playing Well With Others and Alone
Some features can become more important based on the situation(s) you’ll 
be playing your keyboard in — features that are helpful for solo work may not 
mean much for a band member. This section contains some tips and observa­
tions to help you make the best choice for your needs.
	
An onboard music rack or stand can be helpful in lots of performance situa­
tions because most require you to read some music. Playing classical music in 
particular often involves reading from large scores, so you need to consider 
whether the supplied rack will hold the size and bulk of the music you’ll be 
using. Forward-thinking musicians are starting to use tablet computers as 
their music readers, and those are more likely than huge paper scores to fit on 
the average supplied keyboard music rack.

Going solo
You can find two main schools of solo keyboard performance: the solo pianist 
and the one-man band.
As a solo pianist, you basically play piano, piano layered with strings or a 
warm synth sound, and perhaps some electric piano. So the best-quality 
sounds with all possible nuances work well. Your sound is very exposed so 
even subtle aspects like damper resonance and key-off samples can be heard 
and enjoyed. Having some backing rhythms is nice because they add to your 
performance while still allowing the solo piano approach to shine. You will be 
playing in small rooms or as background music a lot, so onboard ­speakers can 
usually carry your performance, making your setup much easier. If you’re a 
singer-songwriter and will be playing in clubs with sound systems, you don’t 
need much beyond your keyboard, a stand, and your pedal(s), plus maybe a 
­microphone input with some dedicated reverb for your voice. A number of 
stage pianos and arranger keyboards offer this feature.
The one-man band is more of an outgoing entertainer; you’re playing a wide 
variety of music, talking, and likely singing, and you need to come off like a 
complete band. The professional arranger is the best choice of keyboard for 
this work, for sure. You can put together this type of show with a workstation 
keyboard, but doing so requires much more time and effort developing the 
backing tracks to play all the songs you’ll need to cover. Only the fussiest and 
most advanced keyboardists are likely to go that route. Choosing the right 
arranger keyboard for you comes down to quality and variety of sounds, 
accompaniment patterns, mic input, keyboard feel, and perhaps vocal 
­harmony features.
Accompanying vocalists
Having a transpose function can be very helpful if you are playing in a duo or 
small group with a vocalist. A singer often needs to change the key of a song 
to stay in the most comfortable range. And because males and females have 
different vocal ranges, they almost never sing a given song in the same key as 
each other.
Learning how to play a song in more than one key is a more advanced musi­
cal skill, so why not let technology help you out? A transpose function shifts 
the tuning of the keyboard so you can keep playing in the key of C on the 
keys, but the notes that come out will be moved up or down by an amount 
you specify. So by simply selecting a transpose value, you can now play in 
any key you require with no change in your playing. Thank you, technology!

48
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
If this option is important to you, check out your potential keyboard candi­
dates to see how easily you can access this feature; is it right on the front 
panel, or do you have to go wading through a lot of menu pages? Can you 
easily turn off the function so you’re back to normal tuning/operation? Does 
the feature show or tell you that you’re currently transposed? Pianists have 
told me stories about starting a song and getting angry or confused stares 
from a singer, only to realize that they were still transposed from the last 
song and had forgotten about it. Having to stop and start  again because 
“it’s the keyboard player’s fault” can be very embarrassing.
Performing classical music with others
A great piano sound and perhaps pipe organ and harpsichord are obviously your 
main sound choices when playing classical music with others. But many musi­
cians have stories of how they had to help augment a given classical or church 
ensemble to cover the parts of a missing or sick member and were the hero of 
the day when their keyboards could reproduce the solo string, woodwind, or 
even percussion instrument that was required. This benefit is certainly some­
thing to consider if your music choices will include all these instrument types.
Onboard speakers are another good feature because you don’t need to be very 
loud when playing classical, and the sight of an electronic keyboard in this type 
of ensemble can already be a cause of some concern. Carry in an instrument 
amplifier or speaker system, and who knows what the reaction will be.
Jamming in a pop, rock, or jazz band
Playing in a band usually means you have to cover many more sounds than just 
typical keyboard sounds. Be sure to evaluate the synth, string, brass, and vocal 
sounds carefully so you ensure that you can cover all the styles of music needed.
You often have to cover more than one part, so split and layer features are 
important. You should be able to store these multisound parts and recall 
them easily. Having a special live mode where you can arrange sounds in 
order so you can change them easily during a song is also very helpful. 
This way, you can mix and match single sounds and multipart sounds in an 
easy list to select from. Many performers like to use a foot pedal to advance 
through these lists so their hands can stay on the keyboard at all times.
Having the ability to keep one sound sustaining while you change to your 
next sound is becoming more common, or at least more in demand from 
players. With this feature, current notes keep sounding while the new sound 
loads in the background; only when you play new notes do you hear the new 
sound, so you can get a seamless (not choppy) transition between sounds. 
This function, called names such as patch remain, smooth sound transition, 
seamless sound change, and so on, is certainly worth asking about.

Band work is the most common place where you see players using more than 
one keyboard. The most common reason for this arrangement is the feel of 
the keys. Playing piano on an unweighted synth action isn’t very satisfying; 
trying to play tonewheel organ on a weighted keyboard is equally difficult 
and can be downright painful when you attempt to do the palm slides up and 
down the keys that are common in organ playing. Likewise, playing rhythmic 
clav and fast synth parts is much easier on the unweighted keys. (I discuss 
key weight earlier in the chapter.)
A second issue is that a single keyboard may not be able to provide enough 
key range per part for the split and/or layered parts you need to cover. A two-
keyboard approach becomes the right answer. How to choose what type of 
keyboards depends on whether you are primarily a pianist who needs extra 
sounds, an organist who needs extra sounds, or perhaps an electronic music 
performer who needs a variety of instruments. Here are some of the most 
common approaches/combinations:
	
✓	Piano/stage piano on the bottom with an all-purpose synth/workstation 
on top
	
✓	Piano/stage piano on the bottom with an organ on top
	
✓	Weighted action workstation on the bottom with synth action synth/
workstation on top
	
✓	Weighted action workstation on the bottom with organ on top
	
✓	Organ on the bottom (sometimes dual manual organ) with stage piano 
on top
	
✓	Organ on the bottom (sometimes dual manual organ) with all-purpose 
synth/workstation on top
Picking the Perfect Acoustic Piano
If your pro and con list reveals that an acoustic piano suits your needs best, 
use this section to help select the right model piano for you.
Taking location into account
Most older pianos were produced with a particular climate in mind. The 
wood used to make them was weathered for the finished product’s climate. 
Japan, for example, has a wetter climate than many locations in the United 
States. Therefore, the wood in many pianos manufactured for use in Japan 
has been dried out more than the wood used to make pianos for use in the 
U.S. If you live in the U.S. and you buy a piano made for use in Japan, you may 
face some serious problems with the wood parts of your piano drying out.

Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
Many manufacturer websites allow you to trace the serial number of your 
piano, so you can check the vintage and country of birth for a piano you’re 
looking at.
Getting all the pedals you deserve
Some underhanded dealers claim that they can save you money by offering 
you a piano with no middle pedal. Baloney! You may never use the middle 
pedal, but just in case Lang Lang comes over for lunch, you need to have one.
	
Getting a middle pedal isn’t like adding a sunroof to a new car. Three piano 
pedals shouldn’t be optional or part of a special package that costs more; 
three pedals are part of the overall purchase. If you want three pedals, ask to 
see piano models with three pedals.
Many upright pianos just don’t have a middle pedal. So, if the piano you want 
is an upright with only two pedals, it’s probably perfectly fine. Just ask about 
the third pedal to be on the safe side.
Finding good buys and avoiding scams
If you shop around and find a piano for a ridiculously low price — far lower 
than the same model anywhere else in town — it’s either used, broken, or a 
Memorial Day sale to really remember.
If you decide to shop for a used acoustic piano, be patient and take a look 
at a variety of instruments. There are many very good pianos out there, and 
sometimes people need to sell them because they don’t play them anymore, 
they’re moving, or they need to make room for a new 70-inch HDTV setup. 
And if you’ve found your dream piano at a garage sale, the low, low price is 
not necessarily an indication of anything wrong. It’s a garage sale! You may 
just find a perfectly good piano with many glorious years left in it for a 
fraction of the cost of a new one.
	
Be smart about any deal that seems too good to be true. If most stores offer a 
certain model for $20,000 and suddenly you’re staring at the same model at 
PianoMax for $5,000, something’s wrong. The soundboard may be cracked. It 
may be missing strings. Who knows? Hire a professional to look the piano over 
before you purchase it. (See Book I Chapter 4 for more information on finding 
piano technicians.)
	
Demo models are also good buys. Stores frequently loan pianos to local universi­
ties or concert halls for use by students, competitions, and guest artists. Even if 
it has been used only one time, the piano can no longer be sold as new. Of course, 
pianos don’t have odometers, so you have to take the dealer’s word for just how 
used a piano really is, but most dealers will be honest about this point.

If you’ve heard one, you haven’t 
heard them all
Not only do different brands sound completely different, but the sound of 
two pianos made by the same company can sound and feel different, too. 
This is why you must, must, must put your hands and ears on every piano you 
consider. Play every darn key, and play at all volumes. Many pianos sound 
beautiful except for one key. If you don’t play every key at the store, you’ll 
notice the bad key after you get the piano home.
Play and listen to those keys again and again. Trust your instincts. Don’t be 
rushed. Only you know what you like. Some people don’t like the sound of a 
Steinway; some don’t like a Baldwin. You’re entitled to your own taste.
Looking at specific piano brands
The following are some good brands of pianos from around the world. Contact 
these companies directly and ask where to find their pianos in your area.

Selecting a Digital Keyboard That Lasts
After much deliberation, and for whatever reasons, you decide to buy a digi­
tal keyboard over an acoustic one. Think your job is done? Not so fast, pal. 
Now you must decide what type of digital keyboard you want:
	
✓	Digital pianos and organs
	
✓	Arrangers
	
✓	Stage pianos
	
✓	Workstations
	
✓	Synthesizers
	
Don’t assume that you’ve necessarily gone the cheaper route by selecting a 
digital keyboard as your instrument of choice. These instruments can be quite 
expensive, sometimes costing more than an acoustic piano. But they’re also 
very versatile. Instead of being limited to the sound of a piano, you can have 
literally hundreds or even thousands of different sounds at your fingertips.
The number of sounds you can use depends on the type of keyboard you 
select. Just like computers, digital keyboards have memory, storage space, 
and performance limitations. Some you can add memory and sounds to, but 
some are what they are and no more.
Sorting out all the different keyboard types and styles can leave your mind 
numb. But here are a few things you can count on:
	
✓	All digital keyboards today use sampled sounds, which vary in quality.
	
✓	You can choose from a variety of keyboard actions, or touch sensitivity — 
everything from nonresponsive action to weighted-action keyboards 
designed to mimic the touch and feel of an acoustic piano.
	
✓	The three common keyboard sizes are standard 61-key, 76-key, and 
88-key.
	
✓	Digital keyboards have varying degrees of portability.
	
✓	Nearly all models come with a music rack, a plug-in sustain pedal, and 
MIDI (see the later section “The MIDI Places You Can Go”) and/or USB 
connection capability.
Although the lines between digital keyboard categories are increasingly blurred, 
you can still find clear differences when it comes to sequencing capabilities, 
built-in speakers, sound effects, metronomes, auto-accompaniment features, 
recording features, extra pedals, and other plug-in devices. The following 
­sections get more in-depth about the differences of these ­digital keyboards.

Digital pianos and organs
The two types of digital piano or organ for home use are
	
✓	Portable models.
	
✓	Upright and grand models.
Not surprisingly, the portables are more portable than the uprights and 
grands, which are designed after their acoustic sisters and are meant to 
occupy a relatively permanent spot in your home, not unlike an upright or 
grand piano. Both come with built-in speakers, although the speakers are 
smaller on the portable models. Both usually offer a few sound options like 
acoustic piano, electric piano, organ, and maybe vibes. They come with a 
music rack, a stand (if it’s not part of the keyboard), and a plug-in pedal.
If you’re looking exclusively for a digital organ, some very attractive models 
come with dual manuals and multiple organ effects like draw bars and rotary 
sound.
Arrangers
If you’re looking to have lots of fun with different sounds and accompani­
ment features and you’re not concerned with finding the best acoustic piano 
samples, an arranger is the digital keyboard for you. This type is loaded 
with “one-man band” features, like scads of sounds (500 or more); automatic 
drum, bass, and chord accompaniment; and recording and playback. Lower-
end models are quite inexpensive and very portable.
Stage pianos
These keyboards, made for onstage performing, offer more professional key­
board sounds. If you’re going to be the keyboard player in a band, or even a 
solo act, and will be gigging around town, the stage piano may be the choice 
for you. It doesn’t have built-in speakers, so you need to have an external 
amplifier and speaker to hear yourself play, but you can plug in headphones. 
Also, a stage piano doesn’t have as many functions as an arranger. Stage 
pianos come with a music rack and sustain pedal, but you need to purchase a 
keyboard stand and other accessories separately.

54
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
Workstations
Essentially a computer built into a keyboard, a workstation has everything: 
top-of-the-line sound samples, sequencing, recording and editing, and com­
puter integration. These babies can be quite expensive, but if you’ve got big 
musical dreams, you may want to try one out.
Synthesizers
You can still buy a good ol’ synthesizer and manipulate waveforms and filters, 
and work with both analog and digital sounds. Today’s synthesizers come 
with more sounds to work with than older models, letting you go to town with 
some good preset sounds.
Avoiding obsolescence
As with computers, keyboards become outdated as quickly as they reach the 
stores. But keyboard manufacturers are constantly trying to make products 
that won’t become obsolete by creating keyboards that can be upgraded or 
added to as technology advances.
	
Ask the manufacturer or a salesperson the following questions:
	
✓	Can I add memory? Adding memory to keyboards is quite common 
these days. More memory means the ability to accommodate new 
sounds, software, and hardware at a later date. Also ask what the 
memory limitations are.
	
✓	Is the unit upgradeable? Workstations offer operating system and soft­
ware upgrades, making it easy to keep up with the latest improvements.
	
✓	Can I purchase extra sound cards or libraries? Many workstations 
have vast libraries of sounds. Whether they’re developed by the original 
manufacturer or other sound developers, you can add extra sound cards 
and libraries to make old keyboards sound new again.
	
✓	Is the company still making this model or series? If not, the keyboard 
is already headed toward the land of obsolescence. But if it meets all 
the other criteria on this list and you can get it for a good price, just add 
memory, upgrades, and sounds over the years.

Knowing the digital features you want
Make a list of the digital keyboard features that are important to you before 
you even start shopping. This list can be different for each user. As technol­
ogy expands, more and more keyboards feature all kinds of nice little bells 
and whistles. This list runs through digital keyboard features and tells you 
which keyboards to turn to for them:
	
✓	Realistic piano sound: Look at the home digital pianos with the best 
piano samples.
	
✓	Realistic piano action: Look at the home digital pianos with the best 
touch-sensitive keyboards and the best weighted-key action.
	
✓	Built-in speakers: Home digital pianos, for sure.
	
✓	To perform onstage: Look at stage pianos, and keep in mind that you 
also need amplification.
	
✓	Portability: Look at stage pianos and arrangers.
	
✓	Multi-note polyphony: Look at home digital pianos, stage pianos, and 
workstations. The bigger the number, the more notes you can play at 
once, so try for at least 32-note polyphony. Sure, you don’t have 32 fingers, 
but if you use MIDI, 32-note polyphony comes in handy. Some models even 
have 128-note polyphony, which is excellent.
	
✓	Multi-timbral: Look at arrangers and workstations for this ability to 
play more than one sound at the same time. For example, you can play 
sounds from a piano, a violin, a banjo, and a bagpipe together on “Danny 
Boy.”
	
✓	MIDI capability: Nowadays, they all have this. Read more about MIDI 
later in this chapter in the section “The MIDI Places You Can Go.”
	
✓	Pitch bend and modulation: Look at arrangers, synthesizers, and work­
stations to make your sounds say “wah wah” and “woob woob.”
	
✓	Sound editing: Look at workstations if you want to change the sounds, 
making the piano brighter, the horns brassier, and the goose calls 
goosier, for example.
	
✓	Internal recording, editing, and sequencing: Want to record what 
you play without using external recorders or a computer? You need a 
sequencer, which most digital keyboards have, but only workstations 
have the most advanced editing and sequencing features.
	
✓	Automatic rhythm, harmony, and bass accompaniment: Look at 
arrangers.

56
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
✓	Strange sound effects: Look at synthesizers if you want to program your 
own sounds. Be aware that some synthesizers are monophonic, meaning 
they can play only one note at a time.
	
✓	Other mumbo-jumbo: Flash ROM, DSP plug-ins, BIAS Peak, sub-oscillators, 
vocoders, modeling filters, arpeggiators — all this is very cool, but what 
does it have to do with you playing music? Not much. It simply indicates 
that your model is on the cutting edge of current keyboard features.
	
Whichever way you go, ask yourself this important question before you buy: 
Do you like the keyboard as an instrument? Take your time and make sure it 
sounds good to your ears. If the in-store keyboard is hooked up to an external 
amplifier and speaker, ask the salesperson if you can listen to the keyboard 
through an amp and speaker similar to what you’ll be using — or headphones. 
Also consider whether the keyboard looks good, and whether you’ll enjoy 
having it in your home where you’ll feel comfortable and free to practice and 
play. And does the keyboard do what you want it to do, whether that’s sound 
like an organ, a string section, or an alien band from a distant galaxy?

Before You Drive It Off the Lot: 
Sealing the Deal
If you’ve ever bought a car, you know that looking at and test-driving different 
models is almost as much fun as taking one home. Buying a keyboard should 
be a similar experience.
Take it for a spin
No matter what kind of music store you walk into, the pianos and keyboards 
are there for you to try out. Go ahead — touch it, play it. Push the buttons 
and turn the volume up and down. If it’s a piano, have a seat and play a while. 
It’s just you and the keyboard . . . and perhaps a dozen other customers and 
salespeople standing around listening.
	
Keep in mind that many digital keyboards on display are routed through pro­
cessors, effects, and other digital enhancements to make them sound better. 
Don’t be fooled by this extra gear. Kindly ask the salesperson to turn off all 
effects so that you can hear the keyboard as is. Otherwise, you may be disap­
pointed with the way it sounds after you get it home — unless, of course, you 
also buy all the effects and processors.

58
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
Notice the following about each piano or keyboard you try:
	
✓	Is the overall sound full or wimpy, bright or dull?
	
✓	Do long notes actually last as long as you play them?
	
✓	On an acoustic piano, do the top five keys sound good, not metallic? 
Do the lower five keys sound good, not thick and sloppy?
	
✓	Do you get a quick response when you play the keys? Is the keyboard 
too sensitive, or not sensitive enough?
	
✓	Do your fingers have enough room on the keys?
Love it and leave it
You found the perfect keyboard for you, and you’re in love. This is the one. 
Now leave the store quickly with a tip of your hat and a polite “I’ll think about 
it” to the hovering sales manager.
	
You’re in trouble if you sit down and negotiate the first time you walk into the 
store. You’re too emotionally attached to think clearly. This is love — true 
love. Your keyboard is your baby. Before negotiating a price, leave the store 
and spend the next few hours or days searching for that identical piano at a 
lower price. When you’re 100 percent sure that you can’t find it cheaper and 
still can’t live without it, head back to the store and start negotiating.
Never pay the sticker price
Many people think that the art of negotiating a price is reserved for car buying. 
On the contrary, the wonderful world of instruments and accessories is open 
for price haggling. The sticker price is merely a starting point. If the price of 
that baby grand you want is $15,000, you could find yourself taking it home 
(in a very big truck) for as low as $10,000.
Generally, you can hope to get anywhere from 10 to 15 percent off the sticker 
price. The closer you pay to the dealer’s asking price, the more likely the 
salesperson is to throw in freebies like delivery to your home — which can 
sometimes cost as much as $300 — or a free year of tuning, piano cleaner, or 
fuzzy dice. A deal can work the other way, too: If you’re buying accessories 
like a keyboard stand, amplifier, some software, and some cables, the 
salesperson will be more receptive to making a deal.
Go in the store with an absolute maximum dollar amount in your head. When 
you’re sure about a particular model, sit down with the salesperson and ask what’s 
the best he can do on that model piano. If you get an answer equal to or less than 
the maximum figure in your head, shake hands and write the check. If the price is

nowhere close to what you’re comfortable paying, stand up and say, “Well, thank 
you very much. You have my number if you change your mind.” Remember, there 
are more piano stores and more piano models in this world.
	
A piano store is a store like any other, complete with sales at key times during 
the year. For example, Memorial Day is always a big piano-buying time. Shop 
around, and then keep an eye out for sales and promotions.
Shopping online
Surfing the Internet can be great for comparing keyboards and getting a 
handle on digital lingo. Virtual showroom tours, product demonstrations, and 
used and new price quotes abound. You can certainly find some available 
models that your local dealer doesn’t carry and preview some models and 
features that manufacturers are planning to introduce.
	
One good place to check out what other people think about particular models 
is YouTube (www.youtube.com). Go to the search box at the top of the page 
and enter the brand and model you want to check out and add the words 
“unboxing” or “review.” You’ll likely get several videos of people testing out 
and commenting on your model.
As you start to focus on a few keyboards that interest you, read the FAQ and 
product specifications on the manufacturer websites (refer to the contact 
listings earlier in this chapter). Look at what models are being sold as used, 
and why. Study up on the features that interest you so that, when you go to 
a dealer, you’ll be treated as an informed customer and not a know-nothing 
who can be suckered into a bad deal. And read customer reviews.
	
You can buy online, and in some cases pay less doing so, but it’s important to 
keep in mind the limitations. Only a dealer can give you product support, 
answer your questions, and offer you a store warranty so that you can bring 
your instrument back for repairs or problems.
	
Because you do want to try out any instrument before you buy it, consider 
shopping Craigslist (www.craigslist.org) to find used instruments near 
where you live. That way you can hop in the car and go check them out.
The MIDI Places You Can Go
Your new digital or hybrid keyboard is wonderful — exactly what you wanted. 
But now you want to experiment with all the cool things you’ve heard about. 
This section explains several other types of musical devices, including MIDI 
and other recording systems, that can hook up to your new keyboard and that 
help you go even farther in your pursuit of a musical career — or just your 
desire to get the most out of your keyboard.

60
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
After you start investing in recording software and equipment, two things 
happen: You spend far less time practicing music and far more time studying 
up on new technology, and your bank account shrinks. For now, it’s nice to 
know these recording options exist, but consider playing music for a while 
before diving into a new career as a recording engineer.
A mini MIDI primer
MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It’s not nearly as boring as 
it sounds. In fact, MIDI (pronounced mid-ee) can change your musical life.
In a nutshell, MIDI enables you to connect and communicate with other key­
boards, your computer, or other digital equipment from your digital or hybrid 
keyboard. Suppose you have three keyboards. You select the first one to be 
the controller and set it to sound like a piano. You connect the other two key­
boards to the controller and set each of them to different sounds, perhaps a 
flute and a tuba. As you play the controller, the other two keyboards are sent 
MIDI messages (binary codes) telling them which notes to play, how long, 
how loud, and so on. But it sounds like three players are playing three 
separate instruments, instead of just you on a piano.
But that’s not all MIDI can do. By connecting a MIDI cable to your computer, 
you can record, edit, and notate your music using software programs on your 
computer. You can buy MIDI-recorded CDs and hear the songs played with 
the sounds of your own keyboard. Hybrid pianos and player piano systems 
also use MIDI to communicate with other digital equipment. MIDI software 
and recordings have become quite popular teaching aids because you can 
follow along note for note as your keyboard plays the songs.
Keyboard to computer
Digital keyboards offer you a host of options that help you record your music. 
You can record directly on your keyboard, or you can record by connecting 
your keyboard to your computer using MIDI cables. If you use MIDI, you can 
record exactly what you play without any fancy recording equipment. The 
MIDI messages you send from your keyboard as you play can be recorded in 
a computer or sequencer. Later, all you do is push “play” on the sequencer 
and hear note for note, volume for volume, exactly what you played.
There are many types of recording and sequencing software programs for 
your computer that give you recording and editing options that may not be 
available on your keyboard.

61
 Chapter 3: Choosing and Buying Your Keyboard

Digital recording and sequencing programs allow you to record on several 
­different tracks. So, you can record yourself playing the melody of a song with a 
piano sound on track 1, followed by the drum part on track 2, and then the guitar 
part on track 3. But you never use any instrument other than your ­keyboard and 
the sounds that came with it. Play back the recording, or sequence, and it plays 
all three tracks at once, which sounds like a four-member band. Want more? Just 
add some violins on track 4. Perhaps the sound of rain on track 5. Pretty soon 
you’ve got the entire London Philharmonic ­playing on tracks 6 through 16.
Software programs allow you to edit, transpose, speed up, or slow down what 
you’ve recorded. You can also alter the volume levels on each track and add 
sound effects, like reverb, to enhance what you’ve played. But wait! There’s 
more! You can purchase or even download MIDI files that you can load into 
your recording software so you can play along with files and add new tracks 
on top.
Keyboard to keyboard
You can connect your MIDI keyboard with another MIDI keyboard, or build a 
chain of three or more. Set each keyboard with a different sound patch, and 
play all the keyboards at once from your main, controller keyboard. See what 
it sounds like to combine piano and string sounds, brass and electric guitar, 
you name it.
MIDI and music notation
Music notation programs are a great tool to help you learn and improve your 
music reading and writing skills. When you hook up your MIDI keyboard to a 
computer and open up notation software, you can write music, read music, 
and play back whatever you’re working on. Plenty of educational programs are 
available to help you with the basics of music notation; some are interactive 
and make learning fun. And don’t forget that you can use notation programs to 
write out your latest opus so you can share your music with other musicians.

The Setup and Care of 
Your Instrument
In This Chapter
▶	Getting the keyboard (and its miscellany) out of the package and assembled
▶	Finding the right spot for your keyboard
▶	Cleaning your keyboard
▶	Realizing when you can’t fix it yourself
▶	Making electrical and audio connections
▶	Maintaining your keyboard and fixing minor problems
S

o you’ve chosen the right instrument for your needs and have brought it 
home to start making music. Where will you be able to focus on playing, 
practicing, and enjoying making music without distraction (and without 
­distracting others)?
This chapter discusses how to set up your piano or keyboard, how to safely 
move it around, and how to keep it in tip-top shape. You’ll also find out about 
the various types of keyboard connections (and connectors) that allow you to 
hook up to other gear to hear your keyboard in open air. The chapter talks a 
little bit about electrical safety and some best practices when using powered 
electrical gear. And you’ll find out how to get help when you have a problem.
Unboxing Your New Keyboard
In the excited rush of opening up your new instrument, you may actually 
miss some important in-box element of your purchase. And the last thing you 
want is to injure yourself before you even get a chance to play. This section 
offers a few pointers.

64
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
Your keyboard comes wrapped in some type of plastic bag or material and has 
molded foam end caps on both ends to protect it and hold it in place in the 
box. What many people often miss is that some important accessory may also 
be located in the end of the foam insert. So look carefully at both end pieces.
Besides the keyboard itself (including the stand assembly if it’s a home digital 
piano), look for the following items (not all will apply to your chosen model; 
check the beginning of your owner’s manual for more information):
	
✓	Power cable or external power supply: Some of these connectors 
are two-piece affairs, with the larger, rectangular piece plus a second 
cable that connects between it and the outlet (like you see with some 
laptops).
	
✓	Owner’s manual or operation guide: Your keyboard package includes 
some sort of documentation (traditionally a printed hard copy) to help 
you operate it. These instructions may be a complete owner’s manual 
or just a brief getting-started guide to help you with only the most basic 
tasks. These booklets commonly show up in a clear bag, which may also 
include a warranty card and perhaps a CD-ROM. This disc likely contains 
most of your needed documentation — the owner’s manual, a deeper 
parameter guide (which explains each and every function and parameter 
of the product), a voice/sound name list, and other documents.
	
	Note: To keep costs down, many manufacturers are moving toward 
including fewer printed materials and providing lengthier documenta­
tion as an electronic PDF file. Go to www.adobe.com/reader to down­
load the free Adobe Reader application if you don’t have it.
	
	Products often change, adding new features and fixing mistakes in docu­
mentation. A newer version of your keyboard’s document(s) may be 
available for download from the manufacturer’s website.
	
✓	Warranty card: A warranty card registers your ownership of the product 
with the manufacturer, ensuring your coverage for repairs/problems 
during a set time period the company offers. You aren’t actually required 
to fill in/return this type of card to be eligible for warranty coverage. 
Your proof of purchase (a store receipt is best) guarantees your cover­
age of whatever the manufacturer offers.
	
	Many manufacturers offer extended warranty time periods (usually 
double the regular time) if you go to their websites to fill out your war­
ranty info. This extension is a great benefit, and it’s free, so check into 
this possibility and take advantage if it’s available.
	
✓	Additional hardware: If you’ve bought a home digital piano with an 
included stand assembly, the screws, wing nuts, and other hardware 
connectors are in a separate bag somewhere in the box. Look carefully 
for any such items in the foam inserts or taped to the inside of the box.

65
 Chapter 4: The Setup and Care of Your Instrument
Book I
Piano & 
Keyboard

✓	Included sustain/damper pedal: If your keyboard is supposed to 
come with a pedal, that pedal will usually be in a white cardboard box 
within the shipping box. Sometimes these free pedals are only small flat 
switches, so the box can be small and easily overlooked.
	
✓	Additional cables: Some keyboards come with a USB cable for connect­
ing the instrument to your computer for MIDI and/or audio functionality. 
Although you may not require that capability right away, if it was prom­
ised to you, be sure to locate the cord.
	
✓	Bundled goods from the retailer: Some retailers put together special 
bundle promotions, where they add other goods (such as headphones, a 
carrying case, a stand, music books or software, and so on) to your package 
price. These items are always packed in one or more separate packages and 
either are given to you at the time of purchase or shipped at the same time. 
Look carefully for markings such as “Box 1 of x,” “Box 2 of x,” and so on.
Providing a Good Place to Put It
Whether you bought an acoustic or digital keyboard, the first thing to do 
when you get your new baby home is find a spot for it. This doesn’t have to 
be a permanent resting place. Your ideal spot will have these characteristics:
	
✓	No direct sunlight: Even through a window, overexposure to sun­
light can damage your keyboard over time. Direct sunlight can cause 
the wood to warp or dry out, affecting both the sound and overall 
appearance.
	
✓	Controlled climate: Don’t expose your keyboard to wide temperature 
swings. Don’t leave it on a porch that gets hot in the summer and cold in 
the winter. Place your keyboard near an interior wall rather than an exte­
rior wall. Wood responds to changes in humidity, so consider setting up 
a humidifier or dehumidifier if you and your acoustic piano live in a dry 
or wet climate. (Your piano tuner will be glad to advise you on humidi­
fiers and dehumidifiers for this purpose.)
	
✓	Good ventilation: For acoustic pianos, good ventilation reduces the 
buildup of excess moisture, which can affect the wood. For digital key­
boards, ventilation keeps the inner workings cooled when the power is 
on. But don’t put your keyboard right under an air conditioning unit or 
right over a heating duct.
	
✓	Safety: Don’t set your keyboard in a precarious position where it can get 
bumped, fall, or have something fall on it.
	
✓	Elbow room: When you feel cramped or uncomfortable, you’re more 
likely to avoid practicing. Lack of practice leads to poor playing, so give 
yourself ample space for stretching out when you play.

66
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
✓	Convenience: Make sure your room has plenty of electrical outlets. 
Using miles of extension cords is expensive, irritating, and ugly.
	
✓	Lighting: Until you’re in a dark, smoke-filled bar or in front of hundreds 
of adoring fans, you should always play with good lighting. Not only is 
it easier to see the keys with good light, but reading music is next to 
impossible in the dark. You can set a lamp on or near your keyboard, but 
not the clip-on kind, which can damage the keyboard’s finish.
	
Also keep in mind how the location of your piano or keyboard may impact 
your relationship with your neighbors. For example, don’t put your keyboard 
in the room right over your downstairs neighbor’s bedroom. All those practice 
sessions late at night will soon be history.
Making It Shine
A clean instrument sounds and looks better longer than one that’s 
neglected — both advantages that can affect its value if you ever need to sell 
it. You don’t have to go overboard when it comes to cleaning your acous­
tic piano or digital keyboard, but keep it free of dust and dirt as much as 
possible.
	
Don’t be afraid to lay down the law when it comes to keeping your instrument 
clean, insisting that no one (not even you) eats or drinks around your key­
board. A spilled drink in the back seat of your car is one thing; a spilled drink 
on your keyboard can be fatal (for the keyboard, that is). And do you really 
want to clean out cracker crumbs from between the keys once a month?
In addition to keeping food and drink away from your keyboard, don’t allow 
dust to build up on your instrument. Dust buildup may eventually short out 
the circuitry or cause the keys or buttons to stick. Either result is bad news. 
Cover your digital keyboard when you aren’t using it, either with a purchased 
dust cover or a homemade cover, like a sheet. Dust buildup in acoustic 
pianos isn’t as critical, but you should still keep it in check.
	
The two most important cleaning tools to have near your instrument are a 
feather duster and a small, medium-bristle paintbrush. At least once a month, 
use the feather duster for an overall dusting, followed by a detailing with the 
paintbrush, where you get in all the grooves and between the keys. Simply 
press down each key and clean both sides before moving to the next one. If 
you’re in a hurry, just run the brush in between the keys and give it a better, 
more thorough cleaning later. Digital keyboards have lots of little buttons, digi­
tal displays, knobs, sliders, and other gadgets; turn the power off and clean 
these with a dry, soft, lint-free rag every couple of months.

67
 Chapter 4: The Setup and Care of Your Instrument

Be careful what cleaning solvents you use on your keyboard’s finish. The wood 
finish on many grand pianos, for example, can be ruined by normal furniture 
polish. Ivory keys should be cleaned with a dry cloth or a cleaner made espe­
cially for them. (Products made for cleaning piano cases and keys are avail­
able online.) For most keyboards (acoustic or electric), use a cloth that’s 
slightly damp with plain soap and water (see the sidebar “Secret revealed: 
Special piano cleaner”). Don’t be embarrassed to ask the dealer what cleaning 
products are advised and exactly how to use them.
When using a liquid solution on the finish, whether soap and water or window 
cleaner (sometimes recommended, but ask first!), use an old T-shirt or lint-free 
rag instead of a paper towel. Fabric cloths don’t leave those little white fuzz balls 
as you clean. Don’t spray liquid cleaners directly on your instrument. Spray first 
onto your rag or cloth, and then wipe the instrument. Continue again and again 
until the instrument is clean, but make sure you wipe up any excess moisture.
Calling In a Pro for Tuning, Check-Ups, 
and Serious Repairs
Playing the keyboard is one thing. Knowing how to repair and maintain one is 
another. Leave such matters to a qualified professional. You have enough to 
worry about with playing, reading music, and touring around the world.
This section gives you tips on hiring piano tuners, piano technicians, key­
board technical support people, and others who can help you maintain and 
prolong your instrument’s life.
Secret revealed: Special piano cleaner
Your dealer may suggest you buy a special 
cleaner packaged in a very handy and attrac­
tive bottle. Having just written a very large 
check, you jump at the chance to protect your 
investment, never mind the added cost.
You get home and decipher the scientific ingre­
dient names on the label only to discover that 
you just purchased some expensive soap and 
water. Save your money and make your own 
by using the following: An empty spray bottle, a 
marker, liquid hand soap, and water.
Rinse out the spray bottle until it’s free of 
residue from any previous products. Use your 
marker to write “Piano Cleaner” on the outside. 
Add four or five squirts of soap to the bottle, 
and then fill it up with clean water. Shake well 
before spraying your rag and then wiping down 
your instrument.

Tuning pianos: Leave it to the experts
Okay, so your friend can tune his own guitar, violin, or clarinet. Keep in mind 
how much larger your piano is, how many parts are inside, and how much 
more you probably paid for it. Swallow your pride, pick up the phone, and 
call a piano technician when it’s time to tune your piano.
Piano technicians are skilled professionals with years of education and experi­
ence. It may look like the technician’s just playing keys and tightening screws, 
but you won’t even know where to begin if you try to do it yourself.
	
Don’t think that you’ll suddenly hear your piano go out of tune one day. Loss 
of intonation is a gradual process. Your tuning will be much overdue if you get 
to the point where you actually say to yourself, “Wow! My piano’s out of tune.” 
Schedule a tuning at least once a year — preferably twice a year. Generally, the 
visit will take two to three hours and cost you between $75 and $150, which is 
well worth the cost. After you establish a relationship with a technician, he or 
she will probably contact you each year, so you don’t even have to remember 
to schedule an appointment for a tuning.
	
Too many years of tuning neglect results in a piano that’s permanently out of 
tune. Ever heard an old honky-tonk saloon piano? Sure, the sound is sort of 
fun, but not when it’s coming from your $30,000 9-foot grand piano. Frequent 
tuning ensures that the pitch of your piano doesn’t drop (a condition that’s 
reparable but sometimes problematic) and that any problems with the tuning 
pins, which are tightened and loosened during tuning, or the pinblock, which 
holds the pins, can be fixed as they arise.
	
You can get recommendations for a good piano technician from friends, teach­
ers, music stores, and music schools. Check recommendations against the 
member directory of the Piano Technicians Guild at www.ptg.org, which 
includes individuals who have earned the distinction of Registered Piano 
Technician (RPT). Don’t just select at random from the phonebook; a bad 
technician can ruin a piano.
Ask the technician to have a look under the hood and make sure everything 
is functioning properly:
	
✓	Do the pedals work?
	
✓	Are the legs secure?
	
✓	Are there any problems with the action?
	
✓	Is the soundboard cracked?

Keeping digital keyboards happy
You don’t need to tune your digital keyboard. However, it does need some 
occasional attention. If you keep it clean and dust-free, chances are it will 
work and sound just fine for quite some time.
	
Over time, through constant pushing and pulling, the little buttons, digital dis­
plays, knobs, sliders, and other gizmos on a digital keyboard experience 
normal wear and tear. If a button appears to be stuck, don’t try to fix it your­
self with one of your own tools. Call a professional — perhaps the dealer who 
sold you the instrument or the manufacturer — for a dealer reference. For a 
minimal fee, the dealer can assess the damage (if any) and fix it for you. If your 
warranty is still good (usually only for one year), it could be free.
	
Never, ever, under any circumstances unscrew or open the top of your key­
board. Sure, it looks cool inside with all the computer chips and circuit 
boards. Sure, you think you know what you’re doing and want to save a buck 
by fixing a problem yourself. But opening up your keyboard voids your war­
ranty automatically and could damage your keyboard irreparably.
Dealing with serious problems
Unfortunately, some keyboard problems can arise that require some serious 
time, effort, and money to fix. If you experience any of the following problems, 
you should get estimates from at least two separate technicians before 
­deciding whether or not to salvage your instrument:
	
✓	The soundboard on your acoustic piano cracks or breaks. The sound­
board is the large, polished board under the strings. The soundboard 
can break during a move performed by unqualified movers. It can also 
break due to constant changes in humidity that cause the wood to swell 
and contract. Have your piano technician check out the soundboard for 
you during each tune-up.
Technical support lines
Each and every time you buy a new keyboard, 
fill out and send in the registration card that 
comes with it — or register online, if that’s an 
option. Don’t be afraid that you’ll be put on some 
mailing list; you’re simply telling the manufac­
turer, “Just letting you know that I bought your 
really cool product. Here’s my name and here’s 
where I live.” That’s all.
Then any time you have a problem with your 
instrument, you can call the manufacturer’s 
technical support line and speak with a knowl­
edgeable professional (maybe even someone 
who designed your keyboard) about the spe­
cific problem you’re having and how to rectify it. 
The call to technical support is usually free — if 
you’ve filled out that little card and mailed it in.

✓	You hear only a thump when you press an acoustic piano key. Either 
the hammer, damper, or both are not functioning properly. You may have 
to replace the mechanism for that one key or replace the entire set of 
keys and hammers. Hope for the first option. Of course, the culprit could 
also just be a broken string, which can be fixed for under $20.
	
✓	Your digital keyboard won’t power on. Your keyboard should always 
power on when plugged in correctly. If not, it may be dead.
	
✓	Your LCD display shows nothing legible. If the words and program 
names on the front panel display of your digital keyboard are suddenly a 
bunch of meaningless letters, the brains of your board may be fried.
	
✓	You spill liquid all over your digital keyboard. You probably just 
shorted out the entire board. Few, if any, of your buttons and keys are 
going to work. This is why you should never have a drink on or near 
your keyboard. The first thing to do is to shut the power off. Let it dry 
out completely (for days) before turning the power on again.
	
✓	You spill liquid on your acoustic piano. Quickly get a towel and start 
sopping it up. The wood, strings, hammers, and even keys may be dam­
aged, but at least there isn’t anything electrical to bug out.
How to move a piano
You must hire a qualified piano mover to trans­
fer your baby to its new home. Don’t be cheap 
about hiring a mover. Inexperienced movers 
can ruin your piano. And don’t ever try to move 
the piano by yourself or with friends.
Don’t watch the move. You should definitely be 
present to watch the movers and make sure they 
take extreme care when moving your precious 
baby. But you’re guaranteed to grimace when 
you see them flip that piano over on its side. Save 
yourself the emotional distress and just turn away.
Moving a grand piano involves its own special­
ized piece of equipment called a piano board. 
This long, flat board has lots of padding and 
several handles. The movers lay the piano on its 
side on this board and strap it all to a dolly. The 
piano board holds your baby securely and cush­
ions any jarring bumps. If your movers show 
up without a piano board, bid them farewell 
and call new movers. To move upright pianos, 
movers typically place the piano (upright!) on 
a flat dolly.
Your local piano dealer can recommend sev­
eral good moving companies that specialize in 
piano moving. The good ones actually receive 
endorsements from piano manufacturers.

Setting Up Your Keyboard
Any stand you use with your keyboard probably requires some assembly. But 
if you’re working with a home digital piano or very large arranger keyboard 
that comes with a custom stand as part of the package, it’s a good idea to 
connect the instrument to a power source to make sure it’s working okay 
before you assemble the stand and place the keyboard on it. You’d much 
rather find out you’ve got a bum keyboard before you put together the stand, 
especially a complicated one with lots of doodads.
You can easily look up the weight of your new keyboard to be sure the stand 
can hold it, but you also need to consider the amount of force and constant 
vibration that playing the keyboard is going to exert. A small child or deli­
cate player isn’t going to produce much extra pressure on the stand, but if 
you’re planning to play some bangin’ rock and roll, highly rhythmic funk, or 
dramatic classical pieces, you should seriously consider the sturdiness of 
your stand. The cheapest stands are an X design, with a simple cross brace 
underneath. These types are okay, but they’re not as sturdy and solid as a 
design that has at least four actual legs underneath. Check to see whether the 
keyboard/stand combo easily rocks back and forth (which you don’t want).
Stand height is another important consideration. Good piano technique 
requires that your arm is basically level from the elbow across to the hand, 
so position your stand accordingly (keeping in mind the height of the key­
board itself as well). Angling your hand downward or upward causes stress 
and can tire and even hurt your wrist muscles. When sitting, the chair, stool, 
or bench you use often determines stand height. However, you can adjust the 
height on fancier piano benches and many computer desk chairs.
When standing, the straight forearm rule applies, with the added issue that 
you’re more likely to cause the keyboard to vibrate or even move with your 
forceful playing. Be sure your stand doesn’t bounce too much or move 
around and that all connections are hand-tightened securely.
Hook Me Up: Keyboard Connections
Your keyboard is electronic, so you’re going to have to hook up some things 
before you can play. Even with just a little portable, you need to insert 
batteries to get started. The following sections cover the most common 
­connections you’ll encounter.

72
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
Making the electrical connection
Most people know not to stick their fingers, their tongues, or pointy objects 
into an outlet, but not everyone thinks carefully when plugging in power 
cables or adapters.
	
Always plug the power cable or power adapter into the keyboard before you 
plug it into the outlet. Don’t let your finger slip over to the prong or tip of the 
plug when pushing it in. Look to see whether the plug has one prong larger 
than the other (to ensure you’re grounded properly) before plugging it in.
Plugging a lot of devices into one outlet can be a fire hazard. Consider dis­
tributing them around to other outlets or even parts of your room/house if 
possible. Or buy multioutlet plugs that attach to the normal dual-outlet boxes 
found in the wall, giving you four or even six outlets. If you want to use one of 
these, be sure to secure it to the wall outlet with the long screw provided.
	
Many people choose to use a multioutlet strip that sits on the floor instead of 
crowding the wall outlet. If you do this, invest in an outlet strip that offers 
surge suppression or surge protection. This feature protects your gear from 
sudden spikes in the power that may damage your electronic keyboard.
	
That said, a strip-based surge protector won’t protect you if your house is 
struck by lightning; you need much more expensive and advanced gear for 
that level of safety. If a strong thunderstorm is reported in your area, unplug 
your valuable electronic devices (and appliances) until the storm passes.
Firing up your keyboard
This chapter can’t hope to explain each and every electronic keyboard and 
how they work. There’s no substitute for reading the manual that came with 
your product. Read through the opening section of your manual regarding 
connections and first-time use before officially starting up your keyboard.
Follow these steps to safely get your keyboard going:
	
1.	Plug in any pedals you have.
	
	 Look carefully on the back panel to be sure you’re plugging the pedal 
into the right jack. Read more about this hookup in your product’s own­
er’s manual or getting started guide.
	
2.	Find the main volume control and turn it all the way down.
	
	 This control may be labeled just Volume or Output.

73
 Chapter 4: The Setup and Care of Your Instrument
Book I
Piano & 
Keyboard 
101
	
3.	Locate the power switch or button; turn it on and wait for the 
­keyboard to fully boot up.
	
	 The on/off control may be on the front panel, around the back of the 
unit, or even on the side. Remember, some units take a few moments to 
fully wake up and be ready to play.
	
4.	Play a single note over and over while you raise the volume to your 
desired level.
	
5.	If your keyboard has built-in demos or songs, play one, step back a bit 
from it, and listen while adjusting the volume.
	
	 This step is a good way to enjoy your first listen to your new instrument 
in your home surroundings. Set the volume too loud, and you may find 
you start rattling pictures on the wall or disturbing some other item. 
Either batten down the offending vibrating object or lower the volume.
Working with headphones
Perhaps your keyboard doesn’t have onboard speakers, or you just want to 
enjoy some private practice time. Every electronic keyboard offers a head­
phone output for that purpose. (Often, if a keyboard does have onboard 
speakers, plugging a headphone in will automatically turn off the speakers. 
Smart, huh?)
	
Headphones bring the sound very close to your ears (and in the case of in-the-
ear varieties, right into the ear canal), so be careful about listening at high vol­
umes. Your hearing is precious and can easily be damaged by loud sound/
music. Try to set the volume as low as you can while still hearing and enjoying 
it rather than as loud as you can before causing pain/bleeding.
Headphones and headphone outputs use two types of connectors: 1/4-inch 
and 1/8-inch jacks (holes) and plugs (prongs). Here’s the breakdown:
	
✓	The most common musical instrument/audio connector is called the 
1/4-inch plug, or phone plug. It’s the largest plug used and makes a great 
connection because of its long shaft. It’s available in mono and stereo 
versions, so be sure you have the stereo version, indicated by dual black 
rings near the tip of the plug.
	
✓	The other common size is the 1/8-inch, also called a 3.5 mm or mini-plug. 
It’s the most common plug size for mobile phones, media players, and 
most earbud headphones. It makes a good connection but can be a bit 
fragile. Don’t tug on the cable or put pressure on this connection.

74
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
Your headphones may have a different-sized plug from your keyboard’s head­
phone output. Don’t worry. Adapters that convert between the two sizes are 
common. Find them at your local music or electronics store, or online.
Armed with the right headphones and cable/connector, you can now plug in 
the phones to your keyboard. Do so before you put them over your ears.
Connecting to external speakers and amps
If your keyboard doesn’t have onboard speakers and you want to share your 
playing with others (or you just don’t want to wear headphones), you can 
connect your instrument to a number of different devices or speakers. The 
main requirement is that the other device must have its own power source; 
your keyboard’s output signal isn’t strong enough to drive basic speakers. 
Luckily, almost every device you’re likely to choose from (home theater/
stereo, computer, or MP3 player’s speakers, or amplifier) fits that bill.
	
Here’s a general rule for turning electronics (such as your keyboard) and audio 
gear on and off when connected to a separate amplifier, powered speaker, or 
whatever: With both devices off, always turn on the sound-producing item first 
(the keyboard). Then turn on the amplifier/powered speakers. This order 
ensures that any pops or wake-up sounds the device makes don’t go out your 
speakers, possibly harming them or your hearing. When shutting down, turn 
off the amplifier/powered speakers first, followed by the sound-producing 
item. Just remember, first on, last off.
Connecting to your home stereo
All home stereo systems include some form of additional input, usually 
labeled as an AUX or Auxiliary input and sometimes Tape input. Home stereo 
audio/video gear commonly uses a different type of connector called an RCA 
plug, which has a small, thin plug connector surrounded by a metal shield. 
These plugs are mono, which means you need two cables to connect to your 
home stereo/theater device if you want to hear your keyboard coming out 
of both speakers. This plug makes a great connection because of its metal 
shield, which fits securely over the jack on the device you’re plugging into.
Here are the most common situations for connecting:
	
✓	If your keyboard has two 1/4-inch line outputs labeled L/Mono and R 
(left/mono and right), you need two cables that have male mono 1/4-inch 
plugs on one end and male RCA plugs on the other. (The terms female 
and male are used to describe jacks and plugs in the obvious way.) 
These are very common, easily found items.

75
 Chapter 4: The Setup and Care of Your Instrument
Book I
Piano & 
Keyboard 
101
	
✓	If your keyboard has a single stereo 1/8-inch jack (labeled as an output), 
you need a special type of Y cable that has a male stereo 1/8-inch plug 
on one end and splits out into two cables with male RCA plugs.
	
✓	If your keyboard offers no jack labeled as an output, you can use the 
headphone jack to connect to your stereo. If it’s an 1/8-inch jack, follow 
the advice in the preceding bullet. If it’s a 1/4-inch jack, you need a cable 
with a male stereo 1/4-inch plug on one end that breaks out into two 
male RCA plugs on the other. This Y cord is readily available in musical 
instrument stores and online.
	
Use a cable long enough to make the connection without requiring adapters or 
additional connectors. These items can weaken the signal and make noise. 
Brick-and-mortar stores may have limited selections of cable lengths, so if you 
can’t find the right cable length in a store, go online. Many companies offer a 
much wider variety of cable types and lengths on their websites than any local 
store carries. And many of the familiar-name stores offer a wider online selec­
tion than they carry in the store.
When you’re armed with the correct cables, here’s how to connect them:
	
1.	Make sure both devices are turned off and their volumes set to 0.
	
2.	Connect the L output of your keyboard to the L AUX In and the R 
output of your keyboard to the R AUX In.
	
3.	Turn on the keyboard first, waiting until it has fully powered up 
before moving on.
	
4.	Set your home stereo to AUX and then power it on.
	
5.	Bring the keyboard’s volume up to around 50 percent.
	
6.	While playing some notes on the keyboard, slowly bring up the home 
stereo volume to around 10 to 25 percent.
	
	 If you need a little more volume, go back to your keyboard and raise its 
output slightly.
Using your computer speakers
Computer speaker systems can range from sounding okay to very good. 
These speakers usually accept a single stereo 1/8-inch plug. The easiest con­
nection is if you have a stereo 1/8-inch output or headphone jack on your 
keyboard. Then you only need a long cable with a stereo 1/8-inch plug on 
each end. If that isn’t available, here are the two other common scenarios:
	
✓	The next easiest connection is to use the stereo 1/4-inch headphone 
output. This option requires a male stereo 1/4-inch plug on one end with 
a male stereo 1/8-inch plug on the other.

76
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
✓	You can use the two 1/4-inch main outputs if you really want to, but this 
strategy is the least desirable of those presented here. To go this route 
requires a Y cable that joins two mono 1/4-inch plugs into a single male 
stereo 1/8-inch jack — more complicated than necessary.
After you’ve got everything connected, follow the instructions from the pre­
ceding section for powering on and setting volume.
Plugging into amps and other 1/4-inch jack devices
Musical instrument amplifiers, powered speakers, and mixers and speak­
ers (PA systems) all use 1/4-inch jacks for their inputs. The main distinction 
for you is whether the device is stereo or mono. Many keyboard and guitar 
amplifiers you find in a musical instrument store are mono. If you have only 
one powered speaker, you’ll be playing in mono.
	
Your keyboard always sounds better when connected in stereo, but if you have 
to, you can listen to it in mono. Some better keyboard amps are stereo devices; 
even if they have only one cabinet, they still have dual speakers inside. These 
amps are better for keyboards than a mono keyboard or guitar amplifier. In the 
case of powered speakers, you can always buy and use two separate speakers 
to fully reproduce the stereo image your keyboard delivers. And you could 
always plug the right channel into one guitar amp and the left into another.
To connect in mono, use the line output labeled L/Mono. This output treats 
the internal signal properly for listening in mono, so you don’t lose any of the 
frequencies or information. This output is almost always a 1/4-inch jack, so 
use a common male 1/4-inch to male 1/4-inch instrument cable, sometimes 
referred to as unbalanced or guitar cables.
Some smaller portables and digital pianos with onboard speakers don’t have 
line outputs, so your only choice is the headphone jack. In this case, you need a 
cable that has the matching connector to your headphone jack (male 1/4-inch or 
1/8-inch) with the mono 1/4-inch plug on the other end. It doesn’t really matter 
whether the headphone plug is stereo because you won’t be reproducing that 
imaging anyway. You’ll more commonly find a mono 1/4-inch or 1/8-inch plug to 
the mono 1/4-inch plug you need for the amp/powered speaker.
If you need to use a PA system (possibly in your church, school, coffeehouse, 
or bar), connect your 1/4-inch line outputs to two channels of the mixer, 
which always has 1/4-inch jacks. Two normal line/instrument cables will do. 
Locate a control called pan and set one channel all the way left and the other 
all the way right so your sound comes out of both speakers in true stereo. 
Some mixers have stereo channels, which simply means that one channel can 
accept two 1/4-inch inputs and doesn’t need the individual pan control(s). It 
will have a knob called balance, which should be kept straight up.

Protecting Your Investment: 
Care and Upkeep
Your electronic keyboard doesn’t require much maintenance; that’s one of 
the major advantages of it over an acoustic or electro-mechanical instrument. 
That said, it’s not indestructible.
	
Water and electronics don’t mix! Don’t douse your instrument with water 
while cleaning or keep any drinks, vases, or calming waterfalls near it. Be on 
the lookout for children and overly zealous house/party/club guests carrying 
beverages near your prized possession. If anything liquid does spill on the 
keyboard, turn the instrument off immediately, unplug it, and wipe up the spill 
with a soft cloth. If you fear any liquid got inside the case, don’t use the key­
board again until a skilled technician can look inside and assess the possible 
damage.
Avoiding temperature extremes
A keyboard doesn’t operate well in extreme temperature conditions, period. 
The most common scenario is leaving it in your car when you move it to 
bring it to a friend’s house or to a place you’re going to play. Closed cars can 
get very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. Get to where you’re 
going and take the keyboard out of the car right away. Never leave it in the 
car overnight; always bring it into the building.
	
Be especially careful about the display and other plastic parts, which can dis­
figure easily in extremely hot, direct sunlight. If you’re playing outside, try to 
ensure that the stage area is under some shade.
If the keyboard has been exposed to very cold conditions, allow it to come 
back to room temperature before turning it on. Changes in temperature can 
cause condensation to build up. Be sure to wipe off any you see.
Combating dust with a keyboard cover
A little dust or dirt on the outside of the case looks sloppy, but the real prob­
lem occurs when that grime gets into the buttons, switches, and sliders; 
inside the case; or stuck between the keys. These items can all quit working 
reliably when blocked by these contaminants.

78
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
Acoustic pianos and some digital pianos have a folding or sliding lid to cover the 
keys. Always keep this cover closed to protect the keys when you aren’t playing.
If you plan to leave your instrument in the open and it doesn’t have a built-in 
cover, throw a cloth or towel over it. Or buy a dust cover for your model.
Cleaning the keys and case
From time to time, dust and fingerprints show up on your instrument. The 
case, the keys, and especially a touch display need to be cleaned periodically. 
If water is a no-go, what should you use?
Most manufacturers recommend a soft, dry cloth to begin with. Try dispos­
able feather dusters to remove light dust or dirt. Start from the back of the 
key and wipe forward, so you’re bringing any dust/dirt particles forward to 
the edge of the key where you can remove them. If dust has gotten into the 
knobs or sliders, you can use compressed air to blow them clean. Look for 
products that were designed for computers, cameras, and electronics.
You can graduate to a slightly dampened cloth if needed as long as you wring 
out most of the liquid. For tough stains, you can use a mild, nonabrasive 
cleanser in the cloth. Never use any form of benzene, thinner, alcohol, or sol­
vent on the keys or case. These products can mar or disfigure the plastic.
	
A dry microfiber cloth, like you’d use for eyeglasses, is the best solution for 
touchscreens. Any good dry product for cleaning eyeglasses is going to be 
safe. Some of the well-known cleaning products companies make electronic 
wipes or electronic cleaning cloths that are safe for computer screens, key­
board displays, and the like.
Moving from place to place
If you plan to transport your keyboard often, you should invest in a case or 
padded carrying bag for it. These items protect the keyboard from scratches 
and worse while making it easier to lift and carry. A thickly padded bag is fine 
for most situations, but if you need to stack a lot of things in the car and want 
to put stuff on top of the keyboard, look for bags that offer a solid or rein­
forced wall design, or consider getting a hard-shell case.
	
You may think there’s no harm in just setting your smaller portable on the 
backseat while you make the short trip to practice, but you never know when 
you may need to slam on the brakes. The jerk who cut you off probably won’t 
care that your keyboard just went crashing onto the floor, but you will. Better 
to put it safely in the trunk for the trip.

79
 Chapter 4: The Setup and Care of Your Instrument
Book I
Piano & 
Keyboard 
101
For heavy keyboards, look into rolling bags or cases, which have sturdy 
wheels on one end so you don’t have to carry the instrument when going 
along flat surfaces. If you need to carry more gear than just the keyboard, 
consider getting a folding rolling cart or convertible hand truck.
Whatever you choose, don’t be afraid to ask someone for help when lifting 
a larger keyboard onto a stand, taking it down again, carrying a case, and 
taking it out/putting it into your car.
Solving Minor Technical Problems
As with any electronic device, sometimes things go wrong with a keyboard. It 
may show funny symbols in its display, lock up or freeze, or simply not make 
sound. Perhaps you’re just not sure how to do something or whether your 
keyboard can even do what you’re thinking of. Here are a few tips to help you 
figure out what’s wrong and what to do:
	
✓	If you hear anything funny or the unit freezes, the first action you take 
should be to turn it off, wait a few moments, and then turn it back on 
again. (Don’t forget to turn the volume down on all your speakers and 
such). Sometimes the device just needs a fresh reboot.
	
✓	If restarting doesn’t resolve the issue, look to your manual. Most owner’s 
manuals include a basic troubleshooting section toward the back that 
goes over the most common scenarios users face. It may show you how 
to reinitialize the instrument, which resets it to factory status.
	
✓	If you’ve spilled any liquid in your keyboard or think something (dust, 
dirt, bugs, small candy, or whatever) has gotten inside the case, never 
try to open the unit yourself to look inside. Even with the unit off and 
the power cable removed from the wall, the insides of any electronic 
device aren’t a safe place. You can get shocked or hurt worse by touch­
ing the wrong thing, not to mention that you’ll instantly void your war­
ranty coverage. Leave this type of work to the professionals!
	
✓	Go online to the manufacturer’s website and look in the support section 
for any frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to your product. As 
the name implies, these queries come up all the time, so the company 
writes good explanations to keep from answering the same questions 
over and over.
	
✓	Search the web for your problem using your favorite search engine. Make 
sure the most pertinent keywords are in your search text, including the 
brand name, model name and number, and main issue terms.

80
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
	Many brands have growing online communities, often not run by or 
directly affiliated with the company itself. These outlets can be great 
places to not only find answers to your problems but also meet other 
owners and share the fun of your product and music in general. Be sure 
to search these sites for answers before asking a question; often, the 
issue has come up before and has already been addressed. You may also 
want to try searching the web for general keywords such as “digital 
piano,” “synthesizer,” or “arrangers.”
	
✓	If you still can’t find your answer, try contacting the manufacturer’s 
product support or customer service department. These departments 
often post their hours of operation and methods of contact on the 
company website. You may be able to e-mail the company or fill out an 
online form, which can save you a lot of hold time waiting on the phone.
	
	Know that these replies can often come hours, if not days, after you 
submit them, so if you absolutely need to get help right away, call and 
stay on the line. Be patient; expect that it’s going to take some time to 
reach someone, so don’t get frustrated right away.

ou’re staring at all these keys, trying to make sense of the whole thing, 
and you’re wondering why you didn’t just buy a pair of cymbals and call 
it a day. It seems quite intimidating, but to paraphrase The Jackson Five: It’s 
as easy as A-B-C, 1-2-3.
This chapter helps you get acquainted with all the finer features of your 
keyboard, including the keys and the pedals. It also advises you on equip­
ment, such as chairs, benches, and racks, that aid you in achieving proper 
piano-playing posture, and explains just what that posture looks like. This is 
also where you’ll first encounter notes and note names, and which keys play 
which notes. In the next book — Book II — you’ll find out a whole lot more 
about that. Here the idea is to get your feet wet and absorb the very basics of 
how playing notes on the keyboard works.
Blake’s E-Z Key Finder
The first thing you notice on your keyboard is the not-so-colorful use of black 
and white keys aligned from left to right. The black ones are raised and are 
set farther back than the white ones, as you can see in Figure 5-1. (If the black 
and white keys are reversed, you’re either playing a very old keyboard or the 
­manufacturer messed up and you got an enormous discount. Congratulations!)

82
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
Figure 5-1: 
Your basic 
set of black 
and whites.
	
Each key on the keyboard represents a specific musical note. These notes use 
a very easy naming system — the first seven letters of the alphabet, A-B-C-D-
E-F-G. The names of the keys correspond to the names of musical notes. (The 
chapters in Book II go into a lot more detail on this.) For now, just remember 
that a G key plays a G note, an A key plays an A note, and so on.
But if you’re looking at 88 keys, and only have seven alphabet letters to name 
them, how do you name the other 81 keys? For all 88 keys, the basic set of 
seven letter names repeats over and over, in octaves, which are groups of eight.
	
When you name the sequence of seven white keys from A to G, the next 
(eighth) note is A as the series begins again. You can count seven octaves 
from the lowest A to the highest A on an 88-key piano.
The following sections show you how to use Blake’s E-Z Key Finder technique 
to locate the different notes on the keyboard. It’s an unforgettable way to find 
any key on the board.
The white keys
To make things really easy, the seven note names (A-B-C-D-E-F-G) are all on 
the white keys. The black keys have names of their own, covered in the next 
section, but for now you can use the black keys as landmarks to find the 
­correct white keys . . . even in the dark! The raised black keys help you locate 
any white key quickly and precisely.
The black keys always appear in repeating groups of two and three. You’ll 
never see two sets of two black keys or two sets of three black keys in a row. 
This distinction of twos and threes is important and makes the job of finding 
white keys even easier.
	
Use your imagination and think of any set of two black keys as a pair of chop­
sticks. Think of any set of three black keys as the tines on a fork. (Take a 
glance at Figure 5-2.) “Chopsticks” starts with the letter C, and “fork” starts

with the letter F. This handy memory-device forms the basis of the E-Z Key 
Finder technique for finding the white keys on the keyboard. The main points 
are as follows:
	
✓	To the left of the chopsticks (two black keys) is the note C.
	
✓	To the left of the fork (three black keys) is the note F.
	
Figure 5-2: 
Chopsticks 
and forks 
on your 
keyboard.
	
Allow that to sink in while you look at your keyboard, and you won’t forget it. 
But what about the other white keys, you ask? You know the alphabet fairly 
well, don’t you? Look at the alphabet letters again: A-B-C-D-E-F-G.
Notice what letters surround C and what letters surround F. The same advanced 
logic applies to the white keys surrounding C and F. Moving up from C you 
have the notes D, E, F, G. When you get to G, think “Go” as in “go back to the 
beginning of the alphabet.” The alphabet pattern repeats over and over again 
on the keyboard, as many times as you see chopsticks and forks.
	
To practice finding notes, play every C and F on the keyboard, from bottom to 
top. Then locate every D and G. Test yourself by playing all the other white 
keys while reciting the names of the keys. With the aid of the E-Z Key Finder, 
you’ll never forget a key’s name.
Now that you know the names of the white keys, you can play:
	
✓	The first nine notes of “Over the River and Through the Woods”: D, D, D, 
D, B, C, D, D, D.
	
✓	The first six notes of “It’s Raining, It’s Pouring”: B, D, B, E, D, B.
	
✓	The first seven notes of “The First Noel”: E, D, C, D, E, F, G.
	
✓	The first eleven notes to the theme from Ravel’s Boléro: C, B, C, D, C, B, 
A, C, C, A, C.

84
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
The black keys — sharps and flats
Play A, then B, then the black key in between A and B. You’ll notice that it 
sounds like a different musical note. You’re correct: Black keys represent 
separate musical notes from white keys. However, because no alphabet letter 
comes between the letters A and B, the black key between these two can’t be 
given a logical alphabet name.
The black keys are assigned the same name as the closest white key but with 
one of the following suffixes added on:
	
✓	Sharp is used for a black key to the right of (or higher than) a white key.
	
✓	Flat is used for a black key to the left of (or lower than) a white key.
	
Here’s another culinary metaphor to help you remember these suffixes. At 
your imaginary musical place setting, a white key represents a plate. Now 
imagine that
	
✓	A knife is sharp and lies on the right side of the plate.
	
✓	A napkin is flat and lies on the left side of the plate.
Put it to the test: Find the D plate (key). To the right is a sharp knife, D sharp. 
To the left is a flat napkin, D flat. Easy enough? Just remember chopsticks and 
forks, knives and napkins, and you’ll never forget the names of the keys.
Because each of the black keys lies between two white keys, each black key has 
two names, depending on the white key you approach it from. For example, the 
black key to the right of C is C sharp, but it’s also D flat. The split personality 
of each black key (note) seems odd at first, but after you get the hang of seeing 
each key from two different perspectives, it isn’t that awkward.
	
You probably already noticed that no black keys reside between B and C or E 
and F. Before you demand a full refund from your local keyboard dealer, you 
should know that this is no mistake. Theoretically, C is also B sharp and, simi­
larly, E is also F flat. But this is way too much needless music theory. Suffice it 
to say that there are no notes between B and C or E and F. You’ll survive for 
now without knowing why.
	
Develop a clear mental image of the octave groupings on the keyboard, and 
then check your mental image against Figure 5-3. These groupings will help 
you navigate the 88s.

What Your Parents Never 
Told You About Posture
Good posture, including how you sit and how you hold your hands, keeps you 
comfortable at your keyboard for hours on end. Practicing good posture while 
you play also helps you avoid cramped hands, a tired back, and even more 
serious medical problems like carpal tunnel syndrome. After you’re a famous 
concert pianist, you can look back fondly on this chapter and remember how 
it helped prepare you for a career with the keyboard.
To sit or not to sit
Depending on the type of keyboard — and sometimes the type of stage — that 
you’re playing on, you can either sit or stand while you play.
As a general rule, most pianists sit at the piano, but many rock keyboardists 
stand behind their boards. Maybe they want the audience to have a better 
view of them playing. Or maybe they don’t want to appear shorter than the 
guitarist and bass player.

86
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
	
It’s probably a good idea to begin your musical endeavors in a seated position. 
No matter what kind of keyboard you play, sitting brings you closer to the 
keys and makes you more comfortable as you practice.
Whether sitting or standing, you should be comfortable at all times. Your feet 
should rest firmly on the floor. Your hands should have a nice relaxed arch 
to them. The keys should be at an appropriate height so that your hands and 
forearms are parallel to the ground, as shown in Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-4: 
Proper 
posture and 
positioning 
at the piano.
	
Make sure your back is straight and that you aren’t slumping, slouching, or 
hunching over. Not sitting up straight leads to backaches — the kind that 
­discourage you from practicing.
Chairs versus benches
Both chairs and benches are acceptable options, and both are readily available 
at most piano stores and concert halls. Of course, both options have their pros 
and cons, and it’s up to you to sort out what’s the best fit for your playing.

87
 Chapter 5: Getting Comfy at the Keyboard
Book I
Piano & 
Keyboard 
101
Chairs
Your seat shouldn’t be a recliner with flip-out footrest and side pockets for 
the TV remote. Piano chairs are usually plain, black chairs. Many have a 
padded seat, and some offer a useful mechanism to raise or lower the height 
just a bit, as shown in Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-5: 
An adjust-
able piano 
chair.
	
The back on a chair provides some added support, but it also may cause you to 
slump more just because you can. As Mom and Dad always told you, slumping 
isn’t attractive or good for your back. Also, the extra wood on chair backs often 
tends to creak, which isn’t a pleasant sound during a performance of Debussy’s 
Clair de Lune.
But paradoxically, the back on a chair is also its main advantage. The extra 
support is good for young, sometimes fidgety students because they feel 
more secure on a chair than on a backless bench. Heck, you can even strap 
on a booster seat for the young child prodigy. Plus, like it or not, everyone 
slumps occasionally. If you practice diligently into the wee hours of the night, 
at least you’re practicing!

88
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
Maybe the biggest drawback of a chair is the inability to accommodate a duet 
partner. Many pianists enjoy playing duets with friends. You sit side-by-side 
and play the keyboard in two parts: one person playing the lower notes, and 
the other playing the upper notes. Sure, you can just pull up another chair, 
but where’s the romance in that?
Benches
The standard piano bench, shown Figure 5-6a, measures approximately 2 feet 
high by 3 feet wide. The width allows ample room for shifting yourself to reach 
higher or lower notes while you play, and it also accommodates a duet partner.
Height is an important function of whatever you choose to sit on while playing. 
However, many piano benches aren’t adjustable, forcing you to lean up into the 
keyboard or to sit atop a stack of phone books. The nicer benches come with 
knobs on the side that let you adjust the bench height for a more personal fit 
(shown in Figure 5-6b). The better benches also offer padding, which you begin 
to appreciate after a few hours of hard practice.

piano bench:

(a) and 
­standard (b).

Unlike a chair, a bench provides no back support, leaving you to keep a 
straight spine throughout the performance. On the plus side, a backless 
bench forces good posture during your playing. However, no back support 
also means no protection from falling backwards when you become too 
excited during the climax of a Bartók concerto or your jamming rock solo.
Some piano benches have hinged seats, allowing you to open the seat and 
store sheet music, books, or even a mid-concert snack. Just don’t forget what 
you leave in there.
Stands and racks
Keyboard stands (see Figure 5-7) come in all shapes and sizes. Some are 
multi-tiered for adding more and more keyboards as your career or bank 
account grows. Keyboard stands also come in different colors. (If you don’t 
like the colors, you can always buy a can of spray paint.)
	
Figure 5-7:

electric 
keyboard.
	

90
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
Nearly every stand is adjustable because the manufacturer is never exactly 
sure just how tall its client base is. You can adjust the height of the keyboard 
so that you can sit or stand, depending on your mood. Just make sure that 
the keys are at the proper height (refer to Figure 5-4). The adjustability also 
allows you to spread multiple keyboards farther apart on the stand to allow 
easy access to the various buttons and knobs on each.
In addition to a stand, you may also need an effects rack, which is a wooden or 
metal box with holed brackets along the edge into which you can screw various 
components, samplers, effects processors, mixers, or even drawers. Racks can 
be stationary or on rollers, according to your personal needs and desires.
As always, make sure you have adequate lighting for your keyboard, music 
rack, and program/patch display.
It’s All in the Hands
Comfortable hand position and comfortable posture while playing the piano 
or keyboard are of paramount importance. Poor hand position can cause 
your performance to suffer for two reasons:
	
✓	Lack of dexterity: If your hands are in tight, awkward positions, you 
can’t access the keys quickly and efficiently. Your performance will 
sound clumsy and be full of wrong notes.
	
✓	Potential for cramping: If your hands cramp often, you won’t practice 
often. If you don’t practice often, you won’t be a very good player.
Arch those hands and fingers
When you place your hands on the keys, you must keep your hands arched 
and your fingers slightly curled at all times. It feels weird at first, but you can’t 
improve your playing technique until you get used to holding your hands this 
way. Arching your hands and fingers pays off with the following benefits:
	
✓	Your hands don’t get tired as quickly.
	
✓	Your hands are less likely to cramp.
	
✓	You can quickly and easily access any key, black or white.
To get an idea of the hand shape you’re after, find two tennis balls (or similarly 
sized balls) and hold one in each hand, as shown in Figure 5-8. This is how 
your hand should look when you play the piano . . . minus the ball, of course.

Fingering
Fingering refers to using the best finger to play each note of a song, and ­correct 
fingering is always a very important part of piano playing. Some pieces, even 
the easy ones, have fingerings marked in the sheet music to help you plan 
which fingers to use to execute a particular musical passage most efficiently 
and comfortably. Somebody did the work of figuring that out for you, and you 
may as well take advantage of it.
The fingerings you see in music correspond to the left- and right-hand fingering 
you see in Figure 5-9. Number your fingers 1 through 5, beginning with the thumb 
as number 1 and moving toward the little finger, or pinkie.
	
Figure 5-9: 
Numbers 
and digits.
	
	
While you get used to thinking of your fingers in terms of numbers, you may 
find it helpful to write these numbers on your hands before you sit down to 
practice. Use a washable marker or pen. Otherwise, you’ll have to explain 
those numbered fingers to your date on Friday night, your boss on Monday 
morning, or your homeroom teacher.

92
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
When to give your hands 
and fingers a rest
Poor posture can lead to the beginning of serious and painful problems in 
your piano career. The sports claim “no pain, no gain” has no validity when 
applied to piano playing. Muscle tension and poor posture can cause pain. If 
you hurt, you won’t play. If you don’t play, you won’t be very good.
Feeling cramped
Even if your posture is absolutely perfect, your hands will inevitably begin to 
cramp at some point. Cramps are your body’s way of saying, “Hey, let’s go do 
something else for a while.” By all means, listen to your body.
Generally, you’ll experience hand cramps long before you experience any 
other kind of body cramp during practice. Your back and neck may become 
sore from poor posture, but your hands will begin to cramp simply from too 
much use.
	
If your hands hurt, take a long break and do something that creates a com­
pletely opposite hand action. For example, throwing a ball to your dog is an 
opposite hand action; typing is not. If your whole body hurts, get a massage 
(including a hand massage) or take a luxurious cruise in the South Pacific. 
You deserve it.
Avoiding carpal tunnel syndrome
Much has been said about a career-oriented injury called carpal tunnel syn­
drome (CTS). CTS develops from overstraining the muscles and ligaments in 
your wrist through constant, repetitive action. And piano or keyboard playing 
is a constant, repetitive action.
	
As you can probably imagine, many a keyboardist and full-time blogger experi­
ence CTS during their careers. Unfortunately, many wait until it’s too late for a 
simple remedy. They ignore what starts out as a dull pain in the forearms, 
wrists, and fingers until it becomes a severe pain whenever the hands are in 
motion. Severe CTS requires surgery to remedy, but the results aren’t always 
100 percent. As a piano player, you need 100 percent of your hand motion, so 
don’t let any pain go unnoticed.
	
If you’re bothered by pain in your wrists, no matter how minor, consult your 
physician for ways to reduce or prevent it. Of course, if you’ve already been 
diagnosed with CTS, talk with your physician about your piano-playing goals 
and ask what steps you can take to prevent any further damage or pain. (Your 
doctor will probably ask how you got interested in the piano, giving you an 
excellent opportunity to wholeheartedly endorse this book.)

Pedal Power: Getting Your 
Feet in on the Action
When you play the keyboard, your hands are busy on the keys, and your feet 
are called upon to work the pedals to control other aspects of the music.
Most pianos have two or three pedals, and synthesizers can have even more. 
Pipe organs often incorporate an entire keyboard of pedals to be played by the 
feet. This book doesn’t go into the details of pipe organ pedals, but if you play 
a pipe organ, you can find a whole host of teachers at your disposal to help you 
figure out the pedals (see Book I Chapter 2 for a little more on pipe organs).
The various pedals on your instrument allow you to achieve different effects 
in your music. Most of the time, the composer indicates when to use which 
pedal, but you should feel free to experiment with the pedals and the inter­
pretations they can bring to your music.
Piano pedals
Most pianos come equipped with three pedals, shown in Figure 5-10.
	
Figure 5-10: 
The typical 
three pedals 
on a piano.
	
	
✓	To the far right is the damper pedal (or sustain pedal). When you hold 
this pedal down, the dampers — mechanisms that mute the strings — are 
moved away from the strings, allowing the strings to ring until you release 
the pedal, the sound gradually fades away, or you fall asleep and fall off 

94
Book I: Piano & Keyboard 101 
the bench. You don’t have to use the damper pedal every time you play a 
note because each key has its own damper. (For more on dampers, turn 
to Book I Chapter 2.)
	
	Most musicians, and even nonmusicians who purport to know something 
about music, refer to the damper pedal as “the pedal” because it’s the 
most popular and most frequently used pedal.
	
✓	To the far left is the soft pedal. This pedal works differently in uprights 
and grands, but you use it to make your piano sound softer.
	
	The Italian name for the soft pedal is the una corda. On grand pianos, 
pressing down this pedal causes the entire set of hammers inside the 
piano to shift slightly to the side. When you play on any of the keys with 
the pedal down, the hammers hit only one string, or una corda, instead 
of the usual three.
	
✓	In the middle is the middle pedal, or sostenuto pedal. This pedal 
appears on many pianos, but not all. Unlike the damper pedal, which 
sustains all notes being played, the middle pedal allows you to sustain a 
specific note, or group of notes, while you continue playing other notes 
normally. Simultaneously hold down the middle pedal and play a key 
on the piano and the sound sustains. Now, quickly play other notes and 
you’ll notice they don’t sustain. Pretty cool, right? Well, pretty difficult, 
too — especially in the midst of playing Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto 
No. 3. Many piano manufacturers now opt to save money and omit this 
pedal.
	
	On some upright pianos, the middle pedal is called a practice pedal and 
has an entirely different function: It inserts a layer of felt between the 
hammers and strings to make the sound much softer and more muffled. 
This pedal allows you to practice late at night without disturbing others, 
so you might call it the good neighbor pedal.
Digital keyboard pedals
The most common digital keyboard pedals are the sustain pedal (which per­
forms the same function as on an acoustic piano, explained in the ­previous 
­section) and the volume pedal (which increases or decreases the volume). Nearly 
every keyboard comes with a plug-in sustain pedal; it doesn’t move any ­dampers 
or shift any keys because there are no real strings inside a digital keyboard. 
Instead, the pedal sends an electronic signal to the brain of your keyboard, 
­telling it to sustain the notes or increase or decrease the volume if you’re using 
a volume pedal.

95
 Chapter 5: Getting Comfy at the Keyboard
Book I
Piano & 
Keyboard 
101
Other pedals you can add to your electric keyboard control such things as 
vibrato, which makes the note sound as if it’s warbling; program changes; and 
special effects.
You can sample these various pedals and decide which ones are right for you 
at your local electric keyboard dealer. The salesperson should be more than 
happy to show you a whole line of different pedals, hoping that you want to 
spend even more money than you already are for the keyboard itself. If you’re 
unsure about extra pedals, hold off on buying them. You can always buy and 
install them later, when you know that you’ll use them. The plug for all pedals 
and most other accessories is a standard size, making additions a snap.

Looking at Notes and Beats
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding rhythm, beat, and tempo
▶	Reviewing notes and note values
▶	Counting (and clapping) out different notes and note values
J

ust about everyone has taken some sort of music lessons, either formal paid 
lessons from a local piano teacher or at the very least the ­state-mandated 
rudimentary music classes offered in public school. Either way, you’ve been 
asked at some point to knock out a beat, if only by clapping your hands.
Maybe the music lesson seemed pretty pointless at the time or served only 
as a great excuse to bop your grade-school neighbor on the head. However, 
counting out a beat is exactly where you have to start with music. Without a 
discernible beat, you have nothing to dance or nod your head to. Although 
all the other parts of music (pitch, melody, harmony, and so on) are pretty 
darned important, without beat, you don’t really have a song.
	
Everything around you has a rhythm to it, including you. In music, the rhythm is 
the pattern of regular or irregular pulses. The most basic thing you’re striving to 
find in songs is the rhythm. Luckily, written music makes it easy to interpret 
other composers’ works and produce the kind of rhythm they had in mind for 
their songs.
The first half of this chapter provides you with a solid introduction to the 
basics of counting notes and discovering a song’s rhythm, beat, and tempo.
Note: The common U.S. name is quarter note, but in the U.K. they call it 
a crotchet. The U.K. names are also used in medieval music and in some 
­classical circles. This book uses the U.S. common names for the notes, which 
are more universally standard.

100
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
The second half of this chapter shows you just how important the timing of 
your notes is when playing the piano. As they say, timing is everything, and 
every note in music has a starting point and an ending point. So notes need 
to have different values that can be counted. You’ll also see how time in 
music can be measured in other ways: by measuring the rate of the beat to 
determine the tempo of a song, and by using a time signature to determine 
the beat pattern of a song.
You’ll earn your place in the rhythm nation as you get to know the timely trio — 
note values, tempo indications, and time signatures — that creates rhythm. This 
chapter introduces you to these rhythm elements and gives you some practice 
tunes to play on your keyboard.
Meeting the Beat
A beat is a pulsation that divides time into equal lengths. A ticking clock is a 
good example. Every minute, the second hand ticks 60 times, and each one of 
those ticks is a beat. If you speed up or slow down the second hand, you’re 
changing the tempo of the beat. Notes in music tell you what to play during 
each of those ticks. In other words, the notes tell you how long and how 
often to play a certain musical pitch — the low or high sound a specific note 
makes — within the beat.
When you think of the word note as associated with music, you may think of a 
sound. However, in music, one of the main uses for notes is to explain exactly 
how long a specific pitch should be held by the voice or an instrument. The 
note value, indicated by the size and shape of the note, determines this 
length. Together with the preceding three features, the note value determines 
what kind of rhythm the resulting piece of music will have. It determines 
whether the song will run along very quickly and cheerfully, will crawl along 
slowly and somberly, or will progress in some other way.
When figuring out how to follow the beat, rhythm sticks (fat, cylindrical, hard 
wood instruments) come in real handy. So do drum sticks. If you’ve got a pair, 
grab ’em. If you don’t, clapping or smacking your hand against bongos or 
your desktop works just as well.
	
Eventually “hearing” a beat in your head (or “feeling” a beat in your body) is 
absolutely fundamental while you play music, whether you’re reading a piece 
of sheet music or jamming with other musicians. The only way you can master 
this basic task is practice, practice, practice. Following along with the beat is 
something you need to pick up if you want progress in music.

101
 Chapter 1: Looking at Notes and Beats
Book II
Understanding 
Theory and  
the Language 
of Music
	
Perhaps the easiest way to practice working with a steady beat is to buy a metro­
nome. They’re pretty cheap, and even a crummy one should last you for years. 
The beauty of a metronome is that you can set it to a wide range of tempos, from 
very, very slow to hummingbird fast. If you’re using a metronome to practice — 
especially if you’re reading from a piece of sheet music — you can set the beat to 
whatever speed you’re comfortable with and gradually speed it up to the com­
poser’s intended speed when you’ve figured out the pacing of the song. You can 
also find metronome apps for your smartphone, which work just as well.
Recognizing Notes and Note Values
If you think of music as a language, then notes are like letters of the ­alphabet — 
they’re that basic to the construction of a piece of music. Studying how note 
values fit against each other in a piece of sheet music is as important as knowing 
musical pitches because if you change the note values, you end up with com­
pletely different music. In fact, when musicians talk about performing a piece of 
music “in the style of” Bach, Beethoven, or Philip Glass, they’re talking as much 
about using the rhythm structure and pace characteristics of that particular 
composer’s music as much as any particular chord progressions or melodic 
choices.
Examining the notes and their components
Notes are made of up to three specific components: note head, stem, and flag.
	
✓	Head: The head is the round part of a note. Every note has one. A whole 
note is just a head: 𝅝.
	
✓	Stem: The stem is the vertical line attached to the note head. Eighth 
notes, quarter notes, and half notes all have stems. Here is a half note: 𝅗𝅥.
	
✓	Flag: The flag is the little line that comes off the top or bottom of the 
note stem. Eighth notes and shorter notes have flags: ♪.
	
Stems can point either up or down, depending where on the staff they appear 
(you find out all about staves in Book II Chapters 3 and 4). Whether the stem 
points up or down makes no difference in the value of the note.
Instead of each note getting a flag, notes with flags can also be connected 
to each other with a beam, which is just a cleaner-looking incarnation of the 
flag. For example, Figure 1-1 shows how two eighth notes can be written as 
each having a flag or as connected by a beam.

102

Figure 1-1: 
Eighth notes 
can have 
individual 
flags or 
­connect 
with a beam.	
Figure 1-2 shows four sixteenth notes with flags grouped three separate ways: 
individually, in two pairs connected by a double beam, and all connected by 
one double beam. It doesn’t matter which way you write them; they sound 
the same when played.
	
Figure 1-2:

notes,

­different 
ways, all 
sound alike.	
Likewise, you can write eight thirty-second notes in either of the ways shown 
in Figure 1-3. Notice that these notes get three flags (or three beams). Using 
beams instead of individual flags on notes is simply a case of trying to clean 
up an otherwise messy-looking piece of musical notation. Beams help ­musical 
performers by allowing them to see where the larger beats are. Instead of 
seeing sixteen disconnected sixteenth notes, it’s helpful for a performer to 
see four groups of four sixteenths connected by a beam.

Looking at note values
As you may remember from school or music lessons, each note has its own 
note value. Before we go into detail on each kind of note, have a look at 
Figure 1-4, which shows most of the kinds of notes you’ll encounter in music 
arranged so their values add up the same in each row. At the top is the whole 
note, below that half notes, then quarter notes, eighth notes, and finally 
sixteenth notes on the bottom. Each level of the “tree of notes” is equal to the 
others. The value of a half note, for example, is half of a whole note, and the 
value of a quarter note is a quarter of a whole note.
	
Another way to think of notes is to imagine a whole note as a pie, which is easy 
because it’s round. To divvy up the pie into quarter notes, cut it in ­quarters. 
Cutting the pie into eight pieces gives you eighth notes, and so on.
Depending on the time signature of the piece of music (see Chapter 4), the note 
value that’s equal to one beat changes. In the most common time ­signature, 4/4 
time, also called common time, a whole note is held for four beats, a half note is 
held for two, and a quarter note lasts one beat. An eighth note lasts half a beat, 
and a sixteenth note lasts just a quarter of a beat in 4/4 time.
	
Figure 1-4: 
Each level 
of this tree 
of notes 
lasts as 
many beats 
as every 
other level.
	
	
Often, the quarter note equals one beat. If you sing, “MA-RY HAD A LIT-TLE 
LA-MB,” each syllable is one beat (you can clap along with it), and each beat gets 
one quarter note if the song is notated in 4/4 time. We talk more about time sig­
natures and counting beats accordingly in Chapter 4.
Whole notes
The whole note lasts the longest of all the notes. It looks like this: 𝅝.
In 4/4 time, a whole note lasts for an entire four beats (see Book II Chapter 4 for 
more on time signatures). For four whole beats you don’t have to do anything 
with that one note except play and hold it. That’s it.

104
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
Usually, when you count note values, you clap or tap on the note and say 
aloud the remaining beats. You count the beats of whole notes like this:
CLAP two three four CLAP two three four CLAP two three four
“CLAP” means you clap your hands, and “two three four” is what you say out 
loud as the note is held for four beats. When you see three whole notes in a 
row, for example, each one gets its own “four-count.”
Half notes
It’s simple logic what comes after whole notes in value — a half note, of 
course. You hold a half note for half as long as you would a whole note. 
Half notes look like this: 𝅗𝅥. When you count out three half notes, it sounds 
like this:
CLAP two CLAP two CLAP two
	
Because the highest-valued note in that sequence is a half note, you only 
count up to the number two.
You could have a whole note followed by two half notes. In that case, you 
count out the three notes as follows:
CLAP two three four CLAP two CLAP two
Quarter notes
Divide a whole note, which is worth four beats, by four, and you get a quarter 
note with a note value of one beat. Quarter notes look like half notes except 
that the note head is completely filled in: ♩. Four quarter notes are counted 
out like this:
CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP
The laws of stem gravity
You may have noticed that sometimes a note’s 
stem points up and sometimes it points down. 
Thanks to the laws of stem gravity, any notes 
on or above the middle line of a staff point 
downwards. This applies to all notes with 
stems. Also notice that up-stems start to the 
right side of a notehead, and down-stems start 
to the left of the notehead.

105
 Chapter 1: Looking at Notes and Beats
Book II
Understanding 
Theory and  
the Language 
of Music
	
Because the highest-valued note there is a quarter note, you count up to one. 
Four quarter notes together last as long as one whole note.
Suppose you replace one of the quarter notes with a whole note and one with 
a half note, as shown in Figure 1-5.
	
Figure 1-5: 
A mix of 
whole, half, 
and quarter 
notes.
	
In that case, you count out the notes like this:
CLAP two three four CLAP CLAP CLAP two
Eighth notes and beyond
When sheet music includes eighth notes and beyond, it starts to look a little 
intimidating. Usually, just one or two clusters of eighth notes in a piece of 
musical notation isn’t enough to frighten the average beginning student, but 
when that same student opens to a page that’s littered with eighth notes, 
sixteenth notes, or thirty-second notes, she just knows she has some work 
ahead of her. Why? Because usually these notes are fast.
An eighth note — ♪ — has a value of half of a quarter note. Eight eighth notes 
last as long as one whole note, which means an eighth note lasts half a beat 
(in 4/4, or common, time). You hold an eighth note for one-eighth as long as a 
whole note.
How can you have half a beat? Easy. Tap your toe for the beat and clap your 
hands twice for every toe tap.
CLAP-CLAP CLAP-CLAP CLAP-CLAP CLAP-CLAP
Or you can count it out as follows:
ONE-and TWO-and THREE-and FOUR-and
The numbers represent four beats, and the “ands” are the half beats.

106
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
Just think of each tick of a metronome as an eighth note instead of a quarter 
note. That means a quarter note is now two ticks, a half note is four ticks, and 
a whole note lasts eight ticks.
Similarly, if you have a piece of sheet music with sixteenth notes, each ­sixteenth 
note can equal one metronome tick, an eighth note two ticks, a quarter note four 
ticks, a half note eight ticks, and a whole note can equal sixteen ticks.
A sixteenth note has a note value of one quarter of a quarter note, which 
means it lasts one-sixteenth as long as a whole note. A sixteenth note looks 
like this: 𝅘𝅥𝅯.
If you have a piece of sheet music with thirty-second notes, which have, as 
you may have guessed, three flags or beams, remember that a thirty-second 
note equals one metronome tick, a sixteenth note equals two, an eighth note 
equals four, a quarter note equals eight, a half note equals sixteen, and a 
whole note equals thirty-two ticks.
You’ll be glad to hear that you won’t run into thirty-second notes very often.
Extending Notes with Dots and Ties
Sometimes you want to add to the value of a note. You have two main ways 
to extend a note’s value in written music: dots and ties.
Using dots to increase a note’s value
Occasionally, you’ll come across a note followed by a small dot, called an 
augmentation dot. This dot indicates that the note’s value is increased by one 
half of its original value. The most common use of the dotted note is when a 
half note is made to last three quarter note beats instead of two, as shown in 
Figure 1-6. Another way to think about dots is that they make a note equal to 
three of the next shorter value instead of two.
	
Figure 1-6: 
 A dotted 
half note.
	
You may also see a dotted whole note. That means the whole note’s value is 
increased from four beats to six beats.

107
 Chapter 1: Looking at Notes and Beats
Book II
Understanding 
Theory and  
the Language 
of Music
Adding notes together with ties
Another way to increase the value of a note is by tying it to another note, as 
Figure 1-7 shows. Ties connect notes of the same pitch together to create one 
sustained note instead of two separate ones. When you see a tie, simply add 
the notes together. For example, a quarter note tied to another quarter note 
equals one note held for two beats:
CLAP-two!
	
Figure 1-7: 
Two tied 
quarter 
notes equal 
a half note.	
	
Don’t confuse ties with slurs. A slur looks kind of like a tie, except that it con­
nects two notes of different pitches.
Mixing All the Note Values Together
You won’t encounter many pieces of music that are composed entirely of one 
kind of note, so you need to practice working with a variety of note values.
The four exercises shown in Figures 1-8 through 1-11 can help make a beat 
stick in your head and make each kind of note automatically register its value 
in your brain. Each exercise contains five groups (or measures) of four beats 
each. The measures are notated with vertical lines, called bar lines.
In these exercises, you clap on the CLAPs and say the numbers aloud. Where 
you see a hyphenated CLAP-CLAP, do two claps per beat (in other words, two 
claps in the space of one normal clap).
	
Start out counting and then dive in after you count four.

S

ometimes the most important aspects of a conversation are the things 
that aren’t said. Likewise, many times the notes you don’t play make all 
the difference in a piece of music.
These silent “notes” are called, quite fittingly, rests. When you see a rest 
in a piece of music, you don’t have to do anything but continue counting 
out the beats during it. Rests are especially important when writing down 
your music for other people to read — and in reading other composers’ 
music — because rests make the rhythm of that piece of music even more 
precise than musical notes alone would.
Rests work particularly well with music for multiple instruments. Rests make 
it easy for a performer to count out the beats and keep time with the rest of 
the ensemble, even if the performer’s instrument doesn’t come into play until 
later in the performance. Likewise, in piano music, rests tell the left or right 
hand — or both — to stop playing in a piece.
	
Don’t let the name fool you. A rest in a piece of music is anything but nap-
time. If you don’t continue to steadily count through the rests, just as you do 
when you’re playing notes, your timing will be off and eventually the piece 
will fall apart.
Getting to Know the Rests
You might think of rests as the spaces between words in a written sentence. 
If those spaces weren’t there, you’d just be stringing one long word together 
into gobbledygook.

110
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
	
Musical rests don’t get claps (or notes from pianos or keyboards). You just count 
them out in your head. Just remember to stop playing while you’re counting.
Figure 2-1 shows you the note values you know from Book II Chapter 1 and 
their matching rests.
	
Figure 2-1: 
Notes and 
their equiva-
lent rests.
	
Figure 2-2 shows the relative values of rests, ranging from a whole rest at the 
top to the sixteenth rests at the bottom. At the top is the whole rest, below it 
half rests, then quarter rests, eighth rests, and sixteenth rests. This section 
discusses each of these rests.
	
Figure 2-2: 
Each level 
of this tree 
of rests

as every

Whole and half rests
When you see a whole note F, you play F and hold it for four beats. For a half 
note, you play and hold the note for two beats. So far, so good. Now, a whole 
rest (
) asks you to not play anything for four beats. And a half rest (
) asks 
you to not play anything for two beats.

111
 Chapter 2: Stopping for a Rest
Book II

Whole and half rests look like little hats — one hat off (
 = whole rest) and 
one hat on (
 = half rest). This hat analogy and the rules of etiquette make 
for a good way to remember these rests. Check it out:
	
✓	If you rest for the entire measure (four beats), take off your hat and stay 
for a while.
	
✓	If you rest for only half of the measure (two beats), the hat stays on.
These rests always look the same, making it easy for you to spot them in the 
music. A whole rest hangs from the fourth line up, and a half rest sits on the 
middle line, as shown in Figure 2-3.
	
Figure 2-3: 
Whole and 
half rests on 
the staff.
	
To see whole and half rests in action, take a peek at Figure 2-4. In the first 
measure, you play the two A quarter notes (use your 3rd finger) on beats 1 
and 2, and then the half rest tells you not to play anything for beats 3 and 4. 
In the second measure, the whole rest tells you that you’re off duty — you 
rest for four beats. In the third measure, you put down your donut and play 
two G quarter notes (2nd finger) and rest for two beats of rest. Finally, the 
whole show ends in the fourth measure with a whole note A.
	
Figure 2-4: 
Practice 
your whole 
and half 
rests.
	
Quarter and eighth rests and beyond
Composers also use rests to tell you to stop playing for the equivalent of 
quarter notes and eighth notes.

112
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
I like to think of the quarter rest as an uncomfortable-looking chair. Have a 
look and see what you think: 𝄽. Because it’s uncomfortable, you don’t rest too 
long. In fact, you don’t rest any longer than one beat in this chair.
The eighth rest — 𝄾 — and sixteenth rest — 𝄿 — are easy to recognize. They 
have the same number of flags as their note counterparts. An eighth note (𝅘𝅥𝅮) 
and eighth rest (𝄾 ) each has one flag, and a sixteenth note (𝅘𝅥𝅯) and sixteenth 
rest (𝄿) each has two flags.
	
Count all rests just like you count their kindred notes. Quarter rests are easy 
to count because they last only one beat. Eighth and sixteenth rests can be a 
bit harder to count simply because they happen faster. Don’t be afraid to 
count out loud; doing so helps you place the eighth rests more precisely and 
may even cause others to sing along.
Figure 2-5 gives you a chance to count out some quarter and eighth rests. Try 
clapping the rhythms first, and then play them on your piano or keyboard 
using the suggested fingering above each note.
	
Figure 2-5: 
Counting 
quarter and 
eighth rests.
	
	
You’ll read sixteenth note rests when you get into more advanced music. Until 
then, just remember what they look like (refer to Figure 2-1).
	
Using a metronome to count out notes and rests may help you figure out a 
piece of music. You can assign the ticks of the metronome to be any portion of 
the beat that you want. Having a quarter note equal one beat may seem natu­
ral much of the time, but instead of trying to think about half beats, you can 
also assign an eighth note to equal one tick. Then a quarter note would equal 
two ticks, a half note four, and a whole note eight ticks. The relation among the 
different notes and rests always stays the same no matter how many metro­
nome ticks in a whole note.

Dotted rests
Unlike notes, rests are never tied together to make them longer. Rests are, 
however, sometimes dotted when the value of the rest needs to be extended. 
Just as with notes, when you see a rest followed by an augmentation dot, the 
rest’s value is increased by one half of its original value.
Practicing Beats with Notes and Rests
The best way to really hear the way rests affect a piece of music is to mix 
them up with notes. The five exercises shown in Figures 2-6 through 2-10 
are exactly what you need to practice making a beat stick in your head and 
making each kind of note and rest automatically register its value in your 
brain. Each exercise contains three groups of four beats each (and for the 
notes, only quarter notes, so your brain doesn’t explode).
	
In these exercises, with four beats in every measure (4/4 time), you clap on 
the notes and count the rests aloud. Start out counting and then dive in after 
you count four.

s you now know, the beat is what you tap your foot to; it’s the steady 
pulse that provides the groovy groove of the music. A fast-paced dance 
song can get you pumping on the dance floor with a faster beat, and a slow 
love song can make you want to sway slowly to and fro with your honey in 
your arms. One of the first things to do when you play music is find out what 
the tempo is. How fast does the beat go?
Playing Fast and Slow: Tempo
Like heartbeats, musical beats are measured in beats per minute. A certain 
number of beats occur in music (and in your heart) every minute. When a 
doctor tells you how fast your heart is beating, you can think, “Who cares?” 
But when a composer or sheet music tells you how many musical beats occur 
in a specific length of musical time, you can’t take such a whimsical attitude — 
not if you want the music to sound right.
Look at a clock or your watch and tap your foot once every second. You’re 
tapping beats — one beat per second. Of course, beats can be faster or 
slower. Now tap your foot two times for every second.

116
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
How fast or how slow you tap these beats is called tempo. For example, when 
you tap one beat for every second, the tempo is 60 beats per minute (BPM) 
because there are 60 seconds in one minute. You’re tapping a slow, steady 
tempo. When you tap your foot two times per second, you’re tapping a 
­moderately fast tempo at the rate of 120 BPM.
Composers use a tempo indication and sometimes a metronome marking to 
tell you how fast or slow the beat is. The tempo indication, shown above the 
treble staff at the beginning of the music, is a word or two that describes the 
beat in a simple way: fast, slow, moderately fast, and so on. A metronome 
marking tells you the exact rate of the beat, as measured in beats per minute. 
Table 3-1 lists tempo indications and their general parameters using common 
Italian and English directions.
	
As you learn to read and play music, keep in mind that tempo indications leave 
a good amount of discretion to the performer and can be followed in ways not 
limited to the exact rate of the beat.

Don’t forget to get a metronome or a metronome app. That way you don’t 
have to spend all day wondering how to tap out 84 beats per minute.
Grouping Beats into Measures
Think of a music staff as a time line. (Book II Chapter 4 tells you all about 
the music staff.) In the same way that the face of a clock can be divided into 
minutes and seconds, the music staff can also be divided into smaller units 
of time. These smaller units of time help you count the beat and know where 
you are in the song at all times.

117
 Chapter 3: Tempo, Measures, and Time Signatures
Book II
Understanding 
Theory and 
the Language 
of Music
A short three-minute song may have 200 separate beats or more. To keep 
from getting lost in this myriad of beats, it helps to count the beats as you 
play the piano. But rather than ask you to count up into three-digit numbers 
and attempt to play at the same time, the composer groups the beats into 
nice small batches called measures (or bars).
Each measure has a specific number of beats. Most commonly, a measure has 
four beats. This smaller grouping of four beats is much easier to count: Just 
think “1, 2, 3, 4,” and then begin again with “1” in each subsequent measure.
The composer decides how many beats to put in each measure and then 
marks each measure with a vertical line called a bar line, as shown in 
Figure 3-1 (clap to the rhythm slashes).
	
Figure 3-1: 
Bar lines 
group 
beats into 
measures.
	
Why does it matter how many beats are in each measure? Measures help 
group beats into patterns. These patterns are made up of downbeats and 
upbeats, which are beats that are emphasized or de-emphasized, respec­
tively. The repeating beat pattern determines a song’s time signature, covered 
in the next section.
	
Now that you know how to count, play, and hold the three main note values, 
and what a bar is, try playing the music in Figure 3-2, which has a mix of differ­
ent note lengths. Listen to Track 5 and follow along in the music one time before 
you play. It’s true that the song’s melody doesn’t exactly bring a tear to the eye. 
The same note is used (good old G) throughout to help emphasize the rhythm 
created by combining the three note lengths.
	
A measure and a bar are the same thing. You’ll hear them called by both 
terms.

Counting Out Common Time Signatures
In music, a time signature tells you the meter of the piece you’re playing. Each 
measure of music receives a specified number of beats. Composers decide 
the number of beats per measure early on and convey such information with 
a time signature, or meter.
The two numbers in the time signature tell you how many beats are in each 
measure of music. In math, the fraction for a quarter is 1/4, so 4/4 means four 
quarters. Thus, each measure with a time signature of 4/4 has four quarter 
note beats; each measure with a 3/4 meter has three quarter note beats; and 
each measure of 2/4 time has two quarter note beats.
Figure 3-3 shows you three recognizable tunes that are written in each of these 
three time signatures. Notice how the syllable count and word ­emphasis fit 
the time signature.
	
Please keep in mind that 4/4 meter doesn’t mean that each measure has only 
four quarter notes. It means each measure has only four beats. These beats 
may contain half notes, quarter notes, eighth notes, rests, whatever the com­
poser wants — but all note and rest values must combine to equal the top 
number (or numerator) of the time signature.

Figure 3-3: 
You can 
recognize 
the tunes 
of three 
common 
time 
signatures.
	
Common time: 4/4 meter
The most common meter in music is 4/4. It’s so common that its other name 
is common time and the two numbers in the time signature are often replaced 
by the letter C.
In 4/4, the stacked numbers tell you that each measure contains four quarter 
note beats. So, to count 4/4 meter, each time you tap the beat, you’re tapping 
the equivalent of one quarter note.
	
To hear an example of 4/4 meter, play Track 6, “A Hot Time in the Old Town 
Tonight.” Notice how the beat pattern of 4/4 meter creates an emphasis on 
beats 1 and 3, which are downbeats (although beat 1 has the strongest 
­emphasis). Beats 2 and 4 are upbeats. In many rock, R&B, and hip-hop songs, 
the upbeats are accented — this is commonly known as a backbeat. As you 
listen to the track, tap your foot on 1 and 3 (the downbeats), and clap on 
2 and 4 (the upbeats).
Feel free to check out the sheet music as well, right here. Although you may 
not know the notes of the staff yet (don’t worry — they’re finally explained 
in the next chapter) — it can’t hurt to look at the music as you listen, to get 
a feel for it if nothing else. It’s also fine to simply tap your foot on the down­
beats and clap on the upbeats.

120
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
Waltz time: 3/4 meter
In the second most common meter, 3/4, each measure has three quarter note 
beats. Of course, this still doesn’t mean that only quarter notes exist in this 
meter. You may have one half note and one quarter note, or you may have 
six eighth notes, but either way, the combination equals three quarter 
note beats.
In 3/4 meter, beat 1 of each measure is the downbeat, and beats 2 and 3 are 
the upbeats. It’s quite common, though, to hear accents on the second or 
third beats, like in many country music songs.
	
Another name for 3/4 meter is waltz time because of the down-up-up beat 
­pattern used for waltzing. Listen to Track 7, “The Beautiful Blue Danube.” 
Notice the emphasis on beat 1 of each measure. Tap your foot on the down­
beat, and clap on the upbeats. You could say that 3/4 was probably composer 
Johann “Waltz King” Strauss’s favorite meter.

March time: 2/4 meter
Chop a 4/4 meter in half and you’re left with only two quarter note beats per 
measure. Not to worry, though, because two beats per measure is perfectly 
acceptable. In fact, you’ll find 2/4 meter in most famous marches. The rhythm 
is similar to the rhythm of your feet when you march: “left-right, left-right, 1-2, 
1-2.” You start and stop marching on the downbeat — beat 1.
	
Track 8 is a good example of 2/4 meter. It’s a famous dance by Jacques 
Offenbach called “Can Can.” Feel free to march or “do the Can Can” as you 
listen. (For dancing tips, see www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRgWtRXhzUg.)

6/8 time
If you notice that a time signature of 6/8 doesn’t have a “4” in the bottom 
(denominator) position, you’re no doubt already thinking that it can’t be 
a meter based on quarter notes. If you’re thinking that it might be a meter 
based on eighth notes, you’re right. 6/8 meter is a grouping of six eighth 
notes per measure.

123
 Chapter 3: Tempo, Measures, and Time Signatures
Book II
Understanding 
Theory and 
the Language 
of Music
Like the waltz, beats in 6/8 meter are grouped in threes, but there are two 
groups. 6/8 has an added down-up beat pattern on the first eighth note of 
each group — beats 1 and 4. Showing the emphasis using italics, you count a 
measure of 6/8 with one count for each eighth note beat, as follows: One, two, 
three, four, five, six. Beat 1 is a stronger downbeat than 4, so this beat ­pattern 
can feel like two broader beats (down-up), each with its own down-up-up 
­pattern within.
	
Listen to Track 9 for an example of 6/8 meter. Tap your right foot on beat 1, 
tap your left foot on beat 4, and clap the upbeats (2, 3, 5, 6).
Sorting out the language of rhythm
Using words to describe the rhythmic ­qualities 
of music can get tricky. Time signature and 
tempo are different components that work 
together to create the rhythmic framework for 
music. A song in 4/4 and a different song in 3/4 
can have the same tempo because tempo tells 
you the rate of the underlying beat: fast, slow, or 
exactly at the rate of 120 beats per minute, for 
example. A fast song and a slow song can share 
the same time signature — a fast waltz or a 
slow waltz, for example. The time signature tells 
you how the beats are organized into measures 
and how to count the measures. The rhythm of 
a melody is defined by its unique combination 
of note values and rests. All other accompany­
ing rhythmic elements (the bass line, chords, 
drums, requisite tuba solo) combine with these 
elements and make up the rhythm of a song.

T

o play music, you have to know what note to play and when. A piano 
has 88 keys, each sounding a different musical note. With a bunch of 
lines and dots, a composer tells you which notes to play and how to play 
them — which of the 88 keys to press and how long to play each note. This 
chapter aims to help you understand how all that is written down and con­
veyed in printed music.
This chapter discusses the musical staves and where to find notes on them, 
as well as the concept of intervals. Mastering these concepts allows you to 
both navigate your way through a piece of sheet music and even begin to 
learn how to improvise.
Meeting the Staff, Clefs, and Notes
Notes and rests in music are written on what’s called a musical staff 
(or staves, if you’re talking about more than one). A staff is made of five 
parallel horizontal lines, containing four spaces between them, as shown 
in Figure 4-1.

126
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
	
Figure 4-1: 
The treble 
clef staff 
(left) and the 
bass clef 
staff (right).	
Notes and rests are written on the lines and spaces of the staff. The particular 
musical notes that are meant by each line and space depend on which clef is 
written at the beginning of the staff. You may run across any of the following 
clefs (though the first two are the most common):
	
✓	Treble clef
	
✓	Bass clef
	
✓	C clefs, including alto and tenor
	
Think of each clef as a graph of pitches, or tones, shown as notes plotted over 
time on five lines and four spaces. Each pitch or tone is named after one of 
the first seven letters of the alphabet: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C . . . and it 
keeps on going that way indefinitely, repeating the note names as the pitches 
repeat in octaves. The pitch ascends as you go from A to G, with every eighth 
note — where you return to your starting letter — signifying the beginning of 
a new octave.
The treble clef
The treble clef is for higher-pitched notes. It contains the notes above middle 
C on the piano, which means all the notes you play with your right hand. 
The treble clef is also sometimes called the G clef. Note that the shape of 
the treble clef itself resembles a stylized G. The loop on the treble clef also 
circles the second line on the staff — which is the note G.
The notes are located in the treble clef on lines and spaces, in order of 
ascending pitch, as shown in Figure 4-2.

The notes 
of the 
treble clef.

Book II

The bass clef
On the piano, the bass clef contains lower-pitched notes, the ones below 
middle C, including all the notes you play with your left hand. Another name 
for the bass clef is the F clef. The curly top of the clef partly encircles where 
the F note is on the staff, and it has two dots that surround the F note line. 
(It also looks a bit like a cursive letter F, if you use your imagination.)
The notes on the bass clef are also arranged in ascending order, as shown in 
Figure 4-3.
	
Figure 4-3: 
The notes 
of the bass 
clef.
	
The grand staff and ledger lines
Sooner or later, on either staff, you run out of lines and spaces for your notes. 
Surely the composer wants you to use more of the fabulous 88 keys at your 
disposal, right? Here’s a solution: Because you play piano with both hands 
at the same time, why not show both staves (the plural form of staff  ) on the 
music page? Great idea!
Join both staves together with a brace at the start of the left side and you get 
one grand staff (it’s really called that), as shown in Figure 4-4. This way, you 
can read notes for both hands at the same time.
	
Figure 4-4: 
Isn’t this 
staff grand?
	
Why all the space between the two staves? Note that the bottom line of the 
treble clef staff is E, and the top line of the bass clef staff is A. That space is 
for the notes between those two notes.

128
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
That’s where ledger lines come in. Ledger lines allow you to notate the notes 
above and below each staff. Middle C, for example, can be written below the 
treble staff or above the bass staff by using a small line through the notehead, as 
you can see in Figure 4-5. Either way, it’s the same note on the piano keyboard.
	
Figure 4-5: 
Middle C 
written with 
ledger lines 
for right and 
left hand.
	
	
If middle C is written with a ledger line below the treble staff, you play it with 
your right hand; if it’s written with a ledger line above the bass staff, you play 
it with your left hand.
If you’re more of a visual learner, try thinking of it this way: The notes written 
in the middle of the grand staff, or between the two staves, represent notes in 
the middle of the piano keyboard.
The ledger line represents an imaginary line running above or below the staff, 
extending the five-line staff to six, seven, or more lines. A grand way to notate 
all the notes beyond the range of each staff, wouldn’t you say? You can, of 
course, read notes in the spaces between the ledger lines just like you read 
notes in the spaces between the staff lines.
The notes B and D, surrounding middle C, can also be written by using ledger 
lines. That is, D can either be written below the bottom line of the treble staff, or 
it can sit on top of the middle C ledger line above the bass staff. Similarly, B can 
sit on top of the bass staff or below the middle C ledger line of the treble staff. 
Figure 4-6 illustrates these flexible note positions on the grand staff.

Climbing beyond the staff
Middle C may be powerful, but it isn’t the only note to receive the coveted 
ledger line award. Other ledger lines come into play when you get to notes 
that are above and below the grand staff. Notes written above the treble staff 
represent higher notes, to the right on your keyboard. Conversely, notes writ­
ten below the bass staff represent lower notes, to the left on your keyboard.
For example, the top line of the treble staff is F. Just above this line, sits the 
note G. After G, a whole new set of ledger lines waits to bust out.
A similar situation occurs at the bottom of the bass staff. Ledger lines begin 
popping up below the low G line and low F that’s hanging on to the staff for 
dear life. Figure 4-7 shows a generous range of notes on the grand staff and 
how they relate to the keyboard.
Figure 4-7: 
Notes on 
the grand 
staff.
An octave above, an octave below
Writing and reading ledger lines for notes farther up and down the keyboard 
can get a little ridiculous. After all, if you were to keep using ledger lines, 
you’d take up an impractical amount of space, and reading all those lines 
would become tedious. That’s why composers invented the octave, or ottava 
line, which tells you to play the indicated note or notes an octave higher or 
lower than written. The abbreviation 8va means play an octave above, and 
8vb means play an octave below. Figure 4-8 shows how these octave lines 
appear in written music.

Identifying Half Steps, Whole Steps, 
and Accidentals on the Staff
In Western music, an octave is broken up into 12 tones called half steps, or 
semitones. But a musical scale contains seven notes, meaning that some of the 
distance between notes in a scale spans one half step, and some spans at least 
two half steps. In other words, some half steps are skipped when building 
scales. (Check out Book III Chapter 2 for much more on scales.)
When musicians talk about the notes A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, they mean the 
natural notes — specifically, the notes that correspond to the white keys on 
a keyboard. The white keys of the keyboard were assigned the natural letter 
notes, which turn out to be the notes of the C major scale, beginning with C. 
However, because you’re dealing with a musical vocabulary made up of 12 
half steps (or semitones), the keyboard also has five black keys, repeated 
over and over, which represent the semitones that are skipped in the C scale. 
The black keys were added much later than the original white keys in order 
to help build more perfect musical scales on the piano.
Solving the mysteries that lurk between the clefs
The existence of middle C clears up some very 
big questions about the staves:
	✓	If it’s so important, then why isn’t G on the 
middle line of the treble staff?
	✓	Likewise, why isn’t F on the middle line of 
the bass staff?
The answer to both of these mysteries is, of 
course, that the staff positions of G and F are 
determined by their distance from middle C. 
You might say middle C has some power in 
the musical world.

Moving a whole step on the piano means you move two half steps from your 
starting position. Half steps and whole steps are called intervals. Knowing the 
difference between whole steps and half steps is important when working 
with the patterns used to build scales and chords.
You also employ half steps when you come across an accidental, a notation 
used to raise or lower a natural note pitch. So when a note is sharped, you 
add a half step to the note; when a note is flatted, you remove a half step from 
the note.
Working with half steps
In Western musical notation, the smallest difference between two pitches is 
the half step, or semitone. Using the piano keyboard as a reference, if you 
pick a key, play it, and then play the key that’s right next to it (on the left or 
right) whether that key is black or white, you’ve moved one half step in pitch. 
See Figure 4-9 for an illustration of this principle.
	
Figure 4-9: 
Half steps to 
the left and 
right of the 
E key.
	
	
Because musical pitch is actually a continuous spectrum (think about a trom­
bone sliding up the scale), many other microtonal sounds actually exist 
between consecutive half steps. But Western musical notation only recognizes 
the division of pitch into half steps. In contrast, many Eastern instruments, 
particularly sitars and fretless stringed instruments, use quarter tones. Quarter 
tones are pitches located halfway between each half step.
As you can see in Figure 4-9, if you start out playing an E on the piano, a half 
step to the left brings you to E ♭ (E flat), which could also be called D ♯ (D sharp). 
A half step to the right lands you on E ♯, which is more commonly known as F, 
or F ♮ (F natural).

132
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
	
When a musician refers to a note being flatted, you know you need to move 
one half step to the left of that natural note; if it’s being sharped, you know to 
move one half step to the right. Every black key on a piano has two names: It 
can be referred to as the flat of the white key on its right or the sharp of the 
white key on its left. It doesn’t matter which way it’s named. For example, E 
flat and D sharp may be written as different notes, but they have the same 
pitch, or sound. Notes with the same pitch are referred to as enharmonic.
Taking whole steps
Following the logic that a half step on the piano is one key away from the 
starting point, it only makes sense that a whole step would be two keys or 
frets away from the starting point.
Say, for example, that you start on E on the keyboard. One whole step to the 
left of E would be D, as shown in Figure 4-10.
	
Figure 4-10: 
One whole 
step, or two 
half steps, 
to the left of 
E brings you 
to D.
	
Meanwhile, one whole step to the right of E would be F sharp, as shown in 
Figure 4-11.
	
Figure 4-11: 
One whole 
step, or two 
half steps, 
to the right 
of E brings 
you to F 
sharp.

 Chapter 4: Navigating Sheet Music
Book II

The distance between the consecutive white piano keys E and F, and B and C, 
equals a half step, whereas the distance between the remaining white keys 
(G-A, A-B, C-D, D-E, F-G) is a whole step. That’s because the piano is designed 
around the C scale.
Changing pitch with accidentals
Accidentals are notations used to raise or lower a natural note pitch on the 
staff by a half step. They apply to the note throughout a measure until you 
see another accidental. You can use these different types of accidentals:
	
✓	Sharp (♯)
	
✓	Flat (   ♭)
	
✓	Double sharp (𝄪)
	
✓	Double flat (   𝄫)
	
✓	Natural (♮)
Sharps
A sharp is placed before a note to indicate that the note is a half step higher, 
as shown in Figure 4-12.
	
Figure 4-12: 
A sharp, the 
black key to 
the right of 
the A, is a 
half step up 
from A.
	

134
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
Figure 4-13 shows a sharped E (the enharmonic of F natural). E sharp is one 
half step up in pitch from E.
	
Figure 4-13: 
E to E sharp.
	
Flats
A flat does just the opposite of a sharp: It lowers the note by a half step, as 
shown in Figure 4-14.
	
Figure 4-14: 
A flat, the 
black key 
to the left 
of the A, 
is a half 
step down 
from A.
	
Figure 4-15 shows a flatted E. E flat is one half step down in pitch from E.
	
Figure 4-15: 
E to E flat.
	
Every once in a while, you’ll run into a double sharp or a double flat. The double 
sharp raises the natural note two half steps — or one whole step — whereas 
the double flat lowers the note two half steps, or one whole step.

135

Naturals: Cancelling sharps and flats
Last but not least is the natural, which you can see in Figure 4-16.
	
Figure 4-16: 
A natural 
cancels an 
established 
sharp or flat.	
	
When you see a natural sign next to a note, it means that any sharp or flat 
that’s already in effect (either given in the key signature or in the same mea­
sure; see Book III Chapter 5 for information on key signatures) is cancelled for 
the rest of the measure. In other words, you’re supposed to play the “natural” 
version of the note instead of whatever sharp or flat was in effect, even if it 
was a double sharp or double flat.
Mnemonics help you remember the notes
Having trouble remembering the names of the 
lines and spaces for each staff (and, conse­
quently, the notes they represent)? Use a mne­
monic, a word or phrase created from the letter 
names of these lines and spaces, to help you 
remember.
Try the following mnemonics, but feel free to 
make up your own. Unless otherwise noted, 
these mnemonics start on the bottom line of 
each staff and go up:
Treble clef lines (E-G-B-D-F):
	✓	Traditional: Every Good Boy Does Fine
	✓	Musical: Every Good Band Draws Fans
	✓	Pianistic: Even Gershwin Began (as a) 
Dummy First
	✓	Culinary: Eating Green Bananas Disgusts 
Friends
Treble clef spaces (F-A-C-E):
Bass clef lines (G-B-D-F-A):
	✓	Traditional: Good Boys Do Fine Always
	✓	Recreational: Good Bikes Don’t Fall Apart
	✓	Animal: Great Big Dogs Fight Animals
	✓	Musical: Great Beethoven’s Deafness 
Frustrated All
	✓	Musical: Grandpa Bach Did Fugues A lot
	✓	Painful: Giving Blood Doesn’t Feel 
Agreeable
Bass clef spaces (A-C-E-G):
	✓	Musical: American Composers Envy 
Gershwin
	✓	Animal: All Cows Eat Grass
Read enough of these mnemonics and you’ll be 
hard-pressed to forget them. Of course, if you 
do happen to forget these helpful tools, simply 
find the line encircled by the clef and move up 
or down the alphabet from there.

Musical Punctuation: Bar Lines
In addition to horizontal staff lines, music employs some vertical lines to 
help you keep track of where you are in the music, sort of like punctuation in 
a written sentence. Bar lines were introduced in Book II Chapter 3, but this 
­section goes into more detail.
A bar line divides music into measures or bars, breaking up the musical 
paragraph into smaller, measurable groups of notes and rests. Measures help 
organize both the writing and reading of music for the composer and the per­
former. Figure 4-17 shows you how bar lines are written.
	
Figure 4-17: 
Bar lines 
divide 
music into 
measures.
	
	
Be prepared to see a few other types of bar lines in piano music. They give you 
directions on how the music is structured, when and where to repeat, and 
when to stop. Following are the names of the five types of bar lines and details 
on what they tell you to do:
	
✓	Single: Go on to the next measure.
	
✓	Double: Proceed to the next section (because you’ve reached the end of 
this one).
	
✓	Start repeat: Repeat back to this measure.
	
✓	End repeat: Repeat back to the measure that begins with a start repeat 
(or to the beginning if you don’t see a start repeat).
	
✓	Final: You’ve reached the end! Stop playing!
Figure 4-18 shows you what each one looks like.

s soon as the music starts, you hear beats as a constant, ever-present 
force. But you can do a lot more than playing a note on every darn one 
of those beats.
This chapter shows you some ways to play around with the way rhythms 
interact with the beat, whether that means holding notes longer, playing off 
or around the beat, or even not playing at all. (For a review of the basics of 
rhythm and beats, check out Book II Chapters 2 and 3.)
Getting a Jump on the Start: 
Pickup Beats and Measures
You’ve probably heard the old adage, “Everything starts from nothing.” Well, 
some songs actually begin with rests. That’s right: The performer walks out 
on stage, sits at the piano, and rests for a few beats before hitting a single 
note. You may like a long and boring explanation of why some music starts 
with rests, but you’d probably prefer a clear explanation of pickup beats and 
measures.
Here’s an easy example: The first two notes of the song “She’ll Be Coming 
Round the Mountain” actually fall on beats 3 and 4 of a measure of 4/4 time. 
(Book II Chapter 3 tells you about time signatures.) These two melody notes 
are called pickup notes, because they pick up in the middle of the beat and 
start the song. How nice of them! To play “She’ll Be Coming Round the 
Mountain,” you start with a half rest and count “1, 2, She’ll be . . .” as shown 
in Figure 5-1.

138
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
	
Figure 5-1: 
Starting 
with a half 
rest.
	
Rather than note a bunch of rests at the beginning, the composer can opt to 
write a pickup measure, which contains only that part of the measure that’s 
played or sung. In other words, the pickup measure simply eliminates any 
rests before picking up the tune. Figure 5-2 shows the notation in a song with 
a pickup measure.
	
Figure 5-2: 
Starting 
with a 
pickup 
measure.
	
To play and count songs with pickup measures, follow three easy steps:
	
1.	 Note the meter.
	
2.	 Rest for the number of “missing” beats.
	
3.	 Play the pickup notes, and away you go.
	
Hundreds of songs begin with pickup measures, including “When the Saints Go 
Marching In” and “Oh, Susannah.” Listen to Tracks 10 and 11 to get a feel for 
these great songs. If you’re ready to play these songs with pickup measures, 
you can find the music for them at the end of the chapter.
Adding Time to Your Notes 
with Ties and Dots
Ties and dots are more than accessories and designs to spice up your 
­wardrobe. In music, they’re symbols that add more time or length to your 
notes. A quarter or half note doesn’t quite cut it? Need to play the note a little 
bit longer? Just throw in some of these value-adding notations to extend the 
length of your notes.

139
 Chapter 5: Varying Beats and Rhythms
Book II
Understanding 
Theory and 
the Language 
of Music
Linking notes using ties
Let’s review a minute: Half notes and whole notes last longer than one beat. 
But suppose you want to play a note that lasts longer than one measure or a 
note that lasts for two and a half beats? Music’s solution is a curvy little line 
called the tie.
The tie does just what it sounds like: It ties two notes of the same pitch 
together, causing one continuous-sounding note. For example, a whole note 
tied to a quarter note lasts for five beats. Likewise, a quarter note tied to an 
eighth note is held for one and a half beats. Figure 5-3 shows you a few notes 
that are tied together, as well as how to count them.
	
Figure 5-3: 
Ties that 
bind notes 
of the same 
pitch.
	
	
As mentioned earlier in this book, don’t mistake a tie for a slur. They look 
­similar because they’re both curved lines, but a tie connects two notes that 
are the same pitch from notehead to notehead. In contrast, a slur connects 
notes of different pitches.
	
Listen to Track 12 and try to play along with Figure 5-3. When you see two 
notes tied together, play the first note and hold it for the combined value of 
both notes.
Extending notes using dots
Another way to extend the length of a note, and make it look a little fancier, 
is through the use of a dot. A dot on any size note or rest makes that note or 
rest last 50 percent longer.

140
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
Dotted half notes
A quarter note lasts one beat, a half note lasts two, and a whole note lasts 
four. You can see that you’re in need of a note that lasts three beats. Probably 
the most common dotted note in music is the dotted half note, which gets a 
total of three beats, as shown in Figure 5-4.
	
Figure 5-4: 
The dotted 
half note.
	
This note gets a lot of use in 4/4. In 3/4 time, it takes up the entire measure. 
Figure 5-5 shows dotted half notes in action and tells you how to count them.
(To play a melody with dotted half notes, turn to the section “Playing Songs with 
Challenging Rhythms” at the end of the chapter for the music to Scheherezade.)
	
Figure 5-5: 
Dotted half 
notes in 4/4 
and 3/4 time.
	
Dotted quarter notes
When you add a dot to a quarter note, you get a great hybrid note that lasts 
for one and a half beats. Because of its length, the dotted quarter note is 
commonly paired with an eighth note in order to finish out the second beat 
(see Figure 5-6).
	
Figure 5-6: 
A dotted 
quarter note 
paired with 
an eighth.
	

141
 Chapter 5: Varying Beats and Rhythms
Book II
Understanding 
Theory and  
the Language 
of Music
Dotted eighth notes
The dotted eighth note equals one and a half eighth notes, or three sixteenth 
notes. As you know from Book II Chapter 1, it takes four sixteenth notes to 
make one quarter note (or one beat). So, a dotted eighth note is often paired 
with a sixteenth note to make a full quarter note beat. In this combination, 
the normal eighth note beam connects the two notes, and the sixteenth note 
gets a shortened second beam (see Figure 5-7).
	
Figure 5-7: 
A dotted 
eighth, a 
sixteenth, 
and their 
beams.
	
Get some practice reading and playing some dotted notes with the exercise 
in Figure 5-8. Work on developing the kind of flexible counting system shown 
in the figure. You count only quarter notes in the first measure, then count 
out eighth and sixteenth notes for the measures that require that type of 
breakdown. When you’re out of the rough in the last measure, you can go 
back to counting quarter notes. Just make sure you keep the beat steady!

“Swanee River” is a classic example of both dotted quarter notes and dotted 
eighth notes. Listen to it until you get the feel of the rhythm, and when 
you’re ready to play the song, check out the later section “Playing Songs with 
Challenging Rhythms.”

Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
Playing Offbeat Rhythms
When you understand note values and ways to extend those values with 
ties and dots, you can expand your rhythmic range with some fancy ways to 
divide, delay, anticipate, and swing note values. After all, you live in a world 
filled with rhythm, and most of the music you hear day in and day out is 
­surprisingly rhythmic, thanks to the influence of jazz, blues, and plenty of 
other folk and popular music from all around the world.
This section expands your musical knowledge with many of the fascinating 
rhythms you need to know to play your favorite music, whether it’s jazz, 
­classical, popular, or folk tunes. Start off with triplets and then move on to 
swing rhythms and syncopation.
	
As you read the following sections about dividing the beat and playing notes 
off the beat, tap your foot along to the examples. Even when you don’t play a 
note right on the beat, you won’t lose the beat.
Triplets love chocolate
Most notes divide a beat neatly by some factor of two. But every now and 
then, you may want to divide a beat into more than two eighth notes but less 
than four sixteenth notes. That means playing three notes per beat, aptly 
called a triplet.
The most common triplet pattern is the eighth-note triplet, which looks like 
three beamed eighth notes. To help you spot these triplets quickly, composers 
add a little number 3 above (or below) the beam. A popular variation on this 
triplet pattern is the quarter-eighth triplet, which looks like (get this) a ­quarter 
note and an eighth note but with a little bracket and a number 3. Figure 5-9 
shows you both types of triplets.
	
Figure 5-9: 
Congrats! 
You have 
triplets.
	
	
You can hear an example of these triplets on Track 13 before you try to play 
them yourself in Figure 5-10.

143
 Chapter 5: Varying Beats and Rhythms
Book II
Understanding 
Theory and  
the Language 
of Music
	
To count these triplets, tap your foot and say “1 trip-let, 2 trip-let” or (if you 
like food metaphors) “choc-o-late” for every beat. The most important point 
is to divide the beat into three equal parts so each syllable gets its fair share.
	
Figure 5-10: 
Counting 
triplets.
	
Now try playing the triplets in Figure 5-11. Keep thinking “choc-o-late” until 
you’ve gotta take a candy bar break.
	
Figure 5-11: 
Practice 
with triplets.
	
	
You can make triplets using other note values, too, but you probably won’t 
have to play them for a while, at least not until you start jamming with your 
local drum circle. It’s worth remembering, though, that with any triplet 
rhythm, 3 = 2: Three quarter-note triplets equal two quarter notes (two beats), 
and three sixteenth-note triplets equal two sixteenth notes (half a beat). You 
play three notes (equally) in the time you would normally play two notes of 
the same value.
Swing and shuffle time
The beat may go on and on, but music can be quite dull if every note you 
play is on the beat. By changing up the rhythm a bit and playing some notes 
off, around, or in between the main beats, your playing takes on a whole 
new life.

144
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
	
For example: The swing beat. Listen to Track 14 while you look at the four 
­measures of music in Figure 5-12. The music track plays the eighth notes with 
a swing beat. The notes are the same, but the rhythm has a slightly different, 
swingin’ feel. Instead of straight eighth notes played as “1-and, 2-and,” you 
hear a long-short, long-short rhythm. The most accurate way to notate this 
swing rhythm is with a quarter-eighth triplet. (See the previous section for 
more on triplets.) But rather than write a ton of triplets, the composer gives 
you a big heads up along with the tempo indication above the first measure 
by telling you to “Swing,” either in plain English or with a little symbol like 
the one in Figure 5-13.
	
Figure 5-12: 
Swing those 
eighths.
	
	
Figure 5-13: 
This nota-
tion says 
swing it.
	
When you see the swing notation, you should play all the eighth notes in the 
music as swing eighths. You can still count them as “1-and, 2-and, 3-and, 4-and,” 
but the notes on the beats are longer and the notes off the beats are shorter.
	
The best way to understand the swing beat is to hear it. So popular is this clas­
sic American rhythm that it has its own type of bands and dance moves. Listen 
to some of the music of the big-band era, like the Duke Ellington Orchestra or 
the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra. They really had the whole world swingin’.
To play a song with swing eighths right now, skip to the song “By the Light of 
the Silvery Moon” in the section “Playing Songs with Challenging Rhythms” 
at the end of this chapter.

 Chapter 5: Varying Beats and Rhythms
Book II
Understanding 
Theory and  
the Language 
of Music
Shuffle feel has the same long-short swing eighths as swing time, but the 
shuffle beat is more readily associated with rock and blues-style music. 
A shuffle feel is characterized by a heavier beat than swing, which is lighter 
on its feet.
To play a song with a shuffle feel, skip to “I’ve Been Working On the Railroad” 
in the section “Playing Songs with Challenging Rhythms” at the end of this 
chapter.
Syncopation
One of the most common forms of playing off the beat is a little rhythmic 
­concept called syncopation. To understand syncopation, you have to know 
about downbeats and upbeats. Start tapping your foot to a moderate 4/4 beat, 
and count eighth notes “1-and, 2-and, 3-and, 4-and.” Your foot goes down on 
the downbeats and up on the upbeats.
Downbeats are the beats that are normally emphasized in a song. But 
through the miracle of syncopation, you emphasize some (or all) of the 
upbeats instead. You play those notes a little bit harder, or louder, than the 
others. For example, the note normally played on beat 3 is played on the 
upbeat before, and this anticipation naturally emphasizes the upbeat and 
­creates syncopation.
Figure 5-14 shows a two-measure melodic phrase written first to emphasize 
the downbeat on beat 3, and then transformed into a syncopated rhythm, 
with the arrows showing the point of emphasis on the upbeat, on “and” 
before beat 3.
	
Figure 5-14: 
Suddenly 
syncopa-
tion by 
emphasizing 
upbeats.
	

146
Book II: Understanding Theory and the Language of Music 
	
You can hear how syncopation works with a well-known melody. Listen to 
Track 15 while you follow along with the music in Figure 5-15. The track plays 
the opening four measures of the classic song “After You’ve Gone” first ­without 
any syncopation, and then with syncopation. Keep your foot tapping the beat 
throughout the entire eight measures and notice the emphasized notes on the 
upbeats (when your foot is up). The arrows mark the syncopated notes.

“After 
You’ve 
Gone,”

and with

syncopation.
	
If you’re feeling the off-kilter groove of syncopation and are ready to play a 
syncopated song, try “Limehouse Blues” in the next section.
Playing Songs with Challenging Rhythms
	
The songs in this section give you a chance to play music featuring the ­rhythmic 
tricks covered in this chapter, from pickup measures to ties and dots to swing 
eighth notes and syncopation.

147
 Chapter 5: Varying Beats and Rhythms
Book II
Understanding 
Theory and  
the Language 
of Music
Here are a few tips on each of the songs to keep in mind:
	
✓	“When the Saints Go Marching In” (Track 16): This song has a pickup 
measure with a three-beat pickup. The last measure has only one beat 
in order to make a complete measure. Note that this song also has ties 
and dots.
	
✓	“Oh, Susannah” (Track 17): This song has two eighth-note pickups, 
which equal one beat and are counted “4-and.” Notice how the last 
measure has only three beats; this is often done to complete the three 
missing beats in the pickup measure. Taken together, the pickup and last 
measure equal one complete measure.
	
✓	Scheherazade (Track 18): You find dotted half notes scattered 
­throughout waltzes and other songs in 3/4 meter, like the theme from 
Rimsky-Korsakov’s Scheherazade. Notice that this melody combines 
the use of ties and dots. The tie simply adds even more time to the 
dotted half note. For example, in the fourth measure, you hold the B 
note for four beats.
	
✓	“Swanee River” (Track 19): You hear dotted eighth notes in all types of 
music, but especially in dance tunes. Composer Stephen Foster made 
good use of dotted quarters as well as dotted eighths in his classic tune 
“Swanee River.” You may want to listen to the track a couple of times 
before trying to play it yourself.
	
✓	“By the Light of the Silvery Moon” (Track 20): The swinging rhythm of 
the lyrics helps you get the hang of playing swing eighth notes in this 
tune.
	
✓	“I’ve Been Working on the Railroad” (Track 21): The chug-a-lug train 
rhythm of this song matches a shuffle feel quite naturally. The eighth 
notes are swing eighths, but the underlying triplet feel is a bit heavier 
than in a swing feel.
	
✓	“Limehouse Blues” (Track 22): The melody to “Limehouse Blues” has 
built-in syncopation, and you get lots of practice with this tune: Every 
other measure has a syncopated note held by a tie into the following 
measure.

elodies create a wonderful transformation in music: They turn a whole 
bunch of random notes into songs that entertain, please your ear, and 
sometimes get stuck in your head. It would be safe to say that you aren’t really 
playing music unless you’re playing a melody.
	
To really get the most out of this chapter about melodies, you should have a 
foundation of basic knowledge — in this case, that means you should first read 
the chapters in Books I and II. Without these fundamentals, attempting to play 
melodies and songs may lead to frustration.
This chapter helps you start playing melodies by talking about how your 
hands fall on the keyboard and then explaining two common positions: C and 
G. Because not all melodies stick to these original positions, the chapter also 
instructs you in shifting and extending positions. You put these techniques to 
use playing melodies in classical, folk, and Tin Pan Alley styles.
Let Your Fingers Do the Walking
To play a melody on the piano, you need to observe the way your hands make 
contact with the keyboard. If you don’t develop comfortable moves, you’ll find 
it hard to reach the notes you need to play — and your playing will look and 
sound more like Charlie Chaplin than Chopin.
As discussed in Book I Chapter 5 — think of your fingers as being numbered 
1 through 5, with the thumbs being 1. This chapter refers to your fingers by 
number and to your hands by ultra-hip abbreviations: RH and LH. So, RH 1 
means the thumb on your right hand.

156
Book III: Beginning to Play 
In Figure 1-1, RH 2 plays D. Notice the relaxed but arched position of the hand 
and fingers. See, too, how the other four fingers are poised and ready to play 
the next note, whatever it may be.
	
Figure 1-1: 
Playing 
a key.
	
With correct hand position and fingering, your fingers literally walk along 
the keys. Practice enables them to walk with a fluid motion, with you guiding 
their movements.
	
As you play a melody, your fingers should travel gracefully up and down the 
keyboard. You aren’t typing a letter or playing video games, so there’s no need 
to punch or slap the keys.
Positions, Everyone!
So, you’re at the keyboard, your back is supported and straight, the lights are 
on, and the music’s waiting. Where does your right hand go? Good question. 
You need to get into position.
Position is a common term you hear regarding any musical instrument. Several 
positions exist for each musical instrument, giving the player points of reference 
all along the body of the instrument. The keyboard is no exception.

157
 Chapter 1: Playing a Melody
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
Using effective hand positions is vital to playing the keyboard well. From 
each designated position, you can easily access certain notes, groups of 
notes, and chords and then move to other positions.
	
When you sit down to play, survey the music to get a general idea of the hand 
positions the piece requires, and look for the hand position for the first notes.
C position
Many easy tunes start at middle C or close to it, so you often find yourself in 
C position at the beginning of a song. C position simply means placing your 
right-hand thumb on middle C and your other right-hand fingers on the four 
successive white keys, as shown in Figure 1-2. Put another way, RH 1 should be 
on C and RH 5 on G with the other three fingers in the middle. If the other three 
aren’t in the middle, something very unusual is going on with your fingers.
Figure 1-2: 
Getting into 
C position.
	
With your right hand in C position, which is sometimes also called first position, 
play the melody of “Frere Jacques” in Figure 1-3, playing one note at a time. It 
may be helpful to just imagine the moves your fingers will make as you listen to 
Track 23 a couple times before you attempt to play along.

158
Book III: Beginning to Play 
	
Figure 1-3: 
“Frere 
Jacques” 
with right 
hand in C 
position.
	
Be sure to observe the numbers above the notes. These numbers, called 
fingerings, tell you which finger to use for each note. Most players appreciate 
fingerings because they indicate the best possible finger pattern for executing 
the notes. Of course, you may invent other custom fingerings. For now, though, 
try the helpful fingerings.
Try another song that uses C position. In “Ode to Joy,” the melody begins on 
RH 3, travels up to RH 5, and then dips all the way down to RH 1. Beethoven, 
the composer of this piece, was a pianist, so no doubt he knew just how 
well this melody would play under the fingers. Figure 1-4 shows the opening 
melody to “Ode to Joy.”
	
Figure 1-4: 
The melody 
of “Ode 
to Joy.”
	
To play the full version of “Ode to Joy” right now, skip to the end of the chapter.
As you can probably imagine, not all melodies use only five notes. Eventually, 
you must come out of your safe little shell of five white keys, make a move, 
and extend certain fingers up or down. The following sections guide you 
through extensions from basic C position.
Thumbing a ride to B
From C position, your thumb can extend down to B. As you play B with your 
thumb, you simply leave your other fingers exactly where they are.

159
 Chapter 1: Playing a Melody
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
	
To play “Skip to My Lou” (Track 24) in Figure 1-5, simply move your thumb one 
key to the left in measure 3 to play the B.
	
Figure 1-5: 
“Skip to My 
Lou” uses 
C position 
but extends 
your thumb 
to play B.
	
Good stretch, pinky!
From C position, RH 5 (right pinky) can reach up one key to the right to play 
A. In the campfire classic “Kumbaya,” you anticipate the extension up to A by 
shifting fingers 2 through 5 to the right from the very start. Notice this shift 
in the fingerings above the notes in Figure 1-6: Instead of playing D with RH 
2, you play E with RH 2, but keep your thumb on middle C. Note: “Kumbaya” 
begins with a two-beat pickup.
	
Figure 1-6: 
The 
melody of 
“Kumbaya”

position and

5 to play A.
	

160
Book III: Beginning to Play 
	
Don’t take the word stretch too literally. I don’t want you to injure yourself. It’s 
quite alright to allow RH 1 through 4 to move toward RH 5 as you reach up to 
play A.
Stretching C position to the limits
	
In many songs that begin from C position, you shift your fingers or extend RH 
5 and RH 1 to play all the melody notes. “Chiapanecas” is one such song. Using 
the music in Figure 1-7, try to play this Latin American song as it was meant to 
be heard: hot and spicy. You may want to listen to Track 25 before attempting 
it on your keyboard.
	
Figure 1-7: 
“Chiapa-
necas”

and shifts C 
position.
	

161

Check the time signature before you start playing. You don’t want to be thinking 
“1, 2, 3, 4” if the song is in 3/4 time. And, by the way, “Chiapanecas” is in 3/4 time.
G position
To get into G position, move your right hand up the keyboard so that RH 1 
rests on G. (This is the same G occupied by RH 5 in C position.) Figure 1-8 
shows you this new position as well as the staff notes you play in it. Notice 
that RH 5 now rests all the way up on D.
Figure 1-8: 
Gee, I like G 
position!

162
Book III: Beginning to Play 
The melody to “Little Bo-Peep” fits easily in G position. Give it a whirl by playing 
the music in Figure 1-9.
	
Figure 1-9: 
“Little 
Bo-Peep” is 
a breeze in 
G position.
	
Just like in C position, in G position you can extend RH 5 and RH 1 east and west 
to access E and F, respectively. Try out this extended G position by playing “This 
Old Man” in Figure 1-10. Watch the fingering in this song and shift your fingers 
where appropriate.

“This Old 
Man” uses

Shifting your hand position as you play
Knowing two positions, C and G, is great, but you really only get five or six 
notes in each position. Shifting your hand to different positions in the same 
song allows you to play a few more notes. To shift positions in the middle 
of a song, you just need a bit of planning and practice. One strategy is to 
simply make good use of a rest in the music to make a move while you have 
the chance. (The next section covers other methods for movement when the 
music doesn’t provide rests in which to make the change.)
For example, in Figure 1-11 you play the first two measures in G position. During 
the rest on beat 4 of measure 2, you can move your hand down and get ready to 
play G in measure 3 with RH 5 — you’ve just shifted to C position.
	
Figure 1-11: 
One song, 
two hand 
positions.
	
Cross Your Fingers and Hope It Works
Shifting positions can be smooth and easy when rests are involved, but when 
the melody doesn’t stop, you must find alternative ways to move between 
positions. The best way is to use a little maneuver called finger crossing. 
Finger crossing is one of those techniques that can be awkward at first, but it 
has a whopping payoff once you get the hang of it.
	
Don’t try to make your hand, wrist, fingers, or arm do something impossible. 
When you cross over or pass under, let your hand and arm follow your fingers 
with easy, fluid movements. Try to keep your forearm and hand more or less 
perpendicular to the keyboard without any excess twisting.
If you really want to make strides with your technique, feel the unbound freedom 
that comes with smooth finger crossings, and work on other smooth moves up 
and down the 88s, check out the exercises in the chapters in Book V.

164
Book III: Beginning to Play 
Crossing over your thumb
Why cross over fingers when you can just move your hand? In C position, 
the thumb can sometimes extend to play B, but not always. For example, you 
may need to play B followed immediately by middle C. If you extend and con­
tract your thumb back and forth between these two keys, it sounds clunky. 
Instead, you cross RH 2 over your thumb to play B, as shown in Figure 1-12.
Figure 1-12: 
Crossing 
over your 
thumb to 
play more 
notes.
	
You can watch your hand on the keys when you cross over or under, but with 
practice you should easily feel where the keys are without looking. Whether 
you look or not, it’s important to keep a relaxed arch in the hand and avoid 
twisting your hand as you cross a finger over your thumb.
The well-known “Minuet” from Bach’s Notebook for Anna Magdelena Bach 
requires your RH 2 to cross over your thumb. As you can see in Figure 1-13, 
you shift positions briefly in measures 3 and 11, but the main focus is on the 
finger cross to B in measures 7 and 15.

Passing your thumb under
You can pass your thumb under RH 2 to move to a new position. The song “Row, 
Row, Row Your Boat” gives you a chance to try out this little switch-o-rama 
between positions (see Figure 1-14). You start with your right hand in C position 
(middle C to G), but in measure 3 you pass your thumb under RH 3 to play F, 
and then you play the G at the beginning of measure 5 with RH 2. You’ve shifted 
your hand position with a pass under! You then continue with your hand in this 
new position. Your hand position will naturally shift downward from the high C 
in measure 5 as you follow the tune back to C position by measure 6, where you 
stay to finish the song.

Playing Melodies in the Right Hand
	
When you know the techniques for playing melodies in the right hand, you’re 
guaranteed to want to put them to use playing more melodies. The following 
are four well-known melodies that let you apply the hand positions, position 
shifts, and finger crossings covered in this chapter:
	
✓	“Ode to Joy” (Track 26): You can stay in C position for almost the whole 
melody. In measure 12, you make a shift to reach with RH 1 and play the 
low G, which is the only note outside of C position.
	
✓	“Autumn” (Track 27): Your RH stays in G position for this melody from 
Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons. Because of the many repetitions, this melody 
is a good one for practicing rhythm and counting.
	
✓	“Oranges and Lemons” (Track 28): This English folk song lets you 
practice shifting hand positions. Start in C position, move to G position 
in measure 8, and return to C position in measure 16 to repeat the open­
ing phrase. Remember to make use of the rests to facilitate the position 
shifts.
	
✓	“Simple Melody” (Track 29): Irving Berlin’s tune gives you the chance 
to practice passing RH 1 under RH 2. Not so simple? The song is so 
catchy you won’t mind practicing until the movement feels natural.

✓	“Scales are boring!”
	
✓	“Scales are difficult!”
	
✓	“I never play scales!”
	
✓	“The scales in my bathroom read ten pounds more than I actually weigh!”
These statements are all lies, including the last one. For various selfish reasons, 
your friends don’t want you to know the truth: Scales are easy, scales can 
be fun, every musician plays scales, and your friends actually put on a few 
pounds over Spring Break.
You can use scales to do some great things on the piano — like play entire 
songs. Okay, not all scales are songs. But it’s true that all songs are created 
from scales, be it an entire scale or just a few notes from the scale. Remember 
the “Do-Re-Mi” song from The Sound of Music? The whole darn song is about 
scales, and those kids had fun.
This chapter shows you that it’s well worth it to give scales a chance. Besides 
using scales to understand the notes in a song’s melody, you can use scales 
to beef up your finger power on the piano. Plus, the more scales you know, 
the easier it becomes to play the piano.
	
You’ve probably heard this a thousand times before now, but it’s true: Practice 
makes perfect. This chapter introduces you to several different types of scales. 
Pick the ones you like and play through them five to ten times a day. This practice 
warms up your fingers and builds finger dexterity. Think of shooting baskets 
every day before the big basketball game. You wouldn’t go out on the court 
without a little practice, would you?

Building a Scale, Step-by-Step
Put simply, a musical scale is a series of notes in a specific, consecutive order. 
Major and minor scales are the two most common types, and they have the 
following attributes:
	
✓	They’re eight notes long.
	
✓	The top and bottom notes are an octave apart, so they have the same 
name.
	
✓	The series follows a stepwise pattern up and down, and the name of 
each note in the scale follows the alphabet up and down.
Each scale gets its own wacky-sounding name, like C major. A scale derives 
its name from the following two things:
	
✓	The scale’s bottom note, or the tonic. For example, a C major scale starts 
on C.
	
✓	The stepwise pattern used to create the scale. Music has two kinds of 
steps — half steps and whole steps — which are the building blocks of 
scales.
The “major” part of C major means the third note of the scale is a major third 
above the tonic. (You can find more on intervals in Book II Chapter 4.)
To review for a second, look at your keyboard or Figure 2-1. As you know 
by now, some white keys have a black key in between and some don’t. 
On a piano keyboard
	
Figure 2-1:

173
 Chapter 2: Working with Scales
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
	
✓	Two keys side by side (whether black or white) are one half step apart.
	
✓	Two keys separated by one other key (black or white) are a whole step 
apart.
	
✓	Two half steps equal one whole step.
Book II Chapter 4 explains how the suffixes sharp and flat are used to name 
the black keys. When you measure half steps up or down, you help define 
the black keys as sharps and flats. For example, find any D on your keyboard. 
Move one half step higher and play the black key to the right, D sharp. Now 
play one half step lower than D, or D flat.
Knowing these basic facts about scales, you can build any scale starting on 
any root note simply by applying the correct scale pattern (or combination of 
whole and half steps).
Introducing Major Scales
The two scales you most frequently use — and the most famous scales in 
Western music — are the major and the minor scales. You can make a major and 
a minor scale starting with any note on the piano. The difference between these 
two scales is the pattern of whole and half steps that you use to build them.
Major scales have a reputation for sounding happy, and minor scales get the 
sad rap, but it’s really how they’re used that counts.
Understanding major scales
Every major scale is built the same way. Don’t let a scale salesman try to sell 
you a new and improved major scale — there’s no such thing. (Actually, you 
should turn and run from anyone pretending to be a scale salesman.)
The ascending step pattern used by all major scales on the planet is
Whole-Whole-Half-Whole-Whole-Whole-Half (or WWHWWWH)
For example, you can form a C major scale by starting on C and applying this 
pattern. Play any C, and then play the major scale pattern of whole steps and 
half steps all the way to the next C. Figure 2-2 shows you the way. Starting 
with C, the layout of the white keys follows the scale pattern exactly, so you 
play the entire C major scale on white keys only.

174
Book III: Beginning to Play 
	
Figure 2-2: 
The C major 
scale ­follows 
all the white 
keys.
	
	
Pass your thumb under and cross over your thumb in the appropriate spots 
in order to successfully play up and down the scale. See Book III Chapter 1 for 
more on this finger-crossing business.
	
When playing most scales up and down, it’s important to realize that the scale 
pattern is exactly reversed on the way down. All you have to do is remember 
which keys you played going up and then play the same ones in reverse order 
going down.
Why sharps and flats are involved
And now for something slightly different: Start on G and apply the major 
scale pattern. When you get to the sixth step, notice that a whole step up 
from E requires playing a black key, F sharp. Figure 2-3 shows you the G major 
scale in all its glory.
	
Figure 2-3: 
The G 
major scale 
employs 
one sharp: 
F sharp.
	
The tonic note and scale pattern determine which notes will be sharps and 
which will be flats. G major uses one sharp. How about a major scale that uses 
one flat? Start on F and apply the pattern, as shown in Figure 2-4, and you’ve 
built yourself the F major scale, which uses B flat. (Note the new fingering for 
this scale pattern.)

175
 Chapter 2: Working with Scales
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
	
Figure 2-4: 
The F major 
scale uses 
B flat.
	
	
How do you know it’s B flat and not A sharp (its enharmonic)? Excellent question. 
The easy answer is that in a scale, every letter name has its turn. Because the 
third note, or scale degree, of the F major scale is A, the fourth note takes the 
next letter’s name — B flat (one half step higher than A).
Take your newfound major scale knowledge and see how it applies to a portion 
of a song. “Joy to the World” (see Figure 2-5) opens with a complete descending 
C major scale and continues with an ascending pattern from the fifth degree 
of the scale up to the eighth to end the phrase.
	
Figure 2-5: 
A joyful 
melody 
made from a 
major scale.
	
Of course, the composer of a song isn’t obligated to use every note from a 
scale in the melody. The scale is simply a menu to choose from. For example, 
“The Farmer in the Dell” (see Figure 2-6) is based on the F major scale, but it 
doesn’t actually use the note B flat.
	
Figure 2-6:

melody 
needs only 
five notes 
of the major 
scale.
	

176
Book III: Beginning to Play 
Major scale degrees
Each of the eight notes in a major scale is assigned a scale degree according 
to the order it appears in the scale:
	
✓	1st note: Tonic
	
✓	2nd note: Supertonic
	
✓	3rd note: Mediant
	
✓	4th note: Subdominant
	
✓	5th note: Dominant
	
✓	6th note: Submediant
	
✓	7th note: Leading tone (or leading note)
	
✓	8th note: Tonic
The 1st and 8th notes, the tonics, determine the name of the scale. (Scales that 
share the same starting notes are called parallel scales. For example, C major 
and C minor are parallel scales, because they both start on the same note: C.) 
Relative to the tonic note, the rest of the notes in the scale are usually attached 
to the numbers 2 through 7 (because 1 and 8 are already taken by the tonic). 
Each of these numbers represents a scale degree, and their pattern of whole 
steps and half steps determines the key of the scale.
	
The 1st and the 8th notes have the same name here because they’re the 
exact same note — at the 8th note, the scale repeats itself. You won’t hear a 
musician talk about the 8th degree of a scale — instead, she’ll refer to the 
1st note as the tonic.
So, for example, if you’re playing a piece of music in the key of C major, which 
sequentially has the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and C in it, and someone asks you 
to play the 4th and 2nd notes in the scale, you play an F and a D. And you do the 
same thing if that person asks you to play the subdominant and the supertonic.
	
Mastering scales is all about recognizing patterns. If you look at a piano 
keyboard, can you see where the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of each scale go? For the 
major scales, remember, the pattern is WWHWWWH. If you’re given a scale 
and asked to play the sequence 5-3-2-1-6-4-5-8, do you know what notes you 
would play? Eventually, you want to be able to answer yes to these questions 
for all 12 major scales. Here’s how:
	
✓	Picture each scale in your head and where it’s located on the keyboard.
	
✓	Know the letter name and number of each note in each scale.
	
✓	Be able to play sequences of notes when given the key and number.

177
 Chapter 2: Working with Scales
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
Only when you can do all three things for the 12 major scales can you stop 
practicing your scales.
	
Every single major scale you work with follows the WWHWWWH pattern, using 
different combinations of black and white keys on the piano, depending on the 
scale. To play each major scale on the piano, begin with the piano key that is the 
name of the scale. For the A major scale, for example, you begin with the A. 
Then play the major scale pattern: WWHWWWH. The scale ends on the same 
note it began with, only an octave higher.
	
To see the major scale for every key, refer to Chapter 8, which illustrates key 
signatures by showing the scale on the staff for each key. To hear all the major 
scales, listen to the tracks listed in the upcoming section “Listening to the 
major scales.”
Trying a major scale exercise
Practice playing up and down the C major scale with the exercise in Figure 2-7. 
You can use it to reinforce the scale pattern mentally, perfect your fingering, 
and improve your finger crossing. Start out at a slower tempo and increase the 
speed as you become familiar with the notes and the moves.
	
Figure 2-7: 
Building 
your C major 
scale chops.
	
Introducing Minor Scales
You need to understand something right away: Minor scales are no less 
important or smaller in size than major scales. They just have an unfortunate 
name. Minor scales come in a few varieties, each of which is covered in this 
section.

178
Book III: Beginning to Play 
	
Like major scales, minor scales have eight notes, with the top and bottom 
(tonic) notes having the same name. But minor scales have their own, unique 
scale patterns: the natural minor, harmonic minor, and melodic minor 
patterns.
Each of the eight notes in a minor scale has a name:
	
✓	1st note: Tonic
	
✓	2nd note: Supertonic
	
✓	3rd note: Mediant
	
✓	4th note: Subdominant
	
✓	5th note: Dominant
	
✓	6th note: Submediant
	
✓	7th note: Subtonic
	
✓	8th note: Tonic
	
In the harmonic and melodic minor scales, the 7th degree is called the 
leading tone.
Natural minor scales
The natural minor scale uses the following ascending stepwise pattern:
Whole-Half-Whole-Whole-Half-Whole-Whole (or WHWWHWW)
Sure, it may look similar to the major scale pattern, but make no mistake, this 
slight rearrangement of half and whole steps makes all the difference in the 
world. The best way to understand the difference is to play and listen to a 
major and a minor scale side by side. Figure 2-8 shows the C major scale, 
followed immediately by the C minor scale.
	
Figure 2-8: 
Major and 
minor C 
scales.
	
Hear the difference? Try something else: Play the melody in Figure 2-9, where 
the notes of a C minor scale are plugged into the same rhythms as the ­original 
“Joy to the World.” Notice the difference in the sound.

179
 Chapter 2: Working with Scales
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
	
Figure 2-9: 
“Joy to the 
World” in C 
minor.
	
	
You can play a minor scale on only the white keys, too — just start with A 
instead of C. Apply the same scale pattern to the tonic note A, and you get the 
A natural minor scale. (That’s because A is the relative minor of C. Book III 
Chapter 5 goes into more detail about that.) But apply the same pattern to 
other tonic notes and you encounter some minor scales with sharps (like 
E minor) and some with flats (like D minor), as you can see in Figure 2-10.
	
Figure 2-10: 
So many 
minors, not 
enough 
chaperones.
	
The notes from minor scales make great, memorable melodies, too. Skip to the 
later section “Playing Songs Made of Scales” and try “House of the Rising Sun.”

180
Book III: Beginning to Play 
Harmonic minor scales
The harmonic minor scale differs from the natural minor scale (refer to the 
preceding section) by only one half step, but in making that slight change, you 
achieve a scale with a whole new sound. For example, to play the A harmonic 
minor scale, follow these steps:
	
1.	Start out playing the A natural minor scale.
	
2.	When you get to the seventh note, G, raise it one half step to G sharp.
	
	 This change makes the distance from the sixth to the seventh scale degree 
one and a half steps and gives the harmonic minor scale its unique sound.
The complete pattern for an ascending harmonic minor scale is this:
Whole-Half-Whole-Whole-Half-1½-Half (WHWWH1½-H)
Play and compare the natural minor scale in Figure 2-11 with the harmonic 
minor scale next to it. Sounds rather exotic, doesn’t it? You’ll encounter this 
scale in lots of classical piano music.
	
Figure 2-11: 
The 
A ­natural 
minor and 
A harmonic 
minor scales.
	
Melodic minor scales
Another variation on the minor scale is the melodic minor scale, which is 
notable (forgive the pun) because it has a different pattern depending on 
whether you’re going up the scale or coming down. That’s right — a chameleon-
like scale that ascends one way and descends another. This flexibility is useful 
when you want the scale to sound, you guessed it, melodic. Try playing the 
A melodic minor scale in Figure 2-12, and you’ll hear that the scale sounds 
pleasingly melodic going both up and down.

181
 Chapter 2: Working with Scales
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
	
Figure 2-12: 
The A 
melodic 
minor scale.
	
Notice that the sixth and seventh degrees of the scale are raised a half step 
when ascending and are lowered a half step when descending. You probably 
recognized that the descending scale is identical to the natural minor scale, 
so only the ascending pattern is really new:
Whole-Half-Whole-Whole-Whole-Whole-Half (or WHWWWWH)
Composers sometimes combine scales for a song’s melody just to spice 
things up a bit. In the section “Playing Songs Made of Scales” later in the 
chapter, play “Greensleeves” to hear a good example.
Trying minor scale exercises
Get some practice with the C natural, harmonic, and melodic minor scales 
by playing the following exercises (Figures 2-13a, 2-13b, and 2-13c). You can 
use these as a warm-up along with the C major scale exercise in the previous 
section.
Using scales any which way you like
Major and minor scales are definitely the most 
popular scales, but they aren’t the only ones. 
Come on, admit it — you’ve experimented a 
little with these scale patterns. Curiosity begs 
you to insert a half step in place of a whole step 
sometimes to hear what happens.
Well, what happens is that you begin to form 
other scales, venturing into territory neither 
major nor minor. Some sound great, some sound 
not so great, and some sound sort of exotic. 
Creating your own scales is not only acceptable, 
it’s recommended. Fresh new scales inevitably 
give birth to fresh new melodies and harmonies.
People have experimented with scale patterns 
since the dawn of music, so go ahead and make 
up your own scales. Improvise a melody or a 
bass line using just a few notes of a scale. Write 
them down on staff paper, tape them to your 
walls, and decorate your life with scales!

Checking Out Blues Scales
Another very cool scale is the blues scale. You can hear it in rock, country, 
jazz, and of course . . . the blues.

183
 Chapter 2: Working with Scales
Book III
Beginning

This scale is a real rebel, practically throwing the rules of scale building out 
the window. Of course, there aren’t really any hard-and-fast rules for scale 
building, but this scale is rebellious anyway. Here’s how:
	
✓	It begins with one and a half steps.
	
✓	It has only seven notes.
	
✓	It has two half steps in a row.
Here’s the step pattern for this seditious little scale:
1½-Whole-Half-Half-1½-Whole (1½WHH1½W)
To try it out, play the scale in Figure 2-14.
	
Figure 2-14: 
Getting the 
blues.
	
Where else have you seen a scale with that much mojo? After you know the 
blues scale, playing it is as addictive as eating peanuts. You can use the notes 
in the blues scale, or blue notes, for all kinds of little riffs and melodies, like 
the one in Figure 2-15.

Playing Songs Made of Scales
	
In the age-old battle between theory and practice, there’s no doubt that practice 
is more fun. Your efforts to grasp the theory behind scales throughout this 
chapter will be rewarded by putting them to good use playing the songs in this 
section.
Here are a few tips on the tunes:
	
✓	“Danny Boy” (Track 30): The classic “Danny Boy” uses all the notes 
from the F major scale, even good old B flat.
	
✓	“House of the Rising Sun” (Track 31): “House of the Rising Sun” is 
based on the E natural minor scale.
	
✓	“Greensleeves” (Track 32): “Greensleeves” uses the A natural minor 
scale (measures 1–5), the A melodic minor scale (measures 13–16), and 
the G major scale (measures 17–20). It’s just a folk song, but they were 
some smart folk who wrote it!

ant to know an industry secret? Many a keyboardist or pianist who 
plays with a band never even uses the left hand. Oh sure, you think 
the left hand is playing because it’s moving up and down the left side of the 
keyboard and you’re hearing lots of bass lines and chords. But au contraire, 
mon frére. The bass player fills in the bass notes; the guitarist covers the 
chords. The not-so-good keyboard player just fakes it.
Playing the piano with your left hand, or both hands together, is considerably 
more difficult than just right-hand playing. But you have no need to fake your 
way through a career. You can show those phonies how a real player does it! 
This chapter tells you how to get both hands jamming together.
This chapter numbers your fingers 1 through 5. Your right and left hands are 
abbreviated as “RH” and “LH.”
Exploring the Keyboard’s West Side
If you consider middle C the middle of the keyboard, you can think of the 
keys to the right of middle C as the East Side and the keys to the left of 
middle C as the West Side. It’s time to head west.
To explore the lower keys, first reacquaint yourself with the bass clef. Book II 
Chapter 4 has some easy ways to remember the lines and spaces on this 
oft-neglected staff, but the best way to figure out this staff is to dig in and 
start playing. You’ll soon recognize each line and space by sight, without 
even thinking about it.

188
Book III: Beginning to Play 
Moving into position
Book III Chapter 1 shows you two positions for the right hand: the C and G 
positions. These positions are the same for the left hand except that C posi­
tion has LH 5 (pinky) on the C below middle C, the second space up on the 
bass clef staff. In G position, LH 5 moves down to G, the bottom line of the 
staff. Figure 3-1 shows you the proper left-hand C position placement.
Figure 3-1: 
Assume 
C position 
with the left 
hand.
Getting used to the new neighborhood
You have several options for playing with your left hand: You can play scales, 
melodies, simple one-note harmonies, chords, or just plain cool-sounding 
accompaniment patterns. Single-note harmonies and chords are covered in 
Book III Chapters 4 and 6, respectively.
For a quick (and stimulating) drill, Figure 3-2 helps limber up the left-hand fin­
gers in C position. Sing or say out loud the name of each note as you play it. 
Seeing, playing, saying, and hearing all at once go a long way toward helping 
you remember the notes on the staff.

Figure 3-3 features a similar workout, but in G position. Again, remember to 
sing each note out loud. Never mind what those around you think of your 
ranting and raving — they’re just jealous that you can play the piano.
Change your life by switching hands
If you aren’t left-handed by nature, you can 
start training it to be more than useless. Start 
using your underappreciated left hand to per­
form everyday tasks you normally perform with 
your right hand, such as the following:
	✓	Opening doors
	✓	Flipping channels on the TV remote
	✓	Steering your automobile (just be careful)
	✓	Eating
	✓	Brushing your teeth
	✓	Opening tightly-sealed pickle jars (good 
luck)
By consciously switching hands for a couple of 
weeks, you subconsciously make your left hand 
stronger, more versatile, and more independent.

If you’re ready to play songs with both hands, skip ahead to the section 
“Playing Songs with Both Hands” at the end of the chapter.
Left-Hand Melodies
Sometimes it’s nice to play a melody with your left hand. You may tire of playing 
with your right hand, want to hear the melody lower, want to add a little variety 
to the song — or have an itch on the right side of your head.
Whatever the reason, playing melodies with the left hand helps familiarize 
you with the bass clef notes while strengthening your left-hand coordination.
	
Left-hand melodies are lots of fun, but remember to observe the correct 
fingerings as you play these classics, “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot” (Track 33, 
see Figure 3-4) and “Little Brown Jug” (Track 34, see Figure 3-5).

South-Paw Scales
Scales may not be the most exciting things to play, but by playing left-hand 
scales you unwittingly master the following music essentials:
	
✓	Reading the bass clef
	
✓	Playing with the correct fingering
	
✓	Using nifty patterns and harmonies
	
✓	Realizing how much you miss playing with the right hand
Start with some major and minor scales by reading and playing the following 
scales left-handed. (Book III Chapter 2 tells you all about major and minor 
scales.) As with right-handed playing, remember to use the correct fingerings 
as indicated by the numbers above each note. How and when you cross your 
fingers is very important for obtaining a smooth sound and comfortable 
left-hand technique.
C, G, and F major
Figure 3-6 shows three major scales for the left hand. You can use the same 
fingering, both up and down the scale, for all of these. Applying the major 
scale pattern, you play a scale with no sharps or flats (C major scale), one 
sharp (G major scale), and one flat (F major scale).

you shift your hand position. Listen for smooth transitions and an even touch 
throughout each scale.

Book III: Beginning to Play 
Accompaniment Patterns
Scales and melodies are fine material for the left hand, but they aren’t Lefty’s 
main gig. Rather, your left hand begs to be playing accompaniment patterns 
while your right hand noodles around with a melody or some chords. One of 
the most user-friendly left-hand patterns is the arpeggio.
	
Oh, no! More Italian? Yes, in addition to pizza, rigatoni, and ciao, the other 
Italian word that should be part of your everyday vocabulary is arpeggio. The 
word translates to “harp-like,” which means absolutely nothing to piano 
­players. However, after many years of bad translations, musicians have come 
to understand it to mean “a broken chord.”
Well, nothing’s really broken about an arpeggio — it works great. You simply 
play the notes of a chord one at a time, rather than all at once.
Three-note patterns
Three-note patterns are probably the easiest and most versatile left-hand 
accompaniment to play, and they fit the hand really nicely, too. For example, 
place your left hand on the keys in C position with LH 5 on C, LH 2 on G 
above that, and LH 1 on middle C. Fits like a glove, right?
	
The three notes you use for this pattern are the root, fifth, and top (octave) 
notes of the appropriate scale. (See Book III Chapter 2 for more on roots and 
scales.) Using the C major scale, for example, the notes are C, G, and C. Now 
comes the versatile part: The three-note pattern is the exact same in the C 
minor scale. So, you can apply the three-note pattern to major or minor 
harmonies by playing the root, fifth, and top notes of the scale, as shown in 
Figure 3-9.

Root-fifth-
top patterns

Playing the pattern in quarter notes
The easiest way to start playing this three-note pattern is with a quarter-note 
rhythm. In 4/4 meter, you play in an “up and back” motion — root, fifth, top, 
fifth — so that every measure begins with the root note of each arpeggio. In 
3/4 meter, you play upwards — root, fifth, top — and then start again with the 
root for the next measure.
Figure 3-10 demonstrates these three-note patterns with a simple quarter-note 
rhythm in both meters. The first eight measures show how the pattern works 
in 4/4, and the next eight do it in 3/4. The letter names above the staff are 
chord symbols, which tell you the scale the pattern is derived from.

arpeggios in

Cranking up the pattern in eighth notes
Play the three-note pattern using eighth notes for a more energetic, faster 
arpeggio. You play a full set of root-fifth-top-fifth for every two beats, so that 
beats 1 and 3 of every measure start again on the root note of the arpeggio. 
Gently rock your left hand back and forth over the keys until you feel this pat­
tern is second nature to you. These eighth notes in 3/4 meter are slightly dif­
ferent: You can play all six eighth notes in a pattern or modify the pattern to 
give you time to move to other positions, as shown in Figure 3-11.

Four-note patterns
Adding another note to the three-note pattern gives you enough notes to 
make a major or minor chord. For this arpeggio, you add the third note of the 
scale. The four-note major arpeggio uses the root, third, fifth, and top notes 
of the scale. To form a four-note minor arpeggio, you simply lower the third 
note a half-step. For example, the notes of a C major arpeggio are C, E, G, and 
C. To make a C minor arpeggio, simply lower the third, E, to E flat, just like 
you do in the C minor scale (see Figure 3-12).

Four-note 
arpeggios.
	
Playing the pattern in quarter notes
As with the three-note arpeggios, different meters allow you some ­rhythmic 
options. Using quarter notes in 4/4 meter, you play up — root, third, fifth, 
top — once in each measure. Each subsequent measure begins again with 

197
 Chapter 3: Adding the Left Hand
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
the root note. For 3/4 meter, you play up in one measure — root, third, 
fifth — and hit the top note before coming down in the next measure — top, 
fifth, third.
Take a gander at the quarter-note patterns in Figure 3-13. Call out the name of 
each note as you play; hearing yourself helps you recognize the notes.

Try the alternate fingerings in Figure 3-13, shown in parenthesis below the 
suggested fingerings. Every hand is different, and you may find one of these is 
more comfortable than the other.
Cranking up the pattern in eighth notes
With an eighth-note rhythm, you can have fun exploring different patterns 
for the four arpeggio notes. Just keep the correct four notes of each scale in 
mind — root, third, fifth, and top — and play two of them for every beat in 
the measure. Figure 3-14 gives you a few examples of different patterns.

Adding the Left Hand to the Right Hand
No matter how much you enjoy playing melodies with the right and left 
hands separately, the time comes when you have to get them together.
	
You have several things to keep in mind when you attempt to play songs 
hands-together:
	
✓	When playing music from the grand staff, read the notes vertically 
(bottom to top) before moving on horizontally (left to right).
	
✓	Play the song a couple of times with the right hand by itself. Then play 
the song a few times with the left hand only. When you’re confident with 
the notes for each hand, you can try playing the song hands-together.
	
✓	Play slowly at first and speed up the tempo as you become more com­
fortable with the song.
	
✓	Be patient and calm.
Arpeggio, your friend in need
So, there you sit. It’s late. The pianist finishes 
“My Funny Valentine” and heads off for an 
overdue coffee break. You decide to impress 
your friends and quickly steal up to the bench. 
The room is waiting. You open the songbook 
atop the piano and — egad! — all you see is a 
treble staff and chord symbols.
What you see is probably a fake book. This is a 
real songbook, but it only contains the melody 
and chord symbols, allowing a working pianist 
to “fill in” the left hand as he or she feels best 
suits the situation. Of course, you aren’t a work­
ing pianist, and any left hand would be suitable 
for this late-night situation.
First, take a deep breath. Next, open your bag 
of tricks and pull out some left-hand arpeggios. 
Use the chord symbols — the little alphabet let­
ters above the staff — to locate the name of the 
lowest note (or root note) of the arpeggio and 
play away. Pretty soon you’ll have new friends.

Sharing the melody in both hands
	
Start reading from the grand staff by passing a melody between your hands. In 
Figure 3-15 (Track 35) the melody to “When Johnny Comes Marching Home” 
starts in the left hand, and the right hand takes over as it climbs into a higher 
range. Go over the note names once or twice before you play in order to get 
comfortable recognizing all the notes and switching between the bass and 
treble clefs. Then you can make an easier transition to the keyboard.

Melody plus one note
	
Mozart knew how to have a little fun with music, and it shows in his piece 
called “A Musical Joke” (Track 36). He takes a simple melody and tries it in a 
major scale, then in a minor one, and finally settles on the major version. In 
Figure 3-16, the left hand plays a single-note accompaniment to the melody, 
making it a good introduction to playing “hands-together,” as the saying goes.

“On Top of Old Smoky” (Track 37, Figure 3-17) gets you working a melody with 
the right hand and some arpeggios with the left. After you get the hang of it, your 
left hand starts rocking back and forth effortlessly on the arpeggiated patterns.

If the bass clef gets too intimidating to read, hold your left hand in position for 
an arpeggio and move LH 5 to each new root note. From each root note you 
can easily find the appropriate arpeggio notes and go to town . . . or to the top 
of Old Smoky.
Melody in unison octaves
In the classic “Yankee Doodle” (see Figure 3-18), you can try another way of 
reading from both clefs at once with a double-handed melody. Although the 
melodies look completely different on the different staves, they’re actually 
the same — you play the same named keys with both hands.

Most people have faster note recognition reading the treble clef than reading 
the bass clef at this stage. For a challenge, look at the note in the bass clef 
before you look at the corresponding note in the treble clef to solidify your 
bass clef reading skills.
Playing Songs with Both Hands
	
You’re ready for some two-handed music-making, and you’re looking for some 
tunes that put it all together. Well, you’ve come to the right place — the songs 
in this section utilize both hands. Here are a few things you need to know in 
order to play them:
	
✓	“The Sidewalks of New York” (Track 38): For this song, you need to be 
able to read bass clef, play a (mostly) one-note accompaniment in the 
left hand, read sharps, and play in 3/4 time. Oh, and you should enjoy 
the swaying rhythm, too.
	
✓	“Stars and Stripes Forever” (Track 39): You need to know about pickup 
measures, playing in 2/4 time, and playing a left-hand accompaniment 
pattern with a melody.

hen you listen to music, the melody is usually the first thing to grab 
your ear. You’re less aware of the other notes being played along with 
the melody to form the harmony of the music.
Without harmony, you would hear one single note at a time. On your piano, 
you can play more than one note at a time, giving it the coveted distinction 
of being an instrument capable of harmonizing. Sure, other instruments in a 
band or orchestra can play collectively to form harmony, but you can harmonize 
all by yourself with a piano.
Playing many notes simultaneously is the essence of harmony. The notes you 
choose and how you arrange them around the melody determines the kind of 
harmony you produce, whether you use many notes or just one note with each 
hand. Go ahead and try it: Play two, three, four, even ten notes at once. Ah, sweet 
harmony . . . or a cluttered mess, depending on what notes you play.
Musical form means the structural blueprint used to create a specific type of 
music. For example, a sonata follows a specific song structure. Although style 
elements like the basic melody, theme, and key signature would be entirely 
up to you, the way the sonata as a whole fits together — the beginning, 
middle, and ending — is set right from the beginning by the constraints of the 
sonata form itself.

210
Book III: Beginning to Play 
A lot of crossover exists between the definitions of form and genre, but they 
are two different concepts. Genre is more about how music sounds, regardless 
of its structure; examples are jazz, pop, country, and classical (although there 
are also certain forms unique to classical music).
The problem with identifying forms in modern music is that new music is still 
evolving. Students of music form in the 21st century may soon be studying 
anti-4/4 math-rock pioneers like Steve Albini alongside the composers Philip 
Glass and Beethoven.
Shaping the Melody
Most often, the melody is the part of the song you can’t get out of your 
head. The melody is the lead line of a song — the part that the harmony 
is built around, and the part that gives as much glimpse into the emotion 
of a piece as the rhythm does. (Refer to the later section on harmony for 
more information.)
Much of melody’s expressive power comes from the upward or downward 
flow of pitch. The pitch of a song goes up, and it can make the song sound 
like it’s getting either more tense or more lively; the pitch of a song goes down, 
and it can give that part of the song an increased melancholic or dark feel. 
The shape of the pitch’s travels is called its contour.
Here are the four common melodic contours:
	
✓	Arch
	
✓	Wave
	
✓	Inverted arch
	
✓	Pivotal
Contour simply means that the melody is shaped a certain way; the shape of a 
melody is especially easy to pick out when you have the sheet music right in 
front of you. The possibilities for building melodic phrases (that is, starting 
at the I chord, going up to the IV or V chord, and ending at the I chord; see 
Book III Chapter 6 for more information about chord progressions) with just 
four basic contours are virtually infinite.
Figure 4-1 shows a stretch of music that has an arch contour. Note how the 
melody line in the treble clef first goes up in pitch from a low point to a high 
point and how it then goes back down again, creating the arch. When music 

211
 Chapter 4: Examining Form: Melody, Harmony, and Song Form
Book III
Beginning

goes up in pitch gradually like this, it results in an increase in tension in that 
section of the composition. The lower the pitch gets in such a gradual arch, 
the more the level of tension decreases.
	
Figure 4-1: 
Arch 
contour.
	
Figure 4-2 shows music with a wave contour. Note how the melody line goes 
up, and down, and up again, and down again — just like a series of waves.
	
Figure 4-2: 
Wave 
contour.
	
Figure 4-3 shows music with an inverted arch contour. You may have noticed that 
the music in Figure 4-3 looks a lot like that in Figure 4-1. The only difference is 
that the melody line in Figure 4-3 goes down in pitch and then up to the end of 
the phrase. Therefore, the phrase starts out sounding relaxed and calm but 
contains an increase in tension as the arch rises toward the end of the phrase.
	
Figure 4-3: 
Inverted 
arch 
contour.
	
Figure 4-4 shows an example of music with a pivotal contour. A pivotal melody 
line essentially pivots around the central note of the piece — in the case of 
the music in Figure 4-4, the E. A pivotal contour is a lot like a wave contour, 
except that the movement above and below the central note is minimal and 
continuously returns to that central note. Traditional folk music uses this 
melodic pattern a lot.

212
Book III: Beginning to Play 
	
Figure 4-4: 
Pivotal 
contour.
	
Any melody line in a piece of music generally falls into one of the preceding 
categories of contour. Try randomly picking up a piece of sheet music and 
tracing out the melody pattern yourself to see what we mean.
	
The range of a melody is determined by the interval between the highest and 
lowest pitches of the song. The rise and fall of tension is often proportional to 
its range. Melodies with a narrow pitch range tend to have only a slight 
amount of musical tension in them, whereas melodies with a wide range of 
pitches are more likely to have a greater level of tension. As the range of 
pitches in a song is widened, the potential for greater tension increases.
Measuring Melodic Intervals
The distance between any two musical notes is called an interval. You need to 
understand the concept of intervals and the notes that make up each interval 
so that you can identify the right notes for harmonies. But you also use intervals 
to identify and build notes in a melody. As you play or sing the notes of a 
melody, the melody can do one of three things: It can stay on the same note, 
it can go up, or it can go down. When it goes up or down, the question of how 
much leads to the subject of melodic intervals.
You measure an interval by the number of half steps and whole steps in 
between the two notes. But because this method involves lots of counting, 
memorization, and complicated arithmetic, there is an easier solution: Use 
the major scale as a measuring tape.
Each major scale contains seven different notes plus the octave — that’s 
eight notes that you can use to name intervals. For example, Figure 4-5 shows 
the ever-popular C major scale, with the notes numbered from 1 to 8.
	
Figure 4-5: 
Numbering 
the notes of 
the C major 
scale.
	

213
 Chapter 4: Examining Form: Melody, Harmony, and Song Form
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
	
Pick two notes and count the scale notes (not the piano keys) in between to 
find the name of the interval. For example, if you play the first note of the C 
major scale (C) followed by the fifth note (G), you just played a fifth interval. 
If you count the scale notes in between C and G, you get five — C, D, E, F, G. 
From C to E (the third note in the scale) is a third interval, and so on. Not much 
originality in these names, but is this easy or what?
	
You don’t have to start with the first note of the scale to make an interval of a 
fifth. This concept of intervals is all about distance. You can build a fifth on the 
note G by climbing up five scale notes to D. It’s easy to check yourself by 
counting the scale notes in between.
Figure 4-6 shows you the C major scale and its intervals.
	
Figure 4-6: 
A family of 
intervals on 
the C major 
scale.
	
The C scale is the example because it’s so easy, with no sharps or flats. However, 
this method of number-naming the intervals works for every single major scale. 
Simply write out the scale and number the notes from 1 to 8 — it works the 
same every time.
Interval shorthand
Like scales, intervals come in different varieties: major, minor, perfect, diminished, 
and augmented. Knowing these classifications helps you identify and build 
harmonies for the music you play. For example, if you want to build a minor 
chord to harmonize with a melody, you must use a minor interval. (Book III 
Chapter 6 tells you all about building chords.)
Here’s your guide to making different types of intervals:
	
✓	Major interval: Measure a major second, third, sixth, or seventh by 
matching the second, third, sixth, or seventh notes of the major scale 
and counting the half steps from the root note.
	
✓	Minor interval: You can make a second, third, sixth, or seventh interval 
minor by lowering its major counterpart a half step.

214
Book III: Beginning to Play 
	
✓	Perfect interval: This label applies only to fourths, fifths, and octaves.
	
✓	Diminished interval: You can make any interval diminished by lowering 
it a half step.
	
✓	Augmented interval: You can make any interval augmented by raising it 
a half step.
In an eternal attempt to be lazy, er, efficient, musicians use the following 
abbreviations when discussing intervals:
	
✓	M for major intervals
	
✓	m for minor intervals
	
✓	P for perfect intervals
	
✓	dim for diminished intervals
	
✓	aug for augmented intervals
	
✓	Numbers for the interval size, as in the number 5 for a fifth
So, when you see P5, you know it means a perfect fifth. When you see M2, it 
means a major second. When you see m6, it means a minor sixth.
Intervals can be measured upwards or downwards. That is, when you play a 
C-G fifth interval, you can say that G is a fifth above C or that C is a fifth below 
G. So, a descending interval is measured from the top note to the bottom note. 
Likewise, ascending means . . . oh, you can figure that out.
The rest of this section explains each interval on the scale and gives you an 
example of a well-known tune that uses the interval. You are strongly encouraged 
to play each example on your piano or keyboard. Nothing trains a musician more 
than playing and hearing at the same time. Put these intervals in your head along 
with the corresponding tunes, and you won’t forget them.
Seconds
The first interval you sing in the celebratory song “Happy Birthday” is a 
major second interval, or M2. Go ahead and sing it. “Hap-py Birth-” Stop! On 
“Birth” you jump up a major second interval. Using the C scale, M2 is the 
distance from C to D.
Another song beginning with a M2 is “London Bridge,” which you see in 
Figure 4-7. Every time you play the name of the bridge, you go up and back 
down a major second. Try it on your piano.

Figure 4-7: 
“London 
Bridge” 
uses major 
second 
intervals.
	
You create a minor second, or m2, simply by making the major second a half 
step smaller. In other words, play C to D flat. Think of m2 as the famous interval 
used in the Jaws theme by composer John Williams. Figure 4-8 shows you an 
m2 from Beethoven’s ubiquitous “Für Elise.” You’d recognize this melody 
anywhere, and now you can name the opening interval as an m2.

Beethoven’s

Thirds
The first four notes of Beethoven’s legendary Fifth Symphony employ a major 
third, or M3. If a composer could copyright an interval, Ludwig van Beethoven 
would have this one. And if that isn’t enough, Ludwig tried to claim the 
minor third, or m3, too, by using it in the next four notes of the theme. Play 
Figure 4-9, a snippet of the Fifth Symphony, and you’ll forever know major and 
minor thirds.

216

You also hear the M3 interval frequently in spirituals. Figure 4-10 demonstrates 
this interval in the songs “Amazing Grace” and “Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.”

spirits.
	
For some reason unknown even to Beethoven, an m3 seems to attract children. 
As you see in Figure 4-11, the opening notes of the children’s favorites “This Old 
Man” and “It’s Raining, It’s Pouring” form an m3, which is smaller than an M3 by 
a half step.

Fourths and fifths
The fourth interval gets the hyperbolic classification of being perfect when 
it’s five half steps above or below another note. From C up to F is a perfect 
fourth, or P4.
The sound of a P4 is perfect for conveying just about any kind of emotion. 
Composers use this interval to convey heroism, love, comedy, and even outer 
space in their melodies. It even crops up in folk songs! Play and sing the 
opening notes of “I’ve Been Working On The Railroad,” and you jostle back 
and forth on a P4 until the lyric “the” ruins the fun, as shown in Figure 4-12.
	
Figure 4-12: 
Perfect

interval in 
motion.
	
You can also remember the P4 interval going down and back up again in the 
theme of Schubert’s Unfinished Symphony (see Figure 4-13).
Another perfect interval is the perfect fifth, or P5. Why is this one so perfect? 
Practically any song ever written has at least one P5 interval somewhere in it. 
And, hey, it fits the hand nicely: from C up to G is C position.

As you play the first two notes of Figure 4-14, you may see stars. Both 
“Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star” and the theme to Star Wars begin with a P5.

A shining

Play a descending P5 from G to C, and you may recognize the immortal classic 
“Feelings” and the theme from the Flintstones TV show. Speaking of classics, 
the romantic standard “Just the Way You Look Tonight” also begins with a 
descending P5 to the words “Some day.” The Bach “Minuet” also opens with 
the descending P5, as you see in Figure 4-15.
	
Figure 4-15:

perfectly.
	
	
A handy way to remember perfect fourths and perfect fifths is by humming the 
opening bars of “Here Comes the Bride,” in which one interval conveniently 
follows the other (see Figure 4-16). By the way, “Here Comes the Bride” originates 
in the “Bridal Chorus” sung in the opera Lohengrin by Richard Wagner.
	
Figure 4-16: 
Perfect 
fourth 
and fifth 
together.
	
Between a perfect fourth and a perfect fifth exists an interval that’s exactly 
half of an octave (see Figure 4-17). From C, count up six half steps to F sharp, 
or G flat. If you call it F sharp, you call the interval an augmented fourth 
because it’s larger than a fourth but not quite a fifth. If you call it G flat, the 

219
 Chapter 4: Examining Form: Melody, Harmony, and Song Form
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
interval is a diminished fifth because it’s a perfect fifth lowered by one half 
step. Many people remember this interval by singing “Maria” from West Side 
Story — the first two notes are an augmented fourth.
	
Figure 4-17: 
Augmented 
fourth/
diminished 
fifth.
	
	
The augmented fourth/diminished fifth interval sounds very strange and 
sometimes even scary. That is why it’s sometimes called the Devil’s interval.
Sixths and sevenths
A major sixth, or M6, interval is the opening interval of “My Bonnie Lies Over 
the Ocean.” “My Bon-” is the M6 interval, from C to A. If you play C to A flat, you 
get a minor sixth, or m6. Figure 4-18 shows you both sixths.
	
Figure 4-18: 
Major and 
minor sixth 
intervals.
	
The major seventh (M7) and minor seventh (m7) are the last numbered intervals 
in the scale. You can call up a m7 by singing the first two notes of “Somewhere” 
from West Side Story (matching the first two words of the phrase, “There’s a 
place for us”). Not many songwriters begin a melody with a major seventh 
interval; perhaps that’s why there are few memorable examples.

220
Book III: Beginning to Play 
In any case, it’s an important interval to know because the seventh interval 
helps form the third most popular chord in all music. Get to know these two 
interval sizes and judge for yourself how melodic they are after you play the 
notes in Figure 4-19.
	
Figure 4-19: 
Seventh

heaven.
	
Octaves
You may think that the last interval in the scale would be called an eighth. 
You’re partly right. For some reason, interval namers (another short-lived 
profession) grew tired of using numbers after the seventh and tried to liven 
things up with a fancy word. They came up with the prefix octa, which means 
“eight.” An eighth interval is called an octave (P8). The interval-namers were 
so proud of their accomplishment that they classified it as a perfect interval.
Figure 4-20 shows you a perfect octave, an interval made memorable by Judy 
Garland singing “Over the Rainbow” in The Wizard of Oz. In the opening 
lyrics, from “some” to “where” is an octave leap. Another easy way to remem­
ber this interval is that both notes have the same name.

Combining Notes for Harmonic Intervals
In the preceding section, you play each interval as single notes to see and 
hear the distance between each. But that’s not harmony. You have to play the 
intervals together to get harmony.

Playing two notes together
Figure 4-21 shows each interval — perfect, diminished, augmented, major, 
and minor — from seconds to an octave. Try playing the notes of each interval 
at the same time. Notice that the notes in each interval are stacked. When two 
notes appear stacked, or attached to the same stem, you play them at the 
same time. You know, in harmony.
They sound perfectly lovely, but how do you use these intervals to create 
harmony? You can

✓	Play intervals in the left hand while the right hand continues the melody.
	
✓	Do both.

To start playing songs with harmonic intervals, skip ahead to the section 
“Playing Songs with More Harmony” at the end of the chapter.
Adding intervals to the melody
Adding harmonic intervals to the melody really fills out the sound. Figure 4-22 
shows the melody of “Aura Lee” as a single-note melody in the opening phrase, 
followed by the same melody played with right-hand intervals added below 
the melody for the second phrase. As you play both phrases, listen to the 
difference this harmony makes.

222
Book III: Beginning to Play 
	
Figure 4-22: 
“Aura Lee” 
is a melody 
that begs for 
harmony.
	
It’s not necessary for you to figure out how or when to add these intervals to 
a melody. The composer does that for you and notates these intervals in the 
printed music you play. But you should understand that all these intervals 
combine with the melody to make a very harmonic tune. Sure, you could just 
play the melody by playing only the top note of each group of notes, but your 
audience will appreciate the extra effort of playing the intervals. Besides, why 
do you think you have so many fingers?
	
Of course, if you want to add intervals to a melody yourself, try choosing the 
interval either a third below or a sixth below the melody note. Take a simple 
melody like “Yankee Doodle” and add an interval a sixth below each right-hand 
melody note. You can see how this is done in Figure 4-23.
Figure 4-23: 
Harmonizing 
“Yankee 
Doodle.”
	
If you’ve ever sung in a chorus or even made up a harmony to sing along to 
your favorite recording, you know that some notes sound good together and 
some don’t. Certain intervals sound more stable, or resolved, than others. The 
intervals that sound resolved are thirds, fifths, and sixths; seconds, fourths, 
and sevenths can sound unresolved. (Octaves sound good, of course, because 
they match the same notes as the melody.) Generally, stable intervals are more 
consonant (harmonious and agreeable), whereas unstable intervals sound more 
dissonant (discordant and jarring, like the Devil’s interval).

Harmonizing with the left hand
One of the easiest ways to add harmony to music is to play single notes with 
the left hand that form intervals when combined with the right-hand melody 
notes. Often, you simply play one note with the left hand and hold it for several 
measures as you continue with the melody.
In Figure 4-24, the right hand plays the opening phrase of “America, the 
Beautiful” while lefty plays single whole notes below. The harmonic intervals 
are simply moved an octave below, making use of the lower register of the piano 
and creating a nice, full sound.
	
Figure 4-24: 
”America, 
the Beau­
tiful” with 
single-note 
LH part.
	
You can fill out the sound even more by adding a harmonic interval to the 
left-hand part, as shown in Figure 4-25. When the left-hand part consists of 
whole- and half-note rhythms, adding this interval is easy enough.
	
Figure 4-25: 
Adding 
more har­
mony to the 
LH part.
	
In Figure 4-25 the left hand plays stable, resolved intervals (thirds and fifths) 
except in one place: The unresolved interval of a seventh on beat 3 in measure 3 is 
resolved to an interval of a third to end the phrase on a more consonant harmony.

224
Book III: Beginning to Play 
Another way to go is to add a harmonic interval below the melody in the 
right hand, plus add a bass note in the left hand, as shown in Figure 4-26.
	
Figure 4-26: 
Adding har­
mony below 
the melody 
in the RH 
part.
	
To give a song a little more movement, you can play a harmony part in the 
left hand that matches the melody note-for-note (see Figure 4-27).
	
Figure 4-27: 
The LH 
harmony 
matches the 
rhythm of 
the melody.
	
And for the ultimate in harmony, make it a four-part style with simple intervals 
in both hands. Just a couple of notes create a nice, full sound, as shown in 
Figure 4-28.

Working with Musical 
Phrases and Periods
Two of the building blocks of musical form are phrases and periods. A musical 
phrase is the smallest unit of music with a defined beginning and end. Most 
musical phrases consist of a beginning I chord progressing to a IV or a V chord 
and ending again on the I chord. Theoretically, thousands of chord progressions 
may exist between that first I chord and the IV or V chord. However, you may 
lose your audience in that time.
Musical phrases are like sentences in a paragraph — just as most readers 
don’t want to wade through a thousand lines of text to find out the point of a 
sentence, most music audiences are listening for the musical idea expressed 
in a phrase and get bored if it sounds like you’re just meandering between 
chords and not coming to a resolution.
So how long is a musical phrase? It’s really up to the composer, but generally, 
a phrase is usually two to four measures long. Within that space, a phrase 
begins, works through one or more chord progressions, and resolves itself 
back to the I chord.
When a composer really wants you to understand that a group of measures 
are to be linked together in a phrase and played as an important unit — kind 
of like a topic sentence in an essay — he or she links the phrase together 
with a curved line called a phrase line, as shown in Figure 4-29. Notice how 
the phrase both begins and ends on the I chord, or the G major chord.
	
Figure 4-29: 
Note the 
phrase line 
in the bass 
clef.
	
	
Don’t confuse phrase lines with ties and slurs. A phrase line ties an entire 
musical phrase together, whereas slurs and ties only tie together notes, or a 
small part of a phrase.

226
Book III: Beginning to Play 
The next larger unit used in musical form is the period. Musical periods are 
created when two or three musical phrases are linked together.
Figure 4-30 shows an example of a musical period.
	
Figure 4-30: 
A musi­
cal period 
is made 
of linked 
phrases.
	
Linking Musical Parts to Create Forms
The division of music into parts occurs when you link two or more periods 
that sound like they belong together. (See the preceding section for a discussion 
of periods.) They share major harmonic focal points, similar melody lines, and 
similar rhythm structure. They may have other resemblances, too. Parts can 
be further linked together to create musical forms.
Composers conventionally give alphabetic labels to the musical parts within 
a composition: A, B, C, and so forth. If a part is repeated in a song, its letter 
also is repeated. For example, ABA is a familiar layout in classical music, 
where the opening theme, or the main musical idea that runs through a song 
(labeled A), after vanishing during part B, is repeated at the end of the song.
As the contrast form, where you have different musical sections that can differ 
widely from one another, AB forms come in a boundless array of possibilities. 
You may see recurring sections, unique ones, or any combination of both. For 
example, a rondo — a popular form in classical music — alternates between a 
recurring section and others that occur one time each. A rondo, then, would 
be labeled ABACADA . . . (and so on).
You may even encounter an ongoing form, which has no recurrence what­
soever: ABCDE. . . . This form creates what’s known as a through-composed 
piece of music.
The following sections describe common forms you may encounter in music.

227
 Chapter 4: Examining Form: Melody, Harmony, and Song Form
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
One-part form (A)
The one-part form, also known as A form or unbroken form, is the most primitive 
song structure and is also sometimes referred to as the air form or ballad form. 
In a one-part form, a simple melody is repeated with slight changes to accom­
modate different words, as in a strophic song like “Old McDonald Had a Farm.” 
This song repeats the same musical line but changes the words with each verse.
The one-part form is mostly found in folk songs, carols, or other songs that 
are short and have a limited theme and movement. A forms come only in a 
single variety. They may be long or short, but they’re always described as A 
(or AA, or even AAA).
Binary form (AB)
Binary form consists of two contrasting sections that function as statement 
and counterstatement. The pattern may be a simple AB, as in “My Country, 
‘Tis of Thee,” or in simple minuets, where the form is usually AABB, with the 
second A and second B being variations of the first A and B.
	
In the binary form used in the Baroque period, the pattern can involve a 
change of key, usually to the key of the fifth of the original key if the piece 
is in a major key. Part A begins in one key and ends in the key of the fifth, 
while part B begins in the new key and ends in the original key. Each part 
is repeated, giving the pattern AABB.
Three-part form (ABA)
Songs frequently take the form ABA, known as three-part form or ternary/
tertiary form. This simple form is produced by varying and repeating the 
melody. For example, “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” states a tune, varies 
it, and then restates it (which makes it ABA form). The B part here may be 
called the bridge, or the link, between the two A parts.
Here’s how the three-part song form works:
	
✓	The first part, A, may be played once or repeated immediately.
	
✓	The middle part, B, is a contrasting section, meaning it’s different than 
the first section.
	
✓	The last part is the same or very similar to the first part, A.

228
Book III: Beginning to Play 
Three-part ABA form extends the idea of statement and departure by bringing 
back the first section. Both contrast and repetition are used in this form. Pop 
music is frequently a variation on ABA, called AABA, while blues is often AAB. 
AABA form is used in songs like “Over the Rainbow.”
Arch form (ABCBA)
Music written in arch form is made up of three parts: A, B, and C. In arch form, 
the A, B, and C are played sequentially, and then part B is played a second time, 
directly following the C, and the song ends with the replaying of the A part.
Playing Songs with More Harmony
Feeling ready to play songs with more harmony? Each of the following songs 
explores different ways to use harmonic intervals.
	
✓	“I’m Called Little Buttercup” (Track 40): In this song the left hand plays 
single bass notes while the right hand plays the melody. The two parts 
move in different ways, so if you find it difficult to play at first, be patient 
and practice each hand separately until you feel comfortable with the 
notes. Then play hands-together.
	
✓	“Marianne” (Track 41): You can see and hear the harmonizing power of 
two-note harmony in this song. It may be helpful to play the melody, right 
hand only, along with the track a couple of times. Then try the left-hand 
part only. When you’re relaxed and confident, put both hands together.
	
✓	“Aura Lee” (Track 42): Adding a melodic interval below the melody in 
your right hand and adding your left hand to the mix is simple to do, and 
oh so satisfying. If you get lost as you play, just slow down and try each 
hand separately until you feel like putting them together again. (You may 
recognize the melody as a song made famous by Elvis Presley. Elvis used 
different lyrics — something about loving him tender.)
	
✓	“Shenandoah” (Track 43): In this piece both hands play the same 
rhythm, with the left hand mirroring the melody with a soothing harmony 
line. Listen carefully as you play to match rhythms with both hands, 
just like two voices singing together.
	
✓	“Auld Lang Syne” (Track 44): Your left hand isn’t limited to single notes 
or certain intervals. The composer may give you seconds, fourths, or 
anything else. Give both hands a shot at some four-part harmony with 
this song, which mixes up several types of intervals in both hands. 
Practice each hand separately before putting the two together.

K

eys allow you to drive a car, open doors, and even read maps. Some 
keys may be frustrating when you misplace them several times a week, 
but they’re still handy and essential tools in life — and in music.
This chapter tells you about musical keys, and not the black and white ones 
you press when you play a keyboard. This is a completely, utterly, totally, 
wholly different type of key.
A key is a set of notes that corresponds to a certain scale (Book III Chapter 2 
tells you all about scales). Keys and scales provide a foundation of compat­
ible notes that composers and songwriters use to construct melodies and 
harmonies. Understanding them can go a long way toward deepening your 
understanding of the music you play.
Home Sweet Home Key
A musical key is a song’s home. The key tells you several things about a song: 
which sharps and flats are used, which scale the song is based on, which of 
the scale notes is the song’s home note — and much more.

236
Book III: Beginning to Play 
A song has a single home note, and all the other notes used in a song have a 
relation to that home note based on how far away or near they are to home. 
So understanding a musical key means also understanding the relationships 
notes have to one another. A song can be thought of as a musical journey, 
and understanding where a song begins and where it goes on its journey is 
part of the joy of making music.
When a song is in the key of C, for example, it means that the song is primar­
ily based on the C major scale, using mostly (or only) notes from that scale 
for the song’s melody and harmony. Throughout the song, your ears get 
comfortable with notes from the C major scale. If the composer throws in a 
slew of other notes from another scale (such as F sharp, which is not in the C 
major scale), it’s a bit unsettling to your ears. When the song returns to notes 
from the C major scale, your ears feel at home again.
	
The real definition of a song’s key is not, of course, a song’s home. As the 
musically minded will quickly point out, a song’s key is its tonal center, mean­
ing the tones of a scale that the melody and harmony of the song are centered 
around.
A whole ring of keys
Music uses many different keys that are named after the many different notes 
on your keyboard. In other words, you have a musical key for the notes A, B, 
C, D, E, F, and G, and yes, all the sharps and flats too.
	
Each key has its own unique character, look, feel, and sound. A composer uses 
a particular key to give his or her music the right sound and feeling. People 
have a lot of different and surprisingly passionate ideas about which keys 
sound best for which kinds of music. The best way to show you the difference 
keys can make to music is to have you play the same song written in two dif­
ferent keys. Play “Good Night, Ladies” (Track 45) as you see it in Figure 5-1, 
which is in the key of C.
	
You can also play “Good Night, Ladies” in any other key, such as the key of F 
(see Figure 5-2 and listen to Track 46). Although the intervals (the relationship 
of each note to the next) remain the same, the sound and character of the 
song change subtly simply by changing keys, in this case moving the song 
down to the key of F. (To read more about intervals, check out Book III 
Chapters 2 and 4.)

238
Book III: Beginning to Play 
	
Composers and performers find keys very, very helpful because they allow 
music to be modified to fit different performers. For example, if a composer 
writes a song in the key of G, but the melody is too high for a particular singer 
to sing, the song can be transposed (changed) to a lower key (like F or E) to 
accommodate the singer’s voice. The composer likes that the overall song 
isn’t affected, only the range, which is the highness or lowness of the melody. 
Transposition is a frequent occurrence in music.
Using keys to play music
As a performer, recognizing and reading keys is an invaluable skill — more 
so than just knowing how high or low a song sounds. Understanding keys 
helps you play better because the key of a song tells you which notes to play 
or not to play. For example, if you play a melody in the key of G, you mostly 
play notes from the G major scale. Your knowledge of scales (see Book III 
Chapter 2) reminds you that G contains the note F sharp, so you can expect 
to play all the Fs in the song as F sharps.
To conserve ink, composers employ a tool called a key signature. Placed just 
after the clef on every line of music, a key signature allows the composer to
	
✓	Avoid writing all those little tic-tac-toe symbols next to every sharp in 
the song.
	
✓	Avoid writing flats next to every flat in the song.
	
✓	Instantly tell the performer what key the song is in.
As the music you play becomes more and more complex, you don’t want to 
see sharps and flats cluttering the music you’re trying to read.
Reading key signatures
What does reading key signatures do for you?
	
✓	It makes reading music easier because you know what notes to expect to 
play in each key.
	
✓	It makes playing music more fun because you can start to identify what 
makes one song different from another if you understand the idea of 
songs being in a key.
	
✓	It’s a tool to help you remember the music, because you can identify 
a certain characteristic in the context of the key. For example, if the 
melody begins on the third note of the major scale and you know what 
key you’re in, you can right away play the first note of the song.

239
 Chapter 5: Keys, Key Signatures, and the Circle of Fifths
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
Figure 5-3 shows you two key signatures: one for the key of G and one for the 
key of F. The first shows a sharp symbol on the top line of the staff, which 
tells you to play every F as F sharp. The G major scale contains one sharp, so 
this must be the key of G. The second key signature uses a flat on the middle 
line of the staff, telling you to play every B as B flat. This must be the key of F 
because the F major scale has one flat, and that’s B flat.
	
Figure 5-3: 
The sign on 
the line.
	
	
You may think that only Fs on the top line are altered by the sharp in the key 
signature. Nope! The key signature applies to every F, not just the one on the 
top line. This, of course, is another time- and ink-saving decision.
	
The only time the same note is marked with a sharp or flat twice in a key sig­
nature is when you have two staves. In this case, you get one key signature on 
the treble staff and one on the bass staff, as shown in Figure 5-4.
	
Figure 5-4: 
A key sig-
nature for 
each hand.
	
Playing a melody with a key signature is no more difficult than playing a song 
without one. You just have to remember (with a little help from your friendly 
key signature) which notes to make sharp or flat throughout. Figure 5-5 fea­
tures the opening melody to a tune called “Worried Man Blues” in the key of G. 
When you play, keep in mind that all the Fs are actually F sharps.
Try the same song in the key of D, which has two sharps. Notice the key 
­signature in Figure 5-6 and remember to play all the Fs as F sharps and all 
the Cs as C sharps.

 Trying 
the same 
melody in 
the key of D.
	
To play the entire melody of “Worried Man Blues” with the left hand added, skip 
to the section “Playing Songs with Key Signatures” at the end of the chapter.
A key signature tells you instantly which key the song is in. You may be ­thinking, 
“Well, if I have to count all the sharps or flats and then figure out which scale 
they’re in, that’s not very instantaneous!” With a little experience, you’ll start 
to recognize the most common key signatures. Without counting, without 
­playing — without even thinking about it really — you’ll simply glance at the 
key signature and know immediately which key the song is in. Most beginning 
piano music sticks to the key signatures with few sharps and flats or none at all.
The Circle of Fifths
Lucky for you, there’s a method to the madness of key signatures, an order 
that starts with no sharps and flats and cycles the ring of keys to all twelve 
keys. Figure 5-7 shows the famous Circle of Fifths with the letter names for 
each possible home key, or tonal center. As you travel around the circle, you 
find each of the twelve keys in the Western tonal system. The numbers inside 
the circle tell you how many sharps or flats are in each key signature.

241
 Chapter 5: Keys, Key Signatures, and the Circle of Fifths
Book III
Beginning

Figure 5-7: 
The Circle of 
Fifths.
	
As you check out the Circle of Fifths, note the following important points:
	
✓	Each key is a fifth up from the previous key, circling clockwise. (See 
Book III Chapter 4 for the scoop on fifths and other intervals.)
	
✓	The key of C, at the top, has no sharps or flats.
	
✓	The keys on the right half of the Circle are all sharp keys, gaining one 
sharp at each position traveling clockwise from the top.
	
✓	The keys on the left half of the Circle are all flat keys, gaining one flat at 
each position traveling counterclockwise from the top.
	
✓	The three keys at the bottom of the circle can be either sharp or flat 
keys; the composer gets to decide.
Among the marvels of this oracle of tonality, the Circle shows the relation­
ship of the keys to each other. The keys that are neighbors have a lot in 
common, like seven of eight scale tones. Very often a song travels smoothly 
to a neighboring key during its musical journey. The keys that are farthest 
away from each other have little in common, and a musical journey from one 
side of the Circle directly to the opposite side sounds quite abrupt.
	
The order of sharps and flats as they’re written on the grand staff follows the 
Circle of Fifths, adding a sharp or flat in the same order as the Circle.
Key signatures with sharps
Suppose you want to play a song on the piano that has two sharps in the key 
signature. If you look at the Circle of Fifths in Figure 5-7, you can quickly see 
that the key with two sharps is two positions away from C, so the song is in 
the key of D.

242
Book III: Beginning to Play 
Eventually you want to be able to know what key a song is in without ­glancing 
at the Circle. Here’s how.
To read a key signature that contains sharps:
	
1.	Locate the last sharp (the one farthest to the right) on either the treble 
or bass clef.
	
2.	Move up one half step from the sharp to find the name of the key.
For example, if you have two sharps, F sharp and C sharp, the last one on the 
clef is C sharp. Up a half step from C sharp is D. Therefore, the song is in the 
key of D.
Figure 5-8 shows you key signatures for all sharp keys.
	
Figure 5-8: 
Sharp keys.
	
	
Naming keys with lots of sharps requires a bit of brain power because note 
spelling can get tricky. For example, on your piano keyboard the key one half 
step up from E is F. Technically, you can also spell F as E sharp. So, if the sixth 
sharp in the key signature is E sharp, you raise it one half step to determine the 
correct key, which is F sharp. You can’t determine the key to be G flat because 
you would be skipping the letter name F in the sequence of note names.
Key signatures with flats
	
To read a key signature that contains flats:
	
1.	Locate the next-to-the-last flat (the one that’s second from the right) in 
the key signature.
	
2.	The name of that flat is the name of the key.
For example, if you have three flats in a key signature — B flat, E flat, and 
A flat — the next-to-last one is E flat, and so the song is in the key of E flat. 
Figure 5-9 shows all the flat keys.
	
Figure 5-9: 
Flat keys.
	

243
 Chapter 5: Keys, Key Signatures, and the Circle of Fifths
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
	
The one key for which this naming method doesn’t work is the key of F. 
Because it has only one flat (B flat), there’s no such thing as a “next-to-the-last” 
flat for you to read. But all you have to do is remember that one flat in the key 
signature means that a song is in the key of F. You can also remember that F is 
the key with one flat because it’s one position before the key of C in the Circle 
of Fifths, or a fifth below C, so it must have one flat.
Leaving and returning to the home key
No matter what a home looks or sounds like, its basic purpose is to be the 
place you return to after you’ve been away. The same applies to keys.
Melodies and harmonies often venture outside a song’s basic key. Particularly 
in jazz music, performers lift the music and give it a fresh sound by explor­
ing notes and chords outside the original key. Composers as far back as you 
can imagine have used various keys to carry the music to new and unfamil­
iar places. After such an “out of key” experience, you feel a sense of coming 
home when the song returns to the original key.
	
To get a better grasp of this concept of musical travel, listen to a snippet of the 
song “After the Ball” on Track 47. It begins in the key of G and travels to the 
key of A for a few measures before returning home to G. Just by listening, see if 
you can tell when the song leaves the home key and when it returns home to 
its original key. Then listen to the piece again as you follow along with the 
music in Figure 5-10.
Give yourself a hand
An easy way to find the key signature for the 
most common keys uses mnemonics. All you 
need are five fingers and a decent memory.
The most common keys you’re likely to play in 
are C, F, G, D, A, E, and B. The first two are a 
piece of cake to remember: C has no sharps 
or flats, and F has only B flat. For the other 
five common keys (which happen to all have 
sharps), follow these steps:
	 1.	 Memorize the order G-D-A-E-B with a 
simple mnemonic of your choice:
	
	 Good Diamonds Are Expensive to Buy
	
	 Glass Doors Are Easily Broken
	
	 Grand Divas Aren’t Ever Bashful
	 2.	 Count out the keys in order on the fingers of 
one hand until you get to the key you need.
	
	 For the key of A, count G, D, A. How many 
fingers are you holding up? Three. The key 
of A has three sharps.
The sharps in a key signature always appear 
in ascending fifths, starting with F sharp. Thus, 
the three sharps in the key of A are F sharp, C 
sharp, and G sharp.

Did you hear it? In measure 5, the music begins to venture outside of the orig­
inal home key of G, and it starts to return safely and smoothly to the home

Finding minor key signatures 
and relative minors 
The Circle of Fifths works the same way for minor keys as it does for major 
keys. The minor keys are represented by the lowercase letters inside the 
Circle of Fifths shown in Figure 5-11.
	
The minor keys on the inside of the circle are the relative minors of the 
major keys on the outside of the circle. The relative minor and its major key 
have the same key signature. The only difference is that the relative minor’s 
scale starts on a different tonic, or first note. The tonic, or starting point, of 
a relative minor is a minor third — or three half steps — lower than its rela­
tive major key. But there is no difference in the key signature between a 
major key and its relative minor.

Book III

For example, C major’s relative minor is A minor (refer to Figure 5-11). A minor’s 
tonic note is A, which is three half steps to the left of C on the piano.
On sheet music, the relative minor is the note one full line or space below the 
major key note. C is in the third space on the treble clef, and A, its relative 
minor, is in the second space, below it.
	
On the piano, a major chord and its relative minor chord go together like 
bread and butter. Many, many songs use this chord progression because it just 
sounds good. (You can find more about chords and chord progressions in 
Book II Chapter 6.)
Reviewing All the Key Signatures
The following sections provide a rundown of the major and natural minor key 
signatures and a couple of octaves’ worth of notes in those keys, arranged in 
a scale. (The key signatures are ordered following the Circle of Fifths instead 
of alphabetical order.)
	
Don’t be thrown by the word natural when it’s used to describe minor key sig­
natures in this section. As Book III Chapter 2 explains, more than one kind of 
minor exists.

As you can see, the C major and the A natural minor have the same key signa­
ture (that is, no sharps and no flats) and the same notes in the scale because 
A is the relative natural minor of C. The only difference is that the C major 
scale starts on C, whereas the A natural minor scale starts on A.

Confused by the double naming here? Take a look at a keyboard, and you see 
that a black key doesn’t exist for C flat. Instead, you see a white key: B. C flat 
and B are enharmonic equivalents of one another, meaning they’re the same 
but with different names. All the notes in the key of B major and the key of C 
flat major sound exactly the same — they just use different musical notation. 
The same goes for G sharp natural minor and A flat natural minor — same 
notes, just different notation.
As the number of sharps has been going up by one at each stop on the Circle 
of Fifths, from this point on, the number of flats will be going down by one 
until returning to the 12 o’clock (C major/A natural minor) position.

Playing Songs with Key Signatures
	
The songs in this section give you a chance to read and play music written 
with key signatures. Here are some pointers as you prepare to play each piece:
	
✓	“Worried Man Blues” (Track 48): This is the full version of the song that 
introduces key signatures earlier in the chapter. Written in the key of G, 
it has one sharp (F sharp) to keep in mind. The left-hand part is pretty 
simple, but you may want to go over the fingering and position changes 
in the last five measures before you try it hands-together.
	
✓	“After the Ball” (Track 49): This is also the full version of a song intro­
duced earlier in the chapter. This one illustrates a melody in the key 
of G that makes a brief sojourn to another key before returning to the 
home key at the end. Check out the natural sign before the note C in the 
right hand, in measure 26. This helpful reminder cancels out the C sharp 
played two measures before.

  laying melodies is nice and all, but harmony is the key to making your 
music sound fuller, better, cooler, and just downright great. Playing 
chords with your left hand is perhaps the easiest way to harmonize a melody. 
Playing chords with your right hand, too, is a great way to accompany a 
singer, guitarist, or other performer. This chapter shows you step-by-step 
how to build chords and use them to accompany any melody.
Three or more notes played at the same time form a chord. You can play chords 
with one or both hands. Chords have but one simple goal in life: to provide 
­harmony. (Book III Chapter 4 tells you all about harmony.)
You may have encountered chords already in a number of situations, includ­
ing the following:
	
✓	You see several musical notes stacked on top of each other in printed 
music.
	
✓	You notice strange symbols above the treble clef staff that make no 
sense when you read them, like F♯m7(-5), Csus4(add9).
	
✓	You hear a band or orchestra play.
	
✓	You honk a car horn.

258
Book III: Beginning to Play 
Yes, the sound of a car horn is a chord, albeit a headache-inducing one. So 
are the sounds of a barbershop quartet, a church choir, and a sidewalk 
­accordion player (monkey with tip jar is optional). Chances are, though, that 
you probably won’t use car horns or barbers to accompany your melodies —
chords on the piano and keyboard are much more practical.
The Anatomy of a Triad
Chords begin very simply. Like melodies, chords are based on scales. (Book III 
Chapter 2 gives you the skinny on scales.) To make a chord, you select any 
note and play other scale notes at the same time.
Generally, the lowest note of a chord is called the root note. The root note 
also gives the chord its name. For example, a chord with A as its root note is 
an A chord. The notes you use on top of the root note give the chord its type, 
explained later in this chapter, starting with major and minor chords.
Most chords begin as triads, or three (tri) notes added (ad) together. Okay, 
that’s not the actual breakdown of the word, but it may help you remember 
what triad means. A triad consists of a root note and two other notes: for 
example, the root plus a third interval and a fifth interval. (Book III Chapters 2 
and 4 tell you about all the fun and games involved in intervals.)
Figure 6-1 shows a typical triad played on the white keys C-E-G. C is the root 
note, E is a third interval from C, and G is a fifth interval from C.
	
Figure 6-1: 
This C chord 
is a simple 
triad.
	
You build new chords by altering this C triad in any of the following ways:
	
✓	Raising or lowering notes of the triad by a half step or whole-step
	
✓	Adding notes to the triad
	
✓	Both raising or lowering notes and adding notes
For example, Figure 6-2 shows you four different ways to change the C triad 
and make four new chords. Play each of these chords to hear how they 
sound. The note intervals are marked in each chord.

Starting Out with Major Chords
Major chords are the most frequently used, most familiar, and easiest triads to 
play. It’s a good bet that most folk and popular songs you know have one or 
two major chords.
	
You make major chords with the notes and intervals of a major scale. (You may 
remember scales from Book III Chapter 2.) You build a major chord by starting 
out with a root note and then adding other notes from the desired chord’s 
scale. For example, suppose you want to build a G major chord. Play the root 
note G and add the third and fifth notes (or third and fifth intervals) from the 
G major scale on top of the root note.
Major chords, such as the four in Figure 6-3, are so common that musicians 
treat them as the norm. These chords are named by just the root, and musi­
cians rarely say “major.” Instead, they just say the name of the chord and use 
a chord symbol written above the staff to indicate the name of the chord.
	
Figure 6-3: 
Major 
chords.
	
Use fingers 1, 3, and 5 to play major chords. If you’re playing left-hand chords 
(see Figure 6-4), start with LH 5 on the root note. For right-hand chords, play 
the root note with RH 1.

Major

lefty, too.

“Playing Songs with Chords” at the end of the chapter and play “Down by 
the Station.”

Book III: Beginning to Play 
Branching Out with Minor Chords
Like the major chord, a minor chord is a triad comprised of a root note, a third 
interval, and a fifth interval. Written as a chord symbol, minor chords get the 
suffix m, or sometimes min. Songs in minor keys give you lots of opportunities 
to play minor chords.
	
Don’t be fooled by the name “minor.” These chords are no smaller or any less 
important than major chords. They’re simply built on minor scales, rather 
than on major scales.
You can make a minor chord two different ways:
	
✓	Play the root note, and add the third and fifth notes of the minor scale 
on top. For example, play A as the root note, and add the third note (C) 
and fifth note (E) of the A minor scale.
	
✓	Play a major chord and lower the middle note, or third interval, by 
one half step. For example, a C major chord has the notes C-E-G. To play 
a C minor chord, lower the E to E flat.
Figure 6-5 shows several minor chords. Play them to hear how they sound 
and then compare these chords to their major counterparts in Figure 6-3.
Just like playing major chords, use fingers 1, 3, and 5 for minor chords. For 
left-hand minor chords, play the root note with LH 5; for right-hand chords, 
play the root note with RH 1.

nificant,

with lots of minor chords, go to the section “Playing Songs with Chords” at

Exploring Other Types of Chords
Major and minor chords are by far the most popular chords, but other types of 
chords also shine in music. You form these other chords by altering the notes 
of a major or minor chord and/or by adding notes to a major or minor chord.

261
 Chapter 6: Building Chords to Accompany Melodies
Book III
Beginning

Tweaking the fifth: Augmented 
and ­diminished chords
Major and minor chords differ from each other only in the third interval. 
The top note, the fifth interval, is the same for both types of chords. So, by 
altering the fifth interval of a major or minor chord, you can create two new 
chord types, both triads.
An augmented chord contains a root note, a major third (M3) interval, and an 
augmented fifth (aug5), which is a perfect fifth (P5) raised one half step. Think 
of an augmented chord as simply a major chord with the top note raised one 
half step. Figure 6-6 shows several augmented chords.
	
Figure 6-6: 
Augmented 
chords raise 
the fifth one 
half step.
	
When writing the chord symbol, the suffixes for augmented chords include 
+, aug, and ♯5. One advantage of ♯5 is that it actually tells you what to do to 
change the chord — you sharp the fifth.
A diminished chord contains a root note, a minor third (m3) interval, and a 
diminished fifth (dim5), which is a perfect fifth (P5) interval lowered one half 
step. Figure 6-7 gives you a selection of diminished chords.
	
Figure 6-7: 
Diminished 
chords 
lower the 
fifth one half 
step.
	
Note the suffix used to signal a diminished chord in the chord symbol: dim. 
You may also see the suffix dim in the chord symbol, as in Fdim (Table 6-1, 
later in this chapter, offers a helpful guide to chord symbols.)
	
You may find it easiest to use fingers 1, 2, and 4 for augmented and diminished 
chords played with the right hand. For the left, try 5, 3, and 2.

262
Book III: Beginning to Play 
Figure 6-8 shows you an example of how you may encounter diminished 
and augmented chords in a song. The melody is the last phrase of Stephen 
Foster’s “Old Folks at Home.” Take these new chords for a spin and see how 
they subtly affect a song’s harmony.
	
Figure 6-8: 
Augmented 
and 
­diminished 
chords in

Waiting for resolution: Suspended chords
Another popular type of three-note chord, although it’s technically not a 
triad, is the suspended chord. The name means “hanging,” and the sound of a 
suspended chord always leaves you waiting for the next notes or chords.
The two types of suspended chords are the suspended second and the ­suspended 
fourth. Because of their abbreviated suffixes, these chords are often referred to 
as the sus2 and sus4 chords; you see them written as Csus2 or Asus4, for example. 
Here’s how you create them:
	
✓	Asus2 chord is comprised of a root note, a major second (M2) interval, 
and a perfect fifth (P5) interval.
	
✓	Asus4 chord has a root note, a perfect fourth (P4), and a perfect fifth (P5) 
interval.
	
The sus4 is so popular that musicians often just call it the sus chord. So, when 
the bandleader says to play “a sus chord on beat 1,” that probably means to 
play a suspended fourth. But asking for clarification is a good idea.
Figure 6-9 shows you some of these suspenseful chords.

263
 Chapter 6: Building Chords to Accompany Melodies
Book III
Beginning

Figure 6-9: 
Suspended 
chords.
	
	
What’s being suspended, exactly? The third. A suspended chord leaves you 
hanging, and its resolution comes when the second or fourth resolves to the 
third. This doesn’t mean that all sus chords have to resolve to major or minor 
triads; actually, they sound pretty cool on their own.
Fingering suspended chords is easy. For the right hand, use fingers 1, 2, and 5 
for sus2 chords; use fingers 1, 4, and 5 for sus4 chords. For the left hand, use 
fingers 5, 4, and 1 for sus2 chords; use fingers 5, 2, and 1 for sus4 chords.
	
Play along with Figure 6-10 (Track 50) and listen to how the chord that follows 
each sus chord sounds resolved.
	
Figure 6-10:

tension.
	

264
Book III: Beginning to Play 
Adding the Seventh for Four-Note Chords
Adding a fourth note to a triad fills out the sound. Composers often use chords 
of four notes or more to create musical tension through an unresolved sound. 
Hearing this tension, the ear begs for resolution, usually found in a major or 
minor chord that follows. These tension-filled chords make you want to keep 
listening, and to a composer, that’s always a good thing.
The most common four-note chord is the seventh chord, which you build by 
adding a seventh interval above the root note of a triad. Played on the piano 
by itself, the seventh interval may not sound very pretty, but it sounds good 
when you add it to a triad. In fact, the result is perhaps the third most popu­
lar chord in Western music. You’ll be amazed at how many great songs use 
chords with seventh intervals.
	
Each of the four types of three-note chords introduced earlier in this chapter — 
major, minor, augmented, and diminished — can become a seventh chord. 
Simply adding a seventh interval (the seventh note of the scale) on top of any 
of these triads makes that chord a seventh chord.
The basic seventh chord uses the minor seventh interval, which is the seventh 
note up the scale from the chord’s root but lowered one half step. For ­example, 
if the root note is C, the seventh note up the scale is B. Lower this note by a 
half step and you get a minor seventh above the C, which is B flat.
The four-note chords shown in Figure 6-11 are all seventh chords. The chord 
symbol is simple and easy: It’s the numeral 7 placed after the triad symbol.
	
Figure 6-11: 
There’s 
nothing 
plain about 
these 
­seventh 
chords.
	
The suffixes used by seventh chords are placed after the triad type’s suffix. 
For example, if you add a minor seventh to a minor triad, the suffix 7 comes 
after m, giving you m7 as the full chord type suffix for a minor seventh 
chord.

265
 Chapter 6: Building Chords to Accompany Melodies
Book III
Beginning 
to Play
To play seventh chords, use fingers 1, 2, 3, and 5 in the right hand. You may 
want to use RH 4 instead of RH 3 for certain chords, when the chord shape 
feels natural with RH 4. With the left hand, play the root note with LH 5 and 
the top note with LH 1.
To play Brahms’s “Lullaby,” featuring seventh chords in the left hand, skip to 
“Playing Songs with Chords” at the end of the chapter.
Reading Chord Symbols
When you encounter sheet music or songbooks containing just melodies and 
lyrics, you usually also get the little letters and symbols called chord symbols 
above the staff, as shown in many of the figures in this chapter. Knowing how 
to build chords from chord symbols is an extremely valuable skill. It equips 
you to make a G diminished chord, for example, when you see the chord 
symbol for it: Gdim.
	
A chord’s symbol tells you two things about that chord: root and type.
	
✓	Root: The capital letter on the left tells you the chord root. As with scales, 
the root note gives the chord its name. For example, the root of a C chord 
is the note C.
	
✓	Type: Any letter and/or number suffix following the chord root tells you 
the chord type, like m for minor and 7 for seventh chords. Major chords 
have no suffix, just the letter name, so a capital letter by itself tells you 
to play a major triad.
Music written with chord symbols is your set of blueprints for what type 
of chord to construct to accompany the melody. For any chord types you 
may come across in your musical life (and there are plenty of chords out 
there), build the chord by placing the appropriate intervals or scale notes 
on top of the root note. For example, C6 means play a C major chord and 
add the sixth interval (A); Cm6 means to play a C minor chord and add the 
sixth interval.
	
Figure 6-12 shows the tune “Bingo” (Track 51) with its chord symbols written 
above it in the treble staff. The notes in the bass staff match the chord symbols 
and show you one way to play a simple chord accompaniment in your left 
hand.

266
Book III: Beginning to Play 
	
Figure 6-12: 
Transforming 
chord 
­symbols into 
notes on the 
staff.
	
	
Play the chord with the melody note that’s directly below the chord symbol. 
The chord lasts until you see a chord change at the next chord symbol. So if 
you see a C chord at the beginning of measure 1, like in “Bingo,” play it on 
beat 1. If there isn’t a chord change, like in measure 5, you can play the C 
chord again, or not — your choice.
To play a song with chord symbols right now, skip to the section “Playing 
Songs with Chords” at the end of the chapter and play “Scarborough Fair.”
You may encounter many curious-looking chord symbols in the songs you 
play. Table 6-1 lists the most common and user-friendly chord symbols, the 
variety of ways they may be written, the chord type, and a recipe for building 
the chord. 
Note: The examples in the table all use C as the root, but you can apply these 
recipes to any root note and make the chord you want.

G — to illustrate how chord building works with different root notes and 
thus different scale notes. By the way, the resulting chord is called a Cmaj7♯5 
because you add the seventh interval and sharp (raise one half step) the 
fifth interval.

Book III: Beginning to Play 
Relating Chords to a Scale 
or Key Signature
Chords didn’t just pop up one day when some early musician tripped and fell 
over his lute, accidentally strumming the strings as he hit the ground. They 
have a logical relationship to scales and therefore to the concept of playing in a 
given key signature. (Flip back to Book III Chapter 5 for more on key signatures.) 
By understanding this relationship and memorizing it in all 12 keys, you give 
yourself a head start for anticipating what chords a song uses based on what 
key it’s in.
	
The use and study of note relationships and chords is called harmony. A specific 
series of chords is referred to as a harmonic progression or chord progression. 
You can find many great books, such as Music Theory For Dummies by Michael 
Pilhofer and Holly Day (Wiley, 2011) as well as videos, teachers, and schools to 
study more about these relationships; look for the general term music theory.
Recognizing the major scale chord tones
If you build triads from a major scale using only the scale tones, you get 
Figure 6-14. (A major scale is comprised of a note, then up two whole steps, 
a half step, three more whole steps, and a final half step. You can read more 
about these scales in Book III Chapter 2.)
	
Figure 6-14: 
The major 
scale triads.
	
Illustration by Jerry Kovarsky
You can see that there are major triads for the C, F, and G notes in this ­example. 
Minor chords occur on the D, E, and A notes, and the B is a diminished chord. 
Music theory uses Roman numerals to indicate the numbers — capital numer­
als for major chords and lowercase for minor. The chords are usually referred 
to by their number in the scale, so the first chord is the I (1) chord, the second 
is the ii (2) chord, and so on.

269
 Chapter 6: Building Chords to Accompany Melodies

to Play
So the I (1), IV (4), and V (5) chords are major. The ii (2), iii (3), and vi (6) 
chords are minor. And the vii (7) chord is diminished. Figure 6-15 shows the 
scale tone chords for a few other keys.

Trying a few common chord progressions
Some very common chord progressions have been used for countless hit 
songs over the years. The basic blues progression in Figure 6-16 has been 
used not only for blues songs but also for most of the ’50s and ’60s rock and 
roll songs. Think Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, and B.B. King. It uses the I, IV, 
and V chords from a given key, played in the order pictured. You can find 
many fancier variations of this setup, but this progression is the basis of the 
blues and early rock and roll.

progression.

Check out Track 53 to hear the blues progression chords.
	
The vertical slashes on the staff in Figure 6-16 are commonly used when 
writing a chord chart. They show you how many beats to play each chord 
and leave you free to play the chords however you want. Feel free to think 
of the chords and try to play these progressions in more than one key. 
Good luck!

Book III: Beginning to Play 
Countless pop songs from the ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s, as well as doo-wop vocal 
songs, are based on the four-chord sequence in Figure 6-17.

Rearranging the Order of the Notes: 
Chord Inversions
Always playing chords with the root at the bottom means you have to jump 
your hand around the keyboard, which can result in difficult, choppy-sounding 
playing. By simply rearranging the order of the notes of a given chord, you can 
make much smoother transitions. These different groupings of the notes are 
called inversions. Rearranging the order of the notes doesn’t affect whether a 
chord sounds major or minor.
The three triad inversions
You can play any three-note chord from three positions (Figure 6-18):
	
✓	The root position: The traditional note grouping (root, third, and fifth)
	
✓	The first inversion: The root note moved to the top of the chord (third, 
fifth, and then root)
	
✓	The second inversion: The third moved up on top of the root (fifth, root, 
and then third)

As you play the three inversions, you can hear that the chord quality sounds 
basically the same.
	
Listen to Track 55 to hear the chords and inversions shown in Figure 6-18.
Figure 6-19 shows you how to play the blues progression by always moving to 
the closest note to form the needed chord. Moving to the nearest note is called 
voice leading in music theory, where each note in the chord is considered 
a voice. Pay attention to the marked fingerings to play them as smoothly as 
possible.

You can apply the same concept to make the pop/doo-wop progression 
sound smoother as well, as shown in Figure 6-20; Example 1 uses the ii chord, 
or the Dm, and Example 2 uses the IV chord, the F major. Now it sounds like 
what you hear on recordings, right?

Three-note chords in your left hand
If you play an arranger keyboard or play in an ensemble with a bass player, 
you can use these types of inversions in your left hand for a smoother sound. 
Because the arranger style or the bass player always provides the root tone, 
you’re free to use these close inversions. Figure 6-21 shows some possible 
ways to play the three-chord rock sound with some rhythm added. Each 
example starts on a different chord inversion and uses different rhythm 
­patterns. If you have onboard drums, pick a simple rock pattern and play 
along with it. (Book VI Chapter 2 has the lowdown on playing with onboard 
rhythm patterns.) Repeat each two-bar phrase over and over.

You can do the same thing for the doo-wop chords in Figure 6-22. You have two 
variations for each starting chord inversion, one always using the straight 
repeated rhythm with good use of close chord movement, and the other 
varying the rhythm a bit more. Repeat each two-bar phrase over and over.

Figure 6-22 employs a time signature, 12/8, that you may not be familiar with. 
Each measure has 12 beats, and each group of three eighth notes forms a 
strong pulse. So it feels like each measure actually has four beats, with each 
beat getting three subdivided pulses: 1-2-3, 2-2-3, 3-2-3, 4-2-3.
	
Listen to Tracks 57 and 58 to hear the blues and doo-wop progressions played 
using left hand chord inversions (shown in Figures 6-21 and 6-22).
Two-handed chords in a pianistic style
When you’re playing chords on an acoustic piano or an electric piano, you 
use the closest inversion chords possible in your right hand and play the root 
note in your left hand — either a single note or two notes an octave apart for 
more power (best on acoustic piano). Figures 6-23 and 6-24 show the basic 
voicings and fingerings, and then examples with rhythm added to each hand.

Playing Songs with Chords
	
The songs in this section give you some experience adding chords to familiar 
songs. As you play the songs, try to identify the chords as you play them in 
the left hand and match them to the chord symbols written above the treble 
staff. First locate the chord root, then the third, fifth, and seventh (if included). 
If you notice any chord inversions, see how they affect the chord progression 
and melody.
	
✓	“Down by the Station” (Track 61): This song lets you play a few major 
chords with your left hand. If you play along with the audio track, you’ll 
notice that it plays both the chords and the melody. You can play the 
left hand part by itself until you get comfortable with the shape of the 
chords in your hand. Then add the melody.

275
 Chapter 6: Building Chords to Accompany Melodies
Book III
Beginning

✓	“Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child” (Track 62): This spiritual 
gives you practice playing minor chords and a couple of major chords, 
too. It also has some chord inversions, so if you need to brush up on 
inversions, review the previous section.
	
✓	“Lullaby” (Track 63): You’ll find all kinds of seventh chords in all kinds 
of music, from classical to pop. Johannes Brahms’s famous “Lullaby” is 
an example of how seventh chords can create a little harmonic variety. 
Just don’t let it lull you to sleep.
	
✓	“Scarborough Fair” (Track 64): This song is in a minor key — D minor. It 
gives you a chance to play chords in your left hand based on the chord 
symbols. If you have trouble building the chords, review the sections on 
major and minor chords earlier in this chapter. The bass clef staff is left 
open for you to write in the notes of each chord.
	
✓	“Red River Valley” (Track 65): This song calls for lots of chord 
­inversions. It has triads and seventh chords along with first, second, 
and third inversions and a few garden-variety root position chords. 
Notice how the left hand plays half-note chords, with a few quarter-note 
changes in important places. You can change the inversion of a chord 
when the chord symbols are infrequent, as in this folk song.

P

laying the right notes and rhythms of a song is important, but how you 
play is even more important. Playing music with feeling, technique, and 
passion makes a performance worth listening to. Dressing up the music and 
making it your own takes more than just playing the notes. And throwing in a 
few special effects doesn’t hurt, either.
Dazzling effects and techniques in your music keep the audience listening, 
sometimes even on the edges of their seats. With a little practice, all these 
effects are easy. And when you add them to the right spots in the music, your 
playing comes alive and you sound like a real pro.
Note: This chapter is mainly applicable to the piano, not to the electronic 
keyboard. Adding effects and flair to your keyboard playing is, to put it 
mildly, an entirely different ball game. Check out the chapters in Book VI for a 
whole lot more about that.
Dynamically Speaking
How loud you should play depends 5 percent on what the composer wants 
and 95 percent on how close your neighbors live. The composer usually 
requests that certain notes be played at certain volumes. Your neighbor 
usually requests that all notes be played in a sound-proofed box. These 
varying degrees of volume give the music a different dynamic. And that’s 
exactly what volume levels are called in music: dynamics.

284
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
As with TVs, car stereos, and crying babies, the world of volume has a wide 
range: from very soft to very loud. Composers are quick to realize this and 
tell performers exactly where to play in the volume spectrum. Of course, to 
make things a bit fancier, all dynamics in music are Italian words.
Starting with basic volume changes
When you talk about volume, you say something is loud or soft. This kind 
of description is always a good starting point. From there you can explain 
how loud or how soft. Music uses the same principle: You start with two little 
Italian words, piano (soft) and forte (loud), to describe the volume of notes.
	
The piano itself, formally known as the pianoforte, derives its name from the 
ability to play soft and loud. Why the name has been shortened to “soft” probably 
has something to do with cranky landlords.
By writing piano or forte under a melody line (called a dynamic marking), a 
composer tells you to play certain notes soft or loud. Many years and inkwells 
later, abbreviations for these words are now the norm. You see soft and loud 
marked simply as p and f, written in fancy, stylized fonts.
	
When you see a dynamic marking, whatever the requested volume may be, 
you continue to play at this volume level until you see a new dynamic marking.
Try basic dynamics out with a tune. Figure 1-1 has two phrases from “Hickory 
Dickory Dock” marked piano and forte. Bring out the dynamic contrast as you 
play it.
	
Figure 1-1: 
Dynamic 
contrasts of 
piano and 
forte.
	
Widening the range
If soft and loud were the only volume levels available, stereos and audio players 
would just have two volume buttons. But, as you know, anywhere you turn 
the volume knob or slider gives you a variety of volume levels: “kind of soft,” 

285

Book IV

Your 
Technique 
and

“not very loud,” you name it. Rather than keep track of some more highly 
descriptive but long Italian words, you need only remember one abbreviation 
for the in-between volumes: m, which stands for mezzo (medium). Place this 
word before piano or forte, and you get two more shades of volume.
For extreme volumes like “very soft” and “insanely loud,” just throw a few more 
ps or fs together. The more you have, the more you play. That is, pp means 
“very soft.” The written word isn’t piano-piano, though. Instead, you use the 
Italian suffix -issimo, loosely translated as “very,” and you end up with pianis­
simo. The symbol ff would be “very loud,” or fortissimo.
Gather all these words, abbreviations, and suffixes together and you get the 
list of dynamic ranges shown in Table 1-1.

Making gradual shifts in volume
Two dynamic symbols that you encounter quite often are those that tell you 
to gradually play louder or gradually play softer. These symbols look like bird 
beaks. A bird gets louder as it opens its beak; softer as it closes its beak. So, 
with this marvelous Audubon analogy, check out Figure 1-2 and see if you can 
tell what the chicken scratchings mean.
	
Figure 1-2: 
Indications 
of gradual 
volume 
changes.
	

286
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
To gradually play louder is a crescendo; to gradually play softer is a diminuendo. 
Composers opposed to using the bird beak symbols in their music write out 
these Italian words or use the abbreviations cres. and dim.
Whether they appear as words, abbreviations, or symbols, these instructions 
are almost always preceded and followed by dynamic markings that tell you to 
play from volume A gradually to volume B. Maybe the composer wants you to 
gradually go from very soft (pp) to very loud (ff), or perhaps the music indicates 
a subtle change from mezzo piano (mp) to mezzo forte (mf). Whatever the 
case, it’s up to you to decide how to play these volume changes.
Sometimes the composer asks you to increase and then decrease the volume 
in sort of an up-and-down effect. Many musicians call this dynamic marking, 
shown in Figure 1-3, a hairpin because of how it looks.
	
Figure 1-3: 
Get loud, 
get soft, get 
dynamic.
	
To play more dynamics right now, skip to the “Dressing Up Your Songs” section 
at the end of the chapter and play “Polovtsian Dance.”
	
Why even bother with volume changes? Why not just play everything really 
loudly so everyone can hear? That approach works fairly well for some heavy 
metal guitar anthems, but with piano music the subtle degrees of volume 
show off your ability to convey emotion in your playing.
Articulate the Positive
Articulating when you play refers to the way you play each note. The various 
ways to play a note are called articulations, or attacks, which may imply a 
little more force than necessary, so the less-combative word is used here.
Interpreting articulation symbols
Articulations come in all shapes. Each is represented by a symbol that tells you 
how to play the note: accented, long, short, and so on. You can change the entire 
sound and style of a song by changing even just a few articulations. Table 1-2 
shows you the symbols that composers use to indicate the various articulations.

287
 Chapter 1: Adding Effects and Flair to Your Piano Playing
Book IV
Refining 
Your 
Technique 
and 
Exploring 
Styles
To add these articulations to music, the composer just places the appropriate 
symbol right underneath or right above the note.
In addition to the symbols in Table 1-2, which apply to only one note, composers 
use an articulation marking that applies to a group of notes. In music, a slur is 
a curved line over two or more notes of different pitches that indicates that 
the notes should be played legato, or connected in a smooth manner. Think 
of playing the notes within a slur as if they’re being sung by someone with a 
beautiful voice.
	
Be careful not to mistake a tie for a slur. A slur is applied to notes of different 
pitch and often groups many notes in a melodic phrase. A tie is also a curved 
line, but it connects one notehead to another notehead of the same pitch. 
Slurs start and end near the notehead or the stem, as shown in Figure 1-4, a bit 
of “O Sole Mio.”
	
Figure 1-4: 
Four slurs 
and three 
ties.
	

288
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
The power of articulation
If you play music without articulations, you can forget about pleasing your 
audience. Listening to music without articulations is like suffering through a 
speech given in a monotone voice. Boring.
To understand the importance of articulation, try playing a bit of the melody 
of “Camptown Races” using articulation markings (see Figure 1-5). Then play 
it again without the articulations — just ignore them. You should be able to 
tell that it has more verve and personality with articulations than without.
	
Figure 1-5: 
Giving a 
melody 
some indi-
vidual char-
acter with 
articulations.
	
	
If a piece of music doesn’t already have articulations, choose articulations that 
you think may fit the music and apply them. Pencil in your own articulations 
and see how the music sounds your way. It’s not like you’re changing the melody, 
just the style. Of course, following the composer’s articulations (when they 
exist) is always your best bet for achieving the sound and style the composer 
intended — if that’s your goal.
For a complete version of “Camptown Races” with more articulations right now, 
skip to the section “Dressing Up Your Songs” at the end of the chapter.
Control the Tempo
Just as you can shade your music with dynamics, you can make subtle variations 
to the tempo. The tempo marking at the beginning of a song tells you how fast to 
play the song. As a rule of thumb, your goal should always be to keep steady 
time without unintentionally slowing down or speeding up. But there are times 
when you do intend to slow down or speed up. Time in music is flexible in this 
way: You can change tempo very slightly or quite dramatically when the music 
calls for it.

289
 Chapter 1: Adding Effects and Flair to Your Piano Playing
Book IV
Refining 
Your 
Technique 
and 
Exploring 
Styles
Not surprisingly, musical words and symbols exist to tell you what to do and 
how much to do it. Of course the words are usually in Italian. Here are the 
three most important indications you need to know:
	
✓	Accelerando: When the composer wants you to put some speed on, you’ll 
see this word or its abbreviation, accel. It means accelerate!
	
✓	Ritardando: When the composer wants you to slow down, you’ll see this 
word or its abbreviation, rit.
	
✓	Fermata: The symbol 𝄐 stands for fermata. When you see it, pause or hold 
the note(s) under the fermata and stop counting time. There’s no rule 
governing how long you should hold a fermata — the composer intention­
ally leaves that to the performer’s discretion. A good starting point is to 
hold the note(s) under the fermata for twice as long as its written value.
Figure 1-6 shows the melody to “For He’s a Jolly Good Fellow,” which illustrates 
these tempo changes. In a typically playful rendition of the song, you naturally 
slow down and hold the highest note, and maybe speed up for the final phrase.
Figure 1-6: 
Playing 
around with 
tempo.
Pedal Power
Book I Chapter 5 talks about the pedals that come with acoustic and digital 
pianos. This section tells you a bit more about how to use these to assist the 
dynamics and articulations when you play, adding to the ways you can dress 
up your music.

290
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
Using the damper pedal
When piano players talk about using the pedal, they usually mean using the 
damper pedal, which is the one on the right as you sit at a piano. Because the 
damper pedal allows the notes to sustain after your fingers release the keys, 
it’s often called the sustain pedal.
There are a few different ways to indicate when to put the pedal down, when 
to lift it, and when to make a quick up-down pedal change. As Figure 1-7 shows, 
the abbreviation Ped. tells you when to put the pedal down. Keep the pedal 
down until the asterisk or the end bracket of the pedal line. A notch in the 
pedal line indicates a pedal change: Lift your foot enough to allow the pedal 
to clear, and then press the pedal down again.
	
Figure 1-7: 
Pedaling 
indications.
	
The best way to learn how to pedal is to just try it out as you play. Although 
all damper pedals have the same function, each instrument can have its own 
pedal personality, and just as you adjust to the accelerator and brake system 
of a car, you have to try out a damper pedal to get a good feel for it.
	
The most important thing about pedaling is simply not to overuse it. Things can 
get blurry in a hurry, and for the listener your song with too much pedal can 
become the aural equivalent of runny makeup. Listen carefully to the music as 
you play to hear it as others hear it.
At its most basic function, the damper pedal connects one melody note or 
chord to the next where there would be a break in the sound without using 
the pedal. Play Figure 1-8, and use the pedal to connect the first note of the 
melody to the second, and so on. Then play the excerpt again without the 
pedal. You’ll hear that the two-note phrases don’t sound nearly as smooth 
as the first version because you have to lift your hands to move to the next 
note, resulting in breaks between the notes within a slur.

Use the pedal to help your music sound smoother (legato), hold a note or a 
chord for a long time, or give your music a more resonant quality.
Hard facts on soft-pedaling
When the composer wants you to use the soft pedal, which is on the far left 
as you sit at the piano, you see the indication una corda. When you see the 
indication tre corda, you release the soft pedal.
You can use the soft pedal anytime you like, of course, to play quietly or to 
create a hushed atmosphere or an intimate feeling. Try it out on the lullaby 
“All Through the Night” in Figure 1-9.

two different functions.
	
✓	The sostenuto pedal: The traditional grand piano has a pedal that acts 
like a damper pedal for only the note or notes your fingers are playing when 
you press the pedal down. For example, you play a big bass note, put the 
middle pedal down, and then noodle some staccato upper-register filigree, 
with the bass note sounding throughout, thanks to the sostenuto pedal.
	
✓	The practice pedal: Many upright pianos have a practice pedal between 
the soft pedal and the damper pedal. This pedal mutes the strings, allowing 
you to hear what you play but softening the sound quite a bit. The practice 
pedal has a notch at the opening where you can lock the pedal into position 
with your foot as you play with the muted setting.
Touching on Grace Notes
The term grace note sounds pretty fancy, but grace notes are actually a very 
simple effect that can make your music sound more complex. A grace note is a 
note that you play just slightly before a real note. You might think of it as a graze 
note, because your finger just grazes the grace note before playing the real note.
Grace notes are written in different ways. Figure 1-10 shows the most common 
types of grace notes. A single grace note looks like a small eighth note with a 

293
 Chapter 1: Adding Effects and Flair to Your Piano Playing
Book IV
Refining 
Your 
Technique 
and 
Exploring 
Styles
slash through it. Think of the slash as meaning “cancel the rhythmic value.” 
Multiple grace notes look like small sixteenth notes. You play them very 
quickly, so it sounds like you’re rolling into the main note.
	
Figure 1-10: 
Amazing 
grace notes, 
how sweet 
the sound.	
	
You don’t always have to play grace notes super-fast. The character and effect 
of a grace note is determined by the tempo and style of the music. The idea is 
to use a grace note to give its main note a little lift.
	
To hear some grace notes in action, listen to Track 66 as you follow along with 
the music to the rousing classic “Pop! Goes the Weasel,” which is just bursting 
with grace notes (see Figure 1-11).
Figure 1-11: 
This weasel 
pops with 
the help of 
some grace 
notes.
Grace notes are a common feature of blues, jazz, country, and classical piano 
music styles. Heck, you can use grace notes anywhere you like. The best 
grace notes are those that are a half step or whole step away from the full 
melodic note, but feel free to try ones that are even farther apart. Beginning a 
song’s melody with a grace note is an excellent idea, especially if the song is 
in the jazz or blues style.

Just Trillin’
If you’ve ever heard the sound of a piccolo twittering high above the band in 
a John Phillip Sousa march, you’ve heard the effect of a trill. What sounds like 
a very elaborate trick for the piccolo player is actually a very simple procedure 
of alternating between two notes in rapid succession. The same holds true for 
trills in piano music.
What does a trill sound like? (You mean the piccolo metaphor isn’t good 
enough for you?) A trill sounds like a bunch of 32nd or 64th notes, as shown 
in Figure 1-12. Trills add a certain classical finesse to your playing style.
	
Figure 1-12: 
What a trill 
sounds like.
	
To save the time and ink required to write all those darn beams, composers use a 
shorthand symbol for trills: They write a tr above the trilled note. You know — tr 
as in the first two letters of trill. Sometimes music isn’t so complicated.
Generally speaking, a note is trilled upward to the note a whole step above 
the main note. However, sometimes a composer wants a downward trill or 
even a half-step trill, and writes the specific note to be used in the trill in one 
of several ways (see Figure 1-13).
	
Figure 1-13: 
Simon says, 
“Trill this 
note.”
	
In addition to the tr abbreviation, the composer can write a sharp or flat sign, 
which tells you to trill to the note’s sharp or to the note’s flat. Another way of 
notating the trill is to write the specific trilled note as a small, stemless notehead 
in parentheses next to the original note.
To play some trills yourself, skip to the section “Dressing Up Your Songs” at 
the end of this chapter and play “Trumpet Voluntary.”

295
 Chapter 1: Adding Effects and Flair to Your Piano Playing
Book IV
Refining 
Your 
Technique 
and 
Exploring 
Styles
	
Don’t wait for the composer to give you permission to trill — add trills yourself. 
Find a note you think would sound good played as a trill and write tr above it. 
Half notes and whole notes are usually the best ones to trill because they’re 
long enough to allow you time to get those fingers fluttering. Experiment with 
half-step and whole-step trills in different directions.
Don’t Miss the Gliss
A glissando (also known as a gliss in this lazy music industry) is a fast slide 
across several keys on the keyboard. There’s nothing quite like starting and 
ending a song with this effect. It will dazzle any audience.
To try a right-hand gliss, put your thumb on a high C note and drag your 
thumbnail down across the keys very quickly all the way to the bottom of the 
keyboard. Cool, huh?
Figure 1-14 shows you how composers notate this effect, which is generally 
with a wavy line and the abbreviation gliss going from the starting note in the 
direction of the gliss. For example, if you see a wavy line going up from C, play 
the note C and slide up the keyboard. Sometimes the specific ending note is 
shown at the other end of the wavy line; other times, it’s up to you to decide 
where to stop.
	
Figure 1-14: 
Gliss me, 
gliss me, 
now you 
gotta 
kiss me.
	
	
Sometimes the composer specifies both the beginning and ending notes of the 
gliss — for that, just practice, practice, practice. Starting on a specific note is 
easy, but stopping on the right note is like trying to stop a car on a dime. 
Sometimes you can use your other hand to play the final note if it’s not busy 
playing something else.
Depending on the direction of the gliss and the hand you use, different fingers do 
the job. Figure 1-15 shows you the correct hand positions for each glissando:
	
✓	Downward with right hand: Gliss with the nail of your thumb (RH 1), as 
shown in Figure 1-15a.
	
✓	Upward with right hand: Gliss with the nail of your middle finger (RH 3) 
and perhaps a little help from RH 4, as shown in Figure 1-15b.

296
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
	
✓	Downward with left hand: Gliss with the nail of your middle finger 
(LH 3) and perhaps a little help from LH 4, as shown in Figure 1-15c.
	
✓	Upward with left hand: Gliss with the nail of your thumb (LH 1), as 
shown in Figure 1-15d.
	
After raking your fingers across the keys several times, your fingers may start 
hurting. If so, you’re using the wrong part of your finger to gliss; when done 
properly, a glissando shouldn’t hurt. Make sure you’re using your fingernail, 
and above all, don’t play a gliss with your fingertips. Not only can this cause a 
blister, but the squeaking sound is worse than nails on a chalkboard.
Try playing a downward and an upward gliss in Figure 1-16, a Jerry Lee Lewis-
inspired number. The effect of a glissando is altogether powerful, energetic, 
and just plain rocking.

Trembling Tremolos
As mentioned, a trill occurs when you flutter your fingers very quickly between 
two notes that are close together, either a half step or whole step apart. So, 
what do you call fluttering between two notes that are farther apart? You can 
call it whatever you want, but the music world calls it a tremolo.
To play a tremolo, pick an interval — anything larger than a whole step — and 
alternate playing the two notes as quickly as possible. Like a trill, a tremolo 
sounds as if you’re playing a bunch of 32nd or 64th notes. But unlike the 
notation for a trill, which just puts tr above one note, the notation for a tremolo 
actually shows you both notes that your fingers rumble between.
In Figure 1-17, you see that the two notes of a tremolo have the same note 
length. At first glance, this notation looks like there are too many beats in 

298
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
each measure, but the three diagonal lines between the notes signal that 
this is a tremolo and therefore the two notes share the note length. You only 
count the beats of the first note.
	
Figure 1-17: 
Tremolo 
notation.
	
You can also play tremolo chords. All you do is break the chord into two parts: 
a bottom note and the remaining top notes. Shake the chord into a tremolo by 
alternating between the two parts as quickly as possible. Tremolo chords may 
look intimidating, but if you can play the chord, you can play the tremolo.
Figure 1-18 gives you a chance to play a few tremolo chords. For the first mea­
sure, put your hand in position for a G major chord and rock between the top 
notes (B and D) and the bottom note (G) very quickly. Move to the next measure 
and do the same with a second inversion C chord, and so on.
Working under the hood
In the 20th century, many composers and pia­
nists became bored with the normal sounds of a 
piano. No longer satisfied by the effects of trills, 
glissandi, and tremolos, these brave (and mis­
understood) pioneers started tinkering around 
under the piano lid.
Try it yourself. Open your piano lid and pluck 
the strings with your fingernail. Now try a gliss 
across all the strings while holding down the 
sustain pedal. The sound is mysterious and a 
bit creepy.
Composers like Henry Cowell and John Cage 
didn’t stop there. Oh, no. They began writing 
pieces that incorporated these sounds, asking 
the player to pluck certain notes on the inside 
of the piano. And you think playing the black 
and white keys is hard! Pushing the limits even 
further, a phenomenon called prepared piano 
became quite popular (and still is) with modern 
composers. A myriad of new sounds were 
created by inserting various objects between the 
piano strings — screws, yarn, pillows, and so on.
Hardware between the strings can damage 
your expensive piano. If you really want to 
experience these sounds the right way, check 
out the following recordings:
	✓	The Banshee, Henry Cowell: Among other 
things, you hear strumming or plucking of 
the piano strings.
	✓	Airplane Sonata, George Antheil: A number 
of strange piano effects are evident in this 
eclectic piece.
	✓	Tabula rasa, Arvo Pärt: The piano is pre­
pared with screws between the strings.
	✓	The Firm Soundtrack, Dave Grusin: This 
piece uses all types of things on the piano, 
including a violin bow playing across the 
strings.

Dressing Up Your Songs
	
This section lets you cut loose with the dynamics, articulations, ornamentations, 
and other fancy techniques that let you dress up your music. For each song, a 
few tips and the techniques used are noted. Let ’er rip!
	
✓	“Polovtsian Dance” (Track 67): This haunting melody by Alexander 
Borodin is perfect for adding some dynamic shading. Follow the volume 
indications and hairpins and get as much as you can out of the pianos 
and fortes.
	
✓	“Camptown Races” (Track 68): Go hog-wild with the articulation mark­
ings on this song. Define each and every staccato, tenuto, and accent to 
give the song a strong shape.
	
✓	“Trumpet Voluntary” (Track 69): Listen to Jeremiah Clarke’s famous 
“Trumpet Voluntary” on Track 64 to get an idea of how it should sound. 
Then try it yourself. Each trill starts on the note D, played with RH 2, and 
trills upward to E (the next highest scale tone), played with RH 3. Alternate 
very rapidly between these two notes while counting the number of beats 
required for the trill, a dotted quarter note. The squiggly line following the 
tr tells you how long to keep trillin’.
	
✓	“Also Sprach Zarathustra” (Track 70): Tremolos of any size sound great 
played by either hand. Probably the most popular left-hand tremolo 
is the octave tremolo. Stretch your hand over a C octave and let this 
interval rumble in a familiar melody. You may recognize this piece as the 
theme to the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.
	
✓	“Quiet Sunset” (Track 71): Follow the damper pedal indications when 
you play this piece to create smooth connections between melody notes 
and between successive chords. Practice pedaling from one note to the 
next during the melodic phrases and from one chord to the next during 
the chordal phrases, and listen for smooth, unbroken lines.

ant to make even a simple song like “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” into 
a showstopper? This is the chapter for you. This chapter helps you 
apply a handful of tricks and techniques to just about any song you encounter 
in your piano career. Whether it’s an attention-grabbing intro or finale, a cool 
accompaniment pattern, or just a nice little riff thrown in, the tricks in this 
chapter help you to spice up your music.
Great Left-Hand Accompaniment 
Patterns
One of the most important tools for your bag of tricks is a good supply of 
­left-hand accompaniment patterns. Any time you’re faced with playing 
straight chords or even playing melodies from a fake book (which pretty 
much just gives the chord names), you’re left to your own resources to 
supply an interesting-sounding bass line.
Fret not. Look no further. Put away the antacid tablets. This section gives you 
excellent and professional-sounding left-hand patterns that you can apply to 
just about any song you come across. Each of these patterns is versatile and 
user-friendly. This section shows you when you can apply the pattern to a 
3/4 as well as a 4/4 meter.

306
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
	
It’s important to practice these patterns again and again to master the right 
notes and the way each pattern feels under your fingers. After a while, though, 
you can ignore the printed music and just try to feel the pattern: the distance 
between the intervals, the shape of the chord, the rhythm, and so on. The more 
comfortable you are with the pattern, the more easily you can apply it to any 
key, any chord, and any scale.
Fixed and broken chords
The easiest left-hand accompaniment is chords, whether you play them as 
straight chords or arpeggios. Start with the basic chords and find inversions 
that work well for you without requiring your left hand to move all over the 
keyboard. (Turn to Book III Chapter 6 for more on chords, arpeggios, and 
inversions.) Also, you should experiment with various rhythmic patterns. For 
example, try playing quarter-note chords instead of whole-note chords. Or 
try a dotted quarter and eighth-note pattern.
	
In Figure 2-1 (Track 72) the left hand plays a simple chord progression with 
several different rhythmic patterns. Play these a few times and decide which 
rhythmic pattern works, sounds, and feels best to you.

You can change the texture and add some variety with a constant arpeggiated 
pattern in the left hand. For every chord symbol in Figure 2-2 (Track 73), use 
the root, fifth, and octave notes of the chord’s scale to form an up-and-down 
pattern throughout the song. This pattern works for fast or slow songs.
Figure 2-2: 
Root-fifth-
octave 
patterns are 
easy to play 
and sound 
great.

308
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
To play a song using the left-hand accompaniment in Figure 2-2 right now, 
skip to the end of the chapter and play “Love Me Like You Used To.”
Chord picking
Left-hand chord picking is a style well suited to country music. But even if you 
aren’t a fan of that genre, you can apply this pattern to just about any song 
you like.
Most chords are made up of a root note, a third interval, and a fifth interval. 
You need to know these three elements to be a successful chord-picker.
To play this pattern, break a chord into two units: the root note and two 
top notes. Play the root note on beat 1 and the top two notes together 
on beat 2. To make it sound even more impressive, do something a little 
­different on beat 3: Play the fifth of the chord by itself but one octave 
Lower.
	
Now try playing this pattern in the piece “Picking and Grinning” (see 
Figure 2-3, Track 74). After you get the feel of this bouncy rhythmic pattern, 
you won’t even need to look at your hands. Your pinky will find the two 
alternating bass notes because they’re always the same distance from 
the root.
Octave hammering
This easy (if tiring) left-handed groove is really fun and easy if your right 
hand is just playing chords. But if you’re playing a melody or something more 
complicated than chords with your right hand, this pattern may not be a 
practical choice.

309
 Chapter 2: Getting into the Groove
Book IV
Refining 
Your 
Technique 
and 
Exploring 
Styles
To hammer out some octaves, you simply prepare your left hand in an open 
octave position, with your pinky and thumb ready on the two notes, and make 
sure your wrist is loose enough to bounce a bit with the appropriate rhythm. 
When the chord changes, keep your hand in octave position as you move 
directly to the next set of octaves. You can play the octaves using any rhythm 
that sounds good to you — try whole notes, half notes, even eighth notes, 
depending on the rhythmic character of the song.

“Picking 
and

310
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
	
“Octaves in the Left” (see Figure 2-4, Track 75) lets you roll out some octaves.
	
Figure 2-4: 
Hammer out 
octaves in 
“Octaves in 
the Left.”
	
	
As you become more familiar with harmony, you can add to these left-hand 
octave patterns with octaves built on the notes of the chord. For example, the 
octaves in “Jumping Octaves” (see Figure 2-5, Track 76) move from the root 
note to the third interval note to the fifth interval note for each right-hand 
chord.
Bouncy rock patterns
In addition to slamming octaves, a nice rock and roll-sounding bass pattern 
may use other intervals drawn from scale notes.

311

You can create a great bass pattern using the octave, the fifth, and the sixth 
intervals of each chord. Try this rockin’ accompaniment along with “Rockin’ 
Intervals” (see Figure 2-6, Track 77). You can modify the pattern to fit a two- or 
one-measure pattern in 4/4 meter. After a few times through, your hands will 
know what to do, and you can apply the pattern to any major chord.

The great Chuck Berry made the locomotive-sounding pattern demonstrated 
in “Berry-Style Blues” (see Figure 2-7, Track 78) very popular on the guitar. It 
was only a matter of time before some trail-blazing pianist adapted this guitar 
pattern to the piano. All you have to do is alternate between playing an open 
fifth and an open sixth on every beat.

Melodic bass lines
	
Some left-hand patterns are so widely used that they’re better known than the 
melodies they accompany. “Bum-ba-di-da” (see Figure 2-8, Track 79) is one 
such pattern that was made famous by Roy Rogers in his show-closing song, 
“Happy Trails.” All you need are three notes from each chord’s scale: the root, 
the fifth, and the sixth. Play them back and forth, over and over.

pattern.
	
To play a song with the bum-ba-di-da bass line right now, jump to the later 
section “Playing Songs with Left-Hand Grooves” and play “Country Riffin’.”
Another melodic left-hand pattern played by every pianist from novice to pro 
is the “boogie-woogie” bass line. It doesn’t even need a melody. This bass line 
uses notes from a major scale but lowers the seventh note of the scale a half 
step (also called a flatted seventh) to give you that bluesy sound.
	
For each new chord in the boogie-woogie bass line (see Figure 2-9, Track 80), 
you play the following scale notes up the keys and then back down: root, third, 
fifth, sixth, flatted seventh.

Applying Great Intros and Finales
A good pianist should always be able to begin and end a piece in an interesting 
way. You can join the ranks of good pianists by filing away some stock intros 
and finales (sometimes called outros) you can apply to any piece of music at 
any given time. An intro or finale is your time to shine, so milk it for all it’s 
worth.
Few things are more fun than playing a great intro or finale. Heck, some of 
them sound great alone, without a song attached.

316
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
	
Most of the intros and finales in this section are geared toward popular music. 
When it comes to classical music, the composer usually gives you an appropri­
ate beginning and ending. Of course, if you really want to fire up Chopin’s 
Minute Waltz, you can always add one of these intros.
You can add the intros and finales in this section to virtually any piece of 
music. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Check the song’s style.
	
	 Each intro and finale has a different style or sound. Consider the style 
of the song you’re playing and choose an intro that works best with it. 
For example, a rock and roll intro may not sound very good attached to 
a soft country ballad. But, then again, anything’s possible in music.
	
2.	Check the song’s key.
	
	 All the intros and finales you find in this book are written in the key of 
C. If the song you want to play is also in the key of C, you’re ready to go. 
If not, adjust the notes and chords of the intro and finale you choose to 
correspond with the song’s key by using the helpful hints shown with 
each intro and finale.
	
3.	Check the song’s first chord.
	
	 All the intros I show you transition easily into the first chords or notes 
of a song, provided that the song begins with a chord built on the first 
tone of the scale. (Book III Chapter 6 explains these types of chords.) 
For example, if the song you’re playing is in the key of C and begins 
with a C major chord, any of the intros here work perfectly because 
they’re written in the key of C. If your song starts with a different chord, 
use the hints provided with each intro to adjust the chord accordingly.
	
4.	Check the song’s last chord.
	
	 Like intros, you can tack the finales onto the end of a song if the 
song ends with a chord built on the first tone of the scale (and most 
songs do). For example, if the song you’re playing is in the key of C and 
ends with a C major chord, you’ll have no problem with one of these 
finales because they’re written in the key of C. If your song ends with a 
different chord, you need to adjust the finale to the appropriate key.
	
Adjusting the intros and finales into different keys involves a lot of transposing 
work. If you’re just starting out with the piano, only apply these intros and 
finales to songs in the key of C. (This book includes many such songs.) When 
you’re ready to apply an intro or finale to a song of a different key, check out 
which note of the scale it starts on and try to match the interval patterns in 
the new key.

The big entrance
When the singer needs a good intro, who’s going to play it? The drummer? 
Probably not. You are. And it can’t be any old intro — it’s gotta be good. The 
audience has a tendency to talk between songs, so it’s your job to shut ’em up 
and announce the start of the new song. Playing a few bars of show-­stopping, 
original material really gets things hopping and leaves them begging for more.
The “Get Ready, Here We Go” intro
	
The intro in Figure 2-10 (Track 81) is bound to grab the audience’s attention. It 
has been used in just about every style of music, from vaudeville to ragtime to 
Broadway. Hear it once and you’ll never forget it. Play it and you’ll be hooked. 
Just keep repeating the measures between the repeat signs, or vamp, until 
you’re ready to start the melody. (Book II Chapter 4 talks about repeat signs 
and what they do.)
	
Figure 2-10: 
Intro #1.
	
The “Rockin’ Jam” intro
	
You can knock some socks off with a rock and roll intro like the one in 
Figure 2-11 (Track 82). The triplets are tricky, but you can play this one fast or 
slow. A slower-tempo version works well with a blues song, and a fast version 
is good for . . . well, a fast rockin’ song. This intro also contains grace notes, 
which you can read about in Book IV Chapter 1.
The “Sweet Ballad” intro
	
When a slow ballad is next on the set list, the intro in Figure 2-12 (Track 83) 
works well. The left-hand part sets up a root-fifth-octave pattern introduced in 
the earlier section “Fixed and broken chords.” The right-hand part makes use 
of parallel sixths, moving sweetly down the scale.

The “Killing Time” intro
	
Sometimes you need to repeat an intro over and over. Perhaps you’ve forgotten 
the melody. Perhaps you’re waiting for divine inspiration. Or maybe you’re 
waiting for the singer to decide to join you. Whatever the case, you can easily 
repeat an intro like the one in Figure 2-13 (Track 84) until the time comes to 
move on. Simply play the first four measures over and over until you’re finally 
ready. You’re simply vamping on a G7 chord, which leads you (and the preoc­
cupied singer) into the key of C when you’re both ready.

The “Saloon Salutations” intro
	
When you’re just tinkering around in a piano lounge, perhaps all you need is a 
few bars of honky-tonk style piano, like the ones in Figure 2-14 (Track 85). 
Notice how effective the grace notes (measure 1) and tremolos (measure 2) 
are in this intro.

Exit, stage left
The band is building up to the final chord, and it’s time for the big finish. The 
singer belts the last lyric, and it’s up to you to drop the curtain. Quick! Grab a 
handful of these finales and you’re sure to receive an encore request.
The “I Loved You, You Left Me” finale
	
The finale shown in Figure 2-15 (Track 86) is a simple but effective ending, 
­perhaps even a tear-jerker when played with the right emotion. You certainly 
wouldn’t want to use this as an end to a rocking song like “Burning Down the 
House,” but it fits nicely with any major-key ballad (like the one you ­introduced 
with Intro #3 in Figure 2-13).
Figure 2-15: 
Finale #1.
The “Let’s Load Up the Bus” finale
	
After a classic rock jam, something like the finale in Figure 2-16 (Track 87) 
finishes the song with the appropriate amount of flair. The triplets take you 
down the C blues scale. They should be played as smoothly as possible, so 
feel free to slow down the tempo until you conquer the correct fingering. 
And make sure to really punch that last chord!

The “Last Call” finale
	
The triplets in the finale of Figure 2-17 (Track 88) give this closer a distinctive 
feel that works best with a blues or jazz piece. It has the sound of winding 
down to a halt.
	
In this finale, you play the notes of chords C, C diminished, Dm7, and C again. 
You can easily transpose and attach this finale to a song in any key by applying 
the correct chord types and breaking them up. For example, in the key of G, 
the chords are G, G diminished, Am7, and G.
	
Figure 2-17: 
Finale #3.
	
The “Shave and a Haircut” finale
	
Everyone knows it. Everyone loves it. Very few know how to notate it. How 
could this section possibly not include the ever-famous “Shave and a Haircut” 
closer? Figure 2-18 (Track 89) shows you this all-time classic in all its glory. 
You can play this finale with unison octaves, so the name of each scale note is 
placed in the middle of the grand staff. With this information, you can buy a 
shave and a haircut in the key of your choice.

Playing Songs with Left-Hand Grooves
	
The songs in this section put together the techniques introduced in this 
chapter: left-hand accompaniment patterns and intros and finales. You can 
enjoy the songs on their own and also use them as examples of how to apply 
these tools to your own songs.
	
✓	“Country Riffin’” (Track 90): This little ditty is easy on the fingers but 
even easier on the ears. The bum-ba-di-da bass line sets the groove and 
the “Last Call” finale brings the song home. With a sauntering feel that 
will lighten the mood, it’s sure to be a crowd pleaser.
	
✓	“Love Me Like You Used To” (Track 91): This song combines a left-hand 
accompaniment pattern from earlier in this chapter with an intro and 
finale. The left-hand part sets the root-fifth-octave arpeggiated pattern to 
a slow-tempo groove that supports the entire song.

T

his chapter is a brief introduction to the classical style, an important one 
for players of piano and keyboard. For a complete treatment on the topic, 
check out the oldie but goodie, Classical Music For Dummies by David Pogue 
and Scott Speck (Wiley, 1997).
Many people think of classical music as old, intellectual, sometimes boring 
music written by a bunch of dead guys who wore wigs. This may be true 
(except for the “boring” part), but the sound and feel of classical music is 
unique. You, too, can apply the sound and feel of classical music to your 
songs, even ones written in this century.
Figure 3-1 is an excerpt from a classical piano piece by Mozart called Sonata 
in C. Notice the use of arpeggios in the left hand and the trills scattered 
throughout in the right hand. Then, after introducing the cute little melody, 
what does he give you? Scales!
	
Composers like Liszt and Grieg wrote some very dramatic and loud piano 
music. For example, the opening bars of Grieg’s monumental Piano Concerto 
begin with loud, descending octaves, as shown in Figure 3-2.

But classical composers could also do soft and sweet, and one way they 
sweetened their sound was by rolling their chords. Liszt, for example, loved 
to end his odes with a beautiful, soft chord, rolled gently from the bottom 
note up to the top. The squiggly line next to the chords in Figure 3-3 gets you 
ready to roll.

Counterpoint as a Classical Revelation
During the Golden Age of classical music, from the late 1700s to the mid-
1800s, composers were competing viciously with one another to create new 
and more vibrant types of music. With the adoption of the piano by classical 
artists, existing ways of playing music could be further developed, including 
counterpoint, which uses both hands to create melody and harmony.
Composers of the period began writing music for the left hand that was just 
as complicated as the music written for the right. The left-hand music they 
created often mirrored closely what the right hand had been playing.
Prior to the Classical period, the bass line in most music was limited to simple 
melodic accompaniment. This limited use of the bass line was a carryover 
from the music of the Catholic Church, where the organ provided simple bass 
lines (figured bass) to accompany vocalists.
The invention of counterpoint not only enhanced the melody of musical arrange­
ments, but it also blurred exactly where the melody ended and the harmony 
began. Almost every classical composer, using all the forms discussed in this 
chapter, has used counterpoint in his or her own music — even the right-handed 
ones. Figure 3-4 shows an example of counterpoint.

Sussing Out the Sonata
The sonata was the most popular form used by instrumental composers from 
the mid-18th century until the beginning of the 20th century. This form is con­
sidered by many to be the first true break from the liturgical music that had 
made such an impact on Western music from the Medieval period on through 
the Baroque period.
Sonatas are based on the song (ternary) form, ABA, which means they have 
three defined parts: exposition, development, and recapitulation. (For more on 
common forms, check out Book III Chapter 4.) The true genius of the sonata is 
that not only does its structure allow many of the rules of basic music theory 
to be broken, but it also encourages such defiance. With a sonata, it’s perfectly 
allowable to switch to a new key and time signature in the middle of the song. 
The following sections explain the three parts of a sonata.
Starting with the exposition
The first part of a sonata, called the exposition, presents the basic thematic 
material of the movement, or each self-contained part of a piece of music. 
This part is also often broken up into two thematic parts:
	
✓	First part: Generally, the first part of the exposition presents the main 
theme of the song, or the musical “thread” that ties the piece together. 
This first part usually is the line that sticks the most in your head.
	
✓	Second part: The second part of the exposition is a “reflection” of the 
first part, in that it sounds a lot like the first part but is slightly changed.

Put on Beethoven’s Sonata in C Minor, Opus 13 to get a good example of these 
two defined parts, or look at the excerpts shown in Figures 3-5 and 3-6 from 
the same sonata.

which is a

theme of the 
first.	
Moving on to something new: Development
The second part of the sonata form, called the development, often sounds 
like it belongs to a completely different piece of music altogether. This part 
can move through different key signatures and explore musical ideas that are 
completely different from the original theme.

330
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
Often this part of the sonata is the most exciting. Here you’ll find big chords 
and increased tension with the use of stronger rhythm and greater interval 
content (number of interval steps between each note).
Figure 3-7 shows an excerpt from the development of Sonata in C Minor, 
Opus 13.

ment, of

Taking a rest with recapitulation
After the excitement of a sonata’s development, it feels natural to come to rest 
where you began. The third and final part of a sonata is the recapitulation, where 
the composition returns to the original key and the musical theme expressed 
in the first section and brings it all to a close. Figure 3-8 shows an excerpt of the 
final movement of Beethoven’s Sonata No. 8 in C Minor, Opus 13.

Rounding Up the Rondo
Rondos expand on the freedom of expression inherent in the sonata form by 
allowing even more disparate sections of music to be joined together by a 
common musical section. The formula for a rondo is ABACA. Technically, with 
a rondo you can indefinitely continue adding brand new sections — featuring 
different keys or time signatures — to a particular piece so long as you keep 
linking them together with the opening (A) theme. The A section of Mozart’s 
Rondo Alla Turca ties more than six different musical ideas together using 
this form. See Figure 3-9 for an excerpt.

section of

Turca.
Figuring Out the Fugue
Another major musical form to come out of the Classical period was the 
fugue, the form fully developed by Bach in the Baroque era. A fugue is a 
highly evolved form of imitative counterpoint, in which two (or more) musi­
cal lines use the same theme, either at the same pitch or transposed. Fugues 
are defined by the way the notes in the treble clef and the notes in the bass 
clef switch off carrying the main theme and driving the rhythm of the piece, 
resulting in a call-and-response feel.
Note, for example, in Figure 3-10 how the eighth notes and sixteenth notes 
appear first in one clef and then in the other, making both clefs alternately 
responsible for carrying the harmony (eighth notes) and melody (sixteenth 
notes) of the music.

Combining Forms into a Symphony
Literally, a symphony is a harmonious melding of elements. In music, a sym­
phony is a piece of music that combines several different musical forms and 
is usually performed by an orchestra.
Traditionally, a symphony consists of four movements (self-contained sec­
tions inside a single musical piece):
	
✓	Sonata allegro, or fast sonata
	
✓	Slow movement (free choice)
	
✓	Minuet (a short, stately piece of dance music set in 3/4 time)
	
✓	Combination of sonata and rondo

334
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
	
The idea of a symphony is that it combines a multitude of musical forms har­
moniously, so the aforementioned pattern is absolutely not set in stone.
The symphony form leaves the field for musical experimentation wide open. 
Some pieces that have come from this form are the most enduring and 
recognizable classical music pieces ever recorded. The most famous one, 
of course, is Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 (Opus 67), whose opening line, 
“Bu-bu-bu-BUM,” is possibly the most universally known opening theme of 
any type of music. Figure 3-11 shows you the music for this legendary theme.
	
Figure 3-11: 
Bu-bu-bu-
BUM. . . .
	
Observing Other Classical Forms
Other classical forms are also enduring and important, if slightly less popular. 
They’re more determined by how many performers are involved in the per­
formance than the official structure of the music performed or the role of the 
performers themselves.
Concerto
A concerto is a composition written for a solo instrument backed by an 
orchestra. The concerto often creates superstars of classical music, such as 
pianist Lang Lang and violinist Itzhak Perlman. The soloists often carry as 
much weight as the long-dead composers themselves do.

Duet
Anybody who’s ever sat through a piano lesson has probably played a duet, 
which is a piece of music written for two people. A duet generally consists of 
two pianists or a pianist and a vocalist. When other instrumentation is used, 
such as a bass and a violin, or some other combination, the term duo is most 
commonly applied.
Piano duets are most often used as teaching devices, with the student han­
dling the basic melody line and the more advanced pianist handling the 
trickier accompaniment.
Etude
An etude is a brief musical composition based on a particular technical 
aspect of music, such as building scales, designed to help instruct the 
performer through musical exercise.
Fantasia
Fantasias are freeform and try to convey the impression of being completely 
improvised and divinely inspired, and are most often written for a solo instru­
ment or a small ensemble. The modern equivalent of the fantasia is free jazz.

iscussing form when talking about popular music is tricky because the 
term is often misused. Think of form as being the specific way a piece of 
music is constructed, with governing rules to that type of music’s construc­
tion (such as the classical forms discussed in Book IV Chapter 3). Genre, on 
the other hand, refers to a song’s style, such as the instrumentation used, 
overall tone of the music, and so on.
However, some popular modern genres of music have been around long 
enough that specific patterns can be seen in their overall construction. 
These genres are the blues, rock/pop/folk, country, jazz, and soul.
Feeling the Blues
The blues is the first truly American folk music (aside from the unique music 
that the Native Americans had before the European invasion). The structure 
of the blues is the common ancestor of pretty much all other constructions of 
American popular music and has been influential around the world. Around 
the turn of the 20th century, field holler, church music, and African percus­
sion had all melded into what is now known as the blues. By 1910, the word 
blues to describe this music was in widespread use.

338
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
Blues music uses song, or ternary, form in three parts that follows an AABA 
pattern of I, IV, and V chords in a given scale. (You can read about song form 
in Book III Chapter 4.) The B section is the bridge, a contrasting section that 
prepares the listener or performer for the return of the original A section. 
(Plenty of people complain that rock music only uses three chords: the I, IV, 
and V chords. Well, that all started with the blues!)
	
The blues is almost always played in 4/4 time, with the rhythm beat out either 
in regular quarter notes or in eighth notes and with strong accents given on 
both the first and third beats of each measure.
The most common types of blues songs are the 12-bar blues, the 8-bar blues, 
the 16-bar blues, the 24-bar blues, and the 32-bar blues. The “bar” refers to 
how many measures are used in each style of blues (see Book II Chapter 3 
for more about measures).
12-bar blues
The name is pretty self-explanatory: In 12-bar blues, you have 12 bars, or mea­
sures, of music to work with. In each verse of the 12-bar blues (you can have 
as many verses as you want, but usually a 12-bar blues composition has three 
or four), the third 4-bar segment works to resolve the previous 4 bars. The 
resolution, or conclusion, to the I7 chord at the end of the verse may signal 
the end of the song. Or, if the 12th bar is a V7 chord, the resolution to the 
I7 chord signals that you go back to the beginning of the song to repeat the 
progression for another verse. If the song continues on to a new verse, the 
V7 chord at the end of the song is called the turnaround.
The most commonly used pattern — from left to right, starting at the top and 
working down — for the 12-bar blues looks like this:
I7
I7
I7
I7
IV7
IV7
I7
I7
V7
IV7
I7
V7/I7 (turnaround)
So if you were playing a 12-bar blues song in the key of C, you would play it 
like this:
C7
C7
C7
C7
F7
F7
C7
C7
G7
F7
C7
G7/C7 (turnaround)

If you can hit those chords in that order, you have the bare bones for Muddy 
Waters’s classic “You Can’t Lose What You Ain’t Never Had.” Change the tonic 
(I) chord to an A (AAAA DDAA EDAE/A), and you have Robert Johnson’s 
“Crossroads Blues.”
You don’t always have to use the seventh chords, but it sounds more bluesy 
when you do.
If you’re playing the 12-bar blues in a minor key, here’s the common pattern 
to use (here rendered without the sevenths):
i
iv
i
i

iv
i
i

Count Basie’s famous and much-loved variation on the 12-bar blues took 
­elements of both the major and minor keys, as shown here:
I
IV
I

VI
ii
V

8-bar blues
8-bar blues is similar to 12-bar blues — it just has shorter verses in it and a 
slightly different common use of chord progressions. Here’s the standard 
pattern used for 8-bar blues:
I
IV
I
VI
ii
V
I
V/I (turnaround)
16-bar blues
Another variation on the basic 12-bar blues is the 16-bar blues. Where the 
8-bar blues is four bars shorter than the 12-bar blues, the 16-bar blues, as 
you can probably guess, is that much longer.

340
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
The 16-bar blues uses the same basic chord pattern structure as the 12-bar 
blues, with the 9th and 10th measures stated twice, like so:
I
I
I
I
IV
IV
I
I
V
IV
V
IV

24-bar blues
The 24-bar blues progression is similar to a 12-bar traditional blues progres­
sion except that each chord progression is doubled in duration, like so:
I
I
I
I

32-bar blues ballads and country
The 32-bar blues pattern is where you see the true roots of rock and jazz 
music. This extended version of the 12-bar blues pattern has the AABA struc­
ture, also called song form, that was adopted by rock bands in the 1960s. The 
pattern is also referred to as the SRDC Model: Statement (A1), Restatement 
(A2), Departure (B), and Conclusion (A3).
A typical 32-bar blues layout can look something like this:

When it was first created, 32-bar blues wasn’t nearly as popular with “true” 
blues performers as the 12-bar structure was, partly because it didn’t work 
as well with the short call-and-response form of lyricism that earmarked 
the blues. It did work well for the country music genre, though, and Hank 
Williams (Sr.) used this construction in songs like “Your Cheating Heart” and 
“I’m So Lonesome (I Could Cry).” Freddy Fender used this structure in his 
hits “Wasted Days and Wasted Nights” and “Before the Next Teardrop Falls.”
However, when this particular blues structure was picked up by people like 
Irving Berlin and George Gershwin, a lot — perhaps all — of the true heart 
of blues disappeared from the resulting music. The 32-bar blues transitioned 
into popular songs like “Frosty the Snowman” and “I Got Rhythm.”
The 32-bar blues also was significantly altered by the intervention of other 
classically trained composers, who mixed the ideas of the sonata and the 
rondo (see Book IV Chapter 3) with the traditional American blues. The 
result was the eventual creation of non-bluesy-sounding songs that used 
such aspects of classical music as the ability to change keys during the 
bridge section of a song.
Playing the blues
The blues even has its own scale, remember (which you can read about in 
Book III Chapter 2). In this section, you don’t apply the blues style to an exist­
ing song, but rather create your own blues from scratch. That’s right: You get 
to be a composer.
You can play fast blues, slow blues, happy blues, and sad blues. Whether 
your dog left you or your woman (or man) has done you wrong, playing the 
blues is as easy as counting to 12.
Two important elements in blues music are form and rhythm. When you 
have these down, add a few more essential musicalities, like grace notes or 
tremolos. Then you can make any of your songs sing the blues.
To play the blues, you use the following elements:
	
✓	12-bar form (there are others, as mentioned earlier)
	
✓	Swing or shuffle rhythm
	
✓	Seventh chords
	
✓	Tremolos
	
✓	Sad story to tell (everybody’s got one)

342
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
12-bar ditties
Most blues music utilizes a widely recognized form called 12-bar form, aptly 
named because each musical phrase of the song is 12 bars (measures) long. 
The 12-bar blues has a chord sequence that repeats over and over, usually 
with different lyrics and perhaps some melodic variation, until you genuinely 
feel sorry for the storyteller.
Melody notes, rhythms, and lyrics may differ from one 12-bar phrase to the 
next, but the chords usually stay the same. The chords most often used in 
the 12-bar form are all seventh chords; they are as follows:
	
✓	The I7 chord: Chord with the first scale note as its root note
	
✓	The IV7 chord: Chord with the fourth scale note as its root note
	
✓	The V7 chord: Chord with the fifth scale note as its root note
These three chords appear in the same order and for the same number of 
measures every time the 12-bar phrase is repeated. (Seventh chords are 
introduced in Book III Chapter 6.)
To play your own 12-bar blues, just follow these easy instructions, playing 
with either hand or both hands. When you have the chord progression mem­
orized, try playing the chords with the left hand while your right hand plays 
a simple melody, riff, or blues scale.
	
1.	Play an I7 chord for four measures.
	
2.	Play an IV7 chord for two measures.
	
3.	Play an I7 chord for two measures.
	
4.	Play a V7 chord for one measure.
	
5.	Play an IV7 chord for one measure.
	
6.	Play an I7 chord for two measures.
	
7.	Repeat Steps 1 through 6 until you have your audience singing 
with you.
	
Figure 4-1 (Track 92) shows an example of 12-bar blues that uses chords only. 
They may be just chords, but you should still play them with conviction.

Changing it up
All blues players realize that the same chords over and over can become 
repetitive (to both audience and musician), so they substitute other chords 
within the 12-bar form. For example, try a IV chord in measure 2 and play a 
V7 chord in measure 12 as a turnaround, as shown in Figure 4-2.

Having Fun with Rock and Pop
Most early rock and pop songs follow the structure of either the 12-bar blues 
or the 32-bar blues. Chuck Berry’s “Johnny B. Goode” is one variation of the 
12-bar blues structure used in rock, as is the Rolling Stones’s “19th Nervous 
Breakdown.” The Beach Boys were masters of the 32-bar structure, using it in 
such songs as “Good Vibrations” and “Surfer Girl.” The Beatles also used this 
structure in many of their songs, including “From Me to You” and “Hey Jude.” 
Jerry Lee Lewis’s “Great Balls of Fire,” The Righteous Brothers’s “You’ve Lost 
That Loving Feeling,” and Led Zeppelin’s “Whole Lotta Love” all also use the 
AABA 32-bar form.

In 32-bar pop music, the music is broken into four 8-bar sections. Songs like 
Fats Waller’s “Ain’t Misbehavin’” and Duke Ellington’s “It Don’t Mean a Thing” 
follow the AABA 32-bar structure, whereas Charlie Parker took the rondo 
approach (ABAC) to the 32-bar variation in songs like “Ornithology” and 
“Donna Lee.”
Compound AABA form really should be called AABAB2 form (but it isn’t), 
because in this form, after you play the first 32 bars, you move into a second 
bridge section (B2) that sends you right back to the beginning of the song 
to repeat the original 32 bars of the song. The Beatles’s “I Want to Hold 
Your Hand,” The Police’s “Every Breath You Take,” and Tom Petty and the 
Heartbreakers’s “Refugee” all follow this pattern.
The verse-chorus structure (also called ABAB form) is the most widely used 
form in rock and pop music today. Verse-chorus form follows the struc­
ture of the lyrics attached to it. You can, of course, write an instrumental 
piece that follows the same pattern as a verse-chorus rock or pop song, 
but the structure itself gets its name from the way the words in a song fit 
together.
	
Verse-chorus songs are laid out like this:
	
✓	Introduction (I): The introduction sets the mood and is usually instru­
mental, although sometimes it may include a spoken recitation, like in 
Prince’s “Let’s Go Crazy.”
	
✓	Verse (V): The verse begins the story of the song.
	
✓	Chorus (C): The chorus is the most memorable lyrical point of the 
song — the song’s hook.
	
✓	Verse (V): Another verse continues the story.
	
✓	Chorus (C): The second chorus reinforces the hook.
	
✓	Bridge (B): The bridge, which may be instrumental or lyrical, usually 
occurs only once in the song and forms a contrast with the repetition of 
verses and choruses.
	
✓	Chorus (C): The final chorus repeats the original chorus to fade, or it 
just stops at the I chord.
The typical rock/pop song structure, as described here, is IVCVCBC. And 
just as in the 12-bar blues structure, the chords of choice are the I, IV, and V 
chords.
Thousands, perhaps even millions, of popular songs follow this structure. 
The Beatles’s “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,” Tom Jones’s “Sex Bomb,” Kenny Rogers’s 
“The Gambler,” Lady Gaga’s “Poker Face,” and Eminem’s “Lose Yourself” are 
all examples of this structure used in contemporary pop music. The really 
amazing thing is how different from one another, either by virtue of lyrics or 
the music itself, one song can sound from the next.

Playing rock and pop songs
Pull out your bag o’ tricks and find the following musical ingredients to make 
any song rock:
	
✓	Rockin’ intervals
	
✓	Glissandos (see Book IV Chapter 1)
	
✓	Chords
	
✓	Lots and lots of pyrotechnics for your elaborate stage show (plus lights, 
makeup, big hair, a smoke machine — all the necessities)
Jerry Lee Lewis practically invented the classic rock piano sound. For this 
style, all you need is an opening glissando, fast chords, and lots of energy.
	
Pour these elements into the 12-bar blues form and you’re ready to roll. 
Figure 4-3 (Track 93) shows a rockin’ bass line that follows a typical blues 
chord progression in the key of C. (See the earlier section “Playing the blues” 
for more on blues chords.)

Pop! Goes the Piano
Arguably, every song on the radio is a popular song because few radio sta­
tions play songs that listeners don’t like. Country, rock, hip-hop, Latin, and 
many other styles of music are popular with one audience or another. But 
most people know the term pop (short for “popular”) to be the category 
for Top 40 songs and superstar ballads and dance numbers by such artists 
as Beyoncé, Black Eyed Peas, Celine Dion, Justin Timberlake, Prince, and a 
multitude of others.
Pop music can be rhythmic, romantic, nostalgic, funky, sad, and about 13 
other adjectives. This section concentrates on the one style of pop music 
perfectly suited to the piano: the slow and smooth-sounding pop ballad.
Popular picks
To play a pop ballad, you need a small arsenal of musical ornamentations, 
including the following:
	
✓	Right-hand intervals
	
✓	Chord arpeggios
	
✓	Damper pedal
	
✓	Dimmer switch (essential for setting the right mood)
Topping the charts
To add a little pop romance to any song, take a simple melody and add 
the ever-so-sweet sixth interval below each right-hand melodic note. The 
new melodic line should look like the one in Figure 4-4. For some reason 
unknown to many a trusted and frustrated musicologist, the sixth interval 
adds an element of romance to a melody.

This trick of adding the sixth may look difficult, but it’s not. All you do is find 
the sixth interval below the first melody note and freeze your hand in that 
position. Your pinkie always plays the top note and your thumb always plays 
the bottom interval note. As you play up and down the melody, your hand 
lands on the correct interval every time.
A Little Bit Country
Before there was rock and roll, there was country. This style often sounds 
relaxed, lyrical, simple, and grassroots-ish, but it ain’t afraid to rock, roll, and 
rumble. Artists like Keith Urban, Carrie Underwood, Shania Twain, and Brad 
Paisley put all kinds of musical influences in their country music, including 
elements of rock, blues, and even jazz. Influences aside, though, the folks in 
Nashville still call it country.
Country-style cooking
To enhance your musical dish with the tastes of country on the piano, add 
some of these stylistic flavorings:
	
✓	Intervals
	
✓	Grace notes
	
✓	Tremolos
	
✓	Bum-ba-di-da bass line
	
✓	A ten-gallon hat, a pair of boots, and maybe even a nice and shiny belt 
buckle (purchased from a local Western store)

Finger-pickin’ good
Figure 4-5 shows a nice, relaxed-sounding slice of the country music style. 
The right-hand intervals are unique in that the melody notes are actually 
on the bottom while the top notes stay the same. Grace notes and tremolos 
peppered throughout give this example the feeling of an Old West saloon.

The left-hand accompaniment pattern is challenging, so practice each hand 
separately until you can confidently put them together. After this inspiring 
tune, you may find yourself adding a saddlebag to your piano bench.
Improvising with Jazz
If there’s one particular music style that embraces all that the piano can do, 
it’s jazz. Celebrated by many as America’s greatest art form, jazz is king when 
it comes to interesting chord harmonies, changing rhythms, and improvisa­
tion. Legendary jazz pianists like Bill Evans, Art Tatum, Bud Powell, and many 
others have taken these elements and added them to classic songs to make 
them a little more jazzy.
The true spirit of jazz has always been improvisation, which makes identify­
ing the actual construction of jazz most difficult. The goal in jazz is to create 
a new interpretation of an established piece (called a standard), or to build on 
an established piece of music by changing the melody, harmonies, or even the 
time signature. It’s almost like the point of jazz is to break away from form.
The closest way to define how jazz is constructed is to take the basic idea 
behind blues vocalizations — the call-and-response vocals — and replace the 
voices with the various instruments that make up the jazz sound: brass, bass, 
percussion (including piano), and wind instruments, along with the more 
recent inclusion, the electric guitar. In Dixieland jazz, for example, musicians 
take turns playing the lead melody on their instruments while the others 
improvise countermelodies, or contrasting secondary melodies, that follow 
along in the background.
	
The one predictable element of music in the jazz genre — excluding free jazz, 
where no real discernible rules exist but jazz instrumentation is used — is the 
rhythm. All jazz music, with the exception of free jazz, uses clear, regular 
meter and strongly pulsed rhythms that can be heard throughout the music.
Jazzing it up
All the legendary jazz pianists use tried-and-true musical tricks from time to 
time to freshen things up. Borrow these tricks yourself:
	
✓	Chord substitutions (see the section “Substituting chords” later in this 
chapter)
	
✓	Swing rhythm
	
✓	Syncopation

351
 Chapter 4: Perusing Popular Genres and Forms

Styles
	
✓	Knowledge of scales
	
✓	Knowledge of chords
	
✓	Nickname like Duke, Bird, or Cool Cat
It’s up to you
It’s time to be creative. Improvisation is perhaps the most important element 
of jazz music. It can be literal improvisation, where you (the performer) make 
up your own rhythms and riffs, or implied improvisation, where the music is 
originally written in a way that just sounds improvised.
	
The easiest way to improvise is by changing the rhythm of a melody. For example, 
take the simple quarter-note melody of “Yankee Doodle” and transform it into a 
swingin’ jazz tune by adding swing eighth notes, syncopation, and a well-placed 
rest now and then to keep things cool (see Figure 4-6, Track 94).

Substituting chords
Few jazz compositions use the standard major and minor chords throughout. 
In fact, few jazz pianists play the original chords written in a song. Instead, they 
break the rules and substitute new chords to liven up otherwise simple melodies.
Figure 4-7 is the well-known children’s song “Merrily We Roll Along.” As you 
play it, notice the simple chord progression of C-G7-C.
	
Figure 4-7: 
“Merrily” 
with 
standard 
chords.
	
Even “Merrily We Roll Along” can sound not-so-childish with the use of chord 
substitution. The idea is to find a more interesting chord progression from I to 
V7 to I. Try the following options:
	
✓	Use major scale tones for chord roots. Move up the scale from C to G7, 
building triads on each successive scale note, as in Figure 4-8.

Soul Searching
Talk about a broad category of music! Soul can encompass anything from 
R&B (“rhythm and blues”) to gospel, hip-hop, and rap. Such soulful styles 
have been made popular by artists like Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, and 
Otis Redding, and can feature a lot of wonderful piano playing. It’s also great 
for dancing, although not so much while sitting at the piano.

354
Book IV: Refining Your Technique and Exploring Styles 
Saving your soul
Danceable soul music requires danceable rhythms, so have the following 
rhythmic concepts in your repertoire before strutting over to the keys:
	
✓	Syncopation
	
✓	Right-hand intervals
	
✓	Dotted eighth-sixteenth pattern
	
✓	Disco ball (rent from your local party supply outlet)
Motown sounds
In the 1960s, Motown Records had a stable of artists specializing in the R&B 
sound. So popular were these artists that their style became known as the 
Motown sound. But don’t think the 1960s are gone; you can add the Motown 
sound to any of your favorite songs.
	
Using a left-hand pattern with a syncopated rhythm, play Figure 4-11 (Track 95). 
Pretty soon you’ll be hearing the Temptations doo-wopping right along 
with you.

T

his chapter is all about teaching your hands to do what you want them to 
do. It covers the technique of passing under and crossing over, gives you 
plenty of practice playing different intervals, and ends with lots of pointers 
on playing smoothly and easily, without tension.
Passing Over and Crossing Under
One of the biggest challenges in developing good technique is smoothing out 
the transitions as you move your hands up and down the keyboard. Imagine 
playing fluid lines, shifting hand positions seamlessly, and covering the 
keyboard territory with flexible fingering. You often hear people say, “They 
make it look easy,” when they watch great piano players. That’s because 
great piano players have figured out how to make it easy for themselves.
Before Bach’s time, keyboard players avoided using their thumbs, which must 
have resulted in some really awkward fingerwork. Adding the thumb means 
you can play more notes within one hand position, but the problem remains 
that the thumb has a very different size, shape, and angle when compared with 
the other fingers. If you run out of fingers when the melodic line continues up 
or down, you have to move your hand position, and do it without breaking the 
musical line. The two best options are to pass the thumb under or cross the 
other fingers over.

360
Book V: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
The keyboard terrain sets up different scenarios for these transitions, with 
possibilities available in the various white and black key combinations. 
Because the thumb is shorter, the easiest way to cross over it or pass it under 
is with a black-white combination, because you can use the key height and 
location to your advantage. With one of your long fingers on a black key you 
naturally elevate your hand, like a bridge, for your thumb to pass under. With 
your thumb on a white key, it’s easier to cross a long finger over if it’s reaching 
for a black key. It’s more difficult to pass or cross from white key to white key 
because you have less room to pass under and farther to cross over. These 
more difficult transitions can cause you to twist your hand position, flare out 
your elbow, tuck in your elbow, or otherwise contort yourself as you move up 
or down the keyboard, and the extra movement can get in the way of playing 
smoothly and comfortably.
The answer is to keep your hand quiet and keep your arm perpendicular to the 
keyboard as you move out to the extremes or into the middle. This will make 
your scale runs sound smooth and feel more comfortable. But making these 
traverses seamless does take practice. The exercises in this section give you 
practice crossing over and passing under with different finger combinations, 
using a variety of scales. You also find out how to make these transitions more 
comfortable.
The performance piece at the end of the section showcases your smooth 
scale runs. It’s an arrangement of an aria from the opera La Cenerentola 
(Cinderella) by Rossini.
One under two, two over one
You first want to find a hand shape that eases the transition from one hand 
position to the next. Start by making a rounded “O” shape with fingers one 
and two. It helps to keep the two fingertips relatively close together and the 
top of your hand raised high but still flat.
	
Now feel your fingertips on each key as you play the following exercise 
(Track 96). Make sure you’re not flattening your thumb or hitting the key with 
the side of your thumb. Similarly, watch that you’re not overextending your 
2nd finger; you want to come down on the key with the center of your finger­
tip. You may find it easier to straighten your 2nd finger a bit as it crosses over 
your thumb to play a black key and curve it a bit when it plays a white key. 
You can apply this to your 3rd and 4th fingers in the following exercises.

Work on smoothing out your hand movements with this exercise (Track 97). 
Keep your hand position quiet and watch for twisting. Moving sideways 
smoothly, make sure not to collapse your wrist when your thumb passes 
under. Control the volume of a note by planning a hand shape that allows 
control of the attack speed. Guide fingers to perform a smooth movement.

362
Book V: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
	 	
One under four, four over one
This finger combination is more challenging because you need to contract 
your hand fully for the position shift and still make it sound smooth and 
effortless. Make sure the crossing/passing finger hits the nearest spot on 
the key to strike it comfortably. Watch your fingers carefully to see whether 
you’re overreaching.

Playing Intervals
Playing piano can be like having a choir at your fingertips. You have a ten-
member group, some are shorter and some are taller, some like to show off 
and some prefer to blend in, and one or two really don’t take well to being 
singled out. As the conductor of the fingertip chorale, you have control over 
how each “voice” in your choir responds to your direction. You can bring up 
the bass, hush the choir while the soprano has a solo, or lift up every voice 
for the full-out finale.
This section gives you some exercises to gain command over each finger 
combination so that when you’re playing two notes together you have the 
strength and control to balance and blend. These interval exercises also let 
you scrutinize the many combinations of fingers, intervals, and positions on 
the keyboard to get to know how each finger responds. Special attention is 
given to strengthening those fingers that need it the most.
Playing seconds with different 
finger combinations
Seconds are any interval combination on adjacent keys, white or black. 
Because of the keyboard layout, that means a variety of hand and finger 
positions to work on.
Each of the finger combination exercises in this section includes a study for 
the right hand and the left hand separately. Play through these exercises a few 
times slowly at first — concentrating on each hand — listening carefully to 
adjust the balance and timing of each finger combination. Curve your fingers 
and keep the finger joints firm to play the seconds evenly. Then gradually 
increase your speed each time you play the exercise. As you increase your 
speed and accuracy, play this section as a series, starting with the right and 
left hand in the first finger combination, moving on to the right and left hand 
in the next finger combination, and so on.
	
As you play the seconds with each finger combination, imagine the two fingers 
moving together as one unit. In the first combination, for example, finger two 
and finger three move together to strike each interval in a synchronized 
motion.

Playing Chords Without Tension
Chord playing is one of the greatest pleasures — and biggest advantages — of 
playing the piano. The piano sounds best when you make the most of its full 
harmonic potential.
To get your piano to really sing out, you need flexibility in the wrist to 
increase your attack speed when you play chords. To balance, or voice, the 
chord notes, you need control in your fingers to vary the quality of your 
touch. Naturally, you want to dig into the big chords and get your hands 
around the really fat harmonies, but keeping stiff fingers and awkward 
hand positions is tiring and can potentially cause some physical problems. 
Avoiding these problems and improving your chord voicing are the benefits 
of learning how to relieve the tension in your fingers, hands, and arms.
This section helps you learn to play chords with a relaxed approach, gain a 
better chord technique, and improve your sound. You can use the exercises 
to develop fluid motion and release muscle tension as part of a cycle to 
practice with each chord. The exercises start with single chords, move into 
a variety of chord progressions, and then combine melody with chords.
Chord relaxation
The most important thing to do is make sure you don’t hold tension in your 
hands, arms, and body when you play chords. You do need a certain amount 
of muscle tone and firmness in the finger joints to play nice, solid chords, 
but you also want to build in the habit of releasing tension while you play. As 
you exercise, monitor your body for any area in which you may be holding 
tension — your arms, shoulders, neck, or even your face (in the form of a gri­
mace or facial tic). Your aim is to breathe through your body as you play and 
to establish a cyclical pattern of tension and release.
A simple two-chord progression
Start with this simple two-chord progression, and put the following steps into 
a cycle for each chord.

383
 Chapter 1: Developing Hand Technique
Book V
Exercises:

1.	 With your hands held slightly above the notes in the chord, imagine the 
shape of the chord in your mind and feel (but don’t play yet!) that shape 
in your fingers.
	
2.	 Allow your arm weight to drop onto the keyboard as you comfortably 
play the chord and hold the shape in your fingers.
	
3.	 With a loose, flexible feeling in your wrists, let the weight travel and be 
absorbed in your wrists with a light bounce.
	
4.	 Keeping the chord notes held down, let the wrist float back up and 
release the notes under your fingers as you lift up from the keyboard, 
releasing any muscle tension in your fingers, hands, arms, and shoulders.
During the rest between the two chords, release any tension throughout your 
arms and torso, and prepare for the next chord shape as in step 1.
A longer progression
Now try practicing the cycle in a longer progression. Don’t hold any 
stiffness — after playing a chord, let your wrist relax and absorb the weight 
you’ve put into the keys. Instead of channeling the weight to your fingertips 
and holding it there as you press down the keys, let it travel to your wrists 
where the weight is absorbed and released with a slight bounce. You need 
to maintain just enough muscle tone and shape in your hands and fingers to 
hold down each chord note.

384
Book V: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
	 	
Finding the places to release muscle tension depends on the type of chordal 
passage you’re playing. During a rest you have an obvious spot to relax your 
hands and release your muscles. On long-held chords you can release tension 
while holding down the notes, and you can find quick “breaths” as you release 
staccato chords. You’ll have plenty of examples to practice these releases in 
the following exercises.
Voicing chords
Every time you strike a chord you get to be a sound engineer — you can set 
your own equalizer (EQ) levels with each chord. Maybe you want to hear more 
bass, more top note, or bring out the notes in the middle for the fullest sound 
possible. Most of the time you want the top note to sing out the strongest, 
with support from the bottom note next and the inner chord notes balanced 
next. When you play chords, you continually fine-tune your voicing to high­
light melodic movement that takes place within a chordal setting.
You can custom-balance each chord tone with subtle differences in your 
attack speed. You achieve this with variations in the quality of touch for each 
finger. The piano is designed to transmit and, in effect, amplify these nuances 
from the key to the hammer to the strings and into sound. Any number 
of variations in your touch affect the attack speed of each chord tone. 
Experiment with voicing in the next exercise, bringing out the moving voice, 
which changes from the top, to the middle, to the bottom note of the chord.
	
When you want to bring out a certain note within a chord, try using a gentle 
touch on the other chord notes. A gentle touch should slow the attack speed, 
bringing down their volume.

ou’ve come to the chapter of scales, the heart of piano exercises. If you 
love them, you’ll find lots to keep you happy here, and maybe some new 
scales to challenge your fingers. If you don’t love them, well, hopefully you’ll 
like them a little more after you try a few of them in a new presentation.
You can get a good workout here, with scales and fingering for all 12 major, 
harmonic minor, and melodic minor scales, plus diminished, chromatic, and 
blues scales. It’s paradise if you seek speed and accuracy and if you love pat­
terns. There’s nothing like the feeling of flying up and down the keyboard as 
your scale-fingering starts clicking and you feel a lightness in your touch.
The 12 Major, Harmonic Minor, 
and Melodic Minor Scales
	
The major and minor scales are the backbone of piano technique. And for 
good reason — much of the music we love is based on these scales. Each scale 
is just two octaves up and down, grouped so you can play the major, harmonic 
minor, and melodic minor scales starting on the same note before moving on 
to the next key. You follow the Circle of Fifths, starting with C (Track 104). 
Follow the fingerings carefully, playing slowly or hands-alone to start.

The Three Diminished Scales
The diminished, or octatonic, scale is unique and fun to practice because of 
its symmetrical pattern. The eight-note scale follows a whole-step/half-step/
whole-step/half-step pattern, which means you can think of every other note 
as the root of a diminished scale consisting of the same eight notes.

T

he first half of this chapter shows you how to continue practicing 
­single-note lines in each hand, now with melodies that move in paral­
lel and contrary motion. These exercises increase your hand and finger 
­independence and improve your coordination. The key is to integrate the 
multiple movements into a single feeling. You’re teaching your body to feel 
a combination of movements as one and adapting mentally to imagine the 
whole rather than all the parts. Put it all together in the performance piece, 
“Turkey in the Straw.”
The second, piano-centric half of the chapter is all about your right foot 
and what it can do together with your hands. You’ll find out how to use the 
­sustain pedal to get a range of different sounds, blend tones, and bring off 
tricks that you can’t do without it.
Parallel Movement at the Octave
	
These exercises are similar to scales but with more melodic flexibility in the 
movement of the lines. Normal scale fingering applies most of the time, but the 
music takes you away from these patterns. The key to good fingering is finding 
the most comfortable solution to fit the music (exercise #1 is Track 108).

Using the Damper Pedal
	
The piano is essentially a percussion instrument. It produces a pitch that has 
a quick attack when you strike a key and the hammer strikes the strings. If you 
hold this key down, the pitch has a slow decay, because you’re keeping the 
damper inside the piano off the string, allowing it to vibrate freely. But after 
you release the key, the damper returns to stop the string from vibrating, stop­
ping the sound. Sustaining the sound is possible with the sustain pedal, which 
keeps the damper off the strings for you.
By using the pedal in a careful way, you gain a greater range of expression. It 
can help you to “sing” a melody, connect music in phrases, and create greater 
resonance and atmospheric illusions. Overuse of the pedal can have some big 
drawbacks — unintentional mixing of harmonies, blurring notes, and obscur­
ing any articulation that should be clear. Your careful and attentive listening 
helps avoid these problems.
Pedaling Chords
The two most common pedaling indications are shown in the following figure. 
Press the pedal down at the “Ped.” sign, and release (pedal up) at the asterisk 
or at the bracket ending the line. These indications are always shown below 
the bass staff.
	 	

421
 Chapter 3: Improving Finger Coordination and Footwork
Book V
Exercises: 
Practice, 
Practice, 
Practice
The notch in the line in the following figure indicates where to change the pedal, 
quickly clearing any sustained sound (pedal up) and resetting the sustain (pedal 
down). Changing the pedal requires careful attention to clearing the harmony 
cleanly and completely.
	 	
Good pedaling is a matter of timing and listening. Your goal is to train your 
ear to listen for a smooth transition and a clean change from note to note and 
chord to chord. You don’t want to time your pedaling to match your hands, 
releasing and then pressing the pedal down as your fingers move from one 
chord to another; if you do, you’ll hear a gap between chords. This is because 
you’re lifting both the keys and the pedal together, so the dampers stop the 
sound when your fingers leave the keys. You need the sustain pedal down at 
this time. You have to wait to change the pedal so it happens simultaneously 
with playing the next chord.
Your heel should stay on the floor, and your toes can rest on the pedal. Some 
pedals require more weight and pressure, and foot size and power make a 
difference. You can use your longer toes plus some of the ball of your foot to 
press down the pedal, but as always go for comfort and ease. Your ankle is 
the hinge that allows your foot to move with the least amount of movement 
and effort. Pedaling shouldn’t affect your general posture, so if you find that 
you have to shift around or adjust your balance to accommodate pedaling, 
you may not have started from a good position.

Uniform Pedal Changes on One Line
Although changing the pedal with the change of harmony is a general rule, 
change it more frequently when you’re also playing a melodic line. With a 
slow melody, you may change the pedal before the harmony changes so the 
melody doesn’t get too blurry.

with the Light Brown Hair.”

Pedaling for Effect
	
Use the sustain pedal for atmospheric effect (sustaining for a blurred effect) 
or to sustain a note or chord over several measures. Here, the pedal helps

in the other (Track 113).

Sustaining as the Hands Move
	
You can use the pedal to give notes their full value when you have to move 
your hands to a new position on the keyboard. This can be a plus musically, 
because you can exaggerate the rhythms and the differences between the long 
and short articulations (Track 114).

The pedal is up when the melody is in the left hand, and down when the melody

(Track 115).

overing the full territory of the 88 keys is certainly one of the enticing 
attributes of the piano. Jumping registers, from low to high or high to 
low, is a potent tool that few other instruments can match. The exercises in 
this chapter give you practice jumping from one note to another and from 
chord to chord, over both smaller and larger intervals. This practice will help 
your accuracy as you move across the keyboard, help develop your “feel” for 
where your hands go, and improve your sense of distance.
This chapter also gives you lots of practice with the most common left-hand 
patterns — a variety of bass-note-to-chord accompaniments essential to playing 
waltzes, rags, marches, and many other dance rhythms. The exercises warm you 
up for the lively performance piece at the end of the chapter.
Jumping and Landing Accuracy
The key to making good, accurate jumps is the same whether the jump is big 
or small: Maintain a comfortable, balanced hand position as you jump from 
the starting hand position across the keyboard to your landing destination. 
Jumping with an overextended pinky and your hand outstretched like the 
descent of a giant hawk upon its prey is very common. Instead, the image 
you want to keep in mind is of a frog jumping from lily pad to lily pad. A frog 
starts and lands with its body centered over the lily pad, contracting to the 
same closed, restful shape. Your hands are two frogs. As they jump from one 
position to another, they should look the same before and after the jump. You 
can practice this skill with every exercise.

430
Book V: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
Note-to-note jumps
	
In this first exercise (Track 116), you try jumping from note to note. Visualize

Chord-to-chord jumps
You want just enough muscle flexion to keep your position stable. Your hands

  laying broken-chord patterns, or arpeggios, on the piano is very satisfying. 
In addition to the beauty and speed they can give your playing, they lend a 
bit of the style from the guitar and harp. In fact, arpeggio comes from the Italian 
word for harp, arpa.
Practicing arpeggio patterns is excellent for improving your accuracy while 
making short interval jumps from finger to finger, your crossover and pass-
under technique as you practice multi-octave arpeggios, and your finger con­
trol and independence.

are not only fun to play, but also useful in all kinds of keyboard music, from 
Scarlatti to Ravel, blues to Broadway.
Finger Jumps
	
In this section, you make a sequence of interval jumps from finger to finger. 
Your hand shape is open, with a wider span than five-finger position. The 
interval jumps are the same moves you make when you play arpeggios, but the 

444
Book V: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
exercises give you practice with each interval separately, starting with thirds 
(Track 120) and on to fourths and fifths. The fingerings in each exercise will 
guide your hand position changes, so take time to map them out as you play.

Playing guitar-style arpeggio patterns often involves spreading the chord out 
over both hands. The next song is an arrangement of the classic “Careless

Playing with Alternating Hands: 
Hand-to-Hand Scale Handoffs
A handoff is achieved by passing a melodic line from one hand to the other. 
Typically your left hand will hand off an ascending line to your right hand, 
and vice versa.
	
A hand crossover is for when you find it handy (and impressive) to cross one 
hand over the other to grab a note or a chord or two. Even if showing off isn’t your 
thing, the exercises here help bring both hands to an equal level, because they’re 
collaborating on the main musical part instead of one supporting the other.
As you hand off the scale from hand to hand, you want a smooth transition. 
Try to fool your ears; the handoff should be so smooth that you can’t tell 
where one hand takes over from the other. And you should hear no noticeable 
change in dynamic or articulation.
	
Some of these techniques look complicated written on the grand staff! Unless 
marked with a “R.H.” or “L.H.” your right hand will play the notes on the top 
staff, and your left hand will play the notes on the bottom staff.
Scale handoff exercise #1
	
Prepare the hand position for both hands before you begin each phrase. 
Playing a smooth scale in one hand is easier if the other is waiting quietly in 
position to take over. Listen to Track 124.

Y

es, octaves are hard. Everybody has to figure out how their own unique 
hands best meet the challenge. In this chapter, you’ll find some new 
exercises designed to help you examine and improve your octave technique, 
and you may also find some tips here to make playing octaves easier. In 
octave practice, you use your entire hand as a single unit. Good octave tech­
nique combines an open (but not overextended) hand position with a confi­
dent, comfortable arm drop. Most of your attention is focused on the position 
of your pinky and thumb, which play most of the notes.
The second half of the chapter covers chord progressions. The fun and 
­fascination of playing chord progressions comes in exploring their dual vertical 
and horizontal function. The vertical role is in each chord itself — how it’s con­
structed from bottom to top. The horizontal role is in the way chords progress 
from one to another.
Opening Up to the Octave
There is no single, best way for you to play octaves; what works for one 
person may be different for others. A lot depends on the size and shape of 
your hands and fingers. Closely examine the thumb and pinky joints to see 
whether they are collapsed or whether you can modify their angle for more 
control. Look to maximize your advantages and minimize your disadvantages.

464

Octave scale exercise
	
This exercise (Track 126) begins with your hand in an easy, open fifth position. 
As you expand the intervals out to a sixth, seventh, and then to the octave, 
maintain a consistent shape, control, and touch.

Octave interval exercise
For this one, try to keep the octave shape as you move across the keyboard 
over a variety of close intervals. Don’t tense your muscles into a locked grip. 
If your hands are big enough, use your 4th finger on the upper note.
	 	

466
Book V: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
Octave Jumps
Focus on your 5th finger — that’s where most of the misses happen. You’ll 
need more firmness in your pinky, with the thumb more relaxed and not 
grabbing. Aim down into the keys. Open your hand into a bigger arch for 
accuracy. Develop a clear mental image of where and how you’re moving and 
practicing a comfortable, confident hand move.

It’s easy to hear — the tension caused by a dominant seventh chord tells you 
that the chord is unresolved.
Seventh chord progressions exercise #1

Chord Cadences, Familiar Patterns
This section shows you some chord patterns you find frequently in all types 
of music: cadences, turnarounds, and sequences. A cadence is a short pro­
gression, usually two or three chords, that establishes tonality and resolu­
tion. Here are common cadences in C major and A minor.
	 	

476
Book V: Exercises: Practice, Practice, Practice 
Turnarounds get you “turned around” to go back to the home key. This usu­
ally means getting to the V chord, which leads back to the I chord. Chord 
sequences are fundamental building blocks of chord progressions.

his chapter aims to help you get a handle on how to get different sounds 
out of your keyboard. Have you ever watched a guitar player in concert 
step on some little box with his foot at different parts of the song? Or rock his 
foot forward and back on a pedal? He’s using effects to enhance and change 
his sound, turning different ones on and off for each part of the song. You can 
do the same with a keyboard.
Effects add qualities to the sound that the basic tone production method 
doesn’t include, so using them can change the character of any sound. Over 
time, well-established groups of effects have developed, most of which are 
explained in this chapter.
Your keyboard already has some effects configured with each sound, and 
you may or may not have much control over them. Working with the effects 
may be as simple as flipping an on/off switch or may go into greater detail. 
Developing the ability to hear and identify the various types of effects helps 
you recognize them being used in the music you listen to and reproduce 
those sounds for the songs you want to play.
A likely reason you’ve chosen to play an electronic keyboard is that it offers 
more than one sound. Having a variety of sound keeps you interested in 
playing longer. Can you imagine hearing Mozart played by Jimi Hendrix? 
Chuck Berry played with a flute? Nirvana played on a harpsichord? Having 
the right sounds for the type of music you like to play is essential. And that’s 
why a keyboardist is the luckiest musician of all. Your keyboard can trans­
form into any instrument you want at the push of a button. No other player 
has that power, so use it wisely!

Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
First Things First: Understanding 
Some Important Terminology
One of the most confusing things about shopping for keyboards, talking about 
them with your friends, or just using them is the crazy array of names used to 
describe the choice of sounds available. Even the term sound may not be that 
simple. Is “a sound” the re-creation of a single known instrument such as the 
piano or a pipe organ? The combination of multiple instruments being played 
at the same time, such as a whole orchestra or a big-band sax section? Two 
instruments being played together such as a guitar and a flute or an electric 
piano and a bass guitar?
All these things are possible, but this variety means you need a name for the 
individual “thing” a keyboard can reproduce, the combination of multiple 
“things,” and so on. To make matters worse, each company has its own name 
for each of these “things.”
This section tries to clear up this confusion and introduce you to a few con­
cepts about the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI for short), covered 
in greater detail in Book VI Chapter 3.
A sound by any other name: Recognizing 
the various terms
To keep things simple and clear, some refer to single “things” as sounds, 
and the combinations of “things” as multipart sounds. If only real life were 
so simple. Each manufacturer uses its own terms for these things, which 
creates a world of confusion. Take a look at Tables 1-1 and 1-2 to see what 
this means.

Table 1-1 shows a list of brand names and the name(s) they use for single 
sounds in their various keyboards.
What a crazy and confusing list of terms all meaning the same thing. Can’t we 
all just get along?
If that wasn’t confusing enough, some of these words have other meanings in 
music tech terms.
Tone can also mean the brightness or bassy quality of a sound. Many 
home stereos, guitar amplifiers, and other audio devices have a control 
for tone that doesn’t change to another instrument sound; it affects the 
EQ (brightness and bass amount) of the device (more about EQ toward 
the end of this chapter).
Voice is sometimes used when describing how many notes you can play at the 
same time, which is called polyphony (which means “many voices”). A guitar 
is six-note polyphonic (it has six strings), and an acoustic piano is 88-note 

484
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
polyphonic. As a side note, many instruments can only play one note at a time 
(woodwinds, brass, the human voice, some analog synthesizers), and they’re 
called monophonic. So a spec sheet for a keyboard may use the term 100-voice 
polyphony, meaning it can produce 100 notes at the same time.
Preset can also mean a memory location that can’t be changed or overwritten. 
Products that use this term list a number of Preset and User locations to 
describe what can’t and can be changed.
Moving on to the multipart sounds, Table 1-2 shows how different brands 
refer to these sounds in their keyboards.
Makes you wish you had a scorecard to follow, doesn’t it?
MIDI: Defining GM/GM2
As you look at web pages, literature, keyboard manuals, and keyboard front 
panels and displays, you’re going to come across General MIDI logos. General 
MIDI (GM) is a standard that defines a set of sounds, instrumental effects, and 
numerous standard features so MIDI-based music can be shared among vari­
ous devices (keyboards, computers, web pages, and even cellphones) and 
always sound the same. GM defines a set of 128 sounds that cover the most 
basic and universal group of instruments. So when you select a sound in the 
GM bank or group of sounds, it will sound similar to that same sound in any 
other brand or type of keyboard you have.
	
MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, a technology standard 
developed in 1983 by a number of keyboard companies to allow keyboards to 
“talk” to each other — to trigger sounds from one keyboard (the master) and 
have other keyboards (the slave) sound at the same time. This setup enabled 
layering of sounds between different keyboards and brands for a fuller sound. 
It has evolved into a universally supported and wonderful capability to not 
only play keyboards connected together but also to connect keyboards to 
computers for recording, sound editing, musical notation, and other activities. 
(MIDI is covered in more detail in Book VI Chapter 3.)
General MIDI 2 (GM2) is an expanded set of sounds that adds more diversity 
and variety to the library, but the concept remains the same: guaranteed 
sound conformity so that songs and arrangements can be reproduced with 
consistency and accuracy no matter what the playback device.
These logos indicate that the product includes the complete General MIDI 
sound set and responds properly to sound selection commands via MIDI. 
Figure 1-1 shows an example of these logos.

Two other GM-like standards are brand specific. GS is a Roland standard 
that’s similar to GM2, and XG is a Yamaha standard that goes even further 
than GM2. But the idea is the same (as far as sounds are concerned) — 
a pre-specified list of sounds that is always the same in products bearing 
the logo.
Knowing and Using Effects
Effects are used in electronic musical instruments, amplifiers, large sound 
systems in performance venues, and recording studios. Often, you don’t 
think about them; they’ve become a natural part of the sound you associate 
with an instrument. Some are easy to identify because they add a signature 
color and quality to a sound, but others are seemingly invisible because 
they correct or enhance the basic tonal nature of a sound without adding 
anything noticeable.
Here are the most common groups of effects:
	
✓	Tonal correction: This effect is commonly called EQ for equalizer or 
equalization. It’s like the basic treble and bass controls of a stereo but 
can be much fancier and more detailed.
	
✓	Volume control: Volume is often called gain in audio terms, but it means 
just what you think: the level of the sound. Effects such as a compressor, 
a limiter, and a preamp fall into this category.
	
✓	Modulation: Modulation is the broadest category of effects and the most 
obvious to hear. These effects add motion and color to your sound and 
can be subtle or wildly psychedelic. Popular effects include chorus, 
phase shifting, flanging, tremolo, and rotary speaker.

486
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
	
✓	Tonal coloration: This category is somewhat related to modulation but 
doesn’t add motion. It just colors, or changes, the sound. Common candi­
dates are distortion, amp models, and speaker simulators.
	
✓	Ambience: These effects simulate the characteristics of an environment 
such as a room, a large hall, a cathedral, or a canyon. Common effects 
are delay (distinct echoes) and reverb (a more indistinct wash of sound 
reflections).
Knowing these groupings, you can listen to a sound or a recording and start 
to define what you’re hearing. If an acoustic piano sound seems to be very 
far away and has some subtle echoes, you should think reverb and perhaps 
some delay. When you hear a very “crunchy” clavinet (clav) sound with a 
thick, aggressive quality, you may rightfully assume it’s being run through 
some distortion or perhaps an amp simulator (or a real guitar amp).
Meeting the Main Types of Effects
This book is about pianos and keyboards, not guitars or recording studios, so 
the following sections introduce you to only the most common effects you’ll 
find and want to use in your instrument. This section covers onboard effects; 
you can buy additional boxes to run your keyboard through, but covering 
those would require a separate book.
Reverb
Reverb adds space around your notes and can make your sound seem farther 
away, even dreamy. It’s short for reverberation, which describes the continu­
ation of sound in a particular space after the original sound is produced and 
stops or decays away. Reverb produces a kind of hazy or blurred type of echo 
that’s very pleasing to the ear and gives a sense of the space you’re playing in.
The character of a reverb is defined by several factors, including the following:
	
✓	The overall size of the space you produce the sound in
	
✓	The number of surfaces the sound can bounce off of (how enclosed is 
the room, how high is the ceiling, and so on)
	
✓	The material of the walls (wood, concrete, glass, or whatever), which 
affects how much sound they absorb and how distinct the repetitions/
reflections are
Put simply, various types of reverbs can make it sound like you’re playing in 
all kinds of different spaces.

487
 Chapter 1: Choosing Sounds and Effects
Book VI
Exploring 
Electronic 
Keyboard 
Technology
Keyboards typically give you a limited set of parameters you can use to 
adjust reverb. Here are the most common:
	
✓	Mix or wet/dry mix: Mix controls how much of your original, unaffected 
(dry) signal is passed on and how much of the reverberated (wet) signal 
is introduced. Often, just a little wet signal is good enough to produce a 
nice, not-too-sloppy sound. But sometimes a lot more of the wet signal is 
nice, giving your playing a spacious quality and majestic sound.
	
	The more notes you play or the faster the tempo, the less reverb you 
want to use. This way, all your playing can be clearly heard without blur­
ring together.
	
✓	Type: Type is an overall selection that sets the size of the space and 
other associated parameters, or even the method of producing the 
reflections. Common choices are room, hall, stage, cathedral, and so 
on. You may sometimes see plate or spring, which is a form of artificial 
reflection where a sound is played into a box that contains a metal plate 
or large spring, which vibrates from the incoming sound waves.
	
✓	Size: The size control defines the overall size of your chosen simu­
lated space. So a small room may seem like a tiny hallway or closet, 
and a large room may be 10 feet by 20 feet or 40 feet by 40 feet. The 
idea of a small cathedral or canyon may seem funny, but remember 
that the type of room is defined not only by its floor space but also 
by characteristics like ceiling height and the materials the walls are 
made of.
	
✓	Reverb time: This control simulates how long the sound reflections take 
to die away or stop sounding. It’s casually described as a length — a 
short reverb, a long reverb — and the reflections are sometimes called 
the reverb tail.
On many simple keyboards and digital pianos, mix and type may be your only 
control choices. More advanced reverbs that offer deeper programmability 
include parameters such as
	
✓	EQ: Shapes the tone of the sound a bit.
	
✓	Damping: Simulates how much of the sound is absorbed; higher values 
cause the reflections to come back darker or less bright.
	
✓	Pre-delay: Pushes back the whole reflective simulation, so your origi­
nal dry sound can be heard before the reflections start. Adding some 
pre-delay (or raising its existing value) helps your sound be clearer and 
more distinct before being wrapped in the ambience of the effect.
	
Track 132 plays examples of various reverb types.

Delay
Delay (sometimes called echo) is an ambience effect, adding the impression 
of space around your notes. But it works differently from reverb in that the 
reflections are distinct, clear echoes or repeats of the incoming notes. You’ve 
probably seen a cartoon where the character yells into the Grand Canyon 
and his exact words come back a few moments later. That’s delay. Used very 
subtly, it adds some ambience to your playing; brought up more in the mix it 
becomes a highly rhythmic counterpoint to play against.
The most common delay parameters your keyboard will let you adjust are
	
✓	Mix or wet/dry mix: Determines how much of your dry signal is passed 
on and how much the distinct echoes (wet sounds) are introduced.
	
✓	Delay time: Delay time controls the timing of the repetitions — specifically, 
the interval of time between the original signal and each repeat. It’s usually 
represented in milliseconds but can be set to note values or even rhythmic 
figures in more advanced instruments.
	
✓	Feedback: This parameter manipulates how many distinct repetitions 
will sound. At most settings, these repetitions decay in volume with 
each occurrence, so they seem to fade out.
	
	Be careful when adjusting this parameter! High feedback values can 
cause the repetitions to get louder and keep generating endlessly. 
Things can get very loud quickly and damage your speakers and/or 
hearing.
	
✓	Damping: Damping adjusts the brightness of each repetition to simulate 
the effect of sound absorption; each occurrence gets darker. Along with 
the level decay that may be built into feedback, damping helps keep 
your playing from sounding too cluttered.
	
Track 133 demonstrates delay.
Chorus/flanging/phase shifting
Chorus, flanging, and phase shifting are modulation effects that produce 
a warm, swirling sort of thickened sound. Each one sounds different, but 
they’re all closely related in concept and use.
	
Listen to Track 134 to hear flanging, chorus, and phase shifting demonstrated 
and compared.

Chorus
Chorus is produced by constantly varying the pitch of a slightly delayed copy 
of your sound. When this variation is mixed back with the original signal, 
it produces a pleasing, rich result. The chorus effect was first designed to 
sound like a choir of voices singing together, with the slight imperfections in 
tuning and timing that produced an ensemble sound.
Common chorus parameters to adjust on your keyboard include
	
✓	Mix or wet/dry mix: Controls how much of your dry signal is passed 
on and how much of the original-plus-varied (wet) signal is introduced. 
Unlike reverb, mix sounds better at higher, or wetter, values for chorus.
	
✓	Depth: This parameter indicates how much pitch variation is produced.
	
✓	Rate/frequency: This control adjusts the speed of the pitch variations. 
Very slow to medium sounds good; too fast, and your sound takes on a 
wobbly, underwater quality. But maybe that’s what you want.
More advanced choruses may have some built-in EQ to shape the tone of the 
sound and may offer a delay time parameter to determine the amount of time 
the signal is delayed. This parameter setting can be the critical difference 
between chorus and flanging (see the following section): Values between 
1 and 15 milliseconds produce flanging, and chorus starts at 20 milliseconds.
Flanging
Flanging is less warm than chorus because flanging’s closer delay time sounds 
more metallic and less like close copies of the original signal. Flanging adds one 
critical additional parameter: feedback.
Feedback routes some of the output back to the input, so the whole process 
starts again but on an already-affected sound. This accentuates the sweep 
and creates some resonant peaks in the harmonics, not unlike resonance or Q 
in a filter. At extreme feedback settings, flanging can produce a whoosh sort 
of sound resembling a jet takeoff.
Phase shifting
Phase shifting differs from chorus and flanging in that it doesn’t use a delay-
line shifted copy of the incoming signal, which has all frequencies shifted by 
the same amount. Rather, it mixes a copy of the sound that has been shifted 
slightly out-of-phase by an all-pass filter, which shifts different frequencies 
by different amounts. (Check out the later section “Filter” for details on this 
control.) This produces a very rich, warm sound with more tonal peaks than 
chorus, because it has a feedback loop in its design like the flanger does. And 
it sounds less metallic than flanging because of the differing frequency shifts.

EQ
EQ allows you to boost or cut the level of various frequency ranges within your sound. 
You can find EQ settings (with names like rock, jazz, concert hall, acoustic, dance, and 
so on) on your music players and electronics. They show multiple columns, each rep­
resenting a frequency or pitch area. If the bar is tall, it’s boosting that range; if it’s low, 
it’s cutting the range. Figure 1-2 shows a common representation of this setup.
	
Figure 1-2: 
Visual rep-
resentation 
of EQ.

Your keyboard’s EQ function gives you control over various frequencies 
that you can shape to change the tonal nature of your sound. The frequency 
ranges are represented as numbers in hertz (Hz) and kilohertz (kHz or k), 
such as 100 Hz or 2.5 kHz (2,500 hertz). Low frequencies are called bass, or 
lows, middle frequencies are called mids (naturally), and upper frequencies 
are called highs. EQs come in a couple of common types:
	
✓	A graphic EQ (see Figure 1-3) offers 5 to 31 frequencies, called bands, 
which are fixed values that can be cut or boosted.

✓	A hi-shelf EQ cuts or boost frequencies above the value defined (like a 
brightness control).
	
✓	A low-shelf EQ cuts or boost frequencies below a defined value (like a 
bass control).
	
✓	A parametric EQ offers some number of bands (usually between two and 
four); you can freely select their frequencies, so you can use them to 
flexibly shape the sound any way you want, as shown in Figure 1-4.
	
Figure 1-4: A 
parametric 
EQ.
	
Bias SuperFreq-6 EQ screenshot courtesy of Jerry Kovarsky
Some EQs combine these concepts, with a low-shelf band followed by one or 
two parametric bands and a hi-shelf band on top, for example. Or the outer 
bands can be changed from shelving to parametric as needed.
Keyboards commonly offer these parametric EQ parameters:
	
✓	Frequency: The pitch or frequency center for the band of EQ.
	
✓	Q: The width of frequencies that the cut or boost affects, sometimes 
called bandwidth. With a wide Q, you affect a broad range of your sound. 
You can use very narrow Q to reduce a harsh frequency or noise or add 
some extra emphasis to a specific noise or character of a sound.
	
✓	Gain: The amount that a band is boosted (a positive value) or cut 
(a negative value).
	
Many people think they need to boost a band to improve the sound, but cut­
ting a band can often be more effective. Reducing a frequency that is already 
covered by another sound (cutting bass so you can hear the bass guitar and 
bass drum better) is a good approach.

You can hear demonstrations of shelving and parametric EQs in Track 135.
Distortion
Distortion adds a dirty, harsh quality to your sound. You’re most familiar with 
this concept in rock guitar; the crunching rhythmic figures of classic riffs like 
“Smoke on the Water” by Deep Purple and “Satisfaction” by the Rolling Stones 
are well-known examples. Varying levels of distortion may be called overdrive, 
fuzz, or gain booster.
Distortion is created by overloading the input to an amplifier, causing the 
circuitry to produce internal clipping or errors. Nowadays, electronics and 
software code can readily imitate it without the need for an actual guitar amp.
Here are some common distortion controls you can adjust:
	
✓	Mix or wet/dry mix: This option controls how much dry signal is passed 
on, and how much of the distorted (wet) signal is introduced. Because 
distortion can be a very heavy effect, you get a better sound if you mix 
some dry signal in for clarity, especially for keyboard sounds. For emu­
lating rock guitar, you can never have too much distortion!
	
✓	Type or model: Many distortion effects are emulating other famous 
devices, be they classic guitar amplifiers, pedal effects (often called 
stomp boxes), or combinations thereof. The type control is where you 
decide which you want to use.
	
✓	Input gain: Input gain is the parameter that you turn up to produce the 
overloaded tone. Low values produce a slightly thicker, warmer sound, 
and higher values get crunchier up into full-out fuzz bliss.
	
✓	Output level: Because turning up the input increases the volume, you 
use this control to bring the overall level back down so you don’t blow 
the roof off your home!
	
✓	EQ: Many distortion effects include some type of tone controls to help 
tame or shape the sound further. This setup can range from a single tone 
knob or parameter to multiband graphic and parametric equalizers. 
(The preceding section has info on these types of equalizers.)

Rotary speaker
The rotary speaker effect emulates the famous spinning speaker cabinet (called 
a Leslie) invented for use with the Hammond organ. It was named after its 
creator, Donald Leslie, who wanted to make the organ sound more like a pipe 
organ, with its pipes spread out in a large space. What resulted is a strange 
yet wonderful-sounding contraption that has two spinning speakers inside. 
They spin at different speeds, producing a rich, moving quality to the sound. 
They can be switched to spin slowly or very quickly — a dramatic effect that 
organists use to build excitement for various parts of a song.
The rotary speaker is an integral part of the tonewheel organ sound but has 
also been used by rock guitar players, on other electric keyboard sounds, 
and even on vocals (John Lennon famously sang through one on the song 
“Tomorrow Never Knows”).
This speaker is a complex effect that may or may not have more parameters 
to adjust (you may only have the option to toggle the speed control from 
slow to fast). That said, common adjustable factors include the following:
	
✓	Horn/rotor speed: The upper horn can rotate at two different speeds, 
each of which may be adjusted. Similarly, the lower spinning drum (the 
rotor) has a two-speed control as well.
	
✓	Horn/rotor acceleration and deceleration: These control the time the 
horn and rotor each take to transition from slow to fast and back again.
	
✓	Mode: Mode chooses whether the speaker is stopped or spinning. 
Completely stopping the speakers from spinning is called brake, and 
some designs allow all three states — brake, slow, fast — to be used. 
(Early Leslies had two settings: no spinning and spinning fast.)
	
✓	Horn/rotor balance: Microphones are usually placed by the rotary speaker 
to further amplify it in concert or to record it in the studio. This control 
positions the mic to be closer to the high horn (producing a brighter, 
thinner sound) or lower by the spinning drum (producing a bassier, 
heavier sound). More advanced designs allow you to choose the position 
and distance for each microphone.
	
Listen to Track 137 to hear the rotary speaker effect.
Filter
A filter is a tone-modifying control that allows certain frequencies to pass through 
while blocking others. The point at which it gradually starts to remove the 
frequencies is called the filter cutoff. Book VI Chapter 3 talks more about filters.

494
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Common tone parameters you can adjust on your keyboard are
	
✓	Type: The most common filter type is called a low-pass, which allows 
all frequencies below the cutoff to pass through, gradually removing 
everything above it. A high-pass filter does the opposite, only allowing 
frequencies above the cutoff to pass through.
	
✓	Cutoff: The point at which the filter gradually starts to remove frequen­
cies by fading them out. Moving around this cutoff point (called sweeping 
the cutoff) produces a very cool sound, most often associated with 
synthesizer sounds.
	
✓	Resonance or Q: This parameter emphasizes frequencies close to either 
side of the cutoff, like a sharp, narrow band of EQ boost. It produces a 
nasal, piercing quality at high settings and sounds great when combined 
with the sweeping of the cutoff. A classic synth sound effect.
	
Check out Track 138 to hear demonstrations of various filters.
Wah-wah and auto-wah
The wah-wah is a filter placed into a rocking pedal to make it easy to sweep 
the cutoff with your foot while playing. Commonly used for guitar, it’s also 
popular for keyboards, especially the clav.
The auto-wah (also called envelope follow filter or envelope filter) produces 
the sweep movement based on the incoming audio signal, so you don’t need 
to move your foot. Each note or chord played triggers the sweep, letting you 
easily play highly rhythmic parts without wearing out your ankle. Common 
auto-wah parameters that keyboards let you adjust include the following:
	
✓	Response/rate: Controls the speed at which the filter opens up in reac­
tion to the incoming signal.
	
✓	Decay: Sets the length of time the filter takes to close back down.
	
✓	Range/manual/frequency: Sets the frequency of the filter cutoff at the 
bottom and top of the sweep. This control is helpful to optimize the 
effect for the type of sound you’re using it on (bass, type of keyboard 
sound, guitar).
	
	Note: This parameter is the only one that would be available for a 
wah-wah effect.
	
✓	Sensitivity: Adjusts the range of the sweep, based on the strength of 
the incoming signal. Low settings don’t allow the range of the sweep 
to change much based on the incoming signal. At higher settings, soft 
levels produce very little sweep (a darker sound), and stronger signals 
produce a more full-range sweep.

495
 Chapter 1: Choosing Sounds and Effects

Higher sensitivity helps produce the more expressive and dramatic auto-wah 
effect. But it needs to be adjusted to match your playing technique and how 
hard or soft your touch is. Adjust the setting up or down until it’s easy to pro­
duce and control the range of sweep you like.
	
Track 139 plays examples of wah and auto-wah.
Choosing Effects for Each Type Of Sound
Certain instrument and effect combinations are matches made in rock-and-roll 
heaven! Some are commonly used based on musical genre (funk and wah-wah, 
for example), and others are associated with specific artists.
To help you get the sound you want for various songs, the following sections 
list the essential keyboard sounds and the effects commonly used and asso­
ciated with them, often naming artists and songs as examples. 
Note: Reverb is used on pretty much everything, so it’s not highlighted here.
Piano-type and synth sounds
You can use keyboard effects with many common piano sounds:
	
✓	Acoustic piano: Sometimes a little EQ can help modify a piano for a spe­
cific song or style of music. Classical sounds good with a less bright, more 
mellow sound, and rock works with a much brighter piano to stand out 
when drums and guitars are playing. Some pop and rock music uses a little 
chorus on the piano (think of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’”), and deeper 
chorus with more pitch variation (an increase of the depth parameter) 
helps make piano sound more honky-tonk.
	
✓	Tine/Rhodes electric piano: So many effects can work on this classic 
instrument:
 
• Phase shifting: Use subtle phaser settings to get that Billy Joel “Just 
the Way You Are” sound, Steely Dan/Donald Fagen tunes (check 
out “Green Flower Street”), late 1980s Doobie Brothers (“Minute by 
Minute”), or the immortal sound of Richard Tee as featured on many 
Paul Simon, Grover Washington (“Just the Two of Us”), and Stuff 
recordings.
 
• Chorus: Using a chorus helps to get the sound of Jamiroquai as 
well as the whole L.A. 1980s sound (think Al Jarreau, Toto, Quincy 
Jones, Chicago, and early Yellowjackets).

496
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
 
• Distortion/wah-wah: To sound like vintage/early 1970s jazz, fusion, 
and rock artists, don’t use any modulation effect. Do use EQ if 
needed to darken the sound a little bit. However, a little distortion 
(not too much) helps to get the aggressive solo sound of fusion 
players like Jan Hammer (Mahavishnu Orchestra’s “Inner Mounting 
Flame”), Chick Corea (early Return to Forever), and George Duke 
(solo and with Frank Zappa), who often played through guitar amps. 
Many artists also used wah-wah, still a good way to “funk-up” electric 
piano (both tine and reed versions).
 
• Delay: You can use delay to get the spacey sound of early electric 
Herbie Hancock (“Mwandishi” and “Headhunters”), Brian Auger 
(“Live Oblivion”), Ramsey Lewis (“Sun Goddess”), and many reggae 
and dub recordings.
	
✓	Reed/Wurlitzer electric piano: This electric piano wasn’t processed 
with effects as much, but the number one application is putting a deep 
chorus on it to get that Supertramp sound (“Logical Song” and “Goodbye 
Stranger”). EQ and distortion can help to get a stronger rock sound.
	
	Many people like putting electric piano through a rotary speaker.
	
✓	Clavinet: Clavinet through a wah-wah or auto-wah is one of the ­classic 
sounds of funk music. Listen to songs like Stevie Wonder (“Higher 
Ground” and “Maybe Your Baby”), Billy Preston (“Outa-Space”), Rufus 
(“Tell Me Something Good”), Herbie Hancock (“Chameleon”), and 
the funkiest non-funk tune ever recorded, The Band’s “Up on Cripple 
Creek.” It was also prominently featured in reggae, like in Bob Marley/
the Wailers “Burnin’ and Lootin’” and “Get Up, Stand Up.”
	
	Distortion also sounds good on clav, which often was played through 
a guitar amp. You can hear this effect in varying degrees on the afore­
mentioned Billy Preston songs, Stevie Wonder (“We Can Work It Out”), 
Led Zeppelin (“Trampled Under Foot”), Phish’s “Tubes,” and the always-
amazing John Medeski (Medeski Martin & Wood).
	
✓	Tonewheel organ: A lot of famous organists have pretty specific and 
well-known sounds:
 
• Tonewheel organ and Leslie go hand in hand. Many jazz players 
are known for using only the brake and fast settings, whereas most 
rock, soul, and other players use the slow and fast speeds. Two 
prominent exceptions in rock/soul are Steve Winwood (solo and 
with Traffic and Blind Faith) and Booker T. (solo and with Booker T. 
& the MG’s), who both favor brake and fast settings.
 
• Progressive rocker Keith Emerson ran his organ through both 
Leslies and guitar amps to get more overdrive in his sound. He 
also used a distortion pedal effect on the smaller L-100 he’d abuse 
nightly to get feedback from it (find live versions of “Rondo”

to hear/see this in action). Hard-rock organist Jon Lord (Deep 
Purple) stopped using a rotary speaker altogether, favoring using 
guitar amps to crank up his sound to match the rest of the band 
(“Machine Head” and “Made in Japan”). Jazz/rock organist Brian 
Auger is another famous non-Leslie user.
 
• Tony Banks (Genesis) ran his tonewheel organ through a phase 
shifter and sometimes a chorus; listen to albums like Wind and 
Wuthering, And Then There Were Three, and Duke.
	
✓	Synth sounds: This group is a vast category, and basically, anything is 
possible. Have fun!
Guitar sounds
You really should add some effects to the guitar sounds coming out of your 
keyboard to make them more realistic and pleasing. Here are some ideas:
	
✓	Guitar: Guitar works well with a wide variety of effects. All the modulation 
effects can sound good, as do delay and reverb when you want to play 
more open, arpeggiated background parts. Andy Summers (The Police) 
and especially The Edge (U2) are famous for this. For stronger rock 
songs and solos, distortion and amp models become an important part 
of your needed sound. Wah-wah works well for some rock songs and 
certainly for funky tunes, and auto-wah is perfect for funk.
	
✓	Bass guitar: Bass is the one sound that doesn’t want much reverb, if any. 
Keeping it dry helps to anchor the feel and clarity of a song’s groove. 
Sometimes subtle chorus or flanging can work, especially on fretless 
bass. For heavier rock and metal music, distortion is appropriate. Auto-
wah can work for some funk.
Other sounds
What to do with more-orchestral instruments? Less is more:
	
✓	Wind/brass instruments: These instruments rarely require anything 
more than a little reverb to taste.
	
✓	Strings: All acoustic instruments sound good with reverb. String parts 
in songs sometimes come from real strings or from electronic string 
synthesizers and such. Slight chorus or phasing adds animation and 
movement to these instruments.

rums and rhythm are the most primal aspect of music; all music fans 
have tapped on their legs/knees/steering wheels to their favorite songs. 
It’s a natural reaction to a song with a good groove. If you don’t know any 
drummers, onboard drum rhythms on keyboards can make a fine rhythmic 
partner for practicing and playing. Onboard drums are much more fun and 
inspiring rhythm-keepers than a metronome.
This chapter takes you through possibilities of using onboard drum machines 
and backing parts that feature drum and percussion rhythm. You discover 
how to use them as good practice and performance tools and how to vary 
the parts so things don’t get boring. Later the chapter expands on this idea 
for full-band auto-accompaniment, adding some controls that help the drum­
mer and the rest of the band keep things interesting.
For some people, the concept of automatic accompaniment brings up images of 
hokey one-finger mall organ demos and corny ’80s ads. All too often, “serious” 
musicians looked down their noses at these products.
Well, the fact is, the sound realism and musical quality of the auto-accompaniment 
in today’s keyboards are markedly improved and nothing to scoff at. They 
can provide a child, student, or casual player with tools to help him play better 
and enjoy his time making music, which is a wonderful thing. Across Europe, 
Asia, and the Middle East, accompaniment keyboards are the professional 
keyboard; very skilled players use them (in public!) with pride.

Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
This chapter shows you how to get auto-accompaniment features started and 
how you can feed them the chords they need to generate their full backing 
band parts. It goes under the hood a little to better understand the musical 
parts that make up their patterns and shows you plenty of tips and tricks to 
keep the parts interesting and not canned-sounding.
If you’re a fan of late-’70s and ’80s pop, synth-pop and new wave music, or the 
club dance music since the turn of the 21st century (trance, electro, hardstyle, 
and so on), then you’ve heard an arpeggiator in action. Early synth artists and 
producers such as Jean Michel Jarre, Giorgio Moroder, Gary Numan, Thomas 
Dolby, Howard Jones, and Duran Duran used synths and arpeggiators in many 
of the pop and dance hits of their eras. Not sure what that means? Have you 
heard any of these songs?
	
✓	Donna Summer: “I Feel Love”
	
✓	Duran Duran: “Rio,” “Save a Prayer,” and “Hungry Like the Wolf”
	
✓	Eurythmics: “Here Comes the Rain Again”
	
✓	Talking Heads: “Once In a Lifetime” intro
	
✓	Irene Cara: “Flashdance (What a Feeling)”
	
✓	Cyndi Lauper: “All Through the Night”
	
✓	Alan Parsons Project: “Games People Play”
	
✓	Erasure: “Drama,” “Chains of Love” intro
In each of these songs, you hear a repeated synth figure of some sort; up high 
in the background, for the bass line, or providing an outline of the chordal 
harmony. That’s an arpeggiator — often abbreviated arp — in action, and for 
many people, that type of sound is the definition of the sound of a synthe­
sizer in popular music. At the end of this chapter, you’ll discover the basics 
of arpeggiation and some of the most common settings to tweak. Not all key­
boards have this feature, but it’s a cool tool to know about.
Getting Your Groove On: Working 
with Onboard Drum Rhythms
Playing in time is a fundamental part of a good performance. But keeping 
proper, even timing is only part of the process; the act of playing with a good 
feel is a more intangible but still critical element. Musicians use terms like 
groove and in the pocket to describe the act of playing with good feel. Feel 
relates to not only keeping steady time but also to subdividing the time with just 
the right nuance and perfectly in sync with the other musicians. You shouldn’t 
rush (play slightly ahead of) or drag (play behind) the tempo too much or be 
generally unsteady (going back and forth between rushing and dragging).

501
 Chapter 2: Adding Accompaniment, Rhythm Patterns, and Arpeggiation
Book VI
Exploring 
Electronic 
Keyboard 
Technology
Developing that sort of timing against a cold, impersonal metronome click is 
hard. But using preprogrammed drum rhythms can bring you much closer. 
Nowadays, the onboard drum patterns in a keyboard were likely played by a 
real drummer and have a highly nuanced and great feel.
So how do you know whether your keyboard has onboard drums?
	
✓	All arrangers and portable keyboards have onboard drums. Anything 
that has auto-accompaniment includes drums as part of its band.
	
✓	Many high-end home digital pianos include auto-accompaniment as well.
	
✓	Workstation keyboards all include drum programs, so you can write 
your own music with drums grooves.
	
✓	Some stage pianos include preset, play-along drum grooves.
	
✓	Workstations, pro synths, and stage pianos with terms such as Rhythm, 
Rhythm Set, Drum Track, and Drum Pattern likely have this function.
	
Some keyboards (workstations and synths) use an arpeggiator to produce 
drum patterns, so look there for this function (see later in this chapter).
Selecting a drum pattern
An instrument with drums always has a beat ready to go; you don’t have to 
dig through a bunch of menu options or anything special to hear them. Locate 
and press the Start/Stop or Play button, and something will start playing. If it 
doesn’t, try playing a key on the keyboard, and the drums may start with you.
Portable keyboards
Portable keyboards don’t always have auto-accompaniment, but they often 
offer drum grooves. Casio calls them Rhythms; Yamaha calls them Styles.
To select a different drum pattern (my generic term), do the following:
	
1.	Press the Style or Rhythm button.
	
	 Use the + and – buttons to move up or down to the next pattern or to 
scroll through the available patterns one at a time. Or use the numeric 
keypad (if available) to enter the number of a specific pattern you want.
	
	 On these low-end models, the pattern names may appear on the front 
panel, as shown in Figure 2-1. On other models, the names are displayed 
on the screen.

2.	When you’ve selected the desired pattern, press Start/Stop.
Note that you can usually scroll or select another pattern while the drums 
are playing, and it will start on the next downbeat.
Arranger keyboards and high-end digital pianos
Full accompaniment is more than you’re looking for right now. You just want 
to have drums playing along with your keyboard playing, so find the button 
that turns off the rest of the accompaniment (see Figure 2-2). This button may 
be labeled Chords On/Off, Accompaniment On/Off, ACMP On/Off, Arranger 
Mode, and so on. On some Roland arrangers, you need to turn off all the 
Backing Type elements (Style, Song, and USB) until only drums remain. With 
the accompaniment/chords turned off, you can freely select drum patterns 
without calling up a full backing band.

pattern you want. Then press Play.
Higher-end models may present the Styles/Rhythms on multiple buttons, 
with each button representing a category of styles arranged by musical 
genre: Rock, Ballroom, Waltz, World, Jazz/Big-Band, and so on, as shown in 
Figure 2-3. Press the button for the category you like and select the specific 
drum pattern you want from the choices shown on the keyboard’s display 
and then press Play. Note that you can usually scroll or select another pat­
tern while the drums are playing, and it will start on the next downbeat, or 
start of a measure.

Synths and workstations
Synths and workstations don’t generally have full backing accompaniment 
but may have drum grooves set up behind their sounds. Depending on the 
product, the pattern is either created by a small phrase/pattern player or 
by an arpeggiator. Drums are usually incorporated in a multisound mode of 

504
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
some sort, be it a layer, a split, or a combination of both. Korg calls these 
Combinations, Kurzweil calls them Setups, Roland calls them Live Sets, and 
Yamaha calls them Performances.
	
Some Korg models have a feature called a drum track, which is a drum groove 
set up behind their single sounds (called programs). They always have a dedi­
cated front panel button for starting these drum patterns.
Selecting a different drum pattern is a little more complicated in these situa­
tions than for the instruments in the preceding sections. Follow these steps:
	
1.	Go into Edit Mode for the multisound mode your product offers.
	
	 Note that some products have dedicated arpeggiator edit buttons or 
controls available right from the front panel, and you don’t need to go 
into Edit Mode to adjust them.
	
2.	Find the page for the drum pattern (phrase) player or the arpeggiator.
	
3.	Locate the Pattern/Arp number parameter; this number is the cur­
rently assigned drum groove for the sound.
	
4.	Locate and select the pattern you want to use.
	
	 Use the + and – buttons, value dial, or data slider to move up or down to 
the next pattern or to scroll through the available patterns one at a time. 
Use the numeric keypad (if available) to directly enter the number of a 
specific drum/arp pattern you want.
	
5.	When you’ve selected the desired pattern, press Start/Stop or Arp On/Off.
Starting the pattern playing
Generally you press a Start/Stop or Play button and your drums start playing 
right away. That works out well if you want a few bars of drum groove before 
you come in with your playing. But if you want to start playing at the same 
time, pressing the button and getting your hand back to the keyboard in time 
for that first downbeat can be nearly impossible.
	
Workstations and pro synths that use an arpeggiator to create drum patterns 
start only when you touch a key on the keyboard. This setup is necessary 
because an arpeggiator rearranges notes you play to create more complex pat­
terns. So it needs some note trigger to do its thing even when it’s used to 
create a background drum groove.
All keyboards with accompaniment offer a setting called Synchro Start or 
Sync Start. It waits for you to play the first note before it starts the drums or 
accompaniment. So pressing the Synchro Start button (see Figure 2-4) tells 
the drums to be ready to play but to wait for a key to be played to trigger the 
start of the groove. Perfect solution!

Many higher-end keyboards offer the ability to set up a footswitch to perform 
the start/stop function, freeing up your hands to stay on the keyboard. That’s 
a convenient way to do things, but it does involve buying the footswitch 
(they’re always an option). The Synchro Start feature is easier.
Every keyboard that offers rhythms, accompaniment, or arpeggiators has 
some type of tempo control on the front panel, whether that’s up and down/
+ and – buttons, a knob or dial, or a tempo parameter in the display.
	
Many keyboards offer a feature called Tap Tempo, which gives you the ability 
to tap on a button at the BPM you want and set the drum tempo to that input. 
Some keyboards have a dedicated button for this capability, but many use a 
combination of two buttons. When setting the tempo with Tap Tempo, you 
need to tap at least three times to give the keyboard a clear indication of the 
tempo you want. Watch the display; it will indicate when it has changed to the 
new tempo.
Digging into natural drum fills
Every arranger-type keyboard offers controls to select drum fills; some 
models have more than others. Note: Arrangers are specifically designed to 
offer these types of variations and fills to emulate the complete performance 
of a song. If you have a workstation, synth, or stage piano that has some 
drum grooves but no apparent fills, that’s too bad — this is one of the differ­
ences in these types of instruments. Some of the drum patterns may have a 
fill preprogrammed at the end of the phrase, but you can’t make it happen 
whenever you want, and you can’t get rid of it.
	
Check out Track 140 to hear drum fills added to various patterns from a Casio 
keyboard.

506
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
On a fancier arranger keyboard, the drum fill button is separate from the vari­
ations, giving you complete control over what happens. And you may have 
more than one drum fill to select from.
Experiment with pressing the Fill button at different times within a measure 
to hear how the drum fill differs. The earlier in a bar you press it, the more 
drum fill you get.
	
Listen to Track 141 to hear various drum fills added to patterns from a Korg 
keyboard.
	
If you press the Fill button very close to the end of the bar, you may not hear a 
fill at all because the keyboard barely plays the fill before going back to the 
pattern. Press it too late, and you actually get a full measure (or more) of fill 
on the next bar.
Using fills to transition to a new variation is so common that most arrangers 
have a button called Auto-Fill that automatically adds a fill when you press a 
new Variation button. With that function turned on, you don’t need to press 
as many buttons during performance.
	
Roland and Yamaha arrangers don’t have dedicated fill-in buttons. Pressing 
the currently playing Variation button again produces a drum fill; pressing a 
different variation button produces a fill when Auto-Fill is turned on.
Incorporating intros
An intro is a beginning phrase that starts off a song and leads into the first 
section. With drums only, these patterns don’t seem all that different from 
the main groove. They become important when you use the full accompani­
ment, providing some interesting parts for the chords you play.
Many arrangers offer a special type of intro called a count-in. This four-beat 
click sets up the tempo and gives you a reference for what it sounds and feels 
like. This feature is similar to what happens in an actual band when the drum­
mer counts off by clicking her sticks to give everyone something to follow. 
Look for it in your keyboard; it may appear on the panel or be a dedicated 
Intro variation.
Playing with Accompaniment
The concept of using auto-accompaniment is simple: You play some notes on 
the lower range of your keyboard, and that tells the system to start playing 
some backing music in the key you gave it. You choose the style of music it 
plays from the choices presented on the front panel.

507
 Chapter 2: Adding Accompaniment, Rhythm Patterns, and Arpeggiation
Book VI
Exploring 
Electronic 
Keyboard 
Technology
The result is the sound of a full band playing, giving you a professional backing 
track that you’re in complete control over. You’ve moved up from being a solo 
pianist to being the leader of an ever-changing cast of musicians who can play 
any song in any style of music you need. All you need to do is pick the style of 
music and provide the band with some chords to follow.
Sound too good to be true? It’s actually a marvel of technology; inside, your 
keyboard is doing some pretty amazing computational stuff, but as the 
player, your job couldn’t be simpler. The following sections lay out what’s 
really going on.
How auto-accompaniment works
Playing with accompaniment usually means you have a split keyboard, with 
the lower range (left hand) dedicated to playing notes/chords to trigger the 
accompaniment and the right hand having a live sound (or two) to play your 
melodies with. Some arrangers and digital pianos have a full-play mode, 
where you play acoustic piano with two hands and the keyboard uses your 
two-handed playing to determine the chords.
Accompaniment uses styles or rhythms — collections of MIDI-based music tracks 
that play various instrument sounds to produce the sound of a backing band. 
They’ve been played and recorded by skilled musicians to faithfully reproduce 
various musical styles. Some are written to sound generic so that you can play 
any song within that genre of music, and others are very specific re-creations of 
a famous song.
The unique thing about the accompaniment “engine” is that it can adapt these 
parts for any chord you give it, changing the notes within the pattern to fit the 
various root tones and chord qualities in music (major, minor, diminished, aug­
mented, and so on). This adaptability is how auto-accompaniment differs from a 
prerecorded backing track, which rigidly plays back the exact notes you played 
to create the part. Accompaniment is interactive — able to change to any chord 
you play the instant you play it.
Starting a pattern playing
As mentioned earlier, the patterns that make up the accompaniment backing 
have various names: Casio and Roland call them Rhythms; Keytron, Korg, and 
Yamaha call them Styles.
	
Simple portable keyboards don’t always have full auto-accompaniment, so look 
for a button labeled Chords, Accompaniment On/Off, ACMP On/Off, Arranger 
Mode, and so on. These options indicate that you have full accompaniment 
parts, not just drums.

508
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Here’s how to get a pattern playing:
	
1.	Press the Styles or Rhythm button.
	
2.	Make sure the Chord/Accomp button is on.
	
3.	Play a low C on the keyboard to start the pattern playing.
	
	 If you feel comfortable, try playing a C triad (C-E-G) instead. If the music 
doesn’t start, press the Start/Stop or Play button while you play the note 
or chord.
	
	 Accompaniment needs you to play a chord to tell the players what key and 
what chord type you want them to play (C major, F minor, and so on). 
So if you just press Start/Stop or Play, the drums will start without the 
rest of the band.
	
4.	With the music playing, select some other patterns and listen to how 
the music and parts change.
	
	 No need to play another chord for now. Just hear how the parts sound 
for various selections. For simple models, you can use the + and – but­
tons to move up or down to the next pattern or to scroll through the 
available patterns one at a time. Or use the numeric keypad (if available) 
to directly enter the number of a specific pattern you want.
	
On low-end models, the pattern names may appear on the front panel. On other 
models, the names are displayed on the screen. Higher-end models present the 
Styles/Rhythms on multiple buttons, with each button representing a category 
of styles arranged by musical genre — Pop & Rock, Ballroom, World, Swing & 
Jazz, and so on.
	
Listen to Track 142 to hear various styles being played using a simple C triad.
Breaking down an accompaniment pattern
An accompaniment pattern usually has the following elements:
	
✓	Drums: Drums include the traditional drum kit, with bass drum, snare, 
hi-hat, cymbals, and so on, playing a beat.
	
✓	Percussion: This element includes things such as tambourine, cowbell, 
shakers, congas/timbales/bongos, triangle, and other hand percussion, 
providing extra color to the rhythm.
	
✓	Bass: Bass presents the low notes that play some sort of rhythmic, 
moving series of notes. It may be an electric, acoustic (upright), or synth 
bass sound, depending on the style of music.
	
✓	Chordal part(s): Chordal parts are often a keyboard sound (acoustic or 
electric piano, organ, clav, and so on.) and possibly some strummed 
guitar parts (acoustic or electric). Having a few tracks of this sort is 
common (just as a band may have multiple players).

509
 Chapter 2: Adding Accompaniment, Rhythm Patterns, and Arpeggiation
Book VI
Exploring 
Electronic 
Keyboard 
Technology
	
✓	Other sustained parts: These options include string, vocal, and synth 
pad sounds — sustained chords for additional interest and sound variety.
	
✓	Background melodic figures: These can be string lines, brass and wood­
wind melodies, synth patterns and arpeggiations, and guitar licks.
Every part will not always be playing; parts may come in and out depending 
on a number of settings and factors, such as which variation you’re using and 
the taste of the pattern programmer. In general, an arranger keyboard uses 
up to 12 parts for these patterns, plus the live sounds that you can play on 
the keyboard along with the accompaniment.
	
Track 143 illustrates a style broken down into its separate elements or tracks.
Feeding the band the chord changes: 
Chord triggering
You have to play chords to tell the accompaniment “engine” what to do. All 
arrangers and portable keyboards offer a couple of ways of playing chords, 
some simpler than others.
Part of the fun of auto-accompaniment is how it can help fill out your musical 
performance when your skills aren’t as well developed. Each brand offers an 
easy method of chord triggering, which doesn’t require you to know what 
specific notes make up a particular chord. The following sections break down 
two methods for this process: Casio’s and everyone else’s.
	
These easy chord methods don’t support the ability to play diminished, aug­
mented, or suspended chords. You have to use a fingered mode instead; see 
the later section “Playing the chords yourself” for details.
Casio
Here’s how to trigger easy chords for Casio keyboards:
	
1.	Press and hold the Chords/Accomp On/Off button until 
CHORDS:Fingered or F1 shows up in the display.
	
2.	Use the + or – button to change the value to CHORDS: CC (meaning 
Casio Chord).
	
	 Now whenever you play a single note in the lower part of the keyboard, 
you’ll produce a major triad.
	
3.	To change the kind of chord, press the root tone and one or more 
higher keys.

510
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
	
	 To play a minor triad, press the root tone you want (C, for example) 
and any other note (white or black) above it. Check out Figure 2-5 for 
an example. To play a dominant seventh or minor seventh chord, press 
your desired root tone and any two or three notes, respectively, above it.

The other guys
Korg and Roland arrangers don’t wake up with their easy chord method 
selected (Yamaha is ready to go!), so you need to turn that on before you con­
tinue. Here’s how:
	
✓	Korg
	
1.	Press the Global mode button, followed by Mode Preferences.
	
	For most models, this sequence takes you where you need to go, 
but note that some models locate the easy chord function in the 
Style Play mode, Split Tab.
	
2.	Select the Style tab/page and choose the parameter Chord 
Recognition.
	
3.	Change the value to One Finger.
	
✓	Roland
	
1.	Press the Menu button, followed by Arranger Settings.
	
2.	Select the Type parameter.
	
3.	Change the value to Easy.
Now you’re ready to trigger chords the easy way!
	
✓	Major triad: Play a single note in the lower part of the keyboard.

Listen to Track 145 to hear this simple chord progression in several styles.
	
The fingered method is self-explanatory: You play the full chords with your left 
hand and the system reads them and produces the backing parts. So you need to 
know how to play chords fairly well to use this method successfully. Depending 
on the manufacturer, this form of chord playing is referred to as Fingered (Casio 
and Korg), Multi Finger (Yamaha), and Standard (Roland) and is the default 
method for chord recognition for all keyboards when powered on.
Mixing the sound of the band
Mixing a musical recording involves adjusting the volume balance of each of the 
instruments, deciding which speaker they come out of (called panning), and pos­
sibly adjusting or changing the effects that are being used. Mid- and higher-priced 
arrangers give you access to these functions in addition to letting you decide 
which sound is being used for each part. Taking control of these aspects of your 
backing band allows you to make the sound exactly the way you want it.

How do you know whether your keyboard has this capability? Look for a 
feature/parameter called the Mixer; it may be a dedicated button or a page 
within the Style/Rhythm Play mode (look in your manual, on the front panel, 
or within the menus). Figure 2-9 shows some example screens of mixers as 
presented in a few arrangers.

A skilled musician/producer has already volume-balanced all the styles and 
rhythms in your keyboard, so you probably don’t need to make big changes. 
But two common scenarios require a little adjustment here and there:
	
✓	Slightly increasing or decreasing the volume of a backing instrument: 
Perhaps you’re having a little problem hearing the bass part clearly 
enough, or the string lines stand out a little too much for your taste. 
These fixes are small; you’re not trying to redo the whole band mix.
	
✓	Turning off a part: This process is called muting a part or channel.
To change the volume of a part (it may be called a Part or a Track), you select 
it, use the interface controls to increase or decrease the volume parameter 
value, and then resave the style/rhythm.
To turn off a part entirely, you may have two options. If your mixer design has 
a dedicated Mute parameter, you can use that parameter to turn off the part. 
If it doesn’t have a Mute, simply turn the part volume all the way down to 00. 
Again, be sure to resave the Style/Rhythm.
	
Some parts play only during a specific variation in a style or rhythm. So be 
sure to check all the variations your keyboard offers to find and be able to 
hear them.

514
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Letting the Keyboard Make 
the Choices for You
Arranger keyboards and high-end digital pianos are very advanced ­instruments; 
they’re actually pretty complicated to even the average tech-minded electronic 
keyboardist. The front panel has so many buttons, and you seem to need an 
extra set of hands just to operate all the features. To counteract that, the 
instrument designers build in a variety of timesaving functions to automate 
these choices. They often set up a bunch of options for you so you can quickly 
make the sound and setting features you need, and they offer features that 
you can configure for yourself to do the same. The following sections give you 
a few to check out.
Taking advantage of one-touch settings
Most mid- and upper-end arrangers offer three or four sounds for live playing 
on the keyboard. Most are for the right hand part of the key range, with maybe 
one to layer with the left hand while triggering the chords for the accompani­
ment. These sounds aren’t always all active at the same time; you usually 
choose between them to vary your melody playing at different parts of the 
song. For example, you may switch sounds (like starting a melody with a flute 
and changing to trumpet at the bridge) or layer a second sound on top of the 
first (like adding strings behind your piano).
To extend these possibilities even further, you can save and recall sets of 
these sounds as part of your accompaniment. Called Single Touch (Korg) or 
One Touch Settings (Roland and Yamaha), these buttons instantly recall all 
four sounds, with their volume, panning, effects, and key ranges all prede­
cided, and some fancy extras thrown in. If your keyboard has this feature, try 
it out to see how easily it recalls a wide variety of sounds that have all been 
chosen to work with the current style or rhythm you’re using.
Advanced models from Casio have an extended version of this function 
called a Registration. Along with saving the selection of live sounds, these 
one-touch settings can also recall the rhythm pattern, tempo, and some other 
cool extras. But they don’t have to change any of the accompaniment parts 
when selecting a new rhythm; a Global Mode setting can disable that, so they 
only will recall the live part sounds and effects and so on just like the other 
brands offer.
	
Yamaha also has a Registration feature, which recalls sounds and other set­
tings. It differs from the One Touch settings in that it has nothing to do with 
the accompaniment memories. So you may end up choosing some sounds that 
don’t go well with the style of music you’re playing.

Diving into the music database
As you develop a large repertoire of songs you can play, remembering what style 
or rhythm, tempo, and other settings to use for each song becomes confusing. 
Plus, setting all those things up takes time; no keyboardist wants to leave the 
audience waiting while he pokes around the front panel of his keyboard.
Professional arrangers take care of this problem with yet another type of memory, 
called a SongBook (Korg), Music Assistant/Performance List (Roland), or Music 
Finder (Yamaha). This feature stores all the needed settings for a specific song 
(sounds, accompaniment, tempo, effects), along with text reminders such as 
the key you like to play the song in, lyrics, other text notes, and more. It’s a 
database, so you can search for songs by title, artist, genre, and many other 
tags much like you can in your computer media player. The keyboard comes 
with many songs already defined, and you can add more of your own and 
download and share entries with other users around the world. Figure 2-10 
shows some example screens for this feature.

Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Using Some Fancy Extras
But wait, there’s more! Modern arrangers have a number of other cool features 
that help your playing sound fuller and fancier without any extra work on 
your part.
Adding harmony to your melodies
Block chords is a style of playing right hand melodies where the melody is 
harmonized with additional notes below it to form full chord voicings, using 
smooth voice-leading. Organ players often use this technique, as did jazz pianist 
George Shearing, and it’s popular in jazz and dance big-band arranging within 
their sax section writing.
And you can too; it’s just a button-push away. Look on your front panel for 
a button labeled Ensemble (Korg), Harmony/Echo (Yamaha), or Melody 
Intelligence (Roland). Turn it on and then try the following:
	
1.	Set up your accompaniment to play.
	
2.	Start the accompaniment with a simple C major chord.
	
3.	Play a single note with your right hand; notice it’s playing a whole 
chord.
	
4.	Move around to some other notes while keeping the left hand chord 
the same and listen for how the sound changes.
	
5.	Hold a C note with your right hand and change your left hand chord 
to an F major.
	
	 Notice how the melody (right hand) part changes; it’s now adding har­
mony using notes that match an F chord.
	
6.	Change your left hand chord to an A minor and hear the change.
	
Your keyboard may have different settings for the type of harmony it cre­
ates when using this feature. Read your owner’s manual and explore all the 
possibilities.
	
Listen to Track 146 to hear examples of auto-harmony.

Hitting the chord pads
Some arrangers offer some buttons called pads or multi pads that you can use 
to tap out drum beats and trigger sound effects or even phrases of music. 
This setting is a fun way of adding more sounds and parts to your playing 
without having to worry about playing the right keys on the keyboard. These 
chord pads have various names and operate in a variety of ways:
	
✓	Momentary/Hit: Touch the pad and a sound triggers once. This option 
is good for playing a single drum sound or synth sound effect (such as 
a zap).
	
✓	Once: A musical phrase plays one time and then stops. You can use this 
method for something like a harp arpeggio or flamenco guitar strum 
flourish.
	
✓	Looped: A musical phrase or sound keeps playing endlessly (in time 
with your accompaniment parts) until you turn it off. This function can 
add an additional percussion groove or a cool synth arpeggiated phrase 
(or even trigger the sound of endless audience applause).
Each style and rhythm has its own saved settings for the pads, so take some 
time and explore them.
	
Track 147 demonstrates some chord pad applications.
Exploring Arpeggiation
The word arpeggiate means to play the notes of a chord in a broken fashion, 
one at a time. It comes from the Italian word arpeggiare, which means “to play 
on a harp,” which was a common way of outlining the harmony or chords of a 
piece of music.
Practicing arpeggios is an essential part of serious piano study because it 
builds technique and the ability to cleanly go up and down the full range of 
the keyboard.
	
Listen to Track 148 to hear examples of arpeggiated chords played on the piano.

518
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Not every person who ever wanted to play a keyboard develops that level of 
technique, though, so in the late ’60s, organ manufacturers added a simple 
form of auto-accompaniment that took the held notes of a chord and played 
them one after another to produce arpeggios. Though your image of those 
big console home theater organs may be of hokey show tunes and cheesy 
drum grooves, this feature is how Pete Townsend created the keyboard part 
for the Who song “Eminence Front” on a Yamaha E-70 home organ.
The first synthesizer to include an arpeggiator was the Roland Jupiter 4, 
released in 1978. Many others followed, and arpeggiators were quite popular 
in instruments through the mid-’80s. After falling out of favor for a period of 
time, they came back with a vengeance, with many new features and capabili­
ties. Many of today’s synths, workstations, and software synthesizers include 
arpeggiators, as do computer software sequencers and digital audio work‑
stations (DAWs).
Looking at some arp examples
	
In the most basic scenario, an arpeggiator takes the notes you hold on the key­
board and plays them one after the other, in a direction that you can choose 
(up, down, or up and down). Figure 2-11 (Track 149) shows a simple C major 
triad that produces various repeating patterns when held and driven by 
an arpeggiator.
Figure 2-11: 
A basic arp 
pattern.
Illustration by Jerry Kovarsky
In this example, holding down a three-note chord can produce these various pat­
terns based on the three most common settings for the note direction, or order.
Which notes you play on the keyboard doesn’t matter; the arpeggiator obedi­
ently plays them back for you over and over. A common use of this function 
in many of the songs mentioned earlier in the chapter is to just hold a single 
note or an octave to produce a pulsating rhythm or alternating bass line

Moving to a more complex example, playing a two-handed chord like the one 
shown in Figure 2-12 (Track 150) gets you a more complex arp pattern. A cool 
aspect of such a running arp pattern is that it doesn’t have to repeat at the bar 
line of your music, so using an odd number of notes produces a less regular-
sounding repeating pattern than using an even number of notes. Holding down 
a five-note chord creates the pattern in Figure 2-12.

Of course, you don’t have to hold down the same chord all the time. By changing 
chords, you make the arp pattern sound more interesting and less repetitive.
Another technique you hear in a lot of music is the player pressing notes 
down to trigger the arp for a little bit, letting go to introduce space or rests, 
and then playing some notes again.
	
Listen to Track 151 to hear various examples of changing chords and using 
space to make simple up/down arpeggiated patterns more interesting.
	
Early modular synths, many analog synths, and some modern keyboards have 
a function called a step sequencer, which many people confuse with an arpeggi­
ator. A step sequencer allows you to define the pitch for each step of a pattern 
and then always plays back that pitch. The only interaction with the keyboard 
may be to allow you to transpose the whole pattern to another note or key 
from the keyboard. But the step sequencer is a pre-programmed riff, or pat­
tern; it’s not changing chord qualities or the span of the note intervals based 
on what you play on the keyboard, so the riff doesn’t really change. The result 
may sound the same to your ears, but the step sequencer isn’t as interactive 
as the arpeggiator. To its advantage, it can produce more complex patterns. 
A step sequencer was used for Pink Floyd’s famous “On the Run” synth 
­pattern, for example.

Exploring More Arpeggiator Features
If all an arpeggiator could do was play back the notes you hold on the keyboard, 
the effect would be cool but would get boring and predictable pretty quickly. 
And other than using them on different sounds, all arpeggiated parts would 
sound much the same. Thankfully, arpeggiators have gained many new features 
over time and grown to be very complex and creative. The following sections 
take you on a tour of the most common features of a modern arpeggiator.
Extending the range
In its most basic setting, an arpeggiator just repeats the exact notes you 
play, over and over again. A range parameter gives you a choice of how many 
octaves to repeat the pattern of notes, usually expressed as one, two, three, 
and sometimes even four octaves. By setting a range parameter, you can tell 
the arpeggiator to play the original notes and then to play those same notes 
again up an octave, and yet again up another octave, and so on.
	
Track 152 presents various patterns being played first at one octave and then 
expanded to two, three, and four octaves. The examples have some effects and 
filter sweeps included to sound more interesting — as they’d be used in a song.
Changing the timing/speed
Of course, any arp pattern is being played in some rhythm, and they usually 
are very simple timings — perhaps eighth notes against the tempo. All arpeg­
giators give you some choices for this timing resolution. As you increase the 
resolution, or subdivision, of the beat, the arp pattern plays back faster and 
sounds busier. But it’s always in time with your music. Common timing options 
can range from a whole note per step down to sixteenth notes, various triplet 
timings, and even 32nd notes.
	
If all your sound is coming from one keyboard, this timing happens automati­
cally. If you want to use multiple instruments or a hardware keyboard and 
sounds running from your computer, you need to connect them via MIDI and 
set the MIDI synchronization between the devices. One device will produce 
what is called the Master Clock, and all the other devices will be set to listen to 
this external MIDI Clock.
	
Check out Track 153 to hear a pattern being played along with a drum rhythm 
and then switched between various timing settings.

Getting into the swing of things
Swing is a way of playing a rhythm where the notes aren’t equally timed; 
when you play two eighth notes, the first note is longer than the second, 
producing a pleasing, lopsided feel. You may have heard the term related to 
a style of jazz music played in the late ’30s and ’40s. In fact, the swing pulse 
of rhythm is a core component of jazz playing. But it’s also used in boogie-
woogie, country, blues and rock shuffles, and hip-hop music.
More modern arpeggiators offer swing as an adjustable parameter (sometimes 
called shuffle), so your pattern can go from a very even, straight feel to this 
cooler, more lopsided feel. Swing may be presented as a percentage or a strength 
value, but increasing it makes the relationship between each group of two notes 
more irregular, with the first note getting longer and the second getting shorter 
to make up the difference.
In general, swing rhythms have a triplet feel, where the quarter note is divided 
into three parts. The first note holds for the first two triplets and the third 
is the last triplet. In print music, the rhythm is still written as straight eighth 
notes and then just marked as “swing feel” or something similar. Writing 
everything as triplets would make the music difficult to read.
	
Track 154 features a pattern being played straight along with a swung drum 
rhythm (which sounds bad) and then gradually swung to feel better against 
the groove.
	
Higher swing strengths on arpeggio patterns work best with swing/jazz, 
shuffle, 6/8, 12/8, and hip-hop/R & B drum grooves.
Making the notes shorter/longer
Increasing and decreasing the duration of the notes being played is a very 
effective technique in making an arp pattern fit the music or vary as a part 
develops. This parameter may be called length, duration, or gate time in vari­
ous arpeggiators. If you increase the duration to the maximum, the notes will 
play completely connected, or legato.
Hearing the notes being held 
along with the arp
Some arpeggiators can sound the notes being held down along with the gen­
erated notes from the pattern. This feature results in a kind of layered sound, 
where you can hear a chord sustaining while the arp bubbles up beneath it. 

522
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
It’s a great sound and works well as long as your keyboard has enough 
polyphony (ability to generate enough new notes or voices) to keep the chord 
sound sustaining while all the other notes are generated. This parameter is 
called different things by different companies: Often, it’s just keyboard or 
kybd, but Yamaha calls it direct, for example.
Keeping the arp playing without 
holding the keys
If you want the arp pattern to keep repeating for a longer period of time, you 
don’t always need to keep holding the keys. Latch (sometimes called hold) is 
a parameter that keeps the pattern playing based on the note(s) you played 
until you press another key or chord. So you can feed the arp a few notes, let 
go, and let it do its thing while you play another part of the keyboard range or 
another keyboard (or get your audience to clap along). To stop the pattern, 
you can either turn off the latch function or stop the arp.
Adding variety with different patterns
You don’t have to use the same pattern for a whole song. Changing the pat­
tern from section to section can be a great way to add variety to you music. If 
you’re playing a song that has a more traditional form with verses, a chorus, 
a breakdown or solo section, and so on, you can try changing to a subtly 
different pattern for one of the sections and then returning to your original 
pattern later on. Or not. Feel free to experiment and find instances where 
adding some variety is just what you need to keep your music from getting 
too predictable.
Trying Out Some Different Sounds: 
Matching Sounds and Arp Patterns
No keyboard law defines what sounds you can and can’t arpeggiate; feel free 
to experiment away! That said, here are some tips and practical advice for 
matching sounds and arp patterns:
	
✓	Sounds with a fast attack work well at any tempo. If a sound has a 
slower attack and you’re playing at a fast tempo or using a fast timing 
subdivision (sixteenth notes, for example), the results can be kind of 

523
 Chapter 2: Adding Accompaniment, Rhythm Patterns, and Arpeggiation
Book VI
Exploring 
Electronic 
Keyboard 
Technology
sluggish and unclear. The sound just doesn’t have enough time to speak 
before the next note is being triggered. In this case, you need to adjust 
the amp envelope attack to a faster value.
	
✓	Sounds with long releases don’t work as well. You have to adjust the 
amp envelope release (see Book VI Chapter 3) to a shorter value. Soft 
string ensembles, spacey vocal pads, and other atmospheric sounds 
typically need this type of edit to work.
	
✓	Most synth sounds are great to use. People associate arpeggiators with 
synths, so this pairing is a match made in synthesizer heaven. However, 
swirly sound effects and evolving imaginative synth sounds may not 
work that well, especially at faster tempos/timing.
	
✓	Plucked and short decay sounds are good choices. Consider guitars; 
other plucked string instruments (including ethnic sounds); mallets and 
tuned percussion; and keyboard sounds such as piano, electric piano, 
clav, and harpsichord.
	
✓	Short noises and non-pitched percussion work well. Not everything 
has to be about chords and harmony; sometimes a unique arpeggiated 
sound effect adds a nice texture to a part.
	
Be sure to match the arp range to the sound used. Some sounds don’t sound 
good at their extreme ranges (either at the top or the bottom), so be sure to 
pick your trigger note range carefully and consider how many octaves to set 
the range to. Judge where the sweet spot is for a given sound or arp pattern.
Adding Fun Sound and Effects Tweaks
Sometimes just finding the right arp pattern, sound, and chord(s) is enough 
for a song. Mix it well, and you’ll be happy. But often arpeggiated parts get to 
sound a bit static and predictable when you just leave them running on their 
own. So varying any or all the parameters discussed earlier in this chapter 
will help your music greatly.
But wait, there’s more! Here are a few cool tips to further enhance your arp-ing 
adventures:
	
✓	Sweep the filter as the pattern plays. This move is a classic. Many musi­
cians and producers use a sound that has a low frequency oscillator 
(LFO) slowly modulating the filter cutoff, so this effect happens auto­
matically. Book VI Chapter 3 talks about these parameters.

524
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
	
✓	Pan the sound back and forth as the pattern plays. Arpeggiated parts 
sound great when they move back and forth between the speakers. Try 
making the panning cycle different from the pattern length so it doesn’t 
seem to repeat so regularly. A slow pan for a fast arp pattern sounds 
great, as does a faster pan on a slower part. Using an LFO to modulate 
amplifier pan position makes this task easy.
	
✓	Put a delay effect on your sound. Timed delays work wonderfully 
combined with an arp pattern. Slower arp patterns with shorter note 
durations leave space so you can hear the delays. Don’t let the delay 
regenerate too many repeats because that can get in the way of your 
new notes. And be sure the delay is mixed back a little so it’s supporting 
echoes, not just a sloppy wash of notes. Listen to The Edge, the guitarist 
from U2; he’s a master of this effect, even though he (not an arpeggiator) 
is playing the parts.
	
✓	Let go of your notes once in a while, especially when using delays. 
Many arpeggiators have a latch or hold function, which keeps the notes 
playing even when you lift your hands off the keys. Turn that off so you 
can be in control of introducing rests and space into the pattern as you 
want. Going manual also lets you use delays with more repeats or longer 
repetition times. Feed the keyboard a chord, let a few notes arpeggiate, 
and then let go and just listen to the stream of echoes that follows. 
Repeat and enjoy.

ost of today’s electronic keyboards offer some form of recording, so 
you can capture and then listen back to your playing, compose and 
create a complete musical production, and do all steps in between. It’s pretty 
amazing to realize that what used to take tens of thousands of dollars of 
complicated and specialized equipment, a room designed for recording, and 
a group of musicians with expensive instruments is something you can now 
achieve within the humble keyboard that sits in front of you.
Look at your keyboard; you probably see the word(s) recorder, sequencer, 
music recorder, song, or something similar to indicate that it has some sort of 
recording function. Even easier: A button labeled Record or REC is a sure sign 
you have this capability.
In this chapter, you discover the basics of both audio and MIDI recording, 
how the techniques differ, and why you’d choose one form over the other. 
You get a basic overview of how to do these types of recording — at least 
enough to help you when it comes time to crack open the manual for your 
specific model. Plus you’ll see how to get your music out of your keyboard 
and onto your computer and then how to share it with family, friends, and 
fans around the world.

526
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
This chapter also talks about editing your sounds. Most keyboards offer 
some ability to shape their sounds and even make new sounds of your own. 
Your keyboard may be called a digital piano or an arranger, but all electronic 
keyboards are actually a type of synthesizer at their roots. They generate 
tones called waveforms, which are molded and shaped to sound like the 
instruments you recognize (and some you don’t!).
Some keyboards are preset synthesizers; they offer you no apparent control 
over the sounds they provide. Most others offer some degree of variability, 
from slight tweaks to make sounds brighter or darker to the ability to have 
the sound keep ringing when you take your finger off the key.
You’ll see how sounds are made and how you can modify the sounds to 
meet your taste and needs. If the thought of editing sounds conjures visions 
of some mad scientist plugging wires into a large panel of jacks or a DJ sur­
rounded by boxes with blinking lights, this chapter will show you that editing 
sounds can be much easier than you may think.
Audio Recording versus MIDI Recording
As an electronic keyboardist, you have two forms of recording technology 
available: audio recording and MIDI recording. They’re very different from 
one another, each with certain advantages, covered in the following sections.
Recording with analog and digital audio
For most people, a recording is something you listen to — a record, a cas­
sette (who remembers those?), a CD, or an MP3. These are all products of 
audio recording, the act of capturing the sound of singers, players, and instru­
ments and storing them on a device capable of reproducing them whenever 
you want. Capturing the sound is the key distinction of audio recording — the 
actual sound as you hear it, frozen in time for all to hear and enjoy.
Audio recording comes in two flavors: analog and digital. Both use some type 
of device to convert the live sound waves produced by the player/instrument 
into a signal. The most common is a microphone (shown in Figure 3-1), though 
electronic instruments can hook up to the recorder directly, and a keyboard 
with recording capability can do its own recording.
Analog recording gear converts the sound into a voltage or electrical signal 
that can be routed through various devices and then usually stored onto 
magnetic tape. (Figure 3-2 shows a common analog studio recorder.) Analog 
recording was the only form of recording for decades and is still used in 
­professional recording studios that favor its warmth and tonal qualities.

Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
For the vast majority of users, the development of digital technology and 
computers has paved the way for digital recording. In digital recording, the 
sound is converted into 1s and 0s (a kind of electronic code) and can be 
stored onto a hard drive, digital storage media such as an SD card (the same 
kind your camera and smartphone use), and mobile devices. The sound can 
be run through other devices before being converted into the digital format 
or be manipulated later in the digital format to produce the same results. 
Most standalone recorders — either small handheld devices (see Figure 3-3), 
desktop-sized studios in a box, or larger systems — employ digital recording, 
as do all computer-based recording packages (commonly called digital audio 
workstations; see Figure 3-4).

Digital recording has many functional advantages over analog recording, 
mostly involving editing. To rearrange a song, for example, tape has to be 
cut and joined back together, which is a difficult task to do accurately. Digital 
data can easily and freely be copied, pasted, and manipulated.

Making sense of MIDI recording
MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a digital language that electronic 
instruments and devices use to speak to each other. It communicates infor­
mation such as what key you’ve pressed on a keyboard, how hard you played 
it, how long you held it, and so on. Unlike audio recording, it captures only 
the gestures that produce the sound, not the sound itself. Therefore, you 
can’t listen back to a MIDI performance without it being connected to and 
replaying a MIDI device live. That device may be a hardware instrument you 
can see or a software instrument running on your computer (or phone!), but 
it’s being played in real time as you listen back.
The beauty of MIDI as a recording method is that it’s infinitely editable. 
Figure 3-5 shows a screen shot of MIDI data in what’s called an event edit list. 
You can select, edit, copy, or delete each MIDI event in this edit list as you 
want. Hit a bad note or don’t like the sound you played? No problem; erase it 
or, better yet, change it to the right note/another sound! Didn’t play with the 
best timing? You can fix that later. Can’t play something fast enough? Record 
it slowly and then speed up the playback later; your recorder will now play 
the MIDI device at whatever tempo you set it to. These examples are just a 
taste of the things you can do with MIDI editing.

MIDI sounds like the universal answer to all recording, right? Well, it’s not. 
You can’t capture your singing voice with MIDI, unless you’re some sort of 
MIDI robot. So a live person or an acoustic instrument isn’t going to be able 
to be MIDI-recorded. And eventually, you’re going to want your MIDI record­
ings to be captured as audio so you can listen to them anywhere, away from 
your MIDI gear, and share them with your friends and the world.
Capturing What You Hear As It 
Happens: One-Pass Recording
The most basic form of recording is to capture a performance as it happens. 
Whether it’s one person playing solo on a single instrument, a small group, 
the playback of your electronic keyboard that has drums and accompani­
ment, or a symphony orchestra doesn’t matter. You set up the recording 
system as needed, press record, and it all happens at the same time — in one 
pass. The following sections help you set up one-pass recording for both the 
audio and MIDI approaches.

Tackling audio recording in one pass
The ability to record one complete audio performance from your keyboard 
is becoming a more common feature on many digital pianos, stage pianos, 
arrangers, and workstations. Basically, with this option, anything that can be 
produced by the keyboard all at once can be recorded.
Typically, the keyboard has a USB port that you can connect a memory stick 
or drive to; that’s what the keyboard records the digital audio onto. (Note 
that some workstations and arrangers have an internal hard drive that can 
be used as the recording medium.) The recording is made as a stereo wave 
file (abbreviated as WAV or .wav), which is the most common digital audio 
format for use on computers. Without getting too technical, the settings 
for this wave file will be at the right resolution to be able to listen to on any 
device, to burn a CD from, and to share with anyone you want.
Recording a one-pass audio track doesn’t require a complicated setup:
	
1.	Make sure your keyboard is in the right mode (single sound, multi­
sound, accompaniment playback, or whatever).
	
2.	Choose the audio recording feature.
	
	 This function may be a dedicated button, but you may have to select 
Record and then choose audio as the format. The method of choosing 
varies from product to product; read your owner’s manual.
	
3.	Select where to record to: internal hard drive, USB stick or drive, and 
so on.
	
	 Your owner’s manual will tell you what to do.
	
4.	Press Record or Start and begin playing (or sit back while the 
­keyboards plays).
	
5.	Press Stop when you’ve recorded what you want.
	
	 Your wave file is now on your memory stick or hard drive, ready to be 
listened to, shared, or brought into your computer.
	
One-pass audio recording is a great way to capture your practicing or playing 
so you can listen back to yourself. Hearing your recorded playing once in a 
while is a good idea because it lets you evaluate how you sound and how your 
practicing is progressing. You hear yourself differently this way compared to 
when you’re involved in the act of playing. Plus, it’s a fun way to share your 
music with friends and family or share your child’s progress with others.

532
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Grabbing a one pass MIDI recording
Being able to record one pass of MIDI is even more common than audio 
recording on today’s keyboards. You often don’t even know your recording 
function is MIDI recording; many digital pianos and stage pianos just call it 
a music recorder and don’t bother to explain the technology. On most key­
boards, though, the MIDI recorder is called a sequencer.
Recording a one pass MIDI track is straightforward and simple for live play­
ing. Your keyboard may have a simple Record button and a Start/Stop button, 
or it may have a more complete set of buttons called transport controls as 
shown in Figure 3-6. These controls are copied from the buttons that were 
used to operate tape recorders and digital recorders.
	
Figure 3-6: 
Recorder 
transport 
controls.
	
Here’s how to make a one pass MIDI recording:
	
1.	Select the sound you want to use.
	
2.	Choose the recording feature.
	
	 This capability may be a dedicated button, or you may have to select 
Record and then choose MIDI as the format. It varies from product to 
product, so check out your owner’s manual.
	
3.	Press Record or Start.
	
	 Note: Some products don’t start recording the moment you press 
Record. They go into a record-ready state and usually start a click 
rhythm so you can listen to the current tempo to get ready to play. You 
typically must press Start or Play before it begins recording. (For some 
products, you start recording from this wait mode the moment you play 
a note.)
	
	 In general, MIDI recorders default to playing a click when recording so 
that the recorded data can be matched up to bars and beats for later 
editing. So you should set the tempo of the click/recording before you 
start. You can easily do so during the record-ready time by pressing 
Record and using the front panel tempo controls to set the speed.

4.	When you’re ready, press the Start or Play button, or just play away!
	
5.	Press Stop when you’re finished.
	
6.	Relocate to the beginning of the recording.
	
	 For some keyboards, you do so by pressing Stop twice. For others, you 
have to hold the Rewind button.
	
7.	Press Play to listen to your recording.
	
	 If you don’t like what you played, you can just do it over by pressing 
Record (and perhaps Start or Play) and trying again. You can rerecord as 
many times as you want; each new recording erases the previous one.
	
Most workstations, higher-end portables, and mid-to-high-end arrangers have 
to be in sequencer mode to do any MIDI recording. For these products, you 
have to set up a sound on the first recording part or track and often have to 
copy it with its effects to sound like it did when you were just playing the 
sound. You may have a shortcut for this, or it may require a set of steps. Look 
to your owner’s manual for more info and read the following section.
Recording Multitrack MIDI
If you want to record more than one sound via MIDI (either at the same time 
or by building up parts one at a time), you need to use the full sequencer 
of your keyboard. Perhaps you want to record your keyboard playing along 
with an accompanying drum groove or record all the backing parts from the 
auto-accompaniment features of your digital piano or arranger. You may want 
to add more parts to your solo piano performance to make a full production 
from it. All these situations require you to create different parts, one for each 
distinct sound or part that is playing.
The design/layout and capabilities of each product’s onboard sequencer 
(and computer-based sequencers/digital audio workstations (DAWs) is 
somewhat different, but the following sections explain the concepts; you 
can then go to your product’s owner’s manual and support documentation 
and videos for more specific help.
Setting up your session
The basic concept of any multitrack recorder/sequencer is that for each 
sound you want to record, you use a separate track. Think of each track as 
another instrument or player that’s going to provide a part for your song. 
Each track is set to a different MIDI channel; this way, each instrument gets 
only the notes, controller information, and program change meant for it.

534
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
You choose a sound (such as piano, drums, bass, and so on) for each track 
and can adjust the volume and the panning for the track (which speaker it’s 
coming out of, left or right). Note that you can adjust all these parameters 
again later, when you mix your song (discussed later in the chapter).
The most confusing part of setting up for recording in a sequencer has to 
do with assigning the effects used for each sound. When you play a sound 
by itself in single sound or multisound mode, that sound has already been 
programmed to use specific effects — certainly some reverb and quite pos­
sibly some coloration effect like chorus or phase shifting, with very specific 
settings for each effect. Guitars may have distortion and so on. When you 
first call up a sound on a track in a sequencer, though, it likely doesn’t have 
any of these effects assigned, so it sounds very different and very plain. You 
must reassign, or reconfigure, the effects yourself with those exact settings to 
get the sound back to the way it is in the sound mode. To do so you need to 
understand the structure of your keyboard’s effects system.
Some effects are commonly global, meaning every sound in the sequencer or 
song can share the same effect. These overarching effects are called master 
effects or system effects; they may be limited to certain choices (the two most 
common being some form of reverb and chorus), or you may be able to freely 
choose what effects go in these master locations. Each track or sound has a 
send amount parameter to run it into each master effect, so you can decide 
on a sound-by-sound basis how much effect to give. If your model always pre-
assigns the master effects, the parameter may even say Reverb Amount and 
Chorus Amount.
Other effects are configured on a per-track or per-part basis. This design is 
called an insert effect or insertion effect because you place it in-line with a 
given track or part such that it’s not available to all parts. This configuration 
usually applies to the more special, colorful types of effects such as deeper 
modulation effects, distortion, and rotary speaker. It doesn’t have a send 
amount because you choose how much of the effect to hear with a wet/dry or 
mix parameter within the effect itself. (Dry is the unaffected sound; wet is the 
sound with effect added in.) Note: Each product is different, but keyboards 
usually have a limited number of these insert effects, so every track/sound 
can’t have its own effect.
	
You don’t always have to go to the hassle of figuring out what each sound’s 
effects are and manually reprogramming them in the sequencer mode; many 
instruments have a Copy With Effects or Copy Effects From Sound menu com­
mand you can use when assigning a sound to a track. This may be a one-step 
process for all effects — master and insert — or you may have to do it sepa­
rately for the master effects and the insert effects. Look for this type of helper 
to get your first sound/first track set up so it sounds the way it should.

Recording the first track
You’ve picked the sound you want to record first and you’ve copied back 
the effects it uses so it sounds good when you play the keyboard. Just follow 
these steps to record:
	
1.	Press Record or Rec.
	
	 For some keyboards, this function gives you a count-in of four clicks, 
and then you’re recording. For other keyboards, you need to press Play 
or Start while in this record-ready mode to start actual recording.
	
	 You’re working with MIDI recording, so the tempo doesn’t matter; you 
can always change it later. You may want to set it a little bit slower so 
you can concentrate and play cleanly for now.
	
2.	Press Stop when you’re finished playing.
	
3.	Relocate to the beginning of the recording.
	
	 The earlier section “Creating a one pass MIDI recording” talks about this.
	
4.	Press Play to listen to your recording.
	
	 Repeat Steps 1 through 3 to record over it if you don’t like what you hear.
Adding more tracks
Your first track/part sounds great; time to move on to the next. Here’s how to 
record subsequent tracks:
	
1.	On the interface for your sequencer, find how to select Track 2.
	
	 You didn’t have to think about track selection to record the first track, 
but now you need to change to a different track so you don’t record over 
your first part and lose that perfect performance!
	
2.	Choose a sound for this second part.
	
	 Remember that it will probably sound dry at first. Don’t use one of the 
copy commands related to effects at this time. If you do, you’ll likely 
change the effects that your first track uses.
	
3.	Go to Track 2’s send parameters and dial in a little reverb and/or the 
other master effect to suit your needs.
	
	 Remember that you can always add to and improve this mix later. Just 
get the sound close enough so you feel comfortable playing it.
	
4.	If needed, reassign or copy the desired insert effect (which may be 
called Insert or DSP effect) for Track 2.

Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
	
	 If you want more than just the master effects, determine whether you 
can reassign an insert effect or copy only that effect from the program 
you selected to your second sound. Some products have up to five or 
six insert effects. Your sequencer likely has 16 tracks, but with multiple 
insert effects, you can decide which tracks really need the extra sonic 
help and which can get by with only using the master effects.
	
	 Play the keyboard; you’ll hear this second sound and can judge whether 
you have the effects set up the way you want. As with the master effects, 
don’t worry about getting the sound perfect at this stage. You’ll be 
able to tweak these settings again later when you have all your parts 
recorded.
	
	 With your sound parameters set, practice your new part before recording 
it by pressing Play and playing along with the previous track(s). You don’t 
need to record until you’re comfortable and ready to go.
	
5.	Repeat Steps 1 and 2 in the preceding section to record the part.
	
6.	Relocate to the beginning and press Play to listen to your two parts 
playing together.
	
	 If you like what you hear, great. If you like your playing but not the 
sound you chose, keep the track and change the sound later through the 
wonders of MIDI. (You can read about how to do so in the next section.) 
If you hate the whole thing, rerecord the second part until you’re happy.
Repeat the preceding steps, selecting a new track each time you want to 
record a new part. Pick your sound, adjust the effects as needed, and record!
Refining Your MIDI Recordings
As already mentioned, MIDI recording captures only the gestures you made, 
not the resulting sounds. MIDI technology gives you the freedom both to 
make tweaks and changes here and there to smooth out imperfections and 
to completely change aspects of what you originally played. The following 
­sections discuss several of the most common adjustments.
Fixing small mistakes
Any keyboard that has a multipart MIDI sequencer is going to have an edit 
mode of some sort, and all recording software for computers has sophisti­
cated edit modes. If you really don’t like what you played, of course, you’re 
better off to just try again with a new recording. But if your part is pretty 
good, with only a few small issues, editing the MIDI data is the way to go.

Adjusting the timing of your playing
If your rhythm was a little sloppy or you started to play ahead of or behind 
the beat, you can use an edit tool called quantize or quantization. This func­
tion lines up all your notes to the nearest subdivision of the beat that you 
select. Basically, any note in the track that doesn’t play exactly on the subdi­
vision you’ve selected gets moved forward or backward so it now appears in 
the right spot. The size of the subdivision (eighth note, sixteenth note, and 
so on) that you should use depends on the type of part you’re playing. Long, 
sustained chords can be quantized to half notes or whole notes, for example.
You can almost always undo edits of this sort to revert the track back to its 
original state, so feel free to experiment with different timing resolutions 
(levels of subdivision). Try to use the finest or highest resolution (greatest 
level of subdivision) that still gives you a good result. You may start with 
thirty-second notes or sixteenth notes to see whether that level fixes the 
problems without changing the feel of the majority of the track. If you choose 
a resolution that messes with a lot of the notes you played, moving them 
around in ways you don’t like, just undo the command and try another set­
ting. The coarser the resolution you use (perhaps eighth notes or quarter 
notes), the more likely it is to adversely affect your recorded performance.
	
If only a few notes of your performance are off, you don’t have to quantize the 
whole track. If your sequencer allows you to view an event edit list, you can 
find the bad note and edit the timing location it starts at to move it to the right 
place. This approach is certainly more detailed editing, but it may be safer than 
changing the feel of your whole track with a quantize command. Figure 3-7 
shows a MIDI event list with a bad note highlighted so you can change the start 
time to fix it. The highlighted note was played a little late; by changing the 6 to 
a 1 you can move it back on time with the rest of the chord that was played.

Some sequencers offer another type of view of your data to use while making 
edits. A piano roll view (shown in Figure 3-8) displays notes as small dots or 
rectangles along a grid where the vertical axis represents the notes of a key­
board and the horizontal axis represents the time in your recording. You can 
scroll from the beginning (far left) to the end (far right), selecting, ­copying, 
deleting, and dragging notes to change their timing (left to right) or their 
pitches (top to bottom). In Figure 3-8, the highlighted note was played a little 
late; by dragging it slightly to the left, you can move it back on time with the 
rest of the chord that was played.
Correcting wrong notes
Everyone makes mistakes at times, including playing bum notes. If you’ve 
played a lot of them, record another pass. However, if your recording has 
only a few bad notes, go in and edit them in either event list or piano roll 
views. Listen to the song, pay attention to the measure and beat where the 
mistake occurs, and isolate and change the note to any other note you want. 
Remember: The note will still be played in the same place, at the same level, 
and for the same duration. The only change will be to the pitch.
A common mistake for all keyboard players is hitting two notes together 
when you meant to play only one. Your finger may slightly graze the side 
of the intended key and grab the adjacent note along with it. These small 
mistakes are easy to find in editing modes. Try piano roll view if possible 
because you can easily see the two notes next to each other.

Here’s a great pointer for finding those accidentally brushed notes: They’ll 
always be much quieter than the main note (a characteristic easily seen in an 
event list) and will often be very short in duration (a characteristic easily 
seen in piano roll view). So when you see two notes occurring right next to 
each other at the exact same timing location, look for those two attributes. 
That will always be the bum note!
Changing the pitch of a note
You can also use the editing features of your sequencer to enhance your MIDI 
performance without losing that perfect take. If you’re writing a song, you can 
always go into edit mode and change a note or two in your melody to try out 
new melodic ideas. Here are other ways to use this capability:
	
✓	Try alternate bass notes. If you always play the root for each chord, you 
can make your part more interesting by changing some of the notes to 
the fifth or creating more of a walking bass line.
	
✓	Add more notes to your chords. Playing large chords can be difficult. 
No problem: Take a given note in the chord, copy, it, and then change its 
pitch. This way, you make a three-note chord a four-note chord, adding 
a seventh or other fancier tone. If you find it hard to reach octaves while 
playing other notes in between, just build them up after the fact.
	
✓	Change your left-hand part. If you played single notes, you can turn 
them into octaves by copying each note and then changing the pitch 
of the copied note to an octave higher or lower. You can also do the 
reverse to make octaves gentler: Delete each octave note, turning it into 
single notes in the left hand.
	
✓	Try out different drum sounds. The various drum sounds in a drum 
program are arranged across the keyboard so that you can easily play a 
normal drum part within a two-octave range (MIDI notes C2 through C4). 
That leaves a lot of other sounds that are assigned to the rest of the key 
range. Many are percussion sounds such as congas, triangle, shakers, 
and the all-important cowbell, but you usually also find alternate bass 
and snare drums as well as different cymbals. For your recorded drum 
part, you can try out these variations by using the note shift/change 
function.
	
	Say your snare drum is E2. Locate another snare drum sound — perhaps 
A1. When you find a possible replacement, in edit mode select all the 
E2 notes (consult your owner’s manual for specific instructions). After 
you’ve selected all the E2s, you can change them to the new note, A1.
	
If you change all the notes, you put the song into another key. This process is 
called transposing, and it’s commonly a separate function or edit choice. 
Common reasons for transposing include helping a singer be in a comfortable 
range for his or her voice — men and women rarely sing in the same keys — 
and letting guitar players use more open strings (which sounds good when 
strumming chords and playing strong, distorted parts) Piano players like to 

540
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
play in C major, for example, because it uses all the white notes. But ­guitars 
sound really good in E major because so many of the open strings work well 
for that key. No problem; transpose to the rescue!
Editing notes played too softly or too loudly
Sometimes as you play, a note’s volume comes out a little too loud or soft 
relative to the other notes around it. You can easily fix this discrepancy by 
editing the velocity of the note. Make these changes in event edit view if at 
all possible because you can clearly see and highlight the MIDI velocity value 
that you want to change. Remember that you can always undo an edit and try 
again until you find the value that best matches the music.
Some sequencers let you scale the velocity of a given track or range of notes. 
You encounter two interpretations of this concept:
	
✓	Scale to create crescendos or decrescendos: This option takes the 
range of notes that you select and alters their velocity to crescendo, 
where each subsequent note is slightly louder than the one before it, or 
decrescendo, where each subsequent note is slightly softer than the one 
before it. You can usually set the start velocity and the end velocity to 
achieve the most natural gradation in dynamics (changes in volume).
	
✓	Scale all the velocities relative to their current values: This approach 
keeps all the relative dynamic values between notes the same but can 
increase or decrease them all by a chosen amount. Whether you think 
of it as adding or subtracting some value from each level or multiplying 
each level by some value, the result should be clear: Your whole part 
gets softer or louder but still sounds the same dynamically.
	
	You may be thinking, “Why not just use the mixer to change the level of 
the track?” Good question! You can use touch to change a lot of aspects 
of a sound, such as switching multisample layers or the velocity routed 
to the filter. When you scale the velocity of the MIDI data, you interact 
with these settings in ways that changing the volume of the track doesn’t. 
You might use this type of command on parts where the switching of 
velocity layers in a performance isn’t feeling just right or where you 
simply didn’t play a part as softly or loudly as you wanted.
Mixing your MIDI song
After you’ve recorded all the parts you want and are happy with the perfor­
mances, it’s time to mix your song. Mixing is the act of adjusting the blend of 
sounds and parts in a song to make them all sound good (volume, panning, 
and effects), blend together without clashing (EQ), and ensure each part can 
be heard without overpowering each other (volume). If you hear nothing but 
drums (or everything but drums) or your piano left hand, the guitar chords 
and bass guitar are creating a muddy mess, and that’s no good.

541
 Chapter 3: Recording and Editing Your Sounds
Book VI
Exploring 
Electronic 
Keyboard 
Technology
Your sequencer or recorder menu has a page that may be labeled something 
like Mixer or may just be the main track view page. It has controls for the 
level of each track, a pan knob, and perhaps some control over effects.
	
EQ (equalization) may be available as its own set of parameters or may be 
part of the effects. It’s an important tool in the mixing process, so be sure to 
find out where it’s available in your keyboard.
To first experiment with mixing, try the following approach:
	
1.	Pick a single track and note its current volume level.
	
	 Good choices to start with are the drums or the bass if your song has 
these parts. (If it doesn’t, try a supporting part behind your keyboard 
sound such as strings or a synth pad part.)
	
2.	Bring its level all the way down to 0 and notice how that change 
affects your perception of the whole song.
	
3.	Bring the level up slowly and listen to the results.
	
	 Don’t look at the value; use your ears.
	
4.	When it sounds good to you, look at what value you ended up at.
	
	 There are no wrong choices; it’s just personal taste.
	
5.	Repeat Steps 1 through 4 with other parts, always taking note of the 
starting level.
You can certainly bring all the volume sliders down to 0 and then try to build 
up the mix from scratch, but try to only do so only after you’ve gotten used 
to the sound of a good mix.
There’s no one rule or magic formula for making a song sound good. Here are 
a few suggestions to help you achieve a good balance in your mix:
	
✓	Don’t allow the melody to get buried or lost within the other instru­
ments. No matter what type of music or instruments you use, the 
melody of your song is the most important thing.
	
✓	If you’re having trouble getting your melody loud enough, try lowering 
the levels of the other parts instead.
	
✓	Consider starting by getting the drums’ and bass’s balance right 
(if your music has those sounds). Bring the drums up first and then add 
the bass, raising its level until it sounds strong and tightly connected to 
the drums — especially the bass drum. Then start adding other tracks 
without overpowering those first two sounds.

542
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
	
✓	The main parts of your music (melody, drums, and bass) should be 
panned center. Other parts can be panned slightly to the left or right 
to add aural interest to your music. Having everything come from the 
center or equally from both speakers sounds a little plain.
	
✓	Don’t overdo the reverb levels. If you increase the reverb send for every 
part, your song will sound sloppy and become a wash of echoes. A safe 
starting point is to put only medium reverb at most on your drums, use 
no reverb for your bass, and add reverb to other parts carefully.
	
	Here’s a good basic concept: Adding reverb to a part makes it sound far­
ther away. You want your important melodic parts to be close, so don’t 
overdo their reverb. To move back in the mix, you can lower its volume, 
but you can also add reverb to move it farther away.
	
✓	If you find that parts are getting too thick or muddy sounding, use EQ 
to help make each track work in the combined mix. Try cutting the 
levels of some frequencies to help parts sound distinct. Your bass drum 
and bass are the most important low frequency sounds, so try cutting 
the lows from other parts to let the bass part stand out clearly. (Do this 
cut on the other parts first, before just boosting the lows on the bass/
bass drum.)
	
	Too many high frequencies may fight with your melody, so try cutting 
them on some other parts if they’re getting in the way. If you want a part 
to stand out a little bit more, boosting some higher EQ can really help. 
Pick your parts carefully — you can’t just boost the EQ on everything.
	
✓	You can make some parts more colorful and interesting by adding 
some specialized effects treatment to them. If you have any available 
insert effects left unused, experiment with them. You can also consider 
using the insert effects to put a different type of reverb on a part or two.
If you’re interested in discovering more about this topic, search out Jeff 
Strong’s Home Recording For Musicians For Dummies (Wiley, 2011). It’s a great 
book on the complete art of recording and mixing, and you can apply many of 
the concepts there to using a keyboard recorder or sequencer.
Trying Some Common Sound Edits
Sometimes you play a sound and you like most of what you hear and how it 
responds to your playing, but you wish you could change some small char­
acteristic. Maybe the sound is a little too dark or too bright, or it rings on 
too long after you release the key. In most keyboards, you can fix that with­
out becoming an expert in synth terms and tools or creating a sound from 
scratch. Just follow the suggestions in the following sections, and you can 
start to personalize your sounds and achieve the results you want.

Varying the basic timbre (waveform)
The fastest way to create a new sound is to simply change the waveform of 
an existing sound.
	
1.	Go into the sound or program edit mode of your keyboard.
	
2.	Find the oscillator parameter or page.
	
3.	Select a new waveform or multisample.
	
4.	Save the new sound.
	
	 Don’t forget to give it a new name and save location; otherwise, you’ll 
lose your first sound!
The sections that follow have some common applications for making this 
type of edit.
Trying a slight variation of the current sound type
Many sample-playback keyboards offer more than one multisample or wave­
form of a given type of sound. But the sound they offer for each one has been 
greatly changed to present you with the most sonic variation. So you may 
have two electric piano sounds, but the second one has completely different 
effects, is more distorted (for a heavier rock sound), and is less dynamic to 
your touch. That’s a lot of things to try to edit to make the sound you want, 
right? No worries; just edit the first sound (which you liked) to use the second 
electric piano multisample, and then save it to a new location.
Here are a few other ideas:
	
✓	Take an electric bass sound and replace the waveform with a synth 
waveform. Voilà! Instant synth bass.
	
✓	You can make more synth lead sounds from the onboard waveform 
selection. Find a lead synth sound you like, go into edit mode, and try 
out many of the different synth waveforms. Very few keyboards deliver 
so many closely related lead sounds, but often all you need is a different 
waveform to add more lead sounds to your arsenal.
	
✓	When you have a sound that’s a layer (two sounds on top of each 
other — say, acoustic piano with strings), you can make some cool vari­
ations by changing the waveform for the layered part (the strings). Many 
times, going to a mellow synth or vocal multisample yields another great 
sound without much effort.
	
Track 159 demonstrates some slight variation edit concepts.

544
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Using similar amp characteristics to make a different sound
If a sound plays right (meaning it attacks, sustains, and decays a certain way), 
you can change it to another type of sound by swapping the multisample. 
Figure 3-9 shows some common envelope generator (EG) amp shapes.
Try some of these possibilities:
	
✓	Change a bass guitar sound to a synth wave and then raise the pitch an 
octave or two. Now you have a new lead synth sound.
	
✓	Take a sound that attacks quickly but also decays quickly, like a marimba, 
xylophone, or plucked string. Change the waveform, and you have all 
sorts of new short sounds that work well for percussive parts or for 
arpeggiated patterns.
	
✓	Change the waveform of an organ sound to make a good fast synth sound 
for playing choppy chord parts.
	
✓	Swap out multisamples to make nice synth pad sounds from sustaining 
string and vocal sounds.
	
Track 160 offers examples of making new sounds using EG shape concepts.

Changing the brightness (filter)
This common sound tweak is sometimes just a small adjustment to darken or 
brighten a sound; that can be all you need to go from “not quite” to “perfect.” 
For example, this edit is the first thing many players like to do to acoustic 
piano sounds. What sounds good playing alone at home (warm and darker) 
doesn’t end up cutting through the sound of a full band when you play in a 
club, at church, or wherever. So brighten up the sound a little! The easiest 
way to change the brightness one way or the other is to simply alter the level 
of the filter cutoff. If you don’t see a front-panel control labeled Filter or Filter 
Cutoff, do the following:
	
1.	Go into the sound or program edit mode of your keyboard.
	
2.	Find the filter parameters or page and locate the filter cutoff 
parameter.
	
3.	Raise or lower the value to change the sound.
	
	 To darken the sound, lower the value; to brighten it, raise the value.
	
4.	Save your new sound.
	
	 Be sure to give it a new name and save it to a different location so that 
you don’t lose your first sound!
	
Many keyboards have a front panel knob dedicated to controlling the filter 
cutoff as you play, which means you don’t have to go into edit mode to sweep 
the cutoff (a popular thing to do, especially for synth sounds). Some synths 
have a ribbon controller with the filter cutoff assigned to it. And many small 
performance synths that don’t have this dedicated knob assign filter cutoff to 
the mod wheel for easy filter sweeps.
You may not be able to darken the sound by this simple edit if the sound 
is using an envelope generator to vary the filter cutoff over time. An easy 
clue you’re in this scenario: The filter cutoff is very low, yet you still find the 
sound is bright. In this case, you need to lessen the effect the envelope has 
on the attack section of the shape in order to darken the filter. Look for the 
envelope depth parameter (it may be called Filter EG) or for an envelope 
being used as a modulator assigned to filter cutoff and lower the modulation 
amount.
If your keyboard doesn’t have a Filter EG parameter but has the more 
advanced rate and level envelope generator, lower the attack level value. 
Doing so causes the envelope to not go as high before moving to the decay 
stage, which darkens your sound.

546
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Finally, some sounds use velocity to modulate the filter cutoff or how much 
the filter EG affects the cutoff. When you play this type of sound, a very soft 
touch produces a dark sound, and harder hits produce a brighter sound. 
If you reduce the velocity control over the filter EG or velocity modulation 
amount routed to the filter cutoff, you can darken the sound. Yes, it will still 
get brighter the harder you play, but not as bright. (Note that the softer 
touch will now be even darker, but often that difference isn’t an issue. If it 
does bother you, raise the filter cutoff just a few numbers.)
	
Don’t forget that EQ is also a type of filter control; you can lower the high EQ 
level to darken your sound some and raise it to brighten it.
Adjusting the amp parameters 
 (volume over time)
Changing the attack and release of a sound is another common, very effective 
tweak to make. Many good sounds that have some release after you let go of 
the key can sound sloppy when you’re playing faster phrases.
To fix this issue, just follow these steps:
	
1.	Go into the sound or program edit mode of your keyboard.
	
2.	Find the amp parameters or page, locate the amp envelope generator, 
and lower the release or release rate/time parameter.
	
	 This step lessens or tightens up the ringing after you let go of a key.
	
	 Note: Most synthesizers have dedicated front panel knobs for the ampli­
fier envelope (likely labeled ADSR), so you can make this change without 
looking through menus or pages.
	
3.	Save your new sound.
	
	 Give it a new name and save location so you avoid losing your first 
sound.
Likewise, a too-slow attack makes a sound hard to play quickly. To adjust the 
attack, repeat Steps 2 and 3 in the preceding list, substituting the attack rate 
parameter for the release parameter in Step 2. To speed up the attack, lower 
the value.
A quick tip is to take a quick on/quick off sound such as an organ and slightly 
slow up the attack and lengthen the release. This process turns the sound 
into a different type of pad sound, great for dreamier background chords in a 
slow song.

547
 Chapter 3: Recording and Editing Your Sounds
Book VI
Exploring 
Electronic 
Keyboard 
Technology
	
Some more advanced envelope designs offer a start level and then a second 
stage for the attack level and rate. To get a quicker attack, check to see 
whether the start level is very low or very high. If it’s quite low, try raising that 
level to the same level as the attack in the second stage. To slow down an 
attack, a high start level may get in your way. If so, lower the start level back 
to 00 before working on the attack time.
Personalizing the touch 
response of a sound
A common issue among owners of keyboards is liking a sound though it still 
doesn’t “feel” right to them. It gets loud too easily or is too hard to control when 
playing quietly. Playing harder and softer does switch between waveforms, but 
getting the hardest velocity layer to sound consistently is difficult. The following 
sections present a few easy edits to make to correct this problem. These types 
of edits are easy to do and can often be the most satisfying fix to make.
Customizing a sound’s dynamics
	
Dynamics refer to how loudly or softly you play a note and are usually con­
trolled by your touch on the key. All keyboards offer a touch curve or touch 
setting that affects dynamics. This parameter translates your playing force 
into instructions for how a sound will respond. If a sound isn’t feeling quite 
right, go to the touch curve or velocity curve parameter first. You most often 
find it in the global or settings mode of a keyboard.
You can also manipulate how your touch affects the dynamics by routing 
velocity to the amp output. Increasing this amount of modulation makes your 
soft touch produce an even quieter sound, so you’ll need more force to get 
the sound louder. Often velocity will be routed to modulate the amp envelope 
amount so you need to locate that parameter and increase its value as well.
Tweaking the filter envelope
When changing attack/release significantly on 
a sound, you may expose the filter envelope 
movement because it’s now different from your 
amp envelope shape. Say you speed up the 
attack of the amp and now hear the filter slowly 
opening up at the start of each new note, or 
you lengthen the release of the amp and now 
hear the filter closing too quickly while your 
sound is fading away. The filter envelope used 
to match or follow the amp envelope shape 
closely, but now it stands out. In these cases, 
you want to go to the filter envelope and make 
similar edits to its attack and release times 
as those explained in the preceding section 
“Adjusting the amp parameters (volume over 
time).” Some synths even offer the ability to 
tweak the filter and amp envelopes at the same 
time, presented as a single/grouped parameter 
in a quick edit or performance edit page.

548
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
If your sound gets too quiet and then too easily gets way loud, you need 
to reduce the amount of velocity modulation of the amp or amp envelope 
output. Your sound will get louder overall, so you’ll need to lower the amp 
output to compensate. Be sure to check whether any velocity is routed to 
filter modulation; if so, you want to lessen that as well.
	
Not all keyboards allow you to do this level of editing. Certainly, synths and 
workstations, advanced arrangers, and perhaps a more advanced stage piano 
do, but otherwise, you may be limited to the touch curve method.
Another cool way to make a sound seem more dynamic is to add or increase the 
amount of velocity controlling the filter cutoff. When you do so, your soft touch 
causes the filter to be darker, which makes a sound seem quieter. If you’re first 
adding this amount, you need to lower the filter cutoff to give the velocity some 
room to move. Try starting with the filter cutoff all the way down to 00 and then 
adjusting the velocity modulation amount and the cutoff until it feels right.
	
This change should be subtle; you’re looking to get a sense of volume change, 
not a drastic filter sweep. If a sound is already using velocity to modulate the 
amount of filter envelope control, increase this modulation amount and work 
with it and the filter cutoff value until it feels right. If you find that your sound 
gets too bright with more forceful playing, you’re ­modulating it too much.
Matching velocity switch points to your touch
Sample-playback keyboards often use different multisamples of a keyboard, 
recorded at softer and harder touches, to make a sound more realistic and 
expressive. All the better sampled acoustic and electric piano sounds do, for 
sure. Although this method is a great approach to re-creating these sounds, the 
programmed velocity values for when to switch to the next multisample may not 
match your touch. Basically, what you perceive as a touch to dynamics or bright­
ness problem may actually be a problem with when the keyboard switches to a 
different multisample. If you have a synth, workstation, or more advanced stage 
piano or arranger, you may be able to access the multisample switching to see 
whether it’s the issue before you go to the amp and filter parameters. Here’s how:
	
1.	Go into sound/program edit mode.
	
2.	Find the oscillator page(s) and look to see whether multiple wave­
forms or multisamples are arranged to be switched by velocity values.
	
	 On some instruments, this info is all presented on one oscillator page, 
but on others it’s another part, tone, or layer that is a complete sound 
element set to be triggered by a certain velocity range.
	
3.	Check the velocity values.
	
	 Look at the velocity values used for each multisample or part. MIDI 
velocity ranges from 001 to 127, so you’ll encounter several subranges 
for an oscillator or multisample — maybe 001 to 32, 033 to 070, 071 to 
100, and 101 to 127. Notice that the numbers all run consecutively, with 
no range overlapping.

4.	Adjust the value of the appropriate layer(s).
	
	 If the top layer is coming in too easily for you or producing too bright 
a sound, you want to move its start value to a higher velocity number, 
making it take even more force to trigger it. Set the range to 112 to 127 
and see whether that feels better. Remember, though, that you can’t 
leave a hole between two layers. With your change, nothing is sounding 
from 100 to 111, so you have to go back to layer three and raise the top 
threshold so that the range covers 071 to 111. Now the full range of values 
will produce sound.
	
	 To make a sound more dynamic and softer at low velocity levels, increase 
the range of values that the lower layers occupy, only bringing in the 
upper layers at the highest values. To make a sound brighter and more 
aggressive, increase the range that the upper layers use, spreading them 
across the majority of the range and only using the lower layers for the 
lowest numbers.
	
If you want to get to hear the character of each multisample, you can go to an 
initialized sound location in your keyboard (if it has one) and assign this multi-
sample to that “raw” sound. It won’t sound perfect, but you can hear the 
true character of the recording and can better judge what each waveform 
sounds like.
Getting Your Song out of the 
Keyboard and into the World
After your MIDI-based song is mixed, you need to capture the sound of it 
to allow others to hear it away from your keyboard. Translation: You need 
to make an audio recording of the song. If your keyboard can record both 
MIDI and audio, it will have some sort of command, often called Bouncing or 
Bouncing Down to record the whole song to audio. Follow the instructions 
from your owner’s manual.
If your keyboard can only do MIDI recording, you need an external audio 
recorder or computer software and audio interface for your computer to 
make the recording. You connect the main audio outputs of your keyboard to 
the audio inputs of the recorder or audio interface, and then you can capture/
record the song.
When you use audio recording, however, you’re already saving your work to 
some form of media as you record. And most products record in the industry 
standard wave file format, so sharing it with others is simple.

550
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
With the file you want visible, move or copy it to your hard drive. Make a 
folder on your computer for saving your personal recording files to. After the 
file is on your computer, you can play it, import it into your music library, 
and share it with your friends. Here are some common ways to share:
	
✓	E-mail it. Because you’re using wave files, the file size may be too large. 
(Some e-mail systems can’t accept files larger than 8 to 10MB, for example.) 
First, compress the file (the most common form is .zip) and see how much 
smaller it gets. Compressing is a good first step because it doesn’t degrade 
the quality of your music file; it just packs it smaller to send it. If it becomes 
small enough to send, great. When your recipient unzips the file, it will be 
back to its full size and pristine audio quality.
	
✓	Use a file transfer service. If the file is still very large after compressing, 
you can consider using one of the many online options for sending bigger 
files, such as Dropbox. You upload your file to a service’s website; the ser­
vice stores it and sends your recipient a link so he can download the file 
privately through his web browser, avoiding the e-mail size limits. Many 
services offer free transfers up to 2 GB and paid options for larger files.
	
✓	Upload it to a music-sharing site. Many sites allow you to share, stream, 
and offer your music for free or paid download. These sites often perform 
the file compression for you; you upload your wave file, and they take 
care of the rest. Popular sites include Soundcloud (www.soundcloud.
com), Reverb Nation (www.reverbnation.com), and YouTube (www.
youtube.com — yes, you can share just audio files there). When the 
music is uploaded, you can post a link to your social media accounts to 
share it with anyone with an Internet connection. Remember, these sites 
may be visible to the population at large, so consider just how public you 
want to make your performance.
Converting to MP3 and other compressed formats
If your compressed file is still too big to send, 
another choice is to convert your wave file to 
another audio format that makes it smaller. 
MP3 is the most widely used format and is fine 
for casual use, but note that it degrades the 
sound quality of your music to some degree. 
Your computer music player application (such 
as Apple iTunes or Windows Media Player) 
can probably perform this conversion. If you 
go this route, check the settings to be sure 
you’re using the highest-quality conversion. 
Often such programs convert to 128 Kbps (kilo­
bits per second) format, which is too low and 
compromises audio quality. Use the highest 
setting: 320 Kbps.
Other formats for compressing music sound 
better, such as Apple’s Apple Lossless Audio 
Codec or ALAC format, MP4 (shown as either 
.mp4 or .m4a), Ogg Vorbis (.ogg), and FLAC. 
Keep in mind that not all your recipients may 
know about or have the right playback applica­
tions for these file types, so check in advance 
before sending them. Depending on the size, 
you may now be able to e-mail it or stay within 
a file-sharing service’s free limits.

P

laying an instrument is a wonderful activity, and being able to express 
yourself through music is both satisfying and actually good for your 
­long-term health and well being. Learning to read music and develop your tech­
nique involves hard work; there are no magic shortcuts to developing your 
skills, no matter what those Internet ads and online courses may promise.
However, many portable keyboards today offer some great features to help 
you get started, guide you through proper practice routines, and make the 
study of music into a fun game for kids of all ages.
This chapter takes you through the educational features and helpers built 
into many of the Casio and Yamaha keyboards. People often find the included 
manuals a bit cryptic — the intent here is to explain both how and why you 
want to do things. Even if you don’t own one of these keyboards, you’ll find 
this chapter interesting and helpful when shopping for a new keyboard.
Working with Built-In Songs
Most electronic keyboards have some built-in demo songs, which the store 
uses to show off the instrument’s sounds and sonic capabilities. But this 
class of portable keyboards, along with many digital pianos, usually also has 
a library of simple folk songs, holiday favorites, popular classical selections, 
and instructional songs to help you in your studies. Look on the front panel 
for a button labeled Song (Yamaha) or Song Bank (Casio) to confirm that your 
keyboard has actual songs built in, not just a few in-store demos.

552
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Some of these tunes are simple two-handed piano playing, others use the 
onboard auto-accompaniment, and some are orchestrated to sound like a full 
production. No matter what the style, you can listen and learn from them.
Selecting a song
First, you need to choose a song. On most low-end models the song names, 
or at least the categories, appear on the front panel, as shown in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1: 
Front panel 
song list.

1.	To select a built-in song, press the Song or Song Bank mode button.
	
	 You’ll also see the word Demos on the front panel; usually, it means you 
have to hold down two buttons to bring up a special playback mode of 
all the built-in songs. That’s not what you’re looking for in this step; that 
function plays through all the songs like a jukebox gone mad. You need 
to be able to select one specific song of your choosing for this process.
	
2.	Use any of the data entry controls (+/−, up/down, numeric keypad, 
value wheel/slider, or whatever applies) to select the song you want to 
listen to.
	
3.	Press Play or Start/Stop to listen to the song.
	
4.	While the song is playing, press the Pause button (see Figure 4-2) to 
stop the song but keep it at the current location.
	
	 To resume play from where you left off, press Pause again. If you press 
Stop, you stop the song and relocate to the beginning.

5.	Press the Fast Forward (FF) button to move ahead through the song 
while it’s playing and the Rewind (REW) button to scroll back to an 
earlier section of the song.
	
	 On many keyboards, if you press FF or REW once, the song moves one 
measure in the chosen direction. Holding down the button causes the key­
board to speed through the song until you let go. Then it resumes playing.
Note: A couple of other buttons — Repeat & Learn and A-B Repeat — also 
appear in Figure 4-2. These buttons come into play in the later section 
“Repeating small sections.”
Slowing down the tempo
You’ve found a song you like, and now you want to attempt to play it for your­
self. Your keyboard may come with printed music for the included songs as 
part of the manual, or you may want to figure it out by ear. Whatever method 
you choose, the first step should be slowing down the song so you can hear 
it at a slower tempo, good for learning and playing along with. Learning a 
song at a comfortable (meaning slow) tempo before attempting to play it at 
the final, correct tempo is important. Work slowly and gradually increase the 
speed as you get comfortable.
Your keyboard has two buttons labeled Tempo — an Up control and a Down 
control (as shown in Figure 4-3) — or a Tempo knob or slider. You can use 
these to adjust the tempo as desired.

Use the Tap Tempo feature if it’s available; refer to Figure 4-3. This function lets 
you tap on a marked button at the speed/timing you want to set the tempo to. 
When setting the tempo with Tap Tempo, you need to tap at least three times 
to give the keyboard a clear indication of the tempo you want.

554
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Turning off one of the parts (RH or LH)
Many keyboards that offer piano pieces as part of their learning systems 
have a feature for turning off one of the hands or parts. This functionality 
is a good way to be able to listen to and focus on one part at a time without 
being distracted by the other part. After you’ve learned one of the parts, you 
can turn it off, turn on the other part, and play a duet with the system, each 
­playing one hand.
Look on the front panel of your keyboard for a button labeled Part Select or 
buttons labeled Part 1 and Part 2 or RH/R (right hand) and LH/L (left hand). 
Figure 4-4 shows some examples. These buttons turn off a selected part, tog­
gling it on and off with each press. Look at your display for visual feedback of 
what you’re doing with each button press.
	
You may need to be in Lesson mode to turn off parts on some models. Lesson 
modes are discussed later in the chapter.
Repeating small sections
As you start to learn a song, you want to limit the playback to small sections 
at a time. Dividing a piece into small phrases is an essential part of practicing 
that allows you to concentrate on each section and work on it over and over 
again. Plus, working on small phrases helps when you’re trying to figure out a 
song by ear.

 Chapter 4: Using Onboard Learning Systems
Book VI
Exploring 
Electronic 
Keyboard 
Technology
The easiest way to create these smaller phrases is to press a button to mark 
the start and end locations you want while the song is playing. On Casio 
­keyboards, this button is labeled Repeat; on Yamaha, it’s often A-B Repeat 
(refer to Figure 4-2). On both brands, setting up these repeats is easy to do:
	
1.	Select and start the song playing.
	
2.	As you come to the measure you want to start repeating from, simply 
press the Repeat or A-B Repeat button to set the start marker.
	
3.	When you reach the end of the phrase you want to use, press the same 
button again to set the end marker.
	
	 If you’re having trouble setting the right measures, try slowing down the 
tempo while you set the markers. Then you can raise it back to the 
speed you want. If you miss the bar you wanted, you can just press the 
REW button to move back one measure with each tap.
	
	 Now when you play the song, it will start with a count-in to get you 
ready and then play the same selected range of measures over and over. 
While it’s playing, you can still use the FF, REW, and Pause buttons and 
adjust the tempo.
	
4.	To turn off these repeat markers, simply press the Repeat or A-B Repeat 
button again.
	
	Doing so clears those markers so that your song plays fully from beginning 
to end.
Introducing Casio’s Step-up 
Lesson System
You’re not on your own to learn the onboard songs; a patient electronic teacher 
is waiting to help! Each system is a little different; the following sections get you 
up to speed on the Casio version.
Following the steps: Listen, 
watch, and remember
The Casio teacher takes you through three levels of learning and practice:
	
✓	Listen: Sit back, let the song play, and get familiar with it. The song plays 
in small phrase sections, and the display shows you what notes to play 
and what fingers to use.

556
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
	
✓	Watch: Now the system guides you, requiring you to play the notes your­
self. The display shows you the notes and fingering. On certain models, 
the keys even light up to show you the way. Some models talk to you, 
with the teacher telling you what finger to use. Follow the guides and 
play through the phrase; timing/tempo isn’t important at this stage, only 
the right notes. If you make a mistake, the system will wait for you and 
guide you with the right answer.
	
✓	Remember: Now the helpers are turned off, and hopefully you’ve 
learned what to do. But not to worry; the helpers come back when you 
get stuck! Play the song in time, still in the smaller phrase context.
You can play each phrase section as many times as you want and at any 
tempo, so you can master them all no matter how easy or difficult you find 
each one. You can stay on each of the teaching modes for as long as you like.
	
When first learning a song you should work each phrase through the system 
(Listen, Watch, and Remember) instead of trying to absorb too many phrases 
in a row.
Getting started: Picking what to work on
Your first step is to choose a song you want to work with. Consider a song 
you’ve heard before if this is the first time you’re trying this feature. Here’s 
how it works:
	
1.	To select a built-in song, press the Song Bank mode button.
	
2.	Use any of the data entry controls (+/−, up/down, numeric keypad, or 
whatever) to select the song you want to learn.
	
3.	Choose where to start.
	
	 If you’re just starting out with a new song, you want to begin at the 
beginning. But if you want to work on a different phrase, press the Next 
button to advance through them. Watch the screen to find the phrase 
number you want.
	
	 You can also use the FF and REW buttons to move back and forth 
through the phrases.
You can (and should!) work on new songs one hand at a time. To select which 
hand to work on, press the button labeled Part Select. (The label appears 
under the button; above the button is the label for Chord/Accomp On/Off.)
Each press of the button toggles from one hand to the other to both hands 
on to both off. As Figure 4-5 shows, the selected hand/part has a faint shadow 
around it.

Lesson 1: Listening and letting 
the teacher show you how
The first step in learning a new song is to listen and let the teacher demonstrate 
what to do. You’ve already selected your song and the hand/part to work on, so 
all you need to do is press the Listen button. (Figure 4-6 illustrates all the Casio 
lesson controls.)
Figure 4-6:

controls.

558
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
After a short count-in, the song starts playing. If the song has an introduction 
before your melody comes in, the display will show “Wait” and then “Next” as 
it moves into the first phrase you need to learn. When the phrase starts, the 
display shows you two things (as shown in Figure 4-7):
	
✓	The keyboard graphic indicates the proper note.
	
✓	The hand graphic indicates the correct finger.
The phrase will keep repeating over and over. Listen to get familiar with the 
music, first for the rhythm of the notes — when do they play, and for how long? 
Then pay attention to the screen to see the notes and fingerings. Try to memo­
rize both the notes and the fingerings; you might play “air keys” just above the 
notes to start to get a feel for what will happen when you play for real.
	
Note you’ll hear the parts for both hands, not just the one you selected. Your 
part selection determines only what the keyboard displays, so be sure to 
listen closely to the hand you’ve chosen to work on.
When you feel comfortable with this step, press Listen again to stop the phrase 
play. You’re ready to move on to Lesson 2 (described in the following section).

Lesson 2: Playing and watching 
the display for guidance
When you have the phrase in your ears and the notes and fingerings somewhat 
memorized, you can move on to trying to play the phrase:
	
1.	Press the Watch button (refer to Figure 4-6); you get a count-in, and 
then the phrase starts to play.
	
2.	Follow the instructions and play along.
	
	 The display shows you each note to play as it comes up, blinking the 
note until it’s time to play it, at which point it turns solid. The display 
indicates which finger to use by highlighting it on the hand graphic. 
If you pause, the teacher’s voice will tell you which finger to use.
	
	 Listen to Track 161 to hear an example of the onboard teacher.
	
	 The phrase will keep repeating over and over; at first, you should con­
centrate on playing the right note with the right finger. You don’t have 
to worry about your timing for now, although it’s good to try to be in 
rhythm. If you make a mistake don’t worry, the music will sit and wait for 
you until you play the right note. If you play the right note quickly, the 
music will advance to match what you do. As you get comfortable, work 
on playing the notes with the right rhythm/timing.
	
3.	When you’re finished, press Watch again to stop the phrase play.
	
	 You can also use the Stop button to turn off the phrase play.
Lesson 3: Progressing from 
watch to remember
The third mode, Remember, is the way of testing whether you’ve really learned 
Lessons 1 and 2. The music plays with no guidance from the teacher, and you 
must play the right notes in the right timing to succeed.
	
1.	Press Remember (refer to Figure 4-6); the system gives you a count-in 
to get ready.
	
2.	Start to play, being sure to play with good timing.

560
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
	
	 If you get stuck or play a wrong note, the helpers will come back to point 
you back on track. The note will sound and show on the display, and 
the teacher will tell you the correct finger. After you’ve played the right 
note, you’re back on your own until you have a problem.
	
	 When you’ve played through the whole phrase, the system will give you 
a reaction like “Do it again” or “Bravo!” Either way, the lesson will repeat 
over and over until you press Remember or Stop.
When you’ve mastered the chosen phrase, you can go back, pick another 
phrase (as outlined in the earlier section “Getting started: Picking what to 
work on”), and start the process again!
	
As you get comfortable with a song, you can use the Auto-Lesson mode 
(refer to Figure 4-6), which steps you through each phrase for the currently 
selected hand. Each lesson type is demonstrated once (watch) and then 
the remember phase is repeated three times. Then you have to play from the 
beginning, so the farther you get into the phrases, the more of the song you 
have to play. This mode is best when you’ve already worked through the 
phrases individually; it makes for a great practice routine after learning 
a song.
Turning off some of the helpers
You don’t have to use all the helpers all the time; you can turn each one off if 
desired. Here are a few suggestions:
	
✓	Press the Auto button (refer to Figure 4-6) to turn off the phrase 
repeats. Now each section only plays once and then goes to the next. 
This option is best for when you’ve gotten comfortable with each phrase.
	
✓	You can turn off the voice that guides you for the fingerings. Here’s 
how the process works for some models:
	
1.	Keep pressing the Function button until you get to Speak = On.
	
2.	Press – on the numeric keypad to turn it off. Press + to turn it 
back on.
	
	For other models
	
1.	Press the Function button.
	
2.	Scroll using the right arrow button (6 on the numeric keypad) or 
left arrow button (4 on the numeric keypad) until you get to Lesson.

561
 Chapter 4: Using Onboard Learning Systems
Book VI

Electronic 
Keyboard 
Technology
	
3.	Press Enter (the 9 button).
	
4.	Scroll until the display shows Speak; press – on the numeric 
keypad to turn it off and + to turn it back on.
	
✓	You can turn off the note guide that sounds the note when you get 
stuck. Some models use the following process:
	
1.	Keep pressing the Function button until you get to NoteGuid=On.
	
2.	Press – on the numeric keypad to turn it off; press + to turn it 
back on.
	
	For other models
	
1.	Press the Function button.
	
2.	Scroll using the right arrow button or left arrow button until you 
get to Lesson.
	
3.	Press Enter.
	
4.	Scroll until the display shows NoteGuid; press – on the numeric 
keypad to turn it off and + to turn it back on.
	
✓	You can go through any lesson level without the song being divided 
into smaller phrases. This exercise is good when you think you’ve 
­mastered the whole song but still want some guidance. For some 
models, you
	
1.	Keep pressing the Function button until you get to Phrase 
Ln=PrE (preset).
	
2.	Press – on the numeric keypad to turn it off and + to turn it back on.
	
	For other models
	
1.	Press the Function button.
	
2.	Scroll using the right arrow button or left arrow button until you 
get to Phrase Ln.
	
3.	Press Enter.
	
4.	Scroll until the display shows Phrase Ln; press – on the numeric 
keypad to turn it off and + to turn it back on.

562
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Playing the whole song yourself
When you’ve mastered all the lessons, you can play the song from beginning 
to end with no helpers and no pauses. This approach works best for songs 
that have some additional backing; it’s not helpful for a solo piano piece. 
Do the following:
	
1.	Press the Part Select button (see Figure 4-4, Ex.2) until both hands are 
shadowed in the display.
	
	 This move stops the keyboard from playing the parts; it’s all up to you!
	
2.	Press Start to begin the song playing.
	
	 It will play from beginning to end with no reaction to what you play. The 
display still shows you the notes and fingerings if you want to use the 
guide, but it doesn’t wait for you or say anything.
	
You can have some fun with this level of playback because you can add some 
extra notes or even improvise over the backing. Have a good time and be 
creative!
Exploring Yamaha’s Educational 
Suite Lesson System
Yamaha calls its lesson system the Yamaha Educational Suite (Y.E.S. for short). 
It has various implementations, meaning some keyboards offer more and 
deeper educational features than others. This section goes over the basic 
aspects that are common to all of them in the following sections.
	
To select which hand to work on, press one of the buttons labeled L or R 
(refer to Figure 4-4, Ex.2 earlier in the chapter) near the Lesson section of 
the front panel. Pressing both buttons lets you choose two-hand playing.
	
If you need to, use the REW button to move back a few measures to try a part 
again. Even better, Yamaha has a dedicated Repeat & Learn button (see Figure 4-8) 
that moves you back four measures and then keeps repeating that phrase over 
and over until you press the button again. If you want to keep practicing a spe­
cific phrase within the song, you can use the A-B Repeat button to set the start 
and end of the phrase. Then the phrase will play, stop, count-in and then play 
again, over and over. You can change the number of bars it jumps back by 
pressing a number on the keypad (1 through 9) just after pressing the Repeat & 
Learn button. This function works in any of the lesson modes. In any lesson 
mode, you can also always stop the song by pressing Start/Stop.

Following the steps: Listening, waiting, 
your tempo, and minus one
The Yamaha teacher takes you through three levels of learning and practice ­— 
Waiting, Your Tempo, and Minus One — but these instructions add a 
fourth (Listening):
	
✓	Listening: You start the song and listen as it plays to get familiar with it. 
The keyboard displays the note(s) being played, both on a music staff 
(notation) and with an indicator over the graphic of the keys. You’re on 
your own for fingering.
	
	Most of the Y.E.S.-based keyboards don’t show this mode (Listening) 
from the front panel, but you can easily get them to play their songs with 
the visual guidance. Just select a song and press Start/Stop.
	
✓	Waiting: The keyboard displays the note you need to play the same as 
it does for the Listening step. It waits until you play the correct note to 
move on to the next. As with the Listening phase, it doesn’t show you 
fingering.
	
✓	Your Tempo: In this level, the song keeps playing, and it’s up to you to 
play the right notes with the right timing. If you make mistakes or miss 
the timing, the backing band slows down and makes things easier for 
you.
	
✓	Minus One: Now you’re on your own. You choose which hand(s) to 
play yourself, and you play the part while the band accompanies you. 
The display still shows you the notes to play (both on a staff and on the 
graphic of the keys) but the keyboard doesn’t wait or slow down or any­
thing. Use this mode when you think you’ve got the song down.
	
As technologies progress, sometimes terminology changes too. The preceding 
is how Yamaha termed things as of this book’s printing, but the company may 
well have changed some things since then.

Starting off by deciding what to work on
The Yamaha keyboards have a number of songs built in, and not all are good 
for the lesson function. The manual covers this topic, but basically you want 
to use the Piano Solo, Piano Ensemble, Piano Accompaniment, Classical, and 
Traditional Melodies for the lessons.
	
1.	To select a built-in song, press the Song mode button.
	
2.	Use any of the data entry controls (+/–, up/down, numeric keypad, or 
whatever) to select the song you want to learn.
	
A very cool feature of most Yamaha Y.E.S.-equipped keyboards is the ability 
to load in songs downloaded from the Internet or shared among friends in 
the Standard MIDI File (SMF) format. Yamaha has a large library of popular 
songs, classics, and more available to use with its lesson system. Visit

Playing Along with Recordings 
and Using Music Software
In This Chapter
▶	Hooking your music player up to your keyboard
▶	Breaking down the track into easy-to-figure-out elements
▶	Understanding how MIDI works
▶	Linking your keyboard with your computer or Apple iPad
▶	Enhancing your sound with music software
P

erhaps, like many people, you’ve decided to play keyboard because a 
performer, a group, or a song caught your attention and made you wish 
you could do that. So you get an instrument and the first thing you want to 
do is play that song to relive that initial dream. But you find out that to learn 
an instrument, you first have to do all this other stuff: Develop technique 
through exercises, learn to read music, read a For Dummies book to figure out 
how to . . . hey, wait a minute!
You should have the chance to get what you want from playing music. 
Learning to play by ear and figuring out music from recordings is the way 
to learn those all-important first-influence songs and is an important part 
of good musicianship. Every good musician masters these skills along with 
technique, reading, and style studies.
This chapter discusses playing with recordings and working out your favorite 
songs from them. It helps you get your music player and keyboard connected 
so you can hear both from the same headphone or speakers. It provides a lot 
of the methods and tips that the pros use to break down a song and easily 
play all the elements of it. And it acquaints you with some computer-based 
tools that make figuring out a song easier than it used to be.

566
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Computers, as you surely know, play an ever-increasing role in daily life. And 
so it is with music; you can integrate a computer or tablet device into your 
musical study, performance, and enjoyment in innumerable ways. The last 
section of this chapter goes over how MIDI works, helps you to connect your 
keyboard to your computer or iPad, and exposes you to the many types of 
software that you can use to enrich your music making, learning, and fun.
Exploring the Advantages 
of Playing Along
No doubt about it: Playing an instrument by yourself at home can be a bit 
lonely at times. Sure, it feels good to express yourself, to celebrate when you 
feel happy, or to cheer yourself up when you don’t. But after a while every­
one craves the company of others. At first, you may not feel good enough 
to play in front of people. And your early learning steps can sound kind of 
plain and often lack the full punch that a band or ensemble of musicians can 
provide.
An easy answer to this dilemma for the beginning musician is to play along 
with your favorite artists through their recordings. You don’t need to play a 
lot because you’re not replacing any member of the band (just yet!). You can 
add your part to the recording, whether that’s playing along with the melody, 
finding your own simple countermelodies, or just holding down some simple 
chords. Being part of that wonderful noise that is your favorite band or 
backing band will feel good.
Playing along with recordings has other, tangible benefits:
	
✓	It helps your time-keeping and feel. Being able to keep a steady beat is 
an important part of making music sound and feel good. You can learn 
how to count and you can play with a metronome, but to really get the 
feel of a piece or style of music, nothing beats playing along with musi­
cians who are experts at it.
	
✓	It’s easier for a beginner. If you don’t read music especially well, just 
poking around while a recording is playing can help you start to learn a 
song.
	
✓	It helps your musical ear. Musicians study something in school called 
ear training, which is the ability to hear notes, intervals (the distance 
between two notes), and chord qualities (major, minor, and so on) by 
ear. And the best practice for ear training is (wait for it) figuring out 
songs by playing along with recordings.

567

✓	It gives you a more complete version of the song. Printed music is 
often a simplified reduction of a song. Notating the actual feel of the 
rhythm would make it unnecessarily complicated, and parts are often 
simplified to make a songbook version easy to follow. Listening to and 
playing with the original recording can help fill in those instructions 
so you can feel and understand the music better. True story: A very 
famous jazz pianist was once presented with a detailed transcription 
of his playing, and he reacted by saying, “I can’t play this stuff; it looks 
too hard!” Yet it was something he had performed with ease by ear, 
experience, and feeling.
	
✓	It’s fun! If it’s a song or band that you love, why wouldn’t you want to be 
a part of it? You only need to play a little bit; let the original artist do the 
heavy lifting, and you’ll sound great and have a blast. Part of your music-
making should always be having fun!
Connecting an Audio Device to Your 
Keyboard to Hear Both Together
To play keyboard alongside your favorite song, of course, that song has to 
be playing on something. Many electronic keyboards have inputs for plugging 
another device (such as another instrument, a microphone, or a music player 
or iPod or phone) into them. This setup simplifies your cabling and con­
nections and lets you listen to both devices at the same time through head­
phones. This section helps you figure out how to hook up your music player 
of choice (or another audio device) to your keyboard so you can jam with the 
greats.
	
Get some good headphones. You want to be able to listen to the song very 
intently, and that’s best done with headphones on. If you’re going to be figur­
ing out a song, you’ll be repeating sections of it over and over (and over), 
which can get pretty annoying to other members of your household who can’t 
help but hear what you’re doing.
Finding a line input and getting connected
Take a look at the back panel of your keyboard for jacks labeled Line In, 
Audio In, Aux In, and so on. If your instrument has this kind of jack arrange­
ment, then connecting an audio player to it is no problem. If it doesn’t have 
the appropriate jack(s), skip to the next section.

568
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
With the jack located, you need to determine the right type of cable to use. 
Most portable CD players and all MP3 players have a stereo 1/8-inch (actu­
ally mini 3.5-millimeter) jack for the output. If your keyboard has a single jack 
labeled for input, you need a cable with a stereo 1/8-inch (3.5 millimeter) 
male plug on each end. This size plug is the most common one found on 
mobile phones, media players, and most earbud headphones. It’s available in 
mono and stereo versions, so be sure you have the stereo version, indicated 
by dual black rings near the tip of the plug.
	
The 3.5 millimeter plug makes a good connection, but can be a bit fragile. 
Always be careful not to tug on the cable or put pressure on this connection.
If your keyboard has dual inputs, they likely use 1/4-inch phone plugs (shown 
in Figure 5-1).
	
Figure 5-1:

for 1/4-inch

plugs.

At most stereo, music, and electronics stores, you can find cheap adapters 
that let you convert 1/8-inch connectors into 1/4-inch connectors and vice 
versa. So if you have the wrong connectors for what you’re trying to do, go get 
an adapter.
1/4-inch size is the most common plug used in musical instruments, mixing 
boards, and instrument amplifiers. It’s the largest plug used and makes a 
great connection because of its long shaft. It’s available in mono and stereo 
versions, so be sure you have the mono versions, indicated by single black 
rings near the tip of the plug.
To connect this kind of jack to your device, you need a cable that has a male 
1/8-inch stereo plug on one end and splits out into dual mono 1/4-inch male 
plugs on the other. You can find this Y cable in some electronic stores and 
online. Or use the adapter mentioned earlier.

569

Technology
Finally, if your keyboard has dual RCA inputs — round inputs with a raised 
ring with a deep hole in the middle — you’ll need a cable with a male 1/8-inch 
stereo plug on one end and dual RCA male plugs on the other. The RCA plug 
is commonly used in home stereo and home theatre audio/video products. It 
makes a great connection because its metal ring/shield fits securely over the 
jack on the device you’re plugging into.
	
With the music player connected, you should check your owner’s manual for 
instructions on setting the levels for the inputs and test out your connection 
by listening to some music through your keyboard (ideally on headphones).
No input? No worries: Moving 
forward with a mixer
If your keyboard doesn’t have dedicated inputs to connect your music player 
to, you need to use a device called a line mixer or mixer. A mixer combines 
multiple sources of audio and allows you to hear them all from a single set of 
outputs, such as headphones. Your music player likely has a stereo 1/8-inch 
(3.5-millimeter) output that needs to connect to the mixer; the keyboard 
probably has dual 1/4-inch or RCA outputs. Or you can use the single stereo 
headphone output (either 1/8-inch or 1/4-inch) to connect the keyboard to 
the mixer.
Mixers have inputs called channels, and these are usually mono. Because your 
device and keyboard have stereo outputs, your mixer needs two channels 
to connect your music player and another two channels for your keyboard. 
Therefore, you need a four-channel mixer. Some mixers have stereo channels 
(two inputs for one channel) or have stereo tape or aux inputs, so you can get 
by with fewer channels in these cases. Some two-channel micro mixers have 
a stereo 1/8-inch input for one channel and dual RCA inputs for the other 
channel, which would also covers your needs.
Bottom line: You have some options when it comes to mixer setup. As of this 
writing, there are models costing less than $60 that work with most standard 
keyboards and music players. Just be sure that the mixer has a headphone 
output (1/8-inch or 1/4-inch stereo jack; it may not specifically be labeled 
“headphones”). Figure 5-2 shows a small audio mixer that can be used to 
connect both a keyboard and an audio player device.

The cables you use to connect your keyboard and audio player to the mixer 
have male plugs on both ends, though what kinds of plugs those are depends 
on your specific equipment.
Getting in Tune
You may not realize it, but not every song is going to be perfectly in tune 
with your keyboard. Some older recordings were recorded a little bit slow 
or fast, and sometimes artists intentionally change the speed of a recording 
because they like how it makes their voice(s) sound. Fans of the Beatles are 
well aware of this fact; the band often played with playback speed intended 
to make its voices sound younger, deeper, or just different.
When you first pick a song to play along to, you may find that your keyboard 
sounds a little off. That’s a sure sign you need to adjust the tuning, which is 
almost always a small adjustment.
Look for a parameter called Master Tune or Fine Tune. You can find this 
setting in the Global (Korg), System (some Roland), Setting (some Casio), 
Function (Casio, Kurzweil, Roland, and Yamaha), or Utility (some Yamaha) 

571

Keyboard 
Technology
mode depending on your brand and model. This function allows you to 
slightly adjust the tuning of your keyboard up or down in very small incre­
ments. The tuning always defaults to A = 440.0 Hertz, which is the agreed-
upon tuning standard in most parts of the world. It means that the A note 
above middle C is pitched to 440 Hertz frequency. You can raise it to 440.1, 
440.2, and so on, or lower it to 439.9, 439.8 — you get the idea. You should 
find a note that you know is correct in the song and then repeat it over and 
over as you change this value until things sound better.
	
Don’t forget to reset this value back to 440.0 when you’re done playing along 
with that particular recording!
Figuring Out a Song You Don’t Know
For some people, playing a new song is an easy process. They can sit at a key­
board, hunt and peck around for a bit, and quickly find the notes of a melody. 
Some even have perfect pitch, where they just know what note a pitch is and 
can find it effortlessly. They recognize whether something is in perfect tune 
(and are greatly bothered when it isn’t).
Good for them. This section is for everyone else. Hearing pitches and chords 
and figuring out songs by ear is a skill, which means those not naturally 
inclined to it can still pick it up through practice. Of course, the more you 
know about scales, chords, and music theory (covered elsewhere in this 
book), the easier this process becomes, but the following sections help you 
get started without much of that knowledge.
Training your ear by trial and error
A good exercise to start developing your skills is to pick out simple nursery 
rhymes, holiday songs, and well-known melodies by ear. Just start at middle 
C on the keyboard and try to find the notes of some tune you know the sound 
of. Play the C and then figure out whether the next note of the song goes up 
or down from there or stays the same. If it moves, does it seem to be very 
close or very far? When you’ve figured one tune out, move to another starting 
note — say, the G above middle C — and try the same song again. Same 
melody, different keys on the keyboard.
Ready to move on to recordings? Pick really simple songs in the beginning. 
You need to develop some skills and gain confidence, so don’t start with 
tunes that are very long and complicated or require a level of technique that 
you’re not ready for. You need a lot of small victories during your develop­
ment; this positive reinforcement feels good and motivates you to move 
forward.

572
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
When you’ve picked out a song you want to learn, first listen to it over and 
over and immerse yourself in it. Listen without touching the keyboard or 
trying too hard to analyze the song. Get familiar with it so you can hum/sing 
the melody, tap out the groove on your steering wheel or desk, and recognize 
and anticipate the various section changes.
Next, just let it play a few times while you hunt and peck around the keys. Try 
to find a note or two that sound good for the beginning of the song. This step 
can help you to figure out what key it’s in and what scale fits the best. When 
you’ve found a note or two that sound good, try playing a major triad based 
on that note and then a minor triad from it. Which sounds more right? Major 
keys often sound happy, and minor keys sound sadder; do you get either 
feeling from the music?
Listening to a phrase to learn it
After you get a basic sense of the key or tonality of the song, your best bet is 
to break it into smaller chunks so you can focus on it in greater detail.
All music can be divided up into phrases, which are complete musical 
“thoughts” that have a beginning and end. These phrases can be easy to hear 
and feel; in vocal music, just follow the lyrics. Perhaps each sentence is a 
phrase, or you hear a couple of sentences and then a pause. The goal here is 
to work on these smaller segments one at a time.
	
Work on only a few bars of the tune at a time — certainly no more than eight.
As you play the short phrase over and over, you need to listen to one aspect 
of the music at a time. The main choices are as follows:
	
✓	Rhythm: This aspect can be the rhythm of the chords, the melody, or 
even the drums. You’re not worried about any notes yet; you just want 
to pay attention to how the notes/chords move around. How many 
chords occur per bar? Do the chords change only every few bars? How 
busy is the melody (how many notes per bar does it have)? What you’re 
doing is identifying targets that you’re going to figure out while playing, 
and you want to know how many you have and when they happen.
	
✓	Bass notes: Working out the bass notes is a good first step when it 
comes to notes. Finding the low notes, usually played by bass guitar or a 
pianist’s left hand, creates the building blocks of everything that comes 
later. In most music, the bass notes are the roots, or names of the chords 
being used, so finding them exposes a lot about the song. If you prefer 
starting with the melody, that’s perfectly fine, too.

573
 Chapter 5: Playing Along with Recordings and Using Music Software
Book VI
Exploring 
Electronic 
Keyboard 
Technology
	
	A really good tip is to sing the note you’re looking for. Sing the bass note 
along with the recording and stop the music right after the note while 
you keep singing the tone. Then search on the keyboard for the note 
you’re singing. You don’t have to be able to sing well — just well enough 
to match the pitch from your recording. Just remember that your head­
phones may contain the music from your keyboard and recording, but 
anyone within earshot will hear your singing.
	
✓	Basic chords: After you know the bass notes, try playing them as triad 
chords. Listen to hear whether a major or minor triad is the right choice. 
Some songs use a note other than the root of the chord in the bass, so 
if the root-based triad doesn’t sound right, think of the bass note as the 
fifth of a triad and try that. Still not right? Try it as the third of a chord.
	
	If major or minor doesn’t sound right, check out the fancier chords in 
Book III Chapter 6, like the diminished and augmented chords.
	
	Try to find one note that sounds good, like it’s part of the chord. Then 
look for another and then another until you build up the chord one note 
at a time.
	
✓	Melody: Because the melody is the most memorable part of a song, 
many people like to start with it. After all, most people can sing along 
with a song without knowing anything about chords and bass lines. Just 
sing the first note, find it at the keyboard, and you’re off and running!
	
Another thing that may help you break down phrases is to find other versions 
of the same song. If you have the album/studio version, go look for a live ver­
sion; it may have some of the parts more exposed because it has less studio 
production. Maybe you can find cover versions of the song by other artists. 
They may change parts of the song to make it their own, but a cover can be a 
good reference to better understand the song.
After you’ve figured out one phrase, move on to the next. When you’ve 
picked up all the phrases that make up the first part of the song, try to play 
them all together. Then start working on the chorus or main hook of the song. 
Keep working in these small sections until you’ve progressed through the 
whole song.
	
You may need to step away from a song after working for a while and refresh 
your ears and your brain. Don’t force it. Put it away for a day or a few days and 
then come back to it. You’ll often find that you hear something more clearly 
and can finish a section that had been causing you endless frustration.
Using your computer to help
Playing the music file on a computer rather than a CD player or MP3 player is 
easy and has some real advantages. Simply hook up the audio output of your 
computer to the inputs of your keyboard or to a mixer as mentioned in the 

574
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
earlier section “Connecting an Audio Device to Your Keyboard to Hear Both 
Together.” It’s no different than using those other devices, so you can still 
work with headphones. Here’s where computers have the upper hand:
	
✓	Repeatedly relocating to a section: Whatever music player application 
you use, it will have better controls for relocating to a specific spot in 
the tune than a physical player does. Computer applications that have a 
timeline/progress bar make moving your mouse to a visual location easy 
to do.
	
✓	Emphasizing a frequency range with EQ: Most music player apps have 
some form of equalization built in, and you can use it to help hear parts 
more clearly. Boost the low frequencies when you’re figuring out the 
bass notes; you can even bring down the levels on the high notes to 
help further remove them from your attention. When you’re figuring out 
chords, you can boost some mid-range frequency to help you hear the 
harmony better. Try one EQ band at a time to find the one that helps 
emphasize the chords the most.
	
	Many times what you want to do is get the drums out of your way, so 
lowering some frequency bands can help. Lower highs to remove cymbal 
noise, lessen the lows to remove a strong bass drum, and so on.
	
✓	Using special audio applications: Audio applications are programs 
for recording or editing speech and music. They often let you loop, or 
repeat a section of the song over and over. You can set when to start 
and when to loop back, so you can play however many bars you need to 
work on over and over without have to manually reset the player every 
time. Audio applications often can set several of these markers, so you 
can set up loops for the verse, the chorus, the bridge, the solo section, 
and so on.
	
	Some audio applications allow you to slow down the speed of a piece of 
music without changing the pitch. This is called time-stretching, and it 
can be the best tool you ever invest in for learning songs. It’s like asking 
the band or your teacher to play the song for you very slowly so you can 
watch and listen to what she’s doing. Slowing down a song by around 
25 percent or so sounds pretty good; any further than that and it starts 
to sound funny (though you can still tell the pitch of the notes). Time-
stretching is invaluable in helping you to figure out fast passages and 
riffs in the music — check out later in this chapter for some options.
	
	Finally, some applications are specifically designed for learning songs 
from recordings. This process is called transcribing, which is the act of 
committing a live performance or recording to musical notation. These 
applications offer a simple interface for playing music files and include 
time-stretching capabilities, EQ, and easy-to-use location markers (more 
details later in this chapter). They’re well worth the small cost for all 
they bring to this activity.

575

Technology
	
Another way you can use your computer to help: Search for videos of people 
teaching the song on the Internet. With resources such as YouTube, you can 
often find other musicians teaching how to play popular songs. It may be a 
guitar lesson, but the player will still name the chords and talk about the 
melody. It’s not cheating to get some help. Everybody learns from 
others — even, or perhaps especially, the greats.
The Computer Connection: Using Software 
to Enhance Your Music-Making
Every keyboard made since the mid-’80s has a connection on the back called 
MIDI, which stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. This round jack 
with five pin connections revolutionized keyboard playing and music making 
by providing a way for all keyboards to “talk” to each other. First developed as 
a way of layering keyboards together, the MIDI language sent messages between 
the connected devices, so when you played one keyboard the same notes and 
performance gestures were sent to another keyboard for instant triggering.
From this humble beginning, MIDI grew into a more detailed language that 
enabled musicians to use computers for storing the settings for sounds from 
their keyboard, editing those sounds by using a larger graphic interface, 
recording and editing the MIDI-based performances, mixing music, control­
ling stage lighting, and many other activities. MIDI forever changed the way 
music is made, and its inventors received a Technical Grammy Award in 2013 
for their achievement. Every company making electronic musical instruments 
uses MIDI in some way; when you see MIDI listed as a feature on a product, 
you can be guaranteed that it will work with other MIDI devices and with 
various types of music software.
How MIDI works: Explaining common 
MIDI messages
MIDI sends various messages that describe what you’re doing at the key­
board. Play a note, and it transmits which note you play, how hard you play 
it, how long you hold it, whether you use the sustain pedal to hold the note, 
whether you move any other controllers on the keyboard (the mod wheel, a 
slider, a switch), and more. Without getting too technical, here are the main 
types of messages that MIDI represents:
	
✓	Note Number: Note Number is the pitch or note you’re playing. MIDI 
allows for 128 possible notes — many more than are even found on a 
piano keyboard! Each octave of a keyboard has a number, so notes are 
represented like C4, F3, A0, E♭5, and so on. The range goes from C1 to C9.

576
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
	
✓	Note On/Note Off: These two commands indicate when you start a note 
and when you let go of the key. Taken together, they define the length of 
time you hold the note for.
	
	Just like on a piano, a note can keep ringing after you let go of a key if 
you’re holding down a sustain pedal. MIDI accounts for this situation as 
well, so a sustain pedal message will override a Note Off command when 
necessary, keeping the note ringing until you let go of the sustain pedal.
	
✓	Velocity: Velocity indicates how hard you play the note. It’s called 
velocity and not force (for example) because it measures the time the 
key takes to leave its top point of contact and reach the bottom point of 
contact. That speed or timing translates into a dynamic because playing 
more forcefully moves the key to the bottom more quickly than playing 
more softly does.
	
✓	Control Change: Control Change is a broad selection of messages that 
define some other modifying action. These controllers can represent 
a continually moving motion (like moving a wheel, knob, or slider) 
or a single status, like the toggling of a switch on or off. A number of 
these messages are strictly defined; for example, Control Change (CC) 
#7 always represents volume, such as the volume knob or slider on 
an audio device or mixer. Note: Pitch Bend and aftertouch are consid­
ered special messages and aren’t within the Control Change range of 
messages.
	
✓	MIDI channel: MIDI offers 16 channels of communication, so a single 
output can send different messages to different devices at the same 
time. Only the keyboard(s) set to listen to a given channel respond 
to those messages, so multipart music can easily be transmitted and 
reproduced. A keyboard that can listen to multiple MIDI channels at 
once is called multitimbral.
	
✓	MIDI port: To further increase the size of the MIDI network or group, 
a keyboard can have more than one MIDI port to communicate on. 
Each port adds another 16 channels to communicate on. These can be 
physical inputs and outputs on a device or software ports all available 
over the same USB port. They’re usually named A, B, and so on.
	
✓	Program Change: This message is used to call up a specific sound on 
a keyboard or module. It simply represents a memory location in the 
device; any sound may be stored there. There are 128 possible Program 
Change values.
	
✓	Bank Select: To expand the number of programs that can be called up, a 
group of 128 programs is considered a bank, and products can have up to 
128 banks. 128 possible banks × 128 program locations = 16,384 sounds. 

577

Technology
(Hopefully, that’s enough for you.) You select a new sound in a different 
bank from the current one by sending the Bank Select message followed 
by a Program Change number.
	
✓	System Exclusive: Keyboards have many things that aren’t common and 
can’t be standardized by a specification such as MIDI. These items are 
most often the parameters of the type of synthesis and other special 
features. System Exclusive messages are defined by each manufacturer 
to manipulate and store all these individual things. This type of message 
can only be heard and responded to by that specific brand and model 
of keyboard. They are most often used for the editing and storage of 
sounds for a given keyboard.
	
All these messages are how keyboards and other sound-producing devices, 
like drum machines and sound modules, talk to each other. MIDI grew into a 
recording technology as well, so messages also exist for tempo; start, stop, 
and continue controls for operating a recorder; and many other functions. You 
can read more about MIDI recording in Book VI Chapter 3.
Examining MIDI ports
MIDI connectors on a keyboard are usually DIN connectors You have separate 
in and out connections; one device transmits via an Out, and another device 
listens or receives the messages via an In (see Figure 5-3). The hardware looks 
the same, so be careful when connecting devices. (You won’t harm your 
­keyboard if you connect them wrong; it simply won’t pass the MIDI signal.)

connectors.

Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
	
You may see a third MIDI port labeled Thru; this port just passes on whatever 
signal comes to the In. This option is a way of connecting multiple devices in a 
chain, passing the signal from the first to the second to the third and so on.
More and more modern keyboards are transmitting MIDI over a USB port 
and may or may not have the traditional DIN ports as well. The USB port is 
bidirectional; it can send and receive messages over the same cable. The port 
is likely not labeled MIDI; it just says USB and possibly To Host as shown in 
Figure 5-4. Study up on your keyboard to find out whether it supports MIDI 
USB functionality.

The most common misconception about MIDI is that it passes the audio 
signal between devices. People often connect two devices together via MIDI 
and then are confused when they can’t hear them. MIDI only sends control-
type messages between the devices; you have to connect the device to a 
speaker, mixer, or even headphones to hear the sound. It’s like the devices 
are being played in real time, so they need to be monitored the same as if you 
were playing the keys.
Connecting Your Keyboard 
to Your Computer
You can hook up a MIDI keyboard to any type of computer: tower or laptop, 
Mac or PC. The main consideration is what type of MIDI jacks your keyboard 
has. If they are the round DIN connectors, you need to use a MIDI interface; if 
they’re USB, you need only the correct cable. (See the preceding section for 
more on connector types.)

If you’re trying to connect to a computer that doesn’t offer USB, get a new 
computer! USB became popular in the late ’90s, which is considered the Stone 
Age for computer technology. You won’t find any MIDI/music software that’s 
supported on such an old system, so getting connected will only be the 
beginning of your troubles.
Using a direct USB connection
This setup is the simplest situation; all you need is a common USB device 
cable, as pictured in Figure 5-5. (It’s the standard connection cable most USB 
devices use.) It has the USB Type B square connector on one end, which gets 
plugged into your keyboard, and the small, rectangular USB Type A connector 
on the other end, which connects to your computer.
	
Figure 5-5:

Utilizing a MIDI interface
If your keyboard only has traditional DIN jacks, then you need some sort of 
MIDI interface. A MIDI interface is a box that offers a USB port to connect to 
your computer (the USB Type B/To Host connector, so you can use a USB 
device cable) and some number of DIN-based MIDI In and Out ports. The 
simplest MIDI interface is actually a cable that has DIN-based MIDI In and Out 
plugs on one end and a USB Type A plug on the other, as shown in Figure 5-6. 
This setup is fine to use if you have only one keyboard to connect to your com­
puter. Just be sure to measure how far away the keyboard is from the computer 
because these cables are usually only available in 6-foot to 10-foot lengths.

580

If you have more than one keyboard (or device) or you think you’ll be adding 
more later, buying a MIDI interface with more than one set of In and Out ports 
makes sense. Smaller interfaces may offer two In ports and two Out ports 
(such as the one in Figure 5-7), and larger ones commonly supply more out­
puts than inputs — for example two In and eight Out. Unless you’re planning 
a large home studio with a lot of hardware synths and keyboards, you prob­
ably can get by with a two-In, two-Out interface.
Some MIDI interfaces get their power through the USB connection on your 
computer, which is fine if you don’t have a lot of USB devices (printer, mouse, 
QWERTY keyboard, webcam, and so on). However, if you do rack up a lot 
of USB usage, consider getting an interface that has its own power adapter, 
especially if you use a laptop. Another option is to get a powered USB hub. 
Simple USB hubs can give you a few more ports to connect devices to, 
but they still rely on the computer to power them all, and often it can’t. A 
­powered hub is the only solution.

Many USB audio interfaces (used for recording audio into your computer, as 
discussed in Book VI Chapter 3) also include MIDI ports, so if you’re planning 
to add one of those as well, you can save money and clutter/hassle by getting 
these two functions in one box.
After you have your MIDI interface, the cable connections are simple:
	
✓	USB device cable between interface and computer
	
✓	MIDI Out of your keyboard to MIDI In of the interface
	
✓	The matching MIDI Out of the interface back to the MIDI In of your 
keyboard.
So that’s three cables needed, one USB and two MIDI.
Working with drivers and plug-and-play
It would be nice if, after you connected cables and devices, things just 
worked. But life, especially technology, just doesn’t work that way. You need 
to take a few steps to finish configuring your system before you can start 
using music software and having fun. It’s different for each operating system, 
as you may expect.

582
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
	
Here are a couple of hints that apply to both Mac and PC hookups:
	
✓	Go to the manufacturer’s website and look for the latest driver there. 
Often the materials packed in the box are old and usually don’t get revised 
until the company runs out of the pressed CDs. So the version in the box 
may be very old indeed. The newest drivers are always free for download.
	
✓	To test whether the interface you’ve installed is working, try online utilities. 
On a Mac, try the free utility called MIDI Monitor; for a PC, try the free utility 
MIDI-OX. (They may be free, but please consider donating some money to 
the authors for their hard work.) Search for these programs on the web; 
they’re easy to install and show you whatever MIDI messages are coming 
into the computer and what is going out. They’re perfect for quickly con­
firming that things are working without running a music application and 
are great for learning what messages your keyboard is transmitting.
On a Mac
If you’re using an Apple computer, you likely don’t need any other special 
software to make the interface work. But check the technical documents that 
came with your keyboard; some companies do have special MIDI drivers for 
the Mac that need to be installed.
Next, you need to run a utility that comes as part of OSX called Audio MIDI 
Setup. Look for it under Applications > Utilities. If you have everything 
connected and powered on when you run this application, it will scan your 
system and locate and identify all the devices connected. Figure 5-8 shows 
my setup in the application, with both a dedicated audio/MIDI interface with 
nothing currently connected to it (AudioBox 22VSL) and a Casio stage piano 
connected directly via USB. With a direct USB device you don’t need to do 
anything else; after the system scans and finds it, your keyboard will be avail­
able to work with any application you run.

If you’re using a MIDI interface, the scan will show it. If a keyboard is con­
nected to it via regular MIDI cables, it will likely work but won’t show up as 
an icon and won’t be fully configured. If you do nothing else, things will work, 
but your MIDI software won’t show your keyboard by name when choosing 
a new track to record, for example. You can click on the Add Device icon 
at the top of the screen and manually configure your keyboard to fix this 
issue. Double-click on the new external device icon that was created, give 
it a name, and see whether it’s already supported in the drop-down lists 
for Manufacturer and Model. Then connect the keyboard icon to the inter­
face icon by dragging from the arrows to create virtual cables (as shown in 
Figure 5-9) and you’re set.
On a PC
If you’re using a PC/Windows-based computer, you need to install drivers. 
A few things to keep in mind:
	
✓	Don’t believe it when your computer just tells you it “installed” the 
device after you plug it in. This function is the so-called plug-and-play 
that products promote, but it never works for MIDI interfaces or key­
boards. Read the documentation that came with your keyboard about 
installing the software drivers and follow the steps carefully.

Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
	
✓	Don’t connect the MIDI interface before installing the drivers. The 
installation process will prompt you when to connect it; read and follow 
the instructions carefully.
	
✓	Always put the MIDI interface on the same USB port you used when 
installing the drivers. Thousands of hours of customer support and 
customer confusion have been caused by this little-known fact: Any 
device drivers installed on a PC work only for the port used during the 
installation. So if you unplug the device and later plug it into a different 
port, the device won’t work.
Hooking Up to Your iPad
The Apple iPad has a growing number of music applications available and is 
becoming a favorite tool and toy for musicians around the world. To connect 
your MIDI keyboard to it, you have a few choices.
As with most technology, a new edition of the iPad seems to come out every 
five minutes, so you may be working with one of several versions. If you have 
the original or second or third generation iPad, you have a 30-pin connector 
on the bottom edge of the device. You need an Apple Camera Connection Kit, 
which plugs into that port and provides a USB jack. Plug in and you’re ready 
to go.
If you have the fourth generation iPad or the iPad Mini (or even newer 
models), you have what is called a Lightning connector. These models already 
come with a cable in the box to connect USB devices to the Lightning jack, so 
you’re all set.
If your keyboard has only DIN connectors, you need a MIDI interface to use 
your iPad. (Flip to the earlier sections “Examining MIDI ports” and “Utilizing 
a MIDI interface” for details on DIN connectors and general purpose MIDI 
interfaces, respectively.) But for the iPad, you need a special MIDI interface 
that supports the unique connectors the tablet uses. A number of companies 
make dedicated iPad interface cables that support the 30-pin connector of 
the older models, with MIDI In and Out plugs on the other end of the cable. 
For the newer, Lightning-based models, you can buy an adapter cable with 
the 30-pin jack on one end and a Lightning connector on the other. Then you 
can use any of the available iOS interfaces. (iOS is Apple’s mobile operating 
system.)

585
 Chapter 5: Playing Along with Recordings and Using Music Software

You can find a smaller adapter that converts the Lightning jack to a 30-pin 
jack, but this option leaves you with two bulky connectors hanging off your 
iPad. That setup is risky, both in terms of coming disconnected and of 
straining or even breaking the connector on your expensive toy. Better to get 
the cable instead.
No drivers or other setup software is required to use MIDI keyboards and 
music apps on the iPad. Plug in your keyboard and start up an app, and 
you’re ready to play and have fun.
Exploring Popular Types 
of Music Software
Music software has been commercially available since the mid-’80s and 
provides all sorts of cool things to enhance your music making. The following 
sections divide these options into easy-to-understand groups to give you a 
brief peek into the wonderful possibilities that await you.
Sequencer/MIDI recorder
This category, commonly called a digital audio workstation (DAW), is a 
recording studio in a box. MIDI is the language you’ll likely be using to play 
into these applications, but they all actually record audio and cover editing, 
mixing, and outputting final files that you can make CDs from, post files to the 
web, and share for fun or profit.
They come in many different designs. Some DAWs are designed to emulate 
the linear tape concept, with tracks that you record from beginning to end. 
Others take a more modular or chunk-style approach to music making, where 
you create small sections, or patterns, and then arrange them in any order 
you like. This method is often used in a live performance like when a DJ cues 
up different songs. Some DAWs combine these two approaches.
Many DAWs include software instruments and sounds, so you can get new 
sounds, often using technologies that your keyboard may not offer. Getting 
a DAW is like buying additional keyboards along with your recording studio. 
Some companies offer entry-level versions of their programs, which you can 

586
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
later upgrade up to the fuller-featured versions when you’re ready for more. 
If your keyboard offers no recording function or only limited features, this 
category is a great one to consider and explore.
Popular DAWs include these:
	
✓	Ableton Live (Mac and Windows)
	
✓	Apple GarageBand (Mac only) — good for beginners as well!
	
✓	Apple Logic Pro (Mac only)
	
✓	Avid Pro Tools (Mac and Windows)
	
✓	Cakewalk Sonar (Windows only)
	
✓	Cockos Reaper (Mac and Windows)
	
✓	Image-Line FL Studio (Windows only)
	
✓	MOTU Digital Performer (Mac and Windows)
	
✓	PreSonus Studio One (Mac and Windows)
	
✓	Propellerhead Reason (Mac and Windows)
	
✓	Steinberg Cubase (Mac and Windows)
	
✓	Steinberg Sequel (Mac and Windows) — good for beginners as well!
Popular iPad DAWs include the following:
	
✓	Apple GarageBand — good for beginners as well!
	
✓	Beepstreet iSequence
	
✓	FL Studio Mobile
	
✓	4Pockets Meteor
	
✓	Intua Beatmaker
	
✓	Steinberg Cubasis
	
✓	Xewton Music Studio
	
✓	Yamaha Mobile Music Sequencer
	
Another type of software is play along or backing tracks, where you give the 
software a chord progression and it generates backing parts (drums, bass, 
chords, and so on) so you can play along with it. Some DAWs have this type of 
functionality. The most popular software with this capability is PG Music’s 
Band-In-A-Box (Mac and Windows).

Educational/learning software
A number of software titles can teach you how to play piano/keyboards (or 
even guitar or drums). You can study reading music, learn music theory, work 
on your ear training, study the works of famous composers, and much more.
The beauty this kind of software is that it’s always ready to go when you are and 
is infinitely patient; you can move at your own speed. Working with a human 
certainly has its benefits, but educational software can be a great companion to 
traditional studies and lessons. The market has too many titles to list here, but 
look for software from the following companies and programs as a start:
	
✓	Computer:
 
• Adventus
 
• Alfred Publishing
 
• Ars Nova
 
• Harmonic Vision
 
• Piano Marvel
 
• Playground Sessions
 
• Sibelius
	
✓	iPad/iPhone:
 
• Electric Peel Note-A-Lator
 
• Karajan Beginner, Pro Music, and Ear Trainer
 
• Musictheory.net Theory Lessons and Tenuto
 
• My Rhythm HD
 
• Nitrovery Rhythm
 
• Polyrhythm
 
• Rhythm Sight Reading Trainer
	
You can find a number of metronome apps that run on the iPad or your 
smartphone — very handy! Metronome Plus is very full-featured for a free app. 
The Pro (paid) version of ProMetronome is really great.
	
As mentioned earlier, computer software tools for transcribing songs you want 
to play along to are handy because they can slow down the speed of the music 
without changing the pitch, repeat sections you choose, and make many 
markers in the song file for easy location of your favorite parts. Examples 
include Roni Music’s Amazing Slow Downer (Mac, Windows, and iPad) and 

588
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
Seventh String Software’s Transcribe! (Mac and Windows). A newer website, 
http://jammit.com, offers real backing tracks, which you can isolate or 
remove to learn how to play songs from the site’s ever-growing library.
Music notation software
Gone are the days when a composer dipped his quill pen into ink and wrote 
out his music on manuscript paper. Well, okay, quill pens were gone by the 
early 1900s, but with the advent of the computer, preparing a musical score 
or a simple pop tune has never been easier. Just as the computer took over 
printing and publishing, it has become the de facto standard for music 
engraving.
Many music notation programs can record MIDI and instantly convert it to 
notation; though not perfect, this process can be much faster than placing 
notes one at a time onto a staff. After you enter notes, you can edit and 
manipulate them with the same flexibility that you do letters within a word 
processor. Notation software often has sounds built-in so you can hear your 
music played back from the computer with no other instruments connected. 
Many of the available packages are designed for the serious composer and 
arranger and may seem far too deep at first glance for the casual player. But 
even those programs have “lite” versions or offer easy templates to work 
from. The main notation computer titles are as follows:
	
✓	Avid Sibelius (Mac and Windows)
	
✓	Avid Sibelius First (Mac and Windows)
	
✓	DG Software MagicScore Maestro (Windows)
	
✓	DoReMIR ScoreCleaner (Mac and Windows)
	
✓	Lugert Verlag Forte (Windows)
	
✓	Make Music Finale and Finale Notepad (Mac and Windows)
	
✓	Make Music Print Music (Mac and Windows)
	
✓	MuseScore (free; Mac and Linux)
	
✓	Notion Music Notion (Mac and Windows)
Popular iPad titles include Gargant Studios Reflow and Notion Music Notion.

589

Technology
Digital sheet music
Digital sheet music is a subset of notation software; these programs are 
for viewing music scores or buying sheet music/songbooks, not creating 
them. You can just view scores as graphic files (like a JPEG, TIFF, or PDF), 
but a dedicated program can offer easier viewing (better page turning, for 
example) and more features. This activity is well covered by the music 
notation programs on the computer (see the preceding section), but it’s a 
growing field for the iPad and tablet computers. Popular iPad titles include 
the following:
	
✓	Avid Scorch (only works with Sibelius and PDF files)
	
✓	Deep Dish Designs DeepDish GigBook
	
✓	Leoné MusicReader PDF (also available as Mac and PC software)
	
✓	Make Music Finale Songbook (free; only works with Finale files)
	
✓	MGS Development forScore
	
✓	UnReal Book
Additional instruments/sounds
This field is huge in both computer and iPad development. Software 
synthesizers are at the forefront of synthesis development and technologies, 
offering both models of classic synths from years gone by and new, powerful 
designs. Software sample-players have the largest memory (often reading 
the samples off the drive in real time, virtually eliminating the need to worry 
about memory size), and the most advanced feature sets and designs. Most 
of the major advancements in sample-playback technology happen in software 
instruments, and many companies create sounds libraries for these players.
Most major DAWs include some software synthesizers and often a sample-
player engine. The main software sample-players for computers are as follows; 
all are compatible with both Mac and Windows unless otherwise noted:
	
✓	Ableton Sampler
	
✓	Apple Logic’s EXS24 (included in Logic Pro – Mac)

590
Book VI: Exploring Electronic Keyboard Technology 
	
✓	Avid Pro Tool’s Structure
	
✓	IK Multimedia SampleTank
	
✓	MOTU MachFive
	
✓	Native Instrument’s Kontakt and Battery
	
✓	Propellerhead Reason’s NN-XT (included in Reason – Mac and Windows)
	
✓	Steinberg Halion
Some of the companies that make sound libraries offer their own player 
engines, but these players are usually only able to play sounds from that 
company. Examples include East West’s Play engine, Garritan’s Aria player, 
and Best Service’s ENGINE.
On iPad, the choices are more limited because memory is much smaller. Top 
titles include the following:
	
✓	Akai iMPC
	
✓	Bismark bs-16i
	
✓	IK Multimedia SampleTank
	
✓	Samplr
Software instruments are commonly called virtual instruments or VIs. You can 
divide software instruments into a few general categories:
	
✓	Re-creations of classic synths: These VIs are accurate emulations of 
famous synths, often analog legends from the ’70s and ’80s. Most are 
modeled, but some are digital synthesis, and some are based on sample-
playback technology.
	
✓	Models/emulations of well-known acoustic and electro-mechanical 
instruments: This category includes most sampled pianos; modeled 
tonewheel organs; clavs and electric pianos; and modeled guitars, brass, 
and woodwinds.
	
✓	Imaginative new synths: This broad area includes fuller-featured 
­versions based on classic analog synthesis, as well as hybrid 
­technologies and completely new and fresh forms of synthesis.

Accessing the Audio Tracks
S

ometimes, reading about a concept and trying to practice it just doesn’t 
cut it — you need to hear it, too. Wherever you see the “PlayThis!” icon 
in this book, you’ll find references to audio tracks that demonstrate various 
musical pieces, audio effects, instrument samples, and more. Several of the 
audio tracks play a tune for your reference, so you can see the printed music 
and hear it at the same time. This appendix provides you with a handy list of 
all the audio tracks referenced throughout the book.
So, where are these audio tracks and how do you get them? They’re on the 
Internet, at www.dummies.com/go/pianokeyboardaio/.
