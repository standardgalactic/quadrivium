How to proceed?
P(response | stimulus)
Our problem is one of dimensionality!
We want to sample the responses of the system to
many stimuli so we can characterize what it is about 
the input that triggers responses.
P(response | stimulus) P(response | s1)

NOT FOR REUSE
Start with a very high dimensional description
(eg. an image or a time-varying waveform)
and pick out a small set of relevant dimensions.

What is the right stimulus to use?
P(response | stimulus) P(response | s1, s2, .., sn)
One common and useful method is to use 
white noise
We want to sample the responses of the system to
a variety of stimuli so we can characterize what it is about 
the input that triggers responses.
