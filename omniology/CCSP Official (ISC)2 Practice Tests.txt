For Robin, again, for making this year possible

Acknowledgments
The author would like to thank various biological entities for their assistance in bringing 
this work to completion. First, Jim Minatel, perhaps the best editor anyone could ever 
have. Jim has ridiculous thresholds of patience and encouragement, a perfectly dry wit, 
and professional experience and knowledge that should make other editors whimper and 
hide in the dark places they belong. Kelly Talbot has similar amounts of patience, which 
have served to make him the ﬁnest of editors. He had to endure completely outrageous 
treatment in the form of writer behavior bordering on assault and prose that is perhaps 
only as interesting to someone outside the information security realm as paint thinner 
(and even paint thinner fumes have arguably medicinal qualities, which this book sorely 
lacks). Judy Flynn is a wickedly sharp editor and may, in fact, be a cyborg programmed 
with thesaurus capabilities. The amount of ﬁxing she had to do to make this book read-
able is extraordinary, and she cannot be thanked enough. Katie Wisor’s technological 
support efforts were unparalled, and her whimsical tolerance for the author’s capricious 
attitude toward the editing process cannot be appreciated enough. The technical reviewers  
Bill Burke, Trevor Chandler, Aaron Kraus, Valerie Michelle Nelson, Brian O’Hara, and 
Jordan Pike were utterly amazing. They caught mistakes and pointed out pitfalls that 
caused the author to blush and cringe. More important, they made suggestions that have 
improved this work beyond measure, for which the author is humbled and utterly grateful. 
Finally, the author’s partner, Robin (getting a doubleplusgood nod to go with the dedi-
cation of this book), for her own efforts to mollify and assuage the author as necessary 
during production, and the dog, Jake, who may have often expressed discontent when the 
author sat down at the keyboard but was just as pleased to jump up in delight when  
the author arose again.

Introduction
There is no magic formula for passing the CCSP certiﬁcation exam. You can, however, 
prepare yourself for the challenge. This book is all about preparation.
We’ve included 1,000 questions related to the CCSP material in this book, which 
also includes access to the online databank (the same questions, but in a point-and-
click format). They were created in accordance with the (ISC)2 CCSP Common Body 
of Knowledge (CBK), the CCSP Training Guide, the CCSP Study Guide, and the CCSP 
Detailed Content Outline (DCO), which lists all the elements of practice that the candidate 
is expected to know for the certiﬁcation.
How This Book Is Organized
The questions have been arranged in the order of the CBK, with varying amounts in  
proportion to (ISC)2 published matrix describing how the exam is constructed, as shown 
in Table I.1.
TA B L E   I .1   How the Exam Is Constructed

3. Cloud Platform and Infrastructure Security

4. Cloud Application Security

5. Operations

6. Legal and Compliance

There are six chapters, one for each of the CBK domains; each chapter contains a frac-
tion of 750 practice questions, reﬂecting the percentage of questions from the respective 
domain on the exam (for example, Chapter 1 reﬂects Domain 1 of the CBK and has 143 
questions). There are also two full-length practice exams, 125 questions each, at the end of 
the book (Chapters 7 and 8).

Introduction
Who Should Read This Book
This book is intended for CCSP candidates. In order to earn the CCSP, you are expected 
to have professional experience in the ﬁeld of information security/IT security, particularly 
experience related to cloud computing. The candidate will also need to provide evidence of 
their professional experience to (ISC)2 in the event of passing the exam.
The author has drawn on his own experience studying for and passing the exam as well 
as years of teaching the CISSP and CCSP preparation courses for (ISC)2. He also solicited 
feedback from colleagues and former students who have taken the prep course and the 
exam. The book should reﬂect the breadth and depth of question content you are likely to 
see on the exam. Some of the questions in this book are easier than what you will see on 
the exam; some of them may be harder. Hopefully, the book will prepare you for what you 
might encounter when you take the test.
The one thing we chose not to simulate in the book is the “interactive” questions; (ISC)2 
has stated that the current tests may go beyond the regular multiple-choice format and 
could include “matching” questions (a list of multiple answers and multiple terms, where 
the candidate has to arrange them all in order), drag-and-drop questions (where the candi-
date uses the mouse to arrange items on the screen), and “hot spot” questions (where the 
candidate puts the mouse on areas of the screen to indicate an answer). There will probably 
not be many of these on the exam you take, but they are weighted more in your score than 
the multiple-choice questions, so pay attention and be extra careful answering those.
Tools You Will Need
In addition to this book, we recommend the CCSP (ISC)2 Certiﬁed Cloud Security Profes-
sional Ofﬁcial Study Guide (O’Hara, Malisow), also from Wiley (2017). There is, as stated 
in the introduction, no magic formula for passing the exam. No single particular book/
source with all the answers to the exam exists. If someone claims to be able to provide you 
with such a product, please realize that they are mistaken or, worse, misleading you.
However, you can augment your studying by reviewing a signiﬁcant portion of the likely 
sources used by the professionals who created the test. The following is a just a sampling of 
the possible professional resources the cloud practitioner should be familiar with:

To practice in an online testing version of the same questions, go to www.wiley.com/go/ 
sybextestprep and register your book to get access to the Sybex Test Platform. Online you 
can mix questions from the domain chapters and practice exams, take timed tests, and have 
your answers graded.
Summary
As you go through the questions in this book, please remember the abbreviation RTFQ, 
which is short for “read the full question.” There is no better advice you can possibly receive 
than this. Read every word of every question. Read every possible answer before selecting 
the one you like. The exam is 125 questions over four hours. You have more than enough 
time to consider each question thoroughly. There is no cause for hurry. Make sure you un-
derstand what the question is asking before responding.
Good luck on the exam. We’re hoping this book helps you pass.

 84. You are the security manager for an online retail sales company with 100 employees and 
a production environment hosted in a PaaS model with a major cloud provider. Your 
company policies have allowed for a bring your own device (BYOD) workforce that work
