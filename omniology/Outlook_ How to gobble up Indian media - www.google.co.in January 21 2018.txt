B
AJI Rao II was a defeated man, a shadow of a Peshwa, having been a puppet 
since the 1802 treaty of Bassein with the British. So, the battle of Koregaon 
wasn’t really big—either for the British Empire or the many Indian communi-
ties, including the Mahars, which comprised the Bombay Native Infantry of 
the British East India Company. The epoch-making battle that gave primacy 
to the British on the west coast was the battle of Srirangapatna that ended on 
May 4, 1799. A grenadier of the Bombay Army (could even have been a Mahar) shot 
through the temple of the Tiger of Mysore. If at all Mahar valour has to be exempli-
fied, I would choose May 4 instead of January 1, because even in British documents 
the siege of Mangalore in 1783 by Tipu and the battle of Srirangapatna are much big-
ger events than Koregaon, where just about 50 soldiers of the Bombay Army died. In 
fact, the Bombay Native Infantry, about which some politicians are getting emotio-
nal, was one of the deadliest forces set against Indian kings like Tipu Sultan. 
Earlier, Tipu Sultan’s father Hyder Ali was defeated by 
the Madras army—which was, composition-wise, 12 per 
cent Dalit (Pariah). They even snatched Hyder’s cavalry 
standard and it bec ame part of their regimental colours. 
The same army was part of the forces that had def e ated 
the Marathas in 1803 in the battle of Assaye. So, to cele-
brate Pariah valour, shouldn’t we re-enact the 1781 battle 
of Sholingur against Hyder Ali, the battle of Assaye against 
the Marathas and the many battles against Tipu? While 
celebrating all these colonial victories against small Ind-
ian kings, there is one campaign which brings a lot of sor-
row to an average Malayali, that is the Bombay and Madras armies’ victory over a 
small king of Malabar and his Nair and Kurichiya (now a scheduled tribe) soldiers in 
Wayanad. So, while we celebrate the Mahar valour against Kerala Varma, the Raja of 
Pazhassi, are we allowed to shed tears for the Kurichiyas? Or is it casteist to do so? 
This is nothing but an absurd, comical attempt to relive a British policy meant to 
divide Indians. Gandhi’s 1932 fast in Poona, if that act is to be read in its fullness, was 
not against Ambedkar, but against the British idea of separate electorates for Mus-
lims, Sikhs, Anglo-Indians, Indian Christians and Scheduled Castes. So, it made a lot 
of sense for the British to choose Koregaon as a symbol of Dalit assertion instead of 
Srirangapatna or Sholingur or Wayanad. But it doesn’t make any sense for mod-
ern-day Dalit leaders to celebrate British victories because the British were worse 
than India’s privileged castes in keeping the Dalits in chains. For instance, it was the 
British who made manual scavenging by a certain caste lawful in the army, the rail-
ways and the municipalities. If Churchill had so willed, Bezwada Wilson’s family 
would not have been manual scavengers in the Kolar gold mines. Despite Sholingur, 
Srirangapatna, Wayanad and Koregaon, the Dalits were classified as non-martial by 
the British, thereby blocking their social mobility, something that was possible in an 
earlier era without enumerators and census. Finally, it was Gandhi who chose 
Ambedkar to head the drafting committee of the Constitution.
It is indeed an irony that after helping Raja Sekhar Vundru, the Ambedkarite 
scholar and bureaucrat, stop Roland Joffe in 2003 from making a Braveheart-like 
Hollywood movie on the battle of Wadagaon (which the Peshwa won against the 
British), I write this piece on Koregaon now. Wadagaon or Koregaon, it is foolish to 
valorise either the feudal Peshwa or the colonial British. They were oppressive rul-
ers and their soldiers were merely mercenaries.

DRY HOUSE
As a beer-glugging tribe, many 
journos are wondering about the 
“dry” Press Club they finally got 
in Srinagar when CM Mehbooba 
Mufti handed over keys of a 
colonial- era building to a repre-
sentative body of journalists. For 
the past two decades, reporters 
in the Valley had been seeking a 
space for a Press Club Kashmir, but 
the government and bureaucrats 
never showed any interest, fearing 
it would become another power 
centre. Even some journalists did 
not like the idea. In 2015, then 
CM Mufti Mohammed Sayeed 
held a meeting with journalists in 
which they reiterated the demand. 
To provoke them, Sayeed asked 
who among them drank. They 
murmured something, with none 
owning up to drinking. So welcome 
to bar-less Press Club of Srinagar! 
ADVISORS GALORE
Since Ashwani Lohani took 
over as Chairman, Rail way 
Board last August, he has been 
bombarded with advice from 
mainly retired railway officials, 
on how to run trains better. As 
he had been busy getting Air 
India on course, perhaps they 
thought he was out of touch. 
Lohani tried to ward them off—
polit ely, say sources, though 
the persistent ones refused to 
take a hint. Finally, Lohani 
posted this on Facebook: “I am 
amazed at the number of 
ex-seniors who are bubbling 
with ideas on how to set the 
railways right. Equally amazing 
is why they did not implement 
the very same ideas when they 
sat on powerful chairs.” Ouch!   
OVERHEARD Some BJP leaders are secretly rejoicing over PILs filed by Tehseen Poonawalla and 
Bombay Lawyers’ Association for a Supreme Court-monitored probe into Justice B.H. Loya’s death.
COUNTING ON STALIN
Will the EPS government sur-
vive the budget session of the 
TN Assembly? If the high court 
upholds the Speaker’s act of 
disqualifying 18 pro-TTV 
MLAs, EPS and OPS would 
enjoy a comfortable maj ority 
in a shrunken house; else, EPS 
would find his boat rocked by 
more rebels from his ranks. 
TTV would want to force a 
mid-term poll, but DMK leader 
Stalin is not confident yet —not 
since the RK Nagar debacle 
and Rajinikanth’s arrival on the 
scene. And unless the DMK 
coo perates, a no-confidence 
mot ion against the government 
is bound to fail. So EPS is 
counting on Stalin’s wavering 
mind to save his government.

BANGALORE H.N. Ramakrishna: 
This is my answer to the question you 
raise on your cover (Is God Harmful to 
Human Beings? Jan 8): If one were to 
go by all the wars driven by religious 
motivations and the number of people 
killed in these wars, which far outnum-
ber all other wars put together, then 
God certainly seems to have been 
harmful to human beings.
MUSCAT P A Jacob: “Is God harmful 
to human beings”? To answer in the 
 affirmative publicly would still be con-
sidered impolite, indeed blasphemous. 
But, history would tell you of the end-
less amount of violence and terror that 
has been unleashed in the name of the 
creator. While many articles in this 
issue try to defend the ‘essence’ of God, 
the deficit of a critical approach on God 
and religion is felt.
THRISSUR K. Aravindakshan: 
There is a part of man’s being that is 
 exhorting him to struggle for peace. He 
is at peace when he sees the sunset, 
 observes a flowing river, a canopy of 
stars or a beautiful flower, or when he 
stands on the peak of a mountain, in a 
vast desert or on the shore of an ocean. 
I do not know why, despite having 
these experiences, man is running 
after gods and religion. In ancient 
times, prophets of all hues had 
glimpses of this peace. But their fol-
lowers misunderstood them, manufac-
tured innumerable gods and through 
them religions, in order to wield tem-
poral power and ultimately to sate 
their  unending greed. They failed to 
com prehend the true intentions of 
these great souls. All  power seekers 
will plunder nature, and to this end 
they will enlist the support of any god, 
religion or ism. And the common man 
for his part will endorse these as he 
seeks to satisfy his own greed. 
ON E-MAIL Vijai Pant: Your year-
end issue could not have been more 
pertinent. We are in times where fun-
damentalism threatens to break down 
the positive ideals we aspire for. But 
after all, it is the existence of an 
 almighty force that prevents the world 
from plunging into chaos. A belief in 
some supreme power raises questions 
of morality and righteousness, awaken-
ing conscience and providing us with 
the basic tenets of humanity. 
BHUBANESWAR M.A. Ahad: Your 
New Year gift to readers is of some value. 
It made me remember a seminar organ-
ised by the philosophy department dur-
ing my college days in which the 
prevailing argument suggested that God 
and religion were a society’s means of 
disciplining people for ensuring peace 
and harmony. For God’s sake, do not 
blame God. Let God remain good. We 
must correct ourselves and give a sincere 
ear to the god-fearing.
ON E-MAIL Kangayam R. 
Narasimhan: This here is a rare issue. 
Not often is theology discussed so pub-
licly in our times, alas. The mind that 
relentlessly pursues matter will dwell 
in a vacuum without God. This is per-
haps the reason why Voltaire said: “If 
God didn’t exist, it would be necessary 
to invent him”. It is telling that the 
world’s largest democracy and biggest 
capitalist economy, the US, has “In God 
we trust” as its official motto.
PUNE G.L. Karkal: For what purpose 
or whose purpose was God created? 
People came up with the idea as a way 
to escape life’s problems. But such bel-
ief does not solve anything in reality. 
The real question is not whether God is 
harmful, but whether people are trying 
to approach these difficulties in a 
 rational and constructive way.
DHARAMSHALA Lalit Mohan 
Sharma: While Devdutt Pattnaik’s anal-
ysis on the theme shines for its 
 audaciously original approach, His 
Holiness the Dalai Lama’s words inspire 
hope. M. J. Warsi excels in clearing 
common cobwebs which entertain men 
like Mill and Tocqueville as offering the 
gospel of liberalism. I must make men-
tion of Shiv Visvanathan’s engagement 
with the contemporary as a very signifi-
cant analysis. No doubt, world leaders 
must make a push for their peoples to 
wake up from a stupor of indifference.
VARANASI Indu S. Dube: The ques-
tion whether God is harmful has been 
addressed by most pundits and reli-
gious figures in Outlook’s year-end spe-
cial issue. Most have reckoned with it 
according to their faith and learning. 
Truth is, religions and their gods are 
the well-meaning work of prophets and 
their early followers, who prescribed 
sets of rules and codes of conduct for 
letters

people to follow. The question of God’s 
existence has fascinated mankind since 
ancient times. Preachers and saints 
have pored over this question for long; 
in the process some have been turned 
into gods themselves. So it goes.
Godly Reflections
MUSCAT Ramachandran Nair: The 
first article in the package by the Dalai 
Lama (Inner Peace Vital, Jan 8) set the 
tone for the rest. I must agree that any 
violence in the name of God is certainly 
against the wish of God. Truly, humans 
cannot represent God properly; it 
 always leads to factionalism. In India, 
home to so many spiritual icons, none 
can stem the tide of religious and com-
munal hatred. All the powerful citadels 
of popular godmen have started reek-
ing of arrogance. The disappointing 
thing is to see these living gods living in 
luxury at the expense of their blind 
devotees. Why? They should come out 
of their cocoon, like the Buddha, and 
see how people  actually live.
Culture Sheet Check
TORONTO Varun Shekhar: While 
Upinder Singh’s article on the role of 
violence and religion in ancient India 
was a good read for neophytes (The 
Warlike Bodhisattvas, Jan 8), I didn’t 
like the lecturing tone of the piece. 
Everyone knows that not every Hindu, 
Buddhist or Jain in the last thousand 
years was a pacifist saint. But when you 
look at the overall record of Indian cul-
ture, it is quite good on the matter of 
inter-faith relations and acceptance of 
diverse doctrines.
God Save the Man
GOA M.N. Bhartiya: This refers to your 
editorial comment The Good God (Jan 
8). People’s ignorance is their God; the 
greater the ignorance, the larger God 
looms on their canvas. Those who 
 believe the universe is orchestrated by a 
power beyond their comprehension see 
God as a mysteriously omnipotent and 
omnipresent force, but keep it a secret 
as their affair with God is private and 
 sacred. The public manifestation of God 
through several religions is only for 
grooming the dominated sections of 
 society and for making the oppressed 
sections accept their exploitation under 
a cover of holiness and spirituality. No 
wonder most people are gullible and 
 remain mesmerised enough to happily 
suffer all the injustice heaped on them 
by the grossly  unjust social order. 
Power-crazy politicians encourage sup-
remacy competitions among different 
gods and their followers, divided into 
several religions and castes, pitting 
them against each other. May God save 
us from this opium of the masses!
PALAKKAD Col (Retd.) C.V. 
Venugopalan: The answer to your 
cover question in bold is yes. Bomb 
 attacks, mass murders, wars or even 
 individuals trying to drive cars into 
crowds, all are being done in the name 
of a loving, caring, merciful, father, 
mother, son or formless god”. This con-
cept   of God in the “collective ego” of 
tribes, nations, and religions always 
contains a strong element of paranoia:  
“us against the evil others “  This 
 extreme collective paranoia is the main 
Being and Essence
LUCKNOW M.C. Joshi: Refer to Man’s 
Ego is a Horse Without Reins. The answer to 
that age-old question, ‘What is God?’, has 
been given by Mata Amrit anandamayi: “God 
is not an individual, a personality or a par-
ticular form that sits on a golden throne bey-
ond the sky and passes judgment. God is 
pure consciousness.” Common believers are 
god-fearing, contented and satisfied with 
their own gods. For the poor, God is an invisible but omnipresent force 
which controls the universe and would provide them succour.  It instils con-
fidence in them and consoles them in grief. Those committing mindless 
murders in His name are not believers but betrayers of God and religion.

cause of much human suffering:  the

tics and witches , gau rakshaks’ killings

mentalist killings in the Middle East. 
All these have come out of the ‘my God

said, “God is dead”. Not quite. There  
are frenzied attempts at killing gods 
everywhere. But the atma in me  prom-
ises that the good God will survive.
ON E-MAIL Anu Bangara D’Souza: 
Kudos to your ‘God‘ edition. As a Hindu 
married to a Christian, I couldn’t agree 
more with the editorial. My husband 
and I do not subscribe to the idea of 
conversion under any circumstance. 
Religion should be a personal matter, 
and no authority should be allowed to 
interfere with it. I look forward to more 
such cover stories.
ON E-MAIL Jean Rogers: Isn’t the 
very notion believers hold—that their 
God/religion is better than another’s, 
the reason they follow that particular 
religion? Think about it, if you force 
everyone to say that every religion is as 
good as theirs, the religions are them-
selves bound to lose their value.
CHENNAI Akash Verma: “Well, all I 
know is that the poorer one is and the 
more unpredictable one’s life is, the 
more real God becomes and greater the 
need of a God, any God,” reads a line in 
your Comment. In case you haven’t 
checked, it so happens that most of the 
temples, mosques, churches and syna-
gogues run not because of the prayers 
of the poor but because of the contribu-
tions from the rich.
Scars of History 
ON E-MAIL Nasar Ahmed: I reckon 
that the writer of your story on caste 
riots in Tamil Nadu (Sectarian Fire 
Burns, Jan 8) is most likely a Brahmin 
with an RSS bent of mind. Why else 
would he try to portray fights among 
different sects of Hindus as well as 
those among Hindus, on one side, and 
Muslims or Christians, on the other, as 
authentic, but the ones instigated by 
Brahmins as frivolous. He also claims 
an RSS office was bombed by Muslims, 
even though the Supreme Court rel-
eased all the accused in that case for 
lack of evidence. Repeating a lie until it 
 becomes the truth is, after all, the RSS 
method of truth-telling.
ON E-MAIL Ratana Sifu: The writer 
says, “ That even the Jain sources do 
not speak about the event or that the 
Jains were thriving long after the sup-
posed mass impalements do not seem 
to deter them.” Well, Jain monks, just 
as Buddhist monks, are not allowed to 
point fingers, or go to court. That’s the 
reason why they remain silent.
Spiked Cocktail
OLDENBURG (GERMANY) Veena 
Talwar: Rakshanda Jalil’s piece (‘Oh, 
But You Don’t Look Like a Muslim!’, Jan 
8) explains many misgivings, stereotyp-
ing and idiocies that plague perceptions 
about Muslims in India since Partition. 
That historic event seems to have kept 
alive the stark division of our society 
into two communities, and recent 
events have exacerbated these percep-
tions. I grew up in Lucknow, hence I cel-
ebrate our Ganga-Jamuna culture in the 
cocktail that was India. I hope the sec-
tarian poison that seems to have been 
mixed into it by political and fundamen-
talist forces will lose its potency as the 
more powerful elements of mutual love 
and recognition dominate once more.
CALCUTTA Lt Col Ranjit Sinha 
(retd): Rakshanda Jalil’s experiences 
are raw and heartfelt. I was brought up 
in a remote Bengal village where the 
majority were Muslims; some of them 
looked after our farmland. There were 
Maulvis also. Life was full of compassion 
and understanding. Ever since the com-
munal politicisation of the land, such 
fellow feeling has disappeared. We need 
a civil society movement to fight this evil 
before it destroys the country.
Nectar for Thought
ON E-MAIL Akanksha Jain: This is in 
reference to Man’s Ego is a Horse 
Without Reins, your interview with Mata 
Amritanandamayi. Meeting Amma and 
keeping in touch with her has been the 
most wonderful experience of my life. I 
have been with her for 17 years, and yet I 
am filled with surprise every time I see 
her. It is amazing that she can constantly 
interact with so many people without 
tiring. Showering love and compassion, 
she greets the last person with as much 
zeal and enthusiasm as she showed the 
first, without sparing a thought for her 
own hunger or need to rest, and never 
losing her patience. She is my guru and 
my God. If you were not with me, Amma, 
I would not have survived and travelled 
so far. You have given meaning to my life 
and I have no words with which to thank 
you. I know, I am merely one among a 
million children of Amma who have had 
such an experience.
ON E-MAIL Nathan Garnett: Your  
interview emphasised the importance of 
spiritual culture in contemporary times. 
I appreciated both the inquisitive ques-
tions and the thoughtful answers that 
can be actualised in our daily lives. It’s 
inspiring and encouraging to have 
teachers such as Amma around us.
DELHI N. Kunju: Your question- 
answer session with Amritanandamayi 
was so philosophical that it’s impossible 
to believe it could come from an unedu-
cated person, howsoever a genius she 
might be. As it is, you have not given the 
name of the  interviewer, though credit 
is given to the photographs. I wonder if 
the Amma would be able to answer the 
questions if she were examined in a 
class  room-like environment.
 
TORONTO Rick: Amma tells us “the 
path to God is only meant for people 
with tremendous mental strength”. 
Not quite right! I would be the first to 
argue that reason is vital to faith. But I 
would never make a statement like the 
above. Some aren’t smart enough to 
know, and therefore belong to, God? I 
don’t think so. God’s love is agape 
(which is Greek), which is love based on 
reason. God doesn’t disapprove of 
other forms of love, but the  important 
aspect of his love, which we should try 
and imitate, is reason.

patronage, and “Tunday Kababi” bec-
ame an iconic brand. Rece ntly, this 
name has been the object of a legal 
tussle between Tunday’s grandson 
Mohammad Usman and one Moham-
mad Muslim, who claims to be an 
illegitimate female-line gra n dson of 
Tunday. The issue came to Usman’s 
attention when he discovered that 
Muslim had licensed someone to 
open a restaurant called “Lucknow 
Wale Tunday Kababi” in Delhi. 
Proceedings began in 2014; Delhi 
HC decided in favour of Usman last 
month, stating that Muslim had filed 
no evidence in support of his claims.

his parents as well as funds donated 
by neighbours, with the final cost 
coming to Rs 1.5 lakh. While he was 
working on it, he heard the mayor 
mention the idea of using drones to 
combat dengue, and decided to offer 
his services. Test flights of the drone, 
which Ghosh says can rise to 1,800m 
but will be restricted to 200m for 
security purposes, will begin soon.

USPECTED 26/11 Mumbai terror attack mastermind 
and head of the banned Jamaat ud­Dawa, Hafeez 
Saeed, is yet again under the scanner. This time, a BBC 
report accuses of him of inciting British youth to jehad 
during a tour of the UK in the 1990s.
A Dawn report citing the BBC investigation says, Saeed, 
who has a $10 million bounty on his head for allegedly 
masterminding 26/11, thrilled audiences in packed mosques 
in cities around the UK by calling for a return to the days 
when Muslims waged jehad and infidels paid them protection 
money. Saeed, founder of Lashkar­e­Toiba (LeT), a terror 
group active in Kashmir, has always denied involvement in 
the Mumbai carnage. The BBC investigative report came 
amidst concerns for the British government and intelli­
gence agencies about the large number of Muslims going 
abroad to fight in Iraq, Somalia, Libya and Syria.
The investigation, which was 
the basis of a 40­minute BBC 
Radio 4 documentary, The Dawn 
of British Jihad, was broadcast 
on Tuesday night. It revealed 
that the roots of violent religious 
struggle by British Muslims were 
laid in the mid­1990s, much earl­
ier than previously thought.
The tour of Britain was 
chronicled in Mujalla Al Dawah, 
a monthly magazine published 
by Saeed’s organisation, Markaz 
Dawa Wal Irshad.
According to the articles, unc­
overed during the BBC investigation, Hafiz Saeed arrived in 
Britain on Aug 9, 1995, and set about lecturing the youth 
about jehad. Summing up the British tour, the author 
wrote: “A large number of young people want to get jehad 
training. A group of around 50 college and varsity students 
has so far finalised its programme. The valleys of Britain 
are resounding with chants of jehad. The time is not far 
off when Muslims will wake up”, and the era of the early 
Muslim invaders of Europe “will come back in the vales of 
Europe. There will be chants of Allahu Akbar over Alhamra 
if the spirit of jehad is back among Muslims of Europe.”
Each trip raised £1,50,000 or more, and women donated 
their gold bangles and earrings in response to Saeed’s call. 
Hundreds of Britons went to battlefields in the Philippines, 
Kashmir and Bosnia, with some losing their lives.
Britain banned LeT in early 2001 and Pakistan a year  
later. But shortly before that, Saeed resigned and formed 
JuD, which is currently on a watchlist, though officially not 
banned. Saeed was confined to his home in Pakistan for 
several months last year, but has been freed since.

The BBC Radio 
4 docu shows 
the fateful  
effect a  
jehad - spouting 
Saeed had on 
British 
Muslims. Many

call and

“Currently, the predominant business model for 
 commercial search engines is advertising. The goals of 
the advertising business model do not always 
 correspond to providing quality search to users.”
oogle co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page 
wrote those words—evergreen and prescient—20 
years ago and 12,383 km away. People today could 
find it a tad ironic that the words were not merely 
courier-delivered by the two, but actually 
authored by them —the quote is from their 
Stanford paper, The Anatomy of a Large-Scale 
Hypertextual Web Search Engine, which dates 
back to the same year that the search engine 
came into being. So, do truths change? Maybe. 
Why they called it ‘Google’ and not the now-odd-
sounding ‘BackRub’ was because “googol, or 10^100, 
…fits well with our goal of building very large-scale 
search engines.” Google became the gateway drug to 
the larger fix that was the internet, or even what 
Maggi was to noodles, but it was primarily a search 
engine. Not anymore.
If the World Wide Web is indeed a gossamer mesh 
spun by many over time, Google is now the largest

of data flow where. Almost every other form of normal on-
line activity seems to happen through it, as if it were the 
ether itself. Or a looming omnipresence/omniscience. But, 
in a way, it too is being watched now. Or rather, searched—
its giant, mutating form is eliciting more than a little inter-
est for the way it dominates and controls the landscape, 
without itself being subject to any reciprocal commitment. 
Since no one can escape its all-pervasive nat ure, others are 
beginning to resent the way it itself eludes an externally set 
responsibility while exerting huge power.
In one way, it’s the old world trying to catch up with the new. 
Look at taxation. It’s a shadow that hounds most of the digital 
economy globally—it’s following Google around too. As per-
haps it should. Consider this: Google’s India revenue was 
Rs 7,208.9 crore in 2017, up from Rs 5,904 crore the previous 
year, and it pays minuscule taxes on that. Then there’s the 
matter of anti-trust legislation it has got entangled into of 
late—the way Microsoft did in the 1990s. As an operating sys-
tem, that was as inescapable; Google eludes your veto by being 
an omnibus that surrounds you from within and without.
I
T’S been an amazing outward expansion along all axes 
that brought it here. The once-pristine search engine 
with that iconic uncluttered white screen first became 
everyone’s  default e-mail service, then a browser, a library 
of every book that was ever written, an archive of every 
website you’ve been to, every photo you’ve clicked, then 
your phone’s OS, your GPS-enabled map, your YouTube, 
your newspaper boy who will deliver your news, then make 
a  permanent mental noting of what you read…. In short, 
you’ve been well and truly Googled.
 But what’s intriguing is how the modalities of news have 
changed with Google. And, concomitantly, the rules of adver-
tising. According to market research company Statista, 94 per 
cent of India’s desktop search traffic goes to Google. And 
Google’s Android OS (with its in-built Google Chrome 
browser) runs nearly 80 per cent of India’s mobiles. So it’s not 
just about Google News as a curation platform. It’s through 
Google search that every headline, each piece of news, every 
offering of media houses, swims into people’s consciousness.
Google for ‘Narendra Modi’, and the top three links that pop 
up are news items. A couple of years ago, the first result would 
probably have been the Wikipedia link. 
Google has been ringing in the changes, 
subtly. These vast powers of dissemina-
tion also mean more than the clichéd 
 lion’s share of the digital advertising pie—
in fact, it decides how to slice and dis-
tribute the pie. Once you are taken to 
that piece of news, what ads pop up on 
the media site are governed by Google’s 
alg orithms. More vexing for media firms, 
even the rates for those ads are decided 
by Google’s own analytics. So, from ‘crea-

‘content’, Google has it all covered. Is it 
fair then to think of it, along with 
Facebook, as the ‘new Big Media’?
Most experts think so, but in degrees. 
“I would regard them as media compa-
nies, but I would not think of them as credible news organisa-
tions,” says Durga Raghunath, CEO-digital at The Indian 
Express. Despite being only media-tech firms that “get infor-
mation and services to users”, she sees them as the ‘new big 
media’ for two reasons: “Firstly, the amount of money adver-
tisers are spending on them to get to an audience and, sec-
ondly, the different ways we use them in terms of social 
networks, maps, e-mail and videos.”
Look at Google’s Rs 7,208.9 crore on a comparative scale. 
BCCL, the conglomerate that owns the Times Group, 
 bel ieved to be India’s largest media 
group, with a vast array of content 
 creators in its kitty, posted a consoli-
dated revenue of Rs 9,976 crore for FY 
2016, for all its subsidiaries, according 
to a report in TheHoot.org. The Old 
Lady of Boribunder has been around 
for 180 years; and Google, still a teen-
ager, is abreast of India’s third largest 
media house, Zee, which brought in 
close to Rs 6,434 crore in 2017. HT

top of the news market by playing the same old game. 
Traditional media applies an editorial mind: it creates ent-
ertainment, gathers news,  selects, edits, curates, does due 
diligence, and adopts a stance towards the reality it reports 
on. It also spends on news  gathering, not to mention print-
ing, production and distri bution. Google, on the other hand, 
pulls out links and tells the user what the most popular 
story is, seemingly value- neutral on all other counts.
Experts reckon that if the media is where people discover 
content, then Google and Facebook are media by that defi-
nition. In 2017, the Reuters Digital News Report said over 
half the readers across the world came across a story not 
due to an editor, but courtesy an algorithm. “Google is a 
giant aggregator, working with advanced technology beyond 
the reach of most media companies,” says Sebabrata 
Banerjee, a blogger who works with a leading newspaper. 
And Shamnad Basheer, founder of SpicyIP and managing 
trustee at IDIA (Increasing Diversity by Increasing Access 
to Legal Education), says: “They are big media, frighten-
ingly so…big media that has largely escaped regulation.”
Sevanti Ninan, editor of TheHoot.org, a media watchdog 
(which has been funded by Google as Outlook reported in 
2013), off ers a more nuanced view. “Google helps content find 
users int erested in it,” and that’s a “huge blessing for niche 
media”, she feels. “It drives traffic, is a disseminator, and that 
makes it neither publisher nor platform. YouTube is a plat-
form, and inc reasingly a really important one, which 
allows you to start a channel on it, making it a publisher 
of video content.”
Fish or fowl? Hardly matters. Categories blur, even as you 
define them. YouTube, for instance, plans to launch its own 
programming with subscription platforms, like Netflix and 
Amazon Prime. What matters is that a list of 2017’s top 30 
global media brands by Zenith placed Alphabet Inc, which 
became Google’s parent company in 2016, on top. Facebook 
came in second. Together, the report said, Google and 
Facebook accounted for 64 per cent of the growth in global 
advertising between 2012 and 2016—and that’s where the 
shoe is beginning to pinch.
Since aggregators are parasitic on everyone else, publishers, 
the actual content creators, were relying on pieces of this pie 
being passed around. But trickledown can be an illusory 
thing—in India as much as in the West. The Washington Post 
reported late last year that Buzzfeed and Vice were going to 
miss their 2017 revenue projections. In a recent article detail-
ing their financials for the past five years, Buzzfeed founder 
Jonah Peretti admitted they couldn’t rely on the aggregators 
for revenue: “Google and Facebook are taking the vast maj-
ority of ad revenue, and paying content creators far too little 
for the value they deliver to users.”
Tempers are frayed, and the next showdown is coming 
soon. In February, Chrome will start blocking advertise-
ments it deems “intrusive” on web pages. Since Chrome was

browser use in India by December 2017 (StatCounter data), 
its self-arrogated power to block ads on media pages acc-
essed through Google (and hence regulated by Google Ads) 
has not left publishers overjoyed. In an article in The Times 
of India, Gautam Sinha, CEO of Times Internet Limited, 
was quoted saying: “Google is effectively regulating the ent-
ire digital ad industry, including its competitors—a role no 
company should have the authority to do.”
In an e-mail response to Outlook, Anant Goenka, execu-
tive director of The Indian Express, says premium publish-
ers stopped using intrusive ad formats long ago, but since 
most smartphones come “pre-installed with Chrome, 
Google must be less dictatorial in its decision-making”. He 
says that after publishing firm Axel Springer and many 
European news  organisations complained, EU regulators 
were “quick to rap Google’s knuckles for precisely such beh-
aviour. I would hate to see Google’s relationship with Indian 
publishers go down a similar path it has in Europe.”
Experts too feel Google may have overstepped, especially 
since, as Raghunath points out, Google will have an “even 
larger share of the ad pie” given Chrome’s marketshare. And 
besides being “regulated on the media side”, says Basheer, 
“Google and other big media must be continuously moni-
tored by the Competition Commission for anti-competitive 
effects…they’ve become too big.” Being 
dominant is fine, but they shouldn’t be 
permitted to “abuse this dominance”, 
he adds. Raghunath concedes that a 
better user experience is “something 
we all want”, but says Google deciding 
on your ads won’t be “an easy pill to 
swallow…for publishers who have 
 annual commitments from different 
kinds of advertisers”.
“India needs its own search engine,” 
dec lares S. Gurumurthy, co-convenor of 
the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, the RSS’s 
economic wing. A “dictatorial” China 
used “censorship to contain Google. We 
have to use anti-competition law like the 
EU,” he says, pointing out that Google 
“frames itself as just another technical 
company, which helps it sidestep scrutiny”.
Besides the immense power that all ows it such control, 
there’s raw money at stake. Alphabet Inc may have diverse 
revenue streams like the PlayStore, Apps, its cloud platform 
and Google Fiber (its optical fibre broadband service). 
However, for years, the bulk of its revenue has come cour-
tesy its proprietory advertising service, AdWords. In 2016, it 
totted up some 88.7 per cent of $89.5 billion. And Q3 in 2017 
saw it at 87.6 per cent—$24 billion out 
of $27.5 billion—so it’s a stable ratio.
With AdWords, we enter deep, eerie 
waters. It’s Google’s digital ad service 
that allows ads to be strategically cho-
sen for you, based on cookies generated 
from your browser and on keywords 
 determined by the advertisers, and then 
place them on web pages you visit. 
Google has got you covered wall to 
wall—via mail, location history, web 
act ivity, what not—so it pretty much 
knows what you’re a sucker for. This 
 enriched,  micro-detailed customer pro-
file is an  illicit goldmine for advertisers. 
Google gets paid when there’s ‘action’ 
(clicks) on these ads.

falling by minuscule amounts since 2008, but Google still 
takes home a mammoth 32.8 per cent of a global digital ad 
 industry worth around $200 billion. How does India stack up? 
The market size was brushing Rs 10,000 crore by December 
2017, a joint survey by ASSOCHAM and KPMG found. And 
the stakes are growing fast.
So, how much do Indian brands have to spend via Google to 
be seen? Outlook accessed plans charted out for a well-known 
clothing brand and the Indian arm of a global infotainment 
channel. Over four weeks, the former intends to spend over 
Rs 7.5 lakh targeting keywords in Google searches to show 
image advertisements. Another Rs 2.5 lakh is set aside for 
Google Display Network. YouTube is a prime target, where it 
may choose to spend Rs 20 lakh alone on InStream and 
InDisplay ads for the first week and Rs 10 lakh on InStream 
ads over the month. (InStream are the six-seconds-before-
you-skip ads, which run before a video plays, while InDisplay 
displays content on YouTube and GDN.) The channel, on the 
other hand, has a four-phase plan worth Rs 20 lakh, aiming to 
reach out to over four crore people over 10 weeks: Rs 12 lakh 
for YouTube, Rs 2.5 lakh for GDN, just over Rs 3 lakh for 
Facebook and a measly Rs 50,000 for Twitter.
Such spending plans are framed by digital marketers hired 
by brands, and these worthies are currently making a beeline 
for YouTube, in effect Google, to home in on the right eyeballs 
with the magic of algorithms, targeted keywords and search 
strings. All this, of course, without speaking of the primary 
banner ad on YouTube, which movers from within the digital 
marketing industry say goes for anything between Rs 10-20 
lakh for a day, and is sold out within days for the entire year. 
An ad banner on Marine Drive, by comparison, would cost 
Rs 3-4 crore a month to rent, says an adman: “This is digital 
real estate; it goes for the same amount in probably 10 days, 
but reaches out to so many more people.”
No wonder its charm is growing. “YouTube is the third larg-
est channel based on adspend now, after Star Plus and Zee,” 
says a digital marketing expert, who reckons it tots up some 
Rs 700-1,000 crore in a year. It’s ruthlessly perfor-
mance-linked. The likes of Star and Zee have a “streamlined 
structure with content creators getting their due”, while 
YouTube has a “very unstructured way to pay out content cre-
ators. You only get money when you go viral.”
Another insider bemoans the competition in the sector that 
has led to advertisers having to bid higher for the same key-
words. “Google enjoys a monopoly, hence it has increased the 
cost of keywords. When I started out, a click used to cost me 
Rs 17-18. Now, it’s Rs 100 for the same keyword. That’s over 
five times in four years because the competition in that seg-
ment, on that keyword, has ramped up that much. Advertisers 
are affected because the margin goes for a toss.”
The monopoly helps Google in other ways, especially when 
it decides to become a player in a segment, because it’s placed 
in a singularly advantageous place to skewer the competition! 
In June 2017, after a seven-year probe, Google was handed a 
penalty of $2.8 billion by the EU for a breach of anti-trust 
rules that related to search results for shopping comparisons. 
Why? Because Google had “systematically given prominent 
placement to its own comparison shopping service”. The EU 
noted that its “rival comparison shopping services are subject 
to Google’s generic search  algorithms, including demotion” 
and, as a result, “consumers very rarely see rival comparison 
shopping services in Google’s search results”.
The case began after the founders of Foundem, a price com-
parison website from Bracknell parish in the UK, accused 
Google of favouring its own links in searches. In 2006, 
Shivaun and Adam Raff found that their vertical search 
 engine, Foundem, was wiped off Google. After repeated 
 requests, Foundem, which won The Gadget Show’s award for

best price comparison website in 2008, was restored in 2009—
only to be barely discoverable on Google (as opposed to 
searches on Yahoo and Bing).
“In October 2009, we defined search neutrality as the princi-
ple that search engine results should be driven by the pursuit 
of relevance and not skewed for commercial gain,” Shivaun 
told Outlook over e-mail. Two different search algorithms are 
not expected to produce similar results, “nor should they”, 
says Shivaun, but Google’s “universal search mechanism, 
which systematically promotes Google’s own services, and its 
increasingly heavy-handed penalty algorithms, which system-
atically demote or exclude Google’s rivals, are both clear 
 examples of financially motivated discrimination”.
The nearly decade-long tussle wasn’t easy. “In the end, 
getting to this point required numerous formal submis-
sions, White papers, panel discussions, op-eds, open let-
ters, as well as countless meetings with regulators, 
politicians, and journalists across four continents,” says 
Shivaun. On why she thinks this was a ‘landmark verdict’, 
she says, “It is no stretch to say the outcome of this case 
could safeguard the future of competition, innovation and 
consumer choice on the Internet.”
In August 2015, IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told the 
Lok Sabha in a written reply that the Competition Comm-
ission had directed an investigation into four separate cases 
involving alleged abuse of market dominance by Google. The 
first, filed in 2012, involved M/s Consim Info (which owns 
Bharat Matrimony) and consumer group CUTS. Accusations 
similar to the Foundem case were levelled, with the parties 
alleging that “Google runs its core business of online search 
and search advertising in a discriminatory manner, causing 
harm to advertisers and indirectly to consumers”. Google 
was “creating an uneven playing field by favouring its own 
services and of its vertical partners by manipulating the 
search algorithms,” the complaint said.
Pradeep Mehta, secretary general of CUTS, who admires 
Google for the “fantastic” services it provides, says the investi-
gation took time and Google delayed matters too—in March

2014, the Competition Commission penalised it to the tune of 
Rs 1 crore for not cooperating in the investigations. Sources 
say a Competition Commission order is now expected in 
weeks and it may have repercussions for Google. It would be 
the classic instance of an older legal framework evolving to 
catch up with the ways of a fast-mutating digital world.
Taxation is another area many countries are breaking their 
heads over. On October 25, 2017, the Bangalore bench of the 
I-T appellate tribunal asked Google to pay taxes on Rs 1,457 
crore remitted to Google Ireland between 2007-08 and 2012-
13, citing what seemed to be a “clear design to skip the liability 
by both the assessee as well as GIL (Google Ireland) by having 
mutual understanding”. The latter appealed to the Karnataka 
High Court, which asked the tribunal to dispose of the appeal 
in “an expeditious manner”, on or before this January 31. The 
tax amounts to a mere Rs 129 crore (of which Google has dep-
osited Rs 70 crore, and has been asked by the court to keep 
ano ther 20 per cent aside in a Bangalore bank account), but it 
would set a precedent that can be safely called momentous.
The question relates to the definition of what’s known in 
business as a ‘permanent establishment’—loosely, “a fixed 
place of business in a particular jurisdiction that gives rise to 
income or value-added tax liability”. Can a digital entity like 
Google, which by definition transcends physical spaces, be 
 circumscribed by laws that related to the good old days of 
brick and mortar? Conversely, can it be allowed to cream a 
real physical territory off a few neat thousand crores, manipu-
lating the very space where local (taxable) entities operate, 
without itself being tax-liable?
Akhilesh Ranjan, principal commissioner of international 
tax, feels there should be liability, for good reasons. “They are 
able to render services without a physical presence; Google 
Ireland need not have an office in India. The issue is how do 
we tax Google. In all such cases, there is value addition based 
on market demand and customer base. Google has your data, 
user data, which has value. Since there is value addition, there 
should be a tax,” he tells Outlook. In July 2017, Google had a 
close shave in France with paying $1.3 billion worth of taxes. 
The core issues were set out in 2013 in the ‘White Paper on 
digital economy taxation’ by Pierre Collin and Nicolas Colin, 
then senior officials with the French government. In this 
 ongoing attrition, the law is the Biblical shadow, trying to keep 
up with the pace of the digital revolution.
I
N India, one big bone of contention pertained to AdWords, 
the major source of Google’s profits. In its order, the 
Bangalore bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal 
(ITAT) said, “We are unable to persuade ourselves to 
agree with the reasoning for treating the payment made by 
the advertisers (to Google) as a business profit and not as a 
royalty.” Why would ‘business profit’ sound more harmless 
for Google than ‘royalty’? One, because India’s double tax-
ation treaty with Ireland protects anything Google Ireland 
may show on its books, even if it is passed on by Google 
India. Royalty, on the other hand, carries a more loaded 
meaning. It rests on the assumption that Google India 
is using a patented technology and intellectual property 
(AdWord) technically owned by Google Ireland and hence 
any profit Google India makes using that technology and 
remits to Google Ireland is seen by Indian authorities as 
royalty—and hence taxable. Google prefers to see it as 
Edited excerpts from an interview with The Indian Express executive 
director Anant Goenka:
Is it fair that the likes of Google decide advertising rates even though 
they only curate ‘content’ from other publishers?
Fair or not fair isn’t the question. Google is a reality and most of 
Silicon Valley has learned and recognised it isn’t in their interest to 
kill original content creators. We have to work together to build a 
sustainable digital economy.
There are anti-competition cases against Google in India and you 
have said they are being ‘dictatorial’ in a sense.... 
They should try to take publishers on board. Facebook generally 
engages in conversation, but Google has in the past acted more 
unilaterally in terms of decisions concerning the industry.
With a chapter titled ‘Data Localisation’ in the Srikrishna Committee 
White paper on data protection, do you think it is necessary for a 
government to impose jurisdiction on digital players?
Governments or industry bodies in India need to be more active in 
the governance of the internet. Our participation in iCANN for 
 example has been pitiful. As a country that will soon emerge as 
the largest consumer of the internet as a medium, we should have 
more of a say in how the medium grows, if not internationally, at 
least domestically.
It could be argued that the internet was supposed to be a free- 
flowing information platform. Would the powers that be have more 
control over the internet?
The medium has the potential to be a democratic platform, but the 
truth is the digital world today can only be travelled on the back of 
five very large for-profit Silicon Valley-based organisations.

“distribution fee”, whereas Indian tax authorities see it fit to 
be taxed under “section 9(1)(vi) of the I-T Act read with the 
Indo-Ireland Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement”.
Experts are divided. Ranjan backs the ITAT order, saying 
Adwords allows for the customisation of ads based on data 
taken from Indian users. He too contends that intellectual 
property is being transferred, “which Google Ireland all ows”. 
Prabhu Govindan, managing partner at KSCN Cons ulting LLP, 
too says the tribunal “has provided enough facts and legal 
precedence to back its judgement. By applying the principle of 
substance over form,” he feels Google’s distribution fee should 
be seen as royalty.
Girish Vanvari, partner and head of tax at KPMG India, 
which has ties with Google, disagrees, saying the “appellate 
order has read beyond the agreement” (service agreement 
 between Google India and Google Ireland). He says the bench 
is “assuming, concluding contracts”.
Many concur with the idea that the likes of Google are differ-
ent from other MNCs that have set up shop in India. Basheer 
says the closer analogy is not a McDonalds franchisee, which 
would have made the case for royalties and consequent taxa-
tion a stronger one. “It’s better to think of Google as a real- 
estate developer who uses third party agents to attract more 
people,” he says. “Google AdWords is more like digital real est-
ate. It is digital real estate. Google India 
is using Google’s trademark (brand 
name) and other intellectual property 
only incidentally. Their main purpose is 
to actively go out and solicit customers 
who can buy the keyword space.”
India is not the only place getting 
vexed by this complicated interplay 
bet ween physical and virtual economic 
activity. In 2015, the OECD came up 
with an action plan against ‘Base 
Erosion and Profit Shifting’ (BEPS), 
tit led ‘Addressing tax challenges in dig-
ital economy’. The G20’s concern was 
that MNCs were placing profits in low-
tax jurisdictions (like Ireland). One of 
the measures suggested was an ‘equali-
sation levy’ and taxation on the basis of 
a significant digital presence. This is critically relevant 
going forward because India too faces the same predica-
ment as France and a host of other countries: Google does 
not have a ‘permanent establishment’ here despite having 
offices in Gurgaon, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, 
with “thousands of employees in the country, representing 
the various aspects of the Google business from engineering 
to operations”, says a Google spokesperson. 
Sure enough, the Finance Bill of 2016, passed in 2017, imp-
osed an equalisation levy (EL) of 6 per cent on the digital ad 
space. To avoid the double taxation imbroglio, I-T provi-
sions were amended so that the levy was independent of 
corporate tax legislation. Ranjan feels EL could be looked 
at—but only as an “interim measure”. 
Why interim? Because, ultimately, in 
this era taxation can’t be based only on 
a “physical basis”, but by quantifying a 
“significant digital presence”, he says. 
It’s a fundamental shift he calls for. 
“We would like to see a change in ‘per-
manent establishment’ in tax treaties.”
Others have variations on this. Vanvari 
reckons EL “is not going to go away…
only expand its scope”. Govindan feels 
the I-T department could “consider a 
lesser tax rate for the business income of 
foreign companies with no physical 
presence”. But for now, “something like 
EL” is a viable beginning, says Ranjan. 
The demand for it is growing in EU 
countries like Italy and France. The UK 
“China used censorship 
to control Google;  
we have to use 
 anti-competition law.”

Responses to Outlook’s queries by a Google spokesperson
On the Chrome ‘ad-blocker’: These aren’t new rules for Chrome 
but rather one way in which Google is supporting an 
 industry-wide standard adopted by publishers as part of Better 
Ads coalition. 
Currently, this standard, the Better Ads Standard, applies to 
sites in North America (US and Canada) and Europe. Also, this 
is an ad-filter and not an ad-blocker.
On the CCI investigation into Bharat Matrimony and CUTS vs 
Google: We continue to cooperate with the investigation and 
remain convinced that our products are pro-competition, pro-
user and in compliance with competition laws of India.
On the ITAT order: The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), 
after a six-year-long battle with Google India, made a tax 
dem and on Rs 1,457 crore—by holding payments made by 
Google India to Google Ireland as its reseller of the advertising 
space as royalty. We filed an appeal and the high court issued 
a stay order. 
We are encouraged by the high court’s stay, pending further 
hearings, on the Bangalore Income Tax Appellate Tribunal’s 
ruling, which we believe was a clear  departure from previous 
judgments on the issue and not in line with India’s double 
taxation avoidance agreements.
On the prospect of ‘data localisation’: We continue to work 
with the Industry to put forward our views.

B
UT how do you actually gauge ‘significant digital presence’ 
(SDP)? How to map a non-material phenomenon onto 
a physical territory? Definitions have to be sharpened, 
made precise. Should it be subscribers, or the volume of 
user data generated from the country in question? Vanvari 
reckons getting a precise fix on SDP will be crucial for other 
reasons too—given the parallel, and even more rapid, rise of 
technology like crypto-currency. That’s why he feels EL—a 
sort of bridge between the old and new—won’t go away. “The 
digital presence will always be in jurisdictions outside India. 
What you can control is payment to this source,” he says.
But the conceptual shift can no longer be evaded. “The not-
ion that somebody must be taxed based on some sort of (phys-
ical) presence needs a serious relook…people in the digital 
space are constantly busting borders,” says Basheer. Terr-
itoriality won’t work in a landscape where people don’t do 
business according to “the rigours of rigid borders”, he says. 
“You are trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. The law is 
the round hole, and Google et al in the digital space the square 
pegs. You have to change the shape of the round hole to acc-
ommodate the peg...make it more malleable, so to speak.”
The retuning won’t be simple. Govindan cautions that a sys-
tem based on SDP would be “very subjective and complex to 
administer”, increasing compliance costs for business. “Also, 
tax departments of all the countries should be willing to inte-
grate into a common I-T infrastructure,” he elaborates.
Perhaps some things don’t change, and even Google can’t 
permanently avoid taxes. Tax and competition authorities 
are on its tail, and a ‘framework’ is in the works. Last August, 
the government set up the Srikrishna Committee to look at 
the possibility of a data protection law. In the 240-plus-
page White paper that it calls “necessarily lengthy”, the 
committee may just have homed in on a “game-changer”, 
according to T. Prashant Reddy, author and assistant pro-
fessor at NALSAR, Hyderabad. 
The ninth chapter of the paper (which was open for public 
consultation until the final day of 2017) introduces the topic 
of ‘Data Localisation’—think of it as a new kind of pre-nuptial 
contract between digital and physical, as the phrase implies. 
“Data localisation requires companies to store and process 
data on servers physically located within national borders,” 
the paper says. “A nation has the prerogative to take measures 
to protect its interests and its sovereignty, but it must care-
fully evaluate the advantages and dangers of locally storing 
data before taking a firm decision on an issue (that) has the 
potential to cause a major ripple effect across a number of 
ind ustries,” it adds. That last bit obviously applies to the IT 
and telecom sectors, and the start-up ecosystem.
“The likes of Google will need to set up data farms in India, 
and that will change the rules of the game,” says Reddy, 
since the government does not really have “too much 
 jurisdiction over Google Inc” at present. After localisation, 
“for all practical purposes, they will need to operate on 
Indian soil with a physical presence. But does that give the 
government too much power over Facebook and Google?” 
Reddy asks. Searching for an epoch-defining power 
 struggle? Ask Google. O

T is probably clear to most Indian media 
companies that their nemesis is not a rival 
newspaper, TV channel or website, but 
tech’s T-Rexes. More specifically, Google and 
Facebook. The latter two call themselves 
technology companies, but they are feeding 
at the same trough that media companies do.
For some time now, tech companies have been 
eating the lunch of media companies by swiping 
a larger and larger share of advertising revenues 
that earlier accrued to the latter. With almost 
zero cost of producing content, and by simply 
sweeping headlines and web links off news sites 
and blogs, Google News attracts a lot of traffic. 
Though there are no ads on these pages, user 
searches for specific types of news allow Google 
to place appropriate ads in the right context, 
giving advertisers a better chance of finding 
pot ential customers. Google can thus skim the 
cream of ad revenues. Facebook delivers cus-
tomers who display a tendency to linger on the 
site. Unlike Google, which is an aggregator, 
Facebook is a publishing platform, but won’t 
admit it is a media company.
The upshot: an internet duopoly exists outside 
China between Google and Facebook; they were 
the top two ad income earners in 2016, with ad 
revenues of $79.4bn and $26.9bn, according to 
media data cruncher and analyst Zenith. The two 
swallow roughly one-fifth of total global ad 
spends, and this can only grow, though there are 
now at least three Chinese internet Godzillas—
Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba—also eyeing the pie. 
Nine out of every 10 dollars of growth in ad 
spends by 2020 will be driven by internet firms, 
and much of this will go to Google, Facebook and 
the Chinese trio, says another media report.
In India, Google reported revenues of Rs 7,208 
crore in the year to March 2017, which is just a 
hop-step-and-jump away from the turnover of 
India’s biggest media group, Bennett Coleman & 
Co Ltd (BCCL), which publishes The Times of 
India. BCCL and its subsidiaries should have 
crossed the Rs 10,000 crore turnover mark in the 
last financial year.
According to Zenith, India will be one of the 
few large markets where traditional media will 
see advertising growth, with TV set to see nine 
per cent growth in 2018, radio 10 per cent and 
print five per cent. But the biggest growth will be 
in internet advertising, which will grow over 20 
per cent. No prizes for guessing who will be 
grinning all the way to the bank.
The ascendance of Google and Facebook (also 
Twitter, more recently) in the media world is 
the result of a gradual shift of market power 
from individual brands and companies to tech-
nology platforms. Apart from Google, Facebook 
and the Big Three Chinese search and e- 
commerce platforms, the other tech platforms 
are Apple and Amazon.
A platform is really an ecosystem that allows

developers to benefit from the network effect of 
working together; this, in turn, makes the plat-
form even more powerful. Google was not a 
platform 20 years ago, when it was merely a zany 
search engine. Today, with mail, media, maps, 
shopping and more, it has made itself indispen-
sable to businesses that seek the customers 
hooked to the platform. Other Google products, 
like the Android operating system for smart-
phones, have become mini platforms in them-
selves, with nearly 90 per cent market share in all 
markets outside North America.
The reason why platforms are a threat to all 
traditional businesses, including the media, is 
this: when technology takes over the middle 
function, where it seamlessly brings buyers and 
sellers together on your computer or smart-
phone screen, it effectively commoditises the 
product on offer. For example, when you buy an 
air ticket on a site like Makemytrip.com or 
Cleartrip.com, the fare (apart from the flight 
time) is the most important element of com-
parison for the traveller. It’s the same when you 
compare the prices of multiple mobile phones 
on Flipkart or Amazon. The seller of products 
or services is thus a “price-taker”, and not an 
effective participant in determining the price of 
his service or his brand. The tech platform 
knows all about both demand and supply, and so 
is best placed to gain both from spikes or drops 
in demand or supply.
The European Union (EU) had in 2016 pro-
posed that Google should pay for the revenues 
it makes on content that is not its own, but thus 
far there has been no forward movement on 
this, since smaller websites fear that making 
Google pay may end up reducing their traffic. In 
India, too, it may be time for the competition 
regulator—the Competition Commission of 
India—to start looking into the growing monop-
oly of tech platforms in news vending and adv-
ertising revenues. Regulators like TRAI and the 
I&B ministry should be setting up study groups 
to suggest ways for the aggregators to share 
revenues with content producers.
Other tech platforms, including the likes of Ola 
and Uber, should be mandated to disclose infor-
mation on their share of the cut based on the 
total fares indicated to the customer. Uber and 
Ola drivers are often miffed that a big share goes 
to the platform, and not to them. Airlines, for 
their part, should be asked to periodically dis-
close the details of their dynamic pricing policies 
so the consumer is not gypped.
One hesitates to suggest ham-handed regula-
tion, which is what one might get in a country like 
India, in a dynamic business. But, equally, it seems 
obvious that platform revenue models are a black 
box. Shining the torch of transparency on pricing 
practices, whether of Google, Amazon, Uber or the 
airline companies, cannot be a bad idea. O

T was January 18, 1943. Independence was immi-
nent and Pakistan was but a mischievous slogan. 
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had been invited to address a 
gathering assembled at Pune to remember the 
101st birthday of the great jurist and nationalist, 
Mahadev Govind Ranade. The Quit India 
Movement of August 1942 had just been put down. 
Ambedkar spoke out his mind. Gandhi and Jinnah 
had made a mess of Indian politics by resorting to 
politics based on community identities, he said, 
much like the bad old days when the Peshwa pro-
moted caste and community, privileged the rich and 
powerful, while people suffered widespread misgov-
ernance that was made worse by the depredations of 
roving bands of Pindaris. Ambedkar warned his au-
dience that India needed politics that was based on 
the interests of the nation and not a narrow, specific 
community. He reminded the gathering that people 
had breathed a sigh of relief at the defeat of the 
Peshwas and their cursed rule. So bad was the rule of 
the Peshwa, Ambedkar explained, that people were 
even willing to go with the English.
That last, of course, was both an over-statement 
as well as an under-statement. It was an over-state-
ment in two ways. One, Indians never fully ap-
proved of British rule. Two, once the British settled 
down to rule they became just as casteist as Indians. 
So much so that in 1892 they even placed a ban on 
the Mahars entering the army. A ban that, 
Ambedkar would plead, needed to be removed to 
give equal opportunity for all to grow.
It was an understatement in so far as the fact was 
that Indians were willing to soldier for anyone, irr es-
pective of caste, religion or race. Soldiering, in fact, 
was an important add-on occupation in India. Every 
Indian carried a weapon and was willing to fight with 
anyone and for anyone. To join an army all that one 
needed to do was to bring one’s own personal weap-
ons and kit along with a tattoo—a pony. The pay, 
ess entially a retainer, was good. A victory could on 
occasion result in a handsome bonus in the form of a 
share in the loot. The only negative was that one 
needed to take care that one’s horse and kit were not 
damaged in such an adventure. Which meant that a 
battle, for most part, needed to be one of wits rather 
than a physical confrontation. Rajas, maharajas and 
badshahs who could demonstrate an ability to win 
with their wits were preferred as masters to those 
who required their soldiers to kill or be killed.
Military leaders, at least in the Maratha territories, 
ensured that soldiers were always kept in arrears of 
pay so that they did not leave service before the adv-
enture on which the leader had embarked was over. 
Typically, a soldier would end up getting paid only for 
ten or less months in a year, if at all that. In extreme 
cases of arrears troops would simply refuse to fight 
till past wages had been settled. Doing dharna to get 
your military pay was a time-honoured practice.
In the 18th century, a foot soldier working for an 
Ind ian raja could start at Rs 6-12 per month. Often,

these were gosains, mendicants—essentially the iti-
nerant riff-raff of pre-modern India. A soldier with a 
horse and some skill with the sword could get up to 
Rs 50 a month. With the collapse of the Mughal 
emp ire and the imploding rule of the Marathas, local 
rajas upped salaries in order to attract more soldiers 
to help them out in the free-for-all that followed. An 
infantryman in the Deccan could now hope for Rs 9 
a month. Some Arabs—exotic foreigners were appre-
ciated even then—received Rs 12. A Kotwal (police 
chief) of Poona during Peshwai rule was a ‘habshi’.
The British East India Company eagerly dipped 
into this melange of Indian society. Like all other 
rulers, including the Peshwa, they hired anyone and 
everyone who was willing to fight for them. Caste or 
religion did not matter. Like in the Peshwa’s army, 
the armies of the East India Company too had 
Mah ars, Dhangars, Kunbis, Marathas, Rajputs, 
Muslims as well as Christians and Jews as soldiers. 
The Holkars ruling at Indore were from the Dhangar 
(shepherd) community. Scindias, ruling from 
Gwalior, originated as village patils. Similarly, the 
Gaekwads based at Baroda could be anything—
Shudra, Brahmin, Vaishya or Kshatriya.
No one really cared. At a pinch, if it was needed, 
one could always hire a Brahmin to set up a good 
lineage, preferably going back to one of the great 
sages of Vedic times or the sun/moon god. Tribals, 
too, freely participated in the armies and also ruled 
large tracts of land. Shivaji’s army was made up of 
Ramoshis—essentially forest and hill dwellers 
known for their ability as thieves and dacoits.
The armies of the Company were different from 
those of the Indians in one important respect. The 
Company, by the early 19th century when it had 
red uced all Marathas to a subsidiary status, insisted 
that its soldiers be accoutred in clothes given to them 
by the Company and carry weapons issued by the 
Company. This was in line with the changes in mili-
tary organisation in contemporary Europe.
In the Deccan it had the unexpected result of 
opening up fresh opportunities in soldiering for 
those who could  not afford a personal horse, 
weapons or clothes. Little wonder that when in 
September-October 1817, Captain Staunton set 
about raising a troop of soldiers at Shirur to chase 
and reduce Pindari freebooters, he was able to 
quickly get 500 foot soldiers and 300 irregular 
horse to work for the Company’s army.
The East India Company’s army had already kicked 
out the Peshwa from Pune and occupied his house 
when the skirmish at Koregaon happened on Jan-
uary 1, 1818. The Peshwa and his troops had not yet 
realised that they had lost their empire permanently. 
Thomas Munro, the Scotsman who was assigned the 
rank of brigadier when he requested to be part of the 
war against the Pindaris, noticed that most of the 
soldiers in the Peshwa’s army were the domestic 
lab  ourers of local farmers for whom breeding horses 
for the army was an important source of revenue.

The farmer would supply horse and horseman to the 
army. After the military adventure everyone would 
go back to their main occupation, either tending the 
land or working as an artisan.
Arabs were different. They soldiered for a living. 
Enhanced viciousness was their brand value. Some 
3,000 of them accompanied the Pes hwa as he ran 
from the British. Camping on the left bank of the 
river Bhima and wondering how to get Poona back, 
the Peshwa noticed that a small troop of the Com-
pany army had just reached the village of Koregaon 
across the river. Hoping for easy game, his Arab 
horsemen eagerly launched into a frontal attack.
T
HIS was the same troop that Captain Staunton 
had raised at Shirur three months ago. It had 
been supplemented by two guns and an accom-
panying section of two dozen European soldiers 
of the Madras Army. Staunton had force-marched 
his troops through the night from Shirur. This march 
of some 60 kms was undertaken to reach Pune in 
order to supplement its defence. The pla nned halt at 
Koregaon was to rest and replenish their water sup -
ply. The Company’s soldiers at this time did not carry 
personal canteens or water supplies but were sup-
plied with water by bhishti boys carrying bladders 
made of goat skin. Getting water from the Bhima, 
though, was impossible. The boys espied the Pes-
hwa’s camp on the other side, dominating the river. 
The rest of the troop had just enough time to hide 
themselves before an attack started. The two guns 
were hastily placed for use. One of them was quickly 
lost to the attacking Arabs. The temple where the 
Company soldiers took position was soon lost, as was 
the neighbouring dharamshala. One of the lieuten-
ants commanding a gun was beheaded by the Arabs. 
As the soldiers began to lose heart, Staunton showed 
them the headless body of the lieutenant and warned 
that this would be their fate too, should they fall in 
the hands of the Arabs. The warning seemed to work. 
The soldiers ignored their tiredness and thirst and 
began to defend themselves in earnest. As the day 
wore on, bodies piled up in the lanes and bylanes. By 
sundown, almost a hundred Company troops lay 
dead, another 75 were wounded. Staunton estimated 
that 600 of the Arabs had died. But there were 
enough alive to annihilate his troop, were they to 
attack again. He quickly planned a getaway. The idea 
of reaching Pune was abandoned. By the next morn-
ing he was moving back to Shirur. A week later, on 
January 8, 1818, Colonel Cunningham, commandant 
of the Auxiliary Horse at Pune, wrote to Staunton, 
congratulating him on his “escape from Koregaum”. 
Clearly, this was no victory for the English. It 
wasn’t one for the Peshwa either.
All through the day, he had observed the battle of 
Koregaon from the other side of the river, sitting on 
high ground under a sun-shade. The Peshwa had 
constantly chided the commanders of his army for 
not being able to quickly defeat a small unit of the 
Company. At nightfall, he got news of a larger body 
of Company soldiers marching in his pursuit and 
decided to move away from Koregaon.
Now, the English set up a cantonment at Kor egaon. 
Three decades later, in 1851, a victory pillar was ere-
cted here to remember, what had transmogrified 
into, “the valorous defence of Koregaon”. Each New 
Year, the army would organise a small ceremony 
here. “A march and a nautch”, as the papers rep orted 
it. It was at one such ceremony in 1927 that Ambedkar 
pointed out that apart from 30 European names 
ins cribed on the pillar, another 28 names seemed to 
be of Marathas, Rajputs, Arabs and Jews. More im-
portant for him, however, were the 22 names that 
were clearly of Mahars. For him, this underscored 
the bravery of this people who were otherwise rele-
gated to the position of a lowly dogsbody in every 
village and correspondingly declared unto uchable 
by Brahmins like the Pes hwas. “Dis e nfranchised 
from society”, as Ambedkar would put it. Yet capable 
enough to help the British defeat the Peshwa.
By now, Ambedkar had become a person of some 
consequence. A nominated Member of the Legis-
la tive Council of the Presidency of Bombay, he was 
fighting for the right of the Mahars to be given 
equal status as ‘Hindu’ in the toxic caste-riven 
soc iety of western Maharashtra. The pillar at Kore-
gaon to him became a symbol of Mahar bravery and 
upliftment. It represented the possibility of, 
Ambedkar would say, ‘enfranchising’ the Mahar. O

Like the Mahars in the Bombay army, 
Dalits (Pariahs) were part of the  
 Madras Regiment, which was more 
 secular than the Bengal Regiment, 
where upper-caste Indians resented 
fighting alongside the lower castes. 
The highest rank open to Indians 
was that of viceroy’s commissioned 
officer (a  modern JCO), and that too 
by  promotions. There was no direct 
commission. The British Indian Army 
came under direct control of the Crown 
in 1858. In 1892, Mahars were classified 
as ‘non-martial’ and proscribed from the 
viceroy’s commission along with many 
south Indian groups.

leading up to January 1,” says senior 
CPI(M) leader Ashok Dhawle, referring 
to the two top right-wingers accused of 
orchestrating violence at the Bhima 
Koregaon celebration. “When RSS hood-
lums attacked the travellers, a Dalit-
Maratha conflagration was expected. 
However, there are people who see 
through this plan on both sides and will 
oppose it.” Else, why would suddenly 
there be stone-pelting on an event that 
has been observed for years, he wonders, 
claiming the troublemakers weren’t loc-
als but were brought from outside.
Beyond the recent developments, new 
debates simmer over issues of caste con-
flict and nationalism. Different accounts 
of academics and historians—
regional and int ernational—
string up certain facts that are 
undisputed. That a battle took 
place at Bhima Koregaon on 
January 1, 1818 between the 
British troops and the Peshwa 
army, that both sides suffered 
casualties as well as injuries, 
and yet the imperialists came 
away more victorious and less 
damaged. That a pillar with 
names of slain soldiers was 
erected, that 22 of the 50 were 
Mahars, and that the ‘Vijay-
stambh’ has eventually been 
seen as an important symbol 
of their valour in the face of systemic dis-
crimination for generations.
S
OME accounts say the Peshwas 
scorned the Mahars’ offer to join 
them in the fight. Whatever, the 
pillar is about an increasing need 
for assertion of identity, according to an 
award-winning writer, who says eff orts 
to create rifts for political gains are on 
the rise of late. The recent desecration 
of tomb of Ganpat Mahar (at Vadhu 
village), who is said to have performed 
the last rites for Sambhaji (1657-89), the 
second ruler of Maratha Empire and the 
eldest son of its founder Shivaji, was a 
“deliberate attempt to stoke violence” 
between Marathas and Dalits, he adds, 
seeking anonymity. 
Historian Sachin Garud says one “can-
not ignore why all this is getting discussed 
now and who will benefit from a further 
division between Marathas and Dalits 
and other castes”. Activists point out that 
des pite an FIR being registered against 
Bhide and Ekbote, there have been no 
arrests yet, indicating RSS and BJP sup-
port to the fringe Hindu organisations.
The BJP government did announce 
compensation for the youth who died on 
January 1 and ordered a judicial inquiry 
into the clash, but it has otherwise been 
stoic in its defence. “We won’t interfere 
in the probe,” says senior BJP leader 
Madhav Bhandari. “It is not true that the 
bandh was successful. I could travel from 
Parbh ani to Pune on that day.” According 
to him, Jignesh’s provocative speeches 
alone fomented trouble.
The RPI’s Athawle, on his part, sought 
justice—albeit meekly—and that has 
further consolidated the following for 
Prakash and Jignesh. “The only clear 
message that will go out from this whole 
episode,” according to political analyst 
Kumar Ketkar, “is that the BJP cannot 
take the Dalit vote for granted, like it was 
after getting RPI in their fold.”
Historian Shraddha Kumbhojkar notes 
Koregaon has become iconic for the one-
time untouchables because it serves as a 
reminder of their ancestors’ bravery—a 
virtue the caste system claimed they 
lacked. “This may help to explain how a 
memorial to a colonial victory built in the 
early 19th century has been adapted to 
serve as a site that inspires those who 
belong to castes earlier considered unt-
ouchable,” she writes. “The valour of 
unt ouchable soldiers who fought on the 
side of the British is not perceived as a 
shameful memory today.”
Academic Neeraj Hatekar says the 
“memory” of Bhima Koregaon is “more 
about the fight for equality than the outer 
layer of British versus Peshwa.” More so, 
since history “is a collective imagination 
of events from the past.”
The complexity of inference and inter-
pretations reflects in opinions of differ-
ent experts. Anand Teltumbde, a Dalit 
academic, writes Babasaheb Ambedkar 
was “creating a pure myth” that is “req-
uired to build movements” when he 
“painted the Battle of Bhima Koregaon as 
the battle of Mahar soldiers against their 
caste oppression” in Peshwa rule. Garud 
notes an “important factor of 
caste conflict”, as the narra-
tive bears “several instances 
of atrocities by the Peshwas 
on women and Dalits, besides 
making regressive changes to 
the systems to control money 
and education.”
Shrimant Kokate, a resear-
cher on Maratha history, 
says the Peshwas did not 
allow Mahars to walk on the 
road without a pot and a 
broom tied to their bodies. 
“They were punished even if 
their shadows came in the 
way of Brahmins,” he adds. 
“The Peshwas, in their eager to control 
everything, didn’t even allow even 
Shivaji’s descendants to study.”
It is in this context that the past casts its 
long shadow on the present, which con-
tinues to witness discrimination and 
isolation of Dalits and other minorities. 
Even so, efforts are on to resist polarisa-
tion. The CPI(M)’s Dhawle informs of 
two events that took place after the riots 
and bandh. The villagers near Vadhu 
have decided to rebuild the samadhi and 
taken a call not to have fights between 
Marathas and Dalits. Second, in Auran-
gabad a sadbhavana rally was organised 
on January 8 to assert that progressive 
groups “will not buy into the RSS agenda 
of polarising on caste lines”.
Even as a Rs 10-lakh compensation has 
been declared for the deceased in the 
riots,  it’s hurting the Dalits that there is 
no move to prosecute the culprits of the 
January 1 clash. The pillar at Bhima 
Koregaon—decked up or even other-
wise—will continue to add layers to the 
region’s subaltern struggles. O
The pillar showing  
the names of the slain  
soldiers, 22 of whom 
are Mahars, is seen  
as a major symbol  
of subaltern valour.

EFORE Rahul Gandhi left for 
Bahrain on January 7, his 
house at 12 Tughlak Lane—the 
Congr ess’s new power centre—
was abuzz with activity. The 
party’s communication depart-
ment members and some office-bear-
ers were fine-tuning the strategy for 
poll-bound Karnataka. The new party 
president was insistent that they 
must learn from the Gujarat experi-
ence and strengthen booth manage-
ment. The larger message was clear: 
Karnataka must be retained at any 
cost and the BJP denied an entry into 
the south through the state.
General secretary in-charge of Karnat-
aka K.C. Venugopal was sent to the state, 
while Mallikarjun Kharge, leader of the 
Congress in the Lok Sabha, and former 
Union minister Veerappa Moily were 
asked to stay put in their respective con-
stituencies. Shashi Tharoor, who leads 
the All India Professionals’ Congress, will 
also head for the state on return from 
Bahrain, where he is accompanying 
Rahul. Communication department con-
venor Priyanka Chaturvedi, who has set 
up base in Bangalore, is learning Kannada 
and tweeting in the local language, trying 
to persuade “modern, liberal and progres-
sive” people to join her team.
“We are getting a tremendous response 
from the people,” she tells Outlook. 
“Hundreds of youngsters and profession-
als want to join us. The aim is to get more 
voices to represent an  inclusive India, 
which the Siddaramaiah government 
stands for. While countering the opposi-
tion’s (BJP) lies, we have to ensure our 
narrative is right. The brief, to revamp the 
communication and get fresh voices, has 
come from the party president.” So, as a 
tit-for-tat social media fight rages betw-
een CM Siddaramaiah and BJP’s star 
campaigner, UP CM Yogi Adityanath, 
Chaturvedi’s team comes up with 
#HoggappaYogi or “get lost Yogi”. The 
Congress, though, may find it easier said 
than done as Yogi is expected to cam-
paigning in Karnataka extensively.
Of the eight states going to polls this 
year, Karnataka is the most crucial for 
both the Congress and the BJP—perhaps 
more for the Congress as it is the only big 
state besides Punjab under its control. In 
smaller Meghalaya and Mizoram, the 
inc umbent Congress will have to fight off 
an aggressive and expansionist BJP this 
year. In the remaining poll-bound states, 
including 
Madhya 
Pradesh 
and 
Chhattisgarh, it will be a challenge to 
dislodge well-entrenched BJP govern-
ments. And, though the two rival parties 
have alternated in power in Rajasthan 
since 1993, wresting the state from the 
BJP may not be easy this time.
Clearly, it’s a tough fight ahead, but the 
Gandhi scion seems to be up for it. “Rahul 
has flagged three major tasks: ramping up 
the communication emanating from the 
party; strengthening the outreach of 
party workers down to the booth-level, 
with nearly eight lakh workers roped in to 
work in the booth committees; ironing 
out internal differences to put up a united

fight.” Rahul has also exhorted party 
leaders to attack the BJP by raising the 
issues of agrarian crisis, failure to create 
jobs and poor economic indicators.
Resolving internal differences is partic-
ularly significant in Rajasthan and Mad-
hya Pradesh, where the Congress has a 
number of CM aspirants. “This will be 
addressed sooner than later,” says a gene-
ral secretary. “RG (Rahul) does not beli-
eve in shaking things up. He likes making 
incremental changes to avoid dissidence.” 
Perhaps, that’s why he has retained the 
presidents of all the Pradesh Congress 
Committees (PCCs), with the following 
caveat: “unless some decision is taken to 
replace them”. The general secretary 
adds that some organisational changes 
may happen towards the end of the year, 
closer to when Rajasthan, Madhya 
Pradesh and Chhattisgarh go to polls.
According to a young Congress leader, 
retaining the old PCC presidents is 
Rahul’s way of showing trust in some of

PREPPING FOR THE 
BIG ONE OF 2019
Eight state polls in 2018 will 
likely set the tone for the 2019 
 general elections. While the BJP 
wants to wrest Karnataka from 
the  Congress and paint the whole 
Northeast saffron, the Congress 
will try to hold on to the little 
that’s still with it and try for more.

those whom he had personally appointed 
in 2014—for example, Arun Yadav 
(Madhya 
Pradesh), 
Sachin 
Pilot 
(Rajasthan), Bhupesh Baghel (Chha-
ttisgarh) and Ashok Tanwar (Haryana). 
Baghel’s appointment, in fact, had been 
announced in a separate statement issued 
by general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi, 
which, according to an office-bearer, 
means “Baghel is not likely to be changed 
even closer to the elections”. “RG is trying 
to create a semblance of leadership in the 
state where none exists since Amit Jogi’s 
expulsion from the party in 2016,” he says. 
Two additional working PCC presidents 
have also been appointed for Chhattisgarh.
Party leaders say the ‘working presi-
dent’ formula may be used in other 
poll-bound states too. It started from 
Gujarat, where four PCC working presi-
dents were appointed and given charge 
of Saurashtra, Kutch, Central Gujarat 
and South Gujarat, respectively. In 
Madhya Pradesh, too, the party is con-
sidering the appointment of four work-
ing presidents, one each for regions such 
as Chambal-Gwalior, Vindhya, Malwa-
Nimar and Mahakaushal. “RG feels that 
such a formula may tone down the influ-
ence of senior leaders involved in power 
struggle in states like Rajasthan and 
Madhya Pradesh,” says the young leader.
G
UNA MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, who, 
along  with Kamal Nath and Digvi-
jaya Singh, is one of the contenders 
for being the CM candidate in Mad-
hya Pradesh, downplays the leadership 
issue in the state. “We are all working 
tog ether. There’s no fight,” he tells 
Outlook. “If the Congress has to come 
back, then our individual interests have 
to be kept aside in the interest of the party. 
It is now or never for the Congress and 
people will see a different Congress this 
time. The aspirations of 7.5 
crore people of the state 
depend on us.” He is confi-
dent that BJP rule under 
Shivraj Singh Chouhan, 
which has lasted three 
terms, will end and “his 
corrupt government will 
be dealt a severe blow”. 
Scindia accuses Chouhan 
of being “anti-farmer, anti- 
women and anti-poor”.
Kamal Nath could not be contacted as 
he continues to be in his constituency in 
Chhindwara. He had earlier declared he 
is willing to fight elections under Scindia’s 
leadership. Digvijaya Singh, who has been 
CM twice, is in the middle of a six-month 
“spiritual and apolitical” ‘Narmada 
Parikrama’ and says he has no ambitions 
to be the CM candidate this time. So, 
while it seems the decks are clear for 
Scindia, sources in the party say nothing 
can be said for sure yet.
“Kamal Nath and Digvijaya Singh are not 
going to give up easily,” says a veteran 
Congress leader. “By the time of the next 
elections (2023), both will be over the hill. 
This is their only chance.” There is a sim-
ilar situation in Rajasthan. Although it 
may appear that Sachin Pilot is the natu-
ral choice as CM candidate, being the 
PCC president for the past four years, 
there is still a slip between the cup and the 
lip. “General secretary Ashok Gehlot has 
been working quietly and diligently,” says 
the veteran leader. “He has impressed 
Rahul with the way he handled Gujarat 
elections as the in-charge. He has been 
chief minister of Rajasthan 
twice and may emerge to 
be the natural choice. So 
nothing is certain yet.”
Pilot, 
however, 
had 
made his intentions clear 
when he did not contest 
the Lok Sabha by-election 
from Ajmer, a constitu-
ency he had represented 
earlier and then lost in 
2014. “He has sent the 
message that he wants to be the CM. For 
that, he will contest the assembly elec-
tion,” says the veteran leader, adding 
that Pilot has been working relentlessly 
on the ground, travelling to all districts 
and constituencies of the state.
Skirting the leadership issue, Pilot says 
that the state Congress has been in elec-
tion mode for the past four years—i.e., 
ever since he took over as PCC chief—and 
that CM Vasundhara Raje of the BJP is on 
a weak wicket. “The Congress has gained 
ground by doing remarkably well in the 
municipal elections,” says Pilot. “While in 
the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the differ-
ence between the voteshares of the BJP 
and the Congress was 26 per cent in fav-
our of BJP, it came down to just one per 
cent in the panchayat polls.”
Known for his personal touch with the 
people and party workers alike, Pilot says, 
“I have been one of the few lucky Congress 
presidents in Rajasthan who has over-
whelming support from the party and the 
people. The credit goes to all the party 
workers.” A senior Congress leader, how-
ever, points out that Pilot will need 
Gehlot’s active support in order to win. 
“These are important issues for Rahul to 
resolve—whether he will promote young 
leaders like Scindia and Pilot or go with 
the experienced ones,” he says. “Like 
what the BJP has managed to do, will 
Rahul be able to make a generational shift 
and helm a new shining Congress as he 
promised in his speech at Bahrain? How 
he handles these issues will decide how 
ready the Congress will be to take on the 
BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.” O
Retaining the 
state chiefs is 
Rahul’s way of 
showing trust 
in those he had 
 appointed in 
2014, says a 
party insider.

O
ne India, an initiative by 
Facebook on Republic 
TV, 
is 
a 
series 
that 
showcases 
stories 
on 
how 
communities 
are 
empowering themselves to solve issues by 
leveraging the strength of digital platforms. 
On the episode telecast on January 6, the 
spotlight was on Ria Sharma and her NGO 
Make Love Not Scars, founded 4 years ago.
The NGO works to provide dignity and 
independence to acid attack survivors from 
all walks of life by focusing on their complete 
medical, legal, education, vocational and 
psychological rehabilitation. They encourage 
dreaming big, fighting stereotypes and 
coming together as a community to ignite 
the hope for a promising future. They also 
conduct social media campaigns to help 
spread awareness about the cause and garner 
support for the survivors. Make Love Not 
Scars started the first online job portal for 
acid attack survivors where their abilities 
and skill sets were showcased to help drive 
employment opportunities.
On the episode, Ria was joined by a panel 
of luminaries including Dr Vikram Singh, 
Former DGP, UP Police; Ranjana Kumari, 
Academician & Social Activist; Sunitha 
Krishnan, Social Activist; Aishwarya Bhati, 
Advocate, Supreme Court; Ira Trivedi, 
Author & Influencer, and Reshma Qureshi, 
Acid Attack Survivor. 
The panel concluded that India needs more 
awareness about the plight of acid attack 
victims to ensure that displaced victims get 
adequate support for their rehabilitation. 
Changes need to be made at the judicial 
level with stricter laws for perpetrators of the 
crime, and laws already made (like the 2013 
Supreme Court ban of over the counter sale 
of acid bottles) need to be implemented more 
strictly.  Increased sensitivity in handling 
acid attack victims across society are crucial 
for their rehabilitation.

HEN the Income Tax Dep­
artment raided nine Bitcoin 
exchanges across the coun­
try on December 13, they did 
so suspecting money laun­
dering. This was far from 
una nticipated. In 2016, former Res­
earch & Analysis Wing official R.K. 
Yad av wrote a 46­page letter to PM 
Narendra Modi and Minister of Fin­
ance Arun Jaitley, alerting them to 
closed­door seminars on crypto­cur­
rencies organised by a visiting Swiss 
national in the capital and in Chennai. 
 “High-profile persons attended the 
seminar and when I found out about it, I 
wrote a cautionary note to the PM and 
the FM. The Swiss national was urging 
people to get involved with crypto-cur-
rency. It was timed in November 2016, 
right after demonetisation,” says Yadav.
Yadav also pointed out that crypto-cur-
rency was being used in money-launder-
ing and hawala to fund terrorism. In 
2014-15, investigative reporters found 
that the Eastern European mafia were 
using crypto-currency to launder their 
proceeds from running guns and drugs.
A traditional way to launder money is 
to park dirty cash (earned from crime or 
corruption) into a business. This is done 
through fake invoices generated in the 
company’s books for non-existent or 
fake transactions. That cash is then dep-
osited into the business’ bank accounts 
and declared to be income, and tax is 
paid on it, thus cleaning the dirty cash 
into “legitimately earned” income. 
In the case of  crypto-currency, one can 
convert the illicit cash into digital coins 
and pump it into a business to launder it. 
The other way is to take the converted 
digital currency, park it in accounts and 
reveal it as a capital gain on trading cry-
pto-currency through exchanges.
Doing this on networks such as Bitcoin 
and Ethereum is not possible because 
the ledger is public and the ecosystem 
survives by publicly recording every 
transaction, and therefore any illicit use 
can eventually be tracked back to the 
source. But there are crypto-currencies 
such as Monero, which guarantee com-
plete anonymity to their users and do 
not require a public key or a public 
 recording of a transaction.
In 2016, dark net traders through a post 
on Reddit.com endorsed Monero so long 
as transfers were made directly from 
buyer to seller, bypassing any exchange.
All exchanges in India offer a digital 
wallet where the crypto-currency is held 
on your behalf and all user data is held on 
servers. During the recent raids, the IT 
officials cloned the servers and hard 
drives, acquiring complete user records.
In many cases, the sleuths did not have 
to poke very far because several of the 
exchanges had implemented the Know 
Your Customer (KYC) standards man-
dated by the RBI for banks and FIs. The 
crypto-currency exchanges had obt-
ained income tax PAN cards and Aadhaar 
cards before verifying the users and let-
ting them use their services. If any users 
had cashed out their crypto-currency 
into their personal digital wallets, the 
rec ords of such transactions were with 
the exchanges. It is far from the original 
privacy-guaranteed philosophy of the 
cip her punks but was meant to safeguard 
the exchanges from any future crack-
down or impending regulation. Any enf-
orcement agency would have the legal 
writ to seek any information it req uired 
from a corporate body or firm.
Yet, there are reports aplenty of opera-
tors offering to change cash into cry pto-
currency. However, it is being done wit-
hin a closed network of people right now, 
restricted to coders and the rich. There 
have also been cases where such transac-
tions (some advertised through newspa-
pers and social media) were fraudulent. 
Delhi Police cracked down on such a 
fraud ring a few months ago.

mine your data at all times to track your 
purchases and related meta data in order 
to study and influence consumption 
habits and preferences. With anonymity, 
there is no third party peeking into how 
you spend your money. 
Coming back to Monero, you can acq-
uire this crypto-currency without rev-
ealing your information even on an exc-
hange. One can break the digital trail on 
the blockchain by buying multiple cur-
rencies. A user can buy Bitcoins directly 
but then use these to purchase Monero, 
pay for contraband and then cash out the 
remaining Bitcoin, leaving no trail lead-
ing to the money’s origin or destination.
It is still not clear where the Indian gov-
ernment stands on crypto-currency. On 
January 2, the finance minister ass erted 
that it wasn’t legal tender, also ann-
ouncing that a committee had been set 
up under the Department of Economic 
Affairs to assess crypto-currency and 
possibly set up a regulatory framework. 
The committee includes representatives 
of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Securi-
ties and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), 
the Department of Revenue and others.
The RBI has been issuing notes of cau-
tion to all trading in crypto-currency 
bec ause neither the government nor the 
central bank backs it. Sources in SEBI 
told Outlook, “at present, no regulator 
can claim jurisdiction over crypto-cur-
rency because it has undetermined legal 
status in the country.” This is because 
while the government has not accepted 
it as currency, it is yet to be recognised as 
security by SEBI or any other govern-
ment body. Despite this, crypto-cur-
rency is being traded 
through exchanges in 
Ind ia, with transactions 
having peaked shortly af-
ter demonetisation.
In August 2017, SEBI 
formed a Committee on 
Financial and Regulatory 
Technologies, to assess 
how it could use block-
chain technology (the 
tech behind crypto-cur-
rency) in “FinTech” ser-
vices. The source in SEBI 
clarified that the com-
mittee was “tasked with 
assessing the potential of 
blockchain 
technology 
and the public ledger sys-
tem in all financial tech-
nology such as leveraging 
it for the purpose of regulating markets.”
The state governments are also looking 
for ways to use blockchain technology, 
says a top official of the Ministry of Elec-
tronics and Information Technology. 
There is also discussion amongst media 
innovators as to how to use blockchain 
technology to combat fake news.
Even 
to 
regulate 
crypto-currency 
 und er the Foreign Exchange Manage-
ment Act, the RBI would first have to dec-
lare it a foreign currency. Once the com-
mittee has presented a report to the 
finance ministry, it will be clear if the gov-
ernment will adopt the Egyptian Grand 
Mufti’s stance or that of Japan and Rus-
sia. Japan having declared Bitcoin a legal 
tender, thousands of retail services are 
now accepting it as payment. Russia is 
considering a crypto-Rouble on the lines 
of the crypto-currency called Ethereum, 
developed by a Russian entrepreneur. 
Meanwhile, celebrities in India and 
abroad have started endorsing cry pto-
currency in the non-regulated environ-
ment with little reaction from the aut-
horities. When Paris Hilton tweeted 
support for an upcoming crypto-coin, the 
United States Securities and Exc hange 
Commission (SEC) took note imm-
ediately and released an advisory on 
“Pot entially Unlawful Promotion of Ini-
tial Coin Offerings and Other Invest-
ments by Celebrities and Others.” The 
media pointed out the ambivalence in 
this because the SEC was yet to classify 
digital coins as either a currency or as a 
speculative asset. There have also been 
rep orts by Indian media of domestic cel-
ebrities endorsing cry-
pto-cur rency by highli g h-
ting how much they have 
been trading in it. But no 
warnings have been iss-
ued by Indian aut horities 
to these celebrities.
Many 
“miners”—cod-
ers who verify cryptocur-
rency transactions— pre-
fer 
to 
trade 
with 
exchanges abroad. This 
shows the potential for 
use of crypto-currency in 
hawala. Cash, turned into 
crypto-currency, can be 
passed through the inter-
net and encashed in sev-
eral countries without 
revealing its origin.
For now, any trade in 
crypto-currency would attract a capital 
gains tax as is the case with securities. 
With user data in their hands, the IT 
 Department is likely to send notices to 
those who don’t declare gains.
The Indian exchanges seem to work on 
the “trust” model—the very system that 
Bitcoin’s mythical “inventor”, Satoshi 
Nakamoto, was working against. In his 
2008 White Paper on crypto-currency, 
he outlined the philosophy for Bitcoin. 
Governments had failed to regulate cur-
rency, banks overcharged on transac-
tions and crooks in the financial system 
went unpunished. The middleman must 
be rooted out—but the exchanges have 
proved to be middlemen, albeit ones who 
charge far less than banks.

offer a digital wallet that they hold on 
beh alf of the users. Thus, a user can view 
the wallet and issue directions to buy or 
sell digital coins, but cannot do it direc-
tly. BuyUCoin is a Delhi-based start-up 
that has 21,200 KYC-verified users, ano-
ther 27,540 awaiting KYC with docu-
ments uploaded and a total 1,11,900 
signed up. The verified users hold around 
Rs 5 crore in their bank accounts.
CEO Shivam Thakral points out that all 
these accounts are being maintained by 
a public sector bank “because private 
banks do not want to deal with compa-
nies that have anything to do with cry-
pto-currency”. But the underlying phi-
losophy is the “trust” of the user. 
In 2016, Thakral and his friends were 
buying and selling coins through credit 
and debit card transactions. In Novem-
ber 2016, following demonetisation, 
Thakral found more Indians taking an 
interest in crypto-currencies. That led 
him and his friends to register as a com-
pany in 2017, hire space on servers and 
start operating out of an office in West 
Delhi’s Karol Bagh commercial area.
In December 2017, when IT authorities 
turned up at his home, Thakral’s family 
was not thrilled. It took some explaining, 
especially when some local newspapers 
reported that the IT department had 
seized Rs 33 crore from them. The sei-
zure list showed otherwise—the sleuths 
cloned their cloud servers and digital 
drives for the data on users and “took 
Rs 20,000 in petty cash that we had kept 
in the office to buy food,” smiles Thakral.
“Every time the government says 
something negative about crypto-cur-
rency, we find more users sign up with 
our exchange,” says Thakral.
The official warnings against investing 
or dealing with crypto-currencies have 
not dampened its price. Bitcoin price 
soared post-demonetisation, apparently 
because Indians started taking an inter-
est in the crypto-currency. In Dec ember 
2016, the price of a Bitcoin had peaked to 
approximately $19,500 and then crashed

by 25 per cent. On January 2, when the 
finance minister clarified that cry pto-
currency was not legal tender, this did 
not impact the price of Bitcoin. In fact, it 
rose back to $17,000 on January 5.
“As an investor who seeks long-term 
capital appreciation, I find the idea of 
1000 per cent annual returns to be more 
indicative of investment bubbles than 
anything else, especially since there is no 
underlying asset represented by these 
crypto-currencies. While I appreciate 
the power of blockchain technology and 
how it can result in smart contracts that 
can revolutionise many sectors, I refuse 
to believe that the crypto-mania is very 
different from the tulip mania of the 
1600s,” says Gurgaon-based entrepre-
neur and CFA Ashwini Anand.
Sound investments don’t fluctuate in 
value by 30 per cent on a daily basis, con-
tends Anand. “This does not mean that I 
am risk-averse. I have a significant 
 allocation to a diversified portfolio of 
small-cap and mid-cap stocks (via mut-
ual funds), from which I expect to get 
about 18-24 per cent p.a. compounded 
over holding periods of 5-7 years. These 
return expectations are rational and 
 justify the volatility inherent to these 
types of investments,”
There are several theories as to what 
drives the price of the volatile Bitcoin (or 
other crypto-currency). In 2013, Bitcoin 
value had peaked at $1,000 before it 
crashed following an announcement by 
an exchange, MT GOX, which then 
 controlled a majority of the Bitcoin 
trades. The exchange revealed that it had 
lost 8,50,000 Bitcoins to hackers. While 
coders and developers went back to the 
drawing board, MT GOX filed for 
 bankruptcy. Conspiracy theories raged 
on dark web chat rooms about it being a 
covert operation by government spies. 
In early 2017, when the price of  a Bit-
coin surged to $1,000, experts predicted 
that the end-of-year price would be 
$3,000. After  Japan accepted Bitcoin as a 
currency in April, the  value crossed the 
$3,000 mark by June and kept  climbing. 
Another mad dive for  purchases ensued, 
and the price peaked further. 
The highest concentration of cry pto-
currency miners is in China, which 
stopped withdrawals in February 2017, 
restarting them some months later. The 
resumed trading in China and elsewhere 
pushed the Bitcoin price to $19,500 in

COIN CON
T
HE Bitcoin model can be compared to a nuclear reaction 
sans the speed and damage. The programme, which was 
written in C++, generated a first or ‘genesis’ block of 50 
coins. It was released to open-source software directory Source-
Forge with a hidden message which set the date at January 3, 
2009 and contained a statement of the bank-bypassing philos-
ophy. It is somewhat akin to the game Monopoly, where the 
players are first seeded with ‘cash’ from the ‘bank’. About every 
ten minutes another block was released, and ‘mining’ the blocks 
carried a reward of 50 Bitcoins (now 25). 
Transactions between users are recorded in a block, which is 
verified by coders (‘miners’) who solve a complex maths problem 
on their computers and are given 25 Bitcoins for each block that 
they verify by generating a hash key. The verified blocks are 
chained (hence the name blockchain) to each other through the 
‘hash’ and recorded in a public register or ledger which is not 
held centrally and thus, not susceptible to attacks.
The “hash” is a unique identifier, and multiple results are put 
to rest through a majority vote. Theoretically, that can be a 
chink in its armour because an attacker could gang up with mul-
tiple false results to force-verify a false transaction as a genuine 
one. That would throw the system out of gear. 
The incremental difficulty (reset every few days) of the 
maths problem and the high cost of mining make it difficult for 
attackers to outvote honest miners. Mining requires a faster, 
heat-resistant (ASIC) chip working full time, which costs around 
Rs 3-4 lakh each, plus the high-watt power requirements. Bitcoin 
miners now work in pools, with the largest rigs reported to be in 
China, accounting for around 80 per cent of the hash rate.
S
ATOSHI Nakamoto cut the umbilical cord and fell off the 
internet in 2011, starting a race to locate and identify him. 
This happened just after another Bitcoin developer, Gavin 
Andresen emailed Nakamoto to tell him that he had accepted 
an invitation from the CIA to speak about crypto-currency. Like 
Andresen, Hal Finney had only communicated with Nakamoto 
through the internet, using an anonymous email service.
There has been no conclusive proof of who Nakamoto might 
actually be. Conspiracy theories have even pointed at Elon Musk, 
without much of a reaction. There is another set that believe 
that Nakamoto was a combination of Dai, Finney and another 
cryptographer, Nick Szabo, who wrote about crypto-currency 
in a 1998 research paper on “bit gold”. Amongst the first lot of 
cypherpunks was Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.
All denied being Nakamoto, though Forbes came close to iden-
tifying Finney as the Bitcoin founder. This was based on forensic 
analysis that matched Finney’s writing with that of Nakamoto. 
A media house had also found a Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto living 
not far from Finney’s house in California. Two theories emerged. 
Either, Dorian Nakamoto was the real person or else Finney had 
assumed his neighbour’s name as a cryptic identity.
In the first blockchain of Bitcoin, Nakamoto had kept a line 
of text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for 
banks,” referring to a news report published by The Times in 
the UK. Some claim that it was done to establish a time stamp 
of the first blockchain. Others say that it was the reason that 
Bitcoin was finally released to the world—central banks were 
simply inflating the capitalist system, the philosophy on which 
the crypto-currency was developed.
cent, only to have climbed back up to 
$17,000 at the time of writing.
In 2017, Asian markets overtook the US 
in crypto-currency trading and acceler-
ated the evolution of Bitcoin from the 
egalitarian, de-centralised currency into 
the speculative asset it now is. It is not 
surprising then that Goldman Sachs is 
rumoured to have created a trade desk 
exclusively for crypto-currency fut-
ures—one that will permit calling shorts 
as in conventional financial markets. 
In Japan, more than 5,000 merchants 
accept the currency, but with a cap on 
the maximum amount allowed for a sin-
gle transaction from a single entity. The 
largest car dealership in the country has 
capped it at $100,000. Global companies 
like EY Switzerland have also started to 
accept clients’ fees in crypto-currency, 
set up wallets for employees to receive 
emoluments and set up advisory servi-
ces on the new currency.
Genesis
The foundation for crypto- currency was 
laid through an academic paper written 
by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor. They 
proposed a system to deter attacks on 
computers through spam email. It was 
later named “proof-of-work”, by its dev-
eloper Adam Back in 1997. It verified that 
the sender of an email was genuine and 
not someone trying extortion.
In 1998,  Wei Dai theorised a currency 
that would exclude central control. “I am 
fascinated by Tim May’s crypto-anarchy. 
Unlike the communities traditionally 
associated with the word “anarchy”, in a 
crypto-anarchy the government is not 
temporarily destroyed but permanently 
forbidden and permanently unneces-
sary,” states his paper.
In 2008, Dai’s philosophy was reflected 
in the White Paper on Bitcoin that was 
authored by “Satoshi Nakamoto”. This 
was  transmitted over an email group for 
cryptographers and attracted coder Hal 
Finney, who went on to develop the code.
The first Bitcoin transaction was Naka-
moto transferring 50 Bitcoins to Hal 
Finney. Once it was put out to Source-
Forge, other coders started to mine the 
hash keys by verifying the transactions 
through 
“proof-of-work”. 
The 
first 
36,000 blocks were mined by Nakamoto. 
At 50 Bitcoins per mining, that places 
the total number mined by him at 
18,14,400, of which around 11 lakh were 
never spent. That makes his net worth 
on December 17 about $22.5 billion, 
making him one of the richest men in the 
world, albeit a missing one (see box 2).
 Crypto-currency carries the baggage 
of speculation on an unknown quantity 
and money-laundering. So does fiat 
 currency, but no major bank officials are 
currently behind bars. Blockchain and 
crypto-currency are innovations at the 
intersection of finance and technology.

VISA BLUES
by Arindam Mukherjee
I
N a bid to enforce President Donald 
Trump’s ‘Buy American Hire Ameri-
can’ policy, the US government 
might 
put 
in 
place 
further 
 restrictions on H1B visas, of which 
India is a major beneficiary. The 
current proposals to not extend H-1B 
visa of those waiting for permanent 
residency or a green card is likely to aff-
ect half-a-million Indians working in 
the US. Though the US government has 
said that there is no change in the H1B 
visa policy for the moment, it is consid-
ering extending the H1B visas by just 
one year instead of three for those 
holders whose green card application 
is under process. The proposal was cir-
culated as a memo by the Department 
of Homeland Security in the US and 
seeks to end extensions to H-1B visas of 
those whose applications for green 
cards are being processed.
 The proposed policy potentially means 
that if visas are not extended at all, or 
extended for just one year, several H1B 
visa holders might have to return to India. 
According to rough estimates, between 
500,000 and 750,000 people might be 
affected by the move. And that could 
 severely affect engineering and IT talent 
in the US and take a toll on the bottom­
lines of Indian companies who send IT 
workers to the US.
Experts are of the opinion that if passed, 
the policy will be detrimental to both US 
and Indian companies. “US businesses 
have already expressed displeasure with 
the changes. The industry body has rep­
ortedly termed this a ‘bad policy’,” says 
D.D. Mishra, research director, Gartner 
India. “Businesses in the US are worried 
about losing talented people who have 
been working in the country for a long 
time. This will be a no­win situation for 
India as well as US businesses and IT 
professionals will be at the receiving end.”
At the same time, Indian IT companies 
could be looking at a huge financial hit. 
“The impact of this will be quite big on 
Indian IT companies as this category of 
engineers and IT workers are billed at 
very high rates,” says Jaideep Mehta, IT 
sector expert and CEO, Vccircle.com. “If 
they are suddenly taken out of the sys­
tem, we are talking in terms of billions of 
dollars of loss to the system. This is very 
 serious and not a trivial matter. Even if 
300,000 people were to be affected, at a 
modest annual billing of $200,000, the 
total billing will be in the range of $ 
40­50 billion, assuming reasonable 
 capacity utilisation.”
This is not the first time there has been 
an attack on H1B visa holders. A couple of 
months ago, a new legislation—the 
Protect and Grow American Jobs Act, HR 
170—introduced by Republican U.S. 
Representative  Darrell Issa, was passed 
by voice vote in the House Judiciary 
Committee of the US Congress. The bill 
proposed to raise the  minimum salary of 
H1B visa  holders from $60,000 to $90,000, 
and also to put a check on the work vis as 
used by a slew of Indian companies who 
send  their workers to the US.
There was a general opinion that HR 
170 would harm US businesses and imp­
ose an extraordinary amount of bureau­

cratic red tape on a programme that 
contributes greatly to the country’s 
prosperity. It was designed to disrupt the 
marketplace, threaten  thousands of US 
jobs and stifle US  innovation.
The proposed increase in the minimum 
salary of H1B holders is certain to hit the 
margins of the US projects of Indian 
companies. Also, with other  restrictions 
related to hiring in the US, companies will 
be forced to hire locally. Given the differ­
ence in salary between American and 
Indian workers, this will increase the 
wage bill of the companies.
Before this, there was another bill 
floated in the US Congress to control 
imm igration, particularly through H1B 
visas. In September, Senators Tom Cotton 
and David Perdue proposed the Ref o r­
ming American Immigration for Strong 
Employment (RAISE) Act, which aimed 
to reduce the number of legal migrants 
(green card holders) allowed in the US by 
40 per cent in the first year and by 50 per 
cent over a decade.
HR 170 is more focused on H1B visa 
holders, and is likely to impact Indian 
companies more as they are the largest 
beneficiaries of these visas. It specifically 
prohibits employers in the US from rep­
lacing Americans with H1B employees.
Though India’s software representative 
body, NASSCOM, feels that there is no 
concrete proposal in this regard and there 
has been no official announce­
ment regarding the cancella­
tion of extension of H1B visas, 
it is of the opinion that any 
such move would be disrup­
tive and would be detrimental 
to both Indian as well as 
American companies.
Even in the US there is oppo­
sition to the new proposals. “It 
will be a catastrophic move for 
US companies as the H1B 
programme is their life and 
blood,” says Rogelio Caceres, 
co­founder & CCO of the US­
based LCR Capital.  “If (visa) 
extensions are eliminated or 
limited, half a million engi­
neers could be affected. That 
would decimate the R&D and 
development work in the US. 
Many projects would be 
 affected. As it is, there is a talent shortage 
in the US—this will be talent elimination. 
There is already a demand and supply gap 
of engineering talent and US universities 
are not equipped to fill this gap.”
O
NE fallout of the entire campaign 
has been that there is a heightened 
demand for other visas, such as the 
EB5 visas for permanent residency 
in the US. “In 2017, there was a significant 
demand for the first time for EB5 visas 
through which one can get a green card 
directly. Many of them were from tec­
hies,” says Mark Davies, global chairman 
of the US­based Davies and Associates 
LLC. The EB5 visa gives a green card 
dir ectly in exchange for an investment of 
$500,000 in the US. “Over the last one 
year, interest on EB5 visa has increased 
by over 70 per cent as the attacks on H1B 
increased,” says Caceres.
So, will the Trump administration gar­
ner enough support to clear the propos­
als against the H1B visa programme? 
Experts, both in India and the US, feel 
that with opposition against the propos­
als mounting primarily in the US and 
with the US IT industry vehemently 
 opposed to such proposals, there is little 
chance of these getting passed. “There is 
little support even in the Republican 
party on the proposals. Donald Trump 
doesn’t have enough support on this 
radical proposal,” says Caceres.
Mehta, however, feels that Trump can 
still pull it through. He says: “Despite the 
lack of support in the US, especially the 
industry, I am not so 
confident that Donald 
Trump will fail as he has 
been successful in get­
ting the HR 170 bill 
passed and also the 
travel ban cleared. The 
administration’s usual 
strategy is to take an 
extreme measure, and 
then dilute it a little to 
achieve 
what 
they 
wanted in the first place. 
He 
may 
just 
pull 
through this as well and 
that will be detrimental 
to both the US and 
Indian industry.”
There is also a pro­
posal 
under 
which 
spouses of H1B visa 
holders will be denied a 
work permit in the US. This again is exp­
ected to be detrimental to Indian techies 
and discourage many from choosing the 
US as a work destination. “As a majority of 
the IT professionals have a working 
spouse, many of them will find it difficult 
to migrate due to the restrictions,” says 
Mishra. “The US will gradually lose its 
significance as an interesting destination 
for IT professionals and this will impact 
US business more. These changes are 
akin to shooting the tyres of a racing car.”
India needs to up the ante and do some­
thing about the ongoing H1B programme 
in the US considering that almost 70 per 
cent of all H1B visa holders are from India 
and India corners a significant number of 
the 85,000 H1B visas issued every year. 
The issue has to be taken up diplomati­
cally and bilaterally to ensure that both 
the US and Indian IT industries are not 
adversely affected. The iron is hot in the 
US. This is the time for India to act. O
“If visa 
 extensions are 
eliminated or 
limited, half 
a million Indian 
 engineers in 
the US could 
be  affected.”

 B
Ack in the 1980s, the diminu-
tive Dornier 228 (Do-228) was 
part of a fleet that connected 
some remote corners of the cou-
ntry. Now, three decades later—
and after a couple of ambitious 
homegrown civilian aircraft projects—
the Dornier can possibly lay claim to be 
the first light transport aircraft for civ-
ilian use that will be fully manufac-
tured in India. That’s because the air-
craft recently received a type certi- 
fication from the Directorate General 
of civil Aviation (DGcA) which would 
allow it to resume civilian duties. It’s a 
second innings of sorts for the 19-sea-
ter airplane manufactured by Hindu-
stan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).
Ever since Vayudoot—the feeder airline 
service started in 1981 when today’s 
bustling small towns were actually rem­
ote outbacks—shut down in the mid­
1990s, the Do­228 has mostly been a 
military aircraft in India apart from flying 
with the Coast Guard. With the DGCA 
certification—the standards globally for 
civilian aircraft are tougher than military 
aircraft—the Dornier can enter the fray 
as the government’s Regional Connecti­
vity Scheme or UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam 
Nagrik) rolls out.
“The Do­228’s commercial flight certifi­
cation by DGCA is a positive develop­
ment,” says Amber Dubey, partner and 
India head of Aerospace and Defence at 
global consultancy KPMG. He reckons it 
provides an alternative to other 19­seat­
ers like the Canadian DHC Twin Otters, 
the Czech­made L­410 and the PZL M28 
(now owned by Lockheed Martin).
The Do­228 was designed by German 
aircraft­maker Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH 
from whom HAL bought a production 
license in 1983 to manufacture these 
planes for the Asian market. So far, HAL’s 
Kanpur division has produced around 
130 Dornier aircraft for the Indian Air 
Force, Navy, Coast Guard, early airline 
ventures like Vayudoot besides exporting 
to Mauritius and Seychelles. Some of the 
other Indian customers included UB Air, 
Vijay Mallya’s maiden airline venture 
and Shimla­based Jagson Airlines.
HAL reckons the upgraded version, Do­
228­201, is best suited under the Make in 
India category for UDAN. Its chairman  
T. Suvarna Raju has previously said that 
the company sees ‘big business opportu­
nity in this segment for the next 10 years’. 
People in the know claim that around 15 
agencies, many of them domestic airlines, 
have shown interest.
A year ago, while on a visit to the Kanpur 
facility, minister of state for civil aviation 
Jayant Sinha said there was a demand for 
at least 200 aircraft in the category. Back 
in the 1980s, the Vayudoot fleet of ten 
Do­228s largely depended on Dornier

GmbH for spares. That’s no longer the 
situation, aviation industry veterans 
point out. “Product support will never be 
a problem whosoever operates this air­
craft. The only suggestion I would make 
to the government and various airlines is 
that a plan be worked out for the next 
5­10 years,” says A.K. Saxena, a former 
MD (Bangalore complex)  at HAL. “In the 
aircraft ind ustry, we need a plan for 5­6 
years because materials have to be impo­
rted so that we can keep churning out the 
aircraft engines, accessories, systems 
and avionics.” The Dornier is suited for 
shorter routes and, in all fairness, is an 
indigenously produced aircraft, he adds.
Ironically, a fully homegrown civilian 
aircraft has been a dream that India’s 
aeronautics community has pursued 
with little success for 
more than two decades. It’s 
quite a long story actually, 
one that started with 
Saras, a 14­seater that the 
Bangalore­based National 
Aerospace 
Laboratories 
(NAL) began building in 
the 1990s. The designers 
struggled with the initial 
prototype 
which 
was 
overweight. Of course, the 
project pressed on and 
the plane also featured 
at Bangalore’s biennial 
air shows. But the project 
took a blow in 2009 when 
one of the Saras prototypes 
crashed during a flight test, 
killing three officers on 
board. Since then, it has struggled to get 
back on track though there’s word that 
flight testing is likely to resume soon.
In 2010, even as the Saras was grounded, 
there came a more ambitious project to 
build a 70­ to 90­seater aircraft aimed 
primarily at connecting small cities and 
designed for Indian conditions. The task 
of mapping out the process got off to a 
flying start and the country’s top aero­
space experts were involved in preparing 
a feasibility report that outlined the 
funding and manufacture. The project, 
then estimated at Rs 7,500 crore, had in 
its sights a 90­seater turbofan aircraft 
that would be designed and produced in 
partnership with private industry. Sadly, 
it couldn’t go beyond the initial planning. 
As one insider puts it, not everybody was 
convinced with the config­
uration 
decided 
upon. 
“After that, it was a slide 
completely,” the person 
says. “The 70 to 90­seater 
market segment is very 
dicey, sandwiched in bet­
ween the big gorillas and 
the small plane­makers.”
The Do­228, like most 
19­seaters, is a non­pres­
surised aircraft, and could 
face a challenge when it 
comes to travelling com­
fort, says KPMG’s Amber 
Dubey. He also points out 
that HAL may have to cre­
ate options for leasing the 
aircraft themselves bec­
ause small regional service 
operators may not have the ability to buy 
aircraft. “In the UDAN scheme,” says 
Saxena, “many routes may actually not 
be viable with bigger aircraft. This air­
craft is suited for shorter routes and 
opt imum capacity utilisation.”
 With the UDAN scheme, the governm­
ent hopes to stimulate air travel by con­
necting small towns and with concessions 
on fares—operators have to cap the fare of 
some seats at Rs 2,500 for an hour­long 
flight. In the first phase, five operators 
including Air India’s arm Alliance Air, Air 
Odisha, Spicejet, Turbo Megha and Capt 
G.R. Gopinath’s Deccan Charters have 
been awarded 128 routes connecting 43 
airports. The bidding for the second 
phase concluded sometime ago.
Dubey says UDAN is a great initiative 
that should have taken off a decade 
and a half ago. “The Naresh Chandra 
Commi ttee in 2003 spoke about creating 
a regio nal connectivity fund but the rec­
ommendation never got implemented,” 
he says, adding that it was only under the 
National Civil Aviation Policy 2016 that 
the government finally took the decision 
to provide fiscal and monetary incentives 
for regional connectivity. “The results 
are for all to see. Market leader Indigo 
has disrupted its one single­aircraft fleet 
strategy and has gone for turboprobs. 
SpiceJet has ordered another 50 turbo­
props and is considering bringing in 100 
seaplanes on top of that,” he says. Spice Jet, 
which currently operates Bombardier 
Q400 planes in a 78 seater configuration, 
last year signed an agreement to buy 50 
Q400 aircraft that would be 90 seaters.
Dubey explains that just Delhi and 
Mumbai have less than 5 per cent of the 
country’s population but nearly 40 per 
cent of the Indian air traffic. “There are 
dozens of places of significant importance 
in the interiors of India from a population, 
tourism and industry perspective but lack 
air connectivity since there was no fiscal 
of monetary support,” he says. He feels 
that UDAN is here to stay. “But yes, like in 
any industry, availability of a three­year 
subsidy doesn’t guarantee long­term fin­
ancial success.” It would depend on the 
operator’s choice of routes, destination, 
fleet, people, branding and cost structure 
besides its aligning with large carriers.
Will HAL hit pay dirt with the Dornier? 
UDAN holds the key. O

T
hree time Madhya Pradesh Chief 
Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan 
said farmers are always in the 
priority of my government but 
at the same time we have not 
neglected other sections of society on their cost. 
Chouhan claimed  that even after 14 years of 
bjp regime in the state  bjp continues to remain 
unchallenged and congress is hardly a force 
to reckon with in the  forthcoming assembly 
election. Excerpts of the interview-
 After completion of record 12 years as 
Chief Minister, what is your next goal? 
My one and only goal has been and will always 
be to establish Madhya Pradesh as the most 
developed state of the country. I never count 
years or months. In noted Urdu poet Bashir 
Badra words - Jis din se chala hoon meri manzil 
pe nazar hai, aankhon ne kabhi meel ka patthar 
nahin dekha (From Day One my eyes are firmly 
set on the goal; I never bothered to check the 
milestones).
 You are doing lot for agriculture 
sector and farmers and what do you 
feel? Are you paying equal attention to 
other sections, too?
In fact, no amount of assistance and help to 
farmers is enough, given the decade of neglect 
of farming and peasants post-Independence. 
They feed the country. Neglect of farming and 
farmers for decades resulted in farmers’ weaning 
away from their ancestral occupations. This 
has necessitated it for the government to pay 
greater attention to farm sector and farmers to 
make agriculture a profitable proposition. This 
is what we did in Madhya Pradesh and it has 
paid off. Benefiting from the facilities and help 
provided by the government the farmers are 
gradually coming on a better footing. Madhya 
Pradesh owes to farmers the distinction of 
being the state with highest agriculture growth 
rate. It gives me satisfaction that farmers are 
coming back to the plough with enthusiasm.
I have ensured that no section of society 
is denied the fruits of development. Equal

is no

improvement in all sectors. All fiscal indicators 
are in favour of the state. The contribution 
of Madhya Pradesh to country’s GDP has 
increased from 3.8 to 4.3 percent. State’s 
contribution to country’s food grain production 
has gone up from 7.1 percent to 11.38 percent 
and to power generation from 4.8 percent to 
5.9 percent. Madhya Pradesh has maintained 
double digit economic growth rate for last 
many years and has been revenue surplus for 
last 12 years. The per capita income of the state 
has increased from Rs. 14 thousand to `72,600. 
State’s annual budget size has increased from 
`21,647 crore to 1,85,564 crore. State’s own tax 
revenue has gone up over seven times from Rs. 
6,805 crore to 43,447 crore. The fiscal deficit 
has been within the prescribed limits. All these 
factors bear out the fact that the state has 
managed its finances well.
 After Gujarat poll results Congress is 
going to create bit challenge in MP. How 
do you rate the prospects of Congress in 
assembly main election?
Although political prudence dictates that 
opponents should never be underestimated; 
however, I have no hitch in saying that Congress 
in no challenge at all in Madhya Pradesh. 
Congress rules the state for over four decades 
but miserably failed to convert state potential 
into performance . As a result  the continued 
to be under performer and carried the stigma 
of “BIMARU STATE” still congress has no vision 
for the development of the state and welfare of 
people. Both their leaders and ranks are highly 
despaired and disappointed and are seeing no 
prospects of winning elections for many- many 
years to come in the state. They stand no chance. 
 To what extent Policy of Modi 
government will be helpful for 
prospects of bjp in MP?
Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi 
is undisputed leader of not only the BJP but 
of the country.  Under his visionary and able 
leadership India has emerged as a most 
powerful country in the comity of nations. 
International agencies and institutions like IMF 
and others have predicted that in a couple of 
years India will be a major economic power 
to reckon with, leaving behind many most 
developed countries. His policies are pro-
poor and he is committed to stamping out 
corruption in the country. His policies are 
definitely going to benefit the BJP in Madhya 
Pradesh, too.
 Do you think you will have to face 
anti- incumbency ?
NO. Not at all. On the contrary, there will be 
pro-incumbency factor at play, leading to 
landslide victory for the BJP in the state. The 
policies of both central and state governments 
have benefited the poor and the weaker 
sections the most. Despite the diatribe carried 
out by the Congress and other vested interests, 
the masses very well appreciate the truth. They 
are wise enough to see through their designs. 
 Besides all negative factors what are 
the positive nodes which may ensure 
your fourth consequent victory?
BJP has always contested elections on 
development planks and the next election will 
also be fought on development issues.  There 
are no negative factors.
 What are 12 main achievements of 12 
years of your Chief Ministership in MP?  
Twelve major achievements are-
• Women empowerment (Fifty percent 
reservation in local bodies and 33 percent 
in government jobs) 
• Revolution in power sector. 24x7 electricity 
to households and 10 hours to farm sector, 
which was unthought-of a decade ago
• Excellent road network. In Congress regime 
Madhya Pradesh’s roads were a butt of 
jokes
• Madhya Pradesh leads country in 
agricultural growth rate that averages over 
20 percent for last four years
• Madhya Pradesh emerged as the Best 
Tourism State
• Unprecedented urban as well as rural 
development. Proper infrastructure created 
and sanitation promoted
• Better education, skill development and 
self-employment for youths
• Strong social security cover provided to the 
poor of all sections of society
• Awareness about conservation of rivers 
and environment enhanced
• Social harmony promoted. More dignified 
life to scheduled castes
• Members of Scheduled Tribes integrated 
with mainstream
• Communal harmony and peace prevails
attention has been paid to well-being of 
all sections of society with special focus on 
traditionally weakest sections. 
 Now this is election year as far as MP 
is concerned.  Expectations of various 
cadres of employees are very high. 
Election year or no-election year, my 
government has always ensured justice to all 
cadres of employees. We have given them the 
benefit of the 7th Pay Commission. They are 
being paid DA at par with their counterparts 
in central government. Adhyapak cadre has 
been created to ensure due respect and dignity 
with better remuneration to teachers who were 
given the derogatory term of Shikshakarmi by 
the previous Congress government. Genuine 
problems of the employees have been 
duly addressed and redressed with utmost 
consideration within the resources at our 
command. However, the anomalies, if any, 
will be rectified in due course with utmost 
consideration and sympathy.
 What is the progress of Bhavantar 
Yojana in MP?
After minor initial hiccups the Bhavantar Yojana 
has been implemented successfully in the state. 
A sum of `834 crore has already been paid to 
35 lakh farmers.  It has proved a boon for the 
farmers and ensured remunerative returns of 
their produce to them.
 What about onion purchasing?
In view of the crisis the onion-growing farmers 
faced due to lack of adequate storage facility for 
storage of bumper onion production, I decided 
that the state government would purchase the 
onion from the farmers. We purchased onion 
worth `682 crore and the farmers earned a 
profit of `511 crore. This baled them out of a 
grave crisis. 
Not only onion, we also purchased moong 
worth `1123 crore, tuar `352 crore, masoor 
`78 crore and urd worth `210 crore. By this 
step of the government the farmers earned a 
profit of `1064 crore.  
 What about fiscal management?
Madhya Pradesh has performed well for last 12 
years Madhya Pradesh has enjoyed a very good 
reputation for prudent fiscal management. 
This has led to availability of greater funds for 
development and welfare schemes that led to

REAL PADMAN

HE machine came first, the dau­
ghter only later, quips Aruna­
chalam Muruganantham, ton­
gue in cheek. “All because of my 
obsession with the sanitary pad.” 
The 55­year­old is referr ing to 
how his daughter was born only ten 
years after his marriage. For, his wife 
had walked out on him, protesting 
against his obsession with his sanitary 
pad project. Shanthi did ret urn to live 
with him, but only after he succeeded 
and won social recognition.
Not just recognition. Today, even 
Bolly wood fame. Actor Askhay Kumar 
decided to make PadMan, based on 
Murugananth am’s mission that has freed 
thousands of women from 
the shackles of unhygienic 
living during their periods. 
First Muru ganantham and 
now Aks hay have together 
dared where no Indian 
man has been before: the 
sensitive issue of menstru­
ation that comes with tab­
oos that confine women to 
the dark corners of their 
homes. The absence of a 
pad used to instil dread in 
rural women all those three days.
Coimbatore­based Muruganantham, 
had married in 1998. Once he saw his wife 
smuggling a dirty piece of rag into the 
bathroom, and that’s when he realised 
most Indian women don’t use sanitary 
napkins. “She was hoarding dirty rags 
with which I’d hesitate to clean my two­
wheeler. She said commercial pads were 
too expensive. That impelled me to find a 
low­cost solution,” he recalls.
Muruganantham’s wife was the first to 
reject his pad, which was nothing but a 
wad of medical cotton tightly rolled up 
and held together by a string. After his 
own sisters refused to use them, Muru­
ganantham enlisted a few medical college 
students to try out his product. He gave 
them a feedback form, and found that two 
girls were filling up the form for the entire 
group. “So I tried using my napkin by 
wearing it with a football bladder filled 
with goat blood to see if it can absorb the 
blood. The experiment was a miserable 
failure. At this, I collected the used sani­
tary napkins of the college girls for closer 
inspection at home. When my mother 
found what I was doing, she left me to live 
with my sisters,” Muruganantham recol­
lects with candid humour, almost laugh­
ing at his crazy journey.
But nothing deterred the 
man. The school dropout 
finally found out the secret 
of the sanitary napkin: it 
was made of cellulose cut 
into fibres to enable abso­
rption. Now he needed a 
machine to make the pads. 
So Muruganantham desi­
gned one machine to cut 
the cellulose sheet into 
fibre, another to compress, 
cut and wrap them into usable rectangu­
lar pads that would be treated with UV 
light to make them germ­free. Having 
worked in a welding shop, he had some 
knowledge about machines. “It took me 
eight years of trial and error to design the 
machines that would make low­cost 
pads: just Rs 2 each, compared to those 
made by the MNCs that are priced any­
where above Rs 6 to Rs 100,” he says. 
Since the machines cost only Rs 2 lakh, 
It took eight 
years of trial 
and error for 
the man to  
perfect the 
machine that 
would make 
low-cost pads. 
A school dropout won in his quirky but noble mission 
that has now inspired Bollywood to make a movie

they could easily be purchased by self­
help groups part fina nced by NGOs. And 
he now uses cellulose from wood pulp to 
make the pads biodegradable.
Making the pads was only the lesser 
challenge; getting the unschooled women 
to use them was next, Muruganantham 
realised. “I had addressed affordability, 
but what about availability and aware­
ness? So I decided that only women can 
do these two jobs, since in a village only a 
woman can talk to another woman about 
periods. And if a collective of women 
could make these pads and distribute 
them they would gain greater accepta­
bility and also remain affordable. The 
women were also excited about a steady 
income by making and selling these pads,” 
explains the social entrepreneur. But first 
the men of the village had to be convinced.
So when Muruganantham visited vil­
lages to speak about the business oppor­
tunity, he had to take the permission of 
the woman’s husband, father and brother 
and even the village sarpanch to demon­
strate the machines and the business 
model. At the last count, his pads have 
reached 40 million women, still a long 
way from the 90 per cent uncovered 
population. Nearly 5,000 of his machines 
are working across the country, including 
the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and 
the Northeast. “When we installed a mac­
hine at Sar Saria village in Uttarakhand, a 
70­year­old woman held my hands and 
thanked me for providing dignity and 
convenience to her granddaughters, 
something that was denied to her,” he 
rec alls. “Such moments keep me going.”
Muruganantham exhibits an amazing 
grasp of the market forces dominated by 
just two big names: Unilever and Procter 
and Gamble. “Before informed audiences, 
I openly address these companies by 
names as I have nothing to be afraid of 
them. In fact, I told Uni­
lever executives (while 
speaking on rural market­
ing) that they posed me no 
threat since they were 
concentrating only on ten 
per cent of the women in 
cities. I had the remaining 
90 per cent of the market 
all to myself,” he shrugs. 
“In effect, I did not snatch 
anyone’s market share; 
ins tead I created a new market. They 
cannot compete with me because my 
costs are low and my reach is far greater. 
Also theirs is a profit­oriented product, 
but mine is entirely a need­based prod­
uct created for social awareness,” he 
opens up in broken English, peppered 
with anecdotal truisms.
“W
HEN I tell a foreign audience 
that 90 per cent of Indian women 
have no access to sanitary nap­
kin, there is a visible disbelief. 
But there is hardly a ripple when I say the 
same thing to an Indian crowd. So I have 
to ask our Indian brothers and sisters, 
‘Do you know what our rural women use 
during their periods? Rags, sawdust, dry 
leaves and even hay.’ Only then they are 
shocked.” Such awe tactics are needed to 
stir up society’s conscience, he believes.
Muruganantham is nevertheless disap­
pointed that sanitary napkins have been 
slapped with a 12 per cent GST. He argues 
that the health benefit costs of cheaper 
pads would actually surpass the revenue 
earned through the tax.
Muruganantham’s hum­
our comes in handy in his 
venture. “When I speak a 
serious subject in an infor­
mal and humorous way, it 
has bigger impact. So 
much so, when BBC made 
a small documentary they 
first thought of having a 
voiceover for me. The 
producer liked my English 
so much (laughs), he said 
they were retaining my original voice.” 
So even in a distant north Indian village, 
Muruganantham will demonstrate the 
working of his machine in English while 
a volunteer will translate it into Hindi. 
“Call it our little revenge against Hindi 
imposition,” he jokes.
So how did the movie happen? Twinkle 
Khanna had called him 18 months ago 
and the padman least knew the persis­
tent lady at the other end happened to be 
late star Rajesh Khanna’s daughter and 
the wife of Akshay. But he found the 
ent ire team—Twinkle, Akshay and direc­
tor R. Balki—as down to earth like him. 
And enamoured of his English as well. 
With Balki, a Tamil, though, Muruga­
nantham could converse in his mother 
tongue while ironing out the details. The 
production team spent weeks at his 
workshop and home studying his life­
style and meeting the women in his life.
“They involved me in every part of the 
project right from the script to the sets 
resembling my factory. Of course I had to 
help in designing the sanitary napkin 
with an artificial uterus filled with blood 
that Akshay Kumar had to wear and ride 
a bicycle. He confessed later it was more 
difficult than some of his stunt scenes as 
he had to ensure it did not break or 
bleed,” Muruganantham says. He is 
confident that the message of PadMan 
and Akshay’s star value would take him 
closer to his ultimate goal: employment 
to ten lakh women, who would make and 
market his low­cost pads. In turn, they 
would bestow hygiene and dignity to 
every Indian woman. O
For Akshay, 
wearing an 
artificial  
uterus while  
riding a cycle 
was tougher 
than any of his 
stunt scenes.

HO, I wonder, is a coward? 
All of Perumal Murugan’s 
poems are not about the 
cow  ard but the tone, melody, 
meaning and the implied in 
this book force us to ref ect 
on that one word. Is the coward a value-
less creature? Is he gutless? Does he 
need to change? Is a coward just some-
one we mock? And the direct question: 
is Perumal Murugan a coward?
As we move from word to word, phrase 
to phrase, poem to poem and travel 
through 2015 and 2016 (the day/month/
year mentioned after every poem), with 
Murugan’s words carrying us through this 
period, the coward emerges as a creative 
spirit. A quiet seeker, much like Murugan’s 
snail. He moves slowly, in silence, at his 
own pace, leaving behind a shadow, a gli­
mmering trail. He lives away from the 
spo tlight, but his is a beautiful mind that 
allows the darkness around him to charge 
his imagination. We try to squash him, 
poke fun at him, ridicule him. In response, 
he just slips back into his shell, and rem­
ains still. And if he is an artist, his canvas, 
melodies, rhythms or words are suffused 
with the voice that we all sought to end. 
Perumal Murugan is such a coward; not 
fearless, but not fearful.
But it is not that simple, is it? We cannot 
romanticise the coward without recognis­
ing his struggles in an aggressive society. 
As Murugan states in The Song of a Coward, 
a coward is of no consequence to society 
or nature since he does not disturb its illu­
sion of an equilibrium. “But a coward does 
think about suicide and does it, too.” This 
is where art becomes essential to a human 
being. A passage for expression of thought, 
ideas, struggles, anguish, despair, happi­
ness, curiosity, understanding. For an 
isolated Perumal Murugan, physically 
away from the violence that he was facing, 
each poetic word was probably a life giver.
Poetry is as abstract as an alapana, aria 
or an impressionistic painting. In its very 
form, it subverts language and meaning 
and creates avant­garde impressions and 
immersions in the semantic and aural 
uni  verse. But this has to be grounded in 
the real, actual and tactile. From this ear­
thy bond, the poet reimagines our world of 
relationships. Perumal Murugan is a 
master of this craft.
Nature lies all around us and we have 
given it multiple attributes, , attitudes and 
emotions. After a while, we seem to forget 
that all that we have bestowed upon nat­
ure is what we see in ourselves. In this 
collection, nature is a dark friend, not 
pleasant, inviting or beauteous. Murugan’s 
mind is heard and seen in life that sur­
rounds him. Whether it is the night, the 
snail, the goat, pig, rat, trees, beetle or 
crow, they all are trapped or abused in 
some manner and powerlessness perme­
ates their condition. The bleeding that he 
starkly describes in the poems comes 
from his unhealed emotional wounds. 
These poems highlight the vulgarity with 
which violence is used in today’s India to 
terrorise writers and artists. His words 
reflect the frame of mind of all those who 
are brutally ambushed by extremists. And 
the publication of these poems allows us 
to view the trauma a writer goes through. 
There is a helplessness in his voice, a 
mou rning; yet he is a fighter, asking why it 
is wrong to think, question and dream. 
There are flashes of relief—even a smile in 
which I can see Murugan’s face—but soon 
he returns to reflection. He also constantly 
introspects on his own inadequacies. To 
hold a mirror to one’s self—even when you 
know that the world has done you wrong—
is special. It is a deeply emotional experi­
ence to witness his aatmavichaarana.
As I have observed before about his short 
stories, Murugan uses odour as a brilliant 
literary mechanism to make the reader 
invest emotionally in the moment. These 
poems are filled with aroma, fragrance, 
stench, effluvium, bouquet and malodor­
ousness. When you read these adjectives 
in context and flow, you enter the spirit of 
the metaphor and experience the pleasure 
or the disgust in his words. Here, Murugan 
pays special attention to human excreta 
and genitalia; both of which are rarely 
written about in the poetic form. The 
treatment of these subjects is wondrous. 
They are not looked upon with repug­
nance. Quite to the contrary, they play a 
role in questioning human perception of 
morality, decency, beauty and pleasure.
Murugan has this knack of upturning 
the ordinary and the special. He gives life 
to so many things that we take for granted 
and don’t even notice. There are a few 
poems on a rented house, vacating a house, 
owning a home, the spade or stray dogs 
that force us to reevaluate the way we view 
life. Murugan seems to be suggesting that 
there is nothing ordinary about life; every 
moment, every being, animate or inani­
mate, is replete with learnings. It is us, 
self­absorbed mortals, who are oblivious 
of this extravaganza, stimuli for human 
imagination. Murugan recalibrates the 
rea der’s comprehension of the self and 
the other and gifts us insights into the 
human condition. Much like a philoso­
pher redrafts our intellectual blueprint.
I have read some of the poems in their 
original Tamil. Aniruddhan Vasude van 
deserves credit for having ret ained the 
directness and unf o rgiving bluntness of 
the original verses. As a friend of Murugan 
and a collaborator, I must say that the 
poems allow us to understand emotions 
that we all feel but are unable to describe 
and reading them is a mind­rinsing expe­
rience. In order to remain true in this 
opp ressive world, the coward in every one 
of us needs Perumal Murugan’s words. O

As usual
I am walking
on the left side of the road 
ruminating 
on the moments I had lost 
when I was dead 
On the memories 
of sorrow trampling on me 
On the wonders 
of the lives of ancestors 
I am walking 
like a goat relishing the shade 
The present and the future 
gently come and go 
like a cradle rocked by the wind 
As usual 
I let out a few sighs 
The police appear 
out of nowhere 
and surround me 
It seems there was a complaint 
that my breath blared 
like a fire truck’s siren 
Could such a wail have emerged 
from a sigh even I couldn’t hear? 
Really? Really? I ask 
They warn me, they threaten me 
Arrest, jail time 
it is all possible, they say 
I express remorse 
I ask for forgiveness 
They let me walk 
but keep watch over me 
Holding my breath in as long as I can 
I reach my room 
I shut all doors and windows 
and risk breathing a little 
I even try sighing 
It sounds like a needle falling 
Perhaps it is too loud 
If the sound of my breathing spills out 
it might bruise someone’s ears 
Reaching in through their ears 
it might wound their hearts 
Be it the past 
the present or 
the future 
from now on 
I shall not sigh over anything 
It might be good if I can hold in 
even my shallow breath 
I shouldn’t hurt anyone 
I learn to breathe

trying not to move even the hair in my

I learn to breathe

IOGRAPHIES of warriors such 
as Alexander, Babur, Napoleon 
make for fascinating reading. 
Sta  ring with modest resources, 
they expanded their jur isdict i­
ons across diverse lands and 
people, leaving permanent legacies. A 
common trait among them was lack of 
fear, and a passion and love for conflict. 
The memoirs of environmental activist 
Sun ita Narain, aptly titled Conflicts of 
Interest: My Journey through India’s 
Green Movement, reads like the acco­
unt of one such warrior. She ventured 
to wage battles against the mighty on 
diverse issues, including air pollution, 
use of pesticides and their impact on 
ground water, climate change and car­
bon emissions, tiger conservation and 
managing water and waste.
Initiated into environmental activism 
at 21 by her employer and mentor Anil 
Aggrawal, Sunita took on his mantle after 
his premature demise. She brought to 
their agenda and work fearlessness and 
agression that eventually brought her 
org a nisation, Centre for Science and 
Environment (CSE), to the public policy 
mainstream. Sunita (and CSE) picked 
her battles well—issues that impacted 
com mon people. She took on the mighty: 
auto leaders like Bajaj and Tatas on air 
quality; Coke and Pepsi on pesticide resi­
dues in ground water; developed coun­
tries on climate change; conservationists 
and luxury resorts on tiger conservation 
and government agencies on water and 
waste management. She is unsparing of 
celebrities too, including superstars who 
advertised on behalf of cola giants. She 
uses Al Gore’s terminology, ‘inconvenient 
truth’, repeatedly in the chapter on clim­
ate change to mock the US’ double stan­
dards in climate change negotiations.
In each case, she also took on what she 
calls ‘established science’, opposing 
leading opinions within the scientific 
community. This led to her research  
met hodologies, competence, even her 
moti ves being questioned. However, env ­
i ronmental activism has in recent years 
found a great ally in the judiciary and that 
is how Sunita won many a battle.
Though not focussed like others on 
mobilising public movements, each battle 
was waged for the weak and the voi celess, 
like unsuspecting urban reside nts brea­
thing toxic air, aerated drinks with low 
quality standards, dev eloping countries 
unfairly treated on climate cha nge talks, 
communities alienated from their eco­
systems by Pro ject Tiger and traditional 
water harvesting practices.
The book is a lucid, detailed account of 
these battles from inside the ring. Sunita 
explains how she got drawn to each issue, 
how established beliefs and vested inter­
ests were challenged and the ensuing tri­
b ulations of the long­drawn struggle for 
change. Not all the battles were won and 
even where points were scored and deba­
tes won, desired outcomes have not fully 
fructified. But, undoubtedly, Sunita and 
CSE have been and are significant stake­
holders in the environment space. They 
are taken seriously in India and abroad.
The book is a must read for both the lay 
reader interested in our environmental 
concerns and those actively involved in 
public policy and research on environm­
ent. Many of us from the latter space have 
not always agreed with Sunita’s views and 
her overt agression, but have always been 
in awe of her courage and exemplary lea­
dership in building up a non­goverment 
institution without significant governm­
ent/corporate support. From this ari ses 
her independent streak and ability to call 
a spade a spade. Obs essive warrior that 
she is, Sunita’s memoirs do not adequately 
capture the con c urrent contributions of 
other individuals and institutions in tak­
ing forward the environment agenda. I 
guess in the ring, with the lights and 
media glare, you can barely see others. 
Aware that a book on environmental 
iss  ues could easily be a drab reference 
book, Sunita includes interesting, drama­
tic anecdotes. The most interesting cha­
pter is the one on cola wars, perhaps the 
most contentious of her battles. The det­
ails relating to her experience with the 
parliamentary committee are almost hil ­
a rious and surprisingly, she gets a major 
vindication there. It also became one of 
the factors leading to the present food 
safety and standards framework. The 
chapter on climate change exposes how 
the US is leading the developed world in 
imposing unfair rest rictions on energy 
consumption in developing countries.
The last chapter attempts at outlining a 
blueprint for the future. Inadequate adv­
ancement in technology and poor ins titu­
tional framework for implementing 
age ncies and regulatory bodies are seen as 
factors responsible for our failure to res­
olve 
our 
environmental 
problems. 
Informed people will agree. An interesting 
perspective is that the likes of Uber and 
Airbnb could be a highly positive disrup­
tion for the environment through opti­
mum use of existing resources. O

A 
LISSOM girl with beech tree 
limbs flows in and out of time 
frames, remote and mysterious 
and beautiful as a tree in the 
sunlight is. She is glimpsed 
here, seen there and gone with­
out explanation. The Nine-Cham be red 
Heart is Pariat’s balancing act, a Ra-
shomon viewpoint from those who 
surround her heroine through frag­
mented ways of seeing that together 
create some collective truth.
An anonymous group of people, one by 
one, charts the growth of a girl to woman, 
from a city without a river to a city with 
a river across two continents. There are 
not even nine people—there are eight of 
them with labels like The Saint, The 
Lighthouse Keeper, The Caretaker, The 
Florist, titles which evolve from some 
aspect of their lives in relation to the 
woman. The Butcher has two sections 
dev oted to his appearances and disap­
pearances, and he does in some sense 
hack through the woman’s heart. Some 
kinds of literary erotica use names like 
these for their protagonists, so do alle­
gories—though given the sexuality in 
the book, perhaps erotica would be a 
better comparison.
There are never any names of the type 
we know mentioned in this delicate 
balancing act of anonymity; it glides 
over second and third persons. No one 
calls each other anything even in the 
most intimate moments, except for a 
sudden ‘habibi’ from the only other 
woman in the story.
If you flip through the pages, it some­
times seems like a guessing game, be­
cause the lack of names and sense of 
places leave you disorientated. The 
chapters flow through corridors and 
deserted apartments with sudden 
blocks of colour, a pink and green ca­
thedral, the green eyes of a cat, a red 
and black painting of tiger crouching 
like love. One half recognises places, 
retreats and walks down corridors, 
catching fleeting glimpses of those one 
half knew. You know the city with a 
river is London, because of the Pound 
(currency) and because the name comes 
in later. For the rest—she comes from a 
small town in the east of her home 
country, which again remains nameless, 
though we guess, again, that it is in 
India. It may even be in the hills of 
Meghalaya, like Pariat’s. There are no 
giveaway words, no telltale details, of 
artefacts or clothes.
What the men look like we never know 
and as for her, we see her through the 
eyes of others, sometimes filling the 
canvas, sometimes shrinking. Once she 
is marked by her knobby knees and once 
by her coltish gawky legs, though these 
are terms of endearment from a woman 
who has lost her lover and is unsure of 
sexual certainties.
Anonymity allows the book to be com­
prehensible, no matter where in the 
world the reader happens to be based. 
Which is presumably why Pariat chose 
this approach. Certain things repeat 
themselves, like the cats, two of which 
are sick in two different episodes, and in 
one of them the girl flits away like a cat 
herself once the felines are gone. The 
more things change the more they seem 
the same—a girl who reads Bonjour 
Tristesse would agree with that.
Pariat draws out the girl’s coming of 
age as she changes from a reserved 
schoolgirl unwilling to commit herself 
to art or be part of the drawing class who 
discovers her metier for origami 
through the gentle understanding of an 
art teacher to a polished writer whose 
lifestyle takes her through relationships. 
Som e where, she who has no name reg­
rets that she cannot do a personal thing 
like write a novel instead of archiving 
work for a publishing house. Then, from 
being an awkwardly beautiful outsider 
she suddenly fits almost too neatly into 
the streamlined world of international 
educational agencies with publishing 
divisions that allow her to flit between 
continents and piece together a mar­
riage which is there and gone in a chap­
ter. For an edgy girl who confesses losing 
her virginity to a stool at the age of nine, 
this appears slightly too conventional.
The Nine-Chambered Heart is evoca­
tively written—that goes without say­
ing—but it leaves questions that linger. 
The girl has parents; the woman is in 
contact with them and even stays with 
them along with her brief lighthouse 
keeper husband, but why they left her 
with her grandparents when she was in 
school remains a mystery. No dark sec­
ret comes to light. What was the wish 
she made by stringing up the thousand 
origami cranes? If it was to become a 
writer in a city without a river, that ulti­
mately seems far too little for a world 
that has witnessed the scattered lives 
and relationships of too many writers. O
One Thousand Paper Cranes
In this evocatively written tale of a girl growing up, concrete reality slips 
out of reach, yet is all the more believable, leaving some lingering questions

IS THERE GENDER 
EQUALITY IN SPORTS?
W
hen women were 
first permitted to 
enter the Olympic 
Games 
in 
1900, 
they 
represented 
just 22 of 997 — or 2.2 percent — 
of the athletic competitors. They had 
only five sports to compete in: tennis, 
sailing, croquet, equestrian, and golf 
— while men had 19. 
In the Rio 2016 Olympics, 45 
percent of all competitors were 
women.. There were  4,700 women 
competitors of 10,444 total athletes, 
with a record setting 28 women 
sports. This is, in part, a result of 
increased efforts by the IOC and 
other advocacy groups to lobby for 
more women’s sports.
The above equation certainly makes 
it seem like women have broken 
the glass ceiling and transgressed 
all barriers and boundaries, and are 
rubbing shoulders with their male 
counterparts on the sporting field, 
with perhaps the only difference 
lying in the testosterone levels 
between male and female, thereby 
compelling them to compete in 
separate categories.
Kanthi

who 
has 
anchored 
the 
Olympics, 
Asian 
factors that contribute to the higher 
incidence of injuries among female 
athletes which include different 
hormonal level, muscle-fat ratio, and 
the inherent bone structure.
As per Kanthi, there just isn’t 
enough media coverage for injuries 
in female athletes. Female athletes in 
general deserve the same amount of 
media coverage as men, but because 
they are passed off as trivial or less 
skilled, the serious injuries they endure 
are passed over as well. Until there is 
equal respect for male/female sports, 
there won’t be the same respect for 
resulting health risks. There needs 
to be better research available on 
the full-scale risks of female athletic 
injuries and more expansive range 
of studies conducted on the subject, 
she says.
There are a variety of reasons for 
this “gender gap,” and there is much 
about it that remains uncertain. 
But the recognition of this gap is 
important to innovate efforts to 
bridge it.
Ms. Kanthi D Suresh
Games & Commonwealth games for 
India says that one needs to clearly 
distinguish between gender equality 
and gender parity. Gender parity, 
is used to measure gender balance 
in a given situation, and can aid in 
achieving gender equality but is not 
the goal in itself. Gender equality, on 
the other hand,  is more than just 
equal representation, and is strongly 
tied to ‘rights’. It entails the concept 
that all human beings, both men 
and women, are free to develop 
their personal abilities and make 
choices without the limitations set by 
stereotypes, rigid gender roles and 
prejudices. While number of women 
participating in sporting competitions 
may be increasing, with new rules 
bringing in more sporting events for 
women, Kanthi feels that this does 
not necessarily translate into sexual 
equality which is determined by an  
equal ease of access to resources and 
opportunities regardless of gender, 
including economic participation and 
decision-making
She further adds that though 
Female athletes have come a long 
way since the first modern Olympics 
in 1896, but in terms of health 
coverage and attention, there is still 
progress to be made.
Today, the most common form 
of injury that women endure at 
a disproportionate rate to men is 
Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) 
injury where Women are six times 
more likely to injure their ACL than 
men. The five most common injuries 
among female athletes are ankle 
sprains, shoulder issues, knee injuries 
(including 
ACL 
injuries),

fasciitis, and stress fractures

The Demonstrative Crime
It boggles the mind to think it’s almost 40 
years now. But why is it not surprising to 
realise that the issues have not changed 
one bit? Should an aberration, an 
abnormality, a wrong, be allowed to exist 
unreported? Is it more intolerable that a 
crime is committed, every minute, silently, 
or that it is reported? Which is worse? That 
a grievous flaw exists? Or that it is demon­
strated to exist, so that something can be done about it? The 
UIDAI filing an FIR against The Tribune journalist Rachna 
Khaira, for a story that exposed how easy it is to buy your 
Aadhaar biometric data, brought back memories. Should a 
journalist push the envelope by participating in a crime to 
show it exists? My answer, after all these years, is still yes.
The day my Kamla story appeared in The Indian Express in 
1981, the first phone call I received was from a police officer. 
Not to tell me that the government had registered a criminal 
case against me. It was a phone call to compliment me for 
the expose. Now, after more than 35 years, I have no qualms 
about revealing the name of that officer. He was K.K. Paul, an 
IPS officer, currently governor of Uttarakhand.
What They Don’t Teach You…
…in a journalism course. It’s probably best to recap the 
whole thing for the benefit of younger readers. Essentially, 
this used to happen in parts of central India, and pat­
ronage from police and politicians was a no­brainer. 
People would buy women. Like buying a new pair of shoes 
with the change of season. The question was how to bring 
this practice to the light of day. We discussed it from all 
angles: the consensus was that simply reporting it would 
serve no purpose. We decided to go the whole hog, and 
participate in that moral wrong: actually buy a woman. 
Quod erat demonstrandum.
I Got Anticipatory Bail
It took me almost a year to penetrate the racket. 
It was an area where country­made pistols 
were bought like packs of cigarettes. 
Arun Shourie, my editor, knew the 
project we were embarking upon 
could land us in trouble with the law. 
We worked out a strategy. He wrote 
letters to three prominent persons, 
including the then chief justice of 
India, P.N. Bhagwati, setting out our 
intentions behind participating in 
that crime of purchasing a woman. 
In sealed envelopes, along with 
covering notes requesting them not 
to open the letters until they were 
requested to do so. 
I ‘bought’ Kamla, a girl 
from the Morena­Agra­Dholpur area—the 
trijunction of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh 
and UP. I had put up at the circuit house 
in Morena district headquarters. Asif 
Ibrahim, who was to become the IB 
chief in 2013­14, was chief of the Morena 
district police at that time. Morena is one 
end of the dreaded Chambal ravines, and 
Ibrahim had known to have taken down 
a few daakus those days. Trafficking of 
young girls was rampant in those parts. A story on the issue 
needed to have a bit of shock value, we reckoned. Maybe our 
guess was right. Forty years later, the story survives. With 
even a film based on it: Marc Zuber played my character and 
Deepti Naval essayed the timid Kamla.
Shoot the Messenger
Was our little moral transgression—meant to shine a 
torch right into the dark—read right? Were the Congress 
governments at the Centre and in Madhya Pradesh alive to 
this journalistic intervention? Well, they did act swiftly. The 
Madhya Pradesh police registered a criminal case against 
me under all kinds of sections of the trafficking act. I had 
my friends too. A well­meaning T.R. Kakkar, who later 
became Delhi police commissioner, tipped me off about MP 
cops in his office. They’d sought the help of Delhi Police to 
arrest me. Kakkar thought otherwise. In his judgement, my 
expose was not a criminal act because the intention was to 
expose a horrific crime in our society. Shourie rushed to the 
Supreme Court and we got a stay against any arrest. Later, 
as the Supreme Court directed, the government ordered 
an inquiry by three states that confirmed the existence 
of large­scale trafficking. In raw words, the sale­purchase 
of women in what was a catchment area for big brothel 
bazaars of India’s big metros.
First Draft, History, All That
As I reflect on the Kamla story in the light of whatever’s 
happening in society and media now, a few things come to 
mind. One of them being the tendency to offer news 
stories as instant consumables—some sort of fast 
food for the mind. This is a way of doing journal­
ism, of thinking about what we in the media 
do, that does not realise the lasting impact it 
has on our system. Journalists sometimes 
have to show society its own ugly face in the 
mirror. I say we need more Rachna Khairas. 
(Investigative journalist Sarin controver-
sially ‘bought’ Kamla from a village 
to expose the trafficking racket 
in the Chambal area. Vijay 
Tendulkar wrote a play on the 
episode, titled Kamla, and it 
was made into an acclaimed 
film of the same name.)
