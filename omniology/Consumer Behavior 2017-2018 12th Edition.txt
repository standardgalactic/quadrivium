were 3,977,745 births in the U.S. in 2015, slightly down from the 3,985,924 recorded in
2014 and 8% below the all-time high of 4,316,233 in 2007.  The birth rate in 2014 was
12.5 per 1,000 population.
In 2015, the fertility rate fell to a new all-time low of 62.5 births per 1,000 women
ages 15-to-44.  This is 9% below the rate of 69.3 in 2007 and the lowest since World
War II..  The fertility rates of females ages 15-to-19, 20-to-24, and 25-to-29 all fell to
new record lows in 2015.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Never before have young women had so few
children.  The first-birth rate also hit an all-time
low in 2013, with the rate dropping for women in
every age group under age 30.  Clearly, young
women are reluctant to have children, and the
number of births is essentially unchanged only
because older women are playing catch up
before time runs out.  The seeming stability in
births belies the havoc wreaked by the Great
Recession on the lives of young adults.”

Generational assessments explore how the era in which people live influences
their behavior.  Many consumers who lived through the Great Depression of 1929, for
example, remained frugal their entire lives because of the profound impact it had on
them.  Baby Boomers grew up without psychological scars from the Depression and
generally spend more freely than their parents’ generation.  Subsequent generations
have grown up in an age of abundance, easy credit, and a taste for luxury.  Spending
and lifestyles of Generation Z will likely be influenced by the Great Recession of 
2008-2009.
Spending is also influenced by life cycles.  Most members of Generation X are
now in their peak earning and spending years.  Baby Boomers, some looking toward
retirement or semi-retirement, are beginning to spend less.  
Generational demographics are further assessed in Part XI of this handbook.

2.4  Household Wealth
According to Survey of Consumer Finances, published every three years by the
Federal Reserve (www.federalreserve.gov), median household net wealth, adjusted for
inflation, has been as follows:
•
2007:
$135,400
•
2010:
$  82,800
•
2013:
$  81,200
From 2007 to 2010, median inflation-adjusted net worth (e.g. wealth) fell 38.8%
to $77,300, the same level as in 2001.  This drop is attributed to the Great Recession.  
Median household net worth continued to drift downward between 2010 and
2013, suggesting that most households were not recovering from the recession.  Many
households experienced double-digit declines in net worth between 2010 and 2013,
after adjusting for inflation. 
Following a 39% decline between 2007 and 2010, households headed by people
ages 45-to-54 saw their net worth fall by an additional 17% between 2010 and 2013. 
Household segments headed by people without a high school diploma, with only some
college, and the broad segment “nonwhites or Hispanics” also experienced double-digit
declines in net worth between 2010 and 2013.
Overall, net household wealth, which mostly consists of home equity, stock
portfolios, and other savings, was $81.5 trillion in June 2014, according to the Federal
Reserve.  Household wealth peaked before the recession at $67.4 trillion and reached
a low of $55 trillion (inflation-adjusted) in early 2009, in the depths of the recession.
The distribution of wealth in the United States is as follows:
•
The top 20% of Americans hold 84% of U.S. wealth
•
The second 20% hold 11%
•
The third 20% hold 4%
•
The fourth 20% hold 0.2%
•
The bottom 20% hold 0.1%
Twenty-five percent (25%) of American households have zero or negative net
worth; 37% have a net worth of less than $12,000.

2.5  Poverty And Economic Insecurity
The U.S. poverty rate in 2014 was 14.8%, with 46.7 million people classified as
living in poverty, according to the Census Bureau.  This was an increase from 14.5% in
2013.  The 2013 poverty rate was 2.3 percentage points higher than in 2007, the year
before the Great Recession.
While Census Bureau figures provide an official measure of poverty, they are
only a temporary snapshot and do not capture the makeup of those who cycle in and
out of poverty at different points in their lives.  That snapshot shows that 12.6% of
adults in their prime working-age years of 25-to-60 live in poverty.  But measured in
terms of a person’s lifetime risk, a much higher number – four in 10 adults – fall into
poverty for at least a year of their lives.
According to an assessment by the Associated Press (AP), the risks of falling
into poverty have been increasing in recent decades, particularly among people ages
35-to-55, and coinciding with widening income inequality.  For instance, people ages
35-to-45 had a 17% risk of encountering poverty during the 1969-1989 time period; that
risk increased to 23% during the 1989-2009 period.  For those ages 45-to-55, the risk of
poverty jumped from 12% to 18% over the two periods.
The AP study defines ‘economic insecurity’ as a year or more of periodic
joblessness, reliance on government aid such as food stamps, or income below 150%
of the poverty line.  According to its assessment, the recent high rates of unemployment
mean the lifetime risk of experiencing economic insecurity is 79%.
Poverty and economic insecurity cut across all ethnic and racial demographics. 
More than 19 million whites fall below the poverty line of $23,021 for a family of four,
accounting for more than 41% of the nation’s destitute, nearly double the number of
poor blacks.  Seventy-six percent (76%) of whites will experience economic insecurity
by the time they turn 60.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Hardship is particularly growing among whites,
based on several measures.  Pessimism among
that racial group about their families’ economic
futures has climbed to the highest point since at
least 1987.  While poverty rates for blacks and
Hispanics are nearly three times higher, by
absolute numbers the predominant face of the
poor is white.”

Dynamics Of Economic Well-Being: Poverty, a study by the Census Bureau,
reported that between 2009 and 2012, 31.6% of the U.S. population experienced
poverty for at least two months.  
Among Hispanics, 49.6% experienced poverty, the highest of all ethnic groups. 
By age, the percentage was 40.6% among children, 31.0% among adults ages 18-to-
64, and 15.7% among the elderly.  Among those without a high school diploma, 50.6%
experienced poverty.  Among those with some college education, 22.9% experienced at
least two months of poverty.
The Census Bureau defines ‘near poverty’ as having a family income either
below the poverty level or within 100% to 125% of the poverty level.  In 2012, 61 million
people, or 19.6% of the total U.S. population, were living in or near poverty.  For a
family of four with two adults and two children, this is an income of $29,104 or less.  For
someone who lives alone, it’s an income of $14,931 or less.  As a point of reference, a
minimum-wage-earning, full-time worker has an annual income of $15,080, just above
the near-poverty level.
According to Living in Near Poverty in the United States, a report by the Census
Bureau, between 1966 and 2012, the percentage of Americans who live in or near
poverty has fallen slightly – from 21.0% to 19.7%.  The percentage in poverty increased
from 14.7% to 15.0% during those years, while the percentage near poverty dropped
from 6.3% to 4.7%.  The poor and near-poor population expanded by more than 20
million between 1966 and 2012.

3.2  Mortgage Debt
Mortgage debt accounts for 70% of total consumer debt.  Sixty-six percent (66%)
of adults have mortgages on their homes, according to The Harris Poll
(www.theharrispoll.com).
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that mortgage originations in
Fourth Quarter 2015 were $437 billion.  About 104,000 individuals had a new
foreclosure notation added to their credit reports during the quarter.  
In Fourth Quarter 2015, 2.2% of mortgages were 90 days delinquent.
According to The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), known as
Freddie Mac (www.freddiemac.com), homeowners are shortening the terms of their
mortgages.  Since 2011, over one-third of refinancers paid off a 30-year loan and
switched to a 20- or 15-year loan.  
3.3  Credit Card Debt
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, approximately 49% of
households have credit card debt.  Among those with credit card debt, the average was
$15,762 per household at year-end 2015.
Credit card debt at year-end 2015 was $733 billion, an increase from $731 billion
a year prior.
Credit cards are the only type of debt for 22% of U.S. households, according to
the Urban Institute.
Many consumers have given up using credit cards entirely.  According to the
Federal Reserve, 30% of families have no credit cards.
3.4  Student Loans
About two-thirds of bachelor’s degree recipients borrow money to attend college,
either from the government or private lenders, according to the U.S. Department of
Education (www.ed.gov).
Outstanding educational debt has been as follows (source: Federal Reserve):
•

According to Pew Research Center (www.pewresearch.org), 19% of U.S.
households owe student debt, more than double the share two decades earlier and a
rise from the 15% that owed such debt in 2007, just prior to the onset of the Great
Recession.  Forty percent (40%) of households headed by someone younger than age
35 owe such debt.  Among households owing student debt, the average outstanding
balance is $26,682; 10% of student debtor households owe more than $61,894.
    _________________________________________________________________
“While the overall level of student debt may not
measure up to that of mortgages, it is highly
concentrated among a small slice of people –
those in their 20s and 30s – who are the engines
of a great deal of economic activity.  One of the
crucial reasons the housing market has not
expanded enough to support robust economic
growth is that young adults are not setting up
their own households at anywhere near the
historical norm.  Might higher student loan debt
burdens be an important reason?”
                 The New York Times
    _________________________________________________________________
An October 2015 Harris Poll found that 36% of U.S. adults are currently paying
or have paid student debt in the past, a figure unchanged from 2013.  Among these
debtors, 39% say they have put off savings toward retirement, 30% have delayed
buying or leasing a new car, and 30% have delayed buying a home.
3.5  Medical Debt

people are paying off medical debt; an additional 27 million people report problems
paying their medical bills.

In 2015, 26% of adults ages 18-to-64 had problems paying medical bills,
according to the Kaiser Family Foundation (www.kff.org).  Among those with and
without health insurance, these figures are 20% and 53%, respectively.
Hospitals write off about $25 billion, or 2.7% of revenue, as a result of consumer
bad debt, according to the American Hospital Association (www.aha.org).

HOUSEHOLDS & HOUSING
4.1  Households
The Current Population Survey, by the Census Bureau (www.census.gov),
estimated there were 124.6 million households in the U.S. at year-end 2015. 
Distribution by race and ethnicity is as follows:
•
Non-Hispanic white:
67.6%
•
Black:
13.8%
•
Hispanic:
13.0%
•
Asian:
  5.1%
Distribution by type of household is as follows:
•
Family households, married couple:
48.3%
•
Non-family households (a person living alone,
unrelated people living together, or people
in group settings):
33.8%
•
Family households, husband or wife only present:
17.9%
Household composition has undergone significant shifts in recent decades. 
Distributions since 1970 have been as follows:
       
                                        1970         1980          1990         2000         2010

According to the Current Population Survey, households grew an average of
about 500,000 per year from 2007 through 2014.  This is less than half the annual pace
of 1.2 million averaged 2000 through 2007, and lower than that averaged in the 1990s,
when Generation X matured to become heads of households. 
Between 2014 and 2015, the household count increased by 656,000.  The
change in number of households by age of householder is as follows:
•
Under age 25:
-282,000
•
25-to-34:
   87,000
•
35-to-44:
  -43,000
•

    _________________________________________________________________
“The decline in households headed by people
ages 35-to-54 is due to the small Generation X
population moving into those age groups.  The
increase in households headed by people aged
55 or older is due to the large Baby-Boom
generation in those age groups.”
         Memo Demo, 10/17/15
    _________________________________________________________________
Growth in the number of households headed by 25-to-34-year-olds had been
declining since the end of the Great Recession, although the trend reversed slightly in
2015.  The annual change in the number of these households has been as follows:
•
2010-2011:
315,000
•
2011-2012:
274,000
•
2012-2013:
171,000
•
2013-2014:
   -9,000
•
2014-2015:
  87,000
The 25-to-34-year-old population is growing by more than half a million a year. 
But burdened by student debt, challenges in finding well-paying jobs, and rising rents,
few in this age group can afford to live alone or head households.
4.2  Shared Households
The Census Bureau defines shared households as those with a household
member ages 18 or older who is not in school nor the head householder, spouse, or
cohabiting partner.
In 2014, there were 23.5 million shared households (19.1% of all households);
74 million adults (30.9% of all adults) lived in these households, according to the
Census Bureau.  This is a sharp increase from 2007, when there were 19.7 million
shared households (17.0% of all households) housing 62 million adults (27.7% of all
adults).  In 1980, 12.1% of households were shared households.
Among shared households, the majority are multigenerational households, with
adult children living with a parent or grandparent, or an elderly parent living with their
adult children.  According to The Return of the Multi-Generational Family Household, 
a report by the Social & Demographic Trends Project at Pew Research Center
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  41  •

(www.pewsocialtrends.com), 16% of family households are multigenerational.
Young adults ages 25-to-34 are a major component of the growth in the shared-
living population, especially since 2010.  In 2014, 10.7 million adults in this age group
were in a multigenerational household.  This represents 25.2% of all 25-to-34 year olds. 
For comparison, 18.7% and 11.0% of 25-to-34 year olds lived in a multigenerational
home in 2007 and 1980, respectively.  In 2014 alone, 1.8 million young adults moved
into a parent’s home. 
Stephanie Coontz, Ph.D., a family history professor at Evergreen State College,
points out that there are a host of factors prompting families to combine expenses. 
Among them are higher housing costs and the struggling economy.  Also, shared
households are common among the country’s growing number of immigrant families.
According to Amy Gover, a multigenerational issues expert at AARP
(www.aarp.org), the most common multigenerational household is one with a
grandparent as head of household with adult children that have moved in with 
their children, an arrangement usually spurred by the needs of one or both to 
combine resources and save money.  The second most common arrangement is
a grandparent moving in with an adult child’s family, usually for caregiving reasons.
Roommates also account for an increasing number of shared households. 
Census 2010 reported 6.2 million households with non-relatives, including unmarried
partners and roommates, an 8% increase from 2000.
4.3  Home Ownership vs. Renting

The median sales price of new single-family homes sold was $296,400 in 2015;
the average sales price was $360,600.
4.6  Housing Affordability
The traditional affordability standard suggests that housing costs should be no
more than 30% of household income.  According to State of the Nation’s Housing 2016,
by the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University (JCHS,
www.jchs.harvard.edu), the share of cost-burdened households (i.e., households
exceeding the affordability standard) is at 35.3%, down from a record 37.2% in 2010.  
A full 28% of households are paying more than half their incomes for housing. 
4.7  Vacation Homes
According to data by the U.S. Census Bureau, there are 5.33 million vacation,
seasonal, or recreational homes in the United States.  This represents 4.0% of the total
U.S. housing stock.  The following states have the highest concentration of vacation
homes:

median vacation home price in 2015 was $192,000, a 28% increase.
Vacation-home sales accounted for 16% of real estate sales transactions in
2015.
4.8  Home Improvement
New homeowners are the most “home-improvement happy.”  According to
JCHS, even though they represent only 13% of all homeowners, they typically account
for 25% of home improvement spending.  With home sales in decline, the home
improvement market suffered during the economic downturn.
Home improvement spending has been on the rise since 2011.  The Home

COMMUNITIES
5.1  Where People Live
Metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, or metro and micro areas, are
geographic entities defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget
(www.omb.gov) for use by federal statistical agencies in collecting, tabulating, and
publishing federal statistics.  A metro area contains a core urban area population of
50,000 or more.  A micro area contains a core urban area population of at least 10,000
but less than 50,000.  Census 2010 reported the population distribution by  core statistical
area as follows:
•
Metropolitan Statistical Area:
83.7%
•
Micropolitan Statistical Area:
10.0%
•
Outside core area:
  6.3%
According to Current Population Survey, by the U.S. Census Bureau
(www.census.gov), households are distributed by type of community as follows:
•
Inside principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas:
39.47 million (33% of total)
•
Outside principal cities of Metropolitan Statistical Areas:
59.79 million (50%)
•
Outside Metropolitan Statistical Areas:
19.42 million (16%)
There are 19,508 cities; they comprise 3.5% of land area in the U.S.  Population
Trends In Incorporated Areas, published in 2015 by the Census Bureau, reported that
62.7% of the U.S. population lives in a city.
5.2  Population Growth Trends
According to City and Town Totals, published in 2015 by the Census Bureau, the
population of the nation's 749 largest cities (incorporated places with populations of
50,000 or more) increased 4.3% between 2010 and 2014 while the remainder of the
United States grew by 2.4%.  
Population growth between 2010-2014 by city size was as follows:

Among non-metropolitan areas of the U.S., two-thirds lost population between
2010 and 2014, according to a June 2015 report by the USDA's Economic Research
Service (www.ers.usda.gov).  A total of 1,310 non-metro counties had a declining
population in the 2010-2014 time period.  Population decline is caused by two factors:
more people moving out than in and the number of deaths exceeding births.  Among the
1,301 shrinking counties, 622 experienced a population decline because of both factors.
Demo Memo (http://demomemo.blogspot.com) assesses that the largest
metropolitan areas, with a population of 1 million or more, grew 4.2% between 2010 and
2014.  Smaller metropolitan areas grew 2.7%.  Non-metropolitan counties as a whole lost
0.2% of their population during those years.
5.3  Most Desirable Places To Live
A survey by Pew Research Center’s Social & Demographic Trends Project
(www.pewsocialtrends.org) found that 46% of U.S. adults would rather live in a different
type of community from the one in which they are presently living.  There was no
consensus, however, as to what is the ideal place to live.  Survey participants responded
as follows about their ideal community:
•
Small town:
30%
•
Suburb:
25%
•
City:
23%
•
Rural area:
21%
    _________________________________________________________________
“Most city dwellers think the grass would be
greener in a suburb, small town or rural area. 
But urbanites aren’t alone in feeling mismatched
with their surroundings.  More than four-in-ten
residents of suburbs, small towns and rural areas
also report they would prefer to live in a different
type of community.”
    Social & Demographics Trends Project
    Pew Research Center
    _________________________________________________________________
The following are other findings of the Pew study:
•
By a ratio of more than three-to-one, Americans prefer living where the pace of life
is slow.  A similarly lopsided majority prefer a place where neighbors know each
other well over one where neighbors generally are not acquainted.
•
Over 60% of people prefer to live in a warmer climate.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  48  •

•
About seven-in-10 whites rate their current community as “excellent” or “very good”;
only about half of Hispanics and four-in-10 blacks say the same.  Rural and
suburban residents rate their communities better than do residents of cities and
small towns.
•
People who live in a city – as well as people who wish to live in a city – are more
open than others to the idea of living with neighbors who are of different races. 
They are also more open to living among immigrants. 
•
When it comes to community involvement, there is no difference among those who
live in cities, suburbs, small towns, or rural areas.  About half of the residents in
each place say they are involved in their communities. 
5.4  Satisfaction With Communities
A study by the Urban Land Institute (www.uli.org) assessed Americans’
satisfaction with their communities, housing, and transportation and what they want for
themselves and their families.  The study was based on a survey of homeowners by
Belden Russonello Strategists (www.brspoll.com).  The following is a summary of the
Urban Land Institute assessment:
Quality of Life
•
Ninety percent (90%) of American adults are satisfied with their community’s quality
of life, and few worry that these communities are in danger of deteriorating.  Groups
who are least satisfied with where they currently live, such as Latinos and big-city
residents, tend to be the ones who are the most optimistic and who think their
communities are on the upswing. 
Community
•
About a third of the American public live in what they consider small towns, a third in
middle-sized or big cities, 21% in suburbs, and 15% in rural areas.  If given a choice,
a quarter say they would like to be living in rural communities. 
Satisfaction With Residence
•
Be it single-family houses, apartments, or other structures, most adults like where
they live.  Nine in 10 adults report satisfaction with their current dwelling, and four in
five are happy with the range of housing choices in their communities.  Even among
pockets of less contentment with housing, for example among Millennial adults
(ages 18-to-34), Latinos, and big-city residents, dissatisfaction does not rise to high
levels.
Home Ownership
•
Seven in 10 believe that buying a home is a good investment for them, even in the
aftermath of the housing and mortgage difficulties of the last few years.  Two-thirds
of survey respondents said they own their home and seven in 10 renters are hopeful
that within five years they will join the ranks of home ownership. 
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  49  •

Single-Family Homes
•
Two-thirds of the survey participants say they live in detached single-family homes
and the remainder live in apartments, duplexes, row houses, and manufactured
homes.  Among those who believe they will move in the next five years, the appeal
of the single-family home is strong, with two-thirds expecting to move into or remain
in a detached single-family home. 
Mixed-Use Development
•
Two groups have high interest in mixed-use development:
-
Young people and college graduates who are most enthusiastic about living in
centers with shops and offices nearby.
-
Lower-income groups who would like to live in areas with more variety in housing
type and economic diversity.
•
Both of these groups share an interest in living close to where they work or go to
school.  They prefer to live in areas with public transit and would choose shorter
commutes with smaller homes over longer commutes and bigger houses.  
The Appeal of Compact Development
•
While much of the public expresses a desire for single-family homes and rural and
small town life, there are competing pressures and needs that make compact
development more attractive.  Proximity to jobs, schools, and medical services, as
well as a community’s walkability, are powerful draws for many Americans.
Commuting and Driving 
•
Most Americans travel by car, truck, or motorcycle nearly every day, and when the
two-thirds who commute regularly go to their jobs or school 85% travel in a car. 
•
Travel times to work or school divide in relative thirds: fewer than fifteen minutes,
fifteen minutes to half an hour, and over half an hour.  Rural and suburban residents
and African Americans have the longest commutes; about half need thirty minutes
or more to travel to their job or school.
Public Transportation
•
Overall, one in 10 commuters use public transit to get to school or work.  Reliance
on buses and trains is highest among people of color and, naturally, residents of
urban areas.  The public that is served by buses and trains say the quality of their
public transit systems is satisfactory; however, half of those who do not have access
to trains and buses are discontent with the lack of public transportation.
Walkability
•
Americans place high priority on having communities that are walkable, and most
are already at least somewhat content with this aspect of their own communities:
70% say their local sidewalks and crosswalks are satisfactory.  One in five walk to a
destination most days, and almost one-half do so at least once a week.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018

Job Market Dissatisfaction
•
One area of some discontent with community life is the number and quality of job
and career opportunities.  More than two in five say this situation in their community
is unsatisfactory.  This is a problem most acutely felt by people of color and rural
residents and, to a smaller degree, Millennials and Baby Boomers.
Migration
•
Almost one-third of survey respondents said they moved to a different home in the
last five years.  The highest percentages of those who moved were young people,
residents of large cities, and lower-income households.  Most of those who moved
did so because they sought larger homes.  Two in five households anticipate moving
within the next five years.  Among Baby Boomers (ages 48-to-66), Caucasians, and
Midwesterners anticipating a move, the majority say they would prefer moving to a
rural location.  Most Generation Yers, people of color, Westerners, and singles
expressed an interest in urban living.
5.5  Generational Preferences
As Americans age and their incomes rise and then fall, their housing and
community preferences vary. 
Millennials (ages 18-to-34), half of whom are people of color, show the strongest
preference for mixed-use communities.  Most currently have an urban, apartment-living
lifestyle.  At the same time, Millennials are among the least satisfied with where they
live and the most likely to be anticipating moving.  They want walkable communities and
use public transit more than others, although they are still very car dependent.  
Many Generation Xers are in the child-rearing life stage and prefer single-family
home ownership.  While many members of Generation X are anticipating moving, they
are not likely to be looking for mixed-use communities, nor to push for mass transit. 
This group has the largest percentages of high-income members, and if they move they
will be seeking to buy single-family homes.  
Baby Boomers, the middle ground on housing and transportation preferences
and behaviors, live in a wide range of cities and towns.  They are not as likely to move,
but if they do Boomers will seek out smaller homes and shorter commutes.  This cohort,
as it eases into retirement, would like to be close to parks and apart from neighbors.
Seniors are the most likely to stay in their current homes.  These older adults,
who are mainly out of the workforce, are especially likely to want to be in walkable
neighborhoods and close to health services, family and friends, and shopping and
entertainment.

URBAN & RURAL POPULATIONS
6.1  Overview
The U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov) identifies two types of urban areas,
as follows:
•
Urbanized Areas (UAs) of 50,000 or more people;
•
Urban Clusters (UCs) of at least 2,500 and less than 50,000 people.
“Rural” encompasses all population, housing, and territory not included within an
urban area.

Census 2010 counted the U.S. population as follows:
•
Urbanized Areas:
219,922,123

6.3  Suburbs And Exburbs
Suburban areas are outlying single-family housing areas that are surround larger
cities and metropolitan areas.  Typically, they don’t have a system of politics; however,
some do have medical services and smaller shopping areas.
The areas on the periphery of metropolitan areas, dubbed “exburbs,” have been
the fastest growing in recent years.  While growth subsided in exburbs in the wake of
the Great Recession, recent studies show that population migration to these areas has
resumed.

    _________________________________________________________________
“During the housing bubble, Americans moved in
droves to the exurbs, to newly paved subdivisions
on what was once rural land.  Far-out suburbs had
some of the fastest population growth in the country
in the early 2000s, fueled by cheap housing and easy
mortgages.  And these places helped redefine how
we think about metropolitan areas like Washington,
pushing their edges farther and farther from the
traditional downtown.  In the wake of the housing
crash, these same places took the biggest hit. 
Population growth in the exurbs stalled.  They
produced a new American phenomenon: the ghost
subdivision of developments abandoned during the
housing collapse.”
   The Washington Post, 3/26/15
    _________________________________________________________________
A 2015 study by Brookings Institution (www.brookings.edu) found that for the 
first time since 2010 exurban counties were growing faster than inner urban core
counties nationally.  These locations, like Waller County in suburban Houston, Barrow
County in suburban Atlanta, and Johnston County in suburban Raleigh, lie on the
peripheries of large urban areas.
Recent suburbs accounted for roughly 43% of all U.S. residences in 2010. 
Between July 2013 and July 2014, core urban communities lost a net 363,000 people
overall, according to Brookings, as migration increased to suburban and exurban
counties.  The biggest growth was in exurban areas.  The reason is that more than 80%
of employment growth from 2007 to 2013 was in the newer suburbs and exurbs. 
Between 2012 and 2015, as the economy improved, occupied suburban office space
rose from 75% of the market to 76.7%, according to the real estate consultancy Costar
(www.costar.com).
Potentially, the greatest source of exurban and peripheral revival lies with the
maturation of the Millennial generation.  According to demographer Wendell Cox at 
Demographia (www.demographia.com), roughly 90% of communities’ population growth
that can be attributed to Millennials since 2000 has taken place outside of  the urban
core.
According to a 2015 report by the Census Bureau, 529,000 Americans ages 
25-to-29 moved from cities out to the suburbs in 2014, while 426,000 moved in the
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018

other direction.  Among Millennials ages 24 and younger, 721,000 moved out of the
city, compared with 554,000 who moved in.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Exurbia is turning into something very different
from the homogeneous and boring places
portrayed in media accounts.  For one thing
exurbs are becoming increasingly ethnically
diverse.”
       Forbes, 11/3/15
    _________________________________________________________________
In the decade that ended in 2010 the percentage of suburbanites living in
“traditional” largely white suburbs fell from 51% to 39%.  According to a study by the
University of Minnesota School of Law, 44% of residents in the 50 largest U.S.
metropolitan areas now live in racially and ethnically diverse suburbs, defined as
between 20% and 60% non-white.

POPULATION MIGRATION
8.1  Overview
According to the U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov), 36.7 million Americans
moved in 2015.  
About 5 million people, or 1.5% of the population, move to another state each
year.  These moves, which are typically job- or retirement-related, shift where billions of
dollars are spent annually.  Keeping abreast of population shifts can help businesses
with expansion strategies.  
8.2  Migration Trends
The rate of population migration, already in decline over several years, saw an
even greater decline during the recession.  According to the Census Bureau, the
nation’s mobility rates during the Great Recession were among the lowest since World 
War II. 
The Census Bureau began tracking migration when the annual mover rate was
20.2%.  Over time, the mover rate gradually declined.  Rates hovered around 16% in
the late 1990s and fell to around 14% by the early 2000s.
According to Geographical Mobility, a report by the Census Bureau, the mobility
rate (i.e., percentage of people who moved) has been as follows:
•
2006-2007:
13.2%
•
2007-2008:
11.9%
•

According to the Census Bureau, 21 states and the District of Columbia had
positive net domestic migration rates between 2014 and 2015.  The following states
had the highest rates of net domestic migration:

•
19-to-36:
20.4%
•
37-to-48:

    _________________________________________________________________
“Mobility for young adults has fallen to the lowest
level in more than 50 years as cash-strapped 20-
somethings shun home-buying and refrain from
major moves in a weak job market.  Burdened with
college debt or toiling in low-wage jobs, they are
delaying careers, marriage and having children. 
They are staying put and doubling up with
roommates or living with Mom and Dad, unable to
make long-term plans or commit to buying a home,
let alone pay a mortgage.  Many understood after
the 2007-2009 recession that times would be
tough”

•  63  •

According to The Demand Institute (www.demandinstitute.org), 40% of Americans ages
50-to-64 typically plan to move within five years of their retirement.
Consistent with the trend among the overall population, retirees are relocating
less than in the past.  According to the Census Bureau, among the nation’s 74 million
Baby Boomers, about 4 million move each year.  Among those who move, 61% remain
in the same county; only 15% move to another state.  Only about 3.5% of Seniors (ages
70 and older) relocate each year.
   _________________________________________________________________
“Many empty-nesters nowadays, unlike in the
past, have opted not to pull up stakes and move
to sunnier climes like Florida or Arizona.  They
want to continue to live near family and longtime
friends.  Others stay put because of the shaky
economy or the difficulty of selling a home or
getting a mortgage.  Staying put dovetails with
another big trend: the growing number of retirees
continuing to do some paid part-time work.”

8.5  Metropolitan Relocation

“At the peak of the housing bubble in 2006,
almost half a million people fled the country’s 50
largest metro areas in search of less expensive
places to live, many settling in distant suburbs. 
Then the recession put the brakes on all kinds of
migration.  Census data reveal that as Americans
start moving around again, cities are seeing a
different kind of urban flight.  This time,
hundreds of thousands of Americans who enjoy
city living are abandoning major population
centers not for suburbs but for more affordable,
second-tier metropolitan areas.”

being of U.S. households as follows:
•
Sixty-nine percent (69%) of adults report that they are either “living comfortably” or
“doing okay,” compared to 65% in 2014 and 62% in 2013.  However, 31%, or
approximately 76 million adults, are either “struggling to get by” or are “just getting

According to a study by economist Angus Deaton, Ph.D., and Nobel Laureate
Daniel Kahneman, Ph.D., at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public Affairs, Princeton
University (http://wws.princeton.edu), income increases happiness only for those with
annual incomes below $75,000.  The lower a person’s annual income falls below that
benchmark, the unhappier he or she feels.  But no matter how much above $75,000
people earn, they don’t report any greater degree of happiness.
Researchers at Brookings Institution (www.brookings.org) have found a
correlation between age and happiness.  Happiness in most adults tends to diminish
until age 50 or 55, then increases with age.

occur until well into the seventh decade.”

9.7  Weight Control and Dieting
According to the CDC, 27% of adults are obese and an additional 36% are
overweight.  Being overweight increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer,
arthritis, and other health problems.
Rand Corp. (www.rand.org) assessed that 6.6% of U.S. adults are severely
obese, or more than 100 pounds above a healthy weight for their body type. 
Healthcare costs for those severely obese are more than double those of the general
adult population.
A November 2015 poll conducted by Gallup asked adults how they would
describe their personal weight situation.  Responses were as follows:
•
About right:
56%
•
Overweight:
37%
•
Underweight:
  5%
According to Marketdata Enterprises (www.marketdataenterprises.com),
consumers spend $62 billion each year on weight loss and weight control.  Spending
includes health club memberships, diet programs, diet drinks, and prepared foods. 
Annual spending for diet programs such as Jenny Craig, Nutrisystem, and Weight
Watchers is $3.6 billion.
9.8  Exercise And Fitness
According to the CDC, 49% of adults engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate
physical activity five or more days per week or vigorous physical activity for 20 minutes
or more three or more days per week.
Americans who participate in sports, recreation, or exercise spend an average of
1.7 hours daily doing so – one-third of their leisure time is spent on these activities,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov).  But the vast majority of
people are not so engaged in physical activities.  
According to The American Time Use Survey, published by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (www.bls.gov), Americans, on average, spend 18 minutes per day
participating in sports, exercise, or recreation.  On average, teens are active 40 minutes
a day; people ages 35 and above spend 15 minutes or less being active.
Survey of The American Consumer, by GfK MRI (www.gfkmri.com), reported in
2015 that 41% of adults exercise regularly.  This percentage was the same as in the
2002 GfK MRI survey, however the number of adults who exercise at health and fitness
clubs increased to 32% from 23% during that timeframe.
There are approximately 34,460 health and fitness clubs in the U.S., according
to the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association (www.ihrsa.org). 
Combined, they have approximately 54.1 million members.  First Research
(www.firstresearch.com) estimates 2016 spending for memberships and services at 
$25 billion.

9.9  Eating
According to the Consumer Expenditure Survey, by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, American households spend an average of $6,599 annually on food.  The
restaurant share of the food dollar is approximately 40.6%.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Americans spend more at restaurants than they
think they do.  We know this because the
Consumer Expenditure Survey asks respondents
how much they usually spend at restaurants per
week, and it also asks them to keep a daily diary of
their expenditures.  The results are not the same. 
The more precise diary method consistently shows
restaurant spending to be 16% to 22% greater than
the guesstimate.  The opposite happens with
grocery shopping.  When asked how much they
usually spend on groceries per week, households
over-report their spending by about 21% in
comparison with diary data on grocery purchases.”

According to the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS,
www.nationalservice.gov), volunteers contribute about 8.2 billion hours a year.
While the perception may be that volunteers are primarily adults who are active
in their communities or retirees with ample available time, many young adults also give
their time.  According to the CNCS, approximately 3.3 million college students, or 30%
of all students, volunteer each year.  Tutoring and mentoring are the most common
activities.

PERSONAL WELL-BEING
10.1  Overview
Gallup (www.gallup.com) and Healthways (www.healthways.com) have been
tracking personal well-being since 2008.
In 2015, Gallup surveyed 2.3 million adults asking how people feel about and
experience their daily lives.  A Well-Being Index® was computed for each state and
major metropolitan area.
The Well-Being Index provides an assessment of well-being across five
elements, as follows: 
•
Purpose: Liking what you do each day and being motivated to achieve your goals 
•
Social: Having supportive relationships and love in your life 
•
Financial: Managing your economic life to reduce stress and increase security 
•
Community: Liking where you live, feeling safe and having pride in your community 
•
Physical: Having good health and enough energy to get things done daily 
Gallup found that compared with residents of low well-being communities,
residents of high well-being communities have the following attributes:
•
Purpose Well-Being: 12% more likely to learn new and interesting things
•
Social Well-Being: 6% more likely to get positive energy from family and friends
•
Financial Well-Being: 16% less likely to worry about money
•
Community Well-Being: 18% more likely to be proud of their community
•
Physical Well-Being: 25% less likely to have depression over their lifetime
    _________________________________________________________________
“In communities with higher well-being, we
have found that people live longer, happier lives
and businesses and local economies flourish.”

ENTERTAINMENT & LEISURE SPENDING
13.1  Expenditures On Leisure Activities
Richard K. Miller & Associates (RKMA, www.rkma.com) estimates the U.S.
entertainment and leisure market at $2.6 trillion.  For comparison: U.S. retail sales were
$5.3 trillion in 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce; national
healthcare expenditures were $3.2 trillion in 2015, according to the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services.

There is some overlap among the above expenditures.  A few leisure activities
are included in more than one category.  This is somewhat offset by the fact that all
types of leisure expenditures – hobby farming and wellness activities, for example – are
not included in the list.
Based on published statistics by the U.S. government, leisure expenditures are
significantly less than the $2.6 trillion figure assessed here.  According to The Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA, www.bea.gov), Americans spend $745 billion on leisure
pursuits.  This figure is significantly lower because the BEA classifies many leisure
expenditures elsewhere.  Travel and tourism, for example, is considered a separate
category.  Auto customizing and collecting, as another example, are classified as
transportation expenditures.  Collectible purchases, pets, videos, and various other
leisure-related purchases are classified as retail expenditures.

USE OF TIME
14.1  Americans’ Use of Time
The American Time Use Survey (ATUS, www.bls.gov/tus/), first published in
2005 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S. Department of Labor and
updated annually, is the most recognized source for data on use of time.
Use-of-time data is skewed because most people do not participate in all types
of activities.  ATUS accounts for this by quantifying for each type of activity the average
amount of time spent both by all consumers and by only those who participate in an
activity.  
According to the 2015 ATUS, published by the BLS in June 2016, American
adults’ average 24-hour day, the percentage participating in various activities, and the
average time spent among participants are distributed as follows:

LEISURE ACTIVITIES
17.1  Time Spent On Leisure Activities
The American Time Use Survey (ATUS, www.bls.gov/tus/), published June 2016
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the U.S. Department of Labor, assessed
leisure activities as follows:
•
On an average day, 96% of people ages 15 and over engaged in some sort of
leisure activity, such as watching TV, socializing, or exercising.  Of those who
engaged in leisure activities, men spent more time in these activities (5.8 hours)
than did women (5.1 hours).
•
Watching TV was the leisure activity that occupied the most time (2.8 hours per
day), accounting for about half of leisure time, on average, for those ages 15 and
over.  Socializing, such as visiting with friends or attending or hosting social events,
was the next most common leisure activity, accounting for nearly three-quarters of
an hour per day.
•
Men were more likely than women to participate in sports, exercise, or recreation on
any given day – 23% compared with 18%.  Men also spent more time in these
activities than did women – 1.7 hours compared with 1.2 hours.
•
On an average day, adults ages 75 and over spent 7.8 hours engaged in leisure
activities – more than any other age group; 35-to 44 year-olds spent 4.0 hours
engaged in leisure and sports activities – less than other age groups.
•
Time spent reading for personal interest and playing games or using a computer for
leisure varied greatly by age.  Individuals ages 75 and over averaged 1.1 hours of
reading per weekend day and 20 minutes playing games or using a computer for
leisure.  Conversely, individuals ages 15-to-19 read for an average of 8 minutes per
weekend day and spent 1.3 hours playing games or using a computer for leisure. 
•
Employed adults living in households with no children under age 18 engaged in
leisure activities for 4.5 hours per day, 1.1 hour more than employed adults living

The Harris Poll found that the number of leisure hours Americans have returned to
20 hours per week after dipping during the economic downturn.  America’s leisure time
had fluctuated less than one hour annually between 1987 and 2007, consistently
remaining between 19 and 20 hours, but dropped to an all-time low of 16 hours from 2008
through 2011.  Leisure time was 20 hours per week for both men and women in 2013.  
By age, the median time for leisure in 2013 was as follows:
•
18-to-36:
20 hours per week
•
37-to-48:
18 hours per week
•
49-to-67:
21 hours per week
•
68 and older:
30 hours per week
Among those with children in the household, leisure time averaged 15 hours per
week.  Those without children at home enjoyed 25 hours per week of leisure time.

17.5  Leisure Time For Seniors
The American Time Use Survey investigated leisure activities of Seniors, finding
that this group spends their leisure time much differently than Seniors in years past.
    _________________________________________________________________
“While individual retirees are probably as
different as snowflakes, a deep dive into the
demographic statistics of retirement shows that
broader trends are shaping how retirees seek to
enjoy the luxury of time – trends that confirm
some popular assumptions about retirement
while contradicting others.”
                   The New York Times
    _________________________________________________________________
The following is a summary of the ATUS leisure assessment for Seniors:
•
Of the 42 million Americans age 65 or above, 18.7% remain in the labor force, a
sharp increase from 13.9% a decade ago.  Americans over age 65 who were still
employed typically worked 6¼ hours a day.
•
People over 65 devoted 6 hours and 40 minutes a day to socializing, relaxing, and
at leisure – 2 hours and 45 minutes more than those ages 25-to-54.
•
Forty-three percent (43%) of those over 65 read regularly for personal interest,
devoting nearly two hours a day to reading.  In contrast, only 15% of those ages 25
to 54 read regularly for personal interest, devoting about 80 minutes a day.
•
About 20% of Americans over 65 said they participated in sports or performed other
exercise regularly, about 90 minutes each occasion.  Only 1.6% of Americans older
than 65 played golf regularly, devoting 4 hours and 20 minutes on average to the
sport on the days they played.  Slightly more popular is running or walking on a
treadmill or using other cardiovascular equipment – men for 30 minutes on average
and women for 45 minutes. 
•
Almost 90% of older Americans said they regularly watched TV and movies at
home, on average for 4 hours and 40 minutes a day.  That compares with 3 hours
and 10 minutes for Americans ages 25-to-54.  
•
Eleven percent (11%) of those 65 and over said they regularly played non-computer
games, like bridge or Scrabble, averaging 1 hour and 52 minutes of play.

17.6  Vacations
PhoCusWright (www.phocuswright.com), a travel industry research firm, found
that 65% of U.S. adults travel for leisure each year.  The Harris Poll
(www.theharrispoll.com) reported a similar finding, that 66% of U.S. adults plan at least
one leisure summer trip each year. 
Not taking time off burns people out and can wreak havoc on productivity. 
Vacation deprivation is one reason workers are reporting more mistakes, anger, 
and resentment at co-workers, according to the Families & Work Institute
(www.familiesandwork.org), which recently found that those who vacationed
experienced an 82% increase in job performance post-trip.  
The now-popular micro-vacations – taking two or three days off – do not deliver
the same stress-reduction benefits as vacations that last one and two weeks, research
shows.  Experts agree that a key ingredient in peak performance is a drastic change of
scenery, coupled with shutting down for extended periods of time.
Vacations are also about health: At least two studies have correlated the stress-
reducing benefits of annual vacations with lower rates of coronary heart disease.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Research shows that vacations can reduce the
risk of heart disease, depression, and a host of
other ills, and even slow the aging process.”

In 2015, 15.0 million people, or 10.1% of total U.S. workers, were self-employed. 
The self-employment rate – the proportion of total employment made up of self-
employed workers – has trended down over the past two decades.  In 1994, the
self-employment rate was 12.1%.
20.2  Time Spent Working
The American Time Use Survey (ATUS, www.bls.gov/tus/), published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and assessed in Chapter 14 of this handbook,
reported that 44% of adults of all ages worked.  Those who worked spent an average of
8.03 hours per week working or engaged in work-related activities.
ATUS, published in June 2016, provided the following profile of workers:
•
Employed persons worked an average of 7.6 hours on the days they worked. 
•
More hours were worked, on average, on weekdays than on weekend days, 8.0
hours compared with 5.6 hours.
•
Far more people worked on weekdays than on weekend days: 83% of employed
persons worked on an average weekday, compared with 34% on an average
weekend day.
•
On the days they worked, employed men worked 42 minutes more than employed
women.  This difference partly reflects women’s greater likelihood of working part
time.  However, even among full-time workers (those usually working 35 hours or
more per week), men worked longer than women, 8.2 hours compared with 7.8
hours.
•
On the days they worked, 82% of employed persons did some or all of their work at
their workplace, and 24% did some or all of their work at home.  Workers spent
more time working at the workplace than at home, 8.0 hours compared with 3.2
hours.
•
Multiple jobholders were more likely to work on an average day than were single
jobholders, 80% compared with 67%.
•
Multiple jobholders also were more likely to work at home than were single

jobholders, 36% compared with 23%.
•
Self-employed workers were nearly three times more likely than wage and salary
workers to have done some work at home on days worked, 56% compared with
20%. 
•
Self-employed workers also were more likely to work on weekend days than were
wage and salary workers, 43% compared with 31%.
•
On the days they worked, 36% of employed people age 25 and over with a
bachelor’s degree or higher did some work at home, compared with only 7% of
those with less than a high school diploma.

20.4  Workplace Flexibility
A survey by The Harris Poll (www.theharrispoll.com) assessed working adults on
their perceptions and preferences around several work/life and flexibility issues. 
Findings were as follows:
•
Seventy-five percent (75%) of working adults reported having “at least a little”
flexibility at work.
•
Seventy-three percent (73%) of working adults said that flexibility is one of the most
important factors they consider when looking for a new job or deciding what
company to work for.
•
Sixty-eight percent (68%) of working adults agree that their company would be
willing to accommodate them if they requested a flexible work schedule due to
reasons like family care, personal work preferences, health issues, etc.
•
Eighty percent (80%) of working adults agree that flexible work options are just as
important for people who don’t have children as they are for those who do, and
interestingly, there is no significant difference in opinion between women (69%) and
men (66%).
•
When asked if they would be willing to give up a portion of their salary for more
flexibility at work, 45% of working adults said they would be willing to relinquish at
least some portion of their salary.
•
Seventy-three percent (73%) of working adults believe it is possible to “have it all”
when it comes to work/life balance.
•
Thirty-nine percent (39%) of working adults say that they have considered leaving or
have left a job because it wasn’t flexible enough. 
20.5  Working At Home
According to a recent study published in the American Sociological Review,
nearly half of American workers bring work home with them regularly.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 4.2 million adults are home-
workers; about 65% of these people work full-time at home.  Fifty-eight percent (58%)
of stay-at-home-workers run their own business and 35% telecommute, working for
private companies or nonprofits located elsewhere.

21.3  Consumer Use Of CE Products
The 18th Annual Household CE Ownership and Market Potential Study,
published in April 2016 by the CTA, reported the technology devices experiencing the
largest increase in household ownership from 2015 to 2016 include portable wireless
speakers (up 10 percentage points to reach 35% household ownership); wearable
fitness activity trackers (up 9 percentage points to 20% ownership); wireless
headphones (up 9 percentage points to 36% ownership); and smart TVs (up 7
percentage points to 50% ownership).
The Internet-of-Things (IoT) continues to drive growth in emerging tech devices. 
Among the fastest-growing tech categories, wearable fitness activity trackers are now
owned by 20% of U.S. households, almost double the number of households that
owned the technology in 2015.  Another 15% of households plan to purchase a device
in 2016.  Smart home devices (smart thermostats, lighting controls, motion sensors,
etc.), led by smart thermostats, are now owned in 15% of households.  Additionally, 8%
of households currently own a smartwatch and another 8% are planning to buy one in
2016.
The following are the most-owned tech products in 2016:
Televisions
•
Owned in 96% of households, market penetration is down by one percentage point
from 2015.  There are now almost as many TVs owned (320 million installed base)
as the U.S. population (321 million).  Twenty-two percent (22%) of consumers say
they never intend to buy a TV, an increase from 18% in 2015.  This is likely due to
diffusion of video consumption across multiple device screens.
DVD/Blu-ray Players
•
Owned by 77% of households, DVD/Blu-ray players are the second-most popular
device, but ownership has experienced a downward trend over the last five years.
Smartphones
•
Owned by 74% of U.S. households, smartphone ownership is up two percentage
points from 2015.  On average, Americans now own 2.4 smartphones per
household, and the expected smartphone repeat purchase is 91%, comparable 
only to television ownership trends.
Laptop/Notebooks
•
U.S. household penetration of laptops or notebooks is 68%, the same as in 2015.
Headphones
•
Sixty-three percent (63%) of U.S. households own at least one pair of headphones,
which replaced digital cameras in 2016 as the fifth-most owned tech device.

21.4  Category Assessment
CTA assesses consumer technology categories as follows:
3D Printing
•
An expanding diversity of 3D printing capabilities will drive the sector’s growth in
2016.  CTA expects 3D printer sales to increase 64% from 2015, to reach 179,000
units sold, with total revenues of $152 million, a 38% increase.
Drones
•
CTA expects U.S. sales of drones weighing more than 250 grams – the minimum for
FAA-mandated registration – to reach one million units in 2016, a 145% increase
from 2015’s total.  When adding drones weighing 250 grams or less to those totals,
the total forecast for 2016 drone sales tops 2.8 million units (up 149% from 2015)
and $953 million in shipment revenues (a 115% increase from 2015).
Laptops
•
Unit shipments of traditional laptops are estimated to reach 27.6 million units in
2016, a 2% increase over 2015.  Increasing sales of 2-in-1 computers (including
both convertible laptops and detachable tablets) will drive this category’s growth,
with 11.7 million units sold in 2016 (48% growth over 2015) and $8 billion in
revenue.
Smart Home
•
CTA expects the smart home technology category – including smart thermostats,
smart smoke and CO2 detectors, IP/Wi-Fi cameras, smart locks, smart home
systems, and smart switches, dimmers and outlets – to reach 8.9 million units sold
in 2016 (a 21% increase), with $1.2 billion in revenue.
Smartphones
•
As the dominant sales category in the industry, smartphone unit shipments are
projected to reach 183 million this year, up 5% from 2015.  Smartphone revenues
will reach $55 billion in 2016, a 4% increase from 2015.
Tablets
•
After significant growth and wide adoption over the past five years, tablet sales will
continue to decline in 2016.  CTA projects unit sales to reach 60 million this year, a
9% decrease from 2015.  Revenues are expected to hit $18 billion, down 12%.
Televisions
•
After a banner year of sales growth in 2015 that saw LCD TV shipments climb 10%
to top 39 million units, the TV market should reach a steady state in 2016.  CTA
projects revenues will reach $19 billion for all TV sets and displays in 2016, on par
with 2015, as volumes drop 1% to just under 40 million units. 
•

2016 to top $10 billion, marking a 65% increase.
Video and Audio
•
IoT connectivity is transforming core consumer tech categories.  In video, sales of
smart TVs are projected to top 27 million units in 2016, a 13% increase over 2015,
and sales of streaming media players will hit 15.8 million units, a 5% increase.
•
Connected speakers and wireless headphones are the standout categories in audio. 
Unit sales of Bluetooth/Airplay-capable speakers are expected to reach 17.4 million
units in 2016 – a 40% increase – and $1.5 billion in revenue, while sales of wireless
headphones will reach 3.9 million in unit sales (increasing 30%) and $623 million in
revenue.
Virtual Reality (VR)
•
With several notable VR headsets coming to market in 2016, CTA expects unit
sales to increase by 500% over 2015, to reach 1.2 million units sold.  Total revenues
are projected to reach $540 million, a 440% increase.
Wearables
•
Led by the popularity of fitness activity trackers and smart watches, unit sales
among all wearables in 2016 are forecast to reach 38.4 million units.  Fitness activity
tracker volumes will hit 17.4 million units in 2016 – a 12% increase from 2015 – with
revenues reaching $1.3 billion.  Smart watches are expected to increase 28% to
13.6 million units, earning $3.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 22%.
21.5  Technology Impact
A November 2015 Harris Poll (www.theharrispoll.com) found adults are divided
on how technology impacts the way we live our lives.  On the one hand, 71% say that
technology has improved the overall quality of their lives and 68% believe that it
encourages people to be more creative.  But at the same time, a strong majority of
adults also believe technology is creating a lazy society (73%), has become too

According to PIRG Educational Fund (www.uspirgedfund.org), 67% of Americans
ages 16-to-24 have a driver’s license, the lowest level in roughly a half-century.  Among
adults older than age 24, 87% have a driver’s license.
Americans of all ages have reduced their driving.  Since 2001, the total distance
Americans drove fell by about 1% – the U.S. population grew by about 10% during
those years.  Among the lower percentage of youth and young adults who drive, a weak
economy, growing urban populations, and rising fuel prices contributed to the decline.
According to International Demographics (www.themediaaudit.com), 15.8% of
adults are high-mileage drivers, driving more than 350 miles in a typical week.  Among
high-mileage drivers, 45% earn more than $75,000 in household income, a figure that is
46% higher when compared to the typical U.S. adult.  Further, 29.2% of high mileage
drivers earn more than $100,000 in income, compared to 18.8% of all U.S. adults who
fall into the same income category.

According to Pew Research Center (www.pewresearch.org), 88% of all
households own or lease at least one vehicle, the same percentage as in 2001. 
However, among households headed by a person age 18-to-24, vehicle ownership
dropped from 72% to 66%.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Among most age groups, the level of ownership
is similar to 2001.  However, among households
headed by those younger than 25, a decline is
evident.  The decline in vehicle ownership may
be a reflection of declining preferences to drive
among the young adult population.”

According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (www.nada.org),
dealerships sold or leased 17.4 million new cars and light trucks in 2015, a 5.8%

22.5  Private Aviation
There are an estimated 2.7 million Americans with flying experience.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA, www.faa.gov), there were
590,039 active certificated pilots in the U.S. at year-end 2015.  This number has been
declining gradually over the past several decades, down from a high of over 827,000
pilots in 1980.  One factor contributing to the decline in piloting is the expense of flight
training and costs associated with operating and maintaining a plane.  It can cost
$8,000 to $10,000 for training and licensing, followed by $200 or more an hour for
aircraft rental, according to Michael Miller, an aviation consultant for The Velocity Group
(www.velocity-group.com).
The total number of pilots in 2015 included 170,718 private pilots, 122,729
student pilots, and 5,482 sport pilots.  About 7% of pilots are female.  The state of
Alaska has the highest number of pilots per capita; out of an estimated 410,478 adult
residents there were 7,933 pilots in 2015, a ratio of about 1:52.
According to the FAA, pilots log 28 million flying hours annually, approximately
one-third of which are for recreation and personal use.

transportation, operates a fleet of more than 1,735 active buses and serves about
3,800 destinations in North America.  Greyhound logged 5.5 billion passenger miles in
2015.
Recent startups BoltBus (www.boltbus.com) and Megabus (www.megabus.com)
appeal to budget-minded, urban-dwelling young adults by providing a hip image,
technology (complimentary wi-fi and power outlets at every seat), and cheap fares. 
These companies hold costs down by providing city-center curbside pickup in lieu of
service at bus terminals.

22.8  Public Transit
Public transit services include transit bus; commuter, subway, elevated, and light
rail trains; and other kinds of public transit, such as ferry boats.  
According to the National Transit Database of the Federal Transit Administration
(www.fta.dot.gov), there are 729 urban transit agencies and 1,580 rural and tribal
government transit agencies in the United States.  Transit ridership includes over 10
billion unlinked transit trips on these systems each year.
Ridership by rail has grown rapidly in recent years due, in part, to considerable
public investment.  Still, buses account for the vast majority of transit routes and
passengers.

IN-STORE SHOPPING
23.1  Preference For In-Store
The Harris Poll (www.theharrispoll.com) found that consumers generally report
higher satisfaction with bricks-and-mortar stores than with online shopping.  
    _________________________________________________________________
“There are many reasons why a consumer
would choose to visit a location-based retailer
over its online counterpart, including
convenience, selection, and immediate needs. 
Most of all, shoppers tend to want to interact
with physical merchandise before purchasing it. 
Trend data shows that while consumers are
increasingly shopping online, their brand
experience when doing so tends to score lower
than their in-store experience.”

In a survey by Synqera (www.synqera.com), 67% of adults said they prefer to
shop in traditional, bricks-and-mortar stores than at commerce sites online.  The survey
found that 80% of shoppers are more likely to shop in a store that provides an overall
customized shopping experience, and 66% are more likely to shop in a store where
they receive personal suggestions while shopping.
23.2  Shopping Centers
According to The State of the Shopping Center, a report by The Nielsen
Company (www.nielsen.com), traditional shopping centers have morphed into lifestyle
centers which blend traditional retail with upscale leisure options that offer shoppers a
place to gather and socialize as well as to shop.  The lines between shopping,
entertainment, and community are increasingly becoming blurred.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Even in a world where consumers can connect
with each other via text in an instant and do
their shopping from their couches, people still
crave a physical place to congregate, connect
and engage.  And more and more, shopping
centers are a big part of fulfilling that need.  No
longer just a place to shop, shopping centers
are key activity centers in the social fabric of
communities, elevating their purpose beyond
simply offering an outlet to buy groceries or
pick up a new blouse.”

23.3  How America Shops
Since 2004, WSL Strategic Retail (www.wslstrategicretail.com) has annually
surveyed U.S. consumers about their shopping behaviors.  The most recent
assessment, How America Shops, provides insight into the behavior of today’s retail
shopper.  The following are key findings from the study:
•
Seventy-five percent (75%) of consumers say it is important to get the lowest price
on everything they buy.  
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  160  •

•
Sixty-eight percent (68%) of shoppers say they regularly use coupons to reduce
costs.
•
Sixty-six percent (66%) of shoppers say they take a pause before buying to ask, “Is
this a smart use of my money?”  Among those with a household income of $150,000
or more, 47% do so.
•
Fifty-eight percent (58%) of consumers say they manage their aspirations by sticking
to brands and stores they can afford.  Among those with a household income of
$150,000 or more, 36% do so.
•
Forty-eight percent (48%) of consumers say they are staying out of stores where
they might be tempted to overspend.  Among those with a household income of
$150,000 or more, 28% do so.
•
Forty-five percent (45%) of shoppers claim they only buy items that are on sale.
•
Forty-three percent (43%) of consumers make a point to search online for store
discounts before they shop.
•
Twenty-six percent (26%) of shoppers admit that while they used to buy brand
names they could not afford, they are no longer giving in to this indulgence.
•
Fourteen percent (14%) of consumers say they use their mobile phones while in a
store to see if they can find a lower price, before they buy.
WSL Strategic Retail identified the following trends in 2015:
•
The American Dream today among shoppers is to be debt-free and it’s influencing
every buying decision.  In addition, half of shoppers still struggle to afford the basics.
Younger shoppers are using every tool to get what they want, how they want it, at
the price they want to spend.
•
Shoppers still prefer name brands, but in most categories 2 or 3 name brands are
equally good enough.  Which brand they choose often comes down to the lowest
price at that moment.
•
Fifty-six percent (56%) of shoppers make CPG brand decisions at the shelf (“first
moment of truth”), but the future is Google’s “zero moment of truth,” where shoppers
decide what to buy before the store.  Of those who pre-shop, fewer than 15%
change their mind in-store.
•
Today, convenience drives retail choice, but there are so many options.  Most
shoppers expect low prices everywhere they shop and rarely need to compromise. 
Neither convenience nor price drives loyalty among shoppers today.
•
Shoppers who connect with retailers digitally are more loyal to that retailer.  For
retailers who question investment in digital tools, this is a call to action.
23.4  The In-Store Experience
In a survey by Motorola Solutions (www.motorolasolutions.com), 74% of retail
executives said they believe that developing a more engaging in-store experience will
be critical to their business.  Survey participants foresee the following technological
developments occurring in the retail marketplace over the next five years:

based on previous behavior:
41%
•
Will recognize customer in store with geofencing or presence 
technology:
35%
Consumers’ cross-channel shopping behaviors will change retailers’ marketing
strategies.  Retail USA: 2016, a study from Nielsen, forecasts the retail marketplace will
change in the following ways:
•
Store footprints either will get supersized for one-stop-shop convenience or
downsized into smaller stores for quick grab-and-go trips.
•
For people who view shopping as entertainment that engages all the senses,
lifestyle outlets will blur the line of demarcation between traditional formats, merging
restaurants with food markets, serving up food and wine tastings, providing live
music and movies, and creating places for friends and co-workers to gather and
socialize.
•
Technology will bring consumers into the shopping experience via options such as
touchscreen ordering, QR code advertising, mobile coupons, and shopping lists.
•
Store brands will mushroom to include super premium offerings joined by an
increasing number of restaurant and celebrity-chef brands, while a few consumer
packaged goods brands will transition onto restaurant menus.
•
The Big Four technology companies (i.e., Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google)
will establish beachheads outside the tech world, challenging conventional players
to re-think their business models and forge new alliances or chance seeing
themselves become less relevant.
•
Deep discounters will continue to keep the cap on operating costs in order to
maintain their price edge, but low prices alone have not been enough to guarantee
sales success.
•
Retailers will expand designated stores-within-a store spaces, pulling together
related items that fulfill a consumer need into a discrete space such as a cosmetics
department complete with expert consultants, occasion-based home meal solution
centers, or dedicated pet care areas.
•
Mobile and online technologies will enable one-to-one marketing, customized
shopping lists, menu plans, coupons, and other content to reflect user interests 
and consumption patterns.
•
Online avatars and in-store service agents will assist consumers with meal
management, entertainment, health and wellness monitoring, and fashion
selections.
•
In-store shelf-talkers will take on a new, interactive dimension with QR codes that
connect directly to robust websites offering discounts and cross merchandising
suggestions such as wine pairings.

The chasm between income and wealth strata will enable retailers at both the high
and low ends of the price spectrum to prosper by merchandising to niche audiences.
23.5  Self-Service
In the survey by Synqera, 73% of shoppers say they find waiting in the checkout
line their least favorite aspect of in-store shopping.
A survey by Buzzback Market Research (www.buzzback.com) found that 66% of
shoppers feel that self-service technology creates a more positive perception of the
deployer’s brand.
According to IHL Group (www.ihlservices.com), consumers made $312 billion in
purchases through self-checkout lanes in 2015.  Self-service transactions are growing
at 7% per year.
A survey by Shapiro+Raj (www.ljs.com) found consumers divided on the benefits
of self checkout.  Only 43% said it shortens checkout time, while 38% feel it lengthens
checkout.  Still, given a choice, 39% say they prefer self-checkout over a cashier.

24.5  Shopping On Social Sites
E-commerce transactions through storefronts on social media sites, dubbed
social commerce, held great promise a few years ago with the rise in popularity of
social networking.  Consumers, however, have shown that they do not prefer to shop on
social sites.  A recent Harris Poll found that just 5% of U.S. adult Internet users had
made a purchase on a social network such as Facebook, Twitter, or Pinterest.

    _________________________________________________________________
Most social network storefronts have now closed.  According to 8th Bridge
(www.8thbridge.com), 62% of retailers with Facebook apps had product browsing in
2012.  Now, less than 15% do so.

experience.  
Fifty-five percent (55%) of survey respondents report that they struggle at least
20% of the time when using a mobile app to shop.  Forty-three percent (43%) say they
have come to expect no customer service at all from mobile apps.
Mobile shoppers respond to shopping difficulties via an app as follows

Ninety-five percent (95%) say that a great customer experience will make them
more likely to do business again with a retailer. 
Ninety-two percent (92%) of shoppers say it would be helpful to have customer
care automatically provided within an app to help complete a task.
25.6  In-Store Mobile
A study by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA; www.cta.tech) found
that 58% of shoppers prefer to look up information on their mobile devices while
shopping in stores, rather than talk to a salesperson.  Shoppers ages 25-to-44 and men
were most likely to prefer to access their device for product information.  Nearly
two-thirds felt that the information they gather on their mobile devices is more helpful
than in-store information from product displays or sales literature.

PEER-TO-PEER SHOPPING
26.1  Overview
The peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace – which goes by a host of monikers such as 
collaborative consumption, communal consumption, asset-light lifestyle, the peer
economy, and the sharing economy – lets individuals rent unused assets or sell goods
and services to other individuals.  The economic downturn was the impetus for growth
of the concept.
Today there are numerous Internet-based services available to aggregate supply
and demand. 
    _________________________________________________________________
“Why pay through the nose for something when
you can rent it more cheaply from a stranger
online?  That is the principle behind a range of
online services that enable people to share cars,
accommodations, bicycles, household appliances,
and other items, connecting owners of underused
assets with others willing to pay to use them. 
Dozens of firms such as Airbnb, which lets people
rent out their spare rooms, or RelayRides, which
allows other people to rent your car, act as
matchmakers, allocating resources where they are
needed and taking a small cut in return.”

26.6  Economic Impact
According to Arun Sundararajan, Ph.D., a professor at the Stern School of
Business at New York University, the largest question for academics is whether the
sharing economy simply replaces existing businesses or creates new value.  People
have purchased residential properties and automobiles solely to rent them out, for
example, indicating the concept has an extended impact.
While the sharing economy clearly poses a competitive threat to traditional
businesses, it also has a positive economic impact on cities.  A study commissioned by
Airbnb found that because peer-to-peer rentals tend to be cheaper than a hotel, people
often stay longer and spend 31% more than those who stay in a comparable hotel. 
Among those who rented an Airbnb property in San Francisco, for example, 14% said
they would not have visited the city at all without Airbnb.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Of course established travel companies won’t
go out of business as a result of this sharing
revolution, but the way we travel will almost
certainly become more efficient.  Put differently,
your next ‘hotel’ may be someone’s spare
bedroom, your next ride to the airport might be
n another person’s car, and you might rent a
stranger’s vehicle when you arrive.”
  USA Today
    _________________________________________________________________
Renting out underused assets can be profitable.  Airbnb reports that hosts in San
Francisco who rent out their homes do so for an average of 58 nights a year, earning a
median $9,300.  Car owners who rent their vehicles to others using RelayRides make
an average of $250 a month; some make more than $1,000 monthly.

OMNICHANNEL SHOPPING

Omnichannel shopping allows consumers to shop across multiple channels – in-
store, online, and on a tablet or cellphone – potentially at the same time.  Shopping by
catalog and by TV are also part of the omnichannel retail mix.
In the 17th Annual Customer Engagement Survey, conducted in January 2016 by
Boston Retail Partners (www.bostonretailpartners.com), 85% of retail executives 
reported that unified commerce was their leading priority.  Similarly, retail executives
said in a survey by KPMG (www.kpmg.com) that omnichannel strategies were their #1
priority.  
Boston Retail Partners reported the following percentages of retailers offered
select omnichannel options at year-end 2015:
•

According to Omnichannel Preferences Study, a report by A.T. Kearney
(www.atkearney.com), 67% of consumers who purchase online use the physical store
before or after the transaction.
Forrester Research (www.forrester.com) found that 71% of consumers expect to
view in-store inventory online.
In the Multichannel Consumer Survey, by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC,

retailers than with either online-only retailers or stores with bricks-and-mortar-only
locations.

In a survey of cardholders, VISA found that 83% of adults would choose a
retailer based on how easy it is to transact across online, in-store, and mobile.
27.4  Cross-Channel Shopping
“Showrooming” is the practice where customers go to a bricks-and-mortar retail
location, make a decision on what item to buy and, instead of heading to the check-out
aisle, use a mobile device to find a better price online where they ultimately make their
purchase.  “Webrooming” occurs when consumers buy in a store after researching a
purchase online.
GfK (www.gfk.com) reported that 28% of consumers engage in showrooming;
41% practice webrooming.  By age, those who engage in these practices are as

28.3  Store Brands
The influence of cost on brand loyalty increases as consumers are impacted by
economic conditions.  In a survey by Accenture (www.accenture.com), 39% of
consumers said they increased their purchases of store brands or private label brands
in recent years because of the economy.  The study reported the following attitudes
toward private label products (percentage of respondents):

“In response to consumer demand, retailers
across the country are freshening and
extending existing private label offerings and
rushing to their shelves whole new lines of
store brands to leverage evolving lifestyles and
desirable product attributes and to stay
competitive with the rival down the street and
its own popular store brands.”
     The Nielsen Co., 3/4/16
    _________________________________________________________________
For several years department stores have been creating stronger private labels
while also eliminating underperforming or over-distributed supplier brands to increase
their consumer appeal and reduce pervasive sameness.  In 2007, the percentage of
sales at Macy’s in exclusive or limited-distribution brands, including its private label
lines, was 35%.  By 2015, store brands increased to 45% of sales.  The percentage is
even higher at Kohl’s and JCPenney, where private label brands represent 48% and
50% of sales, respectively.
28.4  Brand Loyalty In Travel
A survey by Deloitte (www.deloitte.com) found that only 14% of travelers say
they are loyal to a particular airline; just 8% say they are loyal to any hotel brand.
Price, comfort and service drive decisions more than loyalty programs.  When
picking airlines, most travelers say they look first at safety, value, and whether flights
are on time.  When choosing hotels, they look at price, whether there is free parking,
comfort, and location.  Loyalty programs rank near the bottom of influencing factors.
28.5  Increasing Brand Loyalty
Various studies point to convenience, customer service, loyalty programs, price,
and social network connections as influences on customer loyalty.
Convenience
•
According to Brand Keys (www.brandkeys.com), convenience increases product
and service consideration, adoption, and loyalty by 19%.

Customer Service
•
Few things can affect customer loyalty like customer service.  According to a survey
by Accenture, in assessing loyalty related to retailers of technology products, over
80% of customers who rated their service below average said they would buy from a
different company next time.  Merely average service dropped customer purchasing
loyalty from 51% to 27%. 
Customer Surveys
•
Many customers feel more loyal to a brand if it takes the time to find out their
opinion.  In a survey by Cint (www.cint.com), 62% of customers said they were more
likely to purchase a brand’s product if their opinion has been sought by the brand.
Price
•
A survey by Acxiom (www.acxiom.com) found that 53% of adults would change to a
new auto insurance carrier to save $300 annually.
Social Network Connections
•
Studies have shown that a company’s social followers are more likely to buy the
brand’s products.  In a survey by Chadwick Martin Bailey (www.cmbinfo.com), more
than half of Facebook users said they are likely to purchase at least a few brands
they are social friends and followers of; 67% of Twitter followers indicated the same. 
Also, 60% of respondents claimed their Facebook fandom increased the chance
that they would recommend a brand to a friend; among Twitter followers, that
percentage rose to almost 80%.

BUYING LOCAL
30.1  Buying Local
According to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (www.ilsr.org), for every $100
spent at a locally owned store, $45 remains in the local economy, compared with about
$13 per $100 spent at a national chain retailer.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Locally owned businesses create more jobs
locally and, in some sectors, provide better
wages and benefits than chains do.  Compared
to chain stores, locally owned businesses
recycle a much larger share of their revenue
back into the local economy, enriching the
whole community.”
        Stacy Mitchell, Senior Researcher 
        Institute for Local Self-Reliance
    _________________________________________________________________
Civic Economics (www.civiceconomics.com) estimated that if San Francisco Bay
Area consumers shifted 10% of their spending from national chains to local businesses,
the impact would be $192 million in increased economic activity for the region and
almost 1,300 new jobs.
According to Time, 82% of consumers actively support local or neighborhood
businesses. 
30.2  Locally Sourced Food Products
There has been a trend of increased demand for locally sourced foods at
restaurants, farmers’ markets, and groceries among patrons.  While locally grown foods
are not necessarily healthier, consumers are comforted by knowing the source of their
food items.  As concerns about food safety rise, the number of locavores – those who
eat locally produced foods when available – is also increasing.

factor that’s been getting its fair share of media
attention and in-store callouts is ‘local.’ ”
Harris Poll, 12/8/15
    _________________________________________________________________
In a survey by the National Restaurant Association (www.restaurant.org), 64% of
adults said locally sourced menu items are important when choosing a full-service
restaurant (FSR).  For comparison, 43% said organic or environmentally friendly food
was important.  In choosing a quick-service restaurant (QSR), locally sourced and
organic menu items were cited as an important consideration by 63% and 45% of
adults, respectfully.  By gender and age, those placing a priority on locally sourced, and
for comparison, organic menu items are as follows:

Opinions vary as to what constitutes ‘local’ food products.  In a survey by The
Hartman Group (www.hartman-group.com), consumers defined ‘local product’ as
follows:
•
Within 100 miles:
    50%
•
Within my state:
    37%
•
Within a region:
      4%
•
In the United States:
      4%
In a survey by A.T. Kearney (www.atkearney.com), the following percentages of
adults said they are willing to pay more for local foods:
•
Single urban households:
95%
•
Young couples w/o kids:
78%
•
Affluent families:
71%
•
Senior citizens:
68%
•
Middle income families:
67%
•
Low income families:
57%
A.T. Kearney found that grocery shoppers largely embrace local food options
because they believe it helps local economies (66%), delivers a broader and better
assortment of products (60%), and provides healthier alternatives (45%).  Some
shoppers say they buy local food to improve the carbon footprint (19%) and to help
increase natural or organic production (19%).
When asked about the availability of local food at their preferred supermarket,
65% say their supermarket offers at least some kind of locally sourced food.  Almost
30% of grocery shoppers say they consider purchasing food elsewhere if their preferred
store does not carry local foods.  Only 5% indicate they shop for local foods at big-box
retailers, 15% at national supermarkets.  Overwhelmingly, respondents say their main
source for local food is the local farmers market and farm stores.

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
31.1  Overview
In general, the more confident people feel about the economy and their job and
income, the less likely they are to avoid making purchases.  When confidence is
trending down, consumers are likely to slow their spending, thus the rate of economic
growth slows.  Conversely, when consumer confidence is trending up, the economy
typically grows with increases in consumer spending.
There are several recognized measurements of consumer confidence.  This
chapter provides a review of various assessments.
31.2  Consumer Comfort Index
The Consumer Comfort Index, which began in 1985, is announced weekly by
Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com/consumer-comfort-index/).
The following three questions are used to calculate the index:
•
Would you describe the state of the nation’s economy these days as excellent,
good, not so good, or poor?
•
Would you describe the state of your own personal finances these days as
excellent, good, not so good, or poor?
•
Considering the cost of things today and your own personal finances, would you say
now is an excellent time, a good time, a not so good time, or a poor time to buy the
things you want and need?
The index is derived from telephone interviews conducted by Langer Research
Associates (www.langerresearch.com).  The margin of error is ±3 percentage points.
31.3  Consumer Confidence Index
The Consumer Confidence Index is calculated each month by The Conference
Board (www.conference-board.org) based on a survey of consumers’ opinions on
present conditions and future expectations of the economy.  The Consumer Confidence
Index was started in 1967 and is benchmarked at a reference of 100 for 1985, a year
chosen because it was neither a peak nor a trough.  Opinions on current conditions
make up 40% of the index, with expectations of future conditions comprising the
remaining 60%. 
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  195  •

Each month The Conference Board surveys 5,000 U.S. households.  The survey
consists of five questions that ask respondents’ opinions about the following:
•
Current business conditions
•
Business conditions for the next six months 
•
Current employment conditions 
•
Employment conditions for the next six months 
•
Total family income for the next six months 
Survey participants are asked to answer each question as ‘positive,’ ‘negative,’
or ‘neutral.’  The relative value is calculated for each question separately and compared
against each relative value from 1985.  This comparison of the relative values results in
an index value for each question.  The index values for all five questions are then
averaged together to form the Consumer Confidence Index.  The data is calculated for
the United States as a whole and for each of the country’s nine census regions.
The results from the Consumer Confidence Survey are posted at 
www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm on the last Tuesday of each
month at 10:00 a.m. EST.
31.4  Consumer Sentiment Index
The Consumer Sentiment Index is one of the most recognized among several
consumer confidence measures.  It was devised in the late 1940s by Prof. George
Katona at the University of Michigan.  The index is calculated monthly based on 500
telephone household interviews conducted by the University of Michigan’s Institute for
Social Research (www.sca.isr.umich.edu/).  Thomson Reuters publishes the Consumer
Sentiment Index.
The University of Michigan releases three related figures each month: the Index
of Consumer Sentiment (ICS, or MCSI), the Index of Current Economic Conditions
(ICC), and the Index of Consumer Expectations (ICE).  The ICE is an official
component of the U.S. Index of Leading Economic Indicators.
31.5  Current Economic Conditions
The Current Economic Conditions report, commonly known as the Beige Book, 
is published by the Federal Reserve Board eight times per year.  Each Federal Reserve
Bank gathers anecdotal information on current economic conditions in its district
through reports from bank and branch directors and interviews with key business
contacts, economists, market experts, and other sources.  The Beige Book summarizes
this information by district and sector.
The Current Economic Conditions reports are available online at
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/beigebook/default.htm.

31.6  Economic Confidence Index
The Gallup Organization (www.gallup.com) continuously monitors consumer
confidence with a two-question survey.  The percentage of Americans classifying
economic conditions as positive, negative, and mixed is reported daily based on a
three-day rolling average of surveys of approximately 1,500 adults.
The poll, which guides the determination of Gallup’s Economic Confidence
Index, consists of the following questions:
•
How would you rate economic conditions in this country today: as excellent, good,
only fair, or poor?
•
Right now, do you think that economic conditions in the country as a whole are
getting better or getting worse?
Gallup reports on its website the Economic Confidence Index on a daily, weekly,
monthly, and quarterly basis.  The data is posted at
www.gallup.com/Search/Default.aspx?s=&p=1&q=economic+confidence+index&b=Go.

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
32.1  Overview
Surveys by Service Management Group (SMG, www.smg.com) assess various
aspects of customer satisfaction at retail stores.  The surveys query customers based
on their most recent retail visit and compare various factors that relate to customer
satisfaction.
32.2  Factors Contributing To High Customer Satisfaction
The following are findings from recent SMG surveys:
Corporate Headquarters Markets
SMG research found chain retail stores don’t have an advantage with locations
in the same city as corporate headquarters.  Customers rated their satisfaction at chain
locations as follows:
                                                                           Overall Satisfaction            Likely To Return

    _________________________________________________________________
“Customers visiting retail stores in the same
city as the brand’s corporate headquarters are
actually slightly less satisfied than customers
visiting locations in other cities.  Customers
may have slightly higher expectations of brands
that are headquartered close to their home.”
       Service Management Group
    _________________________________________________________________
First-Time vs. Returning Customers
SMG found that first-time customers are generally more difficult to satisfy than
returning customers.  Survey results are as follows:

“Across retail segments, first-time customers
are generally less satisfied overall than
returning customers.  Loyalty to a brand is
generally built up over time – one experience is
often not enough to create a loyal customer.”
                 Service Management Group
    _________________________________________________________________
Large vs. Small Stores
Based on the size of the store, customers rated their satisfaction with retail
locations as follows:
                                     Overall Satisfaction            Likely To Return

“Customers in the smallest footprint stores are
slightly more satisfied.  As stores increase in
size, customers are somewhat less satisfied
and less likely to recommend the store to their
friends and family.  These findings support the
recent move by retailers to create smaller
footprint locations in order to deliver better
experiences.  Most typically, customer issues in
larger stores center on locating products and
finding assistance.”

Rural vs. Urban Locations
Based on market population, the following percentages of customers said they

experience:

•

“Rural customers are slightly more satisfied
overall with their retail concepts.  Rural

33.3  Use Of Products With An Environmental Benefit
The following are findings of Cone Communications’ Green Gap Trend Tracker
survey related to the use of products with an environmental benefit:
•
Ninety percent (90%) of adults say they believe it’s their responsibility to properly
use and dispose of products with an environmental benefit, but their actions do not
align with intent.  Only 30% say they often use products in a way that achieves the
intended environmental benefit; 42% say they dispose of products in a way that
fulfills the intended environmental benefit.
•
Eighty-five percent (85%) of adults say they want companies to educate them on
how to properly use and dispose of products.
•
Seventy-eight percent (78%) say they will boycott a product if they discover an
environmental claim to be misleading.
•
Seventy-one percent (71%) of consumers say they wish companies would do a
better job helping them understand environmental terms.  
•
Seventy-one percent (71%) of adults say they regularly read and follow instructions
on how to properly use a product, 66% read proper-disposal instructions, and 41%
say they perform additional research to determine how best to utilize and discard a
product for maximum benefit. 
•
Although more than 60% of respondents say they understand the environmental
terms companies use in their advertising, the majority continue to erroneously
believe common expressions such as “green” or “environmentally friendly” mean a
product has a positive (40%) or neutral (22%) impact on the environment.  Fewer
were able to correctly identify these terms as meaning the product has a lighter
impact than other similar products (22%) or less than it used to (2%).  Despite the
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  203  •

attention given to product development and environmental marketing, consumer
misunderstanding of “green” claims has remained flat at around 60% since 2008.
33.4  Ethical Influence On Purchase Decisions
According to The Ethical Consumer U.S., a November 2015 report by Mintel
(www.mintel.com), 23% of adults say their purchase decisions are always or often
influenced by a company’s ethics; an additional 47% say that their decisions are
influenced sometimes.
Actions taken when they believe a company is ethical or unethical are as follows

“While the annual year-end holiday gifting
season receives the lion’s share of marketer
and retailer attention when it comes to the
gifting market, the reality is that gifting
represents a significant marketing opportunity
throughout the whole year.  Out of the typical
gifters’ annual gifting budget, Christmas
accounts for slightly less than half of the total.

Not only are gift cards used as gifts for all occasions, they are also used to
transfer money.  Parents and family gave $2.9 billion worth of gift cards to students for
back-to-college in 2015, according to the National Retail Federation.
CardHub (www.cardhub.com) estimates that some $44 billion in unredeemed
gift-card value has been accumulating since 2008.
34.4  Responsible Gift Giving
The Responsible Giving Survey, conducted by Ketchum Global Research
Network (www.ketchum.com), studied the intent behind giving and examined how
attitudes and culture shape gifting decisions and shopping habits.  The survey found
that 78% of adults give gifts during the holiday season because they want to and not
out of a sense of obligation.  
The following are other findings of the survey:
•
Eighty-one percent (81%) of adults appreciate charitable donations given on their
behalf in lieu of a gift; 74% would volunteer their time to charity as a gift if they
thought others would value this type of responsible giving.
•
Fifty-nine percent (59%) of adults prepare alternative gifts such as homemade gifts
and make donations of time or money to charities during the holiday season.
•
Forty-nine percent (49%) of married men say their spouse takes full responsibility for
purchasing holiday gifts; 75% of married women say they take full responsibility for
purchasing holiday gifts.

Thirty-three percent (33%) of married men say they and their spouse share the
responsibility of purchasing holiday gifts, but only 20% of married women say the
same.
•
Forty percent (40%) say that giving a homemade gift is better than giving a store-
bought gift.
•
Parents are more likely than adults without children to say they will make gifts rather
than purchase some gifts (40% of parents vs. 29% of non-parents).
•
Fifty-seven percent (57%) of those employed gave a gift to coworkers; 42% gave
their boss a gift.
•
Women are more likely than men to give a holiday gift or tip to people at work.
•
Older adults ages 65 and above are more likely than adults overall to give a holiday
gift or tip to people whose services they employ, such as a hairstylist (59% vs. 41%
overall), a gardener or housekeeper (57% vs. 41% overall), or a mail or newspaper
carrier (54% vs. 40% overall).
Fifty-nine percent (59%) of adults say that they have never re-gifted, though a
similar number of adults say that re-gifting is socially acceptable.  Among those who
say that re-gifting is not socially acceptable, 22% admit that despite that belief, they
have re-gifted.
The majority of adults agree that it’s important to set an agreed-upon spending
limit for gifts between family members or friends.  Half agree that you should consider
how much someone else can afford to spend when purchasing a gift for them.
Thirty percent (30%) of adults think someone is being irresponsible if they do not
send a note of thanks for a gift.  Older adults ages 50 and above are more likely than
younger adults ages 18-to-29 to agree that someone is being irresponsible if they do
not send a note of thanks for a gift (44% of older adults vs. 20% of younger adults). 
34.5  Wedding Gift Giving
A survey by Claria Corporation (www.claria.com) reported that 75% of adults
attend one to three weddings each year.  Eighty percent (80%) buy gifts from the bride
and groom’s registry; 34% purchase wedding gifts through online retail channels.
Sixty-five percent (65%) typically buy gifts for all couples who invite them to a
wedding, 30% only purchase gifts for weddings they attend.  Sixty percent (60%) of
respondents reported spending $26 to $75 for a wedding gift. 
Ninety-four percent (94%) of engaged couples are registered.
34.6  Graduation Gift Giving
According to the National Retail Federation, 30% of consumers purchase a
graduation gift, spending collectively approximately $4 billion each year.  The average
consumer buying graduation gifts gives to two graduates and spends an average of $90
on gifts.

34.7  Returning Gifts
The downside to gift-giving and -receiving is gifts that are unwanted.  According
to a Western Union survey, 75% of Americans have pretended to like a gift they
received.  
The National Retail Federation estimates that 10% of holiday purchases are
returned.  A survey by Consumer Reports found that about half of Americans include
receipts with their gifts to help with returns and exchanges.  A survey by HomeGoods
found that 54% of adults had re-gifted presents; 36% had done so on several
occasions.

Seventy percent (70%) of loyalty programs offer free enrollment to their customers;
16% tier their fee structure and rewards program.
•
The use of loyalty programs in the financial services sector is on the rise, due in part
to the expanded range of premium reward card products designed to build loyalty

Many retailers are restructuring their loyalty programs with tiered membership
levels.  By exceeding spending thresholds members achieve elite status and associated
perks.  The highest reward level for Sephora’s Beauty Insider program, for example,
gives free shipping, early access to new products and sales, and VIP event invites for
shoppers who spend $1,000 or more in a year.  At Nordstrom, making it into the upper
tiers requires $2,000, $5,000, or $10,000 in annual spending.  At Best Buy, Premier

“For many years, cash and paper checks
dominated consumers’ wallets, with consumers
using cash for smaller dollar-value transactions
and selecting checks for big-ticket items.  This

“Do not be deceived by the use of ‘alternative’ in
online alternative payments, as these payment
options have clearly become mainstream for
online retail payments.  Over 80% of online
shoppers report that they have used an online
alternative payment service (such as PayPal,
Amazon Payments, or Google Wallet) for an
online purchase.  And the reach does not stop
there.  Increasingly, platforms that were once

PRICING
37.1  Overview
Along with product, promotion, and place, pricing is one of the Four Ps of the
classic marketing mix.
Most customers consider pricing the most important aspect of shopping.  A
recent survey by The NPD Group (www.npd.com) asked consumers what factors they
considered extremely important in deciding where to shop.  Responses were as follows
(percentage of respondents):
•
Price:
85%
•
Sales and special deals:
75%
•
Convenience of location:
60%
•
Ease of shopping:
60%
•
Customer service:
56%
    _________________________________________________________________
“Price trumps sales and special deals, customer
service, and convenience as a factor in deciding
where to shop for the majority of U.S. consumers. 
Eighty-five percent of consumers say the price
needs to be right before they shop.”
     The NPD Group
    _________________________________________________________________
Retailers must strike a balance between offering prices that are attractive to
customers, yet still provide themselves with a reasonable margin.  Underpricing can
drastically cut into a company’s bottom line.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  218  •

   _________________________________________________________________
“Companies leave millions of dollars on the
table every year through sub-optimal pricing
practices.  The current abundance of customer
data, in the context of increased global
competition and the instant information sharing
made possible by the Internet, requires
companies to not only set the right prices, but
to continually monitor and refine pricing.”
        UC Berkeley Pricing for Profitability
    _________________________________________________________________
37.2  Dynamic Pricing
Dynamic pricing, also called market-based pricing and variable pricing, adjusts
prices based on demand.  It was introduced by airlines in the 1980s when carriers
began shifting capacity by offering discounts on full fare prices.  Most travelers today
are aware that fares fluctuate with demand.
The dynamic pricing model is also popular in professional sports ticketing.  Most
MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL teams adjust single-game ticket prices – up or down – as
late as game day.  Software by Digonex Technologies (www.digonex.com), Qcue
(www.qcue.com), and Veritix (www.veritix.com) is used by teams to guide variable
pricing based on past ticket sales, team matchups, day and time of the game, player
injuries, weather, and the going rate on ticket resale websites.  Qcue reported that its
MLB clients that implemented dynamic pricing increased season revenue by an
average of $900,000 by adjusting the price in each section of the ballpark for each
game.
Dynamic pricing is also practiced in the retail sector.  Many online retailers have
regularly adjusted prices on a daily basis for several years.  Bricks-and-mortar retailers
have recently caught up by using electronic shelf tags.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  219  •

   _________________________________________________________________
“Dynamic pricing may be the future of retail.  The
retail industry, following in the footsteps of
travel and hospitality, knows that real-time price
shifts online will not only buffer against
showrooming – shoppers can’t rely on prices
online to be cheaper or quantities more
abundant – but also maximize revenues.  Prices
rise and fall based on customer traffic, demand,
weather, the time of day, loyalty card data, and
more.”

37.3  Price-Matching
While not a new practice, price-matching has increased since 2011, when
Walmart rolled out its Ad Match Guarantee.  Big-box retailers Best Buy, Home Depot,
Target, and Toys “R” Us, among others, also use price-matching programs to better
compete with rivals.  
While retailers dislike price-matching, once one retailer offers to do it, rivals feel
compelled to follow.  Because price equivalencies are not always simple to ascertain,
matching policies vary.  Best Buy, for instance, lets customers match prices if the rival
store is within a 25-mile radius, while Walmart lets store managers decide how far and
wide price-matching applies. 
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  220  •

    _________________________________________________________________
“Price-matching is a necessary evil today. 
Although price-matching promotions have been
around for years, they’ve become a key
marketing tool to attract shoppers squeezed by
stagnant wages and 7%-plus unemployment.  It
can be a risky strategy.  Not only are the
programs hard to manage, they’re often left to
the discretion of an individual cashier.  Price-
matching can backfire if shoppers don’t get the
deal they expect and leave confused or angry.”
 Bloomberg Businessweek
    _________________________________________________________________
An assessment by DealScience (www.dealscience.com), a company that ranks
online deals from thousands of retail brands, discovered that at least 20% of big-box
retailers had price-matching policies, though many do not advertise them.  The practice
is commonplace for home and sporting goods and electronics retailers, but even higher-
end merchants like Nordstrom have price-matching guidelines.  Some retailers,
including Best Buy, Home Depot, and Lowe’s allow managers to go a step better 
than price matching by offering 10% below a competitor’s price.
Recognizing that their strongest competition is online retailers, not nearby stores,
some retailers have expanded their price-matching.  During the 2013 holiday season,
for example, Best Buy matched the prices of any online competitor if customers showed
proof of the lower price.  With such bold policies, price-matching morphed into pricing
negotiations with customers.
The New York Times reported that when a shopper asked at Nordstrom and
Bloomingdale’s if the retailers were open to bargaining, sales representatives and
managers at both stores said yes without hesitation.  And, at Kohl’s, when a shopper
asked for a 15% discount, the answer was yes.

“Armed with increasingly sophisticated price-
tracking tools on their smartphones and other
devices, consumers have become bolder, and
they know that they often have the upper hand
during a tough season for retailers.  Recognizing
the new reality, some retailers, desperate for
sales and customer loyalty, have begun training
their employees in the art of bargaining with
customers.”
         The New York Times
    _________________________________________________________________
According to Alison Kenny Paul, vice chairwoman and leader of the retail and
distribution practice at Deloitte (www.deloitte.com), some retailers are training
employees on the rules of bargaining.  While it is mainly department or floor managers
who are given the authority to make deals, other employees are now being coached to
recognize when a consumer needs to negotiate and to spot the consumer getting ready
to walk out the door.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Retailers panicked a few years ago when they
realized that some consumers were using
bricks-and-mortar stores to view products, only
to walk out and order them at a lower price
online.  Now they are trying to ‘turn lemons into
lemonade’ by using that model as an
opportunity to work with customers and even
cement their loyalty.”

37.4  Personalized Pricing
Using customers’ buying profiles, either from their online purchase history or
loyalty program in-store purchases, retailers are able to make intelligent guesses about
what customers will want to buy next, when they will want it, and how much they will be
willing to pay.  Retailers, particularly in the supermarket sector, are using customers’
buying history logged with their loyalty program purchases to customize coupon
promotions for individuals.  Promotions are then tailored to the customer profiles.
    _________________________________________________________________
“For the past decade, e-commerce sites have
altered prices based on your Web habits and
personal attributes.  What is your geography
and your past buying history?  How did you
arrive at the e-commerce site?  What time of day
are you visiting?  An entire literature has
emerged on the ethics, legality and economic
promise of pricing optimization.”
            Scientific American
    _________________________________________________________________
Supermarkets offer personalized prices via smartphone apps and loyalty card
swipes.  A mobile app identifies shoppers when they scan products through their
frequent shopper number or phone number and creates special e-coupons on the spot. 
The apps also use a shopper’s location in store aisles to personalize offers. 
    _________________________________________________________________
“As more supermarkets experiment with
personalized pricing, the more likely it becomes
that you and the shopper standing next to you
will pay two different prices for the same quart
of milk.  Same store, same milk, different
prices.”

A survey by RetailWire (www.retailwire.com) found that marketers rank
personalized pricing/promotion as the #1 pricing strategy in combating problems
caused by pricing transparency.
37.5  Pricing Market Research
Market research companies offer two general types of pricing studies: those
which determine acceptance of a product or service sold at a specified price, and those
which determine the possible effect on demand of different price levels (i.e., elasticity).
A directory of companies that provide pricing consulting studies is available
online at www.greenbook.org/market-research-firms/price-research.

PRIVACY ISSUES
38.1  Overview
Consumers are increasingly reacting to the continuous invasion of privacy in their
lives.  They feel, rightfully, that marketers are watching virtually every aspect of their
lives, even while they are in their own homes. 
    _________________________________________________________________
“A surveillance society is taking root.  Video
cameras peer constantly from lamp poles and
storefronts.  Smartphones relay a dizzying
barrage of information about their owners to
sentinel towers dotting cities and punctuating
pasture-land.  Meanwhile, on the information
superhighway, every stop by every traveler is
noted and stored by Internet service providers
like Google, Verizon, and Comcast.  Retailers
scan, remember, and analyze each purchase by
every consumer.  Smart TVs know what we’re
watching – soon they will have eyes to watch us
watching them – and smart meters know if
we’ve turned out the lights.”
           Time
    _________________________________________________________________
General surveys indicate that consumers have concerns about their privacy, both
online and offline.  However, it is difficult to ascertain their concerns about specific
actions by marketers because few people really understand what these activities are. 
And there is a general misconception that the government is protecting their privacy.

    _________________________________________________________________
“My national phone surveys going back to 1999
show that the majority of Americans know
companies follow them, but they have little
understanding of data mining or targeting.  They
also think the government protects them more
than it does regarding the misuse of their
information and against price discrimination.”
     Prof. Joseph Turow, Ph.D., Associate Dean
     Annenberg School For Communication
     University of Pennsylvania
    _________________________________________________________________
Consumers’ concerns about privacy are also sometimes difficult to gauge
because they are self-contradictory about marketer’s use of their information.
    _________________________________________________________________
“People may claim to worry about privacy issues
but look at what they actually do online ... willingly
surrendering personal information for a coupon or
in a Facebook discussion.  The disconnect
between what people say and do shows that
policymakers and academics misjudge the extent
to which the public really cares about the use of
data about them by marketers.”

38.2  Identity Fraud and Theft
According to the 2016 Identity Fraud Study, by Javelin Strategy & Research
(www.javelinstrategy.com), 13.1 million consumers were identity fraud victims in 2015, a
3% increase over the prior year.  The amount stolen decreased by 6% to $15 billion.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  226  •

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (www.bjs.gov) classifies Identity theft as follows:
•
Misuse of an existing account such as a credit card 
or online account:
86% of incidents
•
Unauthorized use of personal information to open a new account:
  4% of incidents
•
Misuse of personal information for fraudulent purposes such 
as getting medical care, housing, a job, or other benefits:
  3% of incidents
•
Multiple types of theft:
  7% of incidents
In 2015, the U.S. switched to EMV, an open-standard set of specifications for
smart card payments and acceptance devices which is designed to reduce in-person
fraud and the profitability of counterfeit card operations.  Fraudsters have reacted by
moving away from existing card fraud to focus on new account fraud.  This drove a
113% increase in incidence of new account fraud, which now accounts for 20% of all
fraud losses.
38.3  Attitudes About Privacy
Americans’ Attitudes About Privacy, Security, And Surveillance, a 2015 report by

    _________________________________________________________________
“The majority of Americans believe it is important
that they be able to maintain privacy and
confidentiality in commonplace activities of their
lives.  Most strikingly, these views are especially
pronounced when it comes to knowing what
information about them is being collected and
who is doing the collecting.  These feelings also
extend to their wishes that they be able to
maintain privacy in their homes, at work, during
social gatherings, at times when they want to be
alone and when they are moving around in
public.”

of how revealing their mobile data – including

“There’s not a weekend where an average
specialty retailer in the mall is not offering some
kind of 30% to 40% off deal.  It certainly feels
like the consumer is not shopping unless
there’s some kind of deal attached to it.  And it’s
very hard to pull back when the consumer gets
used to buying things on sale.”

discounts or price promotions accounts for approximately 50% of impulse purchases.
Unity Marketing (www.unitymarketingonline.com) found buying on impulse is an
important factor in discretionary purchases for approximately 40% of consumers.

“If shoppers bought only what they needed, few
retailers would remain in business.  Fortunately,
impulse buying is a way of life for many
consumers.”
     Chain Store Age
    ______________________________________________________________
A survey by Gallup (www.gallup.com) reported the following percentages of
consumers had made impulse purchases in the prior month:
•
Millennials:
42%
•
Generation Xers:
40%
•
Baby Boomers:
39%
In a 2015 survey by Chase (www.chase.com), 83% of Millennials said they had
made an impulse purchase.  This was especially likely on payday or when they were
cruising shopping websites online.  In those instances, their urge to purchase items on
impulse alone exceeded that of other age groups.
Male Millennial shoppers make slightly fewer impulse purchases than females. 
When they shop impulsively, 50% of men said they were likely to spend on electronics,
compared with only 27% of female shoppers.  For female shoppers, 61% said their
impulse buys were mostly clothing, while only 43% of men said clothing lured them to
impulse shopping.  Twenty percent (20%) of female shoppers cited “retail therapy” – the
comfort and relief that comes from purchasing something new after a particularly trying
day or event – as a primary reason for impulsive shopping, compared with 9% of males. 
Seven in 10 women have made impulse purchases after seeing price promotions; 60%
of men have done so.

“Just because Millennials make impulse
purchases doesn’t mean they feel good about it. 
Chase found that Millennials were more likely to
express regret or dissatisfaction after an
impulse purchase.  Others more attuned to their
impulsive spending habits tried to stay away
from shopping altogether when they were
emotional to avoid the risk of buying.”

39.8  Checkout
According to a 2015 survey by CFI Group (www.cfigroup.com), the checkout
process is the No. 1 driver of customer satisfaction with retailers, at 28%, ahead of
price, at 26%.  Sixty-five percent (65%) of adults report having used self-checkout
registers at the front of a retail store.
In a 2015 Harris Poll, 29% of adults cited slow checkout as a major source of
frustration when shopping at retail establishments; 21% find long lines problematic.

39.9  Brand Engagement
Brands face a major challenge when trying to increase customer engagement:
Consumers are busy and spend little time ‘engaging’ with brands while shopping. 
According to a 2015 study by the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute of Marketing Science
(www.marketingscience.info), the average consumer spends 13 seconds purchasing a
brand in-store.  Online, the average consumer spends 19 seconds purchasing, and the
majority spend less than 10 seconds.

    _________________________________________________________________
“The idea that consumers ‘engage’ with brands is
no doubt true for a small set of consumers and a
small set of high involvement categories and
brands, but for the vast majority of brands,
consumers are not engaged to or with brands. 
They’re just buying them.  The simple truth is this:
For most categories, consumers have a small
repertoire of brands that are acceptable, and they
spend little time thinking about purchase
decisions.  Their lives are already full of spouses,
kids, events and other activities, and most people
simply don’t have the time or energy to engage
with brands in any meaningful way.”

39.10  Buying Direct From Brands
The 2015 Consumer Preferences Survey, by BrandShop (www.brandshop.com),
found that 82% of online shoppers would prefer to have the option of buying direct from
brands or an online retailer.  Given the option, 88% would buy direct from the brand.
    _________________________________________________________________
“While most purchases take place over third
party channels, it is now understood that
consumers prefer to buy directly from a brand 
if given the option.  The confidence and
authenticity a consumer experiences from
transacting directly with a brand is not easily
replicated by third parties.”

Airlines
An assessment by Forbes found airline quality ratings (i.e., on-time arrivals,
denied boardings, mishandled baggage, and customer complaints) do not seem to
influence revenue.

“Rude flight attendants, delayed arrivals, stale
meals.  Frequent flyers have plenty to gripe
about.  But does better customer service actually
sell more tickets?  Apparent correlation: zero.”

Drugstores and Pharmacies
The National Pharmacy Study, conducted by J.D. Power and Associates
(www.jdpower.com), found customer service, not price, was most important among
consumers with respect to store loyalty at drugstores and pharmacies.
E-Commerce
Customer service ranks low among attributes most important to online shoppers. 
In a survey by A.T. Kearney (www.atkearney.com), the ability to find specific products,
free shipping, finding favorite brands, best prices, ease of navigation, site security,
special promotions, free samples, peer reviews, and the availability of new products all
ranked above customer service.
Still, many online shoppers do expect some level of customer service.  In a
survey by OneUpWeb (www.oneupweb.com), 32% of Internet users said they expect
live chat.  A survey by comScore (www.comscore.com) found 35% of online shoppers
would like online retailers to improve the availability of live customer service.
Restaurants
Emphatica (www.empathica.com) found that 20% of consumers value good
service over good food at fine- and casual-dining establishments. 
A Gallup Poll (www.gallup.com) found that the biggest driver of engagement in a
fast-food restaurant is being treated as a valued customer.  Warmth of the greeting
ranked second in the survey; taste of food ranked third.  Gallup found that a fully

“According to a study by YouGov, consumers
don’t write online reviews to release anger.
Instead, among U.S. Internet users who posted
online customer reviews, the top reason for
doing so was to help others make better
purchasing decisions.”

42.4  Travel Reviews
Among all product and service categories, travel reviews are the most used by
consumers.
According to Forrester Research (www.forrester.com), approximately one-third of
travelers who research trips via the Internet read reviews.  Of those who book hotels
online, a third have changed plans based on other travelers’ comments. 
Expedia-owned TripAdvisor (www.tripadvisor.com), the largest online travel
review site, had posted more than 320 million consumer reviews of hotels, attractions,
and restaurants across the globe as of April 2016.  The site has 350 million unique
monthly visitors, according to comScore (www.comscore.com).
42.5  Consumer Electronics Reviews
Among all product and service categories, consumer electronics (CE) reviews
are the second most used by consumers.
A survey by Weber Shandwick (www.webershandwick.com) found that
consumers seek out opinions about consumer electronics products they are considering
as follows:
•
Search for reviews online:
74%
•
Ask someone their opinion:
66%
•
Read ‘likes’ or recommendations on a social networking site:
47%
•
Watch an online video with someone’s experiences:
37%
•
Ask their social network friends or followers:
28%
Seventy-two percent (72%) conduct at least two of these activities.
Among those who use online reviews, 65% have been inspired enough by a
favorable consumer review to buy a CE product they weren’t considering, and 59%
have been similarly inspired by a professional review.

Among those using consumer reviews, 95% report gaining confidence in a
purchase decision; 86% have gained confidence because of professional reviews.
Comparing consumer and professional reviews, 77% of consumers say they pay
more attention to professional reviews; 23% give preference to professional reviews.
Eighty percent (80%) of those who use reviews say they have had concerns
about authenticity.  Specific concerns are as follows (percentage of respondents):
•
A positive review may be posted by the manufacturer’s employee
or agent, not an actual consumer:

RESPONSE TO VISUALS
43.1  Overview
Visual content can have a major influence on consumer behavior.  From studying
brain scans and tracking eye movements, researchers have discovered that visual
content is simply processed differently than text.  Visuals communicate more
information, more effectively.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Processing print isn’t something the human
brain was built for.  The printed word is a
human artifact.  It’s very convenient and it’s
worked very well for us for 5,000 years, but it’s
an invention of human beings.  By contrast
Mother Nature has built into our brain our ability
to see the visual world and interpret it.  Even the
spoken language is much more a given
biologically than reading written language.”
       Prof. Marcel Just, Ph.D., Director
       Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging
       Carnegie Mellon University
       Center for Media Research, 1/28/16
    _________________________________________________________________
43.2  Response to Visuals
A study by Nate Birt, a researcher at University of Missouri-Columbia, published
in Content Marketing in June 2015, reported the following findings:
•
Ninety percent (90%) of the information transmitted to the brain is visual.
•
Visual content generates 94% more views.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  252  •

•
Tweets with images get 150% more retweets, 18% more clicks, and 89% more
favorites.
•
People retain 80% of what they see, 20% of what they read, and 10% of what they
hear.
•
Visuals are processed 60,000 times faster than text.
•
Eighty percent (80%) of the text on most pages does not get read.
43.3  Eye Tracking
A January 2016 report by Eye Faster (www.eyefaster.com) provides the following
finding of eye-tracking research:
•
The human eye constantly scans the scene, moving abruptly in “saccades” lasting
20 to 40 microseconds, with in between ‘fixations,’ (still periods) of 100 to 400
microseconds.  Since the brain processes visual information after the eyes fixate for
200 microseconds, over a half-hour shopping trip, says the report, a customer’s
eyes fixate 1,800 times.  That provides marketing messages between 200
microseconds and one second to communicate.
•
The eyes focus on a small window, so everything in one’s peripheral vision is a blur. 
As a result, products that are near eye level in a retail store are much more likely to
be seen than those placed on high or low shelves.  The ideal product placement is
from 30E below eye level to 10E above.
•
Being used to reading left to right and up to down, message that are not displayed in
that order feel confusing and off-putting.  Consumers have trouble with vertical
lettering and text in unusual places.  The rule of design for visuals is that they should
not get so fancy with the design that the message disappears.
•
Shoppers give some products more visual consideration than others.  One example
is packaged salads.  In one study, people picked up and considered three bags of
package salad for every one bag purchased.  But salad dressing hardly merits any
consideration at all.  In another study, the average shopper spent 62 seconds
looking at salad dressing and only noticed 7% of the available products.
•
When shoppers look for known brands, products that look similar to the categories’
leading brand are more likely to catch a customers’ eye than those that look
completely different.  If a product doesn’t match the category look and feel, it is
unlikely to register as an option.
•
A brand may be of higher quality or be less expensive than the competition, but if it
doesn’t give consumers a positive feeling, they won’t buy it.  Since the majority of
purchase decisions are made on the subconscious level where feelings rule,
emotional factors like shape, color, and the memories a package provokes are of
the utmost importance.

“Most consumers cannot readily explain why
they sample a new product or regularly
purchase one particular brand, but the truth can
be discovered in their eyes.  From numerous
eye-tracking studies surprising insights emerge
into why customers buy some products while
walking right past others.”

43.4  Response to Color
Color psychology studies emotions and reactions of people to colors.  Research
in the field has found that people react differently to certain colors and that these colors
elicit different emotional states, behaviors, and moods.  Using colors that are
appropriate in marketing can be important in eliciting a desired consumer behavior.
The following are emotions and meanings that have been found to correspond
with certain colors among consumers in the North American culture (source: MyeVideo

•
Black:
sophistication, elegance, mystery
•
Blue:

“Did you ever walk into a store only to discover
that it wasn’t a store but actually a restaurant? 
We tend to associate colors to certain things.  If
you’re going to a pharmacy, you expect it to be
white.  A kindergarten not so much.  If you know
that red encourages action, you might want use
it on your retail website because red encourages
shoppers to take advantage of your offers.  If you
are creating a video about all-natural herbal
remedies, it would make sense that you use a lot
of green.  It would be a complete miss if you
used, let’s say, purple, since purple is such a
rare color in nature.  Have you noticed that fast
food restaurants are mostly yellow, red, or
orange?  It’s no wonder that these particular
colors are so dominant in these places.  They
encourage visitors to eat faster and then leave,
which is the real reason why these kinds of
restaurants exist.  Have you noticed that toys,
books, or websites for kids are usually adorned
with pastel and primary colors?  The reason is
that small children love these colors and they
react to them more positively than to other
combinations of stronger colors.”

44.4  Research Via Mobile Devices
The New Digital Divide, a report by Deloitte (www.deloitte.com), found that the
use of mobile devices before or during in-store shopping trips influences approximately
$593 billion of in-store retail sales, or 19% of total bricks-and-mortar sales.
According to a December 2015 study by Y&R (www.yr.com), 51% of adults

The Consumer Technology Association (CTA; www.cta.tech) reported that 58%
of shoppers prefer to look up information on their mobile devices while shopping in
stores, rather than talk to a salesperson.  Shoppers ages 25-to-44 and men are most
likely to prefer to access their device for product information.  Nearly two-thirds feel that
the information they gather on their mobile devices is more helpful than in-store
information from product displays or sales literature.

SPENDING FOR GOODS VS. EXPERIENCES
45.1  A Shift From Goods To Experiences
As some consumers are beginning to realize they have all the material things
they need, many are shifting their interests toward seeking new experiences.  This is
especially true for older consumers who have been accumulating all their lives.
    _________________________________________________________________
“With the attitude of ‘been there, done that’ in
buying more things, Boomers will turn away
from a focus on consuming things, to a hunger
for experiences and personal development. 
Service industries that satisfy the mature
Boomers’ craving for personal enhancement
will fare well.  These include travel providers,
especially adventure travel modified for aging
Boomers’ health and fitness levels; health and
beauty spas; and colleges and adult-education
experiences, including training such as cooking
or language schools.”
Pamela N. Danziger, CEO
Unity Marketing
    _________________________________________________________________
 
Favoring experiences over goods extends across generations.  When asked
“which is more important for you personally” in a survey by Zipcar (www.zipcar.com),
61% of 18-to-34 year-olds picked “experiences” over “possessions.”  A nearly identical
proportion of older respondents responded similarly.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  259  •

    _________________________________________________________________
“A familiar refrain is that Millennials would
rather spend on experiences than on acquiring
“stuff.”  A related theme states that they care
more about access to goods than ownership of
them.  A report by The Intelligence Group called
young people “the first generations of NOwners,
or those who prize access over ownership.”
     eMarketer
    _________________________________________________________________
45.2  Purchase Satisfaction
In their book Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending (Simon &
Schuster), authors Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton draw on years of quantitative
and qualitative research to present five principles that can make spending a rewarding
experience for consumers.  The principle Buy Experiences shows material purchases
being less satisfying than experiences such as vacations or concerts.
    _________________________________________________________________
“One of the most common things people do
with their money is get stuff.  But we have
shown … in research that stuff isn’t good for
you.  It doesn’t make you unhappy, but it
doesn’t make you happy.  But one thing that
does make us happy is an experience.”

45.3  Research Findings
Studies at Cornell University and Harvard University have found favorable
consumer response to purchases of experiences over material goods.  Research by
Thomas D. Gilovich, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Cornell University, and his
colleagues suggests that when people spend for an experience such as a trip, they are
likely to feel better about that purchase in the long run versus spending the same
amount on clothes.  
In one study, Dr. Gilovich examined the uniqueness of objects and experiences. 
He found that a major reason why people regret buying objects is that after they own
the object, they can continue to compare it to other objects that are available.  When
they buy a computer, for instance, they may regret the purchase when they find another
one that is faster, smaller, and cheaper.  When they go on a vacation, though, that
experience is relatively unique.  It is hard to compare a particular trip with other trips
they might have taken, so they spend less time comparing the experience to other
things they might have done. 
Research by Daniel Gilbert, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Harvard
University, has also found that spending on experiences is more rewarding than
spending on goods.  One of the reasons is that experiences can be shared.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Happiness, for most people not named Sartre,
is other people; and experiences are usually
shared – first when they happen and then again
and again when we tell our friends.”
Prof. Daniel Gilbert, Ph.D.
Harvard University
    _________________________________________________________________
While the memories of experiences can endure, objects generally wear out their
welcome, according to Dr. Gilbert, who provides the following example:  “If you really
love a rug, you might buy it.  The first few times you see, you might admire it, and feel
happy.  But over time, it will probably reveal itself to be just a rug.”  Psychologists call
this habituation, economists call it declining marginal utility.

AFFLUENCE PROFILE
47.1  Overview
Consumers that comprise the luxury marketplace are typically categorized as
follows:
•
Upper-class:
Top 20% of U.S. households
•
Affluent:
Top 10% of U.S. households
•
Wealthy:
Top 1% of U.S. households
•
Rich:
Top 0.1% of U.S. households
•
Ultra-rich:
Top 0.01% of U.S. households
47.2  Upper-Class Consumers
The upper-class is typically defined as the highest quintile of households, or the
top 20% of U.S. households.
A 2015 study by Edward N. Wolff, Ph.D., an economist at New York University,
reported the highest quintile control 88% of wealth in the United States.
The Census Bureau reported the median net worth of the highest quintile is
$630,754.  The median wealth of the highest quintile of households by age of
householder is as follows:
•
Under 35: 
$153,616
•

47.3  Affluent Consumers
The wealthiest 10% of U.S. households are typically dubbed ‘affluent.’  The
September 2014 Federal Reserve Bulletin put the total number of those millionaire
households at 11.53 million.  That makes virtually everyone in the top 10% of U.S.
households a millionaire.
The top 10% of households hold 76% of wealth and the top 5% hold 62%,
according to Dr. Wolff.
The top 10% of households, excluding the top 1%, controlled 34.6% of U.S.

wealth in 2013.
Affluent consumers saw their wealth increase in the aftermath of the Great
Recession.  The Federal Reserve Bulletin reported that the share of total income of the
top 3% of Americans grew to 30.5% in 2013 from 27.7% in 2010.  The top 3% saw their
share of wealth rise from 44.8% in 1989 to 54.4% in 2013.  The next 7%, who are
wealthier than 90% of the rest of the nation, had a minimum net worth of $941,700 in
2013.  
Excluding the high-net-worth households, or the upper 1%, the affluent market is
comprised primarily of people who are careful spenders and aggressive savers.  They
are generally not conspicuous or ostentatious consumers. 
47.4  Wealthy Consumers
The top 1% of U.S. households are typically characterized as wealthy.  There are
1.1 million households in this category.
These consumers have the following profile (source: American Affluence
Research Center [www.affluenceresearch.org]):
•
With an average annual income of $982,000, they earn about 14% of the total
income earned by all American households.
•
They account for about 20% of all consumer spending.
•
They have a minimum net worth of $6 million.
•
With an average net worth of $15.3 million, they control 39.8% of the total wealth
among U.S. households.
Dr. Wolff reports that the top 1% control 35% of wealth in the U.S.
47.5  Rich and Ultra-rich Consumers
The top 0.1% of households, excluding the top 0.01%, control 10.4% of U.S.
wealth; there are 100,000 households in this category.  The threshold for being in the
top 0.1% is wealth of about $20 million.
The top 0.01% of households control 11.1% of U.S. wealth.  The 16,000 families
in this category, often dubbed the ‘ultra-rich,’ possess $6 trillion in assets, equal to the
total wealth of the bottom two-thirds of American families.  The threshold for being in
the top 0.01% is wealth of about $100 million.
47.6  Spending By High-Net-Worth Households
The Affluent Barometer by Ipsos (www.ipsos-na.com) assessed annual spending
by affluent consumers as follows:
•
Automotive:
$398 billion (20% of total)

Luxury brand companies must take an entirely different approach when selling 
to the high-net-worth spender because they are a different breed from the general
affluent consumer.  They spend freely, and they spend frequently and extravagantly. 
They not only have the interest and the resources to purchase exclusive, expensive
items, but their wealth – and often fame – adds a level of distinction to the luxury
brands they are buying.  It is becoming harder for the super-rich to differentiate
themselves, and many of them go to greater lengths to make the statement that they
are successful.  Further, the ‘massification’ of luxury drives them to consume and
splurge even more.
The New Jet Set, a report by Elite Traveler, included a survey of 661 high-net-
worth individuals who own private jets.  Participants in the survey, which was conducted
by Prince & Associates (www.russalanprince.com), had an average income of $9.2
million and a net worth of $89.3 million.  The following was average annual spending by
this group for luxury goods:

“The thing that surprises me about the survey is
the depth of their pockets.  These folks don’t
make financial decisions when making a luxury
purchase.  For them, it’s like me going to
Starbucks.”
Doug Gollan, Editor-in-Chief

AFFLUENT E-COMMERCE
49.1  Shopping Channels of the Affluent
According to the Shullman Research Center (www.shullman.net), 51% of affluent
consumers purchase luxury items online.  For comparison, 87% make such purchases
in retail stores.  Among those who make high-end purchases online, most do so using
laptop or desktop computers; use of smartphones and tablets is cited by only 10% and
7%, respectively.
Approximately half of affluent consumers say they do not always feel
comfortable shopping via the Internet.  Forty percent (40%) say they do not like using
smartphones to buy, 21% say they feel the same way about tablets, and 8% don’t feel
comfortable shopping by computer.  For comparison, 25% do not like shopping by
phone or by mail order, and 10% are uncomfortable buying in stores.
Among affluents who shop online, 40% say convenience is the primary reason
they do so; 19% cite price as the primary reason.
Forty-three percent (43%) of adults with household incomes of $500,000 or
above say they do not buy online at all.

PART VII:  MIDDLE-CLASS CONSUMERS
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  280  •

51
DEFINING THE MIDDLE CLASS
51.1  Income-Based Definitions
The middle class is typically defined as households in the middle three quintiles
(i.e., incomes in the 20th percentile to 80th percentile range).  In 2014, this included
households with incomes between $21,432 and $112,262.  With this definition, the
middle class is always the middle 60% of households ranked by income.
Pew Research Center (www.pewresearch.org) defines middle-income adults as
those that live in households with incomes two-thirds to double the national median
size-adjusted household income, about $42,000 to $125,000 annually in 2014 for a
three-person household.  Lower-income households have incomes less than two-thirds
of the median, and upper-income households have incomes that are more than double
the median.  Household incomes are adjusted for the cost of living in metropolitan
areas.  With this definition, the middle class varies as the income distribution in the U.S.
shifts.  As discussed in Chapter 52 of this handbook, the size of the middle class in the
U.S. has been dropping for several years and continues to decline.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Today’s economy has been called rigged
against the middle class.  During the recovery
from the 2008 recession, income increased 
31% for the top 1% buy just 0.4% for 99% of
Americans.”
       Time, 5/30/16
    _________________________________________________________________
51.2  Self-Identification As Middle Class
A study by the Congressional Research Service (CRS, www.loc.gov/crsinfo/)
recognizes that the middle class can be defined as a psychological perception, or the
self assessment of one’s financial situation compared with those around them. Other
studies have found a strong link between relative income and self-reported happiness.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  281  •

Pew Research Center found in 2015 that nearly 90% of adults considered
themselves middle class, regardless of whether their incomes languished near the
poverty line or skimmed the top stratum of earners.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Middle income is not necessarily the same
thing as middle class.  Even as the proportion of
households in the middle-income brackets has
narrowed, people’s identification with the
middle class remains broad.  It’s not only what
you have, but how you feel.  The middle-class
label is as much about aspirations among
Americans as it is about economics.”
      The New York Times, 4/11/15
    _________________________________________________________________
The traditional bedrocks of a middle-class life are adequate housing and health
care, college for the children plus retirement savings, generally with a personal vehicle,
and a regular summer vacation.  And even though consumption was once a useful
shorthand guide to a middle-class lifestyle, it is no longer as reliable in a world where
smartphones and flat-screen TVs are staples in a majority of households below the
poverty line and retirement savings, even among top earners, are often treated as a
luxury.
Ultimately, what people need to feel part of the middle class is a sense of
economic security, according to Thomas Hirschl, Ph.D., a sociologist at Cornell
University and co-author of Chasing the American Dream.

MIDDLE CLASS FALLING BEHIND
52.1  Trend Assessment
A May 2016 study by Pew Research Center (www.pewresearch.org) assessed
the current economic profiles of major metropolitan areas (see Chapter 88 of this
handbook) and compared this data with economic profiles of 2000.  Findings were as
follows:
•
Decrease in share of households that are middle income:
89% of metros
•
Increase in share of households that are upper income:
75% of metros
•
Increase in share of households that are lower income:
70% of metros
    _________________________________________________________________
“The American middle class is losing ground in
metropolitan areas across the country, affecting
communities from Boston to Seattle and from
Dallas to Milwaukee.”
    Pew Research Center, 5/11/16
    _________________________________________________________________
52.2  Decline Of Middle-Income Households
“Middle-income” households are defined by Pew Research Center as those with
an income that is two-thirds to double that of the U.S. median household income, after
incomes have been adjusted for household size.  For a three-person household, the
middle-income range was about $42,000 to $125,000 annually in 2014.  Lower-income
households have incomes less than two-thirds of the median, and upper-income
households have incomes that are more than double the median.
In 1970, 61% of U.S. households were middle-income.  By 2015, the share of
households in the middle-income tier dropped to 50%.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  283  •

    _________________________________________________________________
“After more than four decades of serving as the
nation’s economic majority, the American
middle class is now matched in number by
those in the economic tiers above and below it.”
    Pew Research Center, 12/9/15
    _________________________________________________________________
Forty-nine percent (49%) of U.S. aggregate income went to upper-income
households in 2014, up from 29% in 1970.  The share accruing to middle-income
households was 43% in 2014, down substantially from 62% in 1970.
Middle-income Americans have fallen further behind financially in the 21st
century.  In 2014, the median income of these households was 4% less than in 2000.
Moreover, because of the housing market crisis and the Great Recession, their median
wealth (assets minus debts) fell by 28% from 2001 to 2013.
52.3  Decline In Wealth
Pew Research Center assesses that the wealth (assets minus debts) of upper-
income households more than doubled over the span of 30 years from 1983 to 2013
while the wealth of middle-income households dropped.
Before the onset of the Great Recession, the median wealth of middle-income
families increased from $95,879 in 1983 to $161,050 in 2007, a gain of 68%.  But the
economic downturn eliminated that gain almost entirely.
By 2010, the median wealth of middle-income families had fallen to about $98,000,
where it still stood in 2013.  Upper-income families more than doubled their wealth from
1983 to 2007 as it climbed from $323,402 to $729,980.  Despite losses during the
recession, these families recovered somewhat since 2010 and had a median wealth of
$650,074 in 2013, more than double their wealth in 1983.
52.4  Demographic Shifts
The less-educated, younger, married-with-children, and Caucasian households
have lost the largest share of middle-income households.
The following is a comparison of demographics of middle-income adults in 2015
with all U.S. households and 30-year (1971-2015) change in share by each
demographic (source: Pew Research Center):

INCOME & WEALTH INEQUALITY
53.1  Overview
In a speech on economic mobility, President Barack Obama called income
inequality and lack of upward mobility the defining challenge of our times.
The Great Recession widened the gap between the wealthy and the rest of the
U.S. population. 
An ongoing assessment of income distribution at the University of California,
Berkeley found that the richest 1% in America secured 19% of national income in 2012,
their biggest share since 1928.  The top 10% of earners held a record 48.2%.  During
the recovery between 2009 and 2012, real-family incomes rose by an average of 4.6%,
though this was skewed by a 31.4% increase for the top 1%.  For the other 99%
incomes rose by just 0.4%.
According to Robert Reich, Ph.D., an economics professor at University of
California, Berkeley and author of Inequality For All (2013, 72 Productions), the average
male U.S. worker in 1978 earned $48,000, adjusted for inflation, while the average
member of the Upper One Percent earned $390,000, or eight times as much.  By 2010,
the middle-class male’s wages had declined to $33,000, while the One Percenter was
making $1.1 million, or 33 times more.  Prof. Reich says that the wealthiest 400 people
in the U.S. today have more money than the bottom 150 million Americans combined.
53.2  Economic Inequality Assessment
A 2015 study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD, www.oecd.org) reported that the richest 10% of American households earns
about 28% of the overall income pie, roughly consistent with what you see among the
rich in other countries.  The wealthiest 10% of U.S. households have garnered 76% of
wealth in the U.S., significantly higher than in most other affluent countries.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018

    _________________________________________________________________
“When we think about and discuss economic
inequality in this country, we usually focus on
income inequality.  But there's another type of
inequality that gets a lot less attention.  It
arguably contributes far more to the divide
between the haves and have-nots in this
country: wealth inequality.”
     The Washington Post, 5/21/15
    _________________________________________________________________
The OECD, a group of 34 mostly developed economies, calculates Gini
coefficients for most of its member countries, both before and after taxes and transfer
payments, to assess economic inequalities.  Before accounting for taxes and transfers,
the U.S. ranks 10th in income inequality; among the countries with more unequal income
distributions are France, the U.K., and Ireland.  But after taking taxes and transfers into
account, the U.S. had the second-highest level of inequality, behind only Chile.
53.3  Analysis For Major U.S. Cities
A study by the Brookings Institution (www.brookings.edu) assessed inequality in
the 50 largest U.S. cities using the “95/20 ratio.”  This figure represents the income at
which a household earns more than 95% of all other households, divided by the income
at which a household earns more than only 20% of all other households.  Using Census
Bureau data, Brookings found across the 50 largest U.S. cities the 95/20 ratio was 10.8,
compared to 9.1 for the country as a whole.  The 95/20 ratio ranged from 18.8 to 6.0
among the largest cities.  Cities with the highest income gap were Atlanta, San
Francisco, and Miami.  
The 95/20 ratios for the 50 largest cities are as follows:

    _________________________________________________________________
“A city where the rich are very rich, and the poor
very poor, is likely to face many difficulties.  It
may struggle to maintain mixed-income school
environments that produce better outcomes for
low-income kids.  It may have too narrow a tax
base from which to sustainably raise the
revenues necessary for essential city services.
And it may fail to produce housing and
neighborhoods accessible to middle-class
workers and families, so that those who move
up or down the income ladder ultimately have
no choice but to move out.”
           Alan Berbe, Senior Fellow
           Brookings Institution

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
58.1  Overview
The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI, www.theacsi.org) is a national
economic indicator of satisfaction with the quality of products and services available to
U.S. household consumers.  Established in 1994, the ACSI produces indices of
customer satisfaction on a 0-100 scale.
The ACSI is based on about 65,000 interviews conducted annually, with 250 to
260 interviews completed per company/agency.  Industry sample sizes vary from 750 to
10,000, depending on the number of measured companies in each industry. 
The ACSI is produced by the Stephen M. Ross Business School at the University
of Michigan (www.bus.umich.edu) in partnership with the American Society for Quality
(www.asq.org) and CFI Group (www.cfigroup.com), a consulting firm.  ForeSee Results
(www.foreseeresults.com) sponsors the e-commerce and e-business measurements.

AFRICAN-AMERICAN CONSUMERS
60.1  Overview
African Americans, also referred to as Black Americans, are Americans who
have total or partial ancestry from any of the native populations of Sub-Saharan Africa,
according to the U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov).  Black Hispanics are generally
not classified as African Americans.
African Americans constitute the third largest racial and ethnic group in the U.S.,
trailing Caucasians and Hispanic Americans.
When asked in a survey by Nielsen (www.nielsen.com) which term is preferable,
44% said they preferred Black, 43% preferred African American, and 11% did not have
a preference.
60.2  Profile
Census 2010 counted 38.9 million people, or 12.6% of the total U.S. population,
of Black- or African-American-only ancestry.  An additional 1.0 million people reported
Black as well as one or more other races in that census.  Combined, there were 42.0
million African Americans, representing 13.6% of the population.
Since 2000, the Black population increased by 17.9%, a rate that is 1.6 times
greater than overall growth.  For comparison, the total U.S. population has increased by
only 11.3% since 2000.
The Black population at mid-year 2016 was 42.9 million, or 13.2% of the total
U.S. population.
The African-American population in the U.S. is distributed by age as follows

A majority of African Americans (55%) reside in the South; 72% live in the central
areas of cities.  A quarter (25%) of African-American households live in suburban
areas.
According to Nielsen, African Americans live in the following housing locales:

According to a 2015 study by Pew Research Center (www.pewresearch.org),
8.7% of the U.S. black population is foreign-born, an increase from 6.7% in 2000, 4.9%
in 1990, and 3.1% in 1980.  Approximately 3.8 million black immigrants live in the U.S.,
more than four times as many as in 1980.

African Americans controlled more disposable personal income than any other
U.S. minority group until 2006, when it was equaled by Hispanic-American buying
power in the United States.  Hispanics actually surpassed Blacks as the nation’s largest
minority group seven years before, based on population counts.  But in terms of
spending power, 2007 marked the first year that Hispanics’ buying power led that of
Blacks.

According to the Selig Center, African Americans spend more than non-Black
households on electricity, phone services, children’s clothing, and footwear.  They also
spend a significantly higher proportion on groceries, housing, natural gas, women’s and
girls clothing, and gasoline.  Blacks and non-Blacks spend about the same proportion
for housekeeping supplies, furniture, floor coverings, appliances, men’s and boys’
clothing, medical supplies, TVs, reading materials, education, tobacco products, and life
insurance.  Compared to non-Blacks, Blacks spend much less of their money on eating
out, alcoholic beverages, household operations, vehicle purchases, health care,
entertainment, and pensions.

ARAB-AMERICAN CONSUMERS
61.1  Overview
Arab Americans constitute an ethnicity made up of several waves of immigrants
from the Arabic-speaking countries of southwestern Asia and North Africa that have
settled in the United States since the 1880s.  Their Arab heritage reflects a culture that
is thousands of years old and includes 23 Arab countries as diverse as Egypt, Lebanon,
Morocco, Yemen, Tunisia, and Palestine.
The U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov) considers anyone who reported
being Algerian, Bahraini, Egyptian, Emirati, Iraqi, Jordanian, Kuwaiti, Lebanese, Libyan,
Moroccan, Omani, Palestinian, Qatari, Saudi Arabian, Syrian, Tunisian, and Yemeni to
be of Arab ancestry.
While the majority of the population of the Arab World is composed of people of
the Muslim faith, 63% of Arab Americans are Christian.  Twenty-four percent (24%) of
Arab Americans are Muslim; 13% are of other faiths or claim no religious affiliation.
According to the Arab American Institute (www.aaiusa.org), 89% of Arab
Americans over age 25 have obtained at least a high school diploma.  More than 45%
have a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to 28% of Americans at large, and 18%
of Arab Americans have a post-graduate degree, which is nearly twice the average
(10%) of non-Arab Americans.
Similar to the national average, about 60% of Arab-American adults are in the
labor force; 5% are unemployed.  Seventy-three percent (73%) percent of working Arab
Americans are employed in managerial, professional, sales, or administrative fields. 
Twelve percent (12%) are government employees.
61.2  Profile
Census 2010 reported 1.52 million Arab Americans, a 27% increase from
Census 2000.  Between 1990 and 2000, the Arab-American population grew 38%,

Between 2005 and year-end 2015, 131,010 immigrant refugees from Iraq and
Syria were accepted into the U.S., according to the United States Citizenship and
Immigration Services (www.uscis.gov).

The Census Bureau reported the median household income for Arab households
in 2010 at $56,433, about $4,500 higher than the median household income of $52,029
for all households in the United States.  Lebanese households had the hig hest median
income ($67,264), while Iraqi and Yemeni households had lower median incomes
($32,075 and $34,667, respectively).

ASIAN-AMERICAN CONSUMERS
62.1  Overview
The U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov) refers to Asian Americans as
persons having ancestry from any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast
Asia, or the Indian subcontinent.  This includes people who indicate their race(s) as
Asian or report entries such as Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Vietnamese, Korean,
Japanese, and other Asian.
62.2  Profile
Census 2010 counted 14.7 million people, or 4.8% of the total U.S. population,
of Asian-only ancestry.  An additional 2.6 million people reported their ethnicity as Asian
as well as one or more other ethnicity.  Combined, 17.3 million Asian Americans were
counted, representing 5.6% of the population.
The Asian-American population at mid-year 2016 was 17.5 million, or 5.4% of
the total U.S. population.
The relative youth and affluence of the Asian-American community is attractive
to marketers.  With a median age of 32, the Asian-American population is five years
younger than the overall U.S. median age.
The Asian population includes many groups, who differ in language, culture, and
length of residence in the United States.  Some of the Asian groups, such as the
Chinese and Japanese, have been in the U.S. for several generations.  Other groups,
such as the Hmong, Vietnamese, Laotians, and Cambodians, are comparatively recent
immigrants.  The following were the largest Asian groups counted in the 2010 U.S.

Compared to the overall consumer market, Asian-American spending is much
more focused geographically.  The five and the 10 states with the largest Asian
consumer markets account for 59% and 75% of Asian buying power, respectively.  By
contrast, the five and the 10 largest total consumer markets account for 39% and 56%
of U.S. buying power, respectively. 
The 10 states with the largest shares of total Asian buying power are as follows:

According to the Selig Center, Asian-American households spend nearly 22%
more than the average U.S. household on homes, furniture, clothing, footwear, vehicle
purchases, public transportation, education, cash contributions, and pensions and
Social Security.  They also spend more on food (groceries and dining out) and
insurance.  Asian households spend less than average on utilities, healthcare, tobacco
products, entertainment, floor coverings, major appliances, personal care products and
services, housekeeping supplies, and alcoholic beverages. 
62.5  Educational Attainment
Forty-nine percent (49%) of Asian-Americans have a bachelor’s degree,
compared with 28% of the general population.  Whereas Asian-Americans make up
5.6% of the population of the United States, they make up more than 30% of the recent
American maths and physics Olympiad teams and Presidential Scholars, and 25% to
30% of National Merit Scholarships.  Among those offered admission to New York’s
most selective public high schools, Stuyvesant High School and Bronx High School of
Science, 75% and 60%, respectively, are Asian.  (The Asian population of New York
City is 13%.)  
Current immigration is increasing the educational disparity between Asians and
other groups because recent immigrants are even more highly qualified than earlier
cohorts: 61% of recent immigrants from Asia have a bachelor’s degree, compared with
30% of recent non-Asian migrants.

62.7  Recent Population Growth
In its study State of the Asian American Consumer, Nielsen reported on the
dramatic growth among Asian Americans compared to other ethnic populations in the
U.S.  Based on 2012 figures by Nielsen, the Asian-American population tops 18.2
million and has increased over 51.0% since 2000, making this the highest growth
rate of any multicultural segment in the U.S.  For comparison, the Hispanic growth rate
was 50.6% for the same period, 2000-2012.
According to Pew Research Center, Indian Americans have been the fastest-
growing immigrant population among Asian Americans, with 87.2% of Indian Americans
in 2010 being foreign-born.  Also ranking high among this group is level of education,
according to the center, with more than 70% of Indian Americans ages 25 and older
having a college degree.  And the median annual income is higher for Indian Americans
compared with all Asian Americans, $88,000 vs. $66,000, respectively.  For
comparison, this figure is $49,800 for all U.S. households.

HISPANIC- & LATINO-AMERICAN CONSUMERS
63.1  Overview
Hispanic Americans and Latino Americans are residents of the United States
with origins in the countries of Latin America or the Iberian peninsula.  
The terms Hispanic American and Latino American are typically used
interchangeably.  Technically, however, Hispanic is a narrower term which mostly refers
to persons of Spanish-speaking origin or ancestry.  Latino is more frequently used to
refer more generally to anyone of Latin American origin or ancestry, including
Brazilians. 
Hispanics are not a race but an ethnic group, which is extremely difficult to
define.  There are no physical qualities that define Hispanics, not even language – 15%
of California’s Hispanics do not speak Spanish.  Among Hispanics that participated in
the 2010 Census, 41% identified themselves as “some other race” on the census race
question or did not respond to the race question at all.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Hispanic is an ethnic origin and not a race. 
Demographers have been trying to explain that
one for decades.  No one struggles with the
distinction between race and ethnicity more
than Hispanics themselves.”

63.2  Profile
According to Census 2010, 308.7 million people resided in the United States in
April 2010, of which 50.5 million (or 16%) claimed Hispanic or Latino origin.  The
Hispanic population increased from 35.3 million in 2000, when this group made up 
13% of the total population.  The Hispanic population increased 43.0% between
Census 2000 and Census 2010, while the non-Hispanic population increased

63.7  Bicultural Hispanics
Findings in FOCUS: Latino, by Horowitz Research (www.horowitzresearch.com),
show that bicultural Latinos, defined as Hispanics who feel strong cultural ties to both
their U.S. and Hispanic identities, represent 53% of U.S. Hispanics.  The study further
found this group to be more educated, higher earners compared to other Hispanics,
and younger overall.
    _________________________________________________________________
“We typically define bicultural Hispanics as first-
or second-generation U.S. citizens who grew up
here. This group has parents who immigrated to
the U.S. and were raised in either a purely
Spanish-speaking or bilingual household and
spent the majority of their life going to U.S. public
schools. They’ve grown up around American
customs and the English language since an early
age, but they’ve maintained their Hispanic
heritage and culture from their home life.”

JEWISH-AMERICAN CONSUMERS
64.1  Overview
Jewish Americans, also called American Jews, include both those of Jewish faith
and people of Jewish ethnicity.
The American-Jewish population is composed predominantly of Ashkenazi Jews
and their U.S.-born descendants, comprising about 90% of the American Jewish
population.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Secularism has a long tradition in Jewish life in
America, and most U.S. Jews seem to recognize
this: 62% say being Jewish is mainly a matter of
ancestry and culture, while just 15% say it is
mainly a matter of religion.  Even among Jews
by religion, more than half (55%) say being
Jewish is mainly a matter of ancestry and
culture, and two-thirds say it is not necessary to
believe in God to be Jewish.”
   A Portrait Of Jewish Americans
   Pew Research
    _________________________________________________________________
64.2  Profile
American Jewish Year Book 2016, 116th Edition, by Sergio DellaPergola (2016,
Springer Publishing) puts the core American Jewish population at 5,425,000.
The community self-identifying as Jewish by birth, irrespective of halakhic
(unbroken maternal line of Jewish descent or formal Jewish conversion) status,
numbers about 7 million, or 2.5% of the U.S. population.

The nature of Jewish identity is changing in America.  According to A Portrait Of
Jewish Americans, a report by the Religion & Public Life Project at Pew Research
Center (www.pewresearch.org), the percentage of U.S. adults who say they are Jewish
when asked about their religion has declined by about half since the late 1950s and
currently is a little less than 2%.  Meanwhile, the number of Americans with direct
Jewish ancestry or upbringing who consider themselves Jewish, yet describe
themselves as atheist, agnostic or having no particular religion, appears to be rising and
is now about 0.5% of the U.S. adult population.  Twenty-two percent (22%) of American
Jews now describe themselves as having no religion.
The changing nature of Jewish identity stands out sharply among generations. 
Among Jewish Americans who are seniors, 93% identify as Jewish on the basis of
religion; only 7% describe themselves as having no religion.  Among Jewish Americans
who are Millennials, 68% identify as Jews by religion, while 32% describe themselves
as having no religion as well as identify as Jewish on the basis of ancestry, ethnicity or
culture.
Within the community, intermarriage rates seem to have risen substantially. 
Among Jewish Americans who have gotten married since 2000, 58% have a non-
Jewish spouse.  Among those who got married in the 1980s, that figure was 42%.
Despite the changes in Jewish identity, 94% of American Jews say they are
proud to be Jewish. 
64.3  Buying Power
According to the Pew Project on Religion and Public Life, 25% of Jewish
Americans report household incomes of over $150,000, compared to 8% of all U.S.
households.  The higher incomes are, in part, because Jewish Americans are generally
better educated.  While 27% of Americans have had college or postgraduate education,
59% of American Jews and 66% of Reform Jews have.  Twenty-five percent (25%) of
American Jews hold a graduate degree, compared with 6% of the general American
population.

MUSLIM-AMERICAN CONSUMERS
65.1  Overview
Because the United States does not track population by religion in its Census,
there is no recognized source of data on the U.S. Muslim population.
According to the Gallup Organization (www.gallup.com), American Muslims are
one of the most racially diverse religious groups in the United States.
Twenty-four percent (24%) of Arab Americans are Muslim.  Census 2010
reported 1.52 million Arab Americans.
Native-born American Muslims are mainly African Americans who make up
about a quarter of the total Muslim population.  Many have converted to Islam during
the last seventy years. 
65.2  Profile
Self-Described Religious Identification of Adult Population, published by the
Census Bureau in 2012, listed 2.6 million Americans of Muslim faith in 2008 (most
recent data available).
A 2011 assessment by Pew Research Center (www.pewresearch.org) placed the
number at 2.8 million.
According to the study Muslim Americans: Middle Class and Mostly Mainstream,
by Pew Research Center, of all Muslim Americans, 65% are foreign-born, with about
34% of Pakistani or South Asian origin and 26% of Arab origin.  Of U.S.-born Muslims,
25% are African American.  Of all U.S.-born Muslims, 21% converted to Islam, 14%

•
A majority of Muslim Americans (56%) say that most Muslims who come to the U.S.
want to adopt American customs and ways of life; just 20% say that Muslims in this
country want to be distinct from the larger American society.
    _________________________________________________________________
“When it comes to many aspects of American
life, Muslim Americans look similar to the rest of
the public.  Comparable percentages say they
watch entertainment television, follow
professional or college sports, recycle
household materials, and play video games.”
                 Pew Research Center
    _________________________________________________________________
•
U.S. Muslims are about as likely as other Americans to report household incomes of
$100,000 or more (14% of Muslims, compared with 16% of all adults).
•
Overall, 46% say they are in excellent or good shape financially; among the general
public, 38% say this.

Muslim Americans are as likely as the public overall to have graduated from college
(26% of Muslims vs. 28% among the general public). 
•
Because as a group Muslim Americans are younger than the general public, twice
as many report being currently enrolled in a college or university class (26% vs.
13%).  Similar numbers of Muslim Americans and members of the general public
report being self-employed or owning a small business (20% for Muslim Americans,
17% for the general public).

NATIVE-AMERICAN CONSUMERS
66.1  Overview
According to the Office of Management and Budget (www.omb.gov), American
Indian or Alaska Native refers to a person as having ethnic origin from any of the
original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and who
maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.
Native Americans are the indigenous peoples within the boundaries of the
present-day United States, including those in Alaska and Hawaii.  They are composed
of numerous distinct tribes and ethnic groups, many of which survive as intact political
communities.  
According to interviews conducted by the Census Bureau, most with an
expressed preference refer to themselves as ‘American Indians’ or simply ‘Indians’; this
term has been adopted by major media and some academic groups, but does not
traditionally include Native Hawaiians or certain Alaska Natives, such as Aleut, Yup’ik,
or Inuit peoples.
66.2  Profile
Census 2010 counted 2.9 million people, or 0.9% of the total U.S. population, of
American-Indian- or Alaska-Native-only ancestry.  An additional 2.3 million people
reported their ethnicity as American Indian or Alaska Native as well as one or more
other races.  Combined, 5.3 million American Indians or Alaska Natives were counted,
representing 1.7% of the population.
The 2014 American Community Survey, published in November 2015 by the
Census Bureau, reported the nation’s population of American Indians and Alaska
Natives, including those of more than one race, at 5.4 million.  They made up about 2%
percent of the total population.  Of this total, about 48% were American Indian and
Alaska Native only, and about 52% were American Indian and Alaska Native in
combination with one or more other races.
The Census Bureau projects the population of American Indians and Alaska
Natives, alone or in combination, in 2060 at 10.2 million.  This will constitute 2.4% of the
total U.S. population.
According to the American Community Survey, there are 1,122,043 American
Indian and Alaska Native family households.  Of these, 54.7% were married-couple
families, including those with children.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  370  •

The median age of the American Indian and Alaska Native population is 31.0
years; 437,339 are age 65 and over.  This compares with a median age of 37.4 for the
U.S. population as a whole.
Seventy-eight percent (78%) of single-race American Indians and Alaska Natives
25 and older have at least a high school diploma, GED certificate, or alternative
credential; 14% have obtained a bachelor’s degree or higher.  For the overall U.S.
population, these figures are 86% and 29%, respectively.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs (www.bia.gov) recognized 566 Indian tribes at year-
end 2015.  The Cherokee is the largest tribe, with 819,000 individuals; it has 284,000
full-blood individuals.  The Navajo, with 286,000 full-blood individuals, is the largest
tribe if only full-blood individuals are counted; the Navajo are the tribe with the highest
proportion of full-blood individuals, 86.3%. 
Twenty-nine percent (29%) of single-race American Indians and Alaska Natives
live in poverty.  For the nation as a whole, the poverty rate is 16%.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 14% of Native
Americans are in poor or fair health, compared with 10% of the overall population. 
Twenty-seven percent (27%) of Native Americans lack health insurance, compared with
17% of the overall population.
66.3  Buying Power
In 2014, the median household income of single-race American Indian and
Alaska Native households was $45,968.  This compares with $66,877 for all U.S.
households.

Seventy percent (70%) of Native Americans lived in urban areas 2012, an
increase from 45% in 1970.  Metropolitan areas with significant Native-American
populations include Minneapolis, Denver, Phoenix, Tucson, Chicago, Oklahoma City,
Houston, New York City, and Rapid City.
There were 326 federally recognized American Indian reservations in 2015. 
There were 630 American Indian and Alaska Native legal and statistical areas for which
the Census Bureau provides statistics.  
Census 2010 reported that 22% of American Indians and Alaska Natives, alone
or in combination, lived in American Indian areas or Alaska Native Village Statistical
Areas.  These American Indian areas include federal American Indian reservations or
off-reservation trust lands, Oklahoma tribal statistical areas, tribal designated statistical

FEMALE CONSUMERS
67.1  Profile
According to the Census Bureau (www.census.gov), the U.S. female population
at year-end 2015 was 163.2 million, which represents 50.8% of the population. 
Distribution by age is as follows:
•
Under 18:
  37.3 million
•
18-to-64:
100.4 million
•
65 and older:
  25.6 million
The median age for females is 39.1.
Census 2010 counted 157.0 million females.
Educational Attainment in the United States, a report from the U.S. Census
Bureau, counted 31.4 million women ages 25 and older with a bachelor’s degree or
more education, higher than the corresponding number for men (30.0 million).  Women
have a larger share of high school diplomas as well as associate’s, bachelor’s, and
master’s degrees.  Fewer women than men have a professional or doctoral degree. 
Educational attainment is an important consumer metric because adults with higher
education typically have higher incomes and spend more.
According to School Enrollment in the United States, by the U.S. Census
Bureau, 56.9% of college students were women during the 2015-2016 academic year.
Thirty-four percent (34%) more women graduated than men in 2015, and by 2023, the
U.S. Department of Education expects female grads to outnumber males by 47%.
67.2  Working Women
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov), 59% of adult
women work or are actively seeking employment.
Among women who don’t work, 27% do not because of family responsibilities;
14% don’t because their family doesn’t want them to work.  Only 6% of men do not
work because of either of these reasons.
Women are found to have higher career aspirations than men.  According to a
study by Pew Research Center (www.pewresearch.org), 66% of women ages 
18-to-34 say that being successful in a high-paying career or profession is very
important in their lives; 59% of men in that age group feel the same way.
Women now hold the majority of professional positions in several occupations,

including journalism, law, marketing, and communications.  These are, in general,
among the highest paying occupations.  In 47 of the 50 largest U.S. metro areas, single
women in their 20s and without children earn more money than their male peers.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Women ages 25-to-34 are the first generation
to start their careers near parity with men,
earning 93% of men’s wages.  Single women
now buy homes at greater rates than single
men, a big step in independent wealth-building.”
     The Economist, 4/16/16
    _________________________________________________________________
Overall career outlooks appear bright for women.  Of the 15.3 million new jobs
projected for the next decade, the vast majority will be in fields that currently attract
more women than men.  Of the 12 job titles projected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics
to grow the most through 2018, women dominate 10 categories.
According to Profile America, from the Census Bureau, women own 29% of all
non-farm businesses; women are also equal partners with men in the ownership of
another 17% of businesses.  Women own 52% of all businesses operating in the
healthcare and social assistance sector.

The median age for men is 36.2 years.
Census 2010 counted 151.8 million males.  The median age for men is 
35.8 years.
Educational Attainment in the United States, a report from the Census Bureau,
counted 30.0 million men ages 25 and older with a bachelor’s degree or more
education, lower than the corresponding number for women (31.4 million).  More men
than women have a professional or doctoral degree but they have a lower share of high
school diplomas as well as associate’s, bachelor’s, and master’s degrees.
According to School Enrollment in the United States, by the U.S. Census
Bureau, 43.1% of college students were male during the 2015-2016 academic year.
68.2  Fathers
Profile America, a report from the Census Bureau, estimated there are 70.1
million fathers in the United States.  Among these, 25.3 million fathers are part of
married-couple families with children younger than 18.  Twenty-two percent (22%) are
raising three or more children younger than 18.
There are 1.8 million single fathers; 15% of single parents are men.  Forty-six
percent (46%) of single fathers are divorced, 30% have never been married, 19% are
separated, and 6% are widowed.  Nine percent (9%) of single fathers are raising three
or more children younger than 18.
According to data by Pew Research Center (www.pewsocialtrends.org), roughly
2.0 million fathers are stay-at-home dads.  At peak, 2.2 million men reported being stay-
at-home dads in 2010 – just after the official end of the recession.
The primary reason for staying at home with the children among men was illness
or disability, cited by 35% of stay-at-home dads.  Caring for the family and the inability
to find work, the reason for 21% and 23% of fathers, respectively, increased sharply in

recent years.  In 1989 these figures were 5% and 15%, respectively.  Those in school,
retired or other comprised 22% of stay-at-home dads.
The annual joint report by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
with differing metrics than Pew for assessing stay-at-home dads, estimates there are
214,000 stay-at-home dads.  This study primarily considers married fathers with
children younger than 15 and who have remained out of the labor force for at least one
year primarily so they can care for the family while their wives work outside the home. 
A Tale Of Two Fathers, by Pew Research Center (www.pewresearch.org),
reported that an increasing number of fathers live apart from their children.  But, those
living with their children are more involved in their lives than in the past.
    _________________________________________________________________
“The role of fathers in the modern American
family is changing in important and countervailing
ways.  Fathers who live with their children have
become more intensely involved in their lives,
spending more time with them and taking part in a
greater variety of activities.  However, the share of
fathers who are residing with their children has
fallen significantly in the past half century.”
           Pew Research Center
    _________________________________________________________________
In 1960, only 11% of children in the U.S. lived apart from their fathers.  That
share has risen to 27%.  The share of minor children living apart from their mothers
increased only modestly, from 4% in 1960 to 8%.
More than one-in-four fathers with children ages 18 or younger now live apart
from their children – with 11% living apart from some of their children and 16% living
apart from all of their children.  One-in-five absent fathers say they visit their children
more than once a week, but an even greater share (27%) say they have not seen their
children at all in the past year.
Almost all fathers who live with their children take an active role in their children’s
day-to-day lives through activities such as sharing meals, helping with homework, and
playing.  
In 1965, married fathers with children younger than age 18 living in their
household spent an average of 2.6 hours per week caring for those children.  Fathers’
time spent caring for their children rose gradually over the past two decades, to 2.7
hours per week in 1975 and 3 hours per week in 1985.  From 1985 to 2000, the amount
of time married fathers spent with their children more than doubled, to 6.5 hours.

68.3  Blurring Gender Roles
While women still do the majority of work in the home, studies have found that
men are more involved domestically than in past decades.
According to Prof. Scott Coltrane, Ph.D., a sociologist and dean of the College of
Arts & Sciences at University of Oregon, compared with the 1960s, the portion of
housework done by men in couple households has doubled, with men now doing 30%
of housework compared with only 15% in the past.  Men have also tripled the amount of
childcare they give.
According to Meet The Modern Dad, a study by The Parenting Group
(www.parenting.com), fathers say the following tasks are mostly their responsibility:
•
Grocery shopping:

•
Cooking:

•
Driving kids to/from school, activities and appointments:
39%
•
Getting kids ready for school or daycare:

A survey by Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) found that 51% of men are primarily
responsible in their household for grocery shopping.  For laundry and cooking the
percentages are 41% and 39%, respectively.

SENIOR CONSUMERS
70.1  Profile
Those born before 1946 have been tagged with various monikers, the most
common being simply ‘Seniors.’  The youngest Seniors turned 71 in 2016.
The Senior generation is also frequently dubbed the ‘Silent Generation,’ a name
coined by Time magazine in 1951, which described the generation as “working fairly
hard and saying almost nothing.”
Census 2010 counted 40.27 million Americans ages 65 or older, representing
13.0% of the population.  The Senior population increased 15.1% from Census 2000,
when 34.99 million people in that age demographic represented 12.4% of the
population.
The U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov) estimated the year-end 2015 
Senior population at 29.19 million.

Aging in America, by Prince Market Research (www.pmresearch.com), reports
that 89% of Seniors feel that the ability to live independently and remain in their home is
very important.  More than half (53%), however, are concerned with their ability to do
so.  Seniors cited three primary concerns that could jeopardize their ability to live
independently: health problems (53%), memory problems (26%), and the inability to
drive/get around (23%).  
The majority of Seniors (55%) view themselves as very independent in that they
receive no assistance from their children – and seem content with that fact; 75% said
their children are involved enough in their life.  Seniors who do require help from others
receive assistance with household maintenance (20%), transportation (13%), and
healthcare (8%).  Only 1% reported receiving any financial support.
According to Pew Research Center’s Social & Demographic Trends Project, 63%
of those ages 65 or older feel they are in excellent or good health.  For those living in
the west, that figure rises to 72%.

70.5  Buying Power
Recent data by the Federal Reserve show elderly Americans to be among the
wealthiest, with people 75 and older showing a median family net worth of almost
$195,000 in constant 2013 dollars, up from $131,000 from 1989.  This group’s
prosperity today comes from prime years of working – plus investing and saving –
during a period when the economy consistently grew an average 3.5% a year – the
period between 1962 and 1991.  More than anything, however, this group benefitted
from ownership of homes and investments that have soared in value.
Based on spending patterns, researchers for the Bureau of Labor Statistics
(www.bls.gov) segment Seniors as follows:
•
Basic Need-Meeters (26.9%): The largest and poorest cluster, this segment had an
average income of $33,147 and spent just $23,679.  Because of their limited
resources, Basic Need-Meeters must devote the largest share of their spending to
essentials – 43%.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  391  •

•
Housing Burdened (25.9%): 78% of households in this cluster are still making
mortgage payments, compared with only 23% to 34% of households in other
clusters.  Consequently, the Housing Burdened devote the largest share of their
budget to mortgage (rent) – 42% of their spending vs only 5% to 17% among other
clusters.
•
Healthcare Burdened (21.1%): The second-poorest cluster, this group is defined by
its outsized out-of-pocket healthcare spending – or 27% of its $29,818 overall
spending.  Other groups devote only 10% to 12% of their spending to healthcare.
•
Transportation Burdened (12.1%): Although this group spent an average $44,245, it
had to devote a hefty 33% of that spending to transportation.  Fully, 60% of this
group live in smaller cities of the South and Midwest.
•
Happy Retirees (6.3%): This is the richest group, with average annual spending of
$54,813.  They devote 31% of their budget to “expendables” like entertainment,
travel and household operations.
•
Balanced Budgeters (5.4%): This group is almost as affluent as Happy Retirees, but
it spends less ($47,920 vs $54,813).  An average amount of their spending is
devoted to various budget items, which is why they are considered “balanced.”

The oldest of the Baby Boomers – born in 1946 and 2.8 million in number –
turned 70 in 2016; the youngest Boomers – born in 1964 – turned 52.  
Census 2010 counted 76.94 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964,

71.2  Generational Characteristics
AARP (www.aarp.org) provides the following insight into Baby Boomer
households:
•
Thirty-seven percent (37%) of Baby Boomers have a child age 18 or younger living
in the household.
•
Over five million Baby Boomer parents have recently had an adult child move back
into the home, partially due to the rise of “adultolescents” who’ve boomeranged back
into the parental household.
•
Four million Baby Boomers have a parent living with them.
•
Eighty-two percent (82%) of Boomers use the Internet, engaging in activities such
as instant messaging, downloading music or movies, financial transactions, and
online gaming.
•
Contrary to popular perception, few Baby Boomers are downsizing.  Only 6% expect
to be living in a smaller home within five years.
•
Just 11% of Baby Boomers plan to stop working altogether when they reach
retirement age.
According to Pew Research Center’s Social & Demographic Trends Project
(www.pewsocialtrends.org), 52% of Baby Boomers say they are considering delaying
retirement because of the financial setbacks of the Great Recession.
The Nielsen Company (www.nielsen.com) provides the following facts about
Baby Boomers:
•
They dominate 1,023 out of 1,083 consumer packaged goods categories.
•
They watch the most video among demographic groups: 9:34 hours per day.
•
They comprise a of all TV viewers, online users, and social media users.
•

A recent study by Ipsos (www.ipsos.com) found Boomers rely heavily on the
Internet to gain access to information.  Among those who use the Internet at home,
14.8 hours weekly is spent; 4.8 hours are spent online away from home.
71.4  Trends
Baby Boomers & Their Homes: On Their Own Terms, a survey by The Demand
Institute (www.thedemandinstitute.org), found that one-third of Boomers plan to move
when they retire.  Of those ages 50-to-69, 37% said they intend to move.  
Before the Great Recession, much had been made about the incomes of Baby
Boomers and the wealth they stood to inherit from their Senior parents.  Not only has
this cohort seen its inheritance dwindle in the wake of the Great Recession, many lost
much of their own personal wealth as their home values plummeted.  The worse off
among them are those who, today, owe more on their home than what it is worth.
This harsh reality has stymied the plans of Boomers who not only had hopes of
retiring, but who also were planning to cash in on their current home and move after
doing so.  For those who own their home, the dream of selling the suburban homestead
– where the kids grew up, and in some cases have returned – and downsizing to a cozy
condo in a lively urban center has also been dashed.
For the first time in 90 years, American cities are growing faster than their
suburbs.  This is because city centers are where almost everyone wants to live, and few
want a home in the ‘burbs.  So, of the 20.1 million Senior households that will attempt to
sell their homes between 2015 and 2030, an estimated 7.4 million won’t be able to find
people to buy them, according to research from University of Utah.
An unexpected trend in housing among Boomers is that of renting versus
ownership.  Between 2002 and 2012, the number of renters ages 55-to-64 increased by
80%.  For partial comparison, the rate of home ownership dropped by 2.5% among
those ages 60-to-64.

GENERATION X CONSUMERS
72.1  Profile
Most analysts classify those born 1965 thru 1979, a span of 15 years, as
Generation X.  With no major event providing a marker for the boundaries of this
generation – as the end of World War II did for the Baby Boom Generation – some
analysts classify only those born 1965 thru 1975 as Gen X.  Whatever definition is
used, analysts agree that consumers now in their 30s and 40s differ in many ways from
Baby Boomers that proceeded them and Millennials that followed.
Census 2010 counted 61.03 million Americans born between 1965 and 1979,
representing 19.8% of the population.
The ethnic makeup of Generation X is as follows (source: U.S. Census Bureau):
•
Caucasian:
72.8%
•
Hispanic:
16.8%
•
African American:
13.2%
•
Asian:
  1.6%
•
Other:

Generation X is significantly smaller in number than either the Baby Boomer or
the Millennial generations – and, it seems, often overshadowed by these generations.

The U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov) estimated the year-end 2015 
Generation X population at 61.82 million.
72.2  Generational Characteristics
What Generation X is, perhaps foremost in importance, is the best-educated
generation in U.S. history.  Almost half of Gen Xers have a 2- or 4-year college degree,
and more than 10% have a graduate degree.  Gen X households typically include two
income-earning spouses; 68% have dual incomes.
Several recent surveys have shown that younger workers, especially those in
Generation X, hold a work/life balance, opportunities for growth, and good work
relationships higher in importance than generations before them.  Gen X employees
view work as secondary to their lives outside the office, which may mean more time with
their children or time to pursue a hobby.
According to Ann A. Fishman, president of Generational-Targeted Marketing
Corp. (www.annfishman.com), Gen Xers have different values from Boomers,
especially related to their careers.  They want to enjoy their jobs as well as have time
for their own lives.  So Gen Xers are often willing to trade off less money for more
freedom.
72.3  Affluent Gen Xers
The 2015 Affluent Survey by Ipsos (www.ipsos.com) reported Generation X
households comprise 37% of households with at $100,000 or more in annual income;
44% of affluent households are Baby Boomer households.

72.4  Spending Behaviors
Generation X has often been characterized as being non-materialistic, shunning
fashion, brand names, and technological advancements.  These values, to some
extent, were the generation’s effort to distinguish itself from the Baby Boomer’s preppy
era of the early 1980s.  However, while they may not yet have the affluence of Baby
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018

Boomers, Gen Xers have plenty of style and a desire to show it off.  This segment
initially affected fashion and style, then music and movies, and now is influencing the
marketing of furniture and housewares.
For all its individuality and the promise that might have been for marketers as
Generation X approached its peak earning years, Gen X reached the height of its
earnings power during the Great Recession.  Now holding mortgages on homes worth
less than when they bought, saddled with tens of thousands of dollars in student loans,
on average, and raising children under age 18 who are dependent upon them, the
timing of the Great Recession could not have been worse for this generation.  This
generation has earned more than their parents, but their net worth is significantly less
as a result of debt.
72.5  Media Activities
According to recent estimates by eMarketer (www.emarketer.com), nearly 95%
of Gen Xers use mobile phones; 60% of that group use smartphones.  Among Gen
Xers, 72.2% use the mobile Internet at least monthly.
Gen X Internet users also are avid consumers of online content.  They typically
use social networking sites on at least a monthly basis (74.5% of Gen X web users),
and 65.6% use Facebook in particular.  Growth in these areas, as in Internet usage as
a whole, is relatively flat due to market saturation.  Twitter, however, reaches only
14.7% of Gen X Internet users, eMarketer estimates, and usage is growing quickly and
expected to reach 19.5% of this audience in 2017.
Digital video is even more popular among Gen X Internet users than social
networking, with 78.7% downloading or streaming video online at least once per month.
Generation X bridges traditional and digital media usage and its members are
virtually always connected, thanks to mobile devices.  Born before the digital revolution,
Gen X is the first generation to come of age with PCs and the Internet.  Its members
are fully comfortable using both traditional and digital media channels.

MILLENNIAL CONSUMERS
73.1  Profile
Most analysts classify those born from 1980 thru 2000, a span of 20 years, as
the Millennial generation (also known as Generation Y or Echo Boomers).  In 2016,
Millennials spanned ages 16 through 36.
Census 2010 counted 93.40 million Americans born between 1980 and 2000,
representing 30.3% of the population.
The U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov) estimated the year-end 2015 
Millennial population at 92.21 million.
Already the largest generation in the U.S., immigration will further boost the
number of Millennials by 2020, according to the Census Bureau.
The ethnic makeup of the Millennials is as follows (source: U.S. Census Bureau):
•
Caucasian:

•
Hispanic:

27-to-36 groups are almost identically multi-
cultural, as 42% of each comprises Hispanics,
African Americans, and Asian Americans.  This
is only the tip of the iceberg – U.S. Census data
shows that African Americans, Asian Americans,
and Hispanics will generate the vast majority of
the U.S. population growth over the next few
decades.”

The buying power of Millennials is estimated at $600 billion.  Pew Research
Center (www.pewresearch.org) estimated Millennial buying power at $2.45 trillion in
2015.  In 2017, their buying power is projected to eclipse that of Baby Boomers.
In addition to the assessment of Millennials in this chapter, an assessment of
college students is presented in Chapter 75.
According to a study by the Urban Land Institute (www.uli.org), Millennial

73.2  Generational Characteristics
Analysts agree that Millennials differ in many ways from the Baby Boomers and
Generation X that proceeded them: They were raised with the Internet and digital
technologies and they multitask well.  Millennials don’t just embrace technology, for
them it’s a way of life.
Advertising Age provides the following characteristics of Millennials:
•
Millennials spend almost 15 hours a day interacting with various media and
communications technologies.
•
More than one-half of Millennials talk on the phone regularly while watching
television.
•
Twenty percent (20%) of adult Millennials (ages 18-to-31) have at least 25 friends in
their social network.
•
Fifty-nine percent (59%) of Millennials spend at least an hour a day talking on their
cellphones.
•
Console gaming is, by far, the leading leisure activity for Millennial males.  Watching
television and talking on cellphones are most popular with Millennial females.
•
Approximately 11 million Millennials are married – two-thirds of those who are
married have children.
•
Forty-five percent (45%) of Millennials refer to themselves as non-white.
•
Eighty-four percent (84%) of Millennials believe that getting a college degree is
important.
•
Fifty-one percent (51%) of Millennials say it’s important to volunteer for community
service, and 48% have done so.
In its study Millennials in Adulthood, Pew Research Social & Demographic
Trends found the following traits most common among the demographic:
•
A full 50% of Millennials describe themselves as political independents, and 29%
say they are not affiliated with any religion.  These figures are the highest levels of
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018

political and religious disaffiliation recorded for any generation since Pew began its
polling on the topics.
•
Millennials have emerged into adulthood with low levels of social trust.  Just 19% of
Millennials surveyed said most people can be trusted.  This compares with 31% of
Gen Xers, 37% of Seniors, and 40% of Boomers.
•
In spite of overwhelming financial burdens like under- and unemployment and
substantial college debt, Millennials show the most optimism about their finances. 
Thirty-two percent (32%) say they have enough money to lead the lives they want
and 52% expect to in the future.  No other demographic group showed such
optimism.  Interestingly, 51% don’t believe Social Security benefits will be available
to them when they retire.
73.3  Impact Of The Great Recession
Many of the young adult Millennials who expected to be in the early stage of a
career saw their plans derailed by the Great Recession.  
Financial recovery was a slow process for many Millennials, but the majority
were back on track by 2015.  
The General Social Survey, published in November 2015 by the Census Bureau,
reported that 54% of Millennials said their financial situation was getting better.  This
was an increase from 39% and 34% who said this in 2012 and 2010, respectively.
The national unemployment rate for adults ages 18-to-34 declined to 7.7% in the
first third of 2015, a significant recovery from the 12.4% who were unemployed in 2010. 
    _________________________________________________________________
“Five years into the economic recovery, things
are looking up for young adults in the U.S. labor
market.  Unemployment is down, full-time work
is up and wages have modestly rebounded.”
   Pew Research Center, 7/29/15
    _________________________________________________________________
73.4  Millennial Households
The term Boomerang Generation has been coined to reflect those young adults
who have returned to their parents’ home, many overburdened with student loan debt
as well as unemployment.  According to Pew Research Center, 24% of Millennials have
moved back home at least once during or shortly after the Great Recession.
About 35% of Millennials head up their own household, according to Pew
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  405  •

Research Center.  This rate is relatively unchanged since 2012 and even lower than the
level observed in the depths of the Great Recession.
The number of young adults heading their own households is no higher in 2015
(25 million) than it was before the recession began in 2007 (25.2 million).  In 2010, 69%
of 18-to-34-year-olds lived independently.  As of May 2015, only 67% of Millennials
were living independently.  Over the same time period, the share of young adults living
in their parents’ homes increased from 24% to 26%.
    _________________________________________________________________
“In spite of these positive economic trends and
the growth in the 18- to 34-year-old population,
there has been no uptick in the number of
young adults establishing their own
households.  This may have important
consequences for the nation’s housing market
recovery, as the growing young adult population
has not fueled demand for housing units and
the furnishings, telecom and cable installations,
and other ancillary purchases that accompany
newly formed households.”
   Pew Research Center, 7/29/15
    _________________________________________________________________
According to the Clark University Poll Of Emerging Adults, more people ages 
18-to-29 live with their parents than with a spouse.
73.5  Affluent Millennials
While many Millennials are struggling with their careers and personal finances,
others are achieving financial success.
In its report The Rising Cost of Not Going to College, Pew found incomes highest
among college-educated Millennials.  A comparison of those ages 25-to-32 with and
without a bachelor’s degree shows median household incomes of $89,079 and
$39,942, respectively.  With each passing generation, the difference in income grows,
the variance is 20% between Millennials today.
International Demographics (www.themediaaudit.com) reported that 7.3 million
households headed by an 18-to-34 year-old in the 81 largest metropolitan areas had an
annual income in excess of $100,000.

Merrill Edge (www.merrilledge.com) reported that young adults (ages 18-to-34) in
households with investable assets of between $50,000 and $250,000 began their
retirement savings at an average age of 22.  For comparison, Baby Boomers began
saving, on average, at age 35.  These Millennials say they plan to save an average of
$2.5 million by retirement, considerably more ambitious than affluents ages 51-to-64,
who anticipate saving $260,000.  Among all adults in affluent households, the average
retirement savings goal is $860,000.
The Merrill Edge survey found that 47% of affluent Millennial households with
children are willing to cut back on family vacations in order to contribute to a college
fund for their kids; 45% would forego purchasing a new car.

Youth buying power is challenging to assess because personal spending by
teens and tweens, by parents on their behalf, and spending for general costs of raising
a family are intertwined.

Increases in the traditional college-age population and rising enrollment rates
have contributed to the increase in college enrollment.  Between 2000 and 2013, the
18- to 24-year-old population rose from approximately 27.3 million to approximately
31.5 million.  The percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds enrolled in college also was higher
in 2013 (39.9%) than in 2000 (35.5%).
NCES projects enrollment to increase to 22.6 million by the 2023-2024 academic
year.
During the 2015-2016 academic year, colleges and universities awarded
952,000 associate's degrees, 1.8 million bachelor's degrees, 802,000 master's degrees,
and 179,000 doctor's degrees.

CONSUMERS WITH DISABILITIES
76.1  Profile
According to Profile America, from the U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov),
36 million people, or 12% of the U.S. population, have disabilities.  By demographic,
those with disabilities are as follows:

•
Females:
12.3%
•
Males:
11.6%
Age
•
5-to-17:
  5.0%
•

19.4%
•
Difficulty concentrating, remembering or making decisions:
13.5%
•
Hearing:
10.2%
•
Vision:
  6.5%
Among those ages 16 and older with a disability, 72% are not in the workforce;
27% of the overall adult population is not in the workforce.
The National Data Program for the Sciences (www.norc.org) at the University of
Chicago puts the number of people with a disability higher, estimating that 29% of adult
Americans suffer from some disability; 8% have three or more conditions that restrict
their ability to function.  The most common limitation among the disabled is not being
able to carry out basic physical activities like walking, lifting, or carrying things, which
affects 16% of adults.  This is followed by not being able to participate fully in regular
daily activities and other physical disabilities (both 10%), difficulty remembering things
(9%), a serious hearing loss (6%), a serious vision problem (5%), and a mental-health
disability (5%).
WE Media (www.wemedia.com) estimates that 23 million parents in the U.S.
have at least one child between the ages of 5 and 16 with special needs.
The Social Security Administration (www.ssa.gov) reported 4.6 million people
under age 65 were receiving Supplemental Security Income because of disabilities as
of May 2016.

76.2  Market Assessment
The special needs community has nearly $200 billion in discretionary spending,
according to the U.S. Department of Labor, two times the spending power of teens and
more than 17 times the spending power of tweens.  Other estimates are even higher. 
Americans with physical disabilities have combined discretionary income of more
than $250 billion annually, and the 20 million families with at least one member with a
disability represent additional annual disposable income of approximately $258 billion,
according to W.C. Duke Associates (www.wcduke.com).  
Fortune estimated that people with disabilities command approximately $1 trillion
in household purchasing power.

“Handicapitalism.  It’s a term that describes
what’s behind a dawning realization in business:
People with disabilities shouldn’t be viewed as
charity cases or regulatory burdens, but rather as
profitable marketing targets.  Now, mainstream
companies, from financial services to cellphone
makers, are going beyond what’s mandated by
law and rapidly tailoring products to attract
them.”
       The Wall Street Journal 
    _________________________________________________________________
According to Open Doors Organization (ODO, www.opendoorsnfp.org) and the
U.S. Travel Association (www.ustravel.org), people with disabilities spend $13.6 billion
on 31.7 million trips annually.  The airline industry sees $3.3 billion in annual spending
by travelers with disabilities; spending in the lodging sector is $4.2 billion.
Seventy-one percent (71%) of adults with disabilities dine out at least once a
week.
76.3  Marketing To People With Disabilities
Many large companies are raising their profile among people with disabilities. 
MetLife, for example, is reaching out to this community with a division dedicated to
assisting families with special needs in planning for their futures.  The company’s
integrated program includes a comprehensive website, strategic alliances with national
non-profit organizations, and TV ads aired during prime-time that feature individuals

with special needs.  The program has won awards from the National Business &
Disability Council (www.nbdc.com).
Still, while some 100 companies have aired commercials featuring people with
disabilities, such ads are relatively rare.
The most recent Paralympic Games offered a marketing opportunity for
companies.  Official Sponsors and Partners included Adidas, Budweiser, Coca-Cola,
Haier, Johnson & Johnson, McDonald’s, Samsung, UPS, Visa, and Volkswagen.
Disability Matters, an annual conference hosted by Springboard Consulting

Among families with children under 18 at home, there are 5.0 million stay-at-
home moms and 154,000 stay-at-home dads. 
Analysts estimate that more than 18 million young adults ages 20-to-34 live with
their parents, representing about one-third of that age group.
Some five million American grandparents live with one of their grandchildren,
according to the Census Bureau.  Dubbed ‘grandfamilies,’ these households represent
nearly 7% of American families.
For a great number of families now, the economy may be a factor in deciding
family size, including whether to have children at all.  The U.S. recorded 4.25 million live
births in 2008 – the first full year of the recession – down about 68,000 from the prior
year and the first annual decline in births since the start of the decade, according to the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS, www.cdc.gov/nchs).  The number of births
declined further in 2009 to 4.13 million and to 3.95 million in 2012.  
For comparison, the following number of U.S. women are projected to remain
child free:

Child-rearing expenses vary considerably by household income level.  For a child
in a two-child, two-spouse family, annual expenses ranged from $9,130 to $10,400, on
average, (depending on age of the child) for households with before-tax income less
than $61,530, from $12,800 to $14,970 for households with before-tax income between
$61,530 and $106,540, and from $21,330 to $25,700 for households with before-tax
income more than $106,540.
On average, households in the lowest income group spend 25% of their before-
tax income on a child; those in the middle-income group spend 16%; and those in the
highest group spend 12%.
Compared with expenditures on each child in a two-child, two-spouse family,
expenditures by two-spouse households with one child average 25% more on the single
child.  Expenditures by households with three or more children average 22% less on
each child.
Child-rearing expense patterns of single-parent households with a before-tax
income less than $61,530 were 7% lower than those of two-spouse households in the
same income group.  Most single-parent households were in this income group
(compared with about one-third of two-spouse families).

youngest child, are as follows:

A survey by The Nielsen Company (www.nielsen.com) found that children
accompany parents on about 13% of food shopping trips; their presence makes adult
shoppers 150% more likely to buy seasonal items, like pumpkins and turkey.
According to Parental Attitudes Toward Family-Friendly Establishments, 75% of
parents with young children deliberately seek out establishments that have child-
accommodating amenities.  Such amenities might include the availability of high chairs,
child-friendly restrooms, or child activity centers.
77.5  Inter-Generational Households
According to The Return of the Multi-Generational Family Household, a report by
the Social & Demographic Trends Project at Pew Research Center
(www.pewsocialtrends.com), U.S. family households are distributed by generational
category as follows:
•
Two generations (parent and minor child/children):
47%
•
One generation:
34%
•
Multi-generational:
16%
•
Other:

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of households with family and
relatives other than children living in the household, and the increase since 2000, is as
follows:
 
             Households         Increase
•
Parents living in adult children’s household:
3.6 million
    62.7%
•
Live-in brothers or sisters:

    24.0%
•
Other relatives in household:
3.3 million
    65.0%
•
Grandchildren in household:
5.8 million
    10.6%
According to Amy Gover, a multi-generational issues expert at AARP
(www.aarp.org), the most common multi-generational household is one with a
grandparent as head of household with adult children that have moved in with 
their children, an arrangement usually spurred by the needs of one or both to 
combine resources and save money.  The second most popular arrangement is
a grandparent moving in with an adult child’s family, usually for caregiving reasons.
Census 2010 counted 3.1 million children in the U.S. living without a parent in
the household; 59% were living with grandparents.
Pew Research Center found that grandparents who are primary caregivers of
grandchildren are relatively young: 67% are under age 60 and 13% are under 45.
There were also 6.2 million households in 2010 with non-relatives, including
unmarried partners and roommates, an 8% increase from 2000.
According to Stephanie Coontz, Ph.D., a family history professor at Evergreen
State College, a host of factors – among them higher housing costs and the struggling

economy – is prompting families to combine expenses.  Also, inter-generational
households are common among the country’s growing number of immigrants.
77.6  Stepfamilies
According to A Portrait Of Stepfamilies, a report by Pew Social & Demographic
Trends Project, 42% of American adults have at least one step-relative in their family. 
Three-in-10 have a step- or half-sibling, 18% have a stepparent, and 13% have at least
one stepchild.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Several sweeping changes in the demography
of American family life in the past half century –
including increases in divorce and in the share
of babies born out of wedlock – have contributed
to the prevalence of step-relatives.”
         Pew Research Center
    _________________________________________________________________
Seventy percent (70%) of adults who have at least one step-relative say they are
very satisfied with their family life.  Those who don’t have any step-relatives register
slightly higher levels of family satisfaction (78% very satisfied).
People with step-relatives are just as likely as others to say that family is the
most important element of their life.  However, they typically feel a stronger sense of
obligation to their biological family members (be it a parent, a child or a sibling) than to
their step-relatives, according to Pew surveys.
77.7  Market Trends: Adult Children At Home
According to an analysis of Census Bureau data by Pew Research Center, a
record 21.6 million Millennial adults (those ages 18-to-34) live in their parents’ home, an
increase from 18.5 million for youth of the same age in 2007.  It should be noted that
between one-third and half of this group are college students, and some students
reside in dormitories during the academic year.  Nonetheless, this is the highest share
in at least four decades for this age group.
Among young adults ages 25-to-34, 10.7 million lived at home in 2014.  This
represents 25.2% of all in this age demographic.  For comparison, 18.7% and 11.0% of
25-to-34 year olds lived at home in 2007 and 1980, respectively.  In 2014 alone, 1.8

A survey by the Health Resources and Services Administration (www.hrsa.gov),
part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that more than one-
fifth of U.S. households with children have at least one child with special needs.  For
many of these families, much of the care the children receive is at-home family care.
78.2  Eldercare
According to Unpaid Eldercare In The United States, published in September
2015 by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 16% of the U.S. population ages 15 and over,
or 40.4 million people, provide unpaid eldercare.  Among these people, 61% are
employed, 47% are employed full-time, and 57% are female.  
The following is a summary of the report:
•
Individuals ages 45-to-64 are the most likely to provide eldercare (23%), followed by
those ages 65 and over (17%).
•
Nearly one-half of eldercare providers have provided care for two years or less,
while 15% have provided care for 10 years or more.
•
Seventy percent (70%) of eldercare providers care for only one person.  Twenty-two
percent (22%) of eldercare providers care for two people, and 7% care for three or
more.
•
Eighty-three percent (83%) of eldercare providers care only for people with whom
they did not live.
•
Twenty-two percent (22%) of all eldercare providers are parents with children under
age 18 living with them.
•
Over half of eldercare providers ages 15-to-34 care for a grandparent, while the
majority of providers ages 35-to-64 care for a parent.  Providers ages 65 and over
are more likely than those in other age groups to care for a friend or neighbor.
•
On a given day, 24% of providers engage in eldercare.  Eldercare providers who are
ages 65 and older are the most likely to provide care on a given day.
•
There are 6.3 million eldercare providers who care solely for someone with whom
they live.  On average over all days – including days they did and did not provide
care – these providers spend 2.8 hours per day providing care.
•
Eldercare providers who care for a spouse or unmarried partner spend an average
of 4.0 hours per day providing care (includes days they do and do not provide care).
•
On days they provide eldercare, they spend an average of 3.2 hours in caregiving
activities.  Providers ages 65 and over spend the most time providing eldercare (4.4
hours), and providers ages 15-to-24 spend the least amount of time (1.1 hours).
•
On weekend days of providing care, eldercare providers spend an average of 3.6
hours doing so.  This compares to an average of 3.0 hours for those who provide
care on weekdays.
•
On days they provide eldercare, women spend more time providing this care than
do men (3.5 hours compared with 2.7 hours).
•
On days they provide care, 39% of eldercare providers engage in caregiving
associated with household activities, spending on average 40 minutes per day in
these activities.  This includes 28% of providers who engage in eldercare associated

with food preparation and cleanup and 12% who provide eldercare associated with
housework.
•
Thirty-two percent (32%) of eldercare providers engage in caregiving associated
with leisure and sports on days they provide care, spending 1.1 hours per day in
these activities.  This includes 20% of eldercare providers who engage in eldercare
associated with socializing and communicating and 13% who provide care while
watching TV.
•
Women are more likely than men to provide eldercare associated with household
activities on days they provide care (41% compared with 35%), whereas women and
men are about equally likely to provide eldercare associated with leisure and sports
(33% and 30%, respectively).
•
There are 8.7 million eldercare providers whose children live with them.  Of these
parents, nearly one-third (32%) have a child under age 6, and the remainder (69%)
are parents whose youngest child is between ages 6-to-17.
•
Fifty percent (50%) of eldercare providers who are parents of children under the age
of 18 provide care for their own parent. 
•
Most (78%) eldercare providers who are parents are employed, and 63% are
employed full time.  Eighty-five percent (85%) of caregiving fathers are employed full
time, compared with 45% of mothers.
•
Sixteen percent (16%) of eldercare providers who are parents have no spouse or
unmarried partner present in the household.
•
Eldercare providers who are parents are less likely to provide daily care than the
overall population of eldercare providers (12% compared with 21%).

78.4  The Cost Of Caregiving
According to Gallup, caregiving costs the U.S. economy about $25.2 billion per
year in lost productivity.  Caregivers report missing an average of 6.6 workdays per year
because of caregiving responsibilities.
Caregiving In The U.S. - Needs, Issues and Insights, by the AARP Caregiving
Advisory Panel (www.aarp.org/home-family/caregiving/caregiving-advisory-panel/), 
reported that 96% of caregivers influence decisions regarding the purchase of
caregiving health products; 79% of caregivers purchase nearly all of those products.
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  432  •

AARP estimates that unpaid caregivers provide the equivalent of $350 billion
worth of eldercare annually, more than total annual Medicare spending.
78.5  Support For Caregivers
There is evidence that caregivers experience considerable health issues as a
result of their focus on caring for others.  In the National Caregiver Survey by AARP
and the National Alliance for Caregiving (www.caregiving.org), 31% of adult caregivers
reported stress, anxiety, or depression.  
A four-year study at University of Pittsburgh found caregiver mortality rates are
63% above those of non-caregivers.  According to Prof. David W. Coon, Ph.D., at
Arizona State University, the depression rate among caregivers is 23%. 
Researchers at New York University School of Medicine reported that even a
short period of counseling can have a long-term beneficial impact on the emotional
well-being of caregivers.
Some employers are now offering eldercare programs aimed at the health and
well-being of workers who also are caregivers.  Raytheon, for example, offers employee
caregiver seminars on self-care and emotional support.  At Nike and Intel, Powerful
Tools for Caregivers, a program developed by Legacy Health Systems
(www.legacyhealth.org), is offered.  IBM, Exxon Mobil, and Texas Instruments have
funded development of an online version of Powerful Tools.  Similarly, companies like
PepsiCo, KPMG, and Northrop Grumman are offering services to caregivers that range
from parent networks to Web seminars to financial planning.  By encouraging workers
who also have eldercare duties to take better care of themselves, employers hope not
only to raise productivity, but also to scale down healthcare costs.
Retailers are also beginning to provide support.  Kmart, for example, offers The
Caregivers Marketplace, a cash-back program for the purchase of brand-name
healthcare products commonly purchased by caregivers.  It is the first program to assist
family caregivers in managing everyday healthcare product expenses.
Some assisted-living facilities are also offering services for eldercare-giving
families through “respite stay” programs, where the senior family member is signed up
for a short-term stay.  This allows caregivers time off for, say, vacation, or even for
caring for their own major personal needs, like surgery, for example.  Costs typically
range from $150 to $200 daily and include meals, snacks, housekeeping, laundry,
personal care assistance, and basic clinical care.
A specialized media sector also has evolved to serve this demographic – from
publications like Today’s Caregiver, with approximately 50,000 subscribers who pay
$18 a year for the periodical, to Exceptional Parents, a publication for parents of special
needs children, to a host of online resources.

79.2  Second-Generation Americans
According to Second-Generation Americans: A Portrait of the Adult Children of
Immigrants, a report by the Pew Research Social & Demographic Trends Project
(www.pewsocialtrends.org), there are 20 million adults born in the U.S. who have at
least one immigrant parent.  The adult second generation is young (median age 38,
compared with 46 for U.S. adults overall) and has no racial or ethnic majority group.
Among the key measures on which the second generation U.S.-born adults are
better off than immigrant adults: Their median adjusted annual household income and
home ownership rates are higher.  They are more likely to hold a college degree.  The
share in poverty is lower.  On all these measures, second generation adults are at least
as well off as the overall adult population
79.3  U.S.-Born Children
The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution grants an automatic right to
citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. 
The Pew Research Hispanic Trends Project (www.pewhispanic.org) estimated
340,000 of the four million babies born each year in the United States are the offspring
of unauthorized immigrants. 
Unauthorized immigrants comprise slightly more than 4% of the adult population
of the U.S., but because they are relatively young and have high birthrates, their
children make up a much larger share of both the newborn population (8%) and the
child population (7% of those younger than age 18) in the U.S.
Of the 5.1 million children (younger than age 18) of unauthorized immigrants,
79% were born in this country and therefore are U.S. citizens.  In total, four million U.S.-
born children of unauthorized immigrant parents reside in the U.S.; there are 1.1 million
foreign-born children of unauthorized immigrant parents.
79.4  Life In The U.S.

by Public Agenda (www.publicagenda.org), asked immigrants their feelings about their

There are an estimated 1.5 million immigrant-owned U.S. businesses, according
to a study for the Small Business Association (www.sba.gov).  In all, immigrants own
12.5% of U.S. businesses and account for 11.6% of all small business income.
79.5  Assimilation
Measuring assimilation is challenging because it is difficult to define.  For some,
it’s the ability to speak English or the willingness to become a U.S. citizen.  With others,
it may be as superficial as appearance or style of dress.  Others, still, maintain aspects
of their native culture in private while displaying traits of American culture in public.
According to the Census Bureau, English proficiency among the 41 million
foreign-born population living in the United States is as follows:
•
Very proficient in English:
49.9%
•
Speak a language other than English
at home but speak English very well:
34.5%
•
Speak English but not well:
19.3%
•
Speak only English at home:
15.4%
•
Do not speak English at all:
  9.6%
More than 80% of immigrants say they have tried to learn English.  Among
Spanish-speaking immigrants residing in the U.S. for more than 15 years, 75% speak
English regularly; 91% of their children and 97% of their grandchildren can speak
English well, according to the Anti-Defamation League (www.adl.org).
A study by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research (MIRP, www.manhattan-
institute.org) assessed how well immigrants fit in with native-born Americans in three
areas: economic, cultural, and civic.  The assessment, which was directed by Prof.
Jacob L. Vigdor, Ph.D., Public Policy Studies and Economics at Duke University, found
that the nation’s immigrants are adopting American ways just as quickly as they were in
1990, despite a doubling in their numbers.  This contrasts with the historical trend that
the level of assimilation typically drops during times of high immigration because there
are more newcomers who are different from native-born Americans.  This happened,
for example, between 1900 and 1920, when the immigrant population grew by 40% and
assimilation occurred more slowly.  The MIRP study found, however, that Mexicans, the
largest immigrant group, are making slower progress at assimilating than others.  While
assimilating well culturally, Mexicans have a low civic assimilation.
79.6  Future Growth
According to Pew Research Center, if current trends continue, the population of
the United States will rise to 438 million in 2050, from 296 million in 2005, with 82% of
the increase from new immigrants and their U.S.-born descendants.  Of the 117 million
people added to the population during this period, 67 million will be first-generation
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018

immigrants, and 50 million will be their U.S.-born children or grandchildren.
The following are other projections: 
•
Nearly one in five Americans (19%) will be an immigrant in 2050, compared with one
in eight (12%) in 2005.  By 2025, the immigrant, or foreign-born, share of the
population will surpass the peak of the last great wave of immigration a century
before. 
•
The major role of immigration in national growth builds on the pattern of recent
decades, during which immigrants and their U.S.-born children and grandchildren
accounted for most of the population increase.
•
The Latino population, already the nation’s largest minority group, will triple in size
and will account for most of the nation’s population growth from 2005 through 2050.
Hispanics will make up 29% of the U.S. population in 2050, compared with 14% in
2005. 
•
Births in the United States will play a growing role in Hispanic and Asian population
growth; as a result, a smaller proportion of both groups will be foreign-born in 2050
than now.

80.1  Profile
Between 6% and 7% of the adult U.S. population self-identifies as lesbian, gay,
bisexual, and transgender (LGBT), suggesting that there is a LGBT adult population of 
15 million to 16 million in the U.S.  Some estimates, however, place the number of
LGBT people at up to 30 million, or roughly 10% of adults.  Unlike estimates of other
populations, the LGBT population generally includes adults over the age of 18 – the
age when a person is more likely to be fully aware and able to define sexual orientation
or gender identity.
A study directed by Prof. Amy Falkner, an associate dean at the S.I. Newhouse
School of Public Communications at Syracuse University, provides the following facts
about LGBT households:
•
Twenty-one percent (21%) of females and nearly 5% of males have a child under
age 18 living at home.
•
Eleven percent (11%) of males and 8% of females have a child or children ages 18
and older.
•
Four percent (4%) of males and 8% of females are grandparents.
•
Seventy-seven percent (77%) of males and 73% of females are employed full-time.
•
Twelve percent (12%) of males and 15% of females work for a government entity.
•
Thirty-seven percent (37%) are employed at a company providing domestic-partner
health benefits.
•
Twelve percent (12%) of male and 9% of female households own a second home.
•
Ninety-seven percent (97%) of gay Americans are out to their families, friends, or at
work; 85% are out to family, 95% to friends, and 74% at the workplace.
•
Fifty-three percent (53%) of females are partnered, as are 42% of males, with the
largest percentage together four to seven years.
•
Thirty-two percent (32%) of males and 66% of females plan on adding children to
their family in the next three years.
•
Fifty-seven percent (57%) of males and 45% of females live in cities.
A study by Gary J. Gates, Ph.D., of the Williams Institute at the University of
California at Los Angeles (www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/), based on the Census
Bureau’s American Community Survey, found that 31% of same-sex households who
identify themselves as spouses are raising children, compared with 43% of hetrosexual
households.

Transgender people – those who identify with a gender other than that which
they were assigned at birth – number about 1.5 million, or 0.5% of the U.S. population.
80.2  Coming Out Survey
According to a survey by The Harris Poll (www.theharrispoll.com) in conjunction
with Witeck Communications (www.witeck.com), a large majority of gay and lesbian
adults are “out” and honest with others about their sexual orientation.  The survey
showed that four out of five (80%) gay and lesbian adults consider themselves “out” as a
gay or lesbian person.  
In terms of their relationships, 95% of gay and lesbian adults consider themselves
open about their sexual orientation to their close friends.  Seventy-nine percent (79%) of
gay and lesbian adults consider themselves open about their sexual orientation with their
acquaintances/casual friends.  When it comes to the workplace, a significant majority
(67%) of gay and lesbian adults reported being open about their sexual orientation with
their co-workers/colleagues.
Among heterosexuals, 87% said that if someone were to come out to them as
gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender, it would have a positive impact or no impact on
how they would view gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender people.  Also, 67% agree
that if someone they knew was gay or lesbian, they’d want that individual to be open and
honest with them about it, rather than feel the need to hide who he or she really is.
A 2015 survey by Pew Research Center (www.pewresearch.org) found that 52%
of adults have close friends or family members that are gay or lesbian.
80.3  Same-Sex Marriage
Anyone who had reported being married to someone of the same gender in the
2000 Census was reclassified as an “unmarried partner.”  The Bureau changed its
survey and Census 2010 reported 131,729 married same-sex couples.  Of the 646,454
reporting same-sex households, 514,735 consider themselves partnered rather than
married.
In June 2015, the Supreme Court expanded same-sex marriage rights across the
U.S.  At the time of the ruling, 35 states had already enacted legislation allowing same-
sex marriage.
Public opinion polls about gay marriage skew toward increased support for
legalization of gay marriage.  A May 2016 poll by Gallup found support for gay marriage
at 68%, a record high, and more than double the support of 27% Gallup first measured
when the question was asked in 1996.
80.4  Buying Power
Witeck Communications estimated adult LGBT buying power at $884 billion in
2015.

Although past studies have portrayed the LGBT community as an affluent sub-
group, more recent findings suggest they are probably no better off than heterosexual
consumers.  Research at the University of Maryland found that, on average, partnered
gay males earn $10,000 less annually than straight married men.  Partnered lesbians,
however, generally earn $7,000 a year more than straight married women.  But one key
difference influencing disposable income is that gays and lesbians, collectively, have
fewer children.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Buying power is not the same as wealth.  There
is no evidence that same-sex households are
more affluent or, on average, earn more than
others, which is little more than a stereotype.  We
recognize economic research that strongly
suggests that gay men appear likely to earn
slightly less than their heterosexual counterparts,
for instance and that LGBT populations of color
particularly face many job and earnings barriers.”

A recent survey conducted by The Nielsen Company (www.nielsen.com) found
that spending power aside, U.S. same-sex partnered households make 16% more
shopping trips than the average U.S. household (173 average shopping trips vs. 149
average shopping trips for total U.S. households).
These additional trips result in CPG spending of $8,651 vs. $6,898, with m/m
households making 182 shopping trips compared to f/f households making 163 trips.

Of all same-sex households, 51% are female couples and 49% are male
couples, which means that of all U.S. households 0.3% are male couples and 0.3% of

Conceived of by Bonnie McGowan in 1999, Birds of a Feather, in Pecos, New
Mexico, which opened in 2004, is the first retirement community to open that was
specifically developed for LGBT older adults.  There are also communities in Portland,
Oregon, and Fort Myers, Florida, and similar projects are underway in Philadelphia,
Chicago, San Francisco, and Minneapolis.
According to Services & Advocacy for GLBT Elders (SAGE, www.sageusa.org),
there are currently between 1.75 million and 4 million gays and lesbians over age 65,
numbers that are expected to double by 2030.  Today, living in an LGBT-retirement
community is an option for this group.  
  
About 49% of Americans older than 65 considered poor or low-income, and this
includes LGBT seniors.  As such, the issue of affordable housing is critical to this
demographic.  
At the other end of the economic spectrum are wealthy gay couples.  Catering to
this market is Fountaingrove Lodge in Santa Rosa, California, with high-end amenities
and luxury residences priced up to $1 million.  There is an upscale restaurant on site.

One major area recognized as an outlet for the discretionary income spent by the
LGBT community is travel.  According to the 20th Annual LGBT Tourism Study,
published in December 2015 by Community Marketing, the annual economic impact of
LGBT travelers is over $100 billion, about 10% of the U.S. travel market.
Approximately 85% of the LGBT community take annual vacations, compared
with a national average of 64%.  More than one-third take three or more trips.  Almost
50% travel abroad, compared with the national average of 9%.
Similar to all travelers, location and price are key factors when LGBT travelers
select a hotel, but an “LGBT friendly” reputation is also an important motivator.
Further, the CMI survey estimates that 79% of LGBTs in the United States hold a
valid passport, which translates into a significant amount of potential international travel,
and compares to about 39% of the U.S. population overall holding a passport,
according to the U.S. State Department.

MARRIED COUPLES
81.1  Profile
Among the total U.S. population age 18 and older, the share of men and women
who are married fell from 57% in 2000 to 51% in 2010, the lowest percentage since the
government began collecting marital status data more than 100 years ago.
The median age of their first marriage is 29.34 for men and 27.0 for women.  In
1970, the ages were 22.5 and 20.6, respectively, according to the Families and Living
Arrangements, published in 2015 by the U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov).

According to Remarriage In The United States, published in March 2015 by the

According to the Census Bureau, the median income for married-couple
households was $68,426 in 2014.  This was 28% above the overall median household

the percentage who had married by age 40 was 91% for older Boomers, 87% for

younger Boomers, and 82% for Generation X.  Among younger Millennial women, even
if marriage rates return to pre-recession levels, only 77% will have married by age 40.  If
marriage rates do not rebound, only 69% will have married by age 40.  For Millennial
men, the projections are 73% with a rebound and 65% without.
    _________________________________________________________________
“The economic shock of the recession put
marriage on hold for many young adults and
marriage rates are returning slowly (if at all) to
pre-recession levels.  With respect to marriage
at least, our projections indicate that many of
these Millennials will not recover in the future
from the opportunities they have missed as
young adults.  Not only will Millennials be the
biggest ‘singles’ generation in history, but
marital status will split the generation into
haves and have-nots.  That’s because marriage
rates are higher for college graduates, who earn
more and tend to marry one another.”
                   Urban Institute
    _________________________________________________________________
If there is an upside to the lower marriage rate among Millennials, it is a lower
divorce rate.  Sheela Kennedy, Ph.D., and Steven Ruggles, Ph.D., researchers at the
Minnesota Population Center, University of Minnesota (www.pop.umn.edu/), found that
while the overall divorce rate in the U.S. continues to climb, divorce has been declining
among adults under age 35.  This is largely because fewer are marrying and those who
do marry are the most compatible.
Among adults ages 35 and older, about half have experienced divorce or
separation by their late fifties.

As divorce rates hit all-time highs, so too are the number of remarriages. 
According to Pew Research Social & Demographic Trends (www.pewsocialtrends.org),
almost 42 million adults in the U.S. have been married more than once, up from 22
million in 1980.  The number of remarried adults has tripled since 1960, when there
were 14 million.  Among adults who are presently married, roughly a quarter (23%)
have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Fully four-in-ten new marriages included at
least one partner who had been married before,
and two-in-ten new marriages were between
people who had both previously stepped down
the aisle.  This snapshot is only the latest
manifestation of a decades-long rise in the
number of Americans who have ever
remarried.”
  
       Pew Research Center
    _________________________________________________________________
Research by Jeffrey Dew, Ph.D., a professor of family studies at Utah State
University, indicates that financial conflict is a top predictor of divorce.  Couples
who report disagreeing over finances once a week are over 30% more likely to
divorce than couples who disagree about finances a few times per month.  Prof. Dew
also found that couples who had no assets were 70% more likely to divorce than
couples with at least $10,000 in assets.

According to Women, Men and the New Economics of Marriage, a report by Pew
Research Center’s Social & Demographic Trends Project, 28% of married women have
more education than their husbands, while 19% of married men are more educated that
their wives; couples are equally educated in 53% of marriages.  This is a reversal of this
statistic in 1970, when 28% of husbands were more educated and 20% of wives had a
higher level of education.
Since men, particularly working class and poor men, have absorbed 75% of job
losses since 2007, researchers foresee that economic conditions will ultimately
undercut marriage in working class communities, furthering a “divorce divide” that has
been growing since the 1980s between couples with college degrees and those with
less education.
Research at the National Marriage Project (http://nationalmarriageproject.org/) at

82.4  The Military Exchange System
The Military Exchange System (MES) serves all of the U.S. Armed Forces with a
combined 4,028 stores.  MES annual retail sales are approximately $14 billion.  
The largest component of the MES is the Army and Air Force Exchange Service

(AAFES), with $8.8 billion in annual sales.  During its 111 years of operation, AAFES
has evolved from a purveyor of discounted basic necessities to a multichannel retailer
with over 3,000 stores and restaurants and movie theaters, as well as catalogs and a
growing Internet site.  A survey found its prices are just 2.5% higher than Walmart’s, but
shoppers get the added benefit of forgoing sales taxes.
Within the U.S., AAFES stores, also called the PX for ‘post exchange,’ serve as
de facto community centers for 11.5 million active or retired military service members
and their families.  Overseas, AAFES stores give troops the chance to connect with
American culture and commerce through their broad selection of DVDs and electronics
in addition to basic drugstore goods.
For grocery shopping, military personnel, including retirees, turn to a network of
281 stores (including about 95 overseas) operated by the Defense Commissary Agency
(DeCA, www.commissaries.com).  With annual sales of about $5 billion, DeCA
generates revenues roughly equivalent to a conventional supermarket chain.  Federal
law does not allow the agency to make a profit, however, and products are sold at only
a 5% markup from cost.

PET OWNERS
83.1  Overview
The American Pet Products Association (APPA, www.americanpetproducts.org)
estimates that 79.7 million U.S. households (65% of all households) own pets.  For
comparison, in 1988, 56% of U.S. households owned a pet.  Some 46% of all
households today own more than one pet.  
Topping the list of most-owned pets in 2016, there are 95 million freshwater fish
in 12.3 million U.S. homes.  Cats, with 85.8 million felines owned by 42.9 million

RETIREES
84.1  Profile
Eighteen percent (18%) of all U.S. adults are retired, a figure that has increased
by 6% in the last five years and will further increase as Baby Boomers exit the
workforce over the next few decades. 
According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI, www.ebri.org),
about 72% of Americans expect to remain engaged in some type of work after they
officially retire.  Almost half (47%) said they left their jobs sooner than they had
planned.
A study by EBRI based on data from the University of Michigan Institute for
Social Research (ISR, http://home.isr.umich.edu/) found that only 14% of people retire
as planned.  Overall, 38% of older workers retire before the age they had planned, and
48% retire after the age they had planned.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Before age 62, actual retirement is higher than
expected retirement.  But by age 65 the opposite
is the case.  Eighty-one percent (81%) of workers
expect to retire before age 65, but only 64%
actually do so.”
    
   EBRI
    _________________________________________________________________
According to Trends In Retirement Satisfaction In The United States, published
in May 2016 by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 48.6% of retirees say their
retirement is “very satisfying.”
84.2  Retiree Consumers
International Demographics (www.themediaaudit.com) provides the following
characteristics of retirees:
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR 2017-2018
•  459  •

•
Eighty-three percent (83%) of retired adults in the U.S. own their own home.
•
Thirty percent (30%) of retired adults have stocks and CDs.
•
Thirteen percent (13%) of new automobile purchasers are retired, compared with
11% five years ago.  Eight percent (8%) of adults who have a car loan are retired,
compared to 6% five years ago.
•
Sixteen percent (16%) of adults who frequently stay in hotels are retired, compared
to 14% five years ago.
•
Adults who are retired are 6% more likely than the average U.S. adult to frequently
dine out at a full-service restaurant; retirees now make up nearly 20% of all adults
who frequently dine out.
•
Fourteen percent (14%) of adults taking an ocean cruise are retired.
•
Compared with the average U.S. adult, those who are retired spend nearly 30%
more time watching broadcast television, 14% more time watching cable television,
and 25% more time reading a daily newspaper.
•
Retired adults spend only 89 minutes per day online, 26% less than the average
U.S. adult.
Ranked by retirees as a percentage of community population, the largest retiree
markets are as follows:
•
Ocala, FL:
36%
•
Fort Myers-Naples, FL:
34%
•
Daytona Beach, FL:

•
West Palm Beach, FL:

The most affluent retirees can be found in larger markets such as Washington,
D.C., where the average retired adult earns $64,000 in household income and
investment returns.  San Jose, Fort Myers-Naples, San Francisco, and Long Island
follow with household incomes of more than $50,000.
84.3  Saving For Retirement
A study by the Center for Retirement Research (CRR) at Boston College
(http://crr.bc.edu), published in the November 2015 issue of The Journal of Retirement,
estimates 65% to 85% of pre-retirement income is a reasonable “replacement rate” for
most retirees, depending on the type of household.  
The CRR estimates that 52% of Americans may not be able to maintain their
standard of living which it defines as having an income that falls no more than 10%
below the replacement rate.
The biggest problems face those with no private pension at all: 68% of these
Americans are expected to fall short.  Those covered by defined-benefit plans – in
which pensions are linked to a worker’s salary – have the least difficulty: only 20% are
deemed at risk.  Of those in defined-contribution plans, 53% likely will not reach the
replacement rate.

84.4  Post-Retirement Spending
Change in Household Spending After Retirement, published in December 2015
by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, reports that in the first year or two of
retirement, 46% of households spend more than during their working years.  
By the sixth year of retirement, 33% are spending more than they had in their
pre-retirement years.  Post-retirement spending as a percentage of pre-retirement
spending in the sixth year of retirement is as follows:
•
Spending less than 80% of pre-retirement income: 
53.1%
•
Spending 80% to 100% of pre-retirement income:

84.6  Primary Influences On Age Of Retirement
Research shows that debt and health are primary influences that determine
when people retire.
An assessment by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found
that 33% of adults ages 62-to-69 without debt were still working, while 46% with debt
were.  The study also reported that the percentage of 62-to-69-year-olds with debt grew
from 48% to 62% between 1998 and 2010.  Among those with debt, the median
amount owed was $32,130.
    _________________________________________________________________
“Older Americans with debt are more likely to
delay retirement, according to a study by the
Center for Retirement Research at Boston
College.  The study finds a growing share of older
Americans in debt and their debt load rising.”

    _________________________________________________________________
A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (www.nber.org) reported
that among men age 62, the percentage who work full-time is 44% for those in good
health, 39% for those in fair health, 18% for those in poor health, and 4% for those in
terrible health.  Conversely, the percentage of men age 62 and older who are fully
retired rises from 41% for those in good health to 46% for those in fair health, 68% for
those in poor health, and 87% for those in terrible health.

84.7  Trends in Retirement and Semi-Retirement
According to an April 2016 survey by Gallup (www.gallup.com), the average are
U.S. workers anticipate they will retire is 66, up from 64 in 2006 and 60 in 1995. 
Retirement, however, does not suggest that people will no longer work – many will
transition into semi-retirement employment or self-employment.
Thirty-one percent (31%) of non-retired U.S. adults foresee they will retire after
age 67, the current minimum age for receiving full Social Security retirement benefits. 
Another 38% expect to retire between the ages of 62 and 67, spanning the existing
Social Security age thresholds for benefits eligibility, while 23% expect to stop working
before they turn 62 – that is, before becoming eligible for any Social Security retirement
benefits.  
Few plan to retire completely nowadays, and by age 65 many Baby Boomers will
have already transitioned into semi-retirement.  Many surveys suggest work will be
routine during Baby Boomers’ older years.  An AARP (www.aarp.org) national poll of
Boomers found that 80% intend to work at least part time during their ‘retirement’ years. 
According to the Social & Demographic Trends Project at Pew Research Center
(www.pewsocialtrends.com), 52% of working adults ages 40-to-64 say they may delay
their retirement; an additional 16% say they expect never to stop working.
Most who choose to continue working after age 60, or even 65, will likely find a
new source of income; relatively few will remain in their current jobs.  In fact, many have
already left their career jobs.  
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov), just 60% of 60 year-
olds are currently employed.  But according to the AARP, 16% of older Baby Boomers
are self-employed, compared with 10% of the overall workforce.
Aside from a desire to stay active, there will be a wide variation in the lifestyles of
retiring Boomers.  According to Nancy Schlossberg, Ph.D., a professor emeritus of
education at the University of Maryland and author of Retire Smart, Retire Happy:
Finding Your True Path in Life (2005, APA Life Tools), most retirees fall into one of a
half-dozen distinct categories.  There are ‘continuers,’ who maintain work ties in their
chosen fields; ‘adventurers,’ who strike out in entirely different career paths; and
‘searchers,’ who try one organization after another until they find their niche.  A lesser
number may become ‘easy gliders,’ who take each day as it comes, or ‘retreaters,’ who
would rather sit on the couch and watch television.

SINGLE CONSUMERS
85.1  Overview
According to the U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov), there are 105 million
unmarried people over age 18 in the U.S., representing about 45% of the adult

Among unmarried adults, 62% had never been married, 24% are divorced, and
14% are widowed.

in with their parents.  Also, an increasing number of young adults are preoccupied with
their careers, and there are increasing numbers of cohabiting couples.
While almost a quarter of single-person households are made up of young
people under the age of 35 who have never been married, many are financially
independent singles.
85.2  Single-Person Households
The Current Population Survey, by the Census Bureau, reported 42.1 million
non-family households, representing 33.8% of all U.S. households, at year-end 2015.
There were 34.9 million single-person households, or 28.0% of all U.S. households.

couples living together is as follows:
•
Opposite-sex couples:
7.5 million
•
Same-sex couples:

•
Total:
8.1 million
Couples who choose cohabitation over marriage cite several advantages to the
arrangement.  Studies show that never-married couples with the intention of living
together permanently are just as likely to stay together as married couples.
“The question,” says Andrew J. Cherlin, Ph.D., a professor of sociology at Johns
Hopkins University, “is not why fewer people are getting married, but why are so many
still getting married?”

    _________________________________________________________________
A trend that is increasing among singles is that of “committed unmarrieds,” so
dubbed by one sociologist.  More than five million such couples cohabit in the U.S.,
nearly eight times the number in 1970, according to Time.  The family dynamic of
committed unmarried with children is also on the rise.  Households such as these
challenge the perceptions of family, and the greater majority of marketers don’t even
identify the market.
85.4  Spending Power
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov), singles spend 
$2.2 trillion annually, which is 35% of all consumer spending.
The average single-household income is approximately $1,400 greater than the
average income of two-person households divided by two; the average one-person
household has over $1,300 in discretionary income.
Despite their spending clout, singles are seldom targeted by advertisers.

only slowly adjusting to the new normal.”

MEGAPOLITAN REGIONS
86.1  Overview
Megapolitan regions, also called megaregions, are clustered networks of
American cities characterized by high density populations, high growth, and, in some
instances, blurring boundaries between cities.  
Eleven (11) megapolitans have been defined by Metropolitan Institute at Virginia
Tech (www.mi.vt.edu) and the America 2050 project at the Regional Plan Association
(RPA, www.rpa.org).  Megapolitan regions were first defined in 2005.
A map of the megapolitan regions, as defined by the America 2050 project, is
presented online at www.america2050.org/pdf/2050_Map_Megaregions2008.pdf. 
86.2  Megapolitan Regions Defined
Eighty-three (83) of the top 100 primary census statistical areas are included in
the 11 megapolitan areas.  Major cities in the regions are as follows:

86.4  Population Projections
Seventy-five percent (75%) of the U.S. population resides in the 11 megapolitan
regions.  The population of the megaregions is projected by the RPA to increase 18%
from the 2010 Census through 2025; the rest of the U.S. is expected to rise 14% during
that period.  
Population projections for 2025 are as follows:
•
Arizona Sun Corridor:
  7,362,613
•
Cascadia:
10,209,826
•
Florida:

Megapolitan America (2011, APA Planners Press), by Arthur C. Nelson,
Professor of City and Metropolitan Planning at the University of Utah, and Robert E.
Lang, Professor of Sociology and the Director of Brookings Mountain West at the
University of Nevada Las Vegas, predicts that by 2040 there will be 10 distinct clusters
composed of 23 megapolitan areas that will work together to dominate the U.S.
economy.

METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS
87.1  Overview
The United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB, www.omb.gov)
defines a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) as one or more adjacent counties or
county equivalents that have at least one urban core area with a population of at least
50,000, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration
with the core as measured by commuting ties.  
There are 380 MSAs.  A description of the regions included in each MSA is
available at www.census.gov/population/www/metroareas/metrodef.html.
Population data is available from the U.S. Census Bureau (www.census.gov) at
www.census.gov/popest/.
87.2  MSA Populations
The U.S. population in 2015 was 321,418,820; 275,252,217,000 (85.6%) lived in
metropolitan statistical areas.

METROPOLITAN ECONOMIC PROFILES
88.1  Overview
Pew Research Center (www.pewresearch.org) defines middle-income adults as
those that live in households with incomes two-thirds to double the national median
size-adjusted household income, about $42,000 to $125,000 annually in 2014 for a
three-person household.  Lower-income households have incomes less than two-thirds
of the median, and upper-income households have incomes that are more than double
the median.  Household incomes are adjusted for the cost of living in metropolitan
areas.
88.2  Income Tiers By Metro
A May 2016 report by Pew Research Center assessed the distribution of adults
in lower-, middle-, and upper income households as follows: 
                                            Lower                   Middle                  Upper

well as the placement of local spot ads.  Various geodemographic segmentation tools,

F.6  Retail Sales Reporting
Many companies develop comprehensive retail analyses based on sales data
provided to them by major retail chains.  Reporting companies provide data as varied
as products that consumers purchase as well as how much they spend.  In addition to
receiving a fee for their data, retailers gain access to information that includes their
competitors’ sales figures.  A few retailers, including Walmart, do not release sales
data.
Companies that provide point-of-sale market research data include the following:
•
Experian (www.experian.com/marketing-services/marketing-services.html)

Such companies also develop retail market data based on statistical-sample
monitoring of households.  This approach (e.g., sampling and projecting) was the norm
in the data gathering industry before scanner data became available.
