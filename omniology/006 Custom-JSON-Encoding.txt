Custom Encodings
As we saw in the previous video, any object can be serialized to JSON
cumbersome à remember to call the JSON serializer for every class
how do we do it for nested dictionaries and lists?
dump
à can provide custom callable
à uses a default instance of JSONEncoder
à we can completely override JSONEncoder

Specifying a Custom Encoding Function
à when provided, Python will call default if it encounters a type it cannot serialize
à argument must be a callable
à callable must have a single argument
à that argument will receive the object Python cannot serialize
à can include logic in our callable to differentiate between different types
à or we can use a single dispatch generic function
[ using the @singledispatch decorator from the functools module]
One of the arguments of the dump / dumps function is default
