About the Author
Andrew Hempstead is a travel writer and photographer who has trav-
eled widely throughout Canada from his home in Banff, Alberta. His
research trip for the third edition of this book took him to every corner
of the Maritimes, and along the way he found himself searching for fos-
sils along the Bay of Fundy, wine-tasting in Nova Scotia, and golfing the
fairways of Prince Edward Island.
In addition to this book, Hempstead has authored guidebooks to
Alberta, British Columbia, the Canadian Rockies, and Vancouver, and has
co-authored guidebooks to Atlantic Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
His writing and photography have also appeared in many national and
international publications.

Introduction
T
he most common term used to describe the Maritimes as a tourist
destination is “underrated.” After spending your vacation traveling
through Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island, I’m sure
you’ll agree. This area of Canada possesses a subtle magnetism that is
impossible to define — you just have to experience it to understand —
and offers spectacular scenery to rival that of many other top destina-
tions. Each of the three provinces has its own distinct character, and yet
they come together to create a single destination like no other place on
earth.
How do you distill the essence of the Maritimes into one book? I faced
that challenge as I sorted through my experiences to bring you only the
best and most unique accommodations, restaurants, and attractions.
And they’re just the tip of the iceberg; you can’t go wrong at any of the
places this book describes, but you’ll return home from your Maritime
adventure with your own favorites.
About This Book
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick & Prince Edward Island For Dummies is a 
reference guide. It’s not designed to be a comprehensive, tell-all guide-
book that weighs you down. Each of the three provinces is discussed
separately in individual parts, laid out in a logical sequence so you can
refer quickly to a particular region, or skip a chapter completely if it’s off
your route (although you may want to reconsider after reading up on it).
History is a big part of the Maritimes and travel, but I only dwell on the
past when necessary.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and this is especially true of prices. I therefore suggest that you
write or call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans. The
authors, editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the expe-
riences of readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us; how-
ever, so we encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your
surroundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets, all
favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets.

Conventions Used in This Book
To help you get the information you need easily and quickly, I take the
liberty of using a few conventions throughout this book.
 I use the accepted term “Maritimes” to collectively refer to the
provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward
Island.
 All prices in this book are given in Canadian dollars.
 Dollar sign ($) symbols preceding each listing are designed to give
you an approximate price for a night’s stay in a hotel or a meal in a
restaurant. In the hotel section, the rates I quote are the rack rates
(the hotel’s official rates) for one night for a double room, although
after you read Chapter 8, I hope you never pay this full amount.
When recommending restaurants, I give the range of main course
prices: appetizers, desserts, drinks, and tips are not included in
this amount unless explicitly stated. If a restaurant doesn’t serve
dinner, the price range refers to the lunch menu. Lobster causes a
small problem (not to eat, that’s for sure!) — in almost every
restaurant it’s sold at “Market Price,” so my price ranges do not
include this Maritime delicacy.
The dollar signs represent the following amounts:
Dollar Signs
Hotel
Restaurant
$
$75 or less
$10 or less
$$
$75–$150
$10–$17.50
$$$
$150–$225
$17.50–$25
$$$$
$225 or more
$25 and up
In this book I often include abbreviations for commonly accepted credit
cards. I only include the major ones, so if your particular card is not
listed here, it may or may not be accepted. Call ahead to make sure. The
credit cards and their corresponding abbreviations are as follows:
AE
American Express
DC
Diners Club
DISC
Discover
MC
MasterCard
V
Visa
Foolish Assumptions
In this book, I make some assumptions about you and what your needs
may be as a traveler. Here’s what I assume about you:
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick & PEI For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
2

 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore the Maritimes and wants expert advice when you finally do
get a chance to enjoy that particular locale.
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
deciding whether to take a trip to the Maritimes and how to plan
for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about the Maritimes or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or
attraction available to you. Instead, you want a book that focuses
on the places that will give you the best or most unique experience
in the Maritimes.
If you fit any of these criteria, then Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince
Edward Island For Dummies gives you the information you’re looking for!
How This Book Is Organized
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island For Dummies is
divided into six parts. The chapters within each part cover specific
topics or regions in detail. You can read each chapter or part without
reading the others — after all, there’s no need to read about Prince
Edward Island if you’re heading for Cape Breton Island.
Part I: Introducing Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
and Prince Edward Island
This part introduces you to the three provinces, and highlights — well,
the highlights. I tell you about the best times of year to visit, and
describe the top festivals and events. I also propose four itineraries (a
one-week trip, a two-week trip, a special trip for families, and another for
seafood-lovers). I also offer tips for travelers with special needs, such as
seniors and those with disabilities, as well as budget-planning advice
that all travelers can use.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes
Call it Trip-Planning 101. Here, I lay out the basics and delve into details
to help you get started on the right path. By the end of Part II, you will
know
 The reasons you may or may not use a travel agent to help plan
your trip
 The pros and cons of taking an escorted or package tour
 The ways to get to the Maritimes, and how to get around after you
arrive
Introduction 3

 The different lodging types available to you, and how you can save
money when booking a room
 The useful details, such as the best way to carry your money and
what type of travel insurance will meet your particular needs
Parts III, IV, V: The Provinces
These three parts form the bulk of the book, with each one devoted to a
separate province. I break the parts down further into chapters that
focus on specific regions. Each chapter has all the information you need
to make the most of your visit, including:
 How to get there
 Where to stay
 Where to eat
 What to see and do
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Skip ahead to this part for the best of the Maritimes condensed into a
few pages: ten classic Maritime experiences and my ten favorite seafood
restaurants — with ten people you probably didn’t know were from the
Maritimes thrown in as a bonus.
In the back of this book I include an Appendix — your Quick Concierge —
containing lots of handy information you may need when traveling in the
Maritimes, like phone numbers and addresses of emergency personnel
or area hospitals and pharmacies, lists of local newspapers and maga-
zines, protocol for sending mail or finding taxis, and more. Check out the
Appendix when searching for answers to lots of little questions that may
come up as you travel. You can find Quick Concierge easily because it’s
printed on yellow paper.
Icons Used in This Book
I use five icons throughout this book to call your attention to different
types of information. Here’s what they mean:
Find out useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule your time
when you see the Tip icon.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware.
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick & PEI For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
4

Next to a hotel recommendation, this icon means that the establishment
welcomes children. Next to a restaurant, it indicates that kids are offered
their own menu. In front of an attraction, it emphasizes somewhere your
kids will (hopefully) enjoy.
If you see this icon, you’re about to save some money. It doesn’t neces-
sarily mean that something is cheap — just that it’s a particularly good
value.
This is my favorite icon. When you spot it, you’re in for a special
Maritime welcome.
Where to Go from Here
As you plan your Maritimes vacation, consider my recommendations
while keeping your own interests in mind. Pore over maps and plot out
an itinerary — the idea is to plan ahead, book your transportation and
lodgings, and leave the rest until you get there.
This book is designed to help you juggle the practicalities of advance
planning (like the security of knowing you have a comfortable room to
retire to) with spontaneity (like a spur-of-the-moment restaurant stop or
an exhilarating whale-watching excursion). That way, you don’t have to
worry about the nitpicky details; you can just relax and enjoy the mag-
nificent Maritimes.

Part I
Introducing Nova
Scotia, New
Brunswick, and
Prince Edward
Island

In this part . . . 
O
kay, I know you’re excited about traveling to the
Maritimes! This part breaks it down, nice and easy, by
listing the best places to go and sights to see in each of the
three provinces. It also highlights the pros and cons of travel-
ing to the region at different times of year, provides four itiner-
aries to help you make the most of your time, and suggests
tips for travelers with special needs and for those on a budget.

Chapter 1
Discovering the Best 
of Nova Scotia, 
New Brunswick, and
Prince Edward Island
In This Chapter
 Focusing in on the best lodgings
 Checking out the greatest restaurants
 Exploring the top historic sites
 Driving the most scenic highways
M
aritimes tourist literature is filled with pictures of lighthouses and
seafood, and you’ll see lots of the former and eat lots of the latter.
But in addition, each of the three provinces that this book covers —
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island — offers things
that go beyond the ordinary, which is where this chapter comes in. I
highlight the best and most unique accommodations, restaurants,
attractions, and scenic drives.
This chapter offers a quick rundown of what I consider to be the best
that Canada’s Maritime provinces have to offer. In the destination chap-
ters in Parts III, IV, and V, I go into more detail about these experiences
and destinations; just look for the “Best of the Best” icon you see here.
The Best Places to Stay
Finding comfortable accommodations with the facilities you require in
the price range that fits your budget will go a long way to making your
travels enjoyable. With that in mind, here are the best the Maritimes 
has to offer.

Best splurges
Cities across the Maritimes have a choice of top-end hotels. The only
real surprise is the cost, which is generally a lot lower than elsewhere in
North America.
 In Halifax, the Lord Nelson Hotel & Suites is an excellent choice 
for upscale lodging within walking distance of downtown. See
Chapter 11.
 Glenghorm Beach Resort makes the grade for its Deluxe Suites.
These contemporary, casual units are among my favorite rooms in
all the Maritimes. See Chapter 14.
 For top-notch Saint John accommodations, it’s hard to go past the
old-world charm of Homeport Historic Bed & Breakfast. See
Chapter 16.
 In St. Andrews, a resort town filled with elegant lodgings, none are
more lavish than the Kingsbrae Arms. See Chapter 16.
 On the rural eastern portion of Prince Edward Island, Inn at Bay
Fortune is a once-grand summer estate converted to luxurious
lodging. See Chapter 21.
Best historic getaways
The Maritimes is saturated with historic lodgings — some have been
taking in guests for a century or more, while others are converted 
residences.
 The Lunenburg Arms Hotel has undergone serious renovations,
converting an old inn into a gracious lodging with character-filled
rooms, some with water views. See Chapter 12.
 In Annapolis Royal, the gracious Queen Anne Inn is soaked in
Victorian charm. See Chapter 12.
 Well-priced rooms and a harborside location are the main draws at
the 1810 Consulate Inn, once home to a United States consulate.
See Chapter 13.
 Along the Acadian Coast, the Governor’s Mansion Inn offers up
plenty of history at a reasonable price. See Chapter 15.
 In the heart of Charlottetown, the Inns on Great George oozes the
charm of a bygone era. See Chapter 18.
Best ocean outlooks
Sure, a comfortable bed and clean surroundings are important to an
enjoyable stay. But waking up to water views is especially memorable,
which is what makes the following choices shine.
Part I: Introducing NS, NB, & PEI 
10

 Prospect Bed & Breakfast has a beautiful ocean setting in a small
fishing village, and yet is within an hour’s drive of Halifax. See
Chapter 11.
 Yes, you really can hear the waves whispering at Whispering
Waves Cottages. A lobster dinner delivered to your door is a
bonus. See Chapter 12.
 The name says it all — Water’s Edge Inn combines location with
comfortable rooms to be the best choice in Baddeck. See Chapter 14.
 If you prefer location to luxury, make Seaside Beach Resort your
base while exploring St. Andrews. See Chapter 16.
 Staying in a lighthouse guarantees sweeping ocean views, and so it
is at West Point Lighthouse. One lucky party gets to stay in the
actual light tower while other guests make themselves comfortable
in converted living quarters. See Chapter 20.
Best for active travelers
Keeping in mind that not all travelers are drawn to urban hot spots, I
present you with the best lodgings for those who like to wake up in the
middle of the outdoor action.
 Whales and birds are the main attractions out on Brier Island, and
the place to mingle with fellow wildlife enthusiasts is Brier Island
Lodge. See Chapter 12.
 Seaboard Bed and Breakfast is the ideal hangout for surfers drawn
to the waves of Lawrencetown Beach. No waves? No problem.
Guests have use of canoes and bikes. See Chapter 13.
 Glenghorm Beach Resort has a beachy feel, and activities to
match — think sea kayaking, ocean swimming, and sunbathing. 
See Chapter 14.
 For resort-style activities such as golf, tennis, and swimming, Rodd
Crowbush Golf & Beach Resort will not disappoint. See Chapter 21.
The Best Places to Eat
Unless you plan on staying in accommodations with cooking facilities,
you’ll be eating out a lot on your Maritimes vacation. But restaurant
pricing throughout the three provinces is reasonable and the choices —
in cities and resort areas at least — are varied.
Best seafood
As you’d expect in a region dominated by the ocean, seafood is found on
most menus. I dedicate a full chapter to the subject (see Chapter 23),
but here is a quick glance at the best of the best.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of NS, NB, & PEI 11

Part I: Introducing NS, NB, & PEI 
12
 For the plumpest scallops you can ever imagine, go right to the
source at O’Neil’s Royal Fundy Market and order them cooked to
go. See Chapter 12.
 Truro is in the rural heart of Nova Scotia. So Murphy’s, with its
perfectly battered fish and chips, is a welcome surprise. See
Chapter 13.
 The Chowder House is a simple pine-paneled room. But what it
lacks in ambience it more than makes up for with fresh, inexpen-
sive seafood. See Chapter 14.
 Order crab and mussels, boiled to order on outdoor gas burners, at
the Muddy Rudder. Just don’t expect table service. See Chapter 14.
 At the back of Saint John City Market, Billy’s Seafood Company is
part seafood market, part restaurant, so you can be assured the
blackboard menu features the freshest of fresh seafood. See
Chapter 16.
 Steamed mussels are a common appetizer throughout the
Maritimes, but at Flex Mussels they are the star of the show, with
choices like mussels boiled with roast corn, scallions, kumquats,
and bourbon. See Chapter 18.
 Plan on giving the touristy restaurants in Cavendish a miss and
head to the nearby Blue Mussel Café, which dishes up fresh, inno-
vative seafood. See Chapter 19.
 You should plan on taking in at least one lobster supper while in
the Maritimes. My pick is Fisherman’s Wharf Lobster Supper,
which is halfway between touristy and traditional. See Chapter 19.
Best views
Restaurants with views are notorious for high prices and bad food, but
not in the Maritimes, as you’ll find out at the following eateries.
 Murphy’s on the Water is true to its name. This Halifax restaurant,
at the end of a wharf extending well into the harbor, offers
panoramic views from most tables. See Chapter 11.
 Restaurants are few and far between along the Eastern Shore,
which makes the Lobster Shack even more popular. To make the
most of the location, request an outdoor table, order lobster chow-
der, and watch the Salmon River flow by. See Chapter 13.
 You can see the ocean from many Cape Breton Island dining rooms,
but none have the intimate atmosphere and creative cooking found
at Seascapes Restaurant. See Chapter 14.
 In the tony town of St. Andrews, The Gables is a refreshingly casual
seafood restaurant with a deck that extends to just above the high-
tide mark. See Chapter 16.

Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of NS, NB, & PEI 13
 Yes, the Blue Mussel Café makes the cut when it comes to the Mari-
times’ best seafood restaurants. But every table has views across
delightful Rustico Bay, so I include it here also. See Chapter 19.
Best pub dining
Forget about nachos and chicken wings. In the Maritimes, pub grub usu-
ally includes traditional British cooking or local seafood, and here are
the best of the best.
 The hordes of university students living in Moncton gravitate to
Main Street bars such as the Pump House Brewery for inexpensive
dining (and drinking). See Chapter 15.
 Captain Dan’s attracts a young, hip crowd of New Brunswickers
with its prime waterfront location, well-priced seafood, and live
music. See Chapter 15.
 In Fredericton, veer off the main street to Rye’s Deli & Bar, a fancy
pub known as much for its creative food as its beer. See Chapter 17.
 In downtown Charlottetown the Merchantman Pub serves a mix of
classic pub fare and fresh seafood in a lively atmosphere. See
Chapter 18.
Best Acadian
Forget about the waistline and dine on down-home, hearty Acadian
cooking at one of the following establishments.
 Rappie pie, an Acadian staple, is the specialty at Rapure
Acadienne. But arrive on an empty stomach — the servings are
huge. See Chapter 12.
 At Restaurant Acadian in Chéticamp, traditionally hearty Acadian
cuisine is served by waitstaff in traditional dress. See Chapter 14.
Best inexpensive dining
Everyone loves a bargain, but that doesn’t mean eating poorly. So in this
section I include dining establishments where the prices are as attrac-
tive as the food.
 Inhabiting a prime downtown Halifax locale is Harbourside Market,
where food outlets like Captain John’s serve up well-priced food in
a casual setting. See Chapter 11.
 The décor is bright and cheery, but the prices will catch your eye
at Chez Cora. See Chapter 17.
 At Café Diem, you can check your e-mail while munching away on
healthy, inexpensive lunches. See Chapter 18.
 The Bluefin Restaurant in Souris is notable for its homey atmos-
phere and inexpensive seafood. See Chapter 21.

Part I: Introducing NS, NB, & PEI 
14
The Best Historic Attractions
Sure, the Maritimes has the usual array of museums filled with pre-
dictable collections of pioneer artifacts, but wait! The three provinces
also offer an abundance of remarkable sites that delve into the region’s
long and colorful history.
I don’t delve into too much history in this book. But if I mention a museum
or historic site, you know it’s good (or very important), like the following.
 Halifax Citadel National Historic Site, a 19th-century fort that
holds the title of Canada’s most visited National Historic Site, is
worth visiting for the sweeping harbor views alone. See Chapter 11.
 Halifax played an important role in the aftermath of the Titanic
tragedy. As a result, you can explore plenty of related history, from
the mainstream (Maritime Museum of the Atlantic) to the offbeat
(Fairview Cemetery, the final resting place of third-class seaman J.
Dawson, who was immortalized by a fictional character of the same
name, played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie version of the
tragedy). See Chapter 11.
 South of Halifax, the entire waterfront core of attractive
Lunenburg, home port for the famous schooner Bluenose II, has
been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unaltered state.
See Chapter 12.
 The British and French struggled for control of Annapolis Royal for
almost a century, and many buildings from this era remain along
the main street, including Canada’s oldest wooden building. Just
outside of town is Port-Royal, a replica of Canada’s first permanent
European settlement. See Chapter 12.
 The Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site is a first-rate
museum commemorating one of the world’s best-known inventors.
The basement is devoted to learning games for children. See
Chapter 14.
 The Fortress of Louisbourg, Canada’s largest historical reconstruc-
tion, is also one of its most remote, situated as it is on the north-
eastern tip of Cape Breton Island. See Chapter 14.
 History along the Acadian Coast revolves (not surprisingly) around
the Acadians, a Francophone population who settled the region as
early as the 1730s. To fully immerse yourself in the vibrant culture
of these resilient people, plan on spending time at Village
Historique Acadien. See Chapter 15.
 After fire destroyed much of Saint John in 1877, the city was rebuilt
in brick and stone, and today these elaborate buildings form the
nucleus of a historic downtown precinct. See Chapter 16.

Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of NS, NB, & PEI 15
 Kings Landing Historical Settlement is an outdoor museum that
re-creates life as experienced by the Loyalists, who were driven out
of America for their devotion to England after the American
Revolution. See Chapter 17.
 The country’s Fathers of Confederation gathered in Charlottetown in
1864 to discuss uniting the British North American colonies to estab-
lish the Dominion of Canada. Province House, where the meeting
took place, is still home to the PEI legislature and open to the public.
Charlottetown’s top attraction is Founders’ Hall, which tells the story
of Canada from Confederation to modern times. See Chapter 18.
The Best Scenic Drives
In addition to scheduled stops at official attractions, be sure to allow
extra time for taking in the scenery along the following routes.
 Best in Nova Scotia: For rugged scenery coupled with history and
Francophone culture, the Cabot Trail will not disappoint. Baddeck
is the ideal starting point for this 300km (187-mile) circuit that hits
all the hot spots of Cape Breton Island. From this history-filled vil-
lage, the road cuts across the Margaree Valley to the Gulf of St.
Lawrence and Chéticamp, where Acadians go about the business of
fishing, making arts and crafts, and filling travelers with hearty
cooking. The Cabot Trail then hugs ocean cliffs and cuts through
the rugged interior of Cape Breton Highlands National Park to the
white-sand beaches of Ingonish. See Chapter 14.
 Best in New Brunswick: The drive along the Fundy Coast is geolog-
ically interesting rather than outrageously scenic. It’s divided
roughly in half by the city of Saint John. Head west from here along
Route 1 and pass by tranquil lakes and catch occasional glimpses
of the Bay of Fundy before you reach the resort town of St.
Andrews. Northeast of Saint John, Route 114 passes through Fundy
National Park and the fishing village of Alma before reaching
Hopewell Rocks and heading up the Petitcodiac River to Moncton.
See Chapter 16.
 Best on Prince Edward Island: Fill the gas tank and strike out in
any direction from Charlottetown. Within minutes, you’re sur-
rounded by the bucolic landscape so vividly described by Lucy
Maud Montgomery in Anne of Green Gables. Need a little more
direction? Take Route 1 west from the capital to Summerside, and
then continue along the coastal Région Évangéline via Route 11,
where Acadian culture thrives. As the Northumberland Strait opens
to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, rolling green fields along routes 11 and
14 come to a stark end at red cliffs that drop precipitously into the
ocean. Stop for a slice of Seaweed Pie at Miminegash before return-
ing to the capital via Route 2. See Chapter 20.

Chapter 2
Digging Deeper into 
the Maritimes
In This Chapter
 Stepping back into the past
 Feasting on local cuisine
 Getting a taste for the Maritimes through books and movies
You can spend hours poring over maps and guidebooks while plan-
ning your trip to the Maritimes, but knowing a little background
helps you appreciate the region’s finer points. In this chapter, I do my
best to condense four centuries of history into a few pages, introduce
you to local cuisine, and then round out the chapter with a discussion of
books and movies that give you the chance to get even better
acquainted with the Maritimes.
History 101: The Main Events
Many centuries before the first Europeans arrived, the Maritimes pro-
vided a home for the Mi’Kmaq, coastal dwellers who fished with spears
and hook and line, and also collected shellfish from the shoreline. For
food, hunting was less important than fishing, but a successful hunter
still held a high status among members of the group. Canoes with sails
were used for summer travel, while in winter toboggans (the word
toboggan originates from the Mi’Kmaq word topaghan) and snowshoes
were essential.
Legend has it that a large boulder near Yarmouth (Nova Scotia) was
inscribed by the fearsome Viking Leif Eriksson around 1,000 years ago.
But the region’s first documented European visitor was explorer John
Cabot, who spotted Cape Breton Island in 1497. A century later,
Frenchman Samuel de Champlain sailed into the Bay of Fundy and estab-
lished a fur trading post on a small island in the St. Croix River.

Conditions were harsh, so the party relocated to what is now Nova
Scotia and built Port-Royal, which is now protected as a National
Historic Site, complete with a re-creation of the original fort. The settle-
ment prospered and expanded into what became known as Acadia, or
“Peaceful Land.”
But French settlement didn’t sit well with England, which had colonial
aspirations along North America’s east coast. The first major conflict
between the two occurred in 1613, when the English attacked Port-
Royal. This didn’t stop Acadian settlements from springing up around
the Bay of Fundy, including Grand Pré, which grew into the Acadian capi-
tal. The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, which settled the Queen Anne’s War in
Europe, gave Acadia to England, which they promptly renamed Nova
Scotia (New Scotland), designating Annapolis Royal as the capital.
Having been granted Cape Breton Island and Prince Edward Island in the
treaty, the French built the Fortress of Louisbourg, envisioning a major
trading center and military base. The French also developed Port-la-Joye
(now Charlottetown, the capital of Prince Edward Island), with the aim
of farming the island’s rich soils to provide food for Louisbourg. But hos-
tilities between England and France continued, often mirroring events in
Europe, such as the Seven Years’ War between 1756 and 1763.
In 1755, England began enforcing an oath of allegiance from the
Acadians. Those who were noncompliant — around 8,000 — were
deported. They were loaded onto ships bound for the English colonies
on the eastern seaboard or any place that would accept them. Some
ships docked in England, others in France, and others in France’s
colonies in the Caribbean. In one of the period’s few favorable events,
the Spanish government offered the refugees free land in Louisiana, and
many settled there, where they became known as Cajuns. The poet
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow distilled the deportation tragedy in
Evangeline, a fictional story of two lovers divided by the events.
After the British swept the Acadians from their land, they used free land
grants to lure prosperous planters (gentlemen-farmers from New
England) to the region. Merchants settled in Yarmouth in the 1760s, and
other Anglo settlers went to Prince Edward Island. Even the inglorious
defeat in the American Revolution benefited the British by helping settle-
ment of the Maritimes. Loyalists (Americans loyal to England) by the
thousands poured into Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Around 14,000
Loyalists settled in Saint John, leading to its incorporation as a city (the
first in Canada) in 1785.
One of the more remarkable aspects of Maritimes history was privateer-
ing. Privateers were government-sanctioned pirates who had permission
to capture enemy vessels. They were required by law to take captured
vessels to Halifax’s Privateers Wharf, where the cargo was auctioned off,
a portion of which was handed back to the privateer and his crew.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into the Maritimes 17

In the early 1860s, with the American Civil War raging, England decided
it needed to do something to reform its political influence in the New
World. This was the impetus for the Fathers of the Confederation coming
together at Province House in Charlottetown to discuss a union of
colonies. The gathering formed the groundwork for the 1867 British
North American Act, which established the Dominion of Canada as a con-
federation of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario. Prince
Edward Island joined in 1873. The final piece to the jigsaw puzzle was
Newfoundland, which became Canada’s tenth province by joining the
dominion in 1949.

Taste of the Maritimes: Local Cuisine
To have a true Maritimes experience, eat plenty of seafood and be sure
to experience Acadian cooking.
Swimming in seafood
If you love seafood, you’ll love the Maritimes, where it is a staple for
locals and dominates restaurant menus. Lobsters, crabs, scallops, mus-
sels, clams, halibut, and salmon are all harvested locally. One of the true
joys of local seafood is that you don’t need to spend a fortune to
indulge. For example, fresh boiled lobster is fresh boiled lobster,
whether you pick it up at a market and cook it yourself, or you order it
at the finest restaurant in Halifax. The same goes for other types of
seafood. If you have cooking facilities at your accommodations (many
cottage complexes do), stock up on mussels to steam in white wine,
scallops to sauté with butter and garlic, and crab to boil in salted water.
But maybe you want someone else to do the cooking. Not a problem.
Seafood finds its way onto menus at even the most unassuming restau-
rant. I purposely avoid recommending chain restaurants in this book, but
McDonald’s does warrant a mention for its local McLobster burger, which
it offers throughout the summer. Moving up one step in style is the down-
home atmosphere of a lobster supper in one of the community halls on
Prince Edward Island. Other regional highlights include pickled Solomon
Gundy herring sold from a roadside cart in New Brunswick and planked
Atlantic salmon cooked over an open fire at a resort in Nova Scotia.
Eating Acadian
Not surprisingly, Acadian fare is based on seafood. Two common dishes
include chicken fricot, a hearty stewlike soup chock-full of chicken,
onions, and potatoes; and poutine râpé, boiled or deep-fried pork and
grated raw potatoes, rolled into a ball and dipped in corn or maple
syrup or molasses. Desserts such as sugar pie, apple dumplings, and cin-
namon buns appear on most Acadian menus.
Even if you’re not invited into an Acadian home, you’re welcome to
enjoy the food at Acadian restaurants along La Côte Acadienne (Nova
Scotia), Chéticamp (Nova Scotia), the Acadian Coast (New Brunswick),
and Région Évangéline (Prince Edward Island).
Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
Life on the edge of the world has been the inspiration for many
Maritimes books and movies. Here are a few of the better known.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into the Maritimes 19

The Maritimes in print
A discussion of Maritimes literature can’t begin any other way than with
Anne of Green Gables, by Lucy Maud Montgomery (1877–1942). Born
and raised around Cavendish, on Prince Edward Island, Montgomery
wrote the children’s classic in 1908, using her own childhood as inspira-
tion for the tale of a spunky orphan living on a farm at Avonlea. While
the book has been turned into a TV drama (Road to Avonlea) and a
movie, many places described in the novel still exist, including Green
Gables House, which is open as a tourist attraction.
His Majesty’s Yankees and The Governor’s Lady, both by Thomas
Raddall (1903–1994), do a wonderful job of delving into Nova Scotia’s
past using fictional characters. No Great Mischief (2001), by Alistair
MacLeod, is the story of a Scottish clan that settles on Cape Breton
Island in the late 1700s. Island: The Complete Stories (2001) showcases
MacLeod’s florid writing style as he describes rural life in Nova Scotia.
Nova Scotian Thomas Chandler Haliburton (1796–1865) is credited with
creating the literary character Sam Slick. In The Clockmaker, Haliburton
first coined phrases such as “it’s raining cats and dogs” and “quick as a
wink.”
New Brunswick’s best-known author is Antonine Maillet, a prolific writer
whose book La Sagouine, about an Acadian fisherman’s wife, has been
adapted to a summer stage production in her hometown of Bouctouche. If
you’re interested in Acadia, do pick up a copy of Clive Doucet’s Notes
From Exile (2000), which explores modern-day Acadian culture by com-
bining Doucet’s own experiences with the 1755 deportation. Heartrending
yet gritty, Mercy Among the Children, authored by David Adams
Richards in 2001, is the story of growing up in a rural town along New
Brunswick’s Miramichi River.
The Maritimes on the big screen
Canada has a well-respected film industry that produces dozens of excel-
lent movies that are little-known even within Canada. While most are
obscure, Shattered City: The Halifax Explosion (2003) is worth
searching out for its realistic portrayal of what was, at the time (1917),
the world’s largest man-made explosion. More recently, One More Dead
Fish is a compelling docudrama set in Nova Scotia.
The waterfront precinct of Shelburne was spruced up in 1992 for Mary
Sillman’s War, based on the book War of Duty, which was set in
Connecticut during the American Revolution. Hollywood producers were
so impressed with Shelburne’s historical look that they returned with
Demi Moore and Robert Duvall to film The Scarlet Letter. Modern-day
Part I: Introducing NS, NB, & PEI 
20

scenes from the 1997 movie Titanic were filmed around Halifax. This
city has many links to the famous tragedy, including being the resting
place of many victims, one of which is J. Dawson, the namesake of
Leonardo DiCaprio’s character. Halifax Harbour takes a starring role in 
K-19: The Widowmaker (2002), in which Harrison Ford plays a Russian
naval captain aboard a nuclear submarine.
Halifax has also stood in for a surprisingly diverse number of cities,
including Salt Lake City for the 2005 TV movie Bring Elizabeth Home:
The Elizabeth Smart Story. Scenes from Leaving Las Vegas (1995)
were also filmed in the Nova Scotia capital, as were small parts of The
Shipping News, which was mostly filmed in Newfoundland. The minis-
eries Beach Girls, a teen-angst drama starring Rob Lowe, was filmed in
numerous coastal communities south of Halifax. Outlander, a science
fiction thriller combining Vikings and aliens hasn’t hit the big screen as
of publication of this book — and I won’t be rushing out to see it — but
it gives you a good idea of Eastern shore scenery.
Based on a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Évangéline tells the
story of a young woman from Grand Pré who was separated from the
love of her life during the Acadian deportation. This classic 1929 silent
movie (starring Mexican actress Dolores del Rio) was rereleased on DVD
in 2001.
The setting is supposedly an island off New England, but the Fundy
Coast around Saint John did just fine for filming of the 1986 movie
Children of a Lesser God, which won a host of Academy Awards includ-
ing Best Picture and Best Actress (Marlee Matlin). At the opposite end of
the cinematic scale, the backwoods of New Brunswick have provided a
backdrop for slasher flicks such as the 1997 hit I Know What You Did
Last Summer and Ricky 6 (2000), which was loosely based on the true
story of teenaged satanic serial killer from Long Island. Another movie
released in 2000 was the thriller Frozen with Fear, filmed in and around
Fredericton, with Bo Derek as a wife who witnesses her husband’s
murder. Two years earlier, James Woods and Melanie Griffith were in the
New Brunswick capital filming the crime thriller Another Day in
Paradise.
Lucy Maud Montgomery’s florid descriptions of Prince Edward Island
came to the small screen in the 1980s TV series Road to Avonlea, as
well as numerous movies, including Happy Christmas, Miss King
(1998). Children enjoy watching any of these productions, but don’t tell
them they were filmed in Ontario. One movie that was filmed on the
Island (but you won’t want the kids to watch) is The Ballad of Jack
and Rose, an R-rated drama about a daughter growing up with her
father on a remote commune.

Chapter 3
Deciding Where 
and When to Go
In This Chapter
 Describing the regions
 Making the most of your time
 Sorting out the seasons
 Catching the best festivals and events
D
eciding what you want to see and the best time to visit depends on
many factors. I begin this chapter with a brief overview of each
province, describing spectacular coastal scenery, rural serenity, and the
historical appeal of some of North America’s oldest towns.
After you have an idea of where you want to go on your Maritimes vaca-
tion, you need to decide when to visit. That’s where the second part of
this chapter comes to the rescue. I describe the pros and cons of each
season and use a table to show monthly temperature differences in a
simple format. I end with a round-up of popular festivals and events
(along with a few personal favorites).
Going Everywhere You Want to Be
Even though you can include all three provinces in a weeklong vacation,
rushing through the Maritimes defeats the purpose of enjoying every-
thing the destination has to offer. Instead, plan your travels around your
own interests and needs, using this section to find out the highlights of
each region. I go into more detail in the travel chapters of this book.
Nova Scotia
Almost cut off from the rest of Canada by the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia
(see Part III) is compact and easy to get around, which makes visiting
the various regions a breeze. You’re never more than 60km (37 miles)
from what best defines the province — the ocean. Picturesque fishing
villages, abundant seafood, and the stark beauty of Cape Breton Island
are highlights of a visit to Nova Scotia.

Halifax (see Chapter 11), capital of Nova Scotia and largest city in the
Maritimes, has history and a beautiful location as its major draws. Set
around a spectacular harbor, the city radiates from a compact down-
town core where you find attractions such as Halifax Citadel National
Historic Site, world-class hotels, fine dining, and a lively nightlife.
In southwestern Nova Scotia (see Chapter 12), Peggy’s Cove, Mahone
Bay, and Lunenburg get all the attention for their postcard-perfect
oceanfront settings, but many other South Shore villages you don’t see
in the tourist brochures are equally scenic and a lot quieter. Stroll the
waterfront sections of West Dover, Prospect Point, or Blue Rocks to
experience Nova Scotia without the crowds. The Bay of Fundy is no
scenic gem, but with the world’s highest tides and resident populations
of whales, it’s a huge attraction.
Beyond the TransCanada Highway, which cuts through central Nova
Scotia (see Chapter 13), is a wealth of worthwhile detours. The most
intriguing is to watch the tidal bore (a wall of water that builds up as the
tide comes in against the waters of a river) at Truro. You can also drive
the Glooscap Trail in search of dinosaurs and explore the history of
Pictou by stepping aboard a replica of the sailing ship that bought the
province’s first Scottish settlers.
Cape Breton Island (see Chapter 14) is one of Nova Scotia’s biggest
draws. The island’s most spectacular scenery lies within the protection
of Cape Breton Highlands National Park. The Cabot Trail, one of the
world’s most scenic drives, passes through the park, allowing roadside
views of high sea cliffs, endless ocean, white-sand beaches, and occa-
sionally whales frolicking in the water far below.
New Brunswick
The largest of the three Maritime provinces, New Brunswick (see Part
IV) is also the most varied in terms of landscape, and it offers diverse
experiences to match. An excellent highway system links the three
largest cities — Moncton, Fredericton (the capital), and Saint John —
with other excellent destinations close at hand.
The Acadian Coast of New Brunswick, northeast of the university town
of Moncton (see Chapter 15), has long stretches of sandy beaches and
some of Canada’s warmest ocean water. Parlee Beach, near Shediac, is
especially popular for its warm water, making it the busiest beach in the
Maritimes. If you’re after solitude, head northwest from Moncton to the
beaches in Kouchibouguac National Park.
The world’s highest tides are in the Bay of Fundy, which is bordered to
the west by New Brunswick’s Fundy Coast (see Chapter 16). Fundy
National Park and Hopewell Rocks are the best spots to view the
effects of this natural phenomenon. But a coastal drive must also
include the historic port city of Saint John and the resort town of St.
Andrews, which oozes old money.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where & When to Go 23

The capital of New Brunswick, Fredericton (see Chapter 17) centers on
the Historic Garrison District, which has changed little since the mid-
1800s, when it was filled with English soldiers defending the Maritimes
region from an overland attack. Beyond city limits follow the Saint John
River to historic highlights like Kings Landing Historical Settlement,
and take back roads that lead to dozens of covered bridges.
Prince Edward Island
Usually referred to simply as PEI, Prince Edward Island (see Part V) is
Canada’s smallest province, just one-tenth the size of Nova Scotia. It’s
linked to the mainland by a bridge, but is a world away from the rest of
the country in look and feel. The Island was immortalized by Lucy Maud
Montgomery in her popular Anne of Green Gables novel, and in many
ways retains the charms she wrote of a century ago.
The centrally located capital is Charlottetown (see Chapter 18), which is
chock-full of history, inviting bed-and-breakfasts, and a wide range of
restaurants.
Few places in the world are as closely associated with a fictional charac-
ter as PEI is with Anne of Green Gables. Lucy Maud Montgomery, who
wrote the classic in 1908, used her childhood home of Cavendish (see
Chapter 19) as an inspiration for the young girl who comes to live on a
farm in the village of Avonlea. Tens of thousands of fans visit
Montgomery-related sites annually, including Green Gables House,
Montgomery’s cousin’s farm and the principal setting for the book.
Beyond Charlottetown and Cavendish, don’t expect dramatic scenery
and stunning natural wonders. Instead, you’re greeted by a gently rolling
landscape of cultivated fields surrounded by stark red cliffs that drop
into blue ocean. Many of the Island’s most scenic byways, like coastal
Route 14 through Prince County (see Chapter 20) are unassuming rural
roads. Route 2 leads west from Charlottetown through the pretty farm-
land of Prince County to North Cape, a remote point of land jutting into
the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
You find more bucolic scenery in Kings County (see Chapter 21), espe-
cially south from Route 2. This highway provides access to Prince
Edward Island National Park, protecting a long sliver of the Island’s
northern coastline that extends west to Cavendish.
Scheduling Your Time
Even though being flexible with your time is fun, having at least an idea
of where you want to go before striking out across the Maritimes is
important. I lay out some specific itineraries in Chapter 4, which you can
combine with the tips laid out in this chapter to create a travel strategy
that works best for you.
Part I: Introducing NS, NB, & PEI 
24

 Establishing a base. The vast majority of visitors arriving by air
touch down at Halifax International Airport, and I recommend
that you plan on doing the same. Just a short drive (or cab ride) to
the region’s largest city, the airport is the terminus of flights from
across the continent and beyond. If you only have a few days in the
region, Halifax is a good base for day trips that can include Peggy’s
Cove, Lunenburg, and Annapolis Royal.
 Deciding whether to drive or fly. Distances are such that driving is
the best way to get around the Maritimes. From Halifax, it’s only a
two-hour drive to New Brunswick, four hours to the farthest point
of Prince Edward Island, and five hours to Cape Breton Highlands
National Park.
 If your time is limited. As you see from the itineraries in Chapter 4,
hitting the highlights in one week is possible, but don’t try to fit too
much in. Make all accommodations reservations in advance to save
wasting time each afternoon and schedule at least one multi-night
stop.
 Considering arriving and departing from different airports. The
way airfares are structured these days, travelers aren’t really penal-
ized by purchasing two one-way fares. Rental car drop-off charges
may be worthwhile when factoring in the time saved in not back-
tracking.
 Trying to avoid cities during the week and resort towns on week-
ends. This advice is especially apt in July and August, when locals
escape the city for resort areas such as St. Andrews and Cavendish.
Knowing the Secrets of the Seasons
Sure, it may be bright and sunny in one province while raining in
another. But as a whole, the Maritimes is under the influence of a single
weather pattern whose biggest influencing factor is the Atlantic Ocean.
In spring, the cold ocean water creates a lag in the warming of land. In
fall, the opposite occurs, as the warmth from the ocean delays the onset
of cooler temperatures by a few weeks.
Each of the four seasons is very distinct. Summer is far and away the
most pleasant time of year to visit. But be forewarned, the vast majority
of visitors and local residents take advantage of this season — more visi-
tors arrive in July and August than during the rest of the year combined.
If possible, plan your trip for either late June or early September. Most
attractions are already (or are still) open, the crowds are thinner, and
lodgings offer discount prices. Which time of year do I prefer? I’ll do
what all good politicians do and sit on the fence: I like June for the long
hours of daylight and September for the better weather.

The following table shows the average daytime temperatures and precip-
itation levels in Halifax, which gives you a rough idea for the Maritimes
as a whole.

As a general rule, the farther inland you go, the greater the temperature
differential over the year. For example, Moncton has a hotter average
July temperature than Halifax but is generally colder than Halifax in
winter.

Spring
As the long days of spring begin to warm the land, the snow melts quickly,
giving way to fresh growth and a certain feeling of optimism in the air.
Spring is wonderful because:
 The crowds of summer have yet to arrive.
 Gardens are in full bloom.
 Days are long, with up to 16 hours of daylight.
But this season can also have its drawbacks, such as:
 Foggy days, especially along the Nova Scotia coast and the Bay of
Fundy
 A lot of rain, especially on Cape Breton Island
 Cool temperatures that rule out swimming in the ocean or sun-
bathing
Summer
The climate from mid-June onward makes travel comfortable throughout
the Maritimes. Locals and visitors alike take full advantage of long hours
of daylight and temperatures that often reach 30°C (86°F). Sea breezes
and moderate temperatures along the coast create an agreeable temper-
ature range.
Summer is the busiest travel season for the following reasons:
 July and August are the sunniest and warmest months.
 The Maritimes comes alive with outdoor activities and festivals.
However, keep these points in mind:
 Crowds are at their peak.
 Prices are at their highest, and you must make lodging reservations
well in advance.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where & When to Go 27
What time is it?
All three provinces are on Atlantic standard time (AST), which is one hour ahead of
eastern standard time, two hours ahead of central standard time, three hours ahead
of mountain standard time, and four hours ahead of Pacific standard time.
Clocks move forward one hour for daylight saving time on the second Sunday in
March and turn back on the first Sunday in November.

Fall
The ocean climate creates relatively warm temperatures, prolonging fall
in the Maritimes. The famous colors begin appearing in mid-September
and often linger well into October.
Fall is a favorite time of year because:
 Temperatures remain pleasant well into October.
 Turning leaves put on an incredible display of color.
 Crowds thin out dramatically.
 Lodging rates are discounted.
But remember:
 Many summer-only lodgings begin closing in September, and attrac-
tions shorten their operating hours.
 Daylight hours become shorter.
 You can get caught up in the tail end of a hurricane (like Juan,
which hit Halifax in late Sept 2003, leaving 300,000 people without
power).
 Come October, a distinct chill is in the air.
Winter
When winter hits the Maritimes, it does so with a vengeance, dumping
up to 300 centimeters (118 inches) of snow on some areas in a single
season. The biggest 24-hour snowfall recorded in Halifax was in 1960,
when 96 centimeters (38 inches) fell.
Winter is wonderful for the following reasons:
 Crowds are nonexistent.
 Airlines lower their prices and hotels offer discounted rooms.
 Winter temperatures are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean.
 The snow is great for cross-country skiing.
Keep the following in mind, however:
 Most outdoor attractions are closed.
 Blizzards can make driving dangerous.
 Daylight hours are short.

Hitting the Big Events: A Maritimes Calendar
The Maritimes calendar is brimming over throughout summer, so I focus
my efforts there to give you the cream of the crop. However, the other
seasons offer their own special taste of Maritimes culture: Spring and fall
bring their own festivals and events to the region, while winter is trade
show and exhibition time.
The following major annual events are just the tip of the iceberg. Local
and regional events take place around the region on a weekly basis, so
check individual provincial tourism Web sites (see Appendix) for more
information.
May

In 2008, the book Anne of Green Gables celebrates its 100th anniversary.
In recognition, events are held throughout the year. Visit www.anne2008.
com for a schedule. Most celebrations take place as they do every year
during the annual L.M. Montgomery Festival in Cavendish. Join a writing
workshop on the grounds of Green Gables, enjoy strawberries and ice
cream in the garden of Montgomery’s childhood home, or have your 
children participate in a coloring competition at Avonlea School. Second
weekend in August. For details, go to www.lmmontgomeryfestival.com.
September
Nova Scotia
New Scotland Days commemorate the arrival of Pictou’s first settlers,
who traveled from Scotland aboard the Hector. Activities include wood-
working demonstrations, walking tours, a children’s art center, a reenact-

Following an Itinerary: 
Four Great Trips
In This Chapter
 Hitting the highlights in one week
 Exploring the Maritimes in two weeks
 Seeing the Maritimes with the family
 Taking a seafood-themed sojourn
E
ven though the Maritimes comprises Canada’s three smallest
provinces, you can’t expect to see everything in a single trip. If you
have a specific destination or activity in mind, such as visiting Cape
Breton Island for the Celtic Colours International Festival or golfing on
Prince Edward Island, then you’re well on your way to planning your
trip. For those of you who are still pondering the best way to spend your
time or which route to take, this chapter’s for you. I suggest some itiner-
aries to give you an idea of where you can go and what you can see in
the time you have, as well as a trip geared toward families and another
specifically designed for seafood lovers.
For each itinerary, I take the liberty of assuming you’re flying into Halifax,
the transportation hub of the Maritimes, and then renting a vehicle.
Seeing the Maritimes in One Week
If you have one week, you can visit each of the three provinces — but
only to hit the highlights.
On Day 1, after arriving in Halifax (see Chapter 11), plan on making your
first stop Halifax Citadel National Historic Site. Then wander down to
the harbor and enjoy lunch at Salty’s. Spend the early afternoon brows-
ing the Historic Properties or taking in the Maritime Museum of the
Atlantic. Drive to Lunenburg (see Chapter 12), stopping at Peggy’s
Cove to snap the famous lighthouse picture without the maddening
midday crowds. Spend the night at the Lunenburg Arms Hotel, dining
in-house on the patio at Rissers.

On Day 2, strike out early from Lunenburg and cut across southwestern
Nova Scotia to Digby, walking the docks and then enjoying a scallop
lunch at the Fundy Restaurant. Catch the ferry across the Bay of Fundy
to Saint John (see Chapter 16). Spend the night at the Homeport
Historic Bed and Breakfast and ask your friendly hosts for a dinner rec-
ommendation.
On the morning of Day 3, head north from Saint John to Moncton (see
Chapter 15). If your mid-morning arrival corresponds with the incoming
tide (check at the information center), hang around for the tidal bore.
Continue north to Shediac. Take a dip in Canada’s warmest ocean water
at Parlee Beach. Cross Confederation Bridge to Prince Edward Island
and continue to Charlottetown (see Chapter 18). Dinner at Flex Mussels,
a couple of drinks at Peake’s Quay, and a bed at the Shipwright Inn are
an ideal combination for your first night on the Island.
On Day 4, drive north from Charlottetown to Cavendish (see Chapter
19). Visit the grounds of Green Gables and see other “Anne” attractions;
then spend the afternoon at your leisure — maybe exploring adjacent
Prince Edward Island National Park or golfing at Green Gables Golf
Course. Skip Cavendish’s touristy restaurants and enjoy dinner in
nearby North Rustico at the Blue Mussel Café, and then retire to
Kindred Spirits Country Inn.
Begin Day 5 by driving to Wood Islands for the ferry trip to Caribou.
Stop at Pictou (see Chapter 13) and visit Hector Heritage Quay. Jump
aboard Highway 104 and cross Canso Causeway to Cape Breton Island
(see Chapter 14). Continue along Highway 105 to Baddeck. Spend the
night at the Water’s Edge Inn.
On Day 6, rise early for the spectacular drive through Cape Breton
Highlands National Park to Pleasant Bay, where you have a mid-
morning whale-watching tour booked. Continue along the Cabot Trail
and take lunch at the Chowder House in Neil’s Harbour. Spend the rest
of the afternoon leisurely making your way down the coast to
Glenghorm Beach Resort.
On Day 7, take an early-morning walk along Ingonish Beach, or rise at
your leisure and begin driving the final stretch of the Cabot Trail to
Baddeck. Visit the Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site, and
then enjoy lunch at an outside table at the Lakeside Café. Leave the
island and stay overnight at Truro (see Chapter 13), which is an hour’s
drive from Halifax International Airport.
Exploring the Maritimes in Two Weeks
On Day 1, fly into Halifax and spend the remainder of that day along
with Day 2 enjoying Nova Scotia’s capital. Chapter 11 provides a
detailed sightseeing plan for Halifax.
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Trips 35

On Day 3, head southwest from Halifax to Lunenburg (see Chapter 12),
stopping at Peggy’s Cove and Mahone Bay along the way. That gives
you plenty of time to visit the Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic and to
wander the streets before checking into one of Lunenburg’s historic
inns.
The destination on Day 4 is Shelburne, an easy two-hour drive from
Lunenburg (be sure to hit the road in time to reach Shelburne’s
Charlotte Lane Café for lunch). Spend some time along the waterfront,
watching boat-builders at work. Leave Shelburne and continue south to
Whispering Waves Cottages, where you can order a lobster dinner deliv-
ered to your oceanfront cabin.
On Day 5, continue around the coast of southwestern Nova Scotia to La
Côte Acadienne, where Acadian traditions live on in the cooking at
Rapure Acadienne and in the imposing architecture of Église de Sainte-
Marie. Continue along the Fundy Coast, explore the Digby waterfront,
and step aboard the Lady Vanessa to see what a scallop boat looks like
up close. Pick up fresh seafood from O’Neil’s Royal Fundy Market, and
then check into the Mountain Gap Inn where you can cook up a storm
on one of the supplied barbecues.
Plan on catching the first ferry of the morning on Day 6, crossing the
Bay of Fundy to Saint John (see Chapter 16) with enough time to go
through the New Brunswick Museum before lunching at Market Square.
Continue down the coastline to St. Andrews. Soaking up the village’s
bustling resort atmosphere is easy by walking along the main street
(although if you’re staying at the upscale Kingsbrae Arms, you may not
want to leave the grounds).
On Day 7, drive to Fredericton (see Chapter 17) and join a guided walk-
ing tour of downtown sights such as the Garrison Historic District; then
spend an hour or so on your own exploring the leafy downtown streets
of the provincial capital. From Fredericton, follow the Miramichi River
north to Miramichi and hang a right down the Acadian Coast (see
Chapter 15). With a room booked in Bouctouche at Bellevue sur Mer,
you have time for a beach walk along neighboring Bouctouche Dune.
On Day 8, take a dip in the warm water off Parlee Beach before crossing
the Confederation Bridge to Prince Edward Island. Spend the after-
noon catching up with your childhood memories at Green Gables in
Cavendish (see Chapter 19). Spend the night in a room overlooking
Rustico Bay at Barachois Inn. Nearby, Fisherman’s Wharf Lobster
Supper is a good choice for a casual dinner.
Arrive in Charlottetown (see Chapter 18) early on Day 9, and park at
Founders’ Hall, which is also home to the city’s information center. Walk
up the hill to Province House, in the heart of the historical precinct.
Enjoy a seafood lunch at Water Prince Corner Shop, knowing you’d be
paying a lot more for the same dishes elsewhere. Rodd Brudenell River
Part I: Introducing NS, NB, & PEI 
36

(see Chapter 21) is a world away from the capital but is easily reached in
well under an hour. Make the most of long summer days by fitting in a
round of golf at one of the resort’s two courses.
On Day 10, catch the ferry to Caribou and spend the rest of the morning
at Hector Heritage Quay in Pictou (see Chapter 13). Leave Pictou for
Cape Breton Island (see Chapter 14) and Baddeck. Check into the
Water’s Edge Inn, and then walk over to the Alexander Graham Bell
National Historic Site. Have dinner at the Lynwood Inn Dining Room.
The next morning, Day 11, drive to Ingonish. You have two nights here;
choose Glenghorm Beach Resort for its casual beachside atmosphere,
or the Keltic Lodge for its historical grandeur. Spend the rest of the day
at your leisure, taking a trip with North River Kayak Tours, golfing at
Highland Links, or just doing absolutely nothing at all down on the
beach.
Day 12 is a good one. Rise early to beat the crowds along the Cabot
Trail in Cape Breton Highlands National Park. Drive all the way
through the park — stopping at lookouts, maybe doing a short hike or
two (the Skyline Trail if you’re energetic, Benjie’s Lake Trail if it’s foggy);
take a whale-watching tour at Pleasant Bay; and just generally soak up
the magnificent scenery. The turnaround point is Chéticamp. Back in
Ingonish, dine on creative seafood at Seascapes Restaurant.
On Day 13, drive back to Halifax (443km/275 miles). This is the longest
day’s drive in this itinerary, but it gets you back to your starting point
the night before your flight leaves (and gives you a few extra hours to
shop in Halifax). Book a room at the Quality Inn Halifax Airport for an
early-morning flight, or downtown at the centrally located Waverley Inn
for last-minute shopping.
On Day 14, catch your plane home.
Enjoying the Maritimes with Kids
The attractions and activities incorporated into this itinerary are
designed to appeal to traveling families — a combination of learning
experiences and fun times at a leisurely pace. Like the first itinerary, it
spans seven days.
As with the first two itineraries, Day 1 starts in Halifax (see Chapter 11).
After getting oriented, plan on lunch at the Harbourside Market, where
everyone can choose their favorite food (seafood, pizza, and so on).
Start your vacation off with a splash on a Harbour Hopper Tour. If the
weather is colder, head to the Museum of Natural History, which has a
critter-filled nature center. Drive south to Mahone Bay (see Chapter 12)
and spend the night at the family-friendly Ocean Trail Retreat.
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Trips 37

On Day 2, visit Lunenburg (see Chapter 12), and then backtrack through
Halifax to Highway 102, reaching Hopewell Rocks (see Chapter 16) by mid-
afternoon. This natural attraction has to be explored at low tide; if you
arrive at high tide, wait till the following morning. From Hopewell Rocks,
drive through Pictou (see Chapter 13) to Pictou Lodge Resort, where
the beach and watersports keep everyone busy for the rest of the day.
On Day 3, catch the ferry to Prince Edward Island. It’s a one-hour trip,
which is enough time to find your way to the upper observation deck
and award a prize to the first one in your family to spot the red-and-
white lighthouse beside the ferry dock at Wood Islands (see Chapter
21). Stop at Rossignol Estate Winery for a bottle of Island wine, and
enjoy it on the deck of your cabin at Lakeview Cottages in Cavendish
(see Chapter 19) while the kids burn off energy in the playground.
On Day 4, children (and many grown-ups) familiar with Anne of Green
Gables will want to spend a full morning at Green Gables House. Pick
one of the many surrounding commercial attractions for an afternoon of
fun — Avonlea for Anne fans, Shining Waters Family Fun Park for the
under-12’s, or Sandspit for the older kids. Spend another night in
Cavendish.
Day 5 kicks off with a rural drive to Charlottetown (see Chapter 18). For
a bit of history, a visit to Founders’ Hall is a must, while animal lovers
may enjoy a trip searching out seals with Peake’s Wharf Boat Tours.
Stop at Gateway Village (see Chapter 18) to pick up last-minute sou-
venirs before crossing Confederation Bridge and heading up New
Brunswick’s Acadian Coast (see Chapter 15) to the Rodd Miramichi
River at Miramichi.
Day 6 mixes nature and fun. Take the boardwalk through
Kouchibouguac National Park to reach a remote stretch of beach with
water warm enough for swimming, and then jump back in the car to
head to Moncton. Let the kids go crazy at Magic Mountain Water Park,
and then retire to one of the surrounding family-friendly motels, such as
Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites.
On Day 7, the three-hour drive back to Halifax is easy. Depending on
your flight time, stagger the drive with a stop to watch the Tidal Bore in
Truro (see Chapter 13) or a visit to Shubenacadie Wildlife Park. If your
flight doesn’t depart until early the next day, make reservations at the
Quality Inn Halifax Airport.
Cruising the Coast: In Search of Seafood
Even die-hard seafood lovers like myself may not be able to keep up with
the following one-week itinerary word for word. It’s designed for true
Part I: Introducing NS, NB, & PEI 
38

devotees of the ocean and all it offers up. But even if you’re not a
seafood fanatic, this itinerary gives you some ideas for taking advantage
of the Maritimes’ best-loved export.
Day 1 begins by heading north from Halifax along the Eastern Shore
(see Chapter 13). Make your first stop the Fisherman’s Life Museum in
Jeddore Oyster Pond. In Tangier, drop by J. Willy Krauch & Sons to
stock up on smoked salmon. If the weather is good, take a stroll along
the beach in Taylor Point Provincial Park before continuing on to the
Salmon River House Country Inn, where you dine at the in-house
Lobster Shack.
On Day 2, take Highway 7 to Antigonish, and then cross to Cape Breton
Island (see Chapter 14) via the Canso Causeway. At Baddeck, check into
Bethune’s Boathouse Cottage. Wander along the waterfront and book an
afternoon sailing trip aboard the Elsie, returning to shore in time for
dinner at Baddeck Lobster Suppers.
Day 3 starts out with a short drive along St. Ann’s Bay to Ingonish. Have
some cash on hand for mussels and crab at the Muddy Rudder, a
unique outdoor restaurant where you can watch your lunch being boiled
to order. Then hit the fairways of Highland Links. An evening walk to
Middle Head is a perfect way to walk off dinner from the Atlantic
Restaurant. Spend the night at the Keltic Lodge.
Spend the morning of Day 4 driving the famous Cabot Trail through
Cape Breton Highlands National Park. Wander down to the docks in
Chéticamp to watch crab boats unloading their precious catch. Head to
the Restaurant Acadian for a feast of croquettes de morue (codfish
cakes) served by women in traditional Acadian dress. From Chéticamp,
drive to Pictou (see Chapter 13). Learn about the traditions of fishing at
the Northumberland Fisheries Museum, and spend the night in a water-
front room at the Consulate Inn.
Day 5 starts with a ferry trip to Prince Edward Island. Drive through
Kings County (see Chapter 21) and catch a tour boat from Montague
to visit a large seal colony, or take a kayak tour at Brudenell River
Provincial Park. Plan on enjoying the most formal meal of your trip
(tuck into Malpeque Bay oysters to start, and then get serious with the
seared Atlantic salmon) and a comfortable night’s rest at Dalvay-by-the-
Sea.
Rise early on Day 6 for the drive to Shediac (see Chapter 15) and book a
lobster-fishing trip with Shediac Bay Cruises. After the traps are hauled
up, the lobsters are boiled for an onboard feast. On the way out of town,
have someone snap a shot of you in front of the world’s biggest lobster.
Drive to Saint John and cross the Bay of Fundy, and then drive along
Digby Neck (see Chapter 12) to Brier Island Lodge.
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Trips 39

On Day 7, plan on taking an early whale-watching trip, returning to
Digby in time to enjoy a dockside takeout lunch of scallops from
O’Neil’s Royal Fundy Market. This gives you plenty of time to either get
back to Halifax for an evening flight home, or to drive only as far as
Annapolis Royal and stay at the Garrison House, where the in-house
restaurant does wonders with local seafood.

Part II
Planning Your Trip 
to the Maritimes

In this part . . . 
You know you’re going to the Canadian Maritimes, you’re
doing some reading, and you have an idea of where you
want to travel; now start the actual planning. This section
deals with the different ways to get there, your transportation
options after you arrive, the types of lodging choices and the
rates you can expect to pay, the best ways to deal with your
money while on the road, and assorted odds and ends that
are easy to ignore — but good to remember.

Chapter 5
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Estimating your costs
 Uncovering hidden charges
 Learning about the loonie
 Accounting for taxes
 Coping with a lost or stolen wallet
I
kick off this tiresome subject with some good news: Traveling in the
Maritimes costs less than anywhere else in Canada. If you’re from
Europe, throw in a favorable exchange rate, and you have an inexpen-
sive vacation destination.
Some accommodations and tour companies quote prices in both
Canadian and U.S. dollars. This can sometimes work in your favor, other
times not, depending on the exchange rate of the day.
Planning Your Budget
Budgeting for your Maritimes vacation isn’t hard, and a few hours spent
with pen and paper before leaving home will prevent any surprises.
To come up with the total amount that you plan to spend, begin with
transportation costs, starting from your front door. Include flight costs
(see Chapter 6 for tips on how to fly for less), airport shuttles at both
ends, and car rental. Then add in gas, hotel rates, meals, admissions to
attractions, and the cost of activities you want to participate in (whale-
watching or golf, for example).
Transportation
Costs for transportation, which will likely be the single largest cost asso-
ciated with your trip, are easy to estimate. If you’re arriving by air, begin
with the cost of your plane ticket. Next, add your car rental costs
(Chapter 7 deals with these in detail), including the rental itself, taxes,
and gas expenses. Gas prices can fluctuate quite dramatically, so plan on
paying anything between C$1.10 and C$1.30 per liter.

If you are planning to fly from province to province, transportation costs
will be an even bigger chunk of your budget.
If you’re driving your own vehicle, begin by calculating its fuel consump-
tion. To do this:
1. Fill the gas tank and set the trip odometer to zero.
2. Drive until the tank is nearly empty.
3. Fill the tank again and note the odometer reading.
4. Divide the distance you’ve driven by the number of gallons (or
liters) it took to fill up the second time. This will give you a miles
per gallon (or kilometers per liter) amount.

Lodging
Accommodations costs are the biggest variable in your budget. Where
you stay and, to a lesser degree, when you stay are the determining fac-
tors. Staying mid-week at full-service city hotels is going to take a much
bigger bite out of your budget than choosing rooms in rural bed-and-
breakfasts with shared bathrooms.
In general, rates are at their peak from late June through mid-September.
A month on either side is “shoulder season” (intermediate between 
high and low). The rest of the year is low season, but many bed-and-
breakfasts and inns close down completely through the winter. Refer to
Chapter 3 for seasonal specifics and see Chapter 8 for lodging categories
and costs.
In this book, I use dollar signs ranging from $ to $$$$ to express the
approximate cost for a double room in high season (excluding taxes).
Hostels and some bed-and-breakfasts outside of cities fall into the $
(under C$75) category. (So do many nondescript roadside motels, but I
steer clear of those in this book — you can find them easily enough
using the Internet or accommodations guides.) Moving into the $$ range,
which runs up to C$150, you have a choice of most bed-and-breakfasts
as well as historic inns. In Halifax, the top end of the $$ category will get
you a room within walking distance of the harbor. Moving up to the $$$
(C$150–C$225) and $$$$ (C$225 or more) categories, you will find your-
self in a fine city hotel or at an upscale oceanfront resort. Very few stan-
dard rooms anywhere in the Maritimes cost more than C$250.
Dining
Seafood dominates the restaurant menus across the Maritimes (for the
highlights, refer to Chapter 1 or Chapter 4) and is generally well priced,
even in the top restaurants. If you can do without the niceties associated
with fine dining, seafood is downright inexpensive. When it comes to
dishes like lobster, you’re really not sacrificing culinary quality by eating
at a cheaper restaurant — it doesn’t take a master chef to dunk a lobster
in boiling water for a few minutes and prepare a side of melted butter.
Attractions
The real reason you’re traveling to the Maritimes is to see the sights.
Luckily, they’re so affordable; in fact, they probably make up the small-
est portion of your overall costs. Small town museums often have no
admission fee, or else they request a simple donation to cover costs.
Count on paying around half-price admissions for children and teens up
to the age of 16, while entry for children under the age of 6 is usually
free.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 45

The definition of “child” can drop to as low as 2 years old when that
child fills an actual seat (on a tour boat, for example), so you can’t
always expect a deal.
If you plan on visiting lots of national parks and historic sites, consider
purchasing an annual pass. After all, the Maritimes has five national
parks (out of 39 in all of Canada). An adult day pass costs from C$5.45 to
C$67, while entry to each of the Maritimes’ 30 national historic sites
ranges from C$3.75 to C$16. With these factors in mind, you can decide
which, if any, of the following annual passes best serve your interests:
 The National Parks of Canada Pass, valid for entry to all Canadian
national parks, is C$62 adults, C$54 seniors, C$32 children aged 6 to
16, to a maximum of C$124 per family.
 The National Historic Sites of Canada Pass is C$49 adults, C$42 sen-
iors, C$25 children aged 6 to 16, to a maximum of C$98 per family.
 The Discovery Package combines annual entry to both national
parks and national historic sites for one price — C$77 adults, C$66
seniors, C$39 children aged 6 to 16, to a maximum of C$156 per
family.
You can purchase passes at all national parks and national historic sites.
For more information, click through the Planning Your Visit link on the
Parks Canada Web site, www.pc.gc.ca.
Activities and tours
Although your costs can start adding up if your tastes run to guided
tours and sporting endeavors, the Maritime provinces are still a rela-
tively inexpensive destination. A four-hour whale-watching tour in the
Bay of Fundy, for example, may cost C$50, but compared to C$80 for a
similar trip on the west coast of Canada, it’s an excellent value. Golfing is

Do-it-yourself dining
Wander down to the docks at most coastal towns and you’ll find a fish market of sorts,
selling everything from filleted fish to live lobsters. If you’re staying in a self-contained
unit, cooking fresh lobster, crab, or mussels is as easy as boiling up a big pot of salted
water (okay, mussels are better when steamed with wine, but you get the idea), at a
fraction of the price of dining out. Some accommodations keep a supply of pots espe-
cially for their lobster-boiling guests. Many resorts and smaller bed-and-breakfast inns
have barbecues, allowing you to get a little more creative in your selection of seafood.
Expect to pay around C$12 to C$15 per pound for fresh lobster, crab, or scallops, and
around half that amount for mussels and clams.

another relative bargain: At Highland Links (Cape Breton Island), which
is rated one of the world’s top 100 courses, twilight greens fees during
peak summer season are a steal at C$53.
You can save on some tours, golfing, and big-city options like spa treat-
ments if you book them as part of a hotel package. Hotel Web sites are
the best place to search out these deals.
Shopping
Shopping can make or break your budget. You can spend anywhere from
C$2 on a fridge magnet to well over C$2,000 for an oil painting. Original
artwork aside, you can find plenty to buy that doesn’t break the bank (or
stick on your fridge).
Nightlife
Keeping your costs down when it comes to after-dark entertainment is
easy. In the Maritimes, what you wear or which is the hippest nightspot
don’t matter. The quintessential night out involves simply relaxing with
a pint of beer while listening to traditional Celtic music at a local bar
(that doesn’t charge a cover).
Tips on tipping
Tipping in the Maritimes is no different from anywhere else in North
America. A good standard tip for service providers such as waiters and
cabdrivers is 15 percent to 20 percent. A smaller tip is enough for a beer
at a bar, and C$1 to C$2 per bag is a sufficient tip for a city hotel bellhop.
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
Want to cut vacation costs without cutting corners? Don’t we all. Look
for the Bargain Alert icon throughout this book for hints on keeping
costs down. In addition, here are some general money-saving tips:
 Go off season. Outside of the summer (late June through mid-Sept.)
high season, hotel prices are almost half the price of peak months.
But don’t push it — many smaller places close down completely in
winter.
 Travel mid-week. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to the Maritimes. When you
ask about airfares, see if you can get a cheaper rate by flying on a
different day. For more tips on getting a good fare, see Chapter 6.
 Try a package tour. For many destinations, you can book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing just by
making one call to a travel agent or packager — and often you pay
much less than if you put the trip together yourself. (See Chapter 6
for more on package tours.)
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 47

 Reserve a room with a kitchen. Most motels have a few rooms
with cooking facilities, or at the very least a fridge and microwave.
Buying supplies for breakfast saves you money (and probably 
calories).
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in the Canadian
Automobile Association (CAA, or its American counterpart, AAA),
frequent-flier plans, trade unions, AARP (formerly the American
Association of Retired Persons), or other groups may qualify you
for savings on car rentals, plane tickets, hotel rooms, and even
meals. Ask about everything; you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Ask if your kids can stay in the room with you. A room with two
double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a queen-
size bed, and many hotels won’t charge you the additional person
rate if the additional person is pint-size and related to you. Even if
you have to pay C$10 or C$15 extra for a rollaway bed, you save big
bucks by not taking two rooms.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch rather than dinner. Lunch
usually costs a lot less than dinner at a top restaurant, and the
menu often boasts many of the same specialties.
 Get out of town. In many places, big savings may be just a short
drive or taxi ride away. Hotels just outside the city, across the river,
or less conveniently located can be great bargains. Outlying motels
often have free parking and lower rates than downtown hotels that
offer amenities you may never use. Sure, at a motel you carry your
own bags, but the rooms are often just as comfortable and a whole
lot cheaper. See Chapter 8 for more on accommodations.
 Don’t rent a gas-guzzler. Renting a smaller vehicle is cheaper, and
you save on gas to boot. Unless you’re traveling with kids and need
a lot of space, don’t go beyond the economy size offered by most
rental companies. For more on car rentals, see Chapter 7.
 Don’t use exchange bureaus. Exchange bureaus give unfavorable
rates and then add on a commission. Instead, get your Canadian
cash at an ATM, which always gives you the exchange rate of the
day.
Handling Money
This section describes the Canadian currency, which is similar to that of
the United States, only more colorful and with goofier names. Then, I
look at how you can use the Canadian banking system to get your money
or to pay for purchases using your hometown financial institution.
Finally, I cover what do to if your money or banking cards are lost or
stolen.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
48

Making cents of the loonie
Canadian currency is easy to get used to. Coins come in 1-, 5-, 10-, and
25-cent denominations, as well as $1 and $2. The $1 is a gold-colored
coin that depicts the loon (a common species of bird), known as the
“loonie.” The $2 coin has a silver-colored core with a gold-colored rim
and is best known as the “toonie.” Bills come in the usual denominations
of $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100; they’re all the same size but vary in color.
The $100 bill can sometimes be difficult to cash at smaller businesses or
early in the morning, especially if you’re only buying something small,
like a cup of coffee.
At press time, the Canadian dollar was slightly higher in value than the
U.S. dollar. However, exchange rates fluctuate often (and sometimes dra-
matically), so checking before you go is always a good idea.
The best online tool I know of for checking exchange rates is the
Universal Currency Converter at www.xe.com/ucc.
Doting on debit cards
Using a debit card (also known as an ATM or banking card) is hands-
down the easiest way to manage your money while traveling and is
extremely popular in Canada (in fact, Canadians are the world’s biggest
users of this type of banking). You can use your debit card to withdraw
cash at ATMs or to pay for purchases at point-of-sale terminals installed
at participating merchant locations (over 300,000 in Canada). The
national organization responsible for the network in Canada is Interac
(similar to the Cirrus and Plus networks elsewhere in the world), so you
sometimes hear it referred to as “paying by Interac.” Before relying
solely on debit and ATMs, check with your bank to find out which
Canadian banks honor your card system. The following is a list of the
major Canadian banks and the system(s) they use:
 Bank of Montreal: Cirrus
 Scotiabank: Plus
 TD Canada Trust: Cirrus and Plus
 CIBC: Plus
 Royal Bank: Cirrus and Plus
Using ATMs
These days, far more people use ATMs than traveler’s checks. Most
cities have these handy 24-hour cash machines linked to an international
network that almost always includes your financial institution back at
home. You can use your debit or credit card to withdraw the money you
need every couple of days, which eliminates the insecurity of carrying
around a large stash of cash. Of course, many ATMs are little money
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 49

managers (or dictators, depending on how you look at it), imposing
limits on your spending by allowing you to withdraw only a certain
amount of money per day.
One important reminder before you go ATM crazy, however: Canadian
banks charge a fee of up to C$2.50 whenever a non-account holder uses
their ATMs. Your own bank may also charge a fee for using an ATM that’s
not one of their branch locations. In some cases, you may get charged
twice. Check out your bank’s policy before ruling out traveler’s checks
altogether, since they may be a cheaper — though certainly less conven-
ient — option for you.
Do not use privately owned ATMs. Also known as white-label ATMs,
these banking machines are most often placed in gas stations, corner
stores, restaurants, and bars. Fees can be up to C$4 for a single transac-
tion, in addition to the fee your own bank charges. The businesses that
install these machines split the “convenience fee” you pay with the
machine owners, making a tidy profit for themselves along the way.
Because they are money-makers, some businesses don’t use point-of-sale
terminals, instead forcing you to withdraw cash from one of these pri-
vately owned ATMs hidden away in a corner to pay for your purchase.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards can be invaluable when traveling: They’re a safe way to
carry money and they provide a convenient record of all your travel
expenses when you arrive home. Of course, the disadvantage is that
they’re easy to overuse. Credit cards let you indulge in a lot more
impulse buying than any other form of payment — taking you as far as
your credit limit, which may not bear much relation to your actual finan-
cial resources.
You can also get cash advances from your credit card at any ATM if you
know your Personal Identification Number (PIN). If you’ve forgotten it or
didn’t even know you had a PIN, call the phone number on the back of
your credit card and ask the bank to send the number to you (you
receive the number in about five to seven business days). Some banks
can give you your PIN over the phone if you tell them your mother’s
maiden name or provide some other security clearance.
Use your credit card for a cash advance in emergencies only. Interest
rates for cash advances are often significantly higher than rates for
credit card purchases. More importantly, you start paying interest on
the advance from the moment you receive the cash. On airline-affiliated
credit cards, a cash advance doesn’t earn frequent-flier miles.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, most banks
assess a 2 percent fee above the 1 percent fee charged by Visa or
MasterCard or American Express for currency conversion on credit
charges. But credit cards still may be the smart way to go when you
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
50

factor in things like exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s check
exchange rates (and service fees).
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the
card is used numerous times in a foreign destination and block your
charges. Even if you don’t call your credit card company in advance, you
can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is
refused — a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But per-
haps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one card with
you on your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons, so
having a backup is the smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
Traveler’s checks are something of an anachronism from the days when
people wrote personal checks instead of going to an ATM. Because trav-
eler’s checks can be replaced if lost or stolen, they were a sound alterna-
tive to cash, and as long as vendors continue to accept them, they are
still a viable option to cash or banking cards. Service charges are fairly
low, or even nonexistent if you know where to go.
The best way to ensure a fair rate of exchange is to purchase your trav-
eler’s checks in Canadian dollars. You can get Canadian-currency trav-
eler’s checks at most major banks and organizations such as AAA.
American Express offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for
cardholders only) $1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 per-
cent to 4 percent. You can also get American Express traveler’s checks
over the phone by calling % 800-221-7282; Amex gold and platinum
cardholders who use this number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations throughout the United
States, as well as at several other banks. The service charge ranges
between 1.5 percent and 2 percent; checks come in denominations of
$20, $50, $100, $500, and $1,000. Call % 800-732-1322 for information.
AAA members can obtain Visa checks without a fee at most AAA offices
or by calling % 866-339-3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks.
Call % 800-223-9920 for a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Taking Taxes into Account
Two taxes are added onto almost every purchase and transaction made
in the Maritimes. (Notable exceptions include liquor and gas purchases,
which have taxes built into the posted price.) These taxes are collected
in different ways. Each province applies a Provincial Sales Tax on top of
the Canada-wide 5 percent Goods and Services (GST) Tax. In Prince
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 51

Edward Island, the provincial tax is 10 percent, for a grand total of 15
percent. In Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the provincial tax is 8 per-
cent and is blended with the GST to create what is known as a
Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) of 13 percent. So, since most prices you
see quoted do not include tax, you must factor in an extra 13 percent to
15 percent, depending on the province, to come up with a final price.
The Halifax Regional Municipality collects a 2 percent Halifax Marketing
Levy, which will be added to your Halifax hotel bill.
Dealing with Loss or Theft
While on vacation, there are few events more stressful than losing your
wallet. Though you can rarely prevent this from happening, knowing
what to do if it does occur can save you a lot of headaches.
Coping with lost credit cards
Most credit card companies have an emergency toll-free number to call
if your card is lost or stolen. They may be able to wire you a cash
advance immediately or deliver an emergency credit card in a day or
two. Make sure you have the numbers with you (but not in your wallet!)
so that, if a theft occurs, you can deal with the situation immediately.
Check the following Canadian toll-free emergency numbers and note
those that apply to you:
 American Express % 800-668-2639
 Diners Club % 800-363-3333
 Discover % 800-347-2683
 MasterCard % 800-307-7309
 Visa % 800-847-2911
Be sure to contact all of your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen. Also file a report at the nearest
police precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may require a
police report number or record of the loss.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.ca). Agents
are scattered across all three Maritime provinces; check the Web site for
locations.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
52

Losing your identity
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if your driver’s license is lost along with your cash and credit
cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately; placing a
fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability for criminal
activity. Equifax has offices around the world, including Canada (% 800-
465-7166; www.Equifax.ca) and the United States (% 800-685-1111;
www.equifax.com). Experian (% 888-397-3742; www.experiangroup.
com) and TransUnion (% 888-322-8228; www.transunion.com) are two
other U.S. agencies. Finally, if you lose all forms of photo ID call your air-
line and explain the situation; they may allow you to board the plane if
you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy of the
police report you filed.

In This Chapter
 Flying in for less
 Traveling by land or by sea
 Deciding on a escorted or package tour
T
he first steps in vacation planning can be tough. You have to make a
lot of commitments early on — and often back them up with your
hard-earned money. You probably have questions: Do you want to be
totally independent, either because you’re a control freak and can’t
stand even a single detail being out of your hands, or because you’re
into spontaneity and hate to have things prearranged? Would a self-
guided or group tour suit your needs? Which tour company can provide
the vacation you’re dreaming of? Whatever your goals, this chapter
helps you break them down and choose what you really want to do.
If you do decide on a tour, how do you find a deal? I suggest some strate-
gies in the next sections, but every embarkation point and destination
province is different, and the tour operators I mention may not offer
deals convenient to your city. If that’s the case, check with a local travel
agent, who likely has a thorough knowledge of your options and how
best to bundle packages, such as escorted tours and airline fares.
Flying to the Maritimes
The two major Canadian airlines and several U.S. carriers serve Halifax,
the main air hub for the Maritimes. You can also fly into Saint John,
Fredericton, Moncton, or Charlottetown. With plenty of competition,
prices are usually reasonable and sometimes very good.
Halifax International Airport (www.hiaa.ca), the busiest airport in the
Maritimes, handles three million passengers annually in two modern ter-
minals. Direct flights by major Canadian and U.S. airlines (Table 6.1 lists
them all) serve this airport from around 30 locations. The Web site www.
flyhalifax.com is an excellent resource that allows you to search for
flights to Halifax from specific destinations and also check flight arrival
and departure times.

If you’re Maritimes-bound from Europe, your flight will be routed
through Toronto or Montreal. Flights originating in Asia and the South
Pacific require a plane-change in Vancouver or Toronto.
Now that you know a little about who flies into the Maritimes, start
searching out the best fares. Read the advice below, and then do some
comparison shopping.
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among major airlines is unlike that of any other industry.
Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a coach seat is
a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility of last-minute changes, or
those who want to get home before the weekend, pay (or at least their
companies pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can
book your ticket far in advance, stay over a Saturday night, and are will-
ing to travel with restrictions such as non-changeable flights, you can
save big bucks.
Air Canada is taking a leading role in streamlining their fare system.
They offer four ticket options for North American flights, ranging from a
nonrefundable, non-changeable Tango ticket to a flexible Latitude ticket.
At the time of publication, a Tango one-way fare from Boston to Halifax
was US$154, while the full-fare Latitude option was US$560 for the same
flight. The difference shows that you can save a lot by accepting a few
restrictions. Go to www.aircanada.com to see more details and tools
that allow you to see easily which days have the least expensive flights.
Chapter 6: Getting to the Maritimes 55

The airlines periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices on
their most popular routes. These fares have advance purchase require-
ments and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices. As
you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, which tend
to take place in seasons of low travel volume, November to March. You
almost never see a sale around the peak summer vacation months of
July and August, or around Thanksgiving or Christmas, when many
people fly regardless of the fare they have to pay.
Booking your flight online
If you are simply buying a flight from one point to another, you can’t
beat online prices. Searching out the best online airfares can be more
time-consuming than using a travel agent, but it gives you more flexibil-
ity and you won’t be stuck with any additional charges. Most sites
prompt you to enter a departure point and destination along with your
dates of travel, so if you’re not sure of the specifics of your trip, you can
play with the variables until you find the best price. The displayed
results usually include a number of flight and fare options.
Most airlines offer online-only fares that even their phone agents know
nothing about. So if you’re flexible and ready to keep up with your online
research, you can get an excellent deal.
Travel Web sites
The “big three” online travel agencies are Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com). For
travelers already in Canada, try www.expedia.ca or www.travelocity.
ca; U.K. residents can go for www.expedia.co.uk. Each has different
business deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise.
You have many other options besides the major online travel agencies.
To sniff out great deals on airfare, check out Cheapflights (www.cheap
flights.com), SmarterTravel (www.smartertravel.com), and
Priceline (www.priceline.com), and Opodo (www.opodo.co.uk) if
you’re traveling from the U.K. Also U.K.-based is Travelsupermarket
(www.travelsupermarket.com), a flight search engine that offers flight
comparisons for the budget airlines whose seats often end up in bucket-
shop sales (I explain bucket-shop sales later in this chapter).
Consider using meta-search sites (which find and then direct you to air-
line and hotel Web sites for booking) for a cheap ticket. They include
Sidestep (www.sidestep.com) and Kayak.com. Sidestep receives good
reviews from users. It’s a browser add-on that claims to “search 140 sites
at once,” although in reality it only beats competitors’ fares as often as
other sites do. Kayak includes fares for budget carriers like JetBlue and
Spirit, as well as the major airlines.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
56

If you’re in no rush to book your vacation, you can sign up for sale alerts
at some of the major travel Web sites. Two of the big three, Expedia and
Travelocity, will send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare to
your favorite destination becomes available.
Opaque fare services
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service such as Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for
travel on an airline that will remain unknown to you until you purchase
your ticket. Be assured that the “mystery airlines” are all major, well-
known carriers, and the possibility of traveling from Detroit to Halifax
via Vancouver is remote. On the other hand, your chances of getting a 
6 a.m. or 11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices
before you buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you
have to play their “name our price” game.
Last-minute specials
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines, including Air Canada (www.aircanada.
ca). Usually, these deals are announced on a Tuesday or Wednesday, and
must be purchased online. Most are only valid for travel that weekend,
but some can be booked weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly
e-mail alerts at airline Web sites, or check mega-sites that compile com-
prehensive lists of last-minute specials, such as Smarter Travel (www.
smartertravel.com) and Webflyer (www.webflyer.com). Also,
LastMinute (www.lastminute.com) is a great source for last-minute
flights and getaways.
Watch local newspapers for promotional specials or fare wars, when
airlines lower prices on their most popular routes. Also keep an eye on
price fluctuations and deals at Web sites such as Airfarewatchdog
(www.airfarewatchdog.com) and Farecast (www.farecast.com).
Consolidators
Also known as bucket shops, consolidators are wholesale brokers in the
airline ticket game. Consolidators buy deeply discounted tickets (“dis-
tressed” inventories of unsold seats) from airlines and sell them to
online ticket agencies, travel agents, tour operators, corporations, and,
to a lesser degree, the general public.
Several reliable consolidators have worldwide locations and are avail-
able on the Internet. In the United States, STA Travel (% 800-781-4040;
www.statravel.com) is a world leader in student travel. The Canadian
equivalent is Travel Cuts (% 866-246-9762; www.travelcuts.com). In
both cases, you don’t need to be a student to take advantage of their
Chapter 6: Getting to the Maritimes 57

good fares. Flight Centre is a large consolidator with offices around the
world and competitive online fares. (In the U.S., contact them at % 866-
967-5351, www.flightcentre.us; in Canada % 877-467-5302, www.
flightcentre.ca; and the United Kingdom % 0870-499-0040; www.
flightcentre.co.uk.) London-based Trailfinders (% 0845-058-5858;
www.trailfinders.com) always has competitive fares to North
America, along with easy-to-understand rental car and hotel packages.
They also produce an informative travel magazine, or you can sign up
for their e-mail service.
On the downside, bucket shop tickets are often rigged with restrictions,
such as stiff cancellation penalties (as high as 50 percent to 75 percent
of the ticket price). And keep in mind that the availability of most of
what you see advertised is limited.
Using frequent flier miles
A frequent flier membership doesn’t cost a cent, but it can entitle you
to better seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and prompter service
if your luggage is stolen or your flight is canceled or delayed, or if you
want to change your seat. And you don’t have to fly to earn points; fre-
quent flier credit cards can earn you thousands of miles for doing your
everyday shopping. With more than 70 mileage awards programs on the
market, consumers have never had more options. Investigate the pro-
gram details of your favorite airlines before you sink points into any one.
Consider which airlines have hubs in the airport nearest you, and, of
those carriers, which have the most advantageous alliances, given your
most common routes. To play the frequent flier game to your best
advantage, consult the community bulletin boards on FlyerTalk (www.
flyertalk.com) or go to Randy Petersen’s Inside Flyer (www.inside
flyer.com). Petersen and friends review all the programs in detail and
post regular updates on changes in policies and trends.
Driving to the Maritimes
You can drive to the Maritimes via numerous highways, all of which
enter the region through New Brunswick.
 Trans-Canada Highway, which takes on different numbers as it
crosses the country, enters New Brunswick near Edmundston as
Highway 2. Using this route, it’s 1,238km (769 miles) from Montreal
to Halifax and 1,757km (1,092 miles) from Toronto to Halifax.
Planning on driving across Canada via the Trans-Canada Highway?
Gas up. It’s 6,187km (3,846 miles) from Vancouver to Halifax.
 Interstate 95 links Portland and Bangor, Maine, with the Maritimes,
crossing the Canadian border west of Fredericton at the
Houlton/Woodstock crossing.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
58

 Highway 1 winds its way along the Maine coastline to the Calais/St.
Stephen border, crossing in the southern corner of New Brunswick.
From this point, it’s 90km (56 miles) to Saint John, and a little far-
ther to Fredericton.
 Highway 189 branches off Maine’s Highway 177km (48 miles) south
of Calais. It makes for an interesting approach to New Brunswick.
At Lubec, it crosses a bridge to Campobello Island, across the
border in New Brunswick. From this point, take a short ferry ride to
Deer Island, and then another to reach the mainland. Both ferries
are summer-only.
Arriving by Other Means
Though flying is the primary means of getting to the Maritimes, some
people enjoy a road trip, or have mobility issues that make flying impos-
sible, or simply prefer not to fly. Here’s the lowdown on traveling to the
Maritimes by train, bus, and ferry.
Taking the train
VIA Rail (% 888-842-7245 or 416-366-8411; www.viarail.ca) operates
the Ocean between Montreal and Halifax up to six times weekly, with
stops in Moncton and Truro en route. The two classes of travel are
Comfort (lots of leg room, reclining seats, reading lights, pillows and
blankets, and a Skyline Car complete with bar service) and Easterly
(daytime seating, nighttime sleeping room, a domed lounge, and a dining
car for passengers in this class). A discounted Comfort Class one-way
fare between Montreal and Halifax is C$131, while the full fare in Easterly
Class is C$485. Discounts of up to 35 percent apply to bookings made
more than seven days in advance. Children, seniors, and students also
enjoy discounted travel.
If you’re planning extensive rail travel in Canada, VIA Rail’s Canrailpass
may be a worthwhile investment. It allows for unlimited rail travel
across Canada for 12 days over any given 30-day period for C$837 in
high season (June to mid-Oct) and C$523 the rest of the year.
While the Canrailpass can be a good deal if you plan to do a lot of rail
traveling, it comes with a few hitches: If you travel on the Montreal-to-
Halifax service, for example, it counts as two days of travel. So check to
see that the routes you plan to take don’t make this pass a not-so-smart
investment.
Bussing it in
Greyhound (% 800-231-2222; www.greyhound.com) operates passen-
ger buses throughout North America with only a couple of exceptions,
and one of these is the Maritimes. The good news for bus travelers is
Chapter 6: Getting to the Maritimes 59

that connections from Greyhound to the local carrier Acadian (see
Chapter 7) are seamless at gateway cities that include Montreal,
Toronto, and Bangor (Maine). You can also catch a Greyhound bus to
the Maine cities of Portland or Bar Harbor, then jump aboard a ferry to
Yarmouth (see the following section), and then rely on Acadian buses to
get you around Nova Scotia and beyond.
Acadian honors all Greyhound passes. Therefore, if you have a 7-day
Canada Discovery Pass (C$329) or a 15-day North America Discovery
Pass (US$415), no additional costs will apply to your travels within the
three Maritimes provinces. Check the Greyhound Web site for pass
options.
Arriving by ferry
A glance at a map makes it obvious that catching a ferry from Maine to
Yarmouth, on the southwestern tip of Nova Scotia, shortens the journey
considerably. The CAT (% 888-249-7245 or 902-742-6800; www.cat
ferry.com) operates along two routes: from Bar Harbor to Yarmouth
and from Portland to Yarmouth. Between mid-May and mid-October, fer-
ries run once daily from either Portland or Bar Harbor. It’s North
America’s fastest car ferry, making the journey from Bar Harbor to
Yarmouth in under three hours (a traditional ferry takes twice as long).
Fares from Bar Harbor are US$63 adults, US$58 seniors, US$43 children 5
to 17, US$125 for vehicles up to 7m (20 feet) long. The slightly higher
cost from Portland is US$89 adults, US$85 seniors, US$59 children 5 to
17, US$149 for vehicles. Discounts apply in the shoulder season. Because
this service is convenient, vessels fill fast in summer. Therefore, reserva-
tions are strongly recommended.
Joining an Escorted Tour
Say the words “escorted tour” and you may automatically feel as though
you’re being forced to choose between your money and your lifestyle.
Think again. Times — and tours — have changed.
An escorted tour does, obviously, involve an escort, but that doesn’t
mean it’s constricting. Escorted tours range from cushy bus trips, where
you sit back and let the driver worry about the traffic, to adventures
that include biking around Prince Edward Island or sea kayaking on Cape
Breton Island — situations where most of us can use a bit of guidance.
The main point is you travel with a group, which may be just the thing if
you’re single and want company. In general, your costs are taken care of
after you arrive at your destination, but you have to cover your airfare
to get there.
Many people love escorted tours. The tour company takes care of all the
details and tells you what to expect at each leg of your journey. You
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
60

know your costs upfront and, in the case of the tame tours, you don’t get
many surprises. Escorted tours can take you to the maximum number of
sights in the minimum amount of time with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the operator
doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you paid
for, you have no reason to think that it will fulfill its insurance obliga-
tions either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (I tell
you more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 10.)
When considering an escorted tour, find out if you have to put down a
deposit, and ask when final payment is due. In addition, ask a few simple
questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the operator cancel the trip if
not enough people make reservations? How late can you cancel if
you’re unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If they
cancel?
 How jampacked is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to shop
or relax by the pool? If starting your day at 7 a.m. to pack in 10 to
12 hours of nonstop sightseeing sounds like a grind, certain tours
may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The larger the group, the more time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but ask
them to give you a rough estimate.
 What is the minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
size, and may cancel if they don’t book enough people. If a quota
exists, find out what it is and how close the tour operator is to
reaching it. Again, operators may be evasive in their answers, but
the information can help you select a tour that’s sure to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to
pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks can be extra. Beer may be
included, but not wine.
 How much flexibility do you have? Can you opt out of certain
activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with no exceptions?
Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you choose your entree
at dinner, or does everybody get the same chicken cutlet?
Picking the right escorted tour is a very personal choice. I don’t pretend
to know what you like, but here are a few reputable companies (in alpha-
betical order) to get you started:
Chapter 6: Getting to the Maritimes 61

 Ambassatours (% 800-565-7173 or 902-423-6242; www.
ambassatours.com) is the Atlantic Canada arm of the Grayline
conglomerate. Typical offerings include a three-day Cape Breton
Island tour for C$880 and the Atlantic Maritimes tour that hits the
hot spots in each of the three provinces over eight days for
C$2,400.
 Backroads (% 800-462-2848 or 510-527-1555;
www.backroads.com) offers a six-day bike tour of Prince Edward
Island for US$2,698. The biking is easy, and upscale accommoda-
tions and all meals are included.
 Collette Vacations (% 800-340-5158;
www.collettevacations.com) offers many tours that include the
Maritimes. The ten-day Canada’s Atlantic Coast tour hits all three
provinces as well as Maine for US$1,749 per person.
 Horizon & Co. (% 800-387-2977 or 416-585-9911; www.horizon-
co.com) is a Canadian tour company with an excellent reputation.
Expect to pay around C$4,495 for a ten-day, all-inclusive Maritimes
cruise that begins in New York.
You can also check ads in the travel section of your local Sunday news-
paper or in the back of national travel magazines such as Travel + Leisure,
Outside, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Choosing a Package Tour
Unlike escorted tours, package tours are simply a way to buy the airfare,
accommodations, and other elements of your trip at the same time and
often at a discounted price. Some companies bundle every aspect of
your trip, including tours to various sights, but most deal just with
selected aspects. This allows you to get a good deal by putting together
an airfare and hotel arrangement, say, or a lodging and greens-fee pack-
age. Most packages tend to leave you a lot of leeway, while saving you
money.
For the Maritimes, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the price of a hotel alone that you
book yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour opera-
tors, who resell them to the public. It’s kind of like purchasing your vaca-
tion at a bulk store — except the tour operator is the one who buys the
1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them ten at a time at a cost
that undercuts the local supermarket.
Package tours can vary as much as those garbage bags, too. In a com-
parison of any two tours, one may offer a better class of hotels for the
same price, or provide the same hotels for a lower price. Some book
seats on scheduled airline flights; others sell charters. In some packages,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
62

your choice of accommodations and travel days may be limited. Some
let you choose between escorted vacations and independent vacations;
others allow you to add on just a few excursions or escorted day trips
(also at discounted prices) without booking an entirely escorted tour.
Here are some recommendations (in alphabetical order) for companies
offering package tours:
 Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.ca), Canada’s
national airline, offers packages that can be booked through travel
agents as well as an online search tool for air-car rental combos.
 Liberty Travel (% 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is one
of the biggest packagers in the U.S. Northeast. It offers separate
package tours to each of the three Maritime provinces.
 Rodd Hotels & Resorts (% 800-565-7633 or 902-892-7448; www.
roddvacations.com) is an upscale Maritimes hotel chain with golf
and “leisure” packages that usually include breakfast and passes to
local attractions.
 VIA Rail (% 888-842-7245 or 514-871-6000; www.viarail.ca) and
Canadian tour operators combine forces to offer some interesting
packages that originate in Toronto and Montreal. Go to www.train
packages.ca or click on the “Travel Planner” link on the Via Web
site for details.
 WestJet (% 877-737-7001; www.westjetvacations.com) offers its
own flights bundled with car rental-hotel packages throughout the
Maritimes.
Several big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, and
Site59 — also do a brisk business in packages.

Getting Around 
the Maritimes
In This Chapter
 Exploring the Maritimes by car

 Flying or riding the rails between provinces
S
o, you know how you’re getting to the Maritimes: Now you need to
know how to get around. This chapter covers driving (really the
only way to explore beyond the downtown core of the major cities) as
well as two important ferry routes. If you’re willing to shell out big
bucks, flying between provinces is an option, as is catching the train,
although the latter is limited in its options.
Driving Around
Unless you’re on an escorted tour, driving is the best way to get around
the Maritimes. All you need is a vehicle, a good set of maps, a full tank of
gas, and a sense of adventure.
Motoring in the Maritimes is similar to that in other parts of Canada or
in the United States. Major thoroughfares are kept in excellent condition,
and all towns and minor highways are well marked. Gas stations are reg-
ularly spaced — one in almost every town — so running out of gas isn’t
a problem if you keep an eye on the gauge. Expect to pay around C$1.10
to C$1.30 per liter (US$4.40–US$5.20 per gallon) for gas, though prices
can fluctuate quite dramatically.
Apart from other drivers, the most important thing to watch for on the
roads is wildlife, most commonly deer, moose, and bears, especially if
you’re driving at dawn or dusk. Areas with lots of animal activity are
usually signposted, but always scan both sides of the road just to make
sure. In winter, blowing snow and blizzards can make driving extremely
dangerous.

Wearing a seat belt is compulsory in Canada, and the fine for not wear-
ing one is steep. Most drivers voluntarily travel with their headlights on
at all times; motorcyclists are required by law to ride with their lights
on. Traffic in both directions must stop when school buses have their
red lights flashing. Pedestrians have the right of way at crosswalks.
Renting a car
The good news is that every major car rental company is represented in
the Maritimes, so you can easily shop around for the best deal. The bad
news is that demand is high during the peak summer months (mid-June
to early Sept), so prices can be high. Rental car companies and their
contact numbers and Web sites are listed in the Appendix.
Getting the best deal
Car rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the vehicle, the length of time you keep it, where and when
you pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other fac-
tors. The following tips can help save you hundreds of dollars:
 Check your rental car company’s weekend rates — they may be
lower than the weekday rates. If you’re keeping the car for five or
more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the daily rate.
 Ask about drop-off conditions: Some companies may add a drop-off
charge if you don’t return the car to the same rental location.
 Rent your vehicle from some place other than the airport. At
Halifax International Airport, for example, a Concession Recovery
Fee adds 11.73 percent to all airport rentals. To save this charge,
rent a vehicle at one of dozens of downtown agencies.
 Find out whether age is an issue. Many car rental companies add
on a fee for drivers under 25, while some don’t rent to them at all.
 If you see an advertised price in your local newspaper, be sure to
ask for that specific rate; otherwise, you may be charged the stan-
dard (higher) rate. Don’t forget to mention membership in AAA,
AARP, and trade unions. These memberships usually entitle you to
discounts ranging from 5 percent to 30 percent.
 Check your frequent flier accounts. Airlines often team up with
rental car companies to offer you incentives to use their services.
Not only are your favorite (or at least most-used) airlines likely to
have sent you discount coupons, but major car rental companies
usually add at least 500 air miles to your account.
 As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can
make comparison shopping for a car rental much easier. You can
check rates at most of the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all the
major travel sites, such as Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and
Chapter 7: Getting Around the Maritimes 65

Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com), have search engines
that can dig up discounted car rental rates. Just enter the car size
you want, the pickup and return dates, and the location, and the
server returns a price. You can even make the reservation through
any of these sites.
Adding up the charges
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges apply to
most car rentals (along with some not-so-optional charges, such as
taxes). The Loss Damage Waiver (LDW), which requires you to pay for
damage to the car in a collision, is covered by many credit card compa-
nies. Check with your credit card company before you go, to see if you
can avoid paying this hefty fee (as much as C$30 a day).
The car rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal effects protection (if your lug-
gage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your vehicle at
home probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if
your own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have
auto insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your car
rental agent for more information). Unless you’re toting around the Hope
diamond (and you wouldn’t leave that in your trunk anyway), you can
probably skip the personal effects insurance, but driving around without
liability or personal accident coverage is never a good idea. Even if
you’re a good driver, other people may not be, and liability claims can
be complicated.
Most companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for your
initial full tank of gas upfront and then return the car with an empty gas
tank. The prices are usually competitive with local gas prices, but you
don’t get credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this
option, you pay only for the gas you use, but you have to return the car
with a full tank or face charges that are around 50 percent higher per
liter than at the pump to make up for the shortfall. If you tend to run late
and a fueling stop may make you miss your plane, you’re a good candi-
date for the fuel-purchase option.
Ferrying Between Provinces
The three provinces are linked not only by road (or bridge, in the case of
PEI) but also by ferry. This is a fun, affordable way to travel while cutting
down on driving.
Nova Scotia to New Brunswick
The ferry across the Bay of Fundy between Digby, Nova Scotia, and Saint
John, New Brunswick, can cut a considerable chunk from your driving
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
66

mileage if your itinerary takes you either up the Maine coast (and you
didn’t use the ferry systems detailed in Chapter 6) or on a circuitous
route through both Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
The Princess of Acadia plies this route year-round, with up to three
sailings daily, depending on the season. The trip takes three hours and is
C$30 to C$40 for adults, C$25 to C$30 for seniors, C$20 to C$25 for chil-
dren 5 to 17, and C$95 to C$100 for vehicles under 6.4m (21 feet). Fare
variations reflect seasonal pricing (July to early Oct is high season).
Contact Bay Ferries (% 888-249-7245 or 506-649-7777; www.bay
ferries.com) for information and reservations.
Nova Scotia to Prince Edward Island
Although Prince Edward Island is linked to mainland New Brunswick by
a bridge, the ferry link between Caribou (north of Pictou, Nova Scotia)
and Wood Islands (on the southeastern corner of PEI) is also a viable
way of crossing Northumberland Strait.
In July and August, the ferry offers eight sailings daily in each direction,
with less frequent service in spring and fall. Drifting ice closes the serv-
ice down completely between mid-December and April. Once the vessel
gets going, the crossing takes little more than an hour. The round-trip
fare is C$59 per vehicle including passengers. For walk-on passengers,
the cost is C$14 for adults, C$12 for seniors; no charge for children
under five. For information, contact Northumberland Ferries (% 902-
566-3838; www.peiferry.com). No reservations are taken, so plan on
catching a mid-week (except Fri afternoon) or early morning sailing to
avoid a long wait.
Getting to Prince Edward Island is free, regardless of whether you cross
the Confederation Bridge or take the ferry. The bridge toll and ferry fare
are only collected when you leave the island. The bridge toll (C$41 for all
two-axle vehicles) is less expensive than traveling by ferry, so if you
cross to the island aboard the ferry and return to the mainland via the
bridge, you’ll save a bit of money.
To Newfoundland
I didn’t forget about Newfoundland when writing this book. But covering
the three Maritime provinces as well as their northern neighbor in the
amount of space available is simply impossible. (Collectively, the
province of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Maritime provinces are
known as Atlantic Canada.)
For those who plan on visiting Newfoundland, this section details ferry
routes and rates from Nova Scotia.
Marine Atlantic (% 800-341-7981 or 902-794-5200; www.marine-
atlantic.ca) operates the following ferries between North Sydney and
the Newfoundland docks (reservations are required for all sailings):
Chapter 7: Getting Around the Maritimes 67

 Port aux Basques, located at the southwestern tip of
Newfoundland. This ferry ride takes between five and seven hours,
with departures twice daily year-round. Costs are (one-way) C$28
for adults, C$25 for seniors, and C$14 for children 5 to 12. Vehicles
up to 20 feet in length cost C$78, and accommodations range from
a dorm bed for C$16 to C$99 for a four-berth cabin.
 Argentia, situated a couple of hours’ drive from the capital, St.
John’s (not to be confused with Saint John, New Brunswick). This
route is much longer and more of an adventure, taking around 16
hours and crossing sometimes-rough open ocean. Ferries depart
twice a week between mid-June and mid-October. Sample one-way
fares are: C$77 adults, C$70 seniors, C$39 children 5 to 12, C$18
reclining chair, C$28 dorm bed, C$138 four-berth cabin, and C$161
for vehicles up to 20 feet in length.
Before leaving home, request an information package from
Newfoundland and Labrador Tourism (% 800-563-6353 or
709-729-2830; www.newfoundlandlabrador.com). The recommended
guidebook is Frommer’s Newfoundland and Labrador.
Getting Around by Other Means
If you aren’t on an escorted tour and don’t want to drive, your options
for travel in the Maritimes are limited to flying between provinces, catch-
ing the train along one of two main routes, or taking the bus.
Traveling by plane
Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.ca) flies daily between
Halifax, Moncton, Fredericton, Saint John, Charlottetown, and Sydney. At
each of these airports, you find transportation to downtown, car rental
desks, and an information booth or a bank of phones linked to a direc-
tory of local accommodations.
Taking the train
VIA Rail (% 888-842-7245 or 514-871-6000; www.viarail.ca) service
between Montreal and Halifax stops in Truro, Moncton, Miramichi, and
Bathurst, making it a viable intraprovincial transportation option. From
the railway station in Moncton, bus connections can be made to
Charlottetown, Saint John, and Fredericton. Fares are reasonable, espe-
cially if purchased seven or more days in advance.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
68

Catching the bus
As I say in the previous chapter, Greyhound services come close to the
Maritimes, but terminate at surrounding cities such as Bangor (Maine),
Toronto, and Montreal. From downtown depots in these three places,
Acadian (% 800-567-5151 or 902-454-9321; www.acadianbus.com) pro-
vides connecting services to major Maritimes centers and hundreds of
towns and villages in between. Acadian services cross the Confederation
Bridge to Charlottetown, but beyond the capital there is no public trans-
portation on Prince Edward Island.

Booking Your
Accommodations
In This Chapter
 Choosing the best overnight option
 Wheeling and dealing for a good night’s sleep
F
inding accommodations that meet the basic criteria of being clean
and comfortable is easy — the Maritimes has all the chain hotels
and motels you already know. But unless you’re traveling there to have
the same experience you can have anywhere else, consider my recom-
mended lodgings in Chapters 11 to 21. The chains are sure to lack
Maritimes charm, which is why I recommend them only when you have
no other options.
Finding the Place That’s Right for You
People have different ideas about the type of places they want to stay at,
so no lodging I recommend in this book will appeal to everyone. I include
a wide cross section of options to suit all tastes and budgets — not hard
to do, as the Maritimes has everything from big-city luxury hotels to
rustic wilderness cabins. And compared to other North American desti-
nations, hotel rooms in the Maritimes are reasonably priced.
Remember to add taxes to all quoted prices — the 13 percent
Harmonized Sales Tax in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick and 15 percent
worth of taxes on Prince Edward Island. Halifax accommodations also
collect a 2 percent Halifax Marketing Levy.
Hotels and motels
You can find a plethora of luxury hotels in the major cities. Most interna-
tional chains are represented in each province, along with Fairmont
Hotels and Resorts (www.fairmont.com) and Delta Hotels (www.delta
hotels.com), both upscale Canadian chains with impeccable creden-
tials. These hotels have rack rates in the top $$$$ (over C$225) category,
but generally offer discounts on weekends or for online bookings.

Reliable mid-priced chains like Holiday Inn (www.ichotelsgroup.com)
and Best Western (www.bestwestern.com) are also plentiful. The
Maritimes’ own Rodd Hotels & Resorts (www.rodd-hotels.ca) is in this
same $$-to-$$$ price bracket. On the edge of the cities and in smaller
towns, you can find hotels in the middle of the $$ category. Their rooms
usually come with fewer amenities and the furnishings may be older.
If you just need somewhere to spend the night or you can’t get a room at
one of my recommended lodgings, a roadside motel will do. Access to
the room is normally from the parking lot. In general, motels don’t have
attached dining rooms. They are common throughout the Maritimes,
other than in Prince Edward Island. Always in the $ or $$ range but
rarely over C$100, they’re listed in provincial tourism guides, or their
brochures are displayed in local information centers.
Bed-and-breakfasts
Some travelers plan their vacations around bed-and-breakfasts; others
avoid them like the plague. If you fall into the first category, you have
plenty of scope in the Maritimes. Literally hundreds of homes in each of
the three provinces have been converted to bed-and-breakfast accom-
modations, with a wide range of services and prices to match (anywhere
from C$50 to over C$200 double). By doing some research and asking
the right questions, you can easily avoid unpleasant surprises. If you
follow my recommendations, you won’t have to worry about ending up
in a room left vacant by the owner’s college-bound kid. My picks are all
proper businesses with more than two guest rooms, not individuals
looking to rent an extra room to make some quick cash.
Bed-and-breakfasts are a great place to meet fellow travelers, learn more
about the area from knowledgeable hosts, and enjoy a hearty breakfast
before hitting the road. A perceived lack of privacy puts most people off
this type of accommodations. Most North American travelers don’t
relish the idea of sharing a bathroom with other guests — which isn’t
the case at all bed-and-breakfasts. Here are the accepted definitions (I
use them throughout this book), but always double-check when reserv-
ing your room so you know exactly what you’re getting:
 En suite bathroom: A bathroom that is accessed directly from the
guest room, and only used by the guests in that room.
 Private bathroom: A bathroom that is for the sole use of one room,
but may be down a hallway.
 Shared bathroom: A bathroom that is used by guests in more than
one room.
If you’re traveling with children or have a disability, be sure to make the
proprietor aware of your situation before making a reservation. Other
guests may not appreciate children (since they may be vacationing from
their own kids!). Many bed-and-breakfasts are converted residences, so
wheelchair access is often limited.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 71

Cottages, cabins, and chalets
This type of accommodations is perfect for families or those who don’t
need the luxuries of resort living.
The words “cabin” and “cottage” are mostly interchangeable, but “cot-
tage” sounds somehow more inviting (sort of like using “home” rather
than “house”). Either way, you can expect a free-standing unit with a
bathroom and linen provided. Some may have extras like a kitchen or a
private veranda. Generally, a chalet is a larger unit with more amenities
and some attention to décor.
Many cabin resorts predate World War II and became increasingly popu-
lar as families began to vacation together in the coastal resort towns.
These old cabins, loaded with character, remain; some have been com-
bined with newer and bigger units to suit a wider range of budgets and
needs, and feature facilities that may include a restaurant or canoe
rentals. For this reason, pricing runs the full spectrum. A good example
is Glenghorm Beach Resort on Cape Breton Island (www.capebreton
resorts.com), where the most basic cabins are at the bottom end of 
the $$ price range while luxurious chalets cost well into the top $$$$ cat-
egory at C$399.
Expect older, more basic cabins to be in the $ category (under C$75).
The addition of cooking facilities doesn’t usually affect the price that
much, with many self-contained cabins costing around C$100. By the
time you reach the $$$ category, you’re getting a modern, self-contained
cabin with a separate bedroom.
Cabins and cottages are priced seasonally throughout the Maritimes,
with peak season in July and August. Many close completely after
September and reopen in April or May.
Resorts
While most hotels and motels are set up for overnight stays, resorts are
designed to keep you happy for an entire vacation. The Maritimes’ top
resorts do this well, with golf courses, activity programs, spa services,
and a choice of dining rooms. Resorts are generally kid-friendly, with
children’s programs and menus as well as babysitting services.
Of course, you pay for all this pampering. Rack rates at most resorts are
in the $$$-to-$$$$ range, with decent savings for booking a package that
may include meals or greens fees. Resorts are the first to offer discounts
outside of summer, so look for bargains in June and September, when
the property is still functioning fully. My resort recommendations are
spread liberally throughout this book, but the Web sites for Rodd Hotels
and Resorts (www.rodd-hotels.ca), Cape Breton Resorts (www.cape
bretonresorts.com), and Signature Resorts (www.signatureresorts.
com) are a good place to decide if this type of accommodations seems
suited to your needs.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
72

Finding the Best Room Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be
pleasantly surprised.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them is how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (The hotel often gives the
agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her business toward
that hotel.)
Shopping early for the greatest choice
If you’re planning on traveling to the Maritimes in summer, start booking
your lodging at the beginning of the year. Some chain hotels sell a per-
centage of rooms at a discounted rate, and when they’re gone, they’re
gone — everyone else pays a higher rate. Booking early doesn’t get you
a discount at that quaint little bed-and-breakfast, but it ensures that you
get the room you want, rather than, say, their smallest room with a bath-
room down the hallway, which is always last to go.
Traveling off-peak
As shown as an example in Chapter 5, Lakeview Lodge & Cottages, in
Cavendish on Prince Edward Island, rents self-contained cottages for
C$127 in July and August. If you make your booking outside of this
period — even for the first week of September — the rate drops to C$85.
In June and September, the rate drops even further, to C$65, an almost
50% savings. The difference isn’t always this abrupt — many accommo-
dations discount a bit during “shoulder season” (June and Sept), then
further discount rates the rest of the year (or close altogether).
Luxury hotels and big resorts often charge less than half their peak rates
during the off season, which often puts them in competition with
midrange chain hotels. Check the Web sites of the major chains as well
as of Canadian companies such as Delta Hotels (www.deltahotels.
com) and Rodd Hotels and Resorts (www.rodd-hotels.ca), who lead
the way in this regard.
Refer to Chapter 3 for more information on what you can expect during
different times of year in the Maritimes.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 73

Asking for discounts
Hotels usually offer discounts for people with travel club or other mem-
berships. In most cases, you can expect a 10 percent to 15 percent dis-
count simply for flashing your AAA card. Going gray has its advantages
too — Best Western offers an automatic 10 percent discount to all travel-
ers over 55, with upgrades, late checkouts, and complimentary break-
fasts thrown in for good measure. Most major hotel chains have loyalty
programs, but usually you don’t really need to be loyal to reap the bene-
fits. Members of Holiday Inn’s Priority Club and Fairmont’s President
Club, for example, enjoy daily papers, free local calls, late checkouts,
and more, simply for signing up.
Guesthouses and bed-and-breakfasts are a little different. You can ask for
a discount if you want to stay more than one night or pay with cash, but
don’t push it.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: You can
book through the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent book-
ing agency (or a fare-service agency like Priceline). These Internet hotel
agencies have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers of late, competing
for the business of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations
around the world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers
who have the patience and time to shop and compare the online sites
for good deals — but shop they must, because prices can vary consider-
ably from site to site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s
listing may be there for no reason other than that they paid money to
get the placement.
Web sites of the chain hotels (see the Appendix) are the best place to
search out discounted rates (“Web savers,” advance bookings, and last-
minute deals). Another way to pay less for your room is to have it bun-
dled as a package with an activity like golfing or with passes to a local
attraction. Refer to Chapter 6 for discussion on booking a package.
For smaller places, check out BBCanada (www.bbcanada.com) and
Innsite (www.innsite.com), which list independent establishments you
may not otherwise find on your own. Although you can’t book online
through these sites, you can follow the links to individual lodgings’ Web
sites and book directly with them.
Although the major travel booking sites, such as Travelocity
(www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.expedia.com), and Orbitz
(www.orbitz.com), offer hotel bookings, you may be better off going
directly to the source and booking online with the property itself. Also
reliable are Hotels.ca (www.hotels.ca) and Quikbook.com (www.
quikbook.com). An excellent free program, TravelAxe (www.travel
axe.com) can help you search multiple hotel sites at once — even ones
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes

you may never have heard of — and conveniently lists the total price of
the room, including the taxes and service charges.
It happens: Travelers arrive at the hotel after making reservations
through an online intermediary, and are told that they have no reserva-
tion. To be fair, many of the major sites are undergoing improvements in
service and ease of use, and Expedia will soon be able to plug directly
into the reservations systems of many hotel chains — none of which can
be bad news for consumers. In the meantime, get a confirmation
number and make a printout of any online booking transaction.
Getting the most for your money
Now you know how to wrangle a great price, but how about the quality
of the room? When making your reservation, ask a couple of pointed
questions to make sure you get the best room in the house. Here are
some tips that can help, whatever lodging you choose:
 Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter, and
have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t
always cost more.
 Avoid renovations. If the hotel is renovating, request a room away
from the work. Of course, they probably won’t offer up this infor-
mation when you’re making your reservation, so you have to ask.
 Inquire about the location of the hotel’s restaurants and bars.
This can go either way — fine if you want to be close to the action,
but if sleep is what you’re after, the hotel’s hot nightspots are
potential sources of annoying noise.
If you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the front
desk. If they have another room, they’re usually happy to accommodate
you, within reason.

Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
If you have enough trouble getting your kids out of the house in the
morning, dragging them thousands of miles away may seem like an
insurmountable challenge. But family travel can be immensely reward-
ing, giving you new ways of seeing the world through more youthful
eyes.
Here are a few pre-trip planning tips for families:
 Look for the Kid-Friendly icon. I mark lodgings, restaurants, and
attractions especially suited to children throughout the book.
 Read books set in the Maritimes. Books such as Anne of Green
Gables are a great introduction to the Maritimes, and kids will love
visiting Cavendish after reading about it (as do thousands of
adults).
 Surf the Internet. Each of the three provincial tourism Web sites
has a section devoted to family travel, including kid-friendly attrac-
tions or ideas for entire vacations.

Internet Web sites have good family-oriented vacation advice, like
Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com), a compre-
hensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family Travel
Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), which offers travel
features, message boards, deals, and tips; Traveling Internationally
with Your Kids (www.travelwithyourkids.com), a comprehensive
site that offers customized trip planning; and Family Travel Files
(www.familytravelfiles.com), which offers an online magazine
and a directory of off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for
families.
 Pack favorite toys and games. Something simple from home can
act as a security blanket for a child traveling in a strange place.
 Reserve a child-safety seat. If your kids are small, be sure to
arrange a car seat for your rental car.
Making Age Work for You: Advice for Seniors
Mention the fact that you’re a senior citizen when you make your travel
reservations. Many hotels still offer discounts for seniors. In most cities,
people over the age of 60 qualify for reduced admission to theaters,
museums, and other attractions, as well as discounted fares on public
transportation.
Members of AARP, 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-
2277 or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares,
and car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including
AARP: The Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056 or 978-323-4141; www.elderhostel.org)
arranges study programs for those aged 55 and over (and a spouse or
companion of any age) in more than 80 countries around the world,
including Canada. The courses in Nova Scotia last five to ten days, and
many include accommodations (in modest inns), meals, and tuition.
I recommend these publications that offer travel resources and dis-
counts for seniors:
 Travel 50 & Beyond, the quarterly magazine (www.travel50and
beyond.com)
 Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures for the Mature
Traveler (Avalon Travel Publishing) and its associated Web site,

Accessing the Maritimes: Advice 
for Travelers with Disabilities
The options and resources available to travelers with disabilities are
greater than ever before, allowing almost anyone to enjoy a vacation to
the Maritimes.
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005; www.flying
wheelstravel.com) is a full-service travel agency that caters exclusively
to travelers with disabilities. Similarly, Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-
4537 or 610-521-0339; www.disabilitytravel.com) accommodates the
travel needs of slow walkers and wheelchair travelers and their families
and friends. The Access-Able Travel Source (www.access-able.com) is

travelers with disabilities.
The following organizations offer assistance to travelers with disabilities:
 The Moss Rehab Hospital (www.mossresourcenet.org) provides
an online library of accessible-travel resources.
 The Society for Accessible Travel & Hospitality (% 212-447-7284;
www.sath.org; annual membership fees: US$49 adults, US$29 sen-
iors and students) offers a wealth of travel resources for people
with all types of disabilities, as well as informed recommendations
on destinations, access guides, travel agents, tour operators, vehi-
cle rentals, and companion services.
 The American Foundation for the Blind (% 800-232-5463;

Advice for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
The university cities of Halifax, Fredericton, and Charlottetown tend to
have the most resources in the Maritimes for gay and lesbian travelers.
These centers don’t have gay or lesbian neighborhoods, but they do
have specific hangouts, like nightclubs, coffee shops, and bookstores.
Outside of the cities, attitudes are generally conservative but accepting.
A good source of gay- and lesbian-friendly businesses in Halifax, includ-
ing accommodations and restaurants, is the Web site http://gay.
hfxns.org. Gay Crawler (www.gaycrawler.com) is a search engine
with a searchable database of over 17,000 gay-themed Web sites, many
of which are travel-related. The International Gay & Lesbian Travel
Association (IGLTA; % 800-448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org)
is the trade association for the gay and lesbian travel industry, and
offers an online directory of gay- and lesbian-friendly travel businesses.
A search feature makes finding local businesses easy.
Some companies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically for gay
and lesbian travelers. One of these is Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951 or
415-626-1169; www.nowvoyager.com), a well-known San Francisco-based
gay-owned and -operated travel service.
The following travel guides are available at most travel bookstores and
gay and lesbian bookstores, or you can order them from Giovanni’s
Room bookstore, 345 South 12th St., Philadelphia (% 215-923-2960;
www.giovannisroom.com):
 Out and About (www.outandabout.com) offers online travel
guides and a monthly newsletter packed with solid information on
the global gay and lesbian scene.
 Spartacus International Gay Guide (Bruno Gmünder Verlag;
www.spartacusworld.com/gayguide/) and Odysseus (www.
odyusa.com) are both good, annual English-language guidebooks
focused on gay men.
 The Damron (www.damron.com) guides feature separate annual
books for gay men and lesbians.

on’t you hate that feeling that you’ve forgotten something but can’t
remember what it is? In this chapter, I discuss a variety of often-
overlooked planning elements. So relax and read on — you’re all covered.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. You can’t cross an international border without it. Getting a
passport is easy, but the process takes some time. U.S. citizens can find
an up-to-date country-by-country listing of passport requirements
around the world on the “Foreign Entry Requirement” Web page of the
U.S. State Department Web site (www.travel.state.gov).
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application. You can do this in person at a
U.S. passport office; a federal, state, or probate court; or a major
post office. To find your regional passport office, either check the
U.S. State Department Web site (www.travel.state.gov) or call
the Passport Services Office (% 877-487-2778) for automated
information.

2. Present a certified birth certificate. This is proof of citizenship.
(Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or social
security card is also a good idea.)
3. Submit two identical passport-sized photos. They should measure
2 × 2 inches in size. You often find businesses that take these
photos near a passport office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a
photo-vending machine because the pictures aren’t identical.
4. Pay a fee. For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten years
and costs US$97. For those 15 and under, a passport is valid for five
years and costs US$82.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing
normally takes three weeks, but can take longer during busy periods
(especially spring).
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the
past 15 years (and you were over age 16 when it was issued), you can
renew the passport by mail for US$67. Whether you’re applying in person
or by mail, you can download passport applications from the U.S. State
Department Web site at www.travel.state.gov. To find your regional
passport office, either check the U.S. State Department Web site or call
the Passport Services Office’s toll-free number (% 877-487-2778) for
automated information.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers more information for citizens of Australia, New
Zealand, and the United Kingdom.
 Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call the
Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free from
Australia), or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details on how
and where to apply.
 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download it from their Web site. For
information, contact the Passport Office at % 0800-225-050 in
New Zealand or 04-474-8100, or log on to
www.passports.govt.nz.
 United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard
ten-year passport (five-year passport for children under 16) at
passport offices, major post offices, or travel agencies. For informa-
tion, contact Identity & Passport Service (% 0870-521-0410;
www.ips.gov.uk).
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 81

Packing for the Maritimes
To be succinct, pack as lightly as possible but be prepared for a variety
of weather conditions. Start by assembling all the clothing you think
you’ll need. Then put half away, and you have an ideal amount for your
vacation.
Knowing what to bring
Pack clothing that is comfortable and practical. In summer, a rain jacket,
sweater, and a pair of worn-in walking shoes are sufficient accompani-
ments to your regular casual clothing choices. Pack fragile items between
layers of clothes, and pack things that may leak, like shampoo bottles, in
sealable bags. Also remember to bring the following:
 Tickets, rental car and hotel confirmations
 Discount membership cards
 Credit and debit cards
 Prescription medications and a copy of your prescriptions in case
you lose them or run out
Though these are not really essential (believe it or not, you can buy film
in the Maritimes, too), here’s a list of handy items that are good to have
on hand:
 Open-toed shoes, such as sandals
 Binoculars
 Spare film and batteries for your camera
 Insect repellent
 Extra pair of contacts or glasses and a copy of your prescription
Knowing what not to bring
Disregard everything you’ve heard about Canada and the cold. In
summer, you have no need to carry a down parka or heavy winter boots
(as proof, refer to Chapter 3 for average Maritimes temperatures). You
can make due with comfortable, casual spring and summer clothing. And
unless you plan on attending the theater or dining in the finest restau-
rants, you don’t need a suit or formal wear either. Khakis and a golf shirt
for men, and dress slacks or a skirt for women, are sufficiently dressy.
Meeting airline baggage requirements
Security measures at airports vary from country to country and even
from airport to airport. All major airlines include up-to-date lists of per-
mitted and prohibited items, as well as procedures for boarding flights,
on their Web sites. Another option is to go straight to the source:
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
82

 United States: Transportation Security Administration, www.
tsa.gov
 Canada: Canadian Air Transport Security Authority, www.catsa-
acsta.gc.ca
If you need to have medical equipment like syringes or oxygen bottles
on your person when you fly, contact your airline at least seven days
prior to your departure.
Checked bags
Most airlines allow each passenger two pieces of checked luggage at no
charge. Maximum weights and dimensions vary with each airline, but Air
Canada’s guidelines are typical. They allow a maximum measurement
(combined length, height, and width) of 160 centimeters (63 inches) for
each piece. The weight of each piece must not exceed 23 kilograms (50
pounds). Bags weighing between 23 kilograms (50 pounds) and 32 kilo-
grams (70 pounds) incur a C$50 surcharge.
Sporting equipment like golf clubs, skis, and snowboards is allowed at
no extra cost, but counts as one of your two checked bags. Larger items
like bikes and surfboards incur an extra charge. In addition to counting
as one of your two checked items, Air Canada charges C$50 each way for
every oversize bag. Contact your airline for more details.
On flights originating in the U.S., checked luggage is often screened by
hand. Therefore, make sure your luggage isn’t locked when you check in.
If you’re transporting a gift (as either checked-in or carry-on luggage)
and it’s wrapped, you may be required to unwrap it. So plan ahead, and
carry the wrapping paper separately.
In addition to an identification tag, tying a piece of ribbon to your suit-
case makes spotting it on the baggage carousel easy. I’ve seen a dozen
bags come off the same flight with yellow ribbon, so be creative and tie
yellow and red, or a combination of colors that represent your country
or favorite football team.
Carry-on luggage
Every airline is different when it comes to carry-on luggage allowances,
but Air Canada’s guidelines, once again, are typical. Each passenger is
allowed one carry-on bag that measures less than 55 × 40 × 23 centime-
ters (21 × 16 × 9 inches) and weighs a maximum of 10 kilograms (22
pounds), and one “personal article” (like a laptop computer or briefcase).
Items like cameras and coats are allowed but aren’t included in the
allowance. Check with your airline (Web sites are easiest) for specifics.
In your carry-on bag, pack valuables like jewelry and cameras; docu-
ments such as return tickets and car rental reservations; prescription
drugs; and a sweater. Throw in a magazine or good book, and a snack for
good measure.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 83

Keep your boarding pass and photo identification (passport or driver
license) handy at all times after checking in your main bags.
Getting through Immigration and Customs
Canada is a welcoming country, but officers at the border are still likely
to ask some pointed questions, like the purpose of your stay and what
you’re bringing into the country.
Crossing the border
All foreign visitors require a valid passport to enter Canada and will be
asked to produce onward tickets and sufficient funds when they arrive
in Canada. At press time, the U.S. government was developing alterna-
tives to the traditional passport. For current information, visit
www.travel.state.gov/travel. If you’re driving your own vehicle
across the border, be sure you have you vehicle’s registration papers.
Citizens from some countries are required to apply for a Temporary
Resident Visa (TRV) before arriving in Canada. For details, as well as
contact information for consulates and embassies around the world,
contact Citizenship and Immigration Canada (% 888-242-2100; www.
cic.gc.ca). (If you’re from the U.S., Britain, a Commonwealth country,
or somewhere in Western Europe, you probably don’t need a TRV, but
check current regulations on Citizenship and Immigration’s Web site
before leaving home.)
If you travel with a passport, keep it with you at all times. Only give it up
at the border for officers to examine. If you lose your passport while in
Canada, go directly to the nearest embassy or consulate of your own
country.
Passing through Customs
Although the amount of loot you can take into Canada is unlimited, the
Customs authority does have limits on how much you can bring in for
free (to separate the tourists from the importers).
Entering Canada
If you’re bringing goods other than clothing and personal effects into
Canada, you need to fill out a declarations form. Here’s the threshold on
some common items: 50 cigars, 200 cigarettes, and either 1.14 liters (40
ounces) of liquor or wine or one case (12 bottles or cans) of beer.
Bringing more than the equivalent of C$10,000 into Canada is not illegal,
but you must report it if you do so.
Temporary visitors are permitted to bring their pet cat or dog into
Canada without it being quarantined. The department responsible for
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
84

overseeing the import of animals is the Canada Food Inspection Agency
(www.inspection.gc.ca). Check their Web site for current regulations.
Revolvers, pistols, and fully automatic firearms are definitely not
allowed, and, needless to say, neither are narcotics. For more informa-
tion, contact the Canada Firearms Centre (% 800-731-4000; www.cfc-
cafc.gc.ca). For more information on general Customs regulations,
check with the Canada Border Services Agency (% 800-461-9999 or
204-983-3500; www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca).
Returning home
If you’re a citizen of the United States, you may bring home US$400
worth of goods duty-free, providing you’ve been out of the country at
least 48 hours. This includes one liter of an alcoholic beverage, 200 ciga-
rettes, and 100 cigars. You may mail up to US$200 worth of goods to
yourself (marked “for personal use”) and up to US$100 to others
(marked “unsolicited gift”) once each day. You have to pay an import
duty on anything over these limits.
If you have further questions, or you’d like a list of specific items that
you cannot bring into the United States, check the U.S. Customs and
Border Protection Web site, www.cbp.gov.
Customs regulations are different in every country. Here are some con-
tacts for returning citizens of other countries:
 Australian Customs Service (% 1300-363-263; www.customs.
gov.au).
 HM Revenue & Customs (% 0845-010-9000; www.hmrc.gov.uk)
for the United Kingdom.
 New Zealand Customs Service (% 0800-428-786; www.customs.
govt.nz).
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. You can check the
average wait times at your airport by going to the Transportation
Security Administration (TSA) Security Checkpoint Wait Times Web site
(www.waittime.tsa.dhs.gov). Generally, you’ll be fine if you arrive at
the airport one hour before a domestic flight and two hours before an
international flight. If you show up late, tell an airline employee and
she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Besides arriving on time, here are a few other ways to make your time at
the airport go smoothly.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 85

 Bring a current passport. Keep this ID at the ready to show at
check-in, the security checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate.
(Children under 18 do not need government-issued photo IDs 
for domestic flights, but they do for international flights to most
countries.)
 Know what you can carry on and what you can’t. For the latest
updates on items you are prohibited to bring in carry-on luggage,
go to www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel.
 Beat the ticket-counter lines. Use the self-service electronic ticket
kiosks at the airport or even print out your boarding pass at home
from the airline Web site. Using curbside check-in is also a smart
way to avoid lines.
 Help speed up security before you’re screened. Remove jackets,
shoes, belt buckles, heavy jewelry, and watches and place them
either in your carry-on luggage or the security bins provided. Place
keys, coins, cellphones, and pagers in a security bin. If you have
metallic body parts, carry a note from your doctor.
 Use a TSA-approved lock for your checked luggage. Sold at lug-
gage or travel shops and Brookstone stores (or online at www.
brookstone.com), these locks can be opened with a master key 
by airport security, but deter casual thieves.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
The cost of travel insurance varies widely, depending on the cost and
length of your trip, your age and health, and the type of trip you’re
taking, but expect to pay between 5 percent and 8 percent of the vaca-
tion itself. You can get estimates from various providers through
InsureMyTrip (insuremytrip.com). Enter information such as your 
trip cost, travel dates, and your age to get prices from more than a
dozen companies.
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip cancellation, medical,
and lost luggage. Here’s my advice on all three:
 Trip cancellation insurance is a good idea if you signed up for an
escorted tour and paid a large portion of your vacation expenses
upfront (for information on escorted tours, refer to Chapter 6). Trip
cancellation insurance covers three types of emergencies: death or
sickness that prevents you from traveling, bankruptcy of a tour
operator or airline, or a disaster that prevents you from getting to
your destination.
 For travel overseas, most health plans (including Medicare and
Medicaid) do not provide coverage, and the ones that do often
require you to pay for services upfront and reimburse you only
Part II: Planning Your Trip to the Maritimes 
86

after you return home. As a safety net, you may want to buy travel
medical insurance from a company such as MEDEX (% 410-453-
6300; www.medexassist.com) or Travel Assistance International
(% 800-821-2828; www.travelassistance.com).
 Lost luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. Your
homeowner’s or renter’s insurance should cover stolen luggage if
you have off-premises theft coverage. Check your existing policies
before you buy any additional coverage. On international flights
(including U.S. portions of international trips), baggage coverage is
limited to approximately US$9.07 per pound, up to approximately
US$635 per checked bag. If you plan to check items more valuable
than what’s covered by the standard liability, see if your home-
owner’s policy covers your valuables, or get baggage insurance as
part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the air-
port, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must report
delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of arrival. The air-
lines are required to deliver luggage, once found, directly to your house
or destination free of charge.
Don’t pay for more insurance than you need. For example, if you need
only trip cancellation insurance, don’t buy coverage for lost or stolen
property. Trip cancellation insurance costs about 6 percent to 8 percent
of the total value of your vacation.
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it (of
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you).
If you have health insurance, be sure to carry your insurance card in
your wallet. Most U.S. health insurance plans and HMOs cover at least
part of the out-of-country hospital visits and procedures if insureds
become ill or are injured while out of the country. Most require that you
pay the bills upfront at the time of care, issuing a refund only after you
return and file all the paperwork.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert Identification Tag (% 888-633-4298 or 209-668-
3333; www.medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your
condition and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s
24-hour hot line. Contact the International Association for Medical
Assistance to Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883 or, in Canada, % 519-
836-0102; www.iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns. The
United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (www.cdc.
gov) provides up-to-date information on health hazards by region or
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 87

country and offers tips on food safety. Travel Health Online (www.
tripprep.com), sponsored by a consortium of travel medicine practi-
tioners, may also offer helpful advice on traveling abroad.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
Communications in the Maritimes have come a long way since the dis-
tress signal from the Titanic was received at a remote cable station in
Canso, Nova Scotia. Today, the three provinces are connected to the out-
side world with the latest and greatest technology, making calling home
a breeze.
Using a cellphone in Canada
Just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t mean it works in
Canada. The three letters that define global wireless capabilities are
GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that makes
for easy cross-border cellphone use in and between around 100 coun-
tries worldwide, including Canada. In the U.S., T-Mobile, AT&T Wireless,
and Cingular use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Microcell (Fido)
and some Rogers customers are GSM, and all Europeans and most
Australians use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable
multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls throughout built-up areas of the
Maritimes. Just call your wireless operator and ask for “international
roaming” to be activated on your account. Unfortunately, per-minute
charges can be high — usually C$2 to C$3 in Canada.
Using an unlocked cellphone
Because of these high roaming charges, buying an “unlocked” world
phone from the get-go is important. Many cellphone operators sell
“locked” phones that restrict you from using any other removable com-
puter memory phone chip card (called a SIM card) other than the ones
they supply. Having an unlocked phone allows you to go to a retailer
within Canada and install a cheap, prepaid SIM card. (Show your phone
to the salesperson; not all phones work on all networks.) You get a local
phone number — and much, much lower calling rates. Getting an
already locked phone unlocked can be a complicated process, but it can
be done; just call your cellular operator and say you’re going abroad for
several months and want to use the phone with a local provider. Within
the United States, InTouch Global (% 800-872-7626; www.intouch
global.com) sells Canadian-specific SIM cards.
In Canada, Rogers (% 877-764-3772 or 416-935-5555; www.rogers.ca) 
is a wireless provider with outlets throughout the Maritimes, including
downtown Halifax at 6169 Quinpool Rd. (% 902-423-5653). This com-
pany sells SIM cards, cellphone accessories, and pay-as-you-go phones.

Renting a cellphone
For many, renting a phone that is set up to work in Canada is most con-
venient. While you can rent from within Canada (through car rental com-
panies is often easiest), I suggest renting the phone before you leave
home. That way you can give loved ones and business associates your
new number, make sure the phone works, and take the phone wherever
you go. In the United States, two recommended wireless rental compa-
nies are InTouch Global (% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com)
and RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-5665; www.roadpost.com).
Tell them you’re traveling to Canada, and they can tell you what wireless
products you need. InTouch also advises you — for free — on whether
your existing phone will work overseas; simply call % 703-222-7161
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST, or go to www.intouchglobal.com/
travel.htm.
Using a satellite phone
If you’re venturing deep into the Canadian wilderness, you may want to
consider renting a satellite phone (“satphones”), which are different
from cellphones in that they connect to satellites rather than ground-
based towers. A satphone is more costly than a cellphone but works
without cellular signals or towers. Unfortunately, you pay at least $3 per
minute to use the phone, and it only works where you can see the hori-
zon (that is, usually not indoors). In North America, you can rent Iridium
satellite phones from RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-5665; www.
roadpost.com) from US$100 per week. InTouch Global offers a wider
range of satphones but at higher rates. As of writing this, satphones are
very expensive to buy.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop, PDA (personal
digital assistant), or electronic organizer with a modem gives you the
most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you can still
access your e-mail and even your office computer.
Cybercafes
Nowadays, finding a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes is hard.
Although no definitive directory for cybercafes exists — these are inde-
pendent businesses, after all — two places to start looking are at www.
cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
With your own computer
More and more hotels, resorts, airports, cafes, and retailers are going
Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), becoming “hotspots” that offer free high-speed
Wi-Fi access or charge a small fee for usage. Most laptops sold today
have built-in wireless capability. To find public Wi-Fi hotspots within the
Maritimes, go to www.jiwire.com; its Hotspot Finder holds the world’s
largest directory of public wireless hotspots.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 89

For dial-up access, all business-class hotels in the Maritimes offer in-
room connections for laptop modems, and most have wireless Internet.
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit with the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Sizing Things Up: Converting to Canadian
Well, actually, I mean converting to metric. This section is only relevant
to readers from countries that have not adopted the global measure-
ment system — the United States, Liberia, and Myanmar.
Metric works on the decimal system, which means that all measure-
ments have a base of ten. The basic unit of measurement is a meter (a
little longer than one yard), which can be divided into 100 centimeters
(2.5 centimeters equals 1 inch) or 1,000 millimeters. One thousand
meters equals one kilometer (approximately 0.6 miles).
Learning the difference between kilometers and miles when driving is
probably the most important conversion you need to know. All speed
limits and distance signs in Canada are posted in kilometers. If the sign
dictates a limit of 100, that means 60 mph. Also, at the pump, gas is sold
in liters. Approximately 3.8 liters equals one U.S. gallon.
In 1975, rain began falling in Canada in millimeters and snow in centime-
ters. And, while older Canadians still talk in Fahrenheit, Celsius is the
official scale of measuring temperature, with water freezing at 0°C and
boiling at 100°C. To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, multiply by 1.8
and then add 32.
The only Canadian holdouts to metric conversion are golfers (golf
courses are measured in yards), seamen (boat speeds are measured in
knots and distances in nautical miles), and grocery stores (bulk retail
food like fresh vegetables is priced in ounces and pounds — but
weighed at the cash register in metric).

Nova Scotia

In this part . . . 
L
ife in Nova Scotia revolves around the ocean, and
chances are so will your travels in this fascinating
province. In this part, I unveil the best of Halifax with tips on
the top sights, the best places to stay, and dining experiences
you don’t want to miss. I also cover famous shipbuilding
towns such as Lunenburg and the spectacular Cabot Trail on
Cape Breton Island. Nova Scotia offers more than spectacular
scenery and quaint seaside towns, so I throw in a few bonus
tips, like where to see the world’s largest pumpkins and which
outdoor restaurant boils its lobster on barbeques — to make
sure you get the full effect!

H
alifax may look like any other city as you approach the runway, but
after you land, you’re obviously in the Maritimes. This port city
does a wonderful job of combining work and play. Although industrial
endeavors take up large chunks of shoreline, a prime stretch of water-
front is the epicenter for locals and visitors alike. Museums, boutiques,
restaurants, and pubs fill historic waterfront warehouses, with a seawall
promenade winding past tour boats, tall ships — and even the occa-
sional seal!
Although the harbor dominates the landscape, seeing past the working
port areas to uninhabited islands is easy, with glimpses of the Atlantic
Ocean in the distance. Overlooking the harbor is a compact downtown
core, with no point more than a few blocks from the water. Here, you
find all the trappings of a modern metropolis, delicately interspersed
with rows of 200-year-old stone buildings and abundant green space.
Downtown is first and foremost a business core, but the streets are per-
petually alive with friendly faces and the catchy sounds of traditional
East Coast music wafting out from darkened drinking holes.
Plan on spending two (preferably three) days in Halifax. Maritime
weather will have some bearing on what you do, so check the forecast
and plan your time at indoor attractions to coincide with rainy spells.
Getting There
Halifax is a transportation hub for all of the Maritimes. Most visitors
arrive by plane at Halifax International Airport or drive into the city on
one of four major highways.

By plane
Traveling from Halifax International Airport to the heart of downtown
takes around 40 minutes by road, but allow slightly longer during the
morning rush hour. Public transportation options are
 Bus. Because Metro Transit buses don’t reach the airport, try the
Airporter (% 902-873-2091), which offers service between the air-
port and major downtown hotels. The fare is C$16 one-way, C$28
round-trip. The first bus leaves the airport at 6 a.m., the last at mid-
night. Heading back to the airport, shuttles depart from most
accommodations up to 20 times daily between 5:30 a.m. and 10
p.m. (plan on catching a bus at least 90 minutes before your flight
departs). You don’t need advance reservations.
 Taxi. After collecting your baggage from the carousels, head
through the exit doors to the lineup of taxis out front. The set fare
to downtown is C$53.
Most of the major car rental companies have check-in counters near the
baggage carousels, and vehicles can be picked up in a parking lot within
easy walking distance. The exception is Discount, which operates out of
the nearby Airport Hotel; if your reservation is with this company, call
for a pickup at the hotel phone bank in front of the information booth.
The Web site www.flyhalifax.com is filled with helpful information,
including links to airlines serving Halifax and a real-time flight tracker.
Part III: Nova Scotia 
96
Historic Halifax
The sight of arriving immigrant ships and the echoes of horse-drawn carts down cob-
bled streets may be long gone, but the port city of Halifax retains its historical appeal.
Nowhere are the city’s nautical traditions better preserved than at the Maritime
Museum of the Atlantic, which is flanked by Canada’s oldest waterfront warehouses,
aptly named the Historic Properties.
But behind the museum and old buildings lies Halifax’s colorful history. Now home to
popular boutiques and restaurants, Halifax’s stone warehouses once stored pirate
booty. The British government commissioned private vessels to confront their ene-
mies (usually the French or the U.S.) and called it “privateering” — really just a pleas-
ant name for piracy.
The story of Halifax is punctuated by intriguing footnotes like this. The 1997 movie
Titanic brought renewed attention to the world’s best-known maritime disaster and its
numerous Halifax links, most of which are actively promoted as tourist attractions.
Other links are more subtle, such as the Five Fishermen restaurant, located in a former
funeral home where the Titanic’s first-class passengers were embalmed.

By car
Highway 102 cuts across Nova Scotia from New Brunswick, bringing you
right into the heart of Halifax. Allow three hours nonstop from the
border. You may discover plenty of worthwhile stops en route, but the
only one you must make is at the tollgates east of Amherst (C$3). As
Halifax looms on the horizon, Highway 118 branches left off Highway
102. This alternate route draws traffic into the city of Dartmouth, but
also provides a final approach to downtown.
Two highways lead into Halifax from the west: Highway 101 from along
the Bay of Fundy; and Highway 103, which runs along the South Shore
from Yarmouth. Both routes pick up ferry traffic from farther afield.
Ferries from Saint John (New Brunswick) terminate at Digby, a three-
hour drive along Highway 101 to Halifax. Travelers arriving by ferry at
Yarmouth from either Portland or Bar Harbor, both in Maine, face a four-
hour drive on Highway 103.
By train or bus
If you choose to travel into Halifax by train, VIA Rail runs into Nova
Scotia from Montreal, with the service terminating in Halifax at 1161
Hollis St. (% 888-842-7245; www.via.ca), on the southern edge of
downtown.
Acadian (% 902-454-9321; www.acadianbus.com) provides bus service
to Halifax from Moncton (New Brunswick), where connections can be
made from Montreal or Maine. These two cities are the closest that Grey-
hound services get to the Maritimes. You can purchase through tickets to
Halifax from Greyhound, and connections are seamless. Acadian also
runs buses to Halifax from points throughout the province, including the
ferry ports of Yarmouth and Digby. The Halifax bus depot is in the VIA
Rail station at 1161 Hollis St. and is open daily 6:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Orienting Yourself in Halifax
Most of Halifax’s attractions and major hotels are within walking dis-
tance of the touristy downtown waterfront precinct between Cogswell
Street in the north and South Street in, you guessed it, the south. The
main thoroughfare along this ten-block stretch is Water Street. This
narrow, winding road set back slightly from the harbor is dotted with
public parking lots (that’s a hint — downtown is compact enough that
you can see most sights on foot).
Halifax is small and easy to navigate. The city center clings to a hilly
peninsula within Halifax Harbour. From here, built-up areas spread in all
directions.
Chapter 11: Halifax 97

Downtown
Most attractions, accommodations, and restaurants are within walking
distance of each other in the downtown core. The basic grid pattern of
streets laid out over 200 years ago remains, bounded very roughly by
the harbor to the east and Citadel Hill to the west, with Cogswell Street
and Spring Garden Road creating man-made boundaries to the north and
south respectively. Water Street, as you may suspect, runs along the har-
borfront. South of Sackville Street, it’s known as Lower Water Street,
while to the north it’s Upper Water Street. Between Water Street and the
harbor are numerous pay parking lots, the Maritime Museum of the
Atlantic, restaurants, and gift shops.
Dartmouth
Two bridges and a ferry service link downtown Halifax with Dartmouth,
across the harbor to the east. Although Dartmouth has its own distinct
industrial, business, and residential districts, it is not a separate city, but
combines with Halifax to form the Halifax Regional Municipality. Less
picturesque than Halifax, it offers parks, lakes, and a few eccentric
attractions — head here if Quaker history, ocean research, or rocks from
around the world are your thing.
Bedford and Sackville
Bedford is a picturesque community at the head of Bedford Basin and
north of Halifax proper. Settled as early as 1749, its streets are lined with
well-kept middle- and upper-class homes, many with views back down
the harbor. If you detour into Bedford, be sure to find your way down to
the water’s edge, much of it protected by parkland.
You have little reason to visit Sackville, north of Bedford, but a quick
overview may be helpful for highway travelers entering Halifax from the
north along Highway 102. If you’re heading for the city, follow Highway
102 through Sackville. Don’t be tempted by “Halifax via the bridges” sig-
nage, which detours through Dartmouth and makes the approach to
downtown confusing.
Getting Around Halifax
Although downtown can get congested with traffic, this has more to do
with the narrow, hilly streets than any great volume of vehicles. The best
advice I can give you is to not plan on driving at all. Public transporta-
tion schedules and routes are designed to get residents to and from
work so, aside from the ferry to Dartmouth, you can leave this form of
transportation to the locals.
Driving (and parking)
If you’re staying downtown, park your car and walk. Your best bet is the
city-operated parking lots along Upper and Lower Water streets.
Part III: Nova Scotia 
98

With admission to Halifax Citadel, you can include parking for an addi-
tional C$3.20. Therefore, you can visit this top-of-the-town attraction
early in the day, and then leave your vehicle there while you spend the
rest of the day exploring downtown. Just remember, it’s an uphill walk
(or an inexpensive cab ride) at the end of the day, and keep your Citadel
entry receipt.
If Halifax International Airport is the starting point of your Maritimes
adventure, reserve your vehicle to be picked up at a downtown location
just before heading out of the city. Not only will you save a few days’
rental charge, but you won’t pay the airport car rental surcharge.
On foot
Downtown Halifax is a great place to get around on foot. You can easily
do without a vehicle and not miss any of the popular attractions. If
you’re staying downtown, then the main information center and all the
best restaurants are within easy reach. If you tire of walking, jump
aboard a tour bus or take to the water for a break. Only a few attractions
are out of reach by walking — save these up and visit them in one go.
Catching cabs
Cabs are easy to hail anywhere in the downtown area, especially along
Upper and Lower Water streets, or head for one of the major hotels
where taxis wait. Rates begin at C$3, increasing based on time and 
distance to around C$7 for a trip across downtown. Cab companies
include:
 Casino Taxi (% 902-425-6666)
 Co-op Taxi (% 902-444-0001)
 Maritime Taxi (% 902-456-4248)
 Yellow Cab (% 902-420-0000)
Transit tips
Metro Transit (% 902-490-6600) provides inexpensive bus and ferry
transportation to all parts of the city. The fare for any single sector is
C$2 adults, C$1.40 seniors and children, exact change only. The main
transit interchange is at the corner of Upper Water and George streets.
Call or pick up a schedule from the information center.
From July to October, every 40 minutes between 10 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
Metro Transit sponsors a free shuttle service known as Fred (short for
“free rides everywhere downtown”). Hop on and ride the loop through
Lower Water Street, Spring Garden Road, South Park Street, and South
Street for a free tour of the downtown core.
Chapter 11: Halifax 99

Staying in Halifax
The following recommendations are a cross section of accommodations
choices in various price categories. Prices fluctuate with supply and
demand. Most downtown hotels cater to business travelers, with rack
rates matching Monday-to-Friday work schedules. Weekend packages
are offered year-round, but look for the best deals outside of the summer
tourist season. As always, hotel Web sites are the best places to start
searching out deals.
Ask about additional charges for parking and local calls, since they may
not be included in your room’s rate.
To the rate quoted, count on 16 percent in taxes being added to your
final hotel bill.

Inn on the Lake
$$$–$$$$
Waverly
Set on 2 hectares (5 acres) of lakefront parkland north of Halifax, this coun-
try-style retreat is a world away from the bustle of city living (although I
have heard complaints about highway noise). You can sunbathe on a
white-sand beach, lounge on chairs surrounded by well-manicured gar-
dens, or crank up the energy level on the tennis courts and then cool off
in the large outdoor pool. Some of the standard rooms have poolside
patios, while others have lake-view balconies. Upgrade for C$25 to a
Deluxe Room and enjoy a king-size bed, jetted tub, a balcony, and Internet
access. Dining options include a poolside cafe, an English-style pub, or the
more formal Encore dining room. The inn is a ten-minute drive from the
airport, a short free shuttle ride away.

Dating to 1928, this landmark hotel has a reputation as one of Halifax’s
finest. Standard rooms are large and elegantly furnished; bathrooms are
particularly well equipped. Amenities include a business center, in-room
Internet access, free local calls, a concierge, and a British-style pub with
good, inexpensive food. Despite its size (260 rooms), service and attention
to detail is flawless. As is so often the case, disregard the rack rates and
book online to snatch deals such as a room, parking, breakfast, and a city
tour for two for around C$160. Make sure you request a room with views
of the adjacent Public Gardens.

Prince George Hotel
$$$$
Downtown
This place, halfway between the waterfront and Citadel Hill, is my fave
among downtown hotels. Even the standard guest rooms are spacious and
well appointed with lots of stylish mahogany furniture. For a few extra dol-
lars, you can opt for a Crown Service room, with upgrades like a CD player,
evening turndown service, and breakfast delivered to your door. Other in-
house amenities include the classy Gio restaurant (see “Dining in Halifax”
later in this chapter), a smallish indoor pool, wireless Internet, and a busi-
ness center. The personalized service is also a step above what you’d
expect from a hotel. Don’t be scared off by the rack rates — the hotel Web
site offers rooms for well under C$200 year-round, making them an excel-
lent downtown deal.

Prospect Bed & Breakfast

Prospect
If you have your own transportation, an overnight stay in seaside
Prospect, near Peggy’s Cove, is a delightful escape from city living. Housed
in a 150-year-old convent, four guest rooms each have a private bathroom
and the more expensive ones also have a fireplace. The ocean is nearly
always in sight, from your bedroom window, from the dining room, and
from the Adirondack chairs scattered around the grounds, or wander

Quality Inn Halifax Airport

Airport
As the name suggests, this hotel is right by the airport, 40km (25 miles)
north of downtown. A free shuttle transports guests between the two ter-
minals and the hotel 24 hours a day. The exterior and public areas are a
little tired, but spacious, comfortable rooms provide a relaxing stay before
or after a long flight. Aside from the adjacent aircraft museum, this prop-
erty is isolated — meaning you’re stuck eating at the in-house restaurant
(so-so food at best). On the plus side, facilities include indoor and outdoor
pools, a small fitness room, wireless Internet, and a lounge that opens to
a pleasant patio.

Dining in Halifax
The eateries along the downtown harborfront are the easiest to find and
have the best views. Considering their prime tourist locale, these restau-
rants are surprisingly popular with Haligonians, both during the week-
day lunch hour and for an evening meal, and the reasonable prices are a
pleasant treat. If you’re in the city for more than one night, I encourage
you to get adventurous and move away from the waterfront, where you
find pockets of restaurants along Argyle Street and Spring Garden Road.
Chapter 11: Halifax 103

Halifax has a good range of coffeehouses, but the chains you’re familiar
with (Starbucks, Second Cup, and others) are almost nonexistent.
Instead, head to Perk’s, at 1781 Lower Water St. (% 902-429-9386).
Located right beside the harbor, it offers all the usual coffee concoc-
tions, as well as light meals such as seafood salad croissants.
Bish

Downtown
GLOBAL
Aside from the unusual name, a few things make Bish stand apart from
Halifax’s other waterfront restaurants — it’s well away from the crush of
the Historic Properties, the setting is elegant, and the menu offers a lot
more than seafood. The cooking itself is excellent. The Madras curried
lamb shank stars as a main course; or have seafood if you must, with
choices such as seared scallops with red pepper and cilantro sauce. An
impressive wine list includes Canadian ice wines.

ITALIAN
Halifax’s finest Italian restaurant, da Maurizio, is in the historic Alexander
Keith’s Brewery building, across from the waterfront. Little has been done
to alter the structure, yet the dining room is pleasing to the eye, with clean,
simple lines set off by exposed red brick and lots of richly finished woods.
Begin with Melazane Alla San Daniele (grilled eggplant rolled in proscuitto),
and then get serious with upscale pasta presentations or main courses like
veal scaloppine (thin slices of veal sautéed in a lobster, sherry, and cream
sauce). Crème brûlée with fresh fruit is a fitting way to end this decadent
splurge. The wine list has many Italian choices, while sensibly also includ-
ing bottles from around the world.

CONTEMPORARY
First things first. The unusual name is derived from an old neon sign the
owners hung out front when they didn’t have the budget for proper sig-
nage. Since those simple times, the “Shoe” has become one of Halifax’s
most popular hangouts and expanded to include four dining rooms, each
with a different theme and ambience. One of these, Backstage, has a dis-
tinct bohemian vibe and a monastery-like setting of arched walls. Diamond
is another funky space, this one the domain of music fans who gather
around a juke box packed with an eclectic collection of tunes. The Belgian
Bar is so named for the European beers on tap, but with its high glass ceil-
ing and tropical setting, its also a great place to feel more cheerful than

tables spilling onto the sidewalk. Each room has a similar menu, with lots
of choices that are perfect for sharing.

Five Fishermen
$$–$$$
Downtown
SEAFOOD
Five Fishermen is one of Halifax’s better seafood restaurants, and the only
one housed in a building that once served as a funeral home for some of
the Titanic’s doomed passengers. Table settings are spread through a
number of different rooms (one re-creates a cruise ship’s dining room), all
with high ceilings and lots of brass and dark woodwork. You can’t go
wrong with any of the seafood or steak choices, but the baked medley of
seafood with saffron risotto is hard to top. Take a break from seafood with
any of the Alberta beef dishes, or enjoy the best of both worlds by order-
ing a half-lobster side. Don’t be put off by the price of main courses — they
include unlimited salad and steamed mussels.
Little Fish, in the same building (% 902-425-4025), is an inexpensive off-
shoot of the Five Fishermen, with most seafood mains under C$20. It’s
open weekdays for lunch, with locally themed choices like lobster crepes.

rified food court is anchored by Captain John’s (% 902-420-9255), where choices
range from a halibut burger (C$9) to a full lobster with all the trimmings (C$24). Looking
for something to share? Try the mussels, steamed in a tomato broth (C$8). Across the
way is Brisket Boardwalk Deli (% 902-423-7625) with healthy wraps, soups, and
sandwiches. The market even has its own brewpub, John Shippey’s (% 902-423-7386),

room for mains like lamb roasted in a maple and flax-seed crust then
smothered in blueberry mustard. At lunch, the Kobe beef burger, the city’s
most expensive burger at C$15, is a popular choice. Adding to the appeal,
service and presentation are as good as anywhere in Halifax.

simple and stick to classics like seafood linguini or bouillabaisse. Aside
from a few additional dinner entrees, the same menu is offered all day,
meaning you can order a burger for dinner or share a platter of Nova

This popular waterfront eatery is in the heart of the action at the front of

the watery world of Halifax Harbour go by. The menu is typical pub fare,
but with lots of local seafood. Considering the location, it’s great value,
with choices ranging from simple salads (under C$10) to entrees like baked
salmon casserole (C$16). This inexpensive menu is available for both
lunch and dinner. An upstairs dining room uses the same menu until 5
p.m., and then things get creative (and more expensive) with feature

dishes such as blackened halibut doused in a mango salsa and rack of

Exploring Halifax
In this section, I start out by discussing the major attractions of Halifax
and surrounding areas such as Dartmouth. If you like having someone
else doing the driving, the section on guided tours will be of special
interest, while I also include itineraries to make sure you miss nothing.
In addition to the interest of the attractions themselves, sightseeing in
Halifax has two things going for it — most downtown sights are within
walking distance of each other and entry fees are well-priced.

The top attractions
Alexander Keith’s Brewery
Downtown
When Alexander Keith arrived in Halifax from Scotland, he put his experi-
ence brewing beer for British troops in India to work, establishing a brew-
ery on the Halifax harborfront in 1820. Keith’s signature beer, India Pale
Ale, is still brewed at what is now North America’s oldest working brewery,
along with other English-style ales and seasonal brews. Led by costumed
guides, brewery tours are as much about the history of the city as they
are about the brewing process, making them popular with everyone. (And
the two free mugs of beer presented at the end of the tour have nothing to
do with it.)
Keith’s legacy is celebrated by the raising of mugs across city pubs, often
for no particular reason. Keith’s birthday, October 5, is celebrated more
officially at nearby Pier 22 with Nova Scotian music, marching bands, danc-
ing, and, you guessed it — lots of India Pale Ale.

The great explosion
On December 6, 1917, Halifax was scarred by the largest man-made explosion prior to
the Atomic Age. The Mount Blanc, a French munitions ship, collided with a Belgian
relief ship in the middle of Halifax Harbour. The accident itself wasn’t major, but it
started a fire aboard the Mont Blanc, and the crew, well aware of the cargo on board,
took to the water in lifeboats. As crowds gathered near the waterfront to watch the
spectacle, the ship exploded, leveling over 100 hectares (250 acres) at the northern
end of Halifax.
The force of the blast was almost incomprehensible: It was felt on Cape Breton Island
and heard as far away as Prince Edward Island. The initial explosion was followed by
fire, much of it fueled by coal stored in cellars for the approaching winter. The final
death toll was 2,000, with an additional 10,000 injured.
Fort Needham Memorial Park, a few blocks north of downtown along Gottingen Street,
is dedicated to the disaster. From the 14-bell carillon in the center of the park, you can
gaze down to the harbor and the exact spot where the explosion occurred.

Art Gallery of Nova Scotia
Downtown
Much of the art you see in Maritimes’ galleries depicts lighthouses and
fishing boats. This gallery proves that regional artists have a much
broader range of subject matter. The 5,000-strong permanent collection is
displayed in two buildings separated by a courtyard. A highlight is the col-
orful folk art decorated home of Maude Lewis. The gallery also hosts tour-
ing and temporary exhibits and is home to a small cafe serving up tasty
lunches.

C$12 adults, C$10 seniors, C$3 children. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (until 9 p.m. Thurs).
Tours depart daily at 2:30 p.m.
Fairview Cemetery
Fairview
You can read the names and moving tributes on some of the 121 head-
stones at the back of Fairview Cemetery, but most only have numbers. All,
however, have the same date — April 15, 1912. Halifax was the port where
many bodies from the Titanic were bought for identification. Victims were
identified by number, in the order they were pulled from the cold waters
of the North Atlantic. Graves of the unknown victims are marked with
these numbers.
For almost a century, these tombstones lay quietly at the back of the
Fairview Cemetery, seen only by the occasional visitor. Everything
changed with the release of the 1997 movie Titanic. Suddenly, the final rest-
ing place of victim number 227, Joseph Dawson, became very popular. He
coincidently shared a name with third-class seaman Jack Dawson (por-
trayed by Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie) and has, as a result, garnered
his own share of the actor’s fan base. The grave is impossible to miss —
just look for the fresh flowers left by weeping teenage girls.
Cemetery entrances are on Connaught and Chisholm avenues. Admission:
Free.
Government House
Downtown
Completed in 1805, this house has been the official residence of Nova
Scotia’s lieutenant governor longer than any other North American gov-
ernment residence. Built of Nova Scotian stone, it has been extensively
restored inside and out and although access is restricted, feel free to
admire the exterior from surrounding gardens.

Halifax Citadel National Historic Site
Downtown
I recommend starting your exploration of Halifax at the top, literally, by
visiting Citadel Hill, which sits atop a high point of land overlooking 
the harbor. The original fortifications, built in 1749, have been replaced
numerous times, with the most recent renovations completed in 1856 as a
deterrent to a perceived threat from the United States. The fort was
decommissioned in 1906, but has continued to serve as a proud symbol of
the Canadian military ever since. History comes alive at the Citadel in
summer through the haunting reverberations of bagpipers, a variety of
interpretive programs, and colorful kilted soldiers following shouted
marching orders. Indoor exhibits are tucked away in rooms built into the
walls. A good starting point is the Fortress Halifax display, which tells the
story of the complex. Other highlights are the schoolroom and the adja-
cent magazines, where gunpowder and cannon charges were stored. A trail
follows the top of the casement, encircling the courtyard and passing
cannon emplacements. Looking outward, views extend across downtown
to the harbor. In the middle of the courtyard, the two-story Cavalier
Building holds an information center, a cafe, and a gift shop.
The Old Town Clock, below the Citadel’s George Street entrance, is a city
landmark.
See map p. 95. Enter off Sackville Street, immediately west of Brunswick Street, 
and follow signs to public parking at the rear of the fortifications. On foot, walk up
George Street from the waterfront. % 902-426-5080. www.www.pc.gc.ca/

are open year-round, no services are available Nov to early May.
Maritime Museum of the Atlantic
Downtown
Just about everyone finds something of interest at this museum, one of
Halifax’s premier attractions. The exhibits in this restored waterfront ware-
house include numerous vessels that once plied the coastline, as well as
displays exploring Nova Scotia’s seafaring legacy through chronicles of
shipwrecks, the Canadian Navy, the Great Explosion, Sable Island, and the
fishing industry. Because of Halifax’s numerous links to the Titanic, a good
portion of the museum is dedicated to the tragedy. A highlight is Titanic
3D, a 15-minute documentary taken at the wreck site, shown at regular
intervals throughout the day.
Moored at the wharf in front of the museum is the 1913 hydrographic
steamer Acadia, which spent most of its life charting the ocean floor. Parts
of the ship are open for public inspection, including the deck area and the
chart room. At the next wharf is the HMCS Sackville, a speedy escort used
during WWII. Admission to both vessels is free with a museum ticket.

Halifax Harbour
On McNab’s Island is an 1888 fort built to defend Halifax Harbour from

outs with views back across to the city, sandy beaches, a lighthouse, and
an abandoned farm. Bring your own picnic lunch and drinks to one of the

Downtown
The province’s rich natural history is presented here, just west of Citadel
Hill. The skeleton of a pilot whale and dinosaur fossils take center stage in
the main gallery, with geology, anthropology, human history, and Acadian
culture displays filling out an interesting facility. Some exhibits change
with the season (it was the geology behind the Fundy tides when I last vis-
ited) while the critter-filled Nature Centre is where younger children grav-
itate.

Titanic tourism
A brochure detailing Titanic-related sights is available at the Maritime Museum and

along with Mount Olivet Cemetery, the final resting place of John Clarke, one of the
Titanic band members famous for continuing to play as the ship was sinking.

Pier 21
Downtown
Between 1928 and 1971, over one million immigrants first set foot in
Canada at Pier 21. The upstairs portion of this historic locale has since
been turned into a museum dedicated to these people and the trials and
tribulations they encountered on the journey to Canada. The Exhibition
Hall is filled with interactive displays that trace the immigration process.
Even if you’re not researching your roots, plan on spending a little time
here, especially at the compelling audiovisual presentations that relate
personal immigrant stories. The Research Department sounds more schol-
arly than it is. Computers and microfilm hold a database of ship arrivals
and some passenger lists (1925–1935).

Point Pleasant Park
Downtown
At the southern end of the downtown peninsula, 75 hectares (180 acres)
of prime waterfront is protected by this expansive park. The local ecosys-
tem changed forever in September 2003, when Hurricane Juan swept
through the park, destroying 75,000 trees, but it’s still an enjoyable place
to go walking or biking, or enjoy lunch at one of many picnic areas. You
can stroll along the 40km (25 miles) of trails that lace the park, or check
out the view from the centrally located Prince of Wales Martello Tower,
built in 1862 to defend the city from attack.
2km (1 mile) south along Marginal or Young avenues from downtown. Parking is plen-
tiful, or take Bus 9 from Scotia Centre. Open: Daylight hours. Admission: Free.
Province House
Downtown
Famously described by Charles Dickens in 1842 as “like looking at
Westminster through the wrong end of the telescope,” this small, sym-

1819. Inside the rather dour sandstone building are a number of inspiring

Public Gardens
Downtown
Generally regarded as North America’s finest original Victorian garden, this
7-hectare (17-acre) green space was created as a private garden in 1753,
just four years after the founding of Halifax. Carefully tended rose bushes
bloom in formal Victorian-style beds, rhododendrons grow so lush they
form a canopy over the path, and small streams link ponds inhabited by
ducks and swans. In the center of the gardens, an old-fashioned bandstand
hosts free Sunday afternoon concerts, but any sunny afternoon of the week
is a perfect opportunity to while away some time here. Across Sackville
Street from the north side of the gardens stands a sandstone cottage, the
home of gardener Richard Power, who designed the original layout.
See map p. 95. Bordered by Sackville Street, Summer Street, South Park Street, and
Spring Garden Road. The main entrance is at the corner of the latter two streets.

St. Paul’s Church
Downtown
Founded in 1749, St. Paul’s was the first cathedral built outside Great
Britain. Grand, white, and dotted with stained-glass windows, it’s now sur-
rounded by modern high-rises. Above the north-facing porch is a piece of

Crossing the harbor to Dartmouth
Dating to 1750 (just one year after Halifax was founded), the city of
Dartmouth lies across Halifax Harbour from downtown. The working
waterfront is dominated by industrial complexes with a population of
66,000 sprawling through to city limits. The city itself lacks the charm of
Halifax, but it has plenty of things to see and do.
Getting there and around
Driving to Dartmouth is possible, but arriving by ferry is a more enjoy-
able option. The ferry from downtown Halifax terminates at the Alderney
Landing quayside complex. A small visitor’s booth dispenses information
on local attractions and transit routes and schedules for buses headed to
the sights listed below. You can also find numerous shops, an indoor play
park, a library with free Internet access, an art gallery, and a Saturday
market (7 a.m.–1 p.m.).
Chapter 11: Halifax 113

From Alderney Landing, a short harborfront walking trail offers views
back across the water to Halifax and the impossible-to-miss Imperial Oil
refinery. In the adjacent Ferry Terminal Park is the World Peace Pavilion,
which includes stones of substance from over 60 countries, including
chunks of the Berlin Wall and the Great Wall of China.
Bedford Institute of Oceanography
Dartmouth
This government facility beside the MacKay Bridge is definitely worth
checking out. It’s Canada’s largest ocean research center, targeting a 
wide range of disciplines, from ocean surveillance techniques for the
Department of Defense to monitoring cod fisheries for the Department of
Fisheries and Oceans. The public is welcome to take a guided tour of the
facility that includes a glimpse of the latest 3-D underwater mapping tech-
nology. Within the institute, you can also visit the Sea Pavilion, home to a
series of touch tanks holding sea life collected from the Nova Scotia coast-
line, while another interesting display depicts the Titanic on the ocean floor.

Cole Harbour Heritage Farm Museum
Dartmouth
Children will love this little piece of country life, even though it’s sur-
rounded by suburbia. Geese, ducks, and rabbits roam freely around the
property while sheep and cows are fenced. The original farmhouse has
been converted to a tearoom and you can see “smithies” at work in the
blacksmith shop.

Downtown Museums
Dartmouth
Within walking distance of Alderney Landing, Quaker House, 57 Ochter-
loney St. at Edward Street (% 902-464-5823), is a good little museum open
Tuesday to Sunday mid-June through early September 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Quakers were drawn to Nova Scotia from New England for the whaling
industry and this 1786 home tells their story. Costumed guides lead visi-
tors out back to a herb and vegetable garden planted with the same vari-
eties that were planted there over 200 years ago. Admission is C$2. Keep
your receipt, because entry to nearby Evergreen House is included. It’s a
just few blocks away, at 26 Newcastle St. (% 902-464-2300); hours are the
same as at Quaker House. Displays catalog the human history of the
Dartmouth region, including a solid collection of antiques.

Fisherman’s Cove
South of Dartmouth
Jump aboard bus 60 at Alderney Gate to reach this photogenic fishing vil-
lage, 7km (41⁄3 miles) south of Dartmouth. Though many of the buildings
along the wharf have been renovated or are made to look weathered, an
authentic atmosphere prevails, with fishing boats bringing in daily catches
of lobster, crab, salmon, and halibut. At the Fisherman’s Cove Marine
Interpretive Centre, at the entrance to the wharf (% 902-465-6093), learn
about the history of the village and view local marine life in the aquari-
ums. Admission is C$1. The waterfront itself is the main attraction, but you
can find plenty of activities, including a sandy beach and kayak rentals.
Seeing Halifax by guided tour
If your time in Halifax is limited, joining a guided tour ensures that you
see all the major attractions. You can get an overview of the city in a
variety of ways — by land, sea, or a combination of the two. But even if
you only have one day in town, plan on spending at least some of it
exploring on foot. A trip out onto the harbor is also a must.
By bus
For a quick, complete tour of the city, Ambassatours (% 800-565-7173 or
902-423-6242; www.ambassatours.com) offers a three-hour Deluxe Historic
Halifax City Tour for C$39 adults, C$35 seniors, C$27 children. A kilted
guide provides a running commentary as a trolley car whizzes you around
the city. While this tour provides a good overview, you may not get to
linger as long as you’d like at some of the best stops — Citadel Hill alone
(one of the stops; admission included) easily deserves a two-hour visit.
Departures are June to mid-October daily at 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. from the
kiosk at Sackville Landing, Lower Water Street. Another option is a one-
hour downtown loop tour aboard an old British-style double-decker bus
with Double Decker Tours (% 902-420-1155; www.doubledeckertours.
com). You can get on and off as you please at any of 12 stops. Tickets are
C$43 adults, C$39 seniors, C$21 children, C$88 families. Buses depart every
30 minutes from 9 a.m. mid-June to October. The main ticketing office for
these tours is a kiosk at the corner of Duke and Lower Water streets.
By boat
One the most pleasurable ways to get a feel for Halifax is from sea level.
Jump on a commuter ferry, ride a tugboat with personality, or sail off
into the sunset aboard one of the world’s most famous yachts. However
you do it, get out on the water for a true feel of this seaside town!
The least expensive way to enjoy Halifax Harbour is from the upper deck
of the passenger ferry between Halifax and Dartmouth. Operated by
Metro Transit (% 902-490-4000), ferries depart for Dartmouth every 30
minutes between 6:30 a.m. and 9:30 p.m. from the terminal at the foot of
Duke Street. The 12-minute trip costs just C$2 adults, C$1.40 seniors and
children each way.
Chapter 11: Halifax 115

For a wide variety of tour boat options, head to Cable Wharf at 1751
Lower Water St. and the Murphy’s on the Water (% 902-420-1015;
www.murphysonthewater.com) ticket kiosk. The Harbour Queen I stern-
wheeler departs for a two-hour cruise daily at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., costing
C$22 adults, C$21 seniors, C$17 children; daily at 4:30 p.m. for a one-
hour cruise costing C$18 adults, C$17 seniors, C$15 children; daily at
6:30 p.m. for a two-hour dinner cruise costing C$45 adults, C$30 chil-
dren; and Friday and Saturday at 9:30 p.m. for a two-and-a-half-hour
party cruise complete with live music for C$18 per person. Murphy’s
also offers nature cruises, fishing trips, and boats to Peggy’s Cove.
If the Bluenose II is away from Halifax, or you miss one of the precious
few spots when this famous schooner is in town (see Chapter 12 for
more information), the Mar II is a good alternative. Operated by
Murphy’s, this wooden ketch that has circumnavigated the world now
departs Cable Wharf five to six times daily for a 90-minute sailing trip.
The cost is C$22 adults, C$21 seniors, C$17 children.
By amphibious craft
I’m sure that the engineers who developed the Larc V for transporting
supplies and troops in the Vietnam War never imagined one of their
boats would end up as a colorfully painted tourist attraction. But that
happened in Halifax with Harbour Hopper Tours, whose amphibious
vehicles can drive you around the streets of Halifax and then plunge into
the water for a harbor cruise. The ticket kiosk is on Cable Wharf (% 902-
490-8687, www.harbourhopper.com). May through October, the bus (or
is that boat?) departs up to 20 times daily between 9 a.m. and 9:30 p.m.
Rides are C$22 adults, C$21 seniors, C$17 children.
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
I show you some of the best ways to spend one, two, or three days in
Halifax, assuming you’re visiting in summer (along with almost everyone
else). For details on the attractions, restaurants, and activities men-
tioned in these itineraries, see the corresponding sections earlier in this
chapter.
One-day itinerary
If you have just a single day in Halifax, start at the top and hit Halifax
Citadel National Historic Site as soon as it opens (9 a.m.) to get a taste of
the city’s colorful past. Spend an hour exploring this fort, and then head
across to the Public Gardens (the Museum of Natural History is the
family alternative). Admire heritage buildings such as Province House on
the walk down to the harbor. At lunchtime, choose from the many stands
at Harbourside Marketplace (bypassing the seafood is hard — splurge
and share a lobster platter for two) and find a table outside. Afterward,
spend an hour or so at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic. Plan on
catching the 4:30 p.m. Mar II departure. After returning to the dock, take a
short walk to Salty’s, where your reservation ensures a waterfront table.
Part III: Nova Scotia 
116

Two-day itinerary
If you have two days in Halifax, you can follow the approach of the one-
day itinerary and then plan on rising early for a walk through Point
Pleasant Park on the morning of the second day. Kick off your official
sightseeing with a tour through Alexander Keith’s Brewery and then
wander along the waterfront to Pier 21. After lunch, move away from the
water and browse the shops of George Street and then stop by the Art
Gallery of Nova Scotia. Take a break from seafood at da Maurizio, then if
you’re still feeling active, head to the Lower Deck and catch one of the
regular bands entertaining the crowd with traditional Maritimes music.
Three-day itinerary
For the first two days, follow the two-day itinerary. If you happen to be
in Halifax on Saturday, squeeze in a visit to Halifax Farmers’ Market and
wander through stands of fresh produce and local arts and crafts. Plan
on spending most of your third day on the Dartmouth side of the harbor,
visiting the Bedford Institute of Oceanography, or keep the kids happy
by stopping by Cole Harbour Heritage Farm Museum. At Fisherman’s
Cove, travelers of all ages can enjoy soaking up the salty sights and
smells of a working village, but probably not as much as tucking into a
feast of seafood from one of the local eateries. Back in the city, enjoy
dinner at the Economy Shoe Shop, and then head over to Henry House
for a pint or two of the Granite Brewery’s Peculiar Ale. If you feel up to it,
catch a cab to Spring Garden Road and The Thirsty Duck to dance the
night away to traditional Celtic music.
Shopping
Shopping in Halifax tends to center around the waterfront, with a 
couple of notable exceptions. You can buy a wide variety of Maritimes
creations — everything from ceramic fishermen to one-of-a-kind art-
works. The city has a number of excellent art galleries, as well as 
quirky shops.
Checking out the scene
Shopping hours in Halifax are generally longer than elsewhere in the
Maritimes, but vary greatly depending on the clientele. The touristy
waterfront area is busy every day of the week, while many shops (and
some restaurants) in the business district follow business hours, closing
in the early evening and not opening at all on weekends.
Don’t forget that you must add the 13 percent Harmonized Sales Tax to
all quoted prices (actually, sellers add the tax at the cash register).
What to look for
Although Halifax is not renowned for any particular specialty items, these
Maritimes cultural products find their way into Halifax’s many shops:
Chapter 11: Halifax 117

 Seafood. The only sensible thing to do is with seafood is to eat it,
and which you’ll probably do most of time. Some seafood, such as
smoked salmon, is prepared to last, allowing you to take it home to
hungry relatives. At the airport, you can choose a lobster from the
tank and have it boxed specially for airplane travel.
 Books and music. Most bookstores have sections dedicated to
Atlantic Canada literature. Secondhand and antiquarian bookstores
often have large collections of nautical non-fiction. Traditional folk
music is also abundant in music stores as well as nearly all sou-
venir shops, which often have listening stations so you can get a
taste of the music before you buy.
 Tacky souvenirs. Whether you’re after a lighthouse Christmas dec-
oration, a city-branded T-shirt, or a fluffy moose, Halifax has plenty
of touristy shops to fulfill your needs. Start your search in the
Historic Properties along Upper Water Street.
Where to find it
This section details some of my favorite Halifax shopping experiences.
Antiques
Curiosities Antiques & Collectibles, at 1544 Granville St. (% 902-422-
4717), offers an eclectic mix of antiques from around the world.
At henhouse, south of downtown within the Hydrostone Market at 5533
Young St. (% 902-423-4499), antiques are mixed with beautiful hand-
built furniture constructed using traditional techniques. They also sell
hand-dyed cotton linens, ceramic kitchenware, and porcelain dog
dishes.
Arts and crafts
Jennifer’s of Nova Scotia, 5635 Spring Garden Rd. (% 902-425-3119), is
Nova Scotian all over. Pottery, fabric patchwork, jewelry, soaps, and just
about everything else is handcrafted. Many items are seasonal, focusing
on such occasions as Easter or Christmas.
The Historic Properties has a selection of crafty shops. One of these is
Aitkens Pewter, 1869 Upper Water St. (% 902-423-4563). Pewter prod-
ucts are crafted throughout the province, and sold at this outlet in
Halifax.
Camping and sporting gear
Halifax’s largest outdoor retailer is Mountain Equipment Co-op, 1550
Granville St. (% 902-421-2667). MEC, as it’s best known, is a co-opera-
tive owned by its members, similar to the American R.E.I. stores. Expect
a range of high-quality clothing and camping gear, canoes and kayaks,
field guides and maps, and a huge number of accessories.
Part III: Nova Scotia 
118

For over 40 years, The Trail Shop, 6210 Quinpool Rd. (% 902-423-8736),
has been outfitting locals and visitors planning to explore the surround-
ing wilderness. The selection of camping equipment, footwear, and field
guides is particularly strong.
Clothing
Island Beach Co. started out selling T-shirts from an old log church, but
has since grown into a 30-store chain with outlets across Atlantic
Canada. Head to their stores at 1903 Barrington St. (% 902-423-0908)
and 1781 Lower Water St. (% 902-422-4060) in downtown Halifax for
casual, contemporary clothing in a subtly themed nautical setting.
If you’re in the market for a kilt, or maybe a length of tartan to make
your own, Plaid Place in Barrington Place Shops at 1903 Barrington St.
(% 902-429-6872) is a good choice. They also stock other plaid clothing
such as ties, scarves, and sweaters. The range of children’s tartan prod-
ucts is especially impressive.
Crystal
You can’t miss NovaScotian Crystal, along the waterfront at 5080 George
St. (% 888-977-2797 or 902-492-0416), when crowds gather to watch arti-
sans turn molten crystal into delicate masterpieces using century-old
techniques. The factory doors open for public inspection daily between
8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., but the most intriguing part of the process — glass-
blowing — takes place Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The adjacent
shop sells a wide variety of unique pieces such as glasses, vases, and
paperweights.
Halifax Farmers’ Market
In 2008, North America’s oldest farmers’ market moved to a sparkling
new waterfront building on Pier 20 (off Terminal Road; % 902-492-4043).
Also known as Seaport Farmers’ Market, its hundreds of stands are filled
with local produce and crafty creations. Search out Nova Scotian maple
syrup, homemade meat pies, and specialty soaps. The market operates
every Saturday 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Nightlife
Mainly due to a healthy population of students, Halifax has a huge
number of pubs and nightclubs. Beer aficionados will love the selection
of local brews, most available on tap. Live music is a big part of the local
nightlife scene, with bands playing every night of the week somewhere
in town. Local bands to watch for include the Kilkenny Krew, the
Navigators, McGinty, and Sloan.
Most pubs open at 11 a.m. and close at midnight through the week and
at 1 a.m. on weekends. Nightclubs generally stay open later, closing
between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m.
Chapter 11: Halifax 119

For complete listings of everything that’s happening after dark, pick up
the free Coast newspaper (www.thecoast.ca) for a full schedule of
music, stage, and film performances as well as club listings. Another
source of information is the waterfront visitor center, where a map is
dedicated to city drinking holes.
Pubbing and clubbing it
There’s no better place to start this exploration of the local bar scene
than down at the harborfront. The Lower Deck, in the Privateer’s
Warehouse at 1869 Upper Water St. (% 902-425-1501), is part of a three-
story restaurant complex, with a few tables spread out on the adjacent
wharf. It’s the quintessential Halifax pub — good tunes, lots of local beer
on tap, and smart, friendly service. Bands belt out traditional East Coast
music nightly from 9:30 p.m., with afternoon patio parties scheduled on
summer Saturday afternoons from 3 p.m. It’s popular with locals, so
arrive early to get the best seats. John Shippey’s Brewing Company
(% 902-423-7386) is tucked into a corner of the Harbourside Market at
1869 Upper Water St. Beer is brewed on-site, with large brew tanks filling
a glass-walled loft. As part of the food court, the beer is served at tables
spread inside and outside along the dock. A few are set aside for brew-
ery patrons, with table service available. I recommend the Piper’s Pale
Ale, a light and refreshing beer that is the perfect accompaniment to a
seafood meal. Continuing along the harborfront, Stayner’s Wharf, 5075
George St. (% 902-492-1800), is as popular for its food as it is for its
beer. Monday and Tuesday nights are dedicated to improv comedy, and
Thursday to jazz, while Maritimes music draws weekend crowds.
Continuing south along the harbor is the Stag’s Head, within Keith’s
Brewery on Lower Water Street (% 902-455-1474). Come here to relax
with a pint of India Pale Ale and listen to traditional Maritimes music.
The Granite Brewery, two blocks from the water at 1662 Barrington St.
(% 902-422-4954), pours beer from its in-house brewery in a relaxed,
upmarket atmosphere. Upstairs is Ginger’s Tavern, which is the reincar-
nation of a pub of the same name that was popular in Halifax during the
1980s. On any given night, it can be the same 1980s crowd, too, listening
to the same music. Just down the road, Granite Brewery’s original loca-
tion is now Henry House, 1222 Barrington St. (% 902-423-5660), with a
pub downstairs and a restaurant upstairs. It is as authentic as any of the
British-style pubs in town, with an exposed brick and beam interior,
cozy nooks, private booths, muted lighting, comfortable seating, and of
course the Granite’s popular Peculiar Ale on tap.
The Thirsty Duck, 5472 Spring Garden Rd. (% 902-492-3825) is best
noted for its sunken rooftop patio, a pleasant escape from the noisy
street below. The decibel level does go up on weekends, when crowds
gather and bands strum their stuff inside. (“The Duck,” as it’s usually
known, gets its name from a pond in the nearby Public Gardens where
ducks gather for a refreshing drink.) Two blocks west, Your Father’s
Moustache, 5686 Spring Garden Rd. (% 902-423-6766), is a big, bright
pub, with a rooftop patio complete with its own bar and a summer-only
Part III: Nova Scotia 
120

menu of fresh lobster. Admiring the ocean-themed mural behind the
main stage is a good excuse to visit.
Other bars and nightclubs
Dome, 1746 Grafton St. (% 902-422-6907), is Halifax’s largest dance
club. It also features a separate bar area and a room dedicated to live
music on weekends; closed Monday and Tuesday. The Palace, at 1721
Brunswick St. (% 902-429-5959), is another city-style nightclub popular
with the 20-something crowd. Bitter End, 1570 Argyle St. (% 902-425-
3039), is a hip hangout that tries for a European air of elegance. The
drink selection is impressive (good martinis and Caesars), cool contem-
porary art hangs on the walls, and candles create a distinctive atmos-
phere that sets this pub apart from those I mention earlier. Niche, 1505
Barrington St. (% 902-423-6632), is another stylish place, this one with
a good wine list and an outdoor patio. Jazz is a summer music staple.
Reflections, at 5184 Sackville St. (% 902-422-2957), has a reputation as
Halifax’s premier venue for gays and lesbians, but is also popular with
the adventurous mainstream crowd. Through the working week, expect
game and theme nights as well as karaoke, while on weekends a DJ spins
the latest dance hits.
The arts
Halifax more than makes up for its lack of major theater companies with
semi-professional theater groups and a packed schedule of summer arts
festivals.
Chapter 11: Halifax 121
Local brews
Finding an authentic pint in Halifax is easy, and I really encourage you to forego the
big brewery products familiar to most of us (through advertising as much as anything
else) and try local brews.
Best-known is Alexander Keith’s India Pale Ale, brewed in Halifax since 1820 (see
“Exploring Halifax,” earlier in this chapter, for brewery tour information) and available
on tap throughout the city and at liquor stores across Canada. This beer has a dis-
tinctive “hoppy” flavor, a hangover (pun intended) from the original recipe. The style
of beer was developed in Britain, with extra hops added to preserve the beer during
its long journey to troops stationed in India (hence the name).
Propeller and Garrison are known as microbreweries. Their output is a fraction of
Keith’s; look for these beers on tap at many pubs and in local liquor stores.
Ingredients are sourced from as far away as England for Granite Brewery’s Peculiar
Ale. This darker ale has a smooth, malty-sweet taste and is usually served only slightly
below room temperature.

Theater
The Neptune Theatre calls a historic theater at 1593 Argyle St. (% 902-
429-7070) home. The main season runs mid-September to May with a
smattering of performances ranging from classic to contemporary
throughout the summer. Tickets range from C$15 to C$50.
For lighter theater fare (historically themed musical comedy anyone?)
that comes with a substantial three-course meal, make reservations 
for the Grafton Street Dinner Theatre, at 1741 Grafton St. (% 902-425-
1961). Tickets are adults C$36, children under 13 C$17; plan to be seated
by 6:45 p.m.

T
he southwestern portion of Nova Scotia has a raw magnetism unlike
anywhere else in Canada. Envisage an endless line of picturesque
seaside villages clinging to the rocky shorelines of sheltered bays. The
region is mostly rugged and often remote, yet it holds some of Canada’s
oldest towns. Unhurried and unchanged for decades, they’re living proof
of Nova Scotia’s nautical traditions.
Glance at a map of Nova Scotia to see that a single highway encircles the
southwestern part of the province, rarely more than a few kilometers
from the ocean. Drive along this route, beginning and ending in Halifax,
to get more than a taste of Maritimes history and charm. In this section,
I explore some of the notable towns you encounter on the way.
The farther you travel from Halifax, the less touristy it becomes. This is
a good thing when it comes to crowds, but always plan ahead by making
accommodations reservations in advance and carrying a small amount
of cash — just in case that craft shop with the wooden whale doesn’t
accept credit cards.
Peggy’s Cove
Less than an hour’s drive southwest of Halifax is Peggy’s Cove, a village
of just 60 people, renowned for its postcard-perfect composition. On the
way there you encounter several towns — including Prospect, East
Dover, and West Dover — that are worth a look.

Getting there
Finding your way out of Halifax and onto Highway 103 along the South
Shore is simply a matter of map-reading — follow Cogswell Street to
Quinpool Road then merge across to Highway 3 (Margaret’s Bay Road) 
at the large traffic circle. After 3km (2 miles), Highway 333 to the left is
signposted to Peggy’s Cove. Take this route, and you quickly leave the
city behind; miss the turn, and you end up on Highway 103, which zips
down the coast on an inland route that misses some of Nova Scotia’s
best scenery.
Between Halifax and Peggy’s Cove, Highway 333 passes a turnoff to East
Dover before reaching West Dover. Both are quintessential fishing vil-
lages, comprising smartly kept homes separated from the ocean by a
rocky shoreline. Even if you don’t stop to wander the wharves, at least
slow down and soak up the atmosphere.
Exploring Peggy’s Cove
Ocean views from the approach to Peggy’s Cove are impressive. But
don’t be tempted to drive to the end of the road. Instead, leave your
vehicle in the parking lot to the left as you enter the village. From this
point, the road narrows and descends to the harbor, with its boats, nets,
and lobster traps. At the end of the road are a restaurant that tries hard
not be touristy and an octagonal lighthouse, surrounded by rounded
granite boulders, that is the center of attention for most visitors. It’s also
the only lighthouse in North America to have a post office.
Beyond the turnoff into Peggy’s Cove is the touching Swissair Memorial,
dedicated to the 229 passengers and crew who lost their lives when
Swissair Flight 111 crashed into the ocean, within sight of land, off
Peggy’s Cove on the night of September 2, 1998.

Taking a tour to Peggy’s Cove
If you don’t have your own vehicle (or even if you do), consider taking a tour to Peggy’s
Cove. Ambassatours (% 902-425-9999; www.ambassatours.com) offers trans-
portation that includes a running commentary for C$42 adults, C$38 seniors, C$30 chil-
dren. The tour is flexible, with the option to return at your own leisure on buses scheduled
to leave Peggy’s Cove for Halifax every 90 minutes. An alternative to the bus is the
Peggy’s Cove Express (% 902-422-4200; www.peggyscoveexpress.com), with the
captain searching out whales, dolphins, and puffins on the two-and-a-half-hour journey
down the coast from Cable Wharf in downtown Halifax. This tour departs every Friday
and Sunday at 9 a.m. between mid-June and mid-October and costs C$70 for adults,
C$63 for seniors, and C$50 for children.

Because the village is popular with tour buses, it can get extremely busy
after 9 a.m., especially when the cruise-ship crowd is docked in Halifax.
Plan on an early morning excursion to miss the worst of the crowds 
and also to have the best light for photographing the “world’s most pho-
tographed lighthouse.” Of course, if you’d rather join the tourists than
fight them, see the sidebar “Taking a Tour to Peggy’s Cove.”
Mahone Bay
Picturesque Mahone Bay is a small village with a big-time reputation for
its charmingly restored private homes and businesses set around a
narrow inlet filled with boats. The narrow main street wends its way
around the water, passing art galleries, craft shops, cafes, and restau-
rants housed in historic buildings, many dating from the days when
Mahone Bay was a major shipbuilding center. At the head of the inlet,
the towering spires of three adjacent churches make for one of Canada’s
most photographed scenes.
Getting there
Follow Highway 103 southwest from Halifax for 80km (50 miles) and take
Exit 10 to reach Mahone Bay. Parking is permitted along the streets, but
a better option is the parking lot opposite the churches just before
downtown.
Staying in Mahone Bay
While day-trippers from Halifax fill the streets of Mahone Bay, only those
smart enough to have made advance reservations are able to take
advantage of the limited number of guest rooms in the village.
Amber Rose Inn

Mahone Bay
Along the main street, Amber Rose Inn offers three old-fashioned, antiques-
filled guest rooms in a historic building that has been used by various com-
mercial enterprises (one section now has an antiques shop). All rooms
have robes, coffeemakers, and dataports. The inn has a front veranda that
is good for people-watching and extensive gardens, complete with outdoor
furniture and a swing, which are perfect for escaping from the main street
crowds. Rates include a full breakfast.

Exploring Mahone Bay
You can walk easily from one end of Mahone Bay to the other in ten min-
utes, but that’s not the point. Instead, plan on spending at least two
hours admiring the fine architecture and making the following stops
(listed from the parking lot in front of the churches):
 Jo-Ann’s Deli: Located at 9 Edgewater St. (% 902-624-6305; May–
Oct daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.), this is the place to pick up picnic supplies
like baked goodies and healthy wraps, as well as jams and pre-
serves. Of special note are the blueberry scones (delicious!) and
the bag of carrots (not for general consumption) used as a counter-
weight for the front door.
 Tea Brewery: At 525 Main St. opposite the end of Clairmont Street,
the Tea Brewery (% 902-624-0566; weekdays 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.,
Sat 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Sun noon to 5:30 p.m.) is crammed with teas
and tea-brewing paraphernalia from around the world. Two tables
and a selection of cakes may tempt you to linger longer.
 Bandstand: Behind the grocery store parking lot is a flower-encir-
cled waterfront bandstand. From this vantage point, you can take
the classic Mahone Bay photo of the three churches reflected on
the water.
 Mahone Bay Trading Company: Opposite the bandstand on Main
Street (% 902-624-8425). Walk past the potting soil and laundry
detergent in this general store to admire the massive boat-shaped
counter. It’s open Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday 11
a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Amos Pewter: View the ancient art of casting, spinning, and finish-
ing pewter at this waterfront workshop at 589 Main St. (% 902-
624-9547; June–Aug Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.,
closed Sun the rest of the year).

Charming Chester
In the late 1700s, Chester, north of Mahone Bay along Highway 3, was an infamous
hub of pirates, privateers, and smugglers. The village matured over time into a resort
town dominated by imposing waterfront mansions and sprawling summer estates.
Today, Chester still has a distinctive moneyed feel. Local real estate is among the high-
est priced east of Montreal; well-heeled guests stay at upscale lodges such as Haddon
Hall Resort Inn (% 902-275-3577; www.haddonhallinn.com), and yachters from
around the world tie up at the local marina. Through it all, the community itself remains
very approachable — children splash around in a tidal swimming pool beside million-
dollar boats, locals mix with visitors in downtown’s brightly colored Kiwi Café
(% 902-275-1492; daily 8:30 a.m.–4 p.m.), and a mid-August yachting regatta attracts
as many spectators as boat owners.

 Mahone Bay Settler’s Museum: Admission is free to this small
museum in a 150-year-old home across from Amos Pewter. Displays
trace the history of the local shipbuilding industry and highlight
local architecture. It’s at 578 Main St. (% 902-624-6263). Open:
June to early September Tuesday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
Sunday 1 to 5 p.m. Admission is free.
 Redden’s Fine Whale Sculptures: Stop by the studio of Susan
Redden, at 788 Main St. (% 902-624-1232; June–Sept), to admire
her mahogany carvings, which reflect the enchanting personality 
of whales and dolphins through clean, polished lines.
Lunenburg
A stay in Lunenburg (population 2,400), famous for its colorful, perfectly
preserved private homes and commercial buildings overlooking a
bustling harbor, is a Maritimes highlight.
Lunenburg successfully juggles an active working harbor with a prosper-
ous tourism industry — and does it well. The town brims with excellent
accommodations, lively restaurants, and artsy shops.
Getting there
Lunenburg is 92km (57 miles) southwest of Halifax. To drive from the
capital, take Highway 103 to Exit 10 (if you want to visit Mahone Bay) 
or Exit 11. From either of these exits, take a ten-minute drive along well-
signposted rural roads to Lunenburg.
Orienting yourself in Lunenburg
Commercial enterprises are concentrated on four parallel streets:
Bluenose Drive (along the waterfront), Pelham Street, Lincoln Street, and
Montague Street. Pelham and Montague streets are of most interest to
visitors, with restaurants, boutiques, and craft shops.
The location of the Lunenburg Visitor Information Centre (take Pelham
Street east through town) on Blockhouse Hill Road (% 902-634-8100)
affords good views, but is a little inconvenient for arriving visitors. It’s
open May through October 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. The Web site www.explore
lunenburg.ca has lots of information on the town’s history and links to
tourist services.
Staying in Lunenburg
A couple of factors make staying in Lunenburg more expensive than else-
where in the province — most lodgings are in grand old homes (no chain
motels here) and demand is high for a limited number of rooms.
Reservations are a must in July and August, but also recommended for
June and September.

selves are simply furnished with antique-style beds and hardwood floors,

things to do in town, find plenty to see and do out on the water or at any
of the nearby attractions — this section’s got it all covered.
Fisheries Museum of the Atlantic
Downtown
If wandering along the waterfront doesn’t give you a good enough feeling
for the region’s heritage, this harborside museum in a former fish-pro-
cessing plant will. As the name suggests, it highlights the fishing industry,
using exhibits of boat-building (including a shop where you can watch car-
penters at work), whales and whaling, commercial fishing equipment, and
rum-running during the era of prohibition. In the Millennium Aquarium,
commercially important fish species, super-sized lobsters, and a variety
of crabs reside in large tanks, and a touch tank allows you to get up close
and personal with tidal pool species such as starfish. And the museum
takes advantage of its harborfront location — a small fleet of historic ves-
sels is tied up out front, including the Teresa E. Connor, a wooden schooner
that spent her life on the famous Grand Banks fishery. You can also take
your pick from a busy schedule of daily events such as knot-tying and sea-
faring storytelling out on the dock.

Historic buildings of note
Some buildings in the oldest part of town (known as Old Town) date to
the 18th century, but most are pre-1900. Aside from the colorful palette
of paint, restoration work is unpretentious (no fancy woodwork or fake
facades). What you see is what you would have seen a century ago,
which creates a real visual sense of history. Although most of the
restoration has been done by individual owners, the town as a whole
achieved the ultimate accolade in 1995 — when the Old Town was
declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for being “the best example
of a British colonial settlement in North America.”
While it was Old Town as a whole that was recognized by UNESCO as a
World Heritage Site, the following individual buildings are especially
noteworthy:
 Scotia Trawler Shipyard. The Bluenose was built at this sprawling
complex at 250 Montague St. (% 902-634-4914). Today, it also
incorporates boat construction and repair with the Yacht Shop, pri-
marily serving the needs of local seamen but with a range of
marine-themed souvenirs unlike anything in the more touristy
shops. The actual shipyards are off-limits, but access to the adja-
cent Government Wharf is permitted.
 Knaut Rhuland House. Aside from commercial enterprises, this
historic home at 125 Pelham St. (% 902-634-3498) is the only his-
toric building in Old Town Lunenburg open to the public.
Considered to be the finest example of Georgian architecture any-
where in the Maritimes, it’s open mid-June through mid-October,
Monday to Saturday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission costs C$1.
 Bailly House. Built in 1780, this privately owned home at 134
Pelham St. is the oldest building in Lunenburg. It’s owned by the
brother of artist Earl Bailly, whose work is displayed in civic build-
ings (including the library and museum) throughout town.
 St John’s Anglican Church. Tragically destroyed by fire in
November 2001, this 1753 Lunenburg landmark on the corner of
Duke and Cumberland streets has been carefully rebuilt in its
Gothic Revival grandeur.
 Lunenburg Academy. This striking building at 97 Kaulbach St. is a
rare example of a large wooden school. Dating to 1895, it still oper-
ates as a center for education. The black-and-white turreted struc-
ture is easy to recognize from anywhere around the harbor.
Other cool things to do in and around Lunenburg
In addition to browsing nautically themed shops and walking the fair-
ways of Bluenose Golf Club (% 902-634-4260), here are a few other
activities to keep you busy in and around Lunenburg.

Boat tours
The following tours depart May through October, although outside July
and August they do run on a limited schedule.
If the Bluenose II is out of port, or you missed a spot, don’t despair, you
have another option. The Eastern Star, a classic 15m (48-foot) wooden
ketch, departs Lunenburg up to four times daily for a sailing trip around
the harbor (the 7 p.m. Sunset Cruise is two hours and travels to Ovens
Natural Park). Buy tickets from the dockside booth at the foot of King
Street (% 902-634-3535). The cost is C$24 to C$27 adults, C$11 to C$14
children.
Exactly as the name suggests, Lobstermen Tours (% 866-708-3434 or
902-634-3434), are trips in a working fishing boat. Led by local fishermen,
you get to learn firsthand about lobsters and the industry from the
Chapter 12: Southwestern Nova Scotia 133
The Bluenose
The dime is the only Canadian coin that doesn’t feature one of the country’s flora or
fauna. It depicts the Bluenose, a famous sailing ship that represents East Coast nau-
tical traditions and is about as Canadian as the maple leaf. Built as a fishing schooner,
the Bluenose was actually designed for winning the International Fishermen’s Trophy,
an America’s Cup–style racing series between working ships from Canada and the
U.S. After its launch from Lunenburg in 1921, the Bluenose enjoyed a tremendously
successful career, retiring from racing after 17 undefeated years, and was then inglo-
riously lost on a reef off Haiti in 1946.
Back in Lunenburg, construction of the Bluenose II began in the 1960s, using the orig-
inal plans to create an exact replica of her predecessor, right down to the sails and rig-
ging. The Bluenose II now spends June through September mixing public cruises with
appearances at festivals and events around the Nova Scotian coast. The public cruise
portion of her schedule is divided between Lunenburg and Halifax. Half of all tickets
are allotted for advance sales (% 866-579-4909 or 902-634-4794), with the remainder
sold dockside 90 minutes prior to sailing. For tickets in Lunenburg, go to the fisheries
museum; in Halifax, look for the booth on the waterfront beside the Maritime Museum 
of the Atlantic. The cost is C$35 for everyone aged 13 and over, C$20 children 3 to 13. 
The Bluenose II sailing schedule is posted on the Web site, www.museum.gov.
ns.ca/bluenose. To ensure a spot, either make advance reservations at least three
months prior to sailing or be in line for the standby tickets at least two hours before the
posted departure time. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.
Wondering where the boat’s unusual name originated? So do the experts, but I like
one theory in particular — local fishermen would wipe their noses when wearing blue
mittens, and in the cold, wet conditions onboard, the dye would often run.

experts before pulling traps (hopefully) filled with lobsters. The two-
hour tour departs four times daily from the foot of King Street, and the
cost is C$32 adults, C$12 children.
If you’re not planning on traveling as far as Digby or Cape Breton Island,
then Lunenburg is the next best option for a whale-watching trip.
Lunenburg Whale Watching Tours (% 902-527-7175) has an excellent
record for spotting humpback, finback, minke, and pilot whales. Regular
sightings of sunfish, turtles, porpoises, dolphins, seals, and puffins
round out what can be a very exciting tour. The cost is C$45 adults, C$30
children.
Blue Rocks
In this picturesque hamlet is a jumble of fishing cottages clinging to a
rocky shoreline, with small fishing boats in a protected bay, and the
shoreline dotted with fishing nets and lobster traps. In other words, this
is exactly what Nova Scotia is supposed to look like — minus the crowds
of Peggy’s Cove. Take Pelham Street eastbound through Lunenburg and
follow Blue Rocks Road.
Ovens Natural Park
The “ovens” are sea caves that have been carved into cliffs over thou-
sands of years by the ocean’s waves. A trail leads to various overlooks,
while another ends at the mouth of one of the larger caves. Also at the
site are a small gold rush museum and a restaurant. To get to this com-
mercialized natural attraction, take Route 332 south from Lunenburg for
16km (10 miles) (% 902-766-4621; www.ovenspark.com). Admission is
C$8 adults, C$4 seniors and children. View the caves from sea level on a
boat tour for C$27 adults, C$20 children. Open: Mid-May to early
October daily 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Shelburne
The small South Shore town of Shelburne is as attractive and interesting
as its better-known counterparts to the north, but because it’s that
much farther from Halifax, it remains untouristy.
Founded in 1783, by 1900 Shelburne had grown into one of the most
important shipbuilding centers in North America. Local boat builders
were renowned for quality wooden boats, with some of the world’s first
and fastest yachts coming from local shipyards (some consider
Shelburne the birthplace of the yacht). The waterfront remains remark-
ably unchanged from its halcyon years.
Getting there
Take Exit 26 from Highway 103 to access downtown Shelburne. This
turnoff is 133km (83 miles) southwest of Lunenburg and 123km (76

Exploring Shelburne
Head down to Dock Street, which runs along the waterfront, and you’re in
the middle of Shelburne Historic District, which is the largest concentra-
tion of wooden buildings from the late 1700s remaining in Canada. Many
are private residences, while others are still home to a variety of boat-
building endeavors. Four buildings are open to the public. Admission to
each is C$3, or buy a combined pass for C$8. They are as follows:
 Shelburne County Museum, 8 Maiden Lane (% 902-875-3219; June
to mid-Oct daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m., mid-Oct to May Mon–Fri 2–5
p.m.), is the best place to learn about the earliest Loyalist settlers
and the subsequent years of shipbuilding fame.
 John C. Williams Dory Shop Museum, 11 Dock St. (% 902-875-
3219; June to mid-Oct daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.), has been churning
out dory boats since the 1880s, when they were first used on the
Grand Banks to help lay fishing nets from a mother ship.
 Muir-Cox Shipyard, south end of Dock Street (% 902-875-5310;
June–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.), has been in continuous opera-
tion since 1820. Inside, the Shipbuilding Interpretive Centre
describes the history of the industry while the Boatshop, which
once turned out enormous full-rigged barques, now takes orders for
smaller wooden boats (viewing year-round Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–4 p.m.).
 Ross-Thomson House, 9 Charlotte Lane (% 902-875-3141; June to
mid-Oct daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.), a general store built by Loyalist
brothers in 1784. The interior re-creates the time (complete with
staff in period costume behind the counter) when locals flocked in
to purchase goods such as salted cod and tobacco.
La Côte Acadienne
The French place names, the soaring church spires, and the numerous
Acadian flags (red, white, and blue strips with a yellow star) tell you that
this is Nova Scotia’s largest Francophone enclave. La Côte Acadienne
(Acadian Coast) is home to descendants of Acadians who resettled here
after returning from their 1755 expulsion, which you can find out all
about up the road at Grand Pré National Historic Site (see later in this
chapter).
Getting there
La Côte Acadienne stretches for 50km (31 miles) along the Bay of Fundy
between Yarmouth and Digby. Highway 101 zooms through the region,
but take coastal Highway 1 to hit the highlights that I detail in the
upcoming sections.

Staying along La Côte Acadienne
La Côte Acadienne is decidedly untouristy, but scattered through the
small towns are a number of roadside motels like the Bluefin Motel,
along Highway 1 in Meteghan (% 902-645-2251), which falls into the $$
price range and has a restaurant.
Cape View Motel & Cottages
$$
Mavillette
What would normally be a rather nondescript complex of ten motel rooms
and five self-contained cottages is enlivened by sweeping water views and
an adjacent provincial park that protects a sandy beach. Across the road
is an affiliated restaurant where the menu includes locally inspired dishes
such as a lobster omelet.

rants in the motels, but for a fully Acadian dining experience, nowhere
beats Rapure Acadienne.

ACADIAN
More of a bakery than a restaurant, this roadside outlet specializes in
rappie pie, a simple and hearty Acadian dish. The filling — shredded
potato, chunks of chicken, and bacon — is delicious, but it has an unusual
texture that may take some getting used to. The pies here are massive
(plan on sharing one between two people) and come with a side of
molasses. Order at the inside window and plan on eating at one of the out-
door picnic tables off to the side.

Exploring La Côte Acadienne
The drive along Highway 1 is scenic, and also takes in each of the attrac-
tions that I describe in this list, which are detailed from south to north.
 Mavillette Beach Provincial Park. La Côte Acadienne’s nicest
stretch of sand is within this small park on the south side of
Mavillette. The sun warms the shallow water on summer days, but
swimming isn’t compulsory — you can also comb the beach for
seashells and follow a boardwalk that leads across a salt marsh.
 Smuggler’s Cove Provincial Park. The name is a giveaway. From a
cliff-top parking lot, a path leads down through a wind-blown
Chapter 12: Southwestern Nova Scotia 137

coastal forest to a cove where, the story goes, rumrunners stored
their goods during the Prohibition era.
 La Vielle Maison. This homestead in Meteghan has been restored
and converted to a museum. It allows a glimpse inside an Acadian
home, with furnishings dating back 200 years and interpreters in
traditional dress. It’s along Highway 1 (% 902-645-2389). Open:
July to August daily 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and admission is by donation.
 Église de Sainte-Marie. This, the tallest wooden church in North
America, towers above all else in the aptly named village of Church
Point. Completed in 1905, the church is laid out in the shape of a
cross, with the steeple rising 56m (175 feet). Inside is a small
museum open weekdays through summer.
Digby and Digby Neck
Best-known for its plump, sweet-tasting scallops, this bustling town of
2,300 has been an important fishing center since Loyalists founded it 
in 1783.
Getting there
Digby is near the entrance to the Annapolis Basin, just off Highway 101,
halfway between Yarmouth and Wolfville.
Bay Ferries (% 888-249-7245 or 902-245-2116; www.nfl-bay.com) oper-
ates the Princess of Acadia year-round between Saint John (New Bruns-
wick) and Digby, with one or two daily departures in each direction. The
crossing takes between two and three hours. Depending on the time of
year (July to early Oct is high season) the one-way cost is C$30 to C$40
adults, C$25 to C$30 seniors, and C$20 to C$25 children aged 5 to 17. 
The fare for regular sized vehicles under 6.4m (21 feet) is C$75 to C$80
one-way.

Brier Island
Nature lovers ought to plan on spending at least one night on Brier Island,
preferably at Brier Island Lodge, perched atop sea cliffs and surrounded by
native woodlands. Staying here, you can spot whales from your room, go
bird-watching, or hike down to a narrow cove where seals haul themselves
onto the rocks. The 40 motel-like rooms are a little plain, but they are clean
and comfortable and most have ocean views. The more expensive rooms
have either a king-size bed or a jetted tub.
The restaurant is casual (open 7 a.m.–9:30 p.m.) featuring lots of exposed
wood and snappy-colored fabrics. Mains are mostly under C$20, including
smoked pollock, a local delicacy that is poached in milk and served with
a creamy white sauce.

expensive motel rooms need renovations, but many of the remaining
rooms and older cottages have kitchens and water views. The dining room
is contained in the original 1915 lodge building and is open daily 7:30 a.m.

Restaurant with tables spread right to the water’s edge. For an evening

(pan- or deep-fried) and chips is the obvious choice, but you can also
order steamed mussels, lobster, or a platter of fish, scallops, and shrimp.
The market also sells a wide variety of seafood (fresh scallops are around
C$12 per pound), perfect if you are staying somewhere with cooking facil-
ities. Otherwise, grab Digby chicks (smoked herring) for C$1 each and eat
them on the go.

Exploring Digby
Although Digby offers a couple of worthwhile sights, the main local
attraction is the drive out along Digby Neck.
Along the Harborfront
The Admiral Digby Museum, an 1850s home at 95 Montague Row 
(% 902-245-6322), documents a local history dominated by the ocean.
On display are model ships, re-created 1880s living quarters, and a large
collection of photographs. Open: Mid-June to August Tuesday to Saturday
9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 1 to 5 p.m.
In front of the Fundy Restaurant at 34 Water St., the Lady Vanessa, a
retired wooden scallop boat, is open for inspection June to September
daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. In addition to simply clambering over and into
the boat, a video shows footage of fishermen at work, and displays
include the claws of a 20-kilogram (45-pound) lobster. Admission is a
worthwhile C$2.

Driving Digby Neck
Digby Neck is a narrow finger of land that extends around 50km (31
miles) into the Bay of Fundy. Most visitors are drawn to the end of the
road by its diversity of wildlife.
Along the way you encounter a string of villages. The most picturesque
is Sandy Cove, overlooking a beach with good swimming. Ask directions
to the local waterfall, one of the highest in the Maritimes.
Highway 217 reaches right to the end of Digby Neck. From there it’s a
short ferry ride to Long Island, then an 18km (11-mile) drive to another
ferry that crosses to Brier Island. Both ferries run 24 hours per day,
year-round. Departures are timed to link up with drivers who don’t stop
in-between. The fare on either ferry is C$4 round-trip, per vehicle
(including passengers).
The ferry from the mainland docks on Long Island at Tiverton, a small
fishing village with a couple of whale-watching operations and a
museum. Around 2km (11⁄4 miles) beyond the village is a trail to the
Balancing Rock. This striking natural feature is an outcrop of igneous
(volcanic) rock that rises 7m (22 feet) from a narrow ledge above the
ocean. The 2km (1.2-mile) trail leading to the lookout platform is some-
what tricky to negotiate, but you can make the round-trip easily in 90
minutes.
If you’re feeling hungry as you approach the far end of Long Island, make
a stop in Freeport at Lavena’s Catch Café (% 902-839-2517; mid-May to
mid-Dec daily 9 a.m.–8 p.m., until 11 p.m. in summer) for well-priced
fresh seafood without a deep fryer in sight.

Around the world in 1,160 days
Born near Digby in 1844 and raised on Brier Island, Joshua Slocum left home at 16 for
a life on the high seas. After a distinguished career as captain, he set off on April 24,
1895, in the 11m (37-foot) sloop Spray on a journey that would make him famous well
beyond the sailing community. He was at sea for over three years, returning to his
starting point on June 27, 1898, thus becoming the first person to sail single-handedly
around the world.
Although Slocum remains one of the world’s best-known sailors of all time, his feat is
not well-promoted in Annapolis County — a plaque on Brier Island makes note of his
Nova Scotian links; the ferry to Brier Island is named in his honor, as is a bar at
Mountain Gap Inn; and the one-room school he attended in Hanley is now a museum.
You won’t find his grave around these parts — he was lost at sea in the southern
Atlantic in 1909.

The ferry from Freeport docks at Westport, the only settlement on Brier
Island. The island is renowned for high populations of seabirds and
excellent hiking.
Whale-watching
The Bay of Fundy teems with plankton, which attracts an abundance of
marine life — fish, whales, and dolphins are all common in the area. Of
course, that means the whale-watchers aren’t far behind. Finback,
minke, and humpback are the most common types of whales, but right
and sperm whales are also present. The main whale-watching season is
June through mid-October, with August considered the prime month.
A number of companies based along Digby Neck and on the two islands
take people to see the whales. Most use ex-fishing boats, with the cap-
tains keeping in contact with each other by radio to help track down the
whales. Trips last three to five hours (depending on how quickly whales
are found) and cost around C$50 adults, C$40 seniors, and C$26 chil-
dren. Tours with Ocean Explorations, at Tiverton (% 877-654-2341 or
902-839-2417; www.oceanexplorations.ca), are led by biologist Tom
Goodwin in large, stable Zodiac boats. The advantage of this type of
craft is speed — reaching the whales takes less time. In August, when
North Atlantic right whales (the world’s rarest whale) congregate in the
middle of the Bay of Fundy, this is the only company that can get out far
enough to see them. Also recommended is Westport-based Brier Island
Whale and Seabird Cruises (% 800-656-3660 or 902-839-2995) and
Mariner Cruises (% 800-239-2189 or 902-839-2346).
Annapolis Royal
The site of Canada’s first permanent settlement, Annapolis Royal is
under the grand delusion that it’s still the Victorian era. The French and
British fought for control of this town for over a century. In 1710, the
British finally took control and renamed it in honor of Queen Anne.
Despite its age, fewer than 1,000 people call Annapolis Royal home,
although the streets swell with summer visitors wandering the compact
downtown core.
Getting there
Annapolis Royal is 29km (18 miles) northeast of Digby Neck. Take Exit 23
from Highway 101 to follow the Annapolis Basin shoreline to town or
Exit 22 for a more direct approach.

Continuing toward Halifax from Annapolis Royal
From Annapolis Royal, Highway 101 continues to make its way along the
southern edge of the Bay of Fundy. It’s just over 200km (125 miles) back
to Halifax along this direct route. A more enticing option is Highway 1,
which heads in the same direction, but at a more relaxing pace. Reach
the following from both highways:
 Cape Split. Reaching the end of this narrow finger of land extending
almost across the Minas Channel entails an 8km (5-mile) one-way
hike, but you’re rewarded with magnificent views down to the Bay
of Fundy. On the protected eastern side of the spit, Blomidon
Provincial Park protects an impressive lineup of red cliffs. To get
to either spot, take Exit 11 from Highway 101 and follow the signs
from Highway 358.
 Wolfville. This university town (home of the well-respected Acadia
University) has an impressive array of Victorian-era homes, the
Randall House Museum at 259 Main St. (% 902-542-9775), which
catalogs the colonists who came after the Acadians had been
expelled, and a pleasant waterfront area where interpretive boards
describe the natural and human history of Minas Basin. Built by an
apple baron, Victoria’s Historic Inn at 600 Main St. (% 800-556-
5744 or 902-542-5744; www.victoriashistoricinn.com) can be
an inexpensive overnight stop or a decadent splurge, depending 
on your room choice. Regardless of how much you pay, everyone
enjoys the same gourmet breakfast. Rates are C$118 to C$245,
which is in the $$-to-$$$$ range.
 Grand Pré National Historic Site. Once the principal population
center of Acadia, this outdoor museum east of Wolfville off Highway
1 (% 902-542-3631) remembers the expulsion of Acadians in 1755.
Although the English burned their villages, the clever dyking
system Acadians developed to farm land below sea level is still
present. Also on the grounds are a church, various statues and
monuments, and a blacksmith’s shop. While the outdoor attrac-
tions are the main draw, it’s well worth also spending time in the
main interpretive center to learn a little about Acadian culture and
the deportation. Admission C$7.15 adults, C$5.90 seniors, C$3.45

Howard Dill is famous for developing pumpkin seeds that go on to
produce some of the world’s largest pumpkins, including the cur-
rent world record of 681 kilograms (1,502 pounds). The best time to

 Exploring the wild and rugged Eastern Shore
“C
entral” Nova Scotia is a somewhat arbitrary designation that
encompasses the region north of Halifax and extends east to
Cape Breton Island. This portion of the province is served by main high-
ways that lead to major population centers like Truro, New Glasgow, and
beyond. In this chapter, I encourage you to explore towns and attrac-
tions that lie beyond the highways but are still close at hand. Highlights
are as varied as watching the tidal bore created by massive tides in the
Bay of Fundy, clambering over a replica of the boat that transported
early Scottish settlers to North America, and learning to surf in the
Atlantic Ocean.
Truro
Two major highways merge at Truro, which is Nova Scotia’s third-largest
city with a population of 12,000, but many tourists pass right on by.
That’s a shame, because the Truro area offers a few notable attractions
that make a visit worthwhile.
Getting there
Highway 102 from Halifax (90km/56 miles to the south) passes west of
Truro, while the east–west Trans-Canada Highway, here called Highway
104, passes north of it. To get downtown from Highway 102, take Exit 14;
if you’re on Highway 104, take Exit 15 to Highway 102 and then Exit 14.
Staying in Truro
Truro lodgings are designed to fill the needs of overnighting highway
travelers. You can find some decent, well-priced motel rooms along the
roads linking downtown to the main highways.

Comfort Inn Truro
$$
Truro
This low-slung, two-story chain motel is handy to Highway 102, but far
enough away from it for traffic noise to be at a minimum. The midsize
rooms come with lots of amenities (wireless Internet, free local calls, in-
room coffee, hair dryers, ironing facility), and a light breakfast is included
in the rates.

Palliser Motel
$$
Truro
The older-style rooms are certainly not the attraction here: It’s quite
simply the location. Set on a low bluff above the Salmon River, this is the
prime local spot for viewing the tidal bore (the river in front of the motel
is lit at night for this purpose). The Palliser also has a restaurant, where
motel guests are offered a complimentary hot buffet breakfast and a 15
percent discount on all other meals.
Tidal Bore Road (Exit 14 from Highway 102). % 902-893-8951. Fax: 902-895-8475. Rack

Dining in Truro
Give all the usual chain restaurants on the outskirts of Truro a miss, and
take the time to search out the only local restaurant I recommend.

SEAFOOD
Who says it’s all about location? One of Nova Scotia’s best-known seafood
restaurants is in Truro, which isn’t even on the ocean — and it’s in a strip
mall to boot. Inside, the fish nets, model boats, and bright maritime murals
leave no one guessing at this restaurant’s specialty. The menu offers a wide
range of all the usual seafood suspects, but the perfectly cooked deep-fried
fish (usually cod) brings in a constant flow of locals and travelers in the
know.

Daily 11 a.m.–8 p.m.
Exploring Truro
Start your visit at the Visitor Information Centre (Victoria Square; 
% 902-893-2922; open May–Oct daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; in July–Aug extended
to daily 8 a.m.–8 p.m.), and take a downtown walking tour that focuses on
an unfortunate history with a silver lining. A few years back, Dutch elm
disease struck many of the stately elm trees lining Truro’s streets. While
trees afflicted with the same disease in other towns were destroyed, an
Part III: Nova Scotia 
148

imaginative group of locals commissioned a woodcarver to create art
from the trunks. Today, over 30 tree-trunk sculptures dot the downtown
streets. Ask for a map detailing each at the information center.
Truro doesn’t give you many reasons to linger too long, though. See the
tidal bore, and then hit the road for some quick out-of-town sightseeing.
Tidal Bore
Truro
Some of the world’s highest tides rise through the Bay of Fundy. When the
ocean water in the bay is forced up adjacent low-lying rivers, a wall of
water surges across the mudflats and funnels into the local river systems,
and you can actually see the water changing direction. Truro’s location
beside the Salmon River at the far end of the “funnel,” combined with easy
access from the highway, make the local Tidal Bore Park a favorite view-
ing spot for this intriguing sight.
Tides change just over every six hours, so the bore occurs twice daily. It
arrives approximately 50 minutes later each day, so be sure to check at
the visitor center (% 902-893-2922) for tide times.
Tidal Bore Road (Exit 14 off Highway 102 or west from downtown along Prince Street).
Admission: Free.
Balmoral Grist Mill
Balmoral Mills
Step back in time at this underrated, off-the-beaten-path attraction that
was built in 1874 and has been restored to working order. Within a bright-
red wooden building nestled in a lush valley, water tumbles through a
water wheel linked by a pulley system to a solid granite millstone that
grinds wheat and oats. Various demonstrations take place daily, with the
finished product used in a variety of baked goodies sold at the site. Not
only is Balmoral Grist Mill worth visiting for its historical interest, but the
location is delightful. Plan on enjoying a picnic lunch in the adjacent park.
Matheson Brook Road, 38km (24 miles) north of Truro off Highway 311. % 902-637-
3016. Admission: C$3.25 adults, C$2.25 seniors and children, C$7.50 families. Open:
June to mid-Oct Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Sun 1 p.m.–5:30 p.m.
Glooscap Trail
West from Truro
Named for a mythical Mi’Kmaq spirit who controlled the tides, this route
(Highway 2) follows the northern shoreline of Cobequid Bay and Minas
Basin west from Truro to Parrsboro before taking a jog north to rejoin the
Trans-Canada Highway (104) near Springhill. Although the Glooscap Trail
is in the geographical center of the Maritimes, it passes through a rela-
tively remote region, with verdant forests running down to sea cliffs and
tiny fishing villages.
Chapter 13: Central Nova Scotia 149

An obvious attraction along this stretch of highway is the scenery, but the
most interesting features are less obvious. In the 1980s, this region came
into the paleontological spotlight when more than 100,000 bone fragments
from dinosaurs were unearthed. The Fundy Geological Museum in
Parrsboro (% 902-254-3814) explains the importance of the 200-million-
year-old fossil beds. In addition, agate and amethyst are common along
this stretch of coast. Parrsboro Rock and Mineral Shop (% 902-254-
2981), operated by local dinosaur-hunting legend Eldon George, displays
various fossils (including thumbnail-sized dinosaur footprints) along with
lots of gemstones. Eldon sells you rock-collecting gear or, if he’s not busy,
takes you out to his favorite collecting grounds for around C$30 per
person.
The 1893 Maple Inn, at 2358 Western Ave. in Parrsboro (% 877-627-5346
or 902-254-3735; www.mapleinn.ca) is a good overnight choice for travel-
ers looking to soak up local history. Rates for the nine guest rooms range
C$90 to C$150 double, including breakfast.
Pictou
In 1773, about 250 hardy Scottish settlers stepped ashore at Pictou
Harbour after a treacherous trans-Atlantic journey aboard the Hector.
They were brought to the area by a Philadelphia company looking to ful-
fill the terms of a land grant. Few people from North America were will-
ing to move to the area, so the company began to look farther afield;
Acadia was renamed Nova Scotia (“New Scotland” in Latin) in a desper-
ate effort to attract Scots.
Getting there
Pictou lies on a protected harbor 12km (71⁄2 miles) north of Highway 104.
The road to Pictou is busier than you may expect, because it continues
through town to the Caribou ferry terminal, one of two gateways to
Prince Edward Island.
Staying in Pictou
This town has a good selection of historic properties that offer comfort-
able lodging without going over-the-top in décor or price.
Consulate Inn
$$–$$$
Pictou
This ivy-covered 1810 building was once a consulate for the United States,
and later a prominent local judge called it home for 50 years. Perhaps as
a result, it has a somewhat jaded air of having been-there, done-that. The
cheaper rooms may not be designer-chic, but you get a good night’s rest.
The Lower Garden Suite with basic cooking facilities is good value, but has
a low ceiling (C$79). Rooms in the modern annex all have a jetted tub and
varying water views. Out back, the garden runs all the way to the water’s
edge, with outdoor furniture, a gazebo, and a barbecue area. For families

on a budget, the adjacent house can be rented through the Consulate Inn
for C$119. All rates include breakfast.

Pictou Lodge Resort
$$–$$$$
East of Pictou
This sprawling resort occupies a prime position on Northumberland Strait.
Pictou Island is visible in the distance and water surrounds the property
on three sides, with a man-made pond thrown in for good measure.
Activities include canoeing, sea kayaking lessons, horseback riding, hiking
along nature trails, biking, or just relaxing on the private beach. The oldest
units date to the 1920s and were last renovated in 2006; some have been
given a thorough going-over (the one-bedroom deluxe cottages, complete
with kitchen and screened veranda, are my favorite), but more modern
motel units and snazzy log cabins have the better views. A summer activ-
ity program makes the lodge a great place for families.

Pictou Lodge Resort Dining Room
$$–$$$$
East of Pictou
NORTH AMERICAN
Even if you’re not staying here, take the short drive just for a meal. While
the rest of the resort has undergone numerous upgrades through the
years, the restaurant hasn’t, which is a good thing. Breakfast and lunch
are taken on the screened-in veranda, while the main dining room, with its
high ceiling, exposed log work, and massive fireplace, has a distinctly his-
torical charm. The menu also reflects an earlier era, with steak, chicken,
and seafood dishes cooked to perfection and served without frills. The
salmon, basted in maple syrup and herbs and broiled on a cedar plank, is
a real treat. Sunday brunch is also popular.
Braeshore Road. % 902-485-4322. Reservations recommended for dinner. Main
courses: C$17–C$30. AE, DISC, MC, V. Open: Mid-May to mid-Oct daily 7 a.m.–9 p.m.
Exploring Pictou
Pictou’s biggest draw is the waterfront. Plan on spending at least half a
day poking around the harbor.
Hector Heritage Quay
Pictou
This harbor complex is anchored by a full-sized floating replica of the 34m
(110-foot) Hector, the sailing ship that transported Nova Scotia’s first
Chapter 13: Central Nova Scotia 151

Scottish settlers across the Atlantic. The three-masted ship was con-
structed using traditional tools and techniques, making it the most faith-
ful reconstruction project of its kind ever undertaken in North America.
Admission includes access to the ship itself, but spending time “on land”
is worthwhile to read interpretive panels that narrate the story of the orig-
inal ship and its passengers and watch blacksmiths and carpenters at work
in their dockside shops. Guided tours at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. are offered free
with admission. This attraction is perfect for families — interesting for
adults, but the kids will have fun, too.
33 Caladh Ave., Pictou. % 902-485-4371. Admission: C$7 adults, C$5 seniors, C$2 chil-
dren 6–12. Open: Mid-May to Oct Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m. 
Northumberland Fisheries Museum
Pictou
At one time, this red-brick railway station was the eastern end of the rail
line across Canada. Now it’s an unassuming museum that’s actually pretty
interesting. The museum has an impressive collection of exhibits on
diverse ocean-related topics ranging from local marine life to the whaling
and fishing industries and racing boats. Kids will love the model boats and
tank of live lobsters. Spending an hour at this museum is easy, even if
you’re not a maritime buff.
71 Water St., Pictou. % 902-485-4972. Admission: C$4.50 adults, C$3.50 seniors, C$2
children 6–12. Open: Mid-June to mid-Oct Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun noon to 5 p.m.

Not Jost another winery
Everyone loves promoting a local product — that’s why you see wines from Jost
Vineyards (pronounced “yost”) featured in many Nova Scotia restaurants. Though it’s
situated well away from Canada’s better-known wine-producing regions, Jost has pro-
duced some award-winning products. They’re only available in Nova Scotia, so be sure
to get a sample while you’re here, especially of their award-winning ice wine. Frost is
the enemy in most vineyards, but at Jost it’s a vital part of the ice wine process. The
frozen grapes are left on the vines for a few days, and then gently pressed to extract
just a few drops of concentrated juice from each grape. The result of this low-yield
process is an intensely sweet dessert wine that sells for around C$40 per bottle. Ice
wine is only a small part of the Jost repertoire. Many classic European varietals that
reflect the owner’s German roots, including a classic Riesling, are picked at a more tra-
ditional time of year to produce bottles of wine mostly in the C$10-to-C$20 range.
Free winery tours are offered daily at noon and 3 p.m. throughout the summer.
Afterward, you can browse the wine shop, pick up some gourmet goodies at the deli,
and enjoy a picnic on the patio.
Jost Vineyards is at Malagash, east of Pictou along Highway 6 (% 902-257-2636;
www.jostwine.com). Open: June to mid-Sept daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.

Touring along Northumberland Strait
East of Pictou, Northumberland Strait is bordered by a convoluted coast-
line that extends all the way to Canso Causeway, gateway to Cape Breton
Island. Highway 104, the main route to Cape Breton, sensibly follows a
direct route well away from the coastline, leaving a variety of options for
casual touring. Here are some suggested detours along the way:
 New Glasgow. East of Pictou along Highway 104, this sprawling
town has a pleasant downtown core centered on a river. An 1841
building constructed from ship ballast has been converted to the
Dock, Food, Spirits, and Ales pub, at 130 George St. (% 902-752-
0884). Its historical origins are ignored by most patrons, who gravi-
tate to the sun-drenched patio.
 Stellarton. New Glasgow and Stellarton are separated by Highway
104, though linked by commercial sprawl. Take Exit 24 on Highway
104 to get to Eastern Canada’s largest museum, the Museum of
Industry (% 902-755-5425). This may not sound like an exciting
stop, but kids will love every minute of it — from the opportunity
to talk with a retired coal miner to printing their own bookmarks. In
keeping with the theme, you must punch a time card upon entry.
Allow at least an hour to explore. Open: Monday to Saturday 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m., Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (closed weekends outside of
summer). Admission: C$7.50 adults, C$4.50 seniors, C$3.25 chil-
dren.
 Antigonish. Pronounced An-tee-gun-ish, this busy highway town
becomes even busier during the middle weekend of July for the
Highland Games, the biggest and oldest such games outside of
Scotland. Heavyweight events like tug-o’-war and caber-tossing are
balanced by pipe-bands and performances by some of the biggest
names in Celtic music.
 Arisaig Provincial Park. This park protects coastal cliffs that tell
the 400-million-year-old story of a time when Nova Scotia was part
of a shallow sea. What makes this place particularly interesting to
scientists is that layers of sediment laid down over millions of
years have become exposed along a single cliff line, revealing a
neck-straining timeline of ancient life on earth. Digging into the cliff
for fossils is not permitted, but you are allowed to search through
fallen rubble along the beach.
Eastern Shore
Promoted as the Marine Drive (Highway 7, and then highways 211 and
316), the route between Halifax and Canso looks relatively tame on a big
map, but when it comes to negotiating the narrow, winding 320km (200-
mile) route you should allow a full day — without stops. But don’t let the
pace put you off: The slow going is the perfect excuse to take your time
and spend the night in one of the charming villages en route.
Chapter 13: Central Nova Scotia 153

Getting there
From Dartmouth, across the harbor from downtown Halifax, take Exit 7
from Highway 111. The highway is occasionally in sight of the ocean, but
the most scenic areas are along side roads. Consult a good map, and
enjoy!
Staying along the Eastern Shore
The Eastern Shore has a few excellent lodging options, but reserve
ahead of time so you don’t end up spending the night in a nondescript
roadside motel.
Liscomb Lodge
$$$
Liscomb Mills
Its location halfway between Halifax and Canso makes Liscomb Lodge a
good place for an overnight stop. Standard rooms are comfortable but
unexceptional. Paying extra for the much larger cottages is worthwhile,
even if you don’t have a family in tow. Activities like hiking and boating
will tempt you to stay longer. The resort restaurant is one of the few dining
choices along this stretch of coast, so inquire about meal packages when
booking a room (although breakfast is included in the rates).

Salmon River House Country Inn
$$
Salmon River Bridge
Less than an hour’s drive from Halifax, this lodging has been a popular get-
away for almost 100 years. The rooms have been modernized, but décor
remains a bit old-fashioned. Still, the additions of en suite bathrooms and
televisions aren’t a bad thing. Close-up river views and a wonderful restau-
rant are the real reason this place makes the cut. The self-contained guest-
house may appeal to those looking for a little more privacy.

East Lawrencetown
Popular with active travelers on a budget, this converted 1912 farmhouse
is less than 1km (1⁄2 mile) from the waves of Lawrencetown Beach. Guests
are welcome to use bikes or the canoe the hosts leave at a lake across the
road. Seaboard offers basic, comfortable accommodations, a communal
television room, a small library, and a lounge with fireplace. A hearty
breakfast with lots of homemade baked goodies gets you going in the
morning.

J. Willy Krauch & Sons Ltd.

Tangier
SEAFOOD
You’ll often see salmon in restaurants referred to as “Krauch” salmon, and
this is where it comes from. Krauch salmon is cold-smoked, which means
the fish has been salted and then smoked for up to a week at very low tem-
peratures. The process is very different from normal smoking, where the
fish literally cooks as it is smoked. Cold-smoking creates a subtle, savory
flavor and a firm texture — perfect for slicing thinly and serving on crack-
ers (it’s the most divine smoked salmon you’ll ever taste). If you worry
about consuming your purchase before it makes it home, you’ll be pleased
to know that the company ships worldwide.
Highway 7, Tangier. % 902-772-2188. Open: Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–6 p.m.
Lobster Shack
$$–$$$
Salmon River Bridge
SEAFOOD
Ahoy, matey! Even landlubbers feel at home in this small-town restaurant
with a big-time reputation. The dining room is part of the Salmon River
House Country Inn and has a pleasant riverside deck. The interior walls
are decorated in all manner of maritime memorabilia — the sort of stuff
you’d expect to find washed up on the beach after a big storm. As the
name suggests, lobster is a menu feature. To start, choose from super-
creamy lobster chowder or rich seafood dip with pita bread. If you’re seri-
ous about your lobster, choose one from the tank and order it as a main
course. Boiled lobster is boiled lobster; what sets the Lobster Shack apart
from other restaurants is the variety of sizes — up to 5 pounds on my last
visit (I was told they often hold them up to 10 pounds).

Exploring the Eastern Shore
Like the rest of the province, the Eastern Shore has a long and interest-
ing history, which can be relived at numerous attractions. But the smell
of salt in the air, the long stretches of sandy beach, and the quiet coves
are the real draw.
Fisherman’s Life Museum
Jeddore Oyster Pond
Life for an East Coast fisherman and his family 100 years ago was not easy.
This museum re-creates the simple, self-sufficient lifestyle of one such family.
Ervin Myers, the husband, spent long days at sea while his wife Ethelda
raised 13 daughters in this small green and white house. Details such as
the family’s woodstove and small pipe organ and the surrounding gardens
planted with root vegetables add to the museum’s authentic quality.

Canso Islands National Historic Site
Canso
The Canso Islands, within sight of the small town of Canso, have a long his-
tory, but today sit empty beyond the end of one of Nova Scotia’s most
remote roads. The British established an outpost on one of them, Grassy
Island, in the early 1700s, harvesting and processing 8 million cod annually.
They also made a lackadaisical attempt at fortifying the settlement, but
were unable to protect it against a 1774 attack by the French, who
destroyed the entire town. The National Historic Site has two parts; stop
by the Visitor Reception Centre along Union Street in Canso to learn more
about the history, and then take the free 15-minute boat ride across to the
island, where an interpretive trail leads past various foundations and a
well. It’s an interesting trip for the stark, end-of-the-world feel surround-
ing the site.
Access by boat from Canso % 902-366-3136. Admission: Suggested donation of C$5
includes admission to the Visitor Reception Centre and boat ride. Open: June to mid-
Sept daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Sherbrooke Village
Sherbrooke
What makes this historic park stand out from others is that the village is
an actual community, with real live Nova Scotians going about their daily
business. Sherbrooke was the site of an 1860s gold rush, and many of the
original buildings have been faithfully restored in the style of this era.
Costumed guides are on hand to talk about the village and its history, or
to give demonstrations of traditional crafts such as candle-making and old-
time photography. One of the most interesting displays is the workshop,
Part III: Nova Scotia 
156

where carpenters combine traditional skill with modern technology to pro-
duce reproductions in demand at historic sites across the province. On
Thursdays at 7:30 p.m., the village courthouse hosts the Courthouse
Concert Series, which may be anything from Celtic to country.

More cool things to do along the Eastern Shore
While the historic sites are worth a stop, the ocean takes center stage
along the Eastern Shore. Apart from the coastal scenery, it’s a great area
for trying your hand at surfing or sea kayaking, and boasts some great
beaches:
 Surfing: After surfing on both coasts of Canada, I can’t say if one is
better than the other. One thing is for certain, though: Lawrence-
town Beach, a half-hour drive from Halifax, is Canada’s best-known
surf spot. Waves break along a rocky point as well as on the beach,
with the biggest swells rolling through in winter. Dacane Surf Shop
(% 902-431-7873) charges around C$50 per day for rental of surf-
board and wet suit (you’ll need one, even in summer). Lessons are
also offered from their beachside outlet.
 Sea kayaking: Even if you’ve never been near a sea kayak, the
guides at Coastal Adventures, based at Tangier (% 877-404-2774
or 902-772-2774; www.coastaladventures.com), make you feel
comfortable in the water. The full-day beginner course (C$120 per
person) is as much a tour as a lesson, with an introduction to basic
paddling skills followed by a trip to an uninhabited island and
lunch. You’re in safe hands with co-owner Dr. Scott Cunningham,
who could write a book on the subject — and in fact has (Sea
Kayaking in Nova Scotia).
 Beach walking: Okay, this activity is a little less adventurous than
the others, but nothing’s like feeling sand between your toes and
breathing in the smells of the ocean. Best of all, it’s free. As Nova
Scotia’s longest stretch of sand (5km/3 miles), Martinique Beach,
south of Musquodoboit Harbour, is a good option for an extended
beach walk. It’s protected as a provincial park and is dotted with
day-use areas and access paths. Continuing north from Martinique
Beach, Taylor Head Provincial Park protects a narrow spit of land
lined by glorious white-sand beaches along its protected eastern
side.

 Stepping back in time at the Fortress of Louisbourg
C
ape Breton Island is a Maritimes gem. It offers plenty of breathtak-
ing coastal scenery and a dash of Canadian history, coupled with
that unmistakable down-home East Coast charm you hear so much
about. Joined to the mainland by a causeway, the island is renowned for
its rugged coastline, although mountains, lakes, and salmon-filled rivers
add to the diversity inland. The Cabot Trail, a 300km (186-mile) road that
winds its way around Cape Breton Highlands National Park, is the
island’s top attraction.
History buffs will be satiated at Canada’s largest historical reconstruc-
tion, the Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site. It reminds us that
the French once held sovereignty to the island after ceding the rest of
the province to the British in 1713.
A big part of this region’s appeal is the people (“Cape Bretoners”), many
of them proudly descended from Scots who were attracted by the
island’s strong resemblance to their homeland. The island’s most
famous resident was born in Scotland himself: Alexander Graham Bell.
He, like so many others, was captivated by this unique part of the coun-
try and called Baddeck home for much of his life.
You need your own vehicle to make the most of a visit to Cape Breton
Island.
Plan on spreading the wealth around when it comes to lodging. One
night at a historic inn at Baddeck and another at a beachy resort along
the Cabot Trail is the perfect combination for a two-night stay.

Baddeck
Halfway up the island, the delightful resort town of Baddeck is a good
central location to plan an overnight (or longer) stay. The town’s most
famous resident was Alexander Graham Bell, who spent summers and
then the last three decades of his life at a stately waterfront mansion
across the bay from Baddeck. Bell’s descendants own the home, but one
of the province’s best museums that tells his interesting life story is in
town. Down on the waterfront, a free ferry shuttles visitors to Kidston
Island for hiking and swimming, while other tour boats can take you to
search out nesting bald eagles.
Getting there
Take Highway 105 north from the Canso Causeway, and in less than an
hour you’re greeted by a bombardment of Baddeck billboards.
Staying in Baddeck
Whether you’re looking to spend your day at a waterfront resort or a
character-laden historic lodging, you can find your perfect accommoda-
tions in Baddeck.
Summer is very busy in Baddeck, so reservations are necessary for local
lodging. If you do arrive without having booked a room, stop at the cen-
trally located Baddeck Welcome Centre (% 902-295-1911) for sugges-
tions.
Bethune’s Boathouse Cottage
$$
Baddeck
The name says it all: This small cottage is a converted boathouse on the
Baddeck waterfront. Inside is a double bed, bathroom, and living area with
a television and radio. Do your cooking on an outside barbecue. The cot-
tage sits on its own small lot but is not particularly private. If you feel like
getting away, simply take to the water in the complimentary rowboat.
49 Water St. % 902-295-2687. Rack rates: C$120 double. No credit cards. Open: Mid-
May to mid-Oct.
Inverary Resort
$$–$$$$
Baddeck
Kids in particular enjoy this resort on the south side of Baddeck. It’s not
really within walking distance of town, but why would you want to leave
when you’ve got tennis courts, a spa facility, an indoor pool, a fitness
center, a large playground, boat and kayak rentals, and sailing trips aboard
a boat once owned by Alexander Graham Bell? The rooms vary from those
of the original building to modern, fully equipped suites with private bal-
conies. The resort also has two restaurants and a lounge. Golf and meal
packages can be a good deal.

Telegraph House
$–$$$
Baddeck
Built in 1861 and now run by the fifth generation of the same family, this
imposing gray-and-white inn on a main street was once a telegraph office.
Rooms in the main lodge are basic and some are very small, but all are
clean and comfortable, and the location can’t be more central. Alexander
Graham Bell often stayed in Room 1 when in town — do you need a better
recommendation? Behind the main lodge is a wing of more modern motel
rooms decorated in a vaguely Victorian décor. They may lack the history
of those in the original building but are good value, especially the extra-
large ones which are ideal for families. Finally, a self-contained cabin is
available for those who like to really spread out.

Water’s Edge Inn
$$–$$$
Baddeck
Water’s Edge Inn overlooks the lake and Kidston Island, and is just a couple
of blocks downhill from the main street. Paying extra for one of the four
rooms with private balconies and water views is worthwhile, although all
six are well-appointed and come with niceties such as DVD players, air-
conditioning, and original art. A lounge is stocked with books and a com-
puter for guest Internet access. The inn is also home to a cafe (open daily
for breakfast and lunch) and an art gallery.

Dining in Baddeck
Restaurants line the main street through Baddeck, but some of the
better dining choices are associated with local lodgings.
Baddeck Lobster Suppers

In typical lobster-supper style (or lack of it), this traditional Maritimes
feast is replayed for tourists in a dining hall across from the waterfront. At
dinner, pay C$30 for one full lobster and all-you-can-eat mussels, seafood
chowder, salad, bread rolls, dessert, and non-alcoholic drinks. Lunch offers
similar choices from a regular menu, such as a lobster roll for C$9.

Tucked inside a historic residence that has been converted to an inn, this
smallish dining room features a crisp Victorian color scheme with the
modern addition of a deck wrapped around two sides. For starters, the
menu covers all bases, with nachos, mussels, and chicken soup (with
loads of chicken). Entrees are no less diverse, with choices ranging from
a charbroiled T-bone to grilled rainbow trout splashed with a corn salsa.

Exploring Baddeck
Baddeck isn’t big on traditional official “sights,” but it’s still a delightful
town to visit. Chebucto Street is the main thoroughfare, but walk 1 block
down Jones Street to reach the waterfront and find yourself in the real
heart of the town.
Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site
Baddeck
Like most kids, I learned in school that Alexander Graham Bell invented
the telephone, but it wasn’t until I spent a few hours in this museum that
I realized the extent of his contribution to the world of science and engi-
neering. The first exhibit explains Bell’s achievements in teaching the deaf
(including Helen Keller) to speak, using a phonetic alphabet developed by
his father. Spend some time at this display, as the interpretive panels go on
to explain how this early work was inextricably linked to his later experi-
menting with transmitting sound along wire using voice pulsations. This,
of course, led to Bell’s patenting of the world’s first telephone in 1876. The
rest of the museum is devoted to his lesser-known inventions, such as the
world’s first hydrofoil and first seaplane. Among the various replicas and
original parts on display is the Silver Dart, with which Bell broke the world
speed record on Bras d’Or Lake. As a symbol of Bell’s work with children,
part of the museum is set aside for kids, with puzzles, experiments, and
kite-making.

Other cool things to see and do in Baddeck
Relax at an outdoor cafe, wander down to the waterfront or, if you’re
feeling more active, consider one of the following:
 Set Sail. The Elsie (% 902-295-3500) is a gracious sailing boat
once owned by Alexander Graham Bell. It departs the Inverary
Resort daily at 10:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. for a three-hour tour on
Bras d’Or Lake. Keep an eye out for Alexander Graham Bell’s man-
sion, and you may spy a bald eagle along the way. The cost is C$65
per person.
 Paddle over to Kidston Island. Protected as a park, this uninhab-
ited island lies just across a narrow channel from Baddeck. It has a
beach, nature trails, and even a lighthouse. A free ferry departs
Government Wharf for the island every 20 minutes, but renting a
canoe or kayak from Harvey’s is more enjoyable, which is beside
Government Wharf (% 902-295-3318).
 Take a drive through the Margaree Valley. West of Baddeck, the
southernmost section of the Cabot Trail follows the Margaree River,
famed in fishing circles for its high concentrations of salmon. At the
Margaree Salmon Museum in North Margaree (% 902-248-2848)
find out about the salmon’s lifecycle from guides or on your own.
It’s open mid-June to mid-October daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and entry
is just C$1. North of the museum, potter Bell Fraser sells her dis-
tinctive ocean-inspired pieces at Cape Breton Clay in the village of
Margaree Valley (% 902-235-2467).
Chapter 14: Cape Breton Island 163
Cape Bretoners and their music
Wherever you travel on Cape Breton Island, you hear Celtic-based music. It’s incred-
ibly popular with the local population, and so catchy that you can’t help but be capti-
vated by its spirit and energy. Cape Bretoners Natalie MacMaster, Ashley MacIsaac,
The Rankins, and The Irish Descendants have introduced this music to the world, but
visiting the island itself is the best way to immerse yourself in the traditions of Celtic
song and dance. To find great places to go for a night out, ask a local, check enter-
tainment listings in newspapers, or simply wander the streets listening for live music.
One event worth noting is the Celtic Colours International Festival (% 877-285-2321
or 902-562-6700; www.celtic-colours.com), held the second week of October
with the magnificent backdrop of fall’s blazing colors. Celtic musicians from around
the world perform in over 40 island towns in churches, halls, and theaters.

 Dance the night away. The Baddeck Gathering Ceilidhs is a
nightly performance by local musicians in St. Michael’s Parish Hall
on Main Street (% 902-295-2794). Entry costs just C$8 for adults
and C$4 for children; tea, coffee, and oatcakes are each C$2. All the
action gets underway at 7:30 p.m., July and August only.
Cape Breton Highlands National Park 
and the Cabot Trail
Everyone falls in love with this spectacular national park, which
stretches across the top of Cape Breton Island. Sea cliffs and rocky
coves dominate the west side and long sandy beaches run down the east
side, with a vast plateau of wilderness in between. The Cabot Trail, one
of Canada’s most scenic drives, loops through the park and weaves
along both coasts, ensuring that you miss nothing. Wildlife viewing is
excellent: Most visitors spot moose, whales, and bald eagles, often with-
out even leaving their vehicles.
Getting there
Unless you plan to traverse the Cabot Trail by bike, you need your own
vehicle. To reach the main park gate, turn off Highway 105 south of
Baddeck.
Paying entrance fees
The park entry fee of C$6.90 adults, C$5.90 seniors, C$3.45 youths, to a
maximum of C$17 per vehicle, is good until 4 p.m. the day following its
purchase. Passes can be purchased at the information center north of
Chéticamp or at the tollbooths at both park entrances. If you have a
National Parks of Canada Pass (refer to Chapter 5), you’ll be waved
right on through.
Arriving at the park’s main entrance
Make your first stop the Chéticamp Visitor Centre (% 902-224-2306),
5km (3 miles) north of Chéticamp. It’s open May to June and September
to mid-October daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., July to August daily 8 a.m. to 8
p.m. Inside, natural history exhibits provide a good introduction to the
park, and posted activities schedules help in planning your time.
Friendly staff at the information desk supply free maps and help you
decide which hiking trails best suit your abilities. Off to one side is Les
Amis du Plein Air (% 902-224-3814), a bookstore that stocks park-
related literature and a wide selection of general outdoor and nature
guides.

salon, and nightly beachside bonfires. The least expensive units are road-
side motel rooms. Older cottages come with a kitchen and up to two bed-

the best guest rooms in all of the Maritimes: Luxuriously appointed, they
still manage to maintain a casual air — you can happily tramp sand in with-
out feeling guilty. Each air-conditioned unit has a private veranda or bal-
cony, separate sleeping quarters, a jetted tub, a kitchen, and comfortable
couches set around a gas fireplace. Resort dining includes a restaurant
open for three meals and the charmingly named Thirsty Hiker Pub with

Sharing a narrow peninsula that juts into Ingonish Bay with the famous
Highland Links golf course, the Keltic Lodge is one of Canada’s most fash-
ionable resorts. A short drive from the Cabot Trail leads to the perfectly
positioned main lodge, on an isthmus high above the ocean and with water
views to the north and south. The nationalistic red-and-white exterior con-
trasts starkly with the surrounding blues and greens. Dating to the 1940s,
this is the original lodge, with older rooms, a restaurant and lounge, and
Chapter 14: Cape Breton Island 165

the main lobby. Guests also have the use of a heated outdoor pool, and
spa services; and the concierge can make bookings for tennis, whale-
watching, and fishing. You don’t need to be a registered guest to get a tee
time at Highland Links or to hike out to the tip of Middle Head, but you
feel more like you belong if you are. The rooms are a little on the small
side, but are outfitted in smart heritage color schemes. Regardless, you’ll
find yourself enjoying the outdoors for much of your stay. Rooms in the
main lodge are a little old-fashioned, while those in the Inn at Keltic are
motel-like, but air-conditioned and just steps away from a grassy area with
a gazebo and colorful Adirondack chairs. The four-bedroom cottages can
be rented as an entire unit or with guests sharing a communal living area.

real surprise on the seafood-dominated menu. You can order favorites like
beer-battered fish and chips for as little as C$10, but I encourage you to
be more adventurous. The grilled salmon, bookended by crab cakes to
start and a slice of blueberry shortcake for dessert, sets you back around
C$38. The extensive salad bar, complete with mussels and chowder, is an
additional C$9, or you can have it as a meal in itself for C$13.

This is casual Cape Breton dining at its very best. The Chowder House is in
a weather-beaten building on a headland through the village of Neil’s
Harbour. Don’t be put off by the pine-paneled décor: The food is super-fresh
and very well priced. The clam chowder is chockablock with juicy clams
and costs just C$5 per bowl; a lobster burger costs C$10; or you can order
the most expensive item on the menu board, a full lobster with fries and
coleslaw, for C$22. After you decide, order at the counter and listen for your
number. The restaurant is totally enclosed, which is a bit of a shame — if
it’s a nice day, I recommend spreading a blanket out on the grassy head-
land.

South Ingonish Beach
SEAFOOD
The delightfully named Muddy Rudder is part restaurant, part attraction,

Harbour with a few plastic outdoor table settings off to one side. Choose
from lobster, crab, mussels, or clams, all of which are cooked to order in
big pots of boiling water out front. Prices are a little higher than at a local
seafood market, but a lot lower than at a regular restaurant. While
researching this edition, my wife and I enjoyed the biggest plate of mussels
I’ve ever seen (C$7), followed by a full crab that came with tea cakes and
coleslaw (C$19), and we just happened to have a bottle of red from Jost
Vineyards (refer to Chapter 13) in the car, which the owner happily opened
for us.

Attached to the resort of the same name, missing this small oceanfront
dining room is easy to do as you scoot along the eastern side of the Cabot
Trail. It has no menu as such; the chef simply uses available seafood to
create a half-dozen dishes (along with at least one vegetarian option),
which are written up on a blackboard. I picked a creamy lobster linguini
(C$22), and the lobster was boiled especially for my order. A rather
refined-looking couple seated next to me were gleefully tucking into snow
crab — complete with bibs (on them, not the crabs).

Exploring the Cabot Trail
The Cabot Trail, parts of which I cover elsewhere in this chapter, is a
300km (186-mile) route that takes in not just Cape Breton Highlands
National Park, but also the coastal drive south from the park to St. Ann’s
and on to Baddeck, and then through the Margaree Valley to Chéticamp.
Here I detail the spectacular 110km (68-mile) section inside the park.
Highlights along the way
Although the distance is only a little over 100km (62 miles) between
Chéticamp and Ingonish, allow at least one full day for this stretch of
highway, simply due to the number of interesting stops en route. The
road is steep and narrow in some sections but is not difficult to drive.
Pullouts and viewpoints are spaced along the entire route. Do not use
the narrow shoulder as your personal parking space.
My description of the Cabot Trail follows a clockwise direction. I could
have gone either way, but by following this course, you hit the main
information center first up and complete the drive on the east side of
the peninsula, where you find most of my recommended accommoda-
tions and restaurants.
Part III: Nova Scotia 
168

The most dramatic section of the entire Cabot Trail is the 45km (28-mile)
stretch along the west coast. The scenery kicks off in a big way almost
immediately, with the road hugging the shoreline, ascending precipitous
sea cliffs, and then dropping back down to sea level. Stop at as many
overlooks as your time allows; take in the scenery and read the interpre-
tive boards.
One particularly scenic overlook is the Veterans Monument, 18km (11
miles) north of the park entrance. When I last made the stop, a moose
and her calf were grazing in the open meadows below while a whale
could be seen in the ocean beyond and a black bear foraged on the high
hills behind.
After an inland detour, the road descends steeply via a series of switch-
backs to reach sea level at Pleasant Bay, just outside the park boundary.
This small village, which existed well before road access was possible,
now takes full advantage of summer traffic with a variety of tourist serv-
ices. It tries hard to function primarily as a fishing village, but the harbor
is filled with whale-watching boats and sea kayakers. The Whale
Interpretive Centre, at 104 Harbour Rd. (% 902-224-1411; open June to
mid-Oct daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.) has displays on the various species you
may see out on a whale-watching trip. Admission is C$5 for adults, C$4
for seniors and children.
From Pleasant Bay, the Cabot Trail begins its ascent to a high plateau,
reentering the national park after a few minutes’ drive. Just inside the
boundary is Lone Shieling, the stone replica of a Scottish crofter’s hut.
It is also the starting point for a short trail leading to a grove of 350-year-
old sugar maple trees. Continuing eastward, the road traverses a stunted
taiga (mostly evergreen) forest before reaching a turn off to Cape North.
This side road skirts Aspy Bay, where a plaque and statue commemo-
rate John Cabot’s 1497 landfall. It then crosses to the northern tip of the
island and the picturesque fishing communities of Bay St. Lawrence,
Capstick, and Meat Cove — Cape Breton living in its rawest state.
After a side trip to Cape North, you have no choice but to backtrack
before rejoining the Cabot Trail for its final push across the peninsula.
Although the landscape on the east coast is less dramatic than the west,
it’s no less captivating, with long stretches of sand broken by rocky
headlands. Highlights include the beach at Black Brook Cove and
Lakies Head Lookout. Continuing south, the Cabot Trail leaves the park
again. Along this section, it passes four villages with Ingonish in their
names, although in reality, they merge into one long strip broken only by
Middle Head, a narrow peninsula that holds one of Canada’s finest golf
courses and the grand Keltic Lodge. Beyond Ingonish, the Cabot Trail
leaves the national park for a final time, making its last grand ascent to
Cape Smokey, one of the most dramatic lookouts along the entire trail.
Chapter 14: Cape Breton Island 169

Hiking the highlands
You can enjoy the park’s spectacular scenery from the inside of your
vehicle easily enough, but to really appreciate the place, get out onto the
hiking trails (free trail maps at the information center). Stray away from
the road to experience the park’s natural beauty on my favorite of the
park’s trails:
 Le Buttereau Trail: An easy trail to get you started. This 1.6km 
(1-mile) loop starts just north of the tollbooth, with views across 
a large lagoon and across a meadow cleared by early Acadian set-
tlers. Plan a dawn walk for the best bird-watching, or wait until
dusk to watch the sun set over the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
 Skyline Trail: The Skyline is a high ridge with a long but easy trail
leading to a magnificent viewpoint where you can often spot whales
frolicking below. The trail head is on the left as the Cabot Trail
heads inland beyond French Mountain. Allow three hours for the
9.2km (5.7-mile) round-trip.
 Benjie’s Lake Trail: You can reach this small lake easily in 30 min-
utes from a parking lot 6km (3.7 miles) beyond the Skyline Trail. As
most visitors spend their time along the coastline, visiting this lake
is a good way to escape the crowds — and you may even spy
moose along the way.
 Fishing Cove Trail: Two trails make the steep descent to this small
bay along an otherwise inaccessible stretch of coastline. The first,
beginning 3km (1.9 miles) north of Benjie’s Lake Trail, is 8km (5
miles) each way. Farther north, another trail is much shorter
(4km/2.5 miles) but a lot steeper. Either way, pack a lunch and
something to drink.
 Jigging Cove Lake Trail: On the park’s east coast, 4km (2.5 miles)
south of Neil’s Harbour, this lake lies just out of sight of the high-
way. It’s encircled by a 2.4km (1.5-mile) trail that you can hike in
well under an hour.
 Jack Pine Loop: Escape the crowds at Black Brook Cove by scram-
bling through the boulders at the north end of the beach to reach
the beginning of this 2.3km (1.4-mile) loop which weaves through
coastal forest. You’ll be back on your beach towel in less than an
hour, even if you stop to read the interpretive boards along the
way.
 Middle Head Trail: Drive as far as you can through the grounds of
the Keltic Lodge, and then walk for 1.9km (1.2 miles) to the very
end of a narrow peninsula surrounded by dramatic cliffs. If you’re
staying at the Keltic Lodge, join a 9:30 a.m. guided walk to learn
about the flora and fauna as you go.
Part III: Nova Scotia 
170

 Freshwater Lake Loop: As the trail head is Ingonish Beach, one of
Canada’s finest stretches of sand, you may find that motivating
yourself to leave the beach is the hardest part of taking this easy
2km (1.2-mile) loop trail. Walking the path at dusk is a good oppor-
tunity to watch beavers hard at work — and you won’t feel so bad
about not being on the beach.
Other cool reasons to stop along the Cabot Trail
Apart from driving and hiking, consider the following options:
 Whale-watching: From the village of Pleasant Bay, you can take a
tour boat to see whales frolicking along the coast. Commonly
sighted species are pilot, humpback, and minke whales. The follow-
ing operators are Coast Guard–certified, have partly covered ves-
sels, and are run by experienced captains who have a wealth of
knowledge: Cabot Trail Whale Watching (% 902-224-1976),
Captain Mark’s Whale & Seal Cruise (% 888-754-5112 or 902-
224-1316), and Fiddlin’ Whale Tours (% 866-688-2424). Typically,
tours last 90 minutes and cost C$25 to C$30 for adults and C$12 to
C$15 for children. Each operator has a booth along the marina at
Pleasant Bay, but advance reservations are recommended. All
cruises are weather permitting — if the captain decides not to go
sail because of rough seas, you probably don’t want to be out on
the water anyway.
The advantage of choosing a whale-watching trip at Pleasant Bay
over other locations throughout the Maritimes is that it’s only a
short ride to where the whales are, so you get to spend more time
watching and less time traveling.
 Sea-kayaking: The protected water of St. Ann’s Bay, south of
Ingonish, is an ideal place to kayak. You’re likely to spot eagles and
whales while visiting inaccessible-by-foot beaches, sea caves, and
tidal pools. Twice daily, North River Kayak Tours (% 888-865-2925
or 902-929-2628; www.northriverkayak.com) offers a half-day
(actually, around a three-hour) trip for C$55 and a full-day trip for
C$99. I recommend the full-day option. Great for first-timers and
families, you practice basic paddling techniques and then head off
to a sea cave; keep a lookout for eagles and mink along the way.
The turnaround point is a remote beach where lunch is prepared.
The cost includes kayak rental, instruction, lunch (steamed mus-
sels if you’re lucky), and maybe a friendly wave from the lighthouse
keeper as you pass his posting. Overnight and multi-day trips
explore more remote waters, including the Roughing It and
Romance overnight excursion, which includes camping gear, all
meals, and guidance to a remote beach for C$249 per person.
 Beaching it: The best beaches are on the eastern side of the park.
Black Brook Cove is somewhat protected from wind and ocean
swells, creating a safe swimming spot. This sandy beach is backed
Chapter 14: Cape Breton Island 171

by a grassy picnic area. Continuing south, Ingonish Beach is a long
stretch of sand, well protected by Middle Head. The shallow water
is warm, and a short section is patrolled through summer daily
from noon.
 Golfing: A 1939 Stanley Thompson layout, Highland Links, near
Ingonish (% 800-441-1118 or 902-285-2600; www.highlandlinks
golf.com) is consistently rated as one of the world’s top 100
courses by Golf Magazine. Although not overwhelming by today’s
standards, it’s a classic links-style course with a dramatic coastal
setting. In keeping with the Scottish theme, each hole has a name,
with both English and the Gaelic translation signed at the teebox
(Hole 6, for example, is Mucklemouth Meg, the nickname for a girl
with a big mouth, in reference to a pond that swallows wayward
golf balls). Greens fees are C$73 to C$100 during peak season, drop-
ping to just C$45 for twilight golfing during the shoulder season
(June and Oct).
Shopping
Shopping? In a national park? Well, sort of. Cape Breton Island is known
for its artists and, with the large number of tourists, many have set up
shop in the tiny villages that lie on the edge of the park. Most are open
long hours through summer, shorter hours during the shoulder seasons,
and then close completely for winter.
I list the following in a clockwise direction from Chéticamp: Beyond the
top of the park at Dingwell, Arts North (% 902-383-2732) showcases the
driftwood whale carvings of owner Linda Doyon, the jewelry of Johanna
Padelt, and the hooked rugs of Maggie Miller. One of the island’s best-
known painters is Christopher Gorey, whose oil and watercolor land-
scapes are sold at Lynn’s Craft Shop & Christopher Gorey Gallery, at
Ingonish (% 902-285-2845). Tartans and Treasures at South Harbour
(% 902-383-2005) claims to have North America’s largest collection of
tartan scarves and blankets. Most products come directly from the
mother country, so you know you’re buying the real thing. Iron Art &
Photographs, south of Ingonish at Tarbot (% 902-929-2318), combines
the hand-forged ironwork of Gordon Kennedy with the striking hand-
tinted black-and-white photography of his wife, Carol, to make a worth-
while stop on the road back to Baddeck.
Louisbourg
Over 250 years ago the French were driven from the lonely outpost of
Louisbourg, on the remote eastern tip of Cape Breton Island. Today, it’s
one of the most interesting historical sites in all of the Maritimes, with
lodging and other tourist services in an adjacent town of the same name
(population 1,200) and an ambitious C$300-million resort development
taking shape along the adjacent coastline.
Part III: Nova Scotia 
172

Getting there
Louisbourg is 45km (28 miles) southeast of Sydney along Highway 22. No
public transportation reaches the town.
Staying in Louisbourg
Even though it’s at the end of the road, Louisbourg has several comfort-
able lodgings within walking distance of the fort, including these two
recommendations.
Cranberry Cove Inn
$$–$$$
Louisbourg
You can’t miss this three-story, cranberry-red inn as you head out to the
fortress. Inside, the décor is a little tamer. Each of seven guest rooms has
its own theme. The top-floor Captain’s Den, for example, has a quirky
layout (thanks to the gabled roof), a cheery maritime color scheme, wire-
less Internet, a gas fireplace, and a jetted tub. Downstairs is a parlor, in
which three generations of the same family used to spend their evenings
during the inn’s former life. Breakfast is included in the rates and is served
on the sunny side of the house.
12 Wolfe St. % 800-929-0222 or 902-733-2171. www.cranberrycoveinn.com.
Rack rates: C$105–C$160 double. AE, MC, V. Open: May–Oct.
Point of View
$$–$$$
Louisbourg
This modern oceanfront property hogs the prime spot on a high headland
within walking distance of both the town and the fortress. It sprawls over
1.6 hectares (4 acres) of well-maintained grounds, with a private beach at
one corner of the property. Inside, the units have a sleek, contemporary
styling, hardwood floors, and sliding doors that open to either a balcony
or veranda. The apartments are much larger than the suites and come with
a full kitchen.
At the front of the property is a beach house where the owners host a
nightly Feast for the Senses. It’s a casual gathering of guests, who are
served steamed lobster and crab with all the trimmings and entertained
with storytelling or a singalong. Breakfast isn’t included in the rates, but
is available, eggs, bacon and all, for just C$4 per person.
15 Commercial St. Extension. % 888-374-8439 or 902-733-2080. www.louisbourg

Dining in Louisbourg
Plan on eating lunch at one of the three restaurants at the Fortress of
Louisbourg. If you’re staying at Point of View Suites, reserve a spot at
their nightly lobster supper. If not, this single recommendation is a good
one.
Chapter 14: Cape Breton Island 173

Grubstake Restaurant
$$–$$$
Louisbourg
SEAFOOD
Over 35 years ago a group of well-traveled friends got together and opened
this restaurant that serves local cuisine to visitors from around the world.
Not much has changed since, and no one seems to mind. The restaurant
is casual and cozy, and the seafood is done without a deep fryer in sight.
If you order the oversize Seafood Pasta Extreme, plan to give dessert a
miss; or, for something lighter, try halibut poached in milk and white wine,
fish cakes with baked beans, or a vegetarian stir-fry.
7499 Main St. % 902-733-2308. Dinner reservations accepted. Main courses:
C$10–C$25. MC, V. Open: Daily noon to 8:30 p.m., later in July and Aug.
Exploring Louisbourg
Even if you don’t like history lessons, a little background is necessary to
set the scene for a visit to the Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic
Site. After the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, all the land the French were left
with in the Maritimes were Prince Edward Island and Île Royale (Cape
Breton Island), the latter a base for a lucrative codfishing industry. Wary
of an attack on their sovereignty, the French established a massive
fortress around the Louisbourg village to repel an attack from the ocean,
but in 1745, the British came from behind and took it in a little more than
six weeks. After the fortifications changed hands on two more occa-
sions, the British destroyed them and burned the village to the ground
in 1760. Two hundred years later, with many Cape Breton coal mines
closing, the federal government decided to begin the daunting task of
rebuilding the entire village and fort as a make-work project. The result
is Canada’s largest historical reconstruction — a must-see for anyone
traveling around Cape Breton Island.
Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site
Plan on spending the better part of a full day on the grounds. Start by
watching the video at the interpretive center, and then catch the shuttle
to the back of the fort to get going on your exploration of the site. Every
detail of the original fort and village has been re-created, down to the con-
struction techniques and materials. Even the social structure is histori-
cally correct, with ostentatious homes of the rich filled with fine china and
French wines, while ramshackle working-class abodes have earthen floors
and wood stoves for heating. Around 100 costumed interpreters do a won-
derful job of playing their parts. Actually, if you ask them, they won’t admit
they’re playing a part at all — a military officer may sternly ask if you’re
spying for the British, or a carpenter may complain about how much
harder it is to get materials in Canada than back in France, while vendors
peddle their wares on cobblestoned streets.
Traditional menus and costumed servers depict 1700s life at three eater-
ies. Hotel de la Marine and Grandchamps Inn are where regular folk eat;
no meat is served on days of abstinence (Fri and Sat), and customers eat
with only a large spoon. Expect to pay around C$15 ($$) for lunch at either
Part III: Nova Scotia 
174

of these two restaurants. If you arrive at the settlement with limited funds,
head to King’s Bakery, where a loaf of heavy bread and a hunk of cheese
cost less than a single appetizer at the other eateries.

New Brunswick

In this part . . . 
N
ew Brunswick is a quiet achiever — though it’s the
biggest of the Maritime provinces, it’s not so familiar to
outsiders as a tourist destination. Spend any time there and,
like me, you’ll wonder why it’s not more popular. Here, I cover
New Brunswick’s three main cities: Moncton, with its distinct
Acadian ﬂavor; historic Saint John, Canada’s oldest city; and
the stately provincial capital, Fredericton. Follow my lead to
go swimming in the warm waters off the Acadian Coast, ﬁsh-
ing for lobsters in Northumberland Strait, searching out “kiss-
ing bridges” along the Saint John River, and marveling at the
Fundy tide phenomenon.

M
oncton, which due to its location at the geographic center of the
Maritimes serves as a transportation and business hub, began in
the 1720s as an Acadian settlement. Today, a third of its 97,000 residents
are French-speaking, and it’s the only officially bilingual city in Canada.
The influence of Acadian culture is everywhere you go — all signage is 
in both English and French, and residents greet you in both official lan-
guages. Moncton University is the largest French university outside
Quebec in Canada.
The nearest stretch of coastline is along Northumberland Strait, near the
resort town of Shediac, which is renowned for long beaches and warm
water. The region north of Shediac is known as the Acadian Coast for 
its long association with Acadians who returned to the Maritimes after
being expelled from Nova Scotia by the British in 1755. The city itself 
has two quirky natural attractions: a tidal bore, which moves up the
Petitcodiac River twice daily, and a hill with a seemingly magnetic pull.
Getting To Moncton
Moncton is an excellent starting point for a Maritimes vacation. In addi-
tion to its location at the geographic center of the region, flights there
are often cheaper than they are to Halifax, which is just a three-hour
drive to the southeast. You can also roll into the city by rail or bus.

Moncton

By plane
Greater Moncton International Airport (www.gmia.ca) is off Champlain
Street (Route 132), 8km (5 miles) east from downtown. It’s served by Air
Canada, CanJet, and WestJet (see the Appendix for toll-free numbers and
Web sites), with direct flights originating in Halifax, St. John’s, Montreal,
Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, and Newark (New Jersey). Fares between air-
lines are generally competitive, but check each for specials.
All passengers departing Greater Moncton International Airport must
contribute C$15 to the Airport Improvement and Reconstruction Fund.
Unlike for most other airports, the fee is not included in the ticket price
and you must make payment at a booth inside the main terminal.
Air Cab (% 506-857-2000) is one of many local cab companies serving
the airport. You don’t need to call, as taxis always wait out front of the
main terminal. The metered fare to downtown is around C$18. Avis,
Budget, Hertz, and National have desks at the airport (see the Appendix
for the toll-free numbers and Web sites of major car rental agencies).
By car
If you’re driving around the Maritimes, chances are you’ll pass through
Moncton at some stage of your travels. Here’s how to enter the city from
a variety of directions:
 Route 2 from Nova Scotia: Take Exit 467 for downtown or Exit 450
for Magnetic Hill.
 Route 15 from Shediac and the Confederation Bridge: Pass under
Route 2 and follow the signs right into downtown.
 Route 114 from Hopewell Rocks: Cross the Petitcodiac River via
one of two bridges — the first to reach downtown, the second to
loop around the western edge of the city to Magnetic Hill.
 Route 2 from Fredericton: Take Exit 466 (Route 128) for downtown
or Exit 450 for Magnetic Hill.
By train or bus
VIA Rail’s Ocean train passes through Moncton on its daily (except Tues)
run between Montreal and Halifax. The station is off Main Street, on the
southwest side of downtown (% 888-842-7245; www.viarail.ca).
Acadian (% 800-567-5151 or 506-859-5060; www.acadianbus.com)
buses arrive and depart from a centrally located depot at 961 Main St.
(corner of Bonaccord Street). The building is open Monday to Friday
7:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and weekends 9 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Some destina-
tions linked to Moncton that are served by Acadian include the Acadian
Coast, Prince Edward Island, Halifax, Fredericton, and Saint John.
Chapter 15: Moncton and the Acadian Coast 183

Getting Around Moncton
Except for morning and evening weekday rush hours, driving around
Moncton is easy. The downtown core spreads out around a bend in the
Petitcodiac River. Main Street, which runs parallel to the river, is the
main thoroughfare. To the east is suburban Dieppe, while south across
the Petitcodiac is Riverview. The city’s fun sights are 9km (51⁄2 miles)
northwest of downtown at Magnetic Hill, on the north side of Route 2.
Parking
Finding parking in downtown Moncton isn’t too difficult if you know
where to look. The best bet for a spot is Moncton Market, on
Westmorland Street south of Main Street, where parking costs C$1 per
hour to a maximum of C$7 per day (free on weekends). Metered street
parking is C$1 an hour, but it’s not monitored weekdays after 6 p.m. or
on weekends.
Cabbing It
Hailing a cab from the street is possible, but it’s easier in front of a major
hotel such as the Delta Beausejour, 750 Main St. (at Westmorland Street).
From downtown, expect to pay around C$18 to reach either Magnetic
Hill or the airport. Cab companies include:

running Monday through Saturday 6:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. (extended to 
10:30 p.m. on Thurs and Fri). Buses run east along Main Street to a 
major interchange at Champlain Place, from where they head out in all

Staying in Moncton
As the hub of the Maritimes, Moncton can meet every lodging need and
budget. Accommodations are available all over the city, with the two main
concentrations being downtown and out on Route 2 near Magnetic Hill.
As in the rest of the Maritimes, July through August is high season in
Moncton — this is when lodging is in most demand and rates are highest.

population and, aside from in-house guests, is mostly the haunt of locals
in the know. The winsome menu combines the best cuts of beef with local
seafood — lobster-stuffed mushrooms to start, for example, and then rib-
eye with a side of garlic prawns. The wine cellar is one of the best in town.

Chapter 15: Moncton and the Acadian Coast 187

Exploring Moncton
Moncton’s location makes it a perfect base from which to explore the
region. It’s central to the beachy resort town of Shediac, the culturally
intriguing Acadian Coast (both covered later in this chapter), and the
Bay of Fundy (see Chapter 16).
The city itself features two interesting natural phenomena (maybe a
little less exciting than the tourist brochures claim, but interesting 
nevertheless), as well as a mix of museums and cultural pursuits.
Downtown
Bore View Park, home to the main visitor information center, is the best
starting point for exploring downtown. West of the park, Main Street has
been the focus of a rejuvenation program in recent years — red-brick
sidewalks, ornate benches, old-fashioned lampposts, and the like.
Bore View Park
Downtown
Twice daily, the Petitcodiac River drains dry of water as the huge Fundy
tide recedes; then the tide turns, literally, and water rushes up the mud-
died riverbed, led by a “wave” up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) high. The
river takes an hour to fill completely. The phenomenon is interesting
rather than exciting, but well worth watching. You can see the bore any-
where along the river (as well as many other places, including Truro in
central Nova Scotia), but Bore View Park is the most accessible and has
interpretive boards describing the how’s and why’s of the tide. Look 
for the clock at the park’s Main Street entrance to see when the bore is
next due.
Bore View Park is linked to the Riverfront Promenade, a wheelchair-acces-
sible walkway extending east to Hall’s Creek and west to the Gunningsville
Bridge, a total distance of 2km (1.2 miles). Take the path upstream to
quickly leave the city high-rises behind and be rewarded with panoramic
views across the river to undeveloped wetlands.
The park is also home to the Moncton Visitor Information Centre 
(% 800-363-4558 or 506-853-3540; open mid-May to early October daily 
9 a.m.–8 p.m., the rest of the year Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.).
See map p. 182. Main St. (at Lewis Street). Admission: Free.
Moncton Museum
Downtown
Housed in the former city hall, the Moncton Museum gives a good general
overview of local history. Its displays concentrate on the region’s first
inhabitants, the Mi’Kmaq First Nations people, as well as industries such
Part IV: New Brunswick 
188

as shipbuilding that have long since disappeared. The museum also hosts
several touring exhibits a year.
Beside the museum is the Free Meeting House, used by various religious
congregations. Dating to 1821, it’s Moncton’s oldest remaining building.
See map p. 182. 20 Mountain Rd. (at Belleview Street). % 506-856-4383. Admission:
Donation. Open: July–Aug daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; Sept–June Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m.,
Sun 1–5 p.m.
Musée Acadien
North of downtown
Founded by Father Camille Lefebvre in 1886, this museum focuses on his-
toric events and aspects of Acadian life. Over 35,000 pieces are on display,
making it Canada’s largest collection of Acadian culture. The oldest is an
ax dating to 1645, which was recovered from the site of a trading post
along the Acadian Coast. Of special historical importance is the original
Acadian flag; also of interest are the original register of donated pieces and
displays of Acadian art and religious sculptures. The museum is on the
sprawling grounds of Moncton University, well worth walking around in
summertime for the peaceful student-free setting.
See map p. 182. Clément-Cormier Building, Moncton University. % 506-858-4088.
Admission: C$2 adults, C$1 children. Open: July–Aug Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sat–Sun

Thomas Williams House
Downtown
Tucked away on a quiet residential street eight blocks from downtown is
a grand home built in 1883 for Thomas Williams, treasurer of the
Intercolonial Railway. Period furnishings and gardens reflect the Victorian
era. The house is worth visiting for afternoon tea alone, which is served on
the veranda. It’s not particularly traditional (coffee and muffins, by golly!),
but the parklike setting and unpretentious ambience lend to an enjoyable
time out from sightseeing.

Open: July–Aug Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 1–5 p.m.
Magnetic Hill
Take Exit 450 from Route 2 or follow Mountain Road northwest from
downtown to reach the Magnetic Hill area, a crunch of commercialism
that has grown around an optical oddity.
Upon arrival, you must first take care of business and pay C$3 per 
vehicle at the tollbooth. Continuing a short distance along a rural-type
stretch of road, signage directs you to come to a complete stop. Then,
when you take your foot off the brake, your vehicle seemingly rolls
uphill. The illusion is compelling: Basically, the entire lower hillside of 
Chapter 15: Moncton and the Acadian Coast 189

a larger mountain is tilted at an angle to the surrounding countryside,
creating the impression that the top of the hill is lower than the bottom.
It has puzzled folks for generations, including early farmers who were
forced to pull their wagons “down” the hill to town.
A magnet for commercial attractions
The magnetic appeal of Magnetic Hill extends well beyond one quirky
stretch of road. Many local entrepreneurs have set up theme-park style
businesses around the bottom (or is that the top?) of the hill. Here are
the highlights:
 Magic Mountain (% 506-857-9283) is the largest water park in the
Maritimes. Expect wild water rides, a wave pool, kid slides, and an
oversize hot tub. Admission is C$23 for everyone over 48 inches
high, with the exception being seniors aged 70 and older who pay
just C$7. It’s open mid-June through early September daily 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m.
 Magnetic Hill Zoo (% 506-877-7718) is home to around 100 species
of mostly exotic animals. It also has a small petting zoo of farm ani-
mals. Admission is C$9.50 adults, C$8.50 seniors, C$6.50 children.
It’s open mid-May through mid-October daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 The Boardwalk (% 506-852-9406) features go-cart rides, batting
cages, minigolf, a golf driving range, and butterflies flying freely in
their domed habitats. It’s open June through mid-September daily
10 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Nightlife
Despite its outwardly staid appearance, Moncton has a number of hap-
pening pubs and clubs. You can find entertainment listings through
Tourism Moncton (% 800-363-4558 or 506-853-3590; www.gomoncton.
com). This organization also publishes a list of annual festivals and
events.
Bars and live music
Le Galion, an elegant lounge in the Château Moncton at 100 Main St. 
(% 506-870-4444), is a pleasant place to unwind, with a bar that opens
to a deck overlooking the Petitcodiac River.
The stretch of Main Street between Botsford Street and Lutz Street has
an active nightlife, with crowds of college-aged drinkers spilling onto
sidewalk tables. Doc Dylan’s at 841 Main St. (% 506-382-3627) awaits,
with one of the best ranges of draft beer in town and bands on some
nights. A half-block off Main, the Pump House Brewery, 5 Orange Lane
(% 506-855-2337), brews a delicious range of beers, which can be
enjoyed indoors or out on a small porch with parking lot views. For
Part IV: New Brunswick 
190

something a little different, try the Blueberry Ale, which comes complete
with floating blueberries.
For live music, head to Club Cosmo, 700 Main St. (% 506-857-9117), a
multi-room venue that also attracts the under-25 crowd to Moncton’s
largest dance floor. The music is as hip as it gets in New Brunswick, 
with a crowd to match. Open Wednesday through Sunday only. Nearby
Ivory’s Piano Bar, at 706 Main St. (% 506-854-8679), is a little more 
subdued, while Oxygen, at 125 Westmorland St. (% 506-854-0265), 
is a groovy nightclub attracting more of the college-aged crowd.
The arts
The Capitol, at 811 Main St. (% 800-567-1922 or 506-856-4377), is an old
vaudeville house that has been devotedly restored to its 1920s grandeur,
right down to gold-leaf stenciling and renovated opera boxes. It provides
a home for Theatre New Brunswick and the Symphony New Brunswick,
as well as a stage for a wide range of touring acts. Check a schedule at
their Web site, www.capitol.nb.ca.
Acadian Coast
The French-flavored Acadian Coast stretches north from Moncton along
Northumberland Strait. Separating Prince Edward Island from the main-
land, this narrow waterway is lined along the New Brunswick side by
beaches galore, where shallow water warms quickly under the summer
sun. The center of beach culture is Shediac, although the place to get
away from the crowds is to the north in Kouchibouguac National Park.
Shediac
Beach lovers will feel right at home in laid-back Shediac. The coast here
borders Northumberland Strait, a shallow stretch of water between the
mainland and Prince Edward Island, where the water reaches a pleasant
22ºC (72ºF) in summer. So even when the Bay of Fundy is foggy, or the
water along the Nova Scotia coast is too cold for swimming, the stretch
of coast fronting Shediac sparkles in the sun. But don’t expect to have
the place to yourself through the warmest months of the year — the
town gets packed with college students on summer break and retirees
who can afford to kick back for a few months.
Getting there
From Moncton, follow Route 15 in a northeasterly direction for 20km 
(12 miles) to Exit 31B. Head north along Route 11 for a 400m (1⁄2 mile),
and then take Exit 1. This road leads past the main information center
and Shediac Harbour, and then along the long main street. The turnoff 
to Parlee Beach is through the town to the east.
Chapter 15: Moncton and the Acadian Coast 191

Staying in Shediac
Many of the accommodations near the water are rented by the week or
the month, making them impractical for the casual visitor. If hanging out
at the beach for a week fits into your schedule, Complexe Domaine
Parlee Beach, a short walk from the water at 642 Main St. (% 800-786-
5550 or 506-532-5339; www.complexedomaine.ca) is the place to do it.
Cottages rent for C$1,100 per week; suites are C$1,200 to C$1,450, with
daily rates from C$125 offered from early September through late June.

Expulsion, and then a cultural explosion
Most of the French-speaking population in the Maritimes today is Acadian, a culture
that differs from that of its better-known francophone cousin, Quebec, not only in his-
tory but in dialect, cuisine, and customs.
When the French began colonizing the Maritimes in the 1630s, most settled in the
Annapolis Valley, which came to be known as Acadia (and its settlers, hence, as
Acadians). In 1713, the British claimed sovereignty to Nova Scotia, and the Acadians
were encouraged to swear an oath of allegiance to England. Most refused, and in 1755
the British reacted by confiscating their property and expelling them. With no place to
call home, the Acadians scattered — some returned to France, others moved west to
Quebec, and some settled in Louisiana (where they became known as Cajuns); a small
percentage escaped into the remote forests of what is now New Brunswick and to
the far corners of Prince Edward Island.
A decade after their expulsion, many who had been exiled came out of hiding and
returned to the region. They resettled and built new communities as far from the British
as possible. In 1884, at an Acadian convention held in Miscouche, Prince Edward
Island, these once displaced people officially adopted their own flag and anthem (“Ave
Maris Stella”) — the seeds of a distinct and unique culture that thrives to this day.
New Brunswick, Canada’s only bilingual province, has a large Acadian population cen-
tered in Moncton and stretching up the coast. Acadian heritage and traditions remain
strong, and visitors are offered many opportunities to experience it firsthand through
museums, historical reenactments, and, of course, the food!

Dining in Shediac
You can enjoy lobsters at most restaurants along the main street, or buy
them live or cooked from Shediac Lobster Shop, a seafood market at 261
Main St. (% 506-532-4302). Expect to pay around C$15 per pound.

This boisterous restaurant/bar is away from the best beaches but attracts
hordes of tanned bods for fresh seafood, cold beer, and live music Tuesday
to Sunday throughout the summer. The food is exactly what you’d expect
from a seafood house, with prices that may pleasantly surprise you: For
example, the substantial three-piece fish-and-chips entree comes with
freshly made tartar sauce for C$11. The lobster bisque and maritime chow-
der are also both under C$10. Take a table either downstairs, upstairs 
on the tiered deck — with views across to the marina — or in the Lobster
Hut, where you can order full lobster, chowder, coleslaw, and dessert for
just C$32.

Cool things to do in and around Shediac
Don’t come to Shediac looking for cultural stimulation. This is a place to
lie on the beach, swim in the warmest ocean water north of Virginia, and
feast on lobster.
The swimming season is short — July and August only. Parlee Beach,
accessed from the east side of town, is by far the most popular spot for
sunning and swimming. A large complex behind the dunes holds change
rooms, a concession, and a lively bar/restaurant with a huge deck. Mid-
May through mid-September, beach access costs C$9 per vehicle (it’s
free the rest of the year). Farther east, Ocean View Beach and Gagnon
Beach are quieter and just as pleasant.
When you’ve had enough sun, sand, and salt, consider the following:
 Go lobster fishing. With Eric LeBlanc at the helm, Shediac Bay
Cruises (% 888-894-2002 or 506-532-2175; www.lobstertales.ca)
takes visitors on a 21⁄2-hour fishing trip that culminates in an on-
board lobster feast. The cost is C$55 adults, C$35 children. From
the Reception Centre at Pointe-du-Chene Wharf, departures are
daily between late April and early November.
 Drive to Cape Jourimain. The easternmost point of New Brunswick,
80km (50 miles) east of Shediac, is protected by a national wildlife
area that is home to 170 species of birds. A 13km (8-mile) system 
of hiking trails branches out from Cape Jourimain Nature Centre
(% 506-538-2220; open mid-May through early Oct daily 9 a.m.–
5 p.m.). One trail ends at the cape itself, where views extend north
Chapter 15: Moncton and the Acadian Coast 193

along the Confederation Bridge. Admission is C$6 adults, C$5 sen-
iors, C$4 children.
 Climb on the world’s largest lobster. This 10m-long (33-foot) cast-
iron crustacean stands guard at the mouth of the Scoudouc River,
at the west entrance to town. Kids love clambering over its massive
claws, while adults are usually content with a photograph.
 Enjoy the Shediac Lobster Festival. Held over five days in early
July, this annual festival celebrates everything related to Shediac’s
favorite feast, including nightly lobster suppers and a lobster-
eating contest. For details call % 506-532-1122 or visit www.

Bouctouche and beyond
Imagine spending the morning exploring a seemingly endless sand dune,
followed by an afternoon immersing yourself in Acadian culture in a
make-believe island village. You can do this at Bouctouche, a small
coastal town 20km (12 miles) north of Shediac along Route 11.
Staying in Bouctouche
Accommodations in Bouctouche are limited. If the recommendation here
doesn’t sound like your scene, continue north to the Acadian Peninsula,
or plan on visiting the region as a day trip from Moncton.

five-minute drive from La Dune de Bouctouche, so you can rise early and

Exploring Bouctouche
It may not be much more than a lot of sand, but La Dune de Bouctouche
is one of the natural highlights of New Brunswick. It’s an extremely
narrow spit of sand, extending 12km (71⁄2 miles) into Northumberland
Strait. Plant life, such as beach heather, has a stabilizing effect, but tidal
action and wind still manage to move the sand around, ever so slowly
extending the spit while also making it narrower. To learn more about
the unique ecosystem, stop by Irving Eco Centre, along Route 475 at the
start of the spit (% 506-743-2600; open July–Aug 10 a.m.–8 p.m.). To
protect the fragile environment from overuse in the busiest months (July
Part IV: New Brunswick 
194

and Aug), only the first 2,000 visitors to arrive each day after 10 a.m. are
allowed access. A boardwalk extends for the first 2km (11⁄4 miles); to con-
tinue farther, walk along the high tide mark.
Located on a small island in the Bouctouche River, Le Pays de la
Sagouine, accessed by footbridge from Acadie Street (% 800-561-9188
or 506-743-1400; www.sagouine.com), is a fun place to immerse yourself
in the rich culture of Acadia. Part theme park, part learning experience,
it centers on a fictional Acadian village created by writer Antonine
Maillet. Costumed performers put on musical and theatrical presenta-
tions throughout the day. Storytelling neighbors, young pranksters, and
Acadian bands encouraging singalongs are just a taste of what you can
expect. Admission is C$15 adults, C$14 seniors, C$11 children. On
Saturday and Sunday nights in July and August, Pelagie-la-Charrette, a
magnificent dinner theater featuring up to 70 actors, costs C$69 for
adults and C$48 for children. Tuesday through Friday a variety of less
ambitious dinner theater productions are C$69 adults and C$45 children,
which includes general park admission.
Kouchibouguac National Park
Although the entire Acadian Coast offers similar coastal scenery, the
section between Bouctouche and Miramichi is particularly appealing
because it’s protected as a national park and, therefore, remains in its
natural state. Kouchibouguac (pronounced Koo-she-boo-gwack), mean-
ing “river of long tides,” is dominated by a ribbon of barrier islands com-
posed entirely of sand. Extending for 25km (16 miles), these islands have
formed lagoons that attract a wide variety of bird life (over 200 bird
species have been recorded in the park). The rest of the park is a mix of
forest, slow-flowing rivers, peat bogs, and marshland. Deer, moose, black
bears, and beavers are all residents, while you can often spot seals in
the surrounding waters.
To experience the best of Kouchibouguac, explore beyond the paved
roads. Here’s how:
 Hiking. This isn’t the place for grueling all-day hikes. Instead, visi-
tors have a choice of short trails, many lined with interpretive
panels describing the surroundings. If you take just one trail, make
it Kelly’s Beach Boardwalk, which crosses a lagoon to sand dunes
and open water. Don’t be perturbed by the name of the Bog Trail —
a boardwalk leads through the marshland.
 Biking. You can find a 60km (37-mile) system of crushed-gravel bike
trails. The main loop — taking in the river, the forested interior, and
the coast — is 23km (14 miles). Complete the circuit in two hours,
or spend all day stopping at its points of interest. Bikes can be
rented at Ryans Recreation Equipment Rental Centre, based at
Ryans day-use area (% 506-876-8918), for C$6 per hour or C$30
per day.
Chapter 15: Moncton and the Acadian Coast 195

 Canoeing. If you are comfortable out on the water on your own,
canoes can be rented from Ryan’s (see earlier), which is beside the
calm waters of the Kouchibouguac River. Just as enjoyable is join-
ing park staff on a three-hour guided paddle in a large voyageur
canoe, which seats up to nine people. The cost is C$30 per person.
Reserve a seat at the visitor center (% 506-876-2443).
 Swimming. The water on the ocean side of the dunes at Kelly’s
Beach is supervised throughout the summer. Although the water
temperature is comfortable, it’s even warmer to the south at
Callender’s Beach, along a tidal lagoon.
Get to the park by taking Exit 75 from Route 11, 35km (21 miles) north 
of Bouctouche. Just inside the park boundary is the Visitor Reception
Centre (% 506-876-2443), holding displays on the park ecosystem and
including a small theater, a gift shop, and an information desk. This is
also the place to pick up a park day pass, which costs C$6.90 adults,
C$5.90 seniors, C$3.45 children, to a maximum of C$17 per vehicle. The
center is open mid-June through early September daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
with extended hours in July and August of 8 a.m. to 8 p.m daily. Access
to the park is possible year-round, but everything closes down in
September, and the entry fee isn’t collected out of season.
Check the bulletin board at the visitor center for a schedule of events,
which may include interpretive hikes, campfire talks, slide presenta-
tions, and a puppet theater.
Acadian Peninsula
Extending northeast from Miramichi along Baie des Chaleurs, the
Acadian peninsula is a hotbed of Acadian culture. You can experience
this unique culture by exploring local museums, sampling the cuisine, or
simply taking a drive through the many small villages where traditions
run deep.
At Miramichi, you have two options for onward travel: Either cut south
through the heartland of New Brunswick to Fredericton, or follow Route
11 around the Acadian Peninsula, which is dotted with farms and fishing
villages.
Staying on the Acadian Peninsula
Use Miramichi as a base for a day trip around the Acadian Peninsula, or
push on and spend the night at the recommended accommodations in
Caraquet (the region’s largest town) or Miscou Centre.

on the covered veranda, look across to the river, and imagine yourself
transported back in time. Formerly the home of a provincial lieutenant
governor, this stately 1860 mansion has been given a bright yellow coat of
paint on the outside and undergone a rigorous restoration inside. Rooms
are divided between the main home and the adjacent Beaubear Manor.
Antiques and convivial hosts make up for slightly threadbare furnishings.
Some rooms share bathrooms (the Eagles Eyrie, with water views, is the
pick of these), but at just C$79 for the most expensive (the Lord
Beaverbrook Room, which comes complete with a four-piece bath and fire-
place), you can afford to splurge. Within sight of the inn is Beaubears

12 guest rooms have been given a serious overhaul and feature a contem-

rooms. The four top-floor suites are massive and come with upgraded
everything. In the evening, guests congregate in a lounge, where local
musicians occasionally stop by to play the piano.

available), volleyball, minigolf, horseshoes, and more. The six cabins each
have two bedrooms and a fully equipped kitchen, making them excellent

Dining on the Acadian Peninsula
Most villages have a choice of cafes or restaurants, and you may con-
sider taking a chance at any of them. I recommend two very different
restaurants that showcase the charm of the region in their own unique
ways. As alternatives, the Hotel Paulin or Rodd Miramichi River (earlier
in this chapter I recommend both as places to stay) have dining rooms
worthy of a visit.

Translating to “fine grub by the sea,” this fine restaurant provides some

relying on local seafood and produce from the garden to create a memo-
rable meal. The super-smooth lobster bisque and herb-crusted leg of lamb
are both noteworthy. For dessert, the cheese plate is tempting, but, seri-
ously, can you choose anything but the chocolate cake?

Exploring the Acadian Peninsula
To fully appreciate the peninsula’s natural and cultural appeal, plan on
spending at least a day in the region. Visiting the following two top
Acadian attractions alone will fill the better part of a day.
Route 11 parallels the Gulf of St. Lawrence all the way from Miramichi to
Bathurst, a total distance of 170km (106 miles). From Bathurst, it’s a
short hop back across the peninsula to Miramichi.

Village Historique Acadien
Route 11 west of Caraquet
Definitely a highlight of the Acadian Coast, this park re-creates Acadian life
between 1770 and 1890. The 40 restored buildings include simple homes, a
chapel, a farmyard, a schoolhouse, various workshops, a lobster hatchery,
and a tavern. Costumed staff bring the village to life as they go about their
daily business — tending to their animals, overseeing auctions, spreading
gossip, attending marriages, and more. Visitors can also watch as artists
ply their trade, or dine on Acadian food in one of two restaurants.

Acadian Museum
Caraquet
Founded by Acadians fleeing the British in 1755, the village of Caraquet
has evolved into the unofficial center of the peninsula’s French-speaking
community. This small museum does a wonderful job of representing the
town and its residents, many of whom have donated items to display.
Taking in the water view from the second floor balcony is worthwhile.

Newcastle
Now incorporated as part of Miramichi, this bustling river town is more
attractive than at first glance. Make your way down to Ritchie Wharf Park
(Leddon Street) and let the children go wild on the maritime-themed play-
ground and splash park; take lunch at one of the cafes; and learn more
about the region at the riverside information center.
In the heart of downtown is a memorial to Lord Beaverbrook (1879–1964),
a British press baron who spent his childhood in Newcastle. His boyhood
home, at 518 King George Hwy., is a few blocks west of the memorial 
(% 504-622-5572). It’s open to the public June to August Monday to Friday
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is free.

Saint John and the 
Fundy Coast
In This Chapter
 Getting to Saint John and finding your way around the city
 Deciding where to stay and dine
 Seeing the sights and spending a night on the town
 Visiting St. Andrews and exploring Fundy National Park
S
aint John is a gritty industrial city with a striking waterfront enhanced
by the Harbour Passage, a municipal beautification project. With a
population of 120,000, Greater Saint John is New Brunswick’s largest city
and offers all the benefits of big-city life — like upscale accommodations
and creative dining — at affordable small-town prices.
Established in 1785 by Loyalists (American colonists who wished to
remain loyal to the British crown after the birth of the United States),
Saint John was Canada’s first incorporated city, prospering as a port and
shipbuilding center. In 1877, a fire destroyed almost the entire down-
town, which was then rebuilt with fine brick and stone buildings, most 
of which remain today.
Saint John is always spelled out. It is never abbreviated to “St. John,”
thereby avoiding confusion with St. John’s, Newfoundland.
Saint John may be the biggest name on the map, but in this chapter I
give you plenty of reasons to explore the rest of the Fundy Coast. Take
Route 1 west from Saint John to reach St. Andrews, a one-time retreat for
the wealthy that now welcomes everyone. Up the Bay of Fundy from
Saint John, a rugged section of the coast is protected by Fundy National
Park. Beyond the park is Hopewell Rocks, intriguing towers of sandstone
that have become separated from the mainland.

Getting To Saint John
Most travelers arrive in Saint John by road, but options include flying in
or coming from Nova Scotia by ferry.
By plane
Saint John Airport (www.saintjohnairport.com) is along Route 111
toward St. Martins, 16km (10 miles) east of downtown. Air Canada flies
into Saint John from Halifax, Toronto, and Montreal. WestJet links Saint
John with Toronto. Rental car companies with desks at the airport are
Avis, Budget, Hertz, and National.
The least expensive way to travel between the airport and downtown is
on a Saint John Transit bus (% 506-658-4700). The service departs the
airport four times daily and costs C$2.25, exact change only. The cab
fare between the airport and downtown is C$30 for the first person, and
C$2 for each additional person.
All passengers departing Saint John Airport are required to pay a
Passenger Facility Fee of C$15. The fee is incorporated into the price 
of your airline ticket.
By car
The most direct route between Moncton and Saint John is Route 1, a dis-
tance of 155km (96 miles) that takes about 90 minutes to drive. A more
scenic option is Route 114 along the Bay of Fundy, which passes two of
New Brunswick’s most appealing natural attractions — Hopewell Rocks
and Fundy National Park. Taking this route doubles the driving time.
The provincial capital of New Brunswick, Fredericton, is 105km (65 miles)
north of Saint John via Route 7. If you’re willing to do a longer course
with scenic appeal, take Route 102 via Gagetown.
By ferry
If you’re visiting both southwestern Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, it
makes sense to take advantage of the ferry service between Digby and
Saint John. Bay Ferries (% 888-249-7245 or 506-649-7777; www.nfl-bay.
com) runs this passage year-round, up to three times daily in each direc-
tion. The one-way fare is C$30 to C$40 adults, C$25 to C$30 seniors, C$20
to C$25 children ages 5 to 17, and C$75 to C$80 for vehicles under 6.4m
(21 feet). Reservations for the three-hour trip are highly recommended
in summer.

from Route 1 leads right into the heart of downtown. Immediately west,
Route 1 crosses the Saint John River via the Harbour Bridge (C25¢ toll)
and heads out toward Irving Nature Park.
Ferries from Digby arrive in Saint John West, from where signage directs
you to Exit 120 of Route 1. From this point, head east over the Harbour
Bridge to downtown.
Note that many streets of Saint John West have the same names as those
downtown. To avoid confusion, they are designated as “West,” as in
Church St. W.
Parking
To park downtown, take Exit 122 from Route 1 and then turn down the
first street to the right to have a choice of outside parking for C$1 per
hour, or slightly more for underground parking.
Grabbing a cab
You can hail a cab anywhere downtown, but if you have trouble, walk
through the Market Square and wait for one at the Saint John Hilton.
Local companies include:
 Century Taxi (% 506-696-6969)
 Coastal Taxi (% 506-635-1144)
 Diamond Taxi (% 506-648-8888)
Taking transit
Saint John Transit (% 506-658-4700) is a highly efficient bus system
that operates along 22 routes to all corners of the city, including out to
the airport. Many buses run at ten-minute intervals from the main down-
town pickup point at King’s Square. The fare is C$2.25 for adults, C$2 for
seniors and children, exact change only.
Staying in Saint John
Saint John has a number of historic inns, the best of which are within
walking distance of downtown. Concentrations of mid-priced chain
motels lie along Route 1 east and west of the city.
A string of cheap motels is spread along Manawagonish Road, west of
downtown. Among the least expensive is the Island View Motel, 1726
Manawagonish Rd. (% 888-674-6717 or 506-672-1381; www.islandview
motel.ca), which comes with water views and a small outdoor pool.
Rates are C$75 to C$85, which puts it at the lower end of the $$ price 
category.

This large and luxurious bed-and-breakfast lies on a high ridge overlook-
ing the harbor and is within walking distance of downtown via the Harbour
Passage promenade. The creation of the inn, a subtle amalgamation of two
side-by-side mansions built for shipbuilding brothers, was a labor of love
for owners Ralph and Karen Holyoke. The inn is full of appropriate
antiques sourced by Ralph throughout the Maritimes; big windows, high
ceilings, and ornate furnishings add to the grandeur. The ten guest rooms
are all very different, but each is outfitted with a large bathroom. The
Veranda Room (C$140) is my favorite. The centerpiece of this unit is an
1850s walnut bed, while the adjacent sitting area has views across to Saint
John Harbour. The parlor is a popular place to relax, especially in the after-
noon when refreshments are laid out. A big breakfast gets you going each
morning.

has a wonderfully carefree feeling about it. The perfect way to follow up a

In Saint John, many of the better restaurants are tucked away and easy

waterfront, where a string of restaurants take full advantage of summer
warmth by setting out tables along a cobbled plaza.

are all good. In the evening, the curry of the day is a local favorite (as is the
accompanying freshly made mango chutney), but my last visit coincided
with a delivery of spring lamb from a local farm, so choosing anything else
wasn’t even an issue.

$$–$$$$
Downtown
SEAFOOD
Tucked away at the back of the Saint John City Market, Billy’s enjoys a stel-
lar reputation for fresher-than-fresh seafood, which can also be bought
market-style at the front counter. The restaurant itself is a sleek, old-
fashioned room with comfortable booths, dim lighting, and lots of dark
polished wood. You can start by sharing steamed mussels and crab cakes
with mango dipping sauce, and then move on to cedar plank salmon,
broiled halibut in blueberry balsamic sauce, or a full lobster from the tank.
The wine list complements the food well but is a bit expensive. Lunchtime
is a good time to try the lobster roll, packed with a combination of the deli-
cious meat and mayonnaise (C$14).

Church Street Steak House

STEAK
Saint John is a long way from the rangelands of Alberta, but this popular
steakhouse does an excellent job of sourcing the best cuts of beef and
cooking them exactly as you ordered them. The appetizers are mostly
seafood-oriented, a perfect complement to a beef entree. The setting is a
historic red-brick building that remains virtually unchanged in appearance
since it was built following the 1877 fire that destroyed most of downtown.

Grannan’s
$$–$$$$
Downtown
SEAFOOD
My favorite of the many Market Square restaurants. Grannan’s has lots of
outdoor seating, but the interior is also appealing, with a stylish mix of
maritime-themed artifacts, including brass ship lamps and an antique
diving suit. A blackboard menu is the place to search out seasonal seafood,
but you won’t go wrong with a pick from the Features section of the regu-
lar menu (my seafood casserole was delicious). For a splurge, consider the
Seafood Brochette, a lobster tail with skewered scallops and shrimp
sautéed at your table.

Exploring Saint John
Earlier, this chapter discusses your accommodations and dining options.
Here I get into the real reason for spending time in Saint John — to soak
up the sights, sounds, and smells of a port city that has changed little in
appearance in over a century.
All of the attractions discussed in this section (except Carleton Martello
Tower) are within walking distance of each other. Pick up the Three
Historic Walking Tours brochure (free) from the information center to
learn more about the most notable buildings as you explore downtown.
Barbour’s General Store
Downtown
This late-1800s shop is preserved as a museum, its shelves stocked with
merchandise sold a century ago, like candy and tobacco.

to early Sept daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.
Carleton Martello Tower
Saint John West
Built in 1812 to protect the then-fledgling Loyalist city of Saint John from
attack, the tower is similar in design to circular towers built along the
British coastline during the Napoleonic Wars. Over the years, this solid
stone structure has also been used for ammunition storage, as a soldiers’
barracks, as a detention center for deserters, and as an anti-aircraft posi-
tion. Today, protected as a National Historic Site, it’s all tourist attraction.

Fort Howe Lookout
North of Downtown
The best place to get a feel for the layout of Saint John is Fort Howe
Lookout, a two-minute drive north of downtown, off Main Street. The
Loyalists established a fort here in 1778 to defend their new settlement
against attack by Americans. Looking out to the mouth of the harbor,
which affords unobstructed views of incoming vessels, the reason they
chose this lofty location is clear.
Magazine Street off Main Street.
King’s Square
Downtown
From the waterfront, take a steep walk up King Street to reach King’s
Square, which was laid out in the shape of a Union Jack to reflect the loy-
alty to the British monarchy held by those who escaped the American
Revolution to settle in Saint John. The most intriguing of numerous mon-
uments is a lump of melted metal salvaged from a hardware store that was
destroyed by the fire that raced through downtown in 1877.
Across Sydney Street from King’s Square are a couple of other historical
diversions. Inside the 1829 County Courthouse, at King and Sydney streets,
is a massive spiral staircase built of unsupported stones. Across King
Street is the Loyalist’s Old Burial Ground, the final resting place of the
city’s founding fathers.
See map p. 203. At King and Charlotte streets.
Loyalist House
Downtown
Dating to 1817, this Georgian-style Loyalist House is Saint John’s oldest
building and is well worth visiting. Lived in by six generations of the same
family, it is furnished with authentic Georgian antiques and has a total of

Walking the walk
Harbour Passage, along Saint John’s downtown foreshore, is an ambitious project
that will eventually see the entire waterfront area linked by pathways and dotted with
green space, benches, and interpretive panels that extend all the way to Reversing
Falls. At this stage, the 2.7km (1.7-mile) paved trail extends around the harbor from the
Hilton Saint John to Reversing Falls. Along the way it passes by the Gathering Garden,
planted with the same species used by native peoples long ago; the site of a 1600s
Acadian fort; a pavilion with sweeping city views; and a power substation with inter-
pretive panels describing what goes on behind the wire fence.

New Brunswick Museum
Downtown
One of the largest museums in the Maritimes, this modern facility is part
of the Market Square complex down on the harborfront. Every gallery has
something different and interesting: The Shipbuilding Gallery catalogs the
city’s first industry, the Hall of Great Whales is dominated by a full-size
right whale skeleton, the Birds of New Brunswick Gallery features displays
describing some of the province’s 370 recorded species, and the Discovery
Gallery is filled with kid-friendly learning experiences.

9 p.m.), Sun noon to 5 p.m.; closed Mon Nov–Apr.
Saint John City Market
Downtown
The 1876 City Market, the oldest in Canada, occupies a full block between
Charlotte and Germain streets. The handsome building was designed by
local shipbuilders, whose influence is obvious when you look up at the
inverted-keel ceiling. The collection of stalls is varied — an old-fashioned
butcher, produce, fresh seafood, and touristy knickknacks. Instead of
eating at the unappealing food court along one side, choose some cheeses
from the dairy bar, some smoked salmon and a cooked lobster from the
seafood counter, and some crusty rolls from the bakery and then head out
to Irving Nature Park for a picnic lunch.
See map p. 203. 47 Charlotte St. % 506-658-2820. Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Thurs
7:30 a.m.–6 p.m., Fri 7:30 a.m.–7 p.m., Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Other cool things to see and do
After you finish exploring downtown, expand your horizons and con-
sider the following attractions.
Reversing Falls
Another Fundy phenomenon, this is Saint John’s most hyped natural
attraction. As the massive Fundy tide rises, the flow of the Saint John
River reverses as ocean water pushes upstream. When the tide recedes,
the water flows in the opposite direction. The “falls” are a series of rock
ledges at the base of a narrow gorge, which form rapids where the water
tumbles in opposite directions just before and after low tide. You really
need to visit at both high and low tides to appreciate the difference in
water level — 4.4m (15 feet).
Part IV: New Brunswick 
210

To get to Reversing Falls from downtown, cross Route 1 via Main Street
and take Chesley Drive off to the left. You can also get there by taking
Exit 119 from Route 1 and turning right onto Bridge Road.
Overlooking the gorge is the Reversing Falls Visitor Centre, part of 
a restaurant complex at 200 Bridge Rd. (% 506-658-2937). Displays
describe the effect of the tides, out back is an observation platform, and
you can watch a film about the falls (C$2.50). The center is open from mid-
May through early October, daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Or cross to Fallsview
Park, on the east side of the gorge. Access is via Douglas Avenue.
Boats can navigate the gorge safely, but only when the tide reaches a
certain level and the current slows. The only people who avoid this
“slack” tide are folks at F1 Reversing Falls Jet Boat Rides (% 888-
634-8987 or 506-634-8987), who wait until the rapids are at their roughest
to take you out for a 20-minute ride through the churning water. The cost
is C$34 adults, C$27 children. The departure point is Fallsview Park. The
same company runs a regular one-hour boat tour through the gorge and
around the harbor for C$34 adults, C$27 children. These trips depart
from downtown’s Market Square to coincide with calm slack tide.
Rockwood Park
The Maritime’s largest urban park (810 hectares/2,000 acres) encom-
passes native forests and numerous lakes northeast of downtown Saint
John. Everyone can find plenty to do, including:
 Monkey around at Cherry Brook Zoo, Foster Thurston Road 
(% 506-634-1440), where you can see lions, tigers, and over 30
other exotic species. It’s open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and admission is
C$8 adults, C$7 seniors, and C$6 children.
 Take a hike along 25km (15.5 miles) of pathways. One popular trail
begins from Lake Drive South and encircles pretty Crystal Lake.
 Aim for the water hazard at Rockwood Park Golf Course, on
Sandy Point Road (% 506-634-0090), which has the Maritimes’
only aquatic driving range. Greens fees are C$35.
 Swim and splash in one of the park’s 12 lakes. Fisher Lakes, off
Lake Drive South, has supervised swimming, canoe rentals, and a
sandy stretch of beach.
The easiest way to get to Rockwood Park is to take Foster Thurston Drive
north from Exit 128 of Route 1, 3km (2 miles) east of downtown. This road
leads all the way around the park. If you’re feeling confident in your route-
finding ability, cross Route 1 via Somerset Street and hook a right on
Churchill Boulevard. For park information, dial % 506-658-2883.
Irving Nature Park
A rocky peninsula jutting into busy Saint John Harbour has escaped
development and is protected as Irving Nature Park. This 243-hectare
Chapter 16: Saint John and the Fundy Coast 211

(600-acre) park has a sandy stretch of beach near the entrance, rocky
coves, pleasant hiking trails, and tidal pools filled with colorful critters.
At the park’s highest point, reached along the Squirrel Trail, an obser-
vation tower offers sweeping views back across the mud flats linking the
peninsula to the mainland. Between early June and late October the park
becomes home to hundreds of seals, which haul themselves out of the
water and onto the rocky shoreline. Bird life is prolific year-round —
over 200 species have been recorded in the park.
Irving Nature Park is west of downtown. To get there, take Exit 119 from
Route 1 and follow Bleury Street and then Sand Cove Road into the park.
Cross the mud flats to reach an information booth that is staffed late
May through October. For park information, call % 506-653-7367.
Admission is free.
Nightlife
If you feel like enjoying a tipple and some local music but want to avoid
the hard-drinking, dimly lit downtown bars, you have plenty of options.
Stop by either of the city information centers for a schedule of what’s
on, or check with Tourism Saint John (% 866-463-8639 or 506-658-2855;
www.tourismsaintjohn.com) directly.
Pubs and clubs
All the restaurants in Market Square, including Grannan’s (% 506-634-
1555), have a section of the public plaza cordoned off for outdoor seating.
You’re welcome to stop by for just a refreshing drink in the sun at any of
these places. Also here is Saint John Ale House (% 506-657-2337), with
British-style beers on tap and a full menu. In the vicinity, the Brigantine
Lounge in the Hilton Saint John at 1 Market Square (% 506-693-8484) has
unobstructed harbor views from its outdoor patio.
The Trinity Royal area, up King and Princess streets, is a good place 
to look for local color and live music. O’Leary’s Pub, 46 Princess St. 
(% 506-634-7135), is a jumping Irish pub, with Guinness on tap and
Celtic bands most nights. Tapps Brew Pub, 78 King St. (% 506-634-
1957), attracts an older crowd.
The arts
The Imperial Theatre on King’s Square (% 506-674-4100) is a meticu-
lously restored 1913 vaudeville theater. It’s home to local theater, opera,
ballet, and music productions, with programs that usually run from
September through to April. Theater tours are available in summer
Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. for C$2 per person.

Fundy Coast
Beyond Saint John, you can head west to the resort town of St. Andrews,
back toward Moncton via Fundy National Park, or inland to the provin-
cial capital of Fredericton. The following sections detail the first two
options, while I cover Fredericton in Chapter 17.
Fundy National Park
The massive Fundy tides are the most dramatic aspect of this popular
coastal park northeast of Saint John, but the rugged interior dotted with
lakes along with the network of hiking trails brings in the summertime
crowds. The park even has a covered bridge, which lies near the end of
Point Wolfe Road.
Wildlife is prolific on the land, in the air, and out in the Bay of Fundy. At
dawn or dusk you have an excellent chance of spying moose, beavers, or
black bears, while bird-watchers delight in spotting peregrine falcons.
Getting there
You need a vehicle to reach Fundy National Park. It’s bisected by 
Route 114, which branches off Route 1 84km (51 miles) northeast of
Saint John. From this junction, it’s 25km (16 miles) to the park gate and 
a farther 17km (11 miles) to the main facility area.
Park entry fees
The daily entry fee to Fundy National Park is C$6.90 adults, C$5.90 sen-
iors, C$3.45 children, to a maximum of C$17 per vehicle. Fees are col-
lected at booths located at both park entrances.
Gathering more information
The Visitor Reception Centre (% 506-887-6000; www.pc.gc.ca) is just
inside the east park gate. It’s open mid-June through August daily 8 a.m.
to 10 p.m. and from mid-May to mid-June and September to mid-October
daily 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
If you’re coming in from the west, make a stop at the Wolfe Lake Visitor
Centre, open mid-June through mid-August daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Staying in Fundy National Park
Most people staying in Fundy camp out in one of four park campgrounds.
Campsites and indoor accommodations are limited, so reserve as far in
advance as possible.

Dining in Fundy National Park
The park has just one restaurant, but as both accommodations have
cooking facilities, preparing your own meal is an easy option. In adjacent
Alma, Butland’s Seafood on Main Street (% 506-887-2190) sells cooked
lobsters for around C$12 per pound, with the price clearly displayed in
black marker on their claws. You can also buy fresh shrimp, mussels,
scallops, and a variety of fish.

This restaurant is exactly what you’d expect in the popular park — family-
friendly and informal, with well-priced, unfussy food. Three massive chan-
deliers, a large stone fireplace, and a 6-kilogram (14-pound) lobster shell
dominate the main dining room. The menu is short and simple, ranging from
a traditional roast beef dinner to sautéed scallops. All children’s dishes are
under C$6.

Exploring Fundy National Park
The main facility area, just inside the east gate, is a good place to get 
oriented. Stop by the visitor center for a park map and hiking trail
Part IV: New Brunswick

description brochure, and then wander down to the water’s edge for
panoramic views across the Bay of Fundy.
Hiking
Within the park are 120km (74.6 miles) of hiking trails designed for all 
fitness levels. Head to either visitor center for a trail map and to ask
advice about which trails would suit your fitness level and interests.
At low tide, you can walk along the beach below the main visitor center,
but don’t expect to have it to yourself. To escape the crowds, drive west
along Point Wolfe Road From the end of this road, a 0.6km (0.4-mile)
path leads through a lush spruce forest to Point Wolfe Beach at the
braided mouth of the Point Wolfe River. From the same trail head, the
Coppermine Trail leads 2.3km (1.4 miles) farther west along the coast
to the site of an abandoned mine. Allow two hours for the round-trip.
Backtrack along Point Wolfe Road and then take Herring Cove Road to
reach Herring Cove Trail, a 15-minute jaunt down to a rocky cove with a
tidal cave off to one side. From the cove, the Matthews Head Trail leads
off to the south, traversing to a high headland with stunning ocean
views. Allow 90 minutes for this 4.5km (2.8-mile) circuit.
An easy introduction to the park’s interior forest is the Caribou Plain
Trail, a 3.4km (2.1-mile) circuit that loops around a beaver pond. The
trail head is just east of Bennett Lake. Third Vault Falls tumbles over a
16m-high (53-foot) ledge in the eastern portion of the park. The falls are
reached via a 3.7km (2.3-mile) trail that braches off Laverty Road. Allow
60 to 70 minutes each way.
Other things to do and see in Fundy National Park
Hiking is the major attention-getter in the park, but you can also do the
following:
 Swim. A unique saltwater pool is filled with water pumped up from
the Bay of Fundy and then heated to a comfortable temperature.
Entry is C$3.45 adults, C$2.95 seniors, C$1.90 children. It’s open
July through August, daily 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 Golf. The fairways of a short nine-hole golf course wind their way
along Dickson Brook, beside the main facility area. A pro shop 
(% 506-887-2970) rents clubs and collects greens fees of C$1780,
or golf all day for C$32.
 Paddle. Rent a canoe (C$9 per hour) at Bennett Lake, halfway
along the park road, to explore the shoreline of this tranquil body
of water.
 Watch the tide. Okay, watching tidal movements is not very excit-
ing, but at low tide, Alma Harbour is devoid of water, leaving fish-
ing boats high and dry on the ocean floor.
Chapter 16: Saint John and the Fundy Coast 215

Hopewell Cape
Around halfway between Fundy National Park and Moncton, Route 114
rounds Hopewell Cape. Turn here to reach Hopewell Rocks, a cluster of
rock towers that were once part of the mainland but became separated
by erosion caused by the tides. Known as “flower pots” (many have
trees and shrubbery growing on top), they’re partly covered at high tide,
but when the massive Fundy tide recedes, they rise starkly from the
muddy shoreline.
Plan on arriving one to three hours before low tide. Tidal charts are pub-
lished in all local newspapers and are available at information centers.
The visitor’s guide to Fundy National Park (you get one at the park
entrance) has a tide chart on the center page.
Staying and dining at Hopewell Cape
Most visitors to Hopewell Rocks spend two to four hours poking around
and then move on to Moncton or Fundy National Park. Alternatively, you
can stay overnight at the Hopewell Rocks Motel & Country Inn, within
walking distance of the attraction.
Hopewell Rocks Motel
$$
Hopewell Cape
Located at the entrance to Hopewell Rocks, this adequate motel has large
air-conditioned rooms and a small outdoor pool. The hanging baskets of
colorful flowers out front are a nice touch. Rooms 11 through 20 face away
from the road and are quieter. Summer rates include a pancake breakfast.
Ignore your hunger pangs down at Hopewell Rocks and plan on taking a
meal back out on the highway at this motel’s Log Cabin Restaurant. The
lobster dinner is well priced; or choose one of the daily specials, which
are discounted from the main menu. The dining room is open May through
October, daily 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.

Exploring Hopewell Rocks
At the end of the access road off Route 114 are a massive parking lot and
a fee station where the entry charge is collected. Admission is C$8 adults,
C$6.75 seniors, C$5.75 children.
The gates are open mid-May to mid-June daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., mid-June
to mid-August daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., mid- to late August daily 8 a.m. to 
6 p.m., September to mid-October 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and are closed the
rest of the year.
Beyond the fee station, make your way down to the large Interpretive
Centre (% 506-734-3552). This is a good place to get an overview of
these geological oddities, as well as to learn more about the Fundy tides.
Part IV: New Brunswick 
216

The rock towers are scattered along a 2km (11⁄4-mile) stretch starting
immediately below the interpretive center, but the most impressive con-
centration is a 30-minute walk away, along a wooded trail. The alterna-
tive to walking is to catch a ride in an oversize golf cart. This costs just
C$1.50 each way; buy tickets at the main entrance or at the cart turn-
around point.
At the end of the trail/cart path, a steep metal stairway descends to the
muddy shoreline and the Flower Pot Rocks. To escape the summer
crowds, walk west along the beach (to the right from the bottom of the
stairs). Hoses are provided back at the top to clean the sticky, red mud
from the soles of your shoes.
The time of day you visit is restricted by the tide, but early morning is
best if you want to avoid the crowds. For shutterbugs, an early-morning
visit also offers more favorable light for photography. Check the Web
site www.thehopewellrocks.ca for a tide chart.
St. Andrews
On the Fundy Coast west of Saint John, St. Andrews is New Brunswick’s
most famous resort town. Laid out by Loyalists in 1783, the oldest part
of town has remained remarkably untouched by modern encroachment
and is protected as a National Historic Site.
St. Andrews was mainly a port city until it was discovered in the late
1880s by wealthy Americans looking to escape the summer heat of the
Eastern Seaboard. They stayed in grand resorts like the Algonquin or in
their own private estates, and St. Andrews was transformed.
Today, St. Andrews, population 2,000, is popular not only with vacation-
ing New Englanders, but also with Canadians who come to celebrate spe-
cial occasions, spend time out on the water, or simply stroll the streets
browsing through the many galleries and boutiques.
Getting there
Although St. Andrews is across the St. Croix River from Maine, access
from the United States is via the Calais/St. Stephen border crossing,
24km (15 miles) northwest.
From elsewhere in New Brunswick, the most direct access to St. Andrews
is Route 1 west along the Bay of Fundy from Saint John, a distance of
100km (62 miles). From Fredericton, 133km (83 miles) away, the most
direct way is Route 3 via St. Stephen.
Just before entering the town proper, make a stop at the St. Andrews
Welcome Centre, in a converted residence at 46 Reed Ave. (% 506-529-
3556). It’s open May through September daily 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (and until
9 p.m. in July and Aug).

by beautifully landscaped grounds, and has been converted to an inn with
an impeccable pedigree. The eight rooms have marble bathrooms, gas fire-
places, and canopy beds, topped with luxurious linens. Although bed-and-

but most have cooking facilities and bright, practical furnishings. The two-

dotted with Adirondack chairs, while the Sandpiper cottage is a cozy space

Treadwell Inn

Downtown
The seven-room, olive and burgundy-colored lodge, built in the 1820s for
a ship chandler, combines a waterfront setting with comfortable rooms to
make it one of the nicest places to stay in St. Andrews. The current owner’s
faultless taste shines through without taking away from the historical
charm. Of the well-furnished rooms, only two don’t have ocean views. My
fave? Room 5 (C$250), with a king-size bed, a bathroom with a soaker tub,
and wide doors that open to a private balcony with sweeping views across
Passamaquoddy Bay.

Dining in St. Andrews
Dining in St. Andrews compares favorably with much larger centers across
the Maritimes — a combination of an abundance of seafood and a century
of demand from well-heeled visitors.
The Gables
$$–$$$
St. Andrews
SEAFOOD
This restaurant lies down a narrow alley, beyond a giant woodcarving of a
lobster. It’s a casual affair, liberally decorated with netting and the like, all
salvaged from the sea. Seating is inside or out on a deck that extends to
above the high-tide mark. The cooking is simple but tasty. Plan on starting
with a plate piled high with steamed mussels. For mains, peruse the black-
board offerings, which feature whatever seafood is in season — lobster,
scallops, halibut, and haddock are all staples. The Gables opens for break-
fast in summer, with full cooked breakfasts costing a reasonable C$8.

CANADIAN
This historic teahouse is my favorite spot in St. Andrews for lunch,
although I have dropped by just for a piece of the melt-in-your-mouth
strawberry shortcake. Choose to dine in a cozy room and enjoy the won-
derful aromas that waft in from the kitchen, or sit out on the weathered
deck and take in the view across Passamaquoddy Bay. In the evening, you
can indulge in the rich seafood chowder or skewered scallops, grilled with
a ginger and curry glaze. If you weren’t here at lunch, end your meal with
the shortcake; otherwise, go for the triple chocolate brownie sundae. The
salmon eggs Benedict (C$13), served at Sunday brunch, is to die for.

Exploring St. Andrews
If you’d like to take a self-guided walking tour of St. Andrews, pick up a
map highlighting points of interest from the Welcome Centre. If you’re
heading out on your own, here are some sights you don’t want to miss.
Atlantic Salmon Interpretive Centre
Very different from St. Andrews’ historical attractions, this is the public
portion of a research station that studies one of Canada’s most important
fishing exports. The modern interpretive center nestles in a lush forest,
right over a stream where salmon spawn. Inside the timber-frame building
are displays on the life cycle of the salmon and the ongoing fight to save
its habitat, as well as some old fly-fishing equipment. A trail leads down-
stream to Chamcook Harbour and upstream to shallow gravel beds where
the fish spawn.
Route 127 (6km/33⁄4 miles toward Saint John). % 506-529-1384. Internet: www.asf.
ca. Admission C$5 adults, C$4 seniors, C$3 children. Open: Mid-May to Sept daily 
9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Kingsbrae Garden
Once part of the sprawling Kingsbrae Arms Estate, this 11-hectare (27-acre)
plot is generally regarded as one of the top ten gardens in Canada. The Rose
Garden, filled with fragrant old varieties, is from the original estate; the
White Garden is composed entirely of white and silver blossoms; and the
Scents and Sensitivity Garden allows visually impaired visitors to experi-
ence distinct smells and textures up close. And new gardens are always
being added — the Gravel Garden addresses modern environmental 
Part IV: New Brunswick

concerns by using a minimum of water. In other parts of the grounds, you’ll
find a scaled-down working windmill, a wooden maze, and fish-filled ponds.
Complement your visit with a bowl of steaming seafood chowder in 
the Garden Café. Kingsbrae is a ten-minute walk up King Street from the
waterfront.
220 King St. % 866-566-8687 or 506-529-3335. Admission C$9 adults, C$7.50 seniors
and children over 5. Open: Mid-May to mid-Oct daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.
Minister’s Island
Once the summer retreat of William Van Horne, the driving force behind
the completion of Canada’s transcontinental railway, this small island
holds one of the finest private residences that you are likely to come
across in Canada. Built of locally quarried sandstone, the mansion is
notable for its 50 rooms, including a massive drawing room and a billiard
room with the original table. On the grounds is a sandstone bathhouse
with a tidal swimming pool.
Getting to the island is an adventure in itself. The only access is at low tide
(ask at the visitor center or dial % 506-529-5081 to hear a recorded mes-
sage with exact tide and tour times), at which time everyone meets at the
end of Bar Road from where an escort is provided across the dry sea floor
to the island. You must have your own vehicle.
Bar Road (off Mowat Drive). % 506-529-5081. Admission C$12 adults, C$10 seniors
and children over 5. Tours: June to mid-Oct; times vary with the tide.
Ross Memorial Museum
Formerly the summer retreat of a wealthy American family named Ross, this
neat two-story 1824 home was deeded to the town to help preserve local
history. It offers a glimpse into the life of the Rosses, with rooms that remain
much as they left them, filled with fine furnishings and original paintings.
188 Montague St. % 506-529-5124. Admission: Donation. Open: Early June to early
Oct Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Other cool things to do in and around St. Andrews
Several companies run sightseeing trips on Passamaquoddy Bay, or you
can go whale-watching or kayaking. The Day Adventure Centre, beside
Market Wharf (% 506-529-2600), represents various operators, or
choose from one of these options:
 Whale-watching: Fundy Tide Runners, Market Wharf (% 506-529-
4481), uses a stable Zodiac to reach whale-watching grounds out in
the Bay of Fundy. Tours last two hours and cost C$50 adults, C$35
children. The whale-watching season is June through September.
 Sea kayaking: Even if you’ve never kayaked before, the guides 
at Seascape Kayak Tours, 165 Water St. (% 866-747-1884 or 506-
747-1884), will make you feel at ease on a two-hour introductory
paddle from their seafront headquarters; C$50 per person.
Chapter 16: Saint John and the Fundy Coast 221

 Tide watching: Walk north along Water Street to reach St. Andrews
Blockhouse National Historic Site. Built in the early 1800s to pro-
tect the town from attack, the grassy bank in front of this wooden
building is the perfect place to watch the tide receding.
 Golfing: It will feel like you’re out at sea as you stand on the 12th
tee at Fairmont Algonquin Golf Club, Brandy Cove Road (% 506-
529-7142), aiming for a tiny patch of green perched on a nub of
land surrounded by water. High season greens fees are C$99.
Shopping
Artisans are attracted to St. Andrews for the inspiration of its scenic set-
ting, and you can’t deny that the area is beautiful. But the more cynical
may say that affluent visitors with pockets full of cash are the real draw.
Regardless, the end result is a street lined with galleries and boutiques,
including the following:
 Jarea Art Studio & Gallery, 166 Montaque St. (% 506-529-4936),
displays the unusual art of Geoffrey David-Slater, whose work fea-
tures a single line that changes color but remains unbroken.
 Serendipin’ Art, 168 Water St. (% 506-529-3327), features colorful
hand-blown glass fish and creative wood turning.
 The Whale Store, 173 Water St. (% 506-529-3926) is highlighted by
stylish whale woodcarvings.
 If you want to find that perfect nautical-themed painting, start your
search at the Seacoast Gallery, 174 Water St. (% 506-529-0005).
 Gumushel’s Tartan Shop, 183 Water St. (% 506-529-3859), sells
tartan ties, berets, and jackets — but you guessed that from the
name, didn’t you?
 St. Andrews Hardware, 189 Water St. (% 506-529-3158), is filled 
to the rafters with a hodgepodge of hardware and nautical-themed
knickknacks.
Fundy Isles
Spending time on one or more of the Fundy Isles is a unique and memo-
rable addition to your travels along the Fundy Coast. The three main
islands, Deer, Campobello, and Grand Manan, are all linked to the main-
land by ferry and easily visited in a day. You can explore the islands or, 
if you prefer, head out to the water to marvel at marine life or try your
hand at some of the area’s popular watersports.
Deer Island
It may be named for a land mammal, but life on this small island revolves
around the ocean. The importance of the lobster industry is clear — you’ll
see the pounds used to hold live lobsters scattered around the shoreline.
To get to the island, catch the free ferry (departures year-round, every 
Part IV: New Brunswick 
222

30 minutes) from Letete, south of St. George. You can explore the island in
just a few hours, but allow two extra hours to take a whale-watching trip
with Billy Mac Tours (% 506-747-2307). Sunset Beach Cottage & Suites,
on the west side of the island at 21 Cedar Grove Road (% 506-747-2972;
www.cottageandsuites.com), is right on the beach and has an outdoor
pool; rates for the five kitchen-equipped suites and one cottage are C$70
to C$100 double, which is in the $-to-$$ range. Open May to October.
Campobello Island
A summer-only ferry links Deer and Campobello Islands, but most visitors
cross to the island by bridge from Lubec, Maine — even those visiting
from New Brunswick, as St. Stephen is just 70km (43 miles) away by road.
Franklin Roosevelt’s family members were perhaps the most notable of
the many wealthy people who have spent their summers here. His 34-
room cottage is protected as part of Roosevelt Campobello International
Park (% 506-752-2922). The grounds are open year-round while the
home is open for inspection late May through mid-October daily 10 a.m. 
to 6 p.m. Admission is free.
An adjacent property, once owned by Roosevelt’s cousin, has been con-
verted to Lupine Lodge (% 888-912-8880 or 506-752-2555; www.lupine
lodge.com), with 11 woodsy rooms in two log cottages. Rates are C$85
to C$150 per unit ($$). The restaurant here is recommended for its
simple presentations of local seafood. A good source of island informa-
tion is the Web site www.campobello.com.
Grand Manan Island
Grand Manan is larger than the other Fundy Isles and much farther from
the mainland. Bird-watchers in particular are drawn to the island —
famed naturalist John James Audubon spent time here painting. Other
draws are seal and whale-watching, biking, hiking, and a string of sandy
beaches.
Coastal Transport (% 506-662-3724; www.coastaltransport.ca)
operates ferries year-round, four to seven times daily between Blacks
Harbour (take Exit 60 from Route 1) and the island. The crossing takes
two hours. The round-trip fare is C$11 adults, C$5.20 children, C$31 vehi-
cles. Reservations are only taken for the return journey from the island
to the mainland.
Don’t look farther than the Swallowtail Inn, at 50 Lighthouse Rd. near
the ferry dock (% 866-563-1100 or 506-662-1100; www.swallowtail
inn.com), for a gorgeous setting high atop a rocky bluff. Formerly a
lighthouse keeper’s residence, the six guest rooms (C$85–C$125; $$)
have en suites and ocean views.
Island Coast Whale Tours (% 877-662-9393 or 506-662-8181) takes 
visitors on five-hour boat tours searching out humpback, finback, and
minke whales. Whale sightings are guaranteed through the July to mid-
September season. The cost is C$50 adults, C$25 children. Sea Watch

(C$55 for three hours), rents bikes (C$22 per day), and rents cabins scat-
tered through the island (from C$100 per night). In addition to being a
wonderful way to explore the island, using a bike means you don’t need
to bring a vehicle across on the ferry, saving both the expense and, more
important, a possible long wait in line to board.

F
redericton (population 50,500), the capital of New Brunswick, is an
appealing and practical stopping place with classic Victorian archi-
tecture, interesting museums, riverfront pathways, and an excellent
range of lodging and dining options.
In 1793, at the end of the American Revolution, around 2,000 Americans
loyal to the British crown made their way north into the Saint John River
Valley. They set up camp at a site that had been the one-time capital of
Acadia. These Loyalists set out to create a gracious town, and this sense
of style remains today.
Getting to Fredericton
Fredericton is accessible by plane and bus, but most people arrive by
automobile, driving in via an excellent provincial highway system.
By plane
Greater Fredericton Airport (www.frederictonairport.ca) is 14km
(83⁄4 miles) southeast of downtown via Route 102. Air Canada and its sub-
sidiary Air Canada Jazz fly in daily from Halifax, Toronto, Ottawa, and
Montreal. Delta Air Lines links Fredericton with Boston.
Taxis line up out front of the main terminal and charge around C$20 to
take you downtown. Car rental companies that maintain desks at the air-
port are Avis, Budget, Hertz, and National.
By car
Route 2 (Trans-Canada Highway) is the main highway from Moncton 
and all points east, including Halifax. The drive from Moncton is 174km
(108 miles), or around two hours.

Entering New Brunswick near Edmundston, Route 2 follows the winding
Saint John River all the way to Fredericton for 290km (180 miles), which
means you should allow at least four hours.
If you’re traveling up the Acadian Coast from Moncton, take Route 8
from Miramichi south through the heart of New Brunswick to reach
Fredericton in two hours.
Route 7 is the most direct road between Saint John and Fredericton
(105km/65 miles), but Route 102 along the Saint John River is a more
scenic alternative.
By bus
Acadian (% 506-458-6007) buses arrive at 101 Regent St. (at Brunswick
Street), the same location as a Discount car rental agency (% 506-452-
7620) and within walking distance of downtown hotels.
Getting Around Fredericton
Downtown Fredericton lies on the inside of a bend in the Saint John
River. King and Queen streets, running parallel to the river, are the main
thoroughfares. North Fredericton, on the north side of the river, is
mostly residential. It’s linked to downtown by the Westmorland St.
Bridge. Farther east, the Trail Bridge, starting at the corner of Brunswick
Street and University Avenue, is for pedestrians only. Even if you don’t
need to get to the other side, consider crossing the bridge just for the
views that extend back across downtown — you can see the higher
buildings rising above the tree-lined riverbank.
Parking
You’ve gotta love a city that welcomes visitors with free parking. At the
visitor center at the corner of Queen and York streets, show proof that you
are from out of province — such as a driver’s license — and the staff will
issue you a two-day parking permit valid at all parking meters and at the
lot at the north end of York Street, immediately behind the visitor center.
Catching cabs
Hailing a taxi is easy along Queen and King streets. If you’re really stuck,
you can always go to the Lord Beaverbrook Hotel and have the front
desk attendant call one for you. Among the local companies are Checker
Cabs (% 506-450-8294), Loyal Taxi (% 506-455-6789), and Standard
Taxi (% 506-450-4444).
Riding transit
Fredericton Transit (% 506-460-2200) operates city buses along 12
routes Monday through Saturday 6:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. The fare is C$1.75
per sector (children 6 and under ride free). Exact change is required.

Staying in Fredericton
The following recommendations are my preferences in various price cat-
egories. Downtown accommodations are within walking distance of the
riverfront and most major attractions.
Room rates in Fredericton don’t fluctuate as much as elsewhere in the
Maritimes, but offer good value year-round. If you’re just looking for a
regular motel room, consult the provincial tourism guide, or cruise the
arterial roads for posted vacancies (start along Route 105, across the
river from downtown). The friendly staff at the City Hall visitor center
will be more than happy to help you find a last-minute room.
Carriage House Inn

Downtown
Built in 1875 for a one-time mayor of Fredericton, this three-story Queen
Anne-style mansion lies 1 block from a riverfront pathway leading right to

Victorian theme and filled with antiques. A cooked breakfast, served in a
sunny side room, is included in the rates. Children under ten are not
allowed at this inn.

guest rooms that mix modern conveniences like air-conditioning and wire-
less Internet with antiques and historical charm. The sunny rear garden

Dining in Fredericton
You can indulge in a surprising range of cuisine in this outwardly staid
city, thanks in part to the population of worldly university students.
Outdoor dining is a treat that locals take full advantage of throughout
the summer.
Blue Door
$–$$$
Downtown
FUSION
It’s difficult to miss this casual and colorful downtown restaurant — just
look for the historic brick building with bright red shutters, distinctive
white trim and yes, a blue door. In good weather, enjoy your meal (or just
a martini) on the large patio. The energetic owners have brought their
West Coast experiences to Fredericton, offering dishes that combine
Canadian produce with spices and cooking styles from around the Pacific
Rim. You’ll be hooked on the flavorful seafood stew, which is full of shrimp,
mussels, haddock, and salmon. Other choices are varied: Try the sake-mar-
inated salmon or pork ribs smothered in house-made barbecue sauce.
Non-meat-eaters (as well as meat-eaters) will love the pad Thai, a filling
noodle dish.

Downtown
BREAKFAST
The story sounds good — a Quebec woman makes good with a local cafe
that serves up healthy breakfasts in a cheery environment, and then fran-
chises the concept across eastern Canada. In reality, you get a Denny’s-
style breakfast with a couple of slices of fruit on the side. Your best bet is
the crepes, which range from an adventurous spinach/cheddar combo to
a sweet and creamy Strawberry Satisfaction. This place stands out
because of its bright color scheme, fun-loving furnishings (lots of stuffed
chickens), and walls graffitied with the names of dishes. Kids will love the
fun atmosphere, and parents will fall for the reasonable prices. Breakfast
is served all day; lunch is from 11 a.m. until the mid-afternoon closing.

El Burrito Loco

Downtown
MEXICAN
Locals are drawn in droves to this smallish restaurant for one reason: the
authentic Mexican cooking of owner Carlos Perez Huerta. Everything from
the guacamole to the taco shells is created in-house. In warmer weather,
you’ll need to reserve ahead to snag a table on the patio. Occasional live
entertainment creates a fun vibe.

Governors’ Room
$$$–$$$$
Downtown
CONTINENTAL
The intimate setting and consistently high quality of food make the
Governor’s Room popular with locals celebrating a special occasion and
business travelers dining on expense accounts (it’s ensconced in a
bustling business hotel). The kitchen concentrates on classic European
cooking. For starters, try shrimp bisque topped with brandied croutons.
Then move on to grilled venison topped with black currant and port sauce,
or roasted rack of lamb brushed with Dijon mayonnaise. End the meal with
a rum-based, nut-topped ice cream Bananas Foster.
Also in the hotel is the informal Terrace Room, with a wide-ranging hotel
menu and a large deck overlooking the river, and the Maverick Room, an
upscale steak and seafood restaurant.

Rye’s Deli & Bar

Downtown
DELI/PUB FARE
The combination of healthy deli food and traditional pub fare may seem a
little strange, but Rye’s does it well. The interior is publike, but if the
weather is warm, you’ll want to be on the street-front trellised patio. The
specialty is smoked meat on rye or in a wrap (all under C$12), a perfect
lunchtime meal, although the portions are huge and can pass for dinner.
Other notable offerings include Cajun-spiced chicken nachos and a tangy
Thai chicken and bacon burger. The most popular breakfast dish — with
good reason, as I found out after dining here — is huevos rancheros.

Exploring Fredericton
Queen Street, 1 block from and running parallel to the Saint John River,
is lined with historic sights and attractions. Most major sights are within
Chapter 17: Fredericton 231

walking distance of the City Hall at 397 Queen St., which houses the
Visitor Information Centre (% 506-460-2129), open April through
October daily 8:15 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (July and Aug 8 a.m.–8 p.m.).
Historic Garrison District
Due to its status as the capital of New Brunswick and to the proximity of
the United States border, Fredericton was the headquarters to a large con-
tingent of British military personnel. After Confederation in 1867, the mili-
tary moved on, but much of the character remains within the walls of the
old military compound, now protected as the Historic Garrison District
National Historic Site, located right downtown. Inside the precinct’s
wrought-iron fence are a number of historic buildings. In addition to 
the two attractions discussed later, one room in the imposing Soldiers’
Barracks is open to the public (July and Aug daily 10 a.m.–7 p.m.). The 
cellars of this same building provide a summer home for local artists 
selling their wares.
A troupe of costumed performers lead free, one-hour theatrical walking
tours of the historic precinct in July and August. The meeting place and
time is City Hall, 397 Queen St., daily at 10 a.m., 2:30 p.m., and 5 p.m. Call
% 506-460-2129 for details.
Guard House
Downtown
The interior of this solid stone building looks much as it did when occu-
pied by garrison guards in the mid-1800s, complete with muskets at the
ready and uniforms hanging along one wall. The adjacent windowless cell-
block is also open for inspection. Try to time your visit with the outdoor
musical presentations, which take place on the veranda through summer
on Wednesdays at 12:30 p.m.
In July and August, daily at 11:15 a.m., children have the opportunity to
dress up as a soldier, parade through the grounds, and, of course, have
their picture taken out front of the Guard House. The cost is C$8 per child.
See map p. 227. Carleton St. % 506-460-2129. Admission: Free. Open: July–Aug daily
10 a.m.–6 p.m.
York Sunbury Museum
Downtown
Finding a home in the Officer’ Quarters, this old-fashioned museum spills
from the room with an eclectic display of memorabilia. Much of the space
is devoted to telling the story of the Mi’Kmaq and the early European 
settlers, but expect a couple of surprises, including a stuffed 17-kilogram
(37-pound) frog.
See map p. 227. 571 Queen St. % 506-455-6041. Admission: C$3 adults, C$1 children.

Other Fredericton sights
Beaverbrook Art Gallery
Downtown
A gift to the city from the late press baron Lord Beaverbrook, this is one
of Canada’s premier art galleries. The building’s rather dour exterior belies
the treasures inside, most notably Salvador Dalí’s Santiago el Grande. The
gallery is also home to an impressive collection of works by other
European masters — J. M. W. Turner, John Constable, and Augustus John,
as well as works of Canada’s best-known artists from all eras, including
Emily Carr.
Kids are encouraged to try their hand at painting and drawing in a special
summer program operated by the gallery. Children aged 5 to 8 are invited
to the 10 a.m. session, while those aged 9 to 12 attend the 2 p.m. sitting.
Classes last around two hours and cost C$15 per child.
See map p. 227. 703 Queen St. % 506-458-2028. www.beaverbrookartgallery.
org. Admission: C$8 adults, C$6 seniors, C$3 children. Open: June–Sept daily 
9 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Oct–May Tues–Sat 9 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Sun noon to 5:30 p.m.
Christ Church Cathedral
Downtown
For over 150 years, the single spire of this compact Gothic Revival church
has dominated the Fredericton skyline. Rising regally from the surround-
ing residences and the tree-lined riverbank, the building was modeled on
the 1340 St. Mary’s Church in the village of Snettisham, Norfolk.
The most beautiful of many stained-glass windows is on the east side and
is best viewed from the nave. From this central location, the morning sun
illuminates a seven-paneled scene depicting Christ on the cross, flanked by
three apostles on either side. Facing the nave from the northern transept
is a massive organ comprising 1,500 pipes.
See map p. 227. 168 Brunswick St. % 506-450-8500. www.christchurch
cathedral.com. Church tours (free) are offered mid-June through Aug Mon–Fri
9 a.m.–6 p.m. July–Aug chamber music recitals are held every Fri 12:10–12:50 p.m.
Old Government House
Downtown
An impressive stone structure set on the banks of the Saint John River, this
mansion was built in 1826 as the official residence of the governor, and
served as such until 1892. In the ensuing years, it housed a school for the
deaf, functioned as a hospital, and was the headquarters of the RCMP in
New Brunswick. In the late 1990s, a massive overhaul of the grand old
building saw it return to its original use as the home of the lieutenant gov-
ernor, the representative of the Queen Elizabeth II in New Brunswick. Great
care was taken in the restoration work to properly replicate the original
Chapter 17: Fredericton 233

look, right down to the carpet and draperies. The governor’s living quar-
ters are on the top floor, away from the eyes of the public, but the rest of
the building is open for tours throughout the year. Rooms restored to their
former look include the library, formal dining room, and drawing room.
See map p. 227. 51 Woodstock Rd. % 506-453-2505. Admission: Free. Open: Mid-
June to mid-Sept daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m., mid-Sept to mid-June Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Science East
Downtown
Set in a stone jail that dates to 1840 and was used as a prison until 1996, this
fun attraction will keep enquiring minds occupied for at least a few hours.
Everywhere you turn are interesting displays and interactive activities —
an oversize kaleidoscope, an insectarium, and the chance to create a mini-
tornado are the more popular ones. Outdoor amusements center on a large
playground. The building’s former life has been preserved in the grim dun-
geon, where displays describe the most notorious inmates and tell the story
of the last hanging.
See map p. 227. 668 Brunswick St. % 506-457-2340. www.scienceeast.nb.ca.
Admission: C$6 adults, C$5 seniors, C$3 children. Open: July–Aug Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–
5 p.m., Sun 1–5 p.m.; Sept–June Mon–Sat noon to 5 p.m.
Other cool things to see and do in Fredericton
Fredericton has a well-marked trail system, good for walking or biking.
The downtown section extends east from the front of the Fredericton
Sheraton to the Princess Margaret Bridge. Along the way is the Trail
Bridge, originally built for trains but which now provides a pleasant link
to North Fredericton for cyclists and pedestrians.
You can also take a break from sightseeing to:
 Climb a lighthouse. The nationalistic red-and-white Lighthouse
Adventure Centre, at the foot of Regent Street (% 506-460-2939),
was built as a tourist attraction. To climb to the top costs C$2
adults, C$1.50 seniors and children. At street level is a booking
desk for attractions throughout the region. You can also rent bikes
and canoes here. It’s open July and August daily 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
September daily noon to 7 p.m.
 Take a river cruise. The Carleton II takes up to 100 passengers on
one-hour cruises along the downtown shoreline. The cost is a very
reasonable C$10 adults, C$5 children. The departure point is Regent
Street Wharf, behind the Lighthouse Adventure Centre (% 506-454-
2628). Tours run June through August, up to five times daily.
 Explore an urban forest. At 175-hectare (430-acre) Odell Park,
ducks frolic on a small pond, trails lead through various forest envi-
ronments, and large grassy areas are perfect for stretching out and

234

doing absolutely nothing. In the southern section (access from
Waggoner’s Road) is an arboretum containing all of New Brunswick’s
native tree species.
 Wander among headstones. Walk up Carleton Street to Brunswick
Street to reach the Old Public Burial Ground, the final resting
place of the city’s earliest residents.
 Head back to school. Founded in 1785, the University of New
Brunswick, Bailey Drive (% 506-453-4666), is North America’s
oldest public university. Feel free to walk the grounds.
 Go golfing. Picturesque Kingswood Park Golf Course, south of
downtown along Hanwell Road (% 800-423-5969 or 506-443-3333),
stretches over 7,000 yards from the back markers. Big bunkers,
rolling fairways, and a 10m (33-foot) waterfall on the signature 
14th hole define the layout. Greens fees are C$65.
Shopping
You may be surprised at the diversity of shops in the downtown area,
especially along the lower end of York Street, where an old-fashioned
drug store, trendy import stores, and secondhand clothing shops sit
side by side.
Fredericton has mall shopping along Prospect Street, including the
Fredericton Mall, at 1150 Prospect St. (% 506-458-9226).
Antiques
Old Tyme Collectibles, 40 Main St. (% 506-451-9218), is the largest 
of Fredericton’s antiques shops. Across the road is This Old Thing
Antiques, at 173 King St. (% 506-454-4317). Both have solid collections of
Maritimes furniture and knickknacks from the late 1800s and early 1900s.
Arts and crafts
The centrally located Gallery Connexion, at 453 Queen St. (% 506-454-
1433) is an artist-operated, not-for-profit outlet where artists work in
situ. Open Tuesday through Friday only. Also within the Garrison
Historic District is River Valley Fine Crafts, a string of vendors with
summer-only outlets on the lower level of the Soldier’s Barracks (% 506-
460-2837). Look for handmade soaps and candles, jewelry, knitted cloth-
ing, and more. Aitkens Pewter has a more traditional setting, at 408
Queen St. (% 506-453-9474), along with free tours of their workshop.
The New Brunswick Crafts Council displays an eclectic range of its
members’ work at a gallery within the Charlotte Street Arts Centre, at
732 Charlotte St. (% 506-450-8989).
Gallery 78, at 796 Queen St. (% 506-450-8989), housed in a converted
century-old residence just a few blocks east of the main downtown core,
Chapter 17: Fredericton 235

is worth visiting to view the building itself. But the art is worth a peek,
too — the gallery sells mostly contemporary Canadian work at prices
that aren’t as high as you may expect.
Books
Westminster Books, 445 King St. (% 800-561-7323 or 506-454-1442) is
Fredericton’s premier independent bookstore. You can pick up everything
from the latest bestsellers to local fiction, along with maps and specialty
guidebooks. For secondhand and rare books, browse the floor-to-ceiling
shelves at Owl’s Nest Bookstore, at 390 Queen St. (% 506-458-5509).
Market
The W.W. Boyce Farmers’ Market, 665 George St. at Regent Street 
(% 506-451-1815), is open year-round, Saturday 6 a.m. to 1 p.m. It
attracts hordes of locals who come for fresh produce, meats, and
cheeses, as well as local arts and crafts.
Nightlife
Fredericton isn’t particularly known for its nightlife, but warm summer
nights keep numerous decks and patios busy, while the populations of
two universities keep the downtown spots busy the rest of the year.
Pubs and clubs
Most pubs and clubs are within walking distance of each other in the
downtown core. Here are a few options:
 The Lunar Rogue, 625 King St. (% 506-450-2065), is an English-
style pub with lots of draft beer choices. The patio hops on hot
nights.
 Rye’s Deli & Bar, 73 Carleton St. (% 506-472-7937), has a small
outdoor patio, and books jazz and blues music acts on weekends.
 Dolan’s Pub, 349 King St. (% 506-454-7474), has a traditional pub
atmosphere and live East Coast music.
 The Dip Pool Bar, set beside an outdoor swimming pool, is located
in the Delta Fredericton at 225 Woodstock Rd. (% 506-457-7000),
and offers a resort atmosphere.
 After Dark Club, at 87 York St. (% 506-457-9805) is a two-level
complex where younger crowds gather to drink (downstairs) and
dance (upstairs).
 Nicky Zee’s, 375 King St. (% 506-455-6408), is another of the city’s
hottest nightclubs, but more intimate than After Dark.

The arts
Fredericton Playhouse, at 686 Queen St. (% 506-458-8344; www.the
playhouse.ca), is the capital’s main venue for performing arts and live
music. Symphony New Brunswick and Theatre New Brunswick regularly
perform here.
Side Trips from Fredericton
The Saint John River flows past Fredericton, draining into the Bay of
Fundy at Saint John. If you’re traveling between these two cities, the
detour to pretty Gagetown is well worthwhile.
Upstream of Fredericton are a string of historic riverside towns, along
with Kings Landing Historical Settlement, which re-creates a Loyalist 
village from 200 years ago.
Gagetown
Historic Gagetown is regarded by many as one of the picturesque vil-
lages in all of the Maritimes. Laid out by Loyalists in 1783, the streets lie
parallel to Gagetown Creek and are lined with stately trees and carefully
restored buildings, some over 200 years old. The surrounding country-
side is equally appealing — think apple orchards, grazing cattle, and the
wide Saint John River dotted with islands.
To get to Gagetown from Fredericton, follow Route 2 (Trans-Canada
Highway) east for 50km (31 miles) and take Exit 330 to the south.
Following Route 102 from the capital takes a little longer, but the scenery
is more eye-catching.
In the center of the village, Queens County Museum is a whitewashed
home at 69 Front St. (% 506-488-2966) filled with Loyalist antiques. It’s
open June to mid-September daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is C$2.
Gagetown is a fertile ground for shopping. One of my favorite stores is
Jugglers Cove Fine Arts & Crafts, 32 Tilley Rd. (% 506-488-2574),
which displays a colorful range of pottery and paintings. Loomcrafters,
23 Loomcraft Lane (% 506-488-2400), located in a structure dating to
1761 at the east end of Tilley Road, is the place to pick up handmade
woven items.
Mactaquac and area
The highlight of the Mactaquac area, west of Fredericton, is King’s
Landing Historical Settlement, but Mactaquac Provincial Park is also
worth exploring. Protecting the shoreline of a reservoir formed by the
Mactaquac Dam, which spans the Saint John River, activities on offer
include canoeing (rentals available), golfing (greens fees C$48; % 506-
363-4926), and hiking. To get to the park, cross the Saint John River via
Chapter 17: Fredericton 237

Fredericton’s Westmorland St. Bridge and follow Route 105 west for
24km (15 miles). Park gates open daily at 8 a.m. and entry costs C$7 per
vehicle per day.
From the park, retrace your path and drive south across the Mactaquac
Dam to reach Route 2.
Kings Landing Historical Settlement
King’s Landing
Fleeing the American Revolution in 1783, around 15,000 people loyal to
Britain headed north to New Brunswick. They established settlements
throughout the region, including Saint-Anne, on the site of present-day
Fredericton. King’s Landing is a re-creation of one of these villages, histor-
ically accurate down to the last detail and fun for the whole family. Over
100 costumed staff “live” here, transporting visitors along dirt roads in
horse-drawn carts, tending to crops, picking apples in the orchard, craft-
ing horseshoes in the blacksmith shop, and cooking simple meals for vis-
itors in the King’s Head Inn. Children will love the outdoor theater
program, while all ages will enjoy the ice-cream shop.
20 King’s Landing Rd., King’s Landing (Exit 253 from Route 2). % 506-363-4999. www.
kingslanding.nb.ca. Admission C$15 adults, C$13 seniors, C$10 children. Open:
June to mid-Oct daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.

Kissing bridges
If your travels include driving around New Brunswick, you’ll no doubt notice that an
abundance of covered wooden bridges dot the province. Now a symbol of New
Brunswick, the enclosures, affectionately referred to as “kissing bridges,” were orig-
inally created to protect the wood from weathering by sun and rain — not to provide
an opportunity for a romantic rendezvous. It was estimated that uncovered bridges
lasted around ten years, while those that were covered would last many times longer.
The fact that 66 covered bridges remain is a testament to their durability.
Some of the easiest bridges to find are along the upper Saint John River Valley.
Heading north from Kings Landing, the Nackawic Siding Covered Bridge straddles
Route 585 west of Millville, while in Benton, west of Meductic, the Benton Village
Covered Bridge is in a particularly scenic locale.
Farther north, the Hartland Covered Bridge, in the town of Hartland, stretches for 390m
(1,280 feet) across the Saint John River, making it the world’s longest covered bridge.
The visitor center on the east side of the bridge has displays telling the story of this and
other bridges in the province.

Part V
Prince Edward
Island

In this part . . . 
P
otatoes, lobsters, and an orphan girl named Anne are
the best-known exports from Prince Edward Island, a
serene oasis unlike anywhere else in Canada. Usually referred
to simply as “PEI,” it may be the country’s smallest province,
but for many visitors it’s the most memorable. Beyond the
historic capital of Charlottetown, a patchwork of ﬁelds
extends in all directions, ringed by red cliffs that descend to
often calm ocean waters. Dotted throughout this landscape
are painted farmhouses, quaint towns, and ﬁshing villages.
The Island became more accessible in 1997 with the comple-
tion of the Confederation Bridge that links it to the mainland,
yet the atmosphere on the Island remains mellow. The
summer visiting season attracts visitors from around the
world to Cavendish, the setting for Anne of Green Gables,
while vacationing families from throughout the Maritimes are
drawn to surrounding beaches.

W
ith a population of 33,000, Charlottetown is Canada’s smallest
provincial capital and like no other city in the country. A distinct
lack of pretense and an unhurried feel make it decidedly un-capital–like,
while its tree-lined downtown streets and incredibly rich history only
add to the charm.
In summer, downtown Charlottetown bustles with activity. Its central
location makes it a natural draw for visitors and its well-priced lodgings
and cultural events make the city a perfect base for day trips to other
island destinations (Cavendish, for example, less than an hour’s drive
away).
Getting There
Sitting in the central portion of Queens County, Charlottetown is at the
hub of a varied road system that includes everything from the major
thoroughfares to narrow back roads. The most important of these roads
is the Trans-Canada Highway, which links Charlottetown to the mainland
by bridge and ferry.
By plane
Air Canada has direct flights to Charlottetown from Halifax, Montreal,
and Toronto. WestJet flies in from Toronto and Northwest connects
Charlottetown to Detroit through summer only. Charlottetown Airport
(www.flypei.com) is 8km (5 miles) north of downtown. A Passenger
Facility Fee of C$15 is incorporated into the fare for departing flights.
Charlottetown has no airport shuttle service, but a row of taxis waits out
front of the arrivals terminal, charging C$11 per person plus C$3 for
every extra person for the ride downtown.

Avis, Budget, Hertz, and National car rental companies have airport
desks and vehicles are parked within easy walking distance of the
arrivals area. The number of vehicles is limited, so make reservations as
far in advance as possible. For information on contacting major car
rental companies, see the Appendix.
By car
The Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) crosses to Prince Edward
Island via the Confederation Bridge, 60km (37 miles) from the capital. If
you cross to the Island via the ferry, it’s a similar distance from the dock
to downtown.
By bus
Acadian (% 800-567-5151 or 902-628-6432; www.acadianbus.com) has
service three times daily between Moncton and Charlottetown, with con-
nections in Moncton from throughout the Maritimes. The Charlottetown
bus depot is at 156 Belvedere Ave. PEI Express Shuttle (% 877-877-1771
or 902-462-8177; www.peishuttle.com) offers van service between
Halifax and Charlottetown for adult C$55, senior C$50, child C$45 each
way. The trip takes five hours, with pickup and drop-offs made at major

The downtown core of Charlottetown is very compact. Almost all the
accommodations recommended here are within walking distance of the
best restaurants. Scattered throughout are the main city attractions,
including the very central Province House, with other buildings of his-
torical interest, the best shops, and the harbor all within 6 blocks.
Downtown streets are laid out in a grid pattern. Those running north-
west to southeast end at Water Street, which runs along the harborfront.
At its north end, Water Street merges with the eastbound Trans-Canada

Confederation Bridge
Completed in 1997, the Confederation Bridge links Prince Edward Island to the rest of
Canada. It’s the world’s longest single-span bridge — 13km (8 miles) from Cape
Jourimain, New Brunswick, to Borden-Carleton, just an hour west of Charlottetown
in PEI. Built at a cost of almost C$1 billion, it comprises 44 spans, each as long as a
city block, and extends up to 20m (66 feet) above Northumberland Strait.
Driving to the Island is free. The toll (C$41 for all two-axle vehicles) is only collected
on the return journey.

Highway. University Avenue is the major northbound artery. North of the
university, you can take Malpeque Road to Route 2 toward Cavendish
and the North Shore, or head west along the Trans-Canada Highway to
the Confederation Bridge.
Parking
Public parking is spread along Water Street. Parking meters and pay lots
cost C50¢ per hour on weekdays. Look for free street parking on the out-
skirts of downtown (try northeast of Prince Street). Parking is free
everywhere on weekends.
The best place to park and start your exploration of the city is the main
information center along Water Street at Hillsborough Street. Don’t
forget to pick up a voucher for one hour’s free parking in the adjacent lot
at the information center.
Transit and tours
Charlottetown Transit (% 902-566-9962) serves mostly residential
areas along seven routes Monday through Saturday. The fare is C$2 per
sector.
Jump aboard the red double-decker bus operated by Abegweit
Sightseeing Tours (% 902-894-9966) to see all the downtown highlights
as well as outlying attractions, such as the lieutenant governor’s man-
sion, the University of Prince Edward Island campus, and Victoria Park.
The tour takes one hour and is bargain-priced at C$10 for adults and just
C$1 for children. The bus departs June through mid-September up to six
times daily, with pickup points in front of the Rodd Charlottetown and
the Queen Street side of the Confederation Centre of the Arts.
Staying in Charlottetown
Accommodations in Charlottetown are generally well priced and fall
within one of two categories: hotels or historic inns. Don’t associate the
city’s lower rates with a lack of services or charm — you get excellent
value for your money in Charlottetown, especially during non-summer
months.
Because the city is compact, you can plan on walking to all the top
attractions and restaurants from your room.

Downtown
Built in 1906 for a local entrepreneur, this elaborate Queen Anne Revival
building has housed an inn since 1972. It has gone through many changes
over the years, including the additions of an English-style pub, a dining
room, and a wing of motel rooms (known as the Annex). Through it all, the
Dundee Arms remains a charming choice for your stay in Charlottetown.
Guest rooms in the original building range from cutesy (Anne’s Room) to
staid (Chandler Suite), but all come packed with niceties, such as
bathrobes and Internet access.

Inns on Great George
$$$–$$$$
Downtown
Dating to the early 1800s, three adjoining town houses bookended by two
hotels and a smattering of surrounding buildings make up this grand lodg-
ing complex 1 block from Province House. In its heyday, the Pavilion Hotel
at Dorchester Street was the fashionable social center of the city and the
accommodations of choice for delegates attending the 1864 Charlottetown
Conference. This property now holds the most guest rooms (24) along with
the reception area and a sofa lounge — a comfortable gathering spot
where a light breakfast is served each morning. The layout and décor of
the guest rooms varies greatly, but all are thoroughly modern (en suites,
air-conditioning, high-speed Internet access, and so on). For a splurge, con-
sider one of the four Deluxe Stable House rooms, especially Room 222,
which features a kitchen, luxurious bathroom, original art, separate bed-
room, and lounge area with leather furniture and a fireplace. My favorite
rooms can be found in the Wellington Hotel, which combines historical
charm with modern styling at a reasonable price. Family Efficiencies, with
one to four bedrooms, are set up for families or small groups.

Downtown
A distinctive 1931 red-brick building with grand colonnades flanking its
entry, this downtown hotel is perfectly located for the tour group crowd.
The marble-floored lobby gives way to 115 elegant guest rooms decorated
with period reproductions. Amenities include a largish indoor pool, a fit-
ness room, and a sauna. You can take a break from seafood with the finest
cuts of beef in Chambers Restaurant, or relax with a cocktail in the adja-
cent lounge before searching out dinner at one of the many nearby restau-
rants. Weekend discounts are standard year-round, but the best deals are
packages advertised on the Rodd Web site.

Royalty Maples Cottages

North of Downtown
On the north side of downtown, close to the airport and perfect for getting
an early-morning start to Cavendish, this lodging is about as un-city-like as
you’ll ever find. It’s comprised of a collection of ten neat cottages and six
motel rooms set around a sprawling green space — perfect for children.

Shipwright Inn
$$–$$$$
Downtown
The water views that the original owner, a local shipbuilder, enjoyed from
this 1860s home are long gone, but the building’s solid timber construc-
tion — including the original hardwood floors — remains through exten-
sive restoration work. The end result is one of Charlottetown’s premier
accommodations. Each of the nine guest rooms has its own character and
configuration, but what they have in common is a distinct historical charm
and a subtle maritime theme. The rooms have amenities you expect in a
hotel — TV, air-conditioning, telephone, wireless Internet — as well as
many you don’t, like goose down duvets and nautical-themed antiques.
Even the smallest unit, the Chart Room (which really isn’t that small) has
a fireplace, a walnut four-poster bed, and, of course, nautical charts on the
walls. Breakfast is taken in a communal dining area, although I found
myself sneaking back through the day for the complimentary homemade
goodies and freshly squeezed lemonade.

CAFE
Of Charlottetown’s small selection of cafes, this is the best. You can take

all under C$10.

homeland, and naturally the menu features mostly seafood with a small
selection of other dishes. As the name suggests, oysters are the specialty,

and the tasting plate of ten for C$17 is a good starter to share. Or dive right
into typical mains like sesame-seed-crusted salmon or honey-mustard
lamb chops. A contemporary dining room, sharp service, and a delicious
dessert selection round out what many consider to be Charlottetown’s
finest restaurant.

SEAFOOD
This glorified oyster bar is on Victoria Row, a short section of Richmond
Street that is designated pedestrian-only throughout the summer months.
Choose to dine at tables out on the sidewalk, or inside at regular tables
and in very private booths. Malpeque Bay oysters are a natural starter.
They sit on a massive bed of ice, accompanied by your choice of sauces
for C$2 each. Other sample starters are a rich seafood chowder and
steamed mussels broiled in a garlic broth; mains include seafood harvest
salad and delicious chicken and lobster casserole. Lunches are mostly
under C$15, including tangy lemon-peppered haddock.

SEAFOOD
Wow! For those who like mussels, no place in the Maritimes is like this
simple cafe, where the island delicacy is steamed to order in 50 different
ways. Take your pick from Bombay (ginger, lime, curry, mango, and
cream), Maine (baby clams, white wine, cream, and parsley), Wild Turkey
(roast corn, green onions, kumquats, and bourbon), and more, many more.

A moolicious treat
Wowie Cowie. Deja Moo. Gooey Mooey. These are three of over 30 flavors you’ll be
confronted with at COWS, an Island institution whose ice cream holds up against the
best Ben & Jerry’s can offer (I’ve “researched” both). COWS uses handmade waffle
cones and an old-fashioned recipe that calls for the freshest Island cream. Started
from a single outlet in Cavendish, the company now has two stores in Charlottetown
(one at 150 Queen St. and another at Peake’s Wharf), one in Gateway Village (at the
north end of Confederation Bridge), another onboard the Caribou–Wood Islands ferry,
and others as far away as Park City (Utah).
The ice cream may be traditional, but the associated COWS fashion line is anything
but — the distinctive and colorful T-shirts make a wonderful souvenir. Look for them
in all COWS stores or purchase online at www.cows.ca.

A pound of mussels costs C$10 to C$12, with fries cut from Island potatoes
and a freshly baked baguette extra. And if you’ve always wondered what
a growing mussel looks like, check out the Mussel Cam at www.flex

Second-year students at the highly regarded Culinary Institute of Canada

as part of their training at this large restaurant. Dining here is a wonderful
opportunity to enjoy fine food at reasonable prices. Snag a window seat
to enjoy views that extend over Charlottetown Harbour. The menu
changes each semester and is based on seasonal specialties, such as
Cornish game hen in the fall. Seafood chowder is a thankful staple. End
your meal with one of the extravagant desserts.

CONTEMPORARY
The bland-looking Confederation Centre of the Arts is hiding a surprise.
Mavor’s is an ultra-slick bistro where the lunchtime fare includes sweet-
potato fries served with sides of sour cream and chipotle dip (a personal
favorite), salmon burger topped with mango tartar sauce, and smoked
salmon linguine. Dinner mains include grilled arctic char, a northern deli-
cacy not found in many Island restaurants. This listing gives you the
kitchen hours, but you can order Starbucks coffee daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
complete with the fancy names and wireless Internet.

GREEK
Meeko’s has the best Greek food on Prince Edward Island, served in a
nationalistic blue-and-white room with murals on the walls and mellow

choosing a tzatziki-and-mousakka combo, which sets you back just C$20.
The same menu is offered all day, with well-priced salad and sandwich
choices at lunchtime.

PUB FARE
In an 1850s building across from Confederation Landing Park, the
Merchantman is a typical British-style pub — think dim lighting, exposed
beams, and red-brick walls — with an ambitious selection of food that goes
well beyond the traditional bangers and mash. You can order all sorts of
fresh seafood, chicken, and steaks, some prepared with Cajun or Asian
influences. While researching this edition I ordered pan-fried haddock
smothered in zucchini relish followed by bourbon chocolate pecan pie, a
delicious combination that came to around C$20.

PUB FARE/SEAFOOD
Peake’s Quay offers a wonderful waterfront location and well-priced food,
though the service is not exactly stellar. This restaurant-cum-bar takes full
advantage of its upstairs location with garage-style doors opening to a 200-
seat deck overlooking the marina. While waiting for their meals, many
diners gravitate to the Marine Touch Tank, where you can get up close and
personal with local sealife. The menu mixes regular pub food with
Maritimes staples like seafood chowder served in a bread bowl, lobster
rolls, and a boiled lobster that comes with all the usual trimmings.
Desserts are all around C$6, or head to the COWS ice-cream shop directly
below for a scoop to go.

Disguised as a little shop at the corner of Water and Prince streets, this
local favorite dishes up the freshest seafood at very reasonable prices.
While not particularly creative, the menu covers all the familiar choices,
including boiled lobster dinners (different sizes for different appetites),
Malpeque oysters, steamed mussels, and seafood chowder. The patio is a
popular spot on warm evenings, but this friendly restaurant draws a crowd
throughout its limited season.

Exploring Charlottetown
As the provincial capital, Charlottetown has a number of major attrac-
tions. Most notable among them are Founders’ Hall and Province House,
both of particular interest to Canadians. One thing that everyone must
Chapter 18: Charlottetown 253

do in Charlottetown is stroll through the narrow streets between
Province House and the waterfront, where the mix of residential and
commercial architecture has remained unchanged for over a century.
Beaconsfield Historic House
Downtown
Built in 1877 for local shipbuilder James Peake Jr., this gracious home is
one of the finest pre-1900 residences on the Island. From the street, the
sharp yellow exterior and gingerbread trim catches your eye. Inside are
an impressive 25 rooms and eight fireplaces. The first two of three floors
are furnished, while a narrow stairway leads to the belvedere, a turret with
water views. Special events include musical performances and a weekday
children’s program in the adjacent carriage house. The on-site bookstore
has a solid collection of Island literature.
See map p. 246. 2 Kent St. (at West Street). % 902-368-6603. Admission: C$4.25 adults.
Open: July–Aug daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Confederation Centre of the Arts
Downtown
This large, boxy structure in the heart of downtown is at odds with sur-
rounding historic buildings, but once inside, you’ll find many redeeming
features, including the largest art gallery east of Montreal. The
Confederation Centre Art Gallery is highlighted by the luminaries of
Canadian art through the last 200 years. Many of the names won’t be famil-
iar (even to most Canadians), but Gordon Smith sculptures, paintings by
the husband-and-wife team of Christopher and Mary Pratt, and an exten-
sive collection of Robert Harris paintings (his most famous work, the offi-
cial portrait of the Fathers of Confederation, was destroyed by fire in 1916)
are standouts. The center also has three theaters (see “Nightlife” later in
this chapter), a large library with the original manuscript for Anne of Green
Gables, a craft shop, a memorial hall, and a cafe. Through summer, it hosts
the Charlottetown Festival, which includes daily lunchtime entertainment
at an amphitheater by the main entrance.
See map p. 246. 145 Richmond St. % 902-566-1267. www.confederation
centre.com. Gallery admission: Donation. Gallery hours: June–Sept daily 9 a.m.–
5 p.m.; Oct–May Wed–Sat 11 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 1–5 p.m.
Founders’ Hall
Downtown
Using innovative state-of-the-art displays, this attraction transports visi-
tors back in time to the 1864 Charlottetown Conference. It’s contained
within a historic railway building just steps from where the Fathers of
Confederation stepped ashore on the Charlottetown waterfront. You begin
your journey by entering the Time Tunnel, stepping back to life in the
1860s. The tunnel opens to the octagonal Hall of the Fathers, which
describes the men who met to discuss the formation of the country.
Part V: Prince Edward Island 
254

Beyond this exhibit is a string of rooms, each dedicated to a province or
territory, linking up in the order they joined the Dominion of Canada. Along
the way, televisions, computer terminals, headsets, trivia games, and
dynamic audiovisual displays enhance the story. Note that the hours
change depending on the time of year, so best to call ahead, especially out-
side of high season.
See map p. 246. 6 Prince St. % 902-368-1864. www.foundershall.ca. Admission:

p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–4 p.m.; July–Aug Mon–Sat until 7 p.m.
Government House and Victoria Park
Downtown
Perched on a slight rise at the edge of downtown, the 1835 Government
House is the official residence of the lieutenant governor. The grounds are
not open to the public, but the grand mansion is clearly visible through
stands of mature white birch.
Beyond Government House, Kent Street passes through Victoria Park, a
pleasant green space that ends at the shoreline of Charlottetown Harbour.
The best way to enjoy the park is on foot (although you’ll be passed by a
stream of jogging, skating, and biking locals). Near the entrance to the
park, a row of six antique cannons points to the harbor entrance.
See map p. 246. Take Kent Street southwest through downtown.
Province House
Downtown
Still the seat of the provincial legislature, Province House is where the
Fathers of Confederation met in 1864 to discuss the formation of the
Dominion of Canada. This landmark meeting took place in the second-floor
chamber, which has been restored to the way it looked back then, right
down to the original furniture, and has an adjacent clerk’s office and
library. Also on the second floor is the current Legislative Chamber, a
smallish room that looks to have changed little in well over a century.
Chapter 18: Charlottetown 255
Walk the walk
Joining a walking tour with the Confederation Players (% 800-955-1864 or 902-
368-1864), a group of eager young locals dressed in Confederation-era garb, is a great
way to learn a little about Charlottetown while taking advantage of warm summer tem-
peratures. Choose from three tours: a trip back in time along Great George Street; the
Settlers Tour, which recounts locals of note; or Ghostly Realm, an evening stroll
through cemeteries and back alleys. All depart Founders’ Hall in July and August once
or twice daily and cost C$10 adults, C$5 children. Historical reenactments on the steps
of Province House (July–Aug daily at 2:30 p.m.; free) are part of the same program.

Traditions are well entrenched here — the premier gets a small flag on his
desk and the ruling party is always seated on the south side of the room,
a throwback to the days before central heating when the afternoon sun
warmed only this part of the chamber. You can walk through by yourself,
but I highly recommend the guided tour.

St. Dunstan’s Basilica
Downtown
Distinctive for its twin Gothic spires, St. Dunstan’s Basilica is one of
Canada’s largest churches. The interior is notable for its intricate vaulted
ceiling, ornate Italian carvings, and polished marble columns.

8 a.m.–5 p.m.
Other cool things to see and do
When you’ve had your fill of downtown attractions, and are ready for
other diversions or sights lying beyond city limits, here are a few 
possibilities:
 Peake’s Wharf Boat Cruises (% 902-566-4458), departs from
Peake’s Wharf on Water Street June through September. Choose
from harbor tours with full commentaries (1, 6:30, and 8 p.m.; C$18)
or a seal-watching excursion (2:30 p.m.; C$25).
 Charlottetown Farmers Market, 100 Belvedere Ave. (% 902-626-
3373), opposite the university. Vendors at this indoor market sell
everything from fresh seafood to Island-made crafts. It operates
year-round Saturday 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., as well as Wednesday 9 a.m.
to 2 p.m. in summer.
 Orwell Corner Historic Village, 30km/19 miles east of
Charlottetown (% 902-651-8510). Experience life in the 1850s at
this restored farming community. The village is open late May
through mid-October Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., plus week-
ends in July and August. Admission is C$7.50 adults, C$3 children.
 Port-la-Joye–Fort Amherst National Historic Site, a pleasant 35-
minute drive west, and then south, from downtown (% 902-566-
7626). Not much remains of the island’s first European settlement,
which was established in 1720, but a visitor center (mid-June
through Aug daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.) at the site tells its story. The sur-
rounding grounds, overlooking the water, are a great place for a
picnic.

Shopping
As the hub of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown shops cater well to
the needs of Islanders, with a nod to the tourists down on the waterfront
along Water Street. For mall shopping, head north from downtown along
University Avenue. Here are some of my favorite shops in Charlottetown
(in no particular order):
 Anne of Green Gables Chocolates (102 Queen St.; % 902-368-
3131) is the place for sweet tooths to pick up edible souvenirs.
 Island Crafts Shop (156 Richmond St.; % 902-892-5152) is crammed
with arts and crafts, including woodwork and weaved items.
 Details Past and Present (166 Richmond St.; % 902-892-2233) dis-
plays fine art in the front and an eclectic range of antiques out
back.
 Pilar Shephard Art Gallery (82 Great George St.; % 902-892-1953)
is another fine-art gallery. It features Island landscapes and Inuit
sculptures.
 The Bookman (177 Queen St.; % 902-892-8872) holds an impres-
sive collection of used books, including many related to island his-
tory.
 Moonsnail Soapworks (85 Water St.; % 902-892-7627) specializes
in handmade soaps and other body treats made with natural ingre-
dients.
 PEI Specialty Chip Co. is based in Marshfield, northeast of
Charlottetown (% 902-629-1818), but look for their lobster-
flavored potato chips at retail outlets throughout the city.
 Canada Eh?, in Founders’ Hall (6 Prince St.; % 902-368-1864), is
crammed with Canadian souvenirs — maple syrup, smoked
salmon, wooden fishermen, Canadian flag kites, and more.
Nightlife
No one can ever describe Charlottetown as a hotbed of after-dark action,
but still, something is usually going on somewhere.
The Buzz is a free publication with listings of what’s happening through-
out Charlottetown. It comes out monthly, or check the online version at
www.isn.net/buzzon. The Web site www.walkandseacharlottetown.

Pubs and clubs
Victoria Row, a short section of Richmond Street between Queen and
Great George streets, is designated as pedestrian-only through summer.
The local restaurants and bars set tables out across the sidewalk and
some have live music.
Most pubs open at 11 a.m. and close at midnight through the week, and
at 1 a.m. on weekends.
Around the corner from Victoria Row, the Olde Dublin Pub, 131 Sydney
St. (% 902-892-6992) is a lively Celtic-styled bar, with live Maritimes
music on weekends and always with pints of Guinness. In the same vicin-
ity, Gahan House, 126 Sydney St. (% 902-626-2337) is PEI’s only brew-
pub — and it’s a good one. Six ales are brewed in-house, including
Sydney Street Stout, which gets rave reviews. The food is also a cut
above pub grub (the beer-battered haddock and thick-cut chips are deli-
cious). Named for one of the delegates at the Charlottetown Conference,
D’Arcy McGee’s sits in the heart of the city at the corner Prince and
Kent streets (% 902-894-3627). Inside is a fun and fittingly British
atmosphere, with visitors and regulars mixing easily. Overlooking the
harbor, Peake’s Quay, 1 Great George St. at Water Street (% 902-368-
1330) has a slightly more touristy feel than the other places.
The club scene in Charlottetown is dominated by Myron’s, at 151 Kent
St. (% 902-892-4375), a two-story complex that books bands ranging
from rock to country Wednesday to Saturday for the downstairs stage.
The upstairs crowd is equally diverse, dancing to everything from hip-
hop to disco, Thursday through Saturday.
The arts
The Confederation Centre of the Arts, at 145 Richmond St. (% 800-
565-0278 or 902-628-1864; www.confederationcentre.com) hosts the
Charlottetown Festival June through September. This theatrical event
combines outdoor performances, a children’s theater, and two or three
musical productions. The star of the show is Anne of Green Gables —
The Musical, a family-oriented production that brings Lucy Maud
Montgomery’s most famous character to life. Showtime is Monday to
Saturday at 8 p.m. with additional 2 p.m. matinees in July and August on
Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. Expect to pay C$21 to C$64 adults,
half price for children.
Harness racing
Harness racing has been a tradition in the capital since 1889, when
Charlottetown Driving Park Entertainment Centre, 46 Kensington Rd.
(% 902-892-6823) hosted its first races. Most race-goers attend the facil-
ity to gamble, so the operators welcome them with open arms — letting
everyone in for free. Races are held on Saturdays May through January
as well as Thursdays in summer; race time is 7:30 p.m. (call to confirm
the schedule or visit the Web site www.cdpec.ca).

C
avendish is known worldwide through the writing of Lucy Maud
Montgomery, who used her childhood on the idyllic Island setting
as inspiration for her timeless tale, Anne of Green Gables. The setting for
the book was Green Gables, a farmhouse now protected as a National
Historic Site, which, along with other spots related to the author and her
writing, keep fans of Anne occupied for at least a full day.
The tranquility of the “Avonlea” that Montgomery wrote about so
floridly has mostly gone, thanks somewhat ironically to the popularity of
the book. Cavendish’s main thoroughfare is lined with theme parks,
accommodations, and other touristy offerings. The only thing stopping
commercial sprawl from spreading to the adjacent coastline is Prince
Edward Island National Park, which protects long stretches of red-sand
beach and provides prime habitat for over 100 species of birds.
Cavendish has served as a summer retreat for decades. You need only to
take a drive through the rolling rural landscape, spend time down on the
beach, or walk the wooded trails to see why families return year after
year. The off season, however, really does mean lights off. November
through April almost everything is closed, including most accommoda-
tions and all the attractions and restaurants.
Getting There
Cavendish is 40km (25 miles) northwest of Charlottetown. To get there
from the capital, take Route 15 to Brackley Beach, and then head west
on Route 6; or take Route 2 west to Hunter River, followed by Route 13
north through New Glasgow.

Staying in Cavendish
As well as being inundated with visitors from around the world,
Cavendish is very popular with vacationing families from throughout the
Maritimes. For travel in July and August, reserve your accommodations
as far in advance as possible. Discounted rooms and a lack of crowds
make June and September a fine time to visit Cavendish; in early
September, it’s still warm enough to swim in the ocean, yet some rooms
are discounted up to 50 percent.
Cavendish Country Inn & Ocean Vista Cottages
$$–$$$
Cavendish
Choose between motel units, bed-and-breakfast rooms, or lovely wooden
cottages at this sprawling resort within walking distance of both the
national park and Cavendish. The cottages (from C$165) are the best value.
Each has a deck with outdoor furniture and a barbecue, while inside, lots
of polished wood and comfortable furnishings create an inviting atmos-
phere. Also on the property is a playground, two outdoor heated pools,
and two hot tubs.

Kindred Spirits Country Inn and Cottages
$$$–$$$$
Cavendish
In the heart of Cavendish, but set well away from the busy main road, this
delightful country estate is a world away from the rest of the bustling vil-
lage. Green Gables Heritage Site is reached along Lover’s Lane, a walking
trail that remains exactly as described by Montgomery in Anne of Green
Gables. The local golf course is even closer. Guest rooms in the inn are
country cozy and loaded with local antiques. Three price levels are
offered: The lower-priced rooms include all the basics, although more
expensive rooms add a balcony and a fireplace. Surrounding the inn are
14 upscale cottages, each with kitchen, color TV, and a deck with a bar-
becue. The most expensive cottages have a king-size bed, air-condition-
ing, fireplace, and hot tub. Regardless of the type of accommodations they
choose, all guests can enjoy the playground area, outdoor heated pool,
bike rentals, and wireless Internet.

Lakeview Lodge & Cottages
$$–$$$$
Cavendish
Close to everything, this large property with beautifully manicured
grounds features a heated outdoor pool, a barbecue area, a playground,
and a variety of room choices. Basic motel rooms cost under C$100. From
June to September, the kitchen-equipped duplex cottages, with up to four
bedrooms each, offer the best value for larger groups. Free-standing exec-
utive cottages, each with a kitchen and private deck, are a step up in qual-
ity (and price) while two modern suites in the main lodge are also well
priced. In June and September, Lakeview has great off-season specials with
rates reduced by up to 50 percent.

Parkview Farms
$$$–$$$$
Cavendish
Located 2km (11⁄4 miles) east of Cavendish, Parkview attracts the same
vacationing families as the other cottage resorts along this stretch of the
coast, but has the added attraction of being a working farm. Guests are
invited to tour the property, and can even help out with milking cows if so
inclined. Accommodations are in modern two- and three-bedroom cot-
tages, each with a well-equipped kitchen and spacious living area. Take
advantage of the barbecues supplied by purchasing fresh seafood at
Doiron Fisheries (see the sidebar “Lovin’ lobster” later on in this chapter).

Dining in Cavendish
The Cavendish dining scene reflects many of the local accommodations —
touristy, mostly overpriced, and always busy. Thankfully, a number of
alternatives lie in surrounding villages.
Blue Mussel Café
$$–$$$
North Rustico Harbour
SEAFOOD
My favorite dining spot on all of Prince Edward Island is the Blue Mussel
Café. The cafe is terribly small, but that’s a good thing if you manage to
get a table. Most of the seating is outside, on an old dock that catches the
evening sun and has views extending back down the harbor. You can’t go
wrong with any of the seafood, like creamy chowder or lobster pâté to
Chapter 19: Cavendish 263

start, followed by a full lobster or poached fish, such as haddock or
salmon. Best of all, the Blue Mussel must be one of the few seafood restau-
rants anywhere in the Maritimes without a deep fryer.
See map p. 261. 312 Harbourview Dr., North Rustico Harbour. % 902-963-2152. Main
courses: C$13–C$21. Open: Late June to Sept daily 11:30 a.m.–8 p.m.
Fisherman’s Wharf Lobster Supper
$$
North Rustico
SEAFOOD
A little more commercialized than the New Glasgow Lobster Suppers (see
a bit later in this chapter), the North Rustico version is otherwise very
similar. Up to 500 diners can be seated at once in the cavernous restau-
rant, which is lined on one side by a long buffet of hot and cold appetizers
and desserts. Tables feature paper place mats that describe how lobsters
are caught and, more importantly, the best way to eat them.
See map p. 261. Route 6, North Rustico. % 877-289-1010 or 902-963-2669. Lobster
supper from C$32. AE, MC, V. Open: Mid-May to mid-Oct daily noon to 9 p.m.
Friendly Fisherman
$$
Cavendish
BUFFET
I wanted to include at least one restaurant in the town of Cavendish, so 
I joined the throngs of families and entered the fray to research the
Friendly Fisherman, right at the town’s main intersection. (It was friendly
enough, but not a fisherman was in sight.) Because this buffet restaurant

Lovin’ lobster
Believe it or not, it wasn’t that long ago that the supply of lobster exceeded demand
so much that Islanders used it as fertilizer. Things have changed, though; lobster is
now promoted as a delicacy across the Maritimes. The trapping season for lobsters
is short, but the lobsters are held live in holding tanks so they can be offered fresh
year-round.
Lobsters served in restaurants and at lobster suppers usually weigh around one pound,
which provides enough of the rich meat for most people. They are generally served
whole, challenging diners to extract as much of the meat as they can using fingers, lob-
ster crackers, and skewers. It can be a messy process, so most places — even
upscale restaurants — supply a bib.
One of the best things about lobster is that it tastes best simply boiled, which means you
can do the cooking yourself (many accommodations provide big pots especially for this
purpose). Doiron Fisheries, on the dock at North Rustico (% 902-963-2442), is the best
place around Cavendish to buy lobster. Expect to pay around C$12 per pound, live or
precooked. This seafood market is also the place to pick up Malpeque Bay oysters,
mussels, clams, and fresh fish. It’s open May to early October, daily 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

is perpetually busy, the turnover of food is fast, which keeps the salads
fresh and the hot food hot. Seafood is limited to a lasagna and a couple of
baked fish dishes, but you have plenty of other choices, including roast
beef. Beer and wine are extra, but well priced. Pay for a ticket at the front
door and wait your turn for a table. Children pay C$1 for every year of age.
Breakfast and lunch are served cafeteria-style.
See map p. 261. 8258 Cavendish Rd. (Route 6), Cavendish. % 866-963-2234 or 902-963-
2234. Buffet dinner: C$15. AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mid-June to mid-Oct daily 8 a.m.–
9 p.m. (buffet served from 4 p.m.)
New Glasgow Lobster Suppers
$$
New Glasgow
SEAFOOD
Held in community halls and restaurants throughout the province, lobster
suppers are informal, fun, and good value. The one at New Glasgow is the
oldest, having been in operation since 1958. Here, up to 500 diners can be
seated at once in a two-level riverside building with its own lobster hold-
ing pond. Choose the size of lobster you want (1–4 pounds) and enjoy all-
you-can-eat chowder, mussels, salad, breads, desserts, and non-alcoholic
beverages for a set price. If you want to pass on the lobster as a main,
breaded scallops, haddock, and roast beef are offered as alternatives.
Children under 12 get their own menu, which includes a lobster supper
for C$14, and kids under 3 eat for free. To get to New Glasgow, take Route
13 southeast from Cavendish. The big building is impossible to miss across
the river in New Glasgow.

Open: June to mid-Oct daily 4–8:30 p.m.
Exploring Cavendish
The sites associated with Anne of Green Gables are somewhat overshad-
owed by amusement parks and tacky tourist traps (although you won’t
hear any complaints from children). I divide this section up accordingly,
with some suggestions for touring beyond Cavendish sandwiched in
between.
Anne attractions
Separating fact from fiction is somewhat difficult when it comes to visit-
ing the childhood haunts of Lucy Maud Montgomery. Many of these
places ended up in her famous novels and are now shrines visited by
fans from around the world.
Anne of Green Gables Museum
Park Corner
Owned and operated by relatives of Montgomery, this museum is housed
at Silver Bush, a name given to the home of the Campbell family who
Chapter 19: Cavendish 265

appear in two of her novels. The residence is decked out in period fur-
nishings and a selection of the author’s personal belongings is on display.
The parlor, where Montgomery was married in 1911, is now a popular spot
for Japanese couples to say their vows. You can relax in the small tearoom,
which serves hot drinks and homemade goodies, or enjoy a carriage ride
(C$10 per family) along the nearby beach.
Route 20, 24km (15 miles) west of Cavendish in Park Corner. % 902-886-2884.
Admission: C$2.50 adults, C$1 children. Open: May–Oct daily 11 a.m.–4 p.m., extended
hours July–Aug daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Avonlea
Cavendish
Of the many amusement parks in Cavendish, only Avonlea, which recon-
structs Montgomery’s version of rural PEI, has any connection to the book
Anne of Green Gables. The park comprises a general store, a church, farm
animals, old-fashioned games, themed rides, and a chocolate factory
(which wasn’t in the book, but is a popular spot nevertheless). Throughout
the day, costumed performers go about their business: milking cows, lead-
ing pony rides, giving dance lessons — and did I mention the chocolate
factory?
See map p. 261. Route 6, Cavendish. % 902-963-3050. Admission: C$19 adults, C$18
seniors, C$16 children 6–12. Open: June daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m., July–Aug daily 10 a.m.–
6 p.m.
Part V: Prince Edward Island 
266
Anne’s land
Anne of Green Gables chronicles the life of Anne Shirley, a lovable character created
by one of Canada’s best-known authors, Lucy Maud Montgomery (1874–1942).
Although the enduring tale of the red-haired orphan girl and her life at Avonlea is fic-
tional, it draws on Montgomery’s own experiences growing up in her grandparents’
Cavendish home and spending her younger days exploring the rural surroundings.
On the Island, the tale has spawned an entire industry. Anne of Green Gables has been
translated into dozens of languages and has been reprinted over 100 times. The char-
acter of Anne has been re-created in a musical and television drama. Half a world
away, it’s even part of the official curriculum in Japanese schools — and hence
Cavendish receives large numbers of Japanese visitors.
If you’re an Anne fan, plan your time in Cavendish to coincide with the L.M. Montgomery
Festival (www.lmmontgomeryfestival.com), held annually on the second week-
end of July. Festivities include readings, a coloring competition at the local school-
house, and afternoon high tea served outdoors at the site of Montgomery’s childhood
home.

Green Gables
Cavendish
Within easy walking distance of Montgomery’s childhood home is Green
Gables, which belonged to her grandfather’s cousins. Anchoring Lucy
Maud Montgomery Cavendish National Historic Site, this green-and-white
farmhouse served as the setting for Anne of Green Gables. At the main
entrance is an interpretive center; inside the picket fence, rooms in the
main house have been restored and the barn re-creates early farm life. Two
of the most loved connections between the property and the book are
Haunted Wood and Balsam Hollow, reached by short trails from the house.

adults, C$5.90 seniors, C$3.45 children. Open: May–Oct daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m., extended
hours July–Aug daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.
Lucy Maud Montgomery Birthplace
New London
This unassuming home is where the writer was born in 1874. The interior
is decorated in corresponding Victorian style. Among personal effects on
display are a replica of Montgomery’s wedding dress, as well as scrap-
books she put together as a child.
New London, southwest of Cavendish on Route 6. % 902-886-2099. Admission: C$3
adults, C50¢ children. Open: Mid-May to mid-Oct daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
Site of Lucy Maud Montgomery’s Cavendish Home
Cavendish
This is where the writer lived with her grandparents after the premature
death of her mother. All that remains of the home are the foundations, but
the well-tended gardens and mature groves of apple trees provide a peace-
ful retreat from the rest of Cavendish. A small museum and bookstore at
the site are operated by members of Montgomery’s family.

July–Aug daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.
Cool things for kids to do in Cavendish
Amusement park-style attractions open June through September are
strung out along Route 6 between Cavendish and Stanley Bridge. They
strongly contrast the idyllic Avonlea so loved by Anne fans — but chil-
dren love them. Here’s just a sampling:
 Sandspit (% 902-963-2626) has old-time fairground rides, includ-
ing a roller coaster, carousel, and Ferris wheel, as well as bumper
boats, a miniature railway, and go-carts.
Chapter 19: Cavendish 267

 Shining Waters Family Fun Park (% 902-963-3939) features rides
for younger children and is extremely popular on hotter days for its
waterslides.
 Mariner’s Cove (% 902-963-2242) is the most challenging of
Cavendish’s many minigolf courses.
 Black Magic (% 902-963-2889) is minigolf with a twist — indoors
and in the dark.
Touring Beyond Cavendish
After you manage to pry the Anne fan in your family away from
Cavendish, you’ll discover that the surrounding area is well worth
exploring. Take a walk from the village to the natural, rugged beauty of
Cavendish’s coast or drive east along the shoreline to Tracadie Bay and
loop back on Route 6 to take in a mix of coastal and rural scenery.
Prince Edward Island National Park
This narrow park protects a sliver of coastline extending from London
Bay in the west to Tracadie Bay in the east, as well as a separate chunk
of coastline farther east near St. Peters. The park encompasses a varied
landscape with wide beaches, attractive red sandstone cliffs, and rolling
dunes. It can be accessed from seven different points along Route 6.
Swimming and sunbathing are the big summertime attractions for most
visitors. The water is warm enough for swimming in July and August.
Trained supervisors watch out for the well-being of those who take to
the water at the busiest spots. The best — and busiest — beaches are
those near Cavendish.
Gulf Shore Road, which begins as a northern extension of Route 13
through Cavendish, hugs the coastline, passing more park beaches,
numerous lookouts (Orby Head is my fave), and a pretty picnic area at
Cape Turner.
The section of park east of Rustico Bay is a lot quieter. Here you can enjoy
a long beach walk, or take a morning stroll along the marshland behind
the dunes in search of local birds, such as piping plovers and northern
phalarope. Brackley Beach, at the north end of Route 15, has supervised
swimming, change rooms, a concession, and an information center.
Rise early to experience Prince Edward Island National Park in its most
picturesque and pristine state. Overnight, wind and water action creates
textured herringbone patterns across the beaches and dunes, and the
rising sun casts an intriguing red glow across the entire park.
A National Park Day Pass costs C$6.90 adults, C$5.90 seniors, C$3.45 chil-
dren, to a maximum of C$17 per vehicle. Cavendish Visitor Centre, just
north of the junction of routes 6 and 13 in Cavendish (% 902-963-2391),
Part V: Prince Edward Island 
268

has park maps, posted weather forecasts, and natural history displays.
It’s open June through September daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (July and Aug
until 8 p.m.).
North Rustico Harbour
At the entrance to Rustico Bay, the tiny hamlet of North Rustico Harbour
comprises a lighthouse and a smattering of trim homes lodged between
the beaches of Prince Edward Island National Park and a small harbor
packed with fishing boats. The picturesque setting attracts hordes of vis-
itors, but somehow the village maintains a peaceful demeanor.
Down on the dock is Rustico Harbour Fisheries Museum (% 902-963-
3799), a small facility that catalogs local history. Native displays share
space with exhibits on harvesting Irish moss, artifacts from local canner-
ies, and a tank of live lobsters. The story of the Mi’Kmaq, who left mid-
dens of shells on nearby Robinsons Island as evidence of 1,500 years of
habitation, is most intriguing. Admission is a worthwhile C$3 adults,
C$2.50 seniors and children.
Court Brothers (% 902-963-2322) is one of many local operations that
take visitors out to sea for mackerel fishing. Trips last around three
hours and cost a reasonable C$25 adults and C$15 children, although the
catch belongs to the boat. Outside Expeditions (% 800-207-3899 or
902-963-3366; www.getoutside.com) launches sea kayak tours from a
beach right beside the dock. If you’ve never kayaked before, the 90-
minute trip is a great introduction to the sport. The cost is just C$45 per
person and includes instruction in basic paddling skills and the chance
to view a wide range of seabirds while paddling along the calm waters of
the bay. If you’re feeling adventurous, consider a day trip to Robinsons
Island, where a picnic lunch is included in the price of C$100.
To get to North Rustico Harbour, take Route 6 east from Cavendish and
veer left at the main intersection in North Rustico.
Chapter 19: Cavendish 269
Starving art lovers, tuck in!
If not the most notable Island gallery, then The Dunes Studio Gallery & Cafe, on Route
15 at Brackley Beach (% 902-672-1883), is certainly the most unique. Made up almost
entirely of windows, this ultra-contemporary building is part gallery, part restaurant,
and all tourist attraction. The Island’s preeminent painters, woodcarvers, and sculp-
tors have their work on display in a multi-level, spiral room, with a narrow stairway
leading to a fourth-floor lookout. Hungry? The gallery restaurant outdoes itself with
dishes such as crab cakes with wasabi mayonnaise (C$14) at lunch and a roasted pork
tenderloin with rosemary apricot mustard in the evening (C$25). The gallery is open
May through September daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. while the restaurant hours are June to
September daily 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m

M
any visitors only tour the central portion (Queens County) of
Prince Edward Island — they cross Confederation Bridge and
head straight for Charlottetown, and then venture north to Cavendish
and maybe loop through Kings County before leaving via the ferry. But,
to experience the Island’s less touristy side, consider including Prince
County, the western third of the island, in your itinerary.
The low-lying landscape of Prince County is mostly rural. It’s surrounded
by some of the Maritimes’ best beaches, long sand dunes, and low, red
cliffs. To appreciate the best of the west, stick to the coast wherever
possible (Route 14 between West Point and Tignish is the highlight) and
give the main thoroughfare — Route 2, which runs through the middle of
Prince County — a miss.
Summerside
Summerside (population 15,000), 71km (44 miles) west of Charlottetown,
is the second-largest city on Prince Edward Island and is the gateway to
Prince County. Spread around a south-facing harbor, the waterfront is
the most appealing section of the city, although a recent rejuvenation
extends to commercial buildings adorned with colorful murals.
Getting there
From the Confederation Bridge, take Route 10, and then Route 1A, to
reach Summerside in less than 30 minutes. The most direct route from
Charlottetown is Route 2 through Kensington. Both these routes merge
east of Summerside, with a well-signposted exit leading right downtown.

Staying in Summerside
A strip of motels on the eastern approach to downtown (within walking
distance of the waterfront) offers well-priced overnight accommoda-
tions — just don’t expect valet parking and room service.
Baker’s Lighthouse Motel

Summerside
Rooms at Baker’s Lighthouse Motel are no better than similarly priced

ground while you cook up a storm (or a lobster — pots supplied) at the
outdoor barbecue area.

This college, the only one of its type in North America, is for people who

Celtic Festival is a great chance to learn about ancient Celtic culture and
the skills involved in the various disciplines taught on campus. Mini-
concerts are held Monday to Friday at 11:30 a.m., 1:30 p.m., and 3:30 p.m.
Admission is C$5 per person. July through August, Tuesday, Wednesday,

Région Évangéline
The Acadians comprised the first group of Europeans to settle on Prince
Edward Island. When the British took control of the island in 1755, many
of these French nationals escaped exile by hiding out in the remote west-
ern portion of the island. Over time, they resumed normal, mostly rural
lives. Their descendants now make up over 15 percent of the island’s
population and are concentrated along the portion of the island covered
in this next section — the southern coastline of Prince County, west of
Summerside along Route 11.
Getting there
Route 2 west from Summerside flies right through the middle of Région
Évangéline. You can take Route 11 south at Miscouche to follow the
Part V: Prince Edward Island 
272

coast to Cap Egmont for more scenic views, and then rejoin Route 2 at
Mount Pleasant. But plan on staying in Summerside or Charlottetown for
the night, as decent accommodations and dining options are very lim-
ited here.
Exploring Région Évangéline
Trim homes, impressive churches, and flapping flags are signs that pride
in Acadian culture is strong in Région Évangéline. Traditions are also
showcased at Musée Acadien — and I include an eccentric non-Acadian
sight as a bonus.
Bottle Houses
Cap Egmont
Think you know the world’s most obsessive collector? Think again.
Originally put together by the late Edouard Arsenault, over 25,000 bottles
have been cemented together to form three buildings, including a church
complete with altar and pews, at this unique attraction. The surrounding
gardens alone are worth the price of admission.
Route 11, Cap Egmont. % 902-854-2987. Admission: C$5 adults, C$4.50 seniors, C$2

Musée Acadien
Miscouche
Protected as a National Historic Site, this museum commemorates the
trials and tribulations of the Island’s early French settlers. It boasts a per-
manent display of Acadian history, as well a remarkable audiovisual pres-
entation that tells the story of their mass expulsion from Prince Edward
Island in moving detail. Acadians gathered in Miscouche in 1884 to offi-
cially adopt the Acadian flag and an anthem, which gives the museum
extra appeal.

Our Lady of Mont-Carmel
Mont-Carmel
Facing the highway, but sitting atop red cliffs that descend to
Northumberland Strait, this magnificent church is the architectural high-
light of Région Évangéline. The town’s first inhabitants came from the
Poitou region of France, and this is reflected in the cathedral’s ornate inte-
rior. Most visitors are happy to do their admiring from the surrounding
grounds, but Sunday Mass is open to the public.

Malpeque Bay
The calm waters of Malpeque Bay are famous for oysters, but the area’s
pleasant beaches, its human history, and its native culture make this
massive tidal waterway a worthwhile detour from the drive north
through Prince County.
Getting there
If you’re coming from Cavendish, follow Route 6 through to Kensington,
and then take Route 20 north to Cabot Beach or Route 2 around the
head of the bay. Tyne Valley, on the western side of the bay, is reached
by taking Route 132 from Route 2.
Staying around Malpeque Bay
Lodging around Malpeque Bay is limited, so reserve a room well ahead
of time, especially for July and August.
Doctor’s Inn Bed and Breakfast

Tyne Valley
On a rise above the village of Tyne Valley, this rambling 1860s home is
more farm than bed-and-breakfast. It contains only two guest rooms and a
single guest bathroom, but you’ll remember hospitable hosts Jean and
Paul Offer and their wonderful down-home cooking long after you’ve
gotten over having to share a bathroom. A full cooked breakfast, prepared
in the old-fashioned kitchen complete with wood stove, is included in the
rates. If you choose to pay the C$55 per person extra for the four-course
dinner, you’ll enjoy appetizers and wine in the sitting room, followed by
seafood complemented by wonderful salads in the dining room. Freshly
baked desserts complete the cozy dining experience. Non-guests are also

warm water for swimming, but is also close to Cavendish, while a ten-
minute drive southeast is the Kensington Towers theme park. Each
modern, woodsy cottage has two to three bedrooms, a full kitchen, color
television, and deck. In July and August a three-night minimum stay is
required, but in spring and as early as late August, this condition is
dropped and cabins rent from just C$101 per night.

other in just two hours.
Lennox Island
North Malpeque Bay
The Mi’Kmaq, the original inhabitants of Prince Edward Island, had their
10,000-year nomadic lifestyle wiped out after Europeans arrived and
cleared the land for farming. Around 1800, some had been persuaded to
resettle on Lennox Island, which was later purchased for their people. Now
linked to PEI by a short causeway, descendants of the Mi’Kmaq still live
on the island, living a mostly traditional lifestyle that includes fishing and
harvesting peat moss. They share their culture with interested visitors 
at Lennox Island Cultural Centre, down by the main dock (% 902-831-
2702). Official summer hours are daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., but call ahead to
confirm. Across the road is Indian Art & Craft of North America (% 902-
831-2653) where you can purchase Mi’Kmaq baskets, pottery, and jewelry.
Take Route 163 east from Route 12.
Green Park Shipbuilding Museum
Port Hill
If you want to revisit the 1860s, when shipbuilding was Prince Edward
Island’s main industry, plan on a visit to this sprawling property on the
western shore of Malpeque Bay. The mansion of James Yeo, who owned
the yards, sits in the heart of sweeping grounds. It’s fully furnished in
Victorian style, including the top-floor cupola from which Yeo was able to
watch over his workers. If you walk down to the site of the actual ship-
yards, two wooden buildings and the slips are all that remain, although
interpretive panels do a good job of describing the once bustling business.
To get to the museum, you pass through Green Park Provincial Park, pro-
tecting a low peninsula scattered with stunted birch and laced with trails
leading along the waterfront.

Western Prince County
Western Prince County is an arrow-shaped chunk of land that comes to a
point at North Cape. Potato farms dominate the landscape in the central
portion of the region although small fishing villages and long stretches
of uninhabited coastline lined by sea cliffs beckon to the south and west.
Chapter 20: Prince County 275

Getting there
Route 2 splits western Prince County neatly in two, but steer away from
this highway and take the coastal route wherever possible.
Staying in western Prince County
The Prince Edward Island Visitors Guide lists dozens of cottage-style
accommodations, but the following three spots stand out.
Heritage Inn & Gardens
$$
Tignish
Located in the village of Tignish, this lodging is a good choice if you want
inexpensive accommodations close to the cape. Built with locally fired red
brick in 1868, a thorough renovation and the creation of beautiful gardens
has removed any clinical feel from this former convent. Seventeen simple
guest rooms are available, all with private bathrooms. Rates include a light
breakfast and use of a kitchen.

Families will love this modern resort, the largest in Prince County, for
amenities that include a waterslide and pool, canoe rentals, and hiking
trails. A bonus for golfers is one of Canada’s top-rated golf courses. The 90
guest rooms are adequate, with the choice of park or golf course views and
standard amenities that include wireless Internet and air-conditioning. Both
the main dining room and a casual bistro-cafe overlook the golf course.

one of the oldest and tallest lighthouses on the Island. It has since been
converted to an inn with a coveted Tower Room, in the lighthouse itself,
in addition to the Light Keeper’s Quarters in the adjoining building. All nine
guest rooms are furnished with handmade quilts and antiques; a restau-
rant supplies three meals daily. Book well in advance for the room of your

Touring through western Prince County
A tour through western Prince County is more about soaking up the
scenery than visiting specific sites. The following are highlights of a driv-
ing tour that follows Route 2 as far as Mill River Provincial Park, and then
continues on Route 12 to North Cape, returning along the west coast on
Route 14. This entire loop is around 400km (250 miles) and you can com-
plete it easily in one day.
 Prince Edward Island Potato Museum, in O’Leary, along Route 142
west of Route 2 (% 902-859-2039; June to mid-Oct Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–
5 p.m., Sun 1–5 p.m.). Surrounded by potato farms, exhibits at this
small museum catalog the local industry, which dates back to the
1830s when an Irish farmer planted the Island’s first spuds.
Admission is C$6 per person to a maximum of C$14 per family.
 Mill River Provincial Park, beside Route 2 at St. Anthony. This park
is best known for its golf course (% 902-859-2486), where the river
comes into play on many holes. Greens fees are a reasonable C$60.
 North Cape, 16km (10 miles) north of Tignish. Prince County nar-
rows to a point of land at North Cape, with a lighthouse and long
reef that becomes exposed at low tide. Nearby is the Atlantic Wind
Test Site, where wind turbines generate 5 percent of the Island’s
electricity.
 Elephant Rock, 4km (21⁄2 miles) north of Norway on Route 182.
Detached from high cliffs by erosion, this geological oddity lost its
“trunk” in 1998, but the pinnacle of rock and the surrounding
barren landscape are well worth the effort to reach it.
 Irish Moss Interpretive Centre, Route 14, Miminegash (% 902-882-
4313; June–Sept Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–7 p.m., Sun noon to 8 p.m.). A
type of seaweed used in the production of ice cream, Irish moss is
collected by hand and on horseback from local beaches. This small
museum, operated by families involved in the process, tells their
story. Admission is C$2. Attached to the museum is the Seaweed
Pie Café. Its namesake (C$3.50 per slice) actually tastes better than
you may think.
 West Point Lighthouse, off Route 14 (% 902-859-3605). Manned
from 1875 through to 1963, this historic structure has been con-
verted to an inn (see earlier) and restaurant, but is well worth just
a casual stop. Part of the complex is a small museum describing the
structure and its importance to shipping in Northumberland Strait.
The lighthouse is within Cedar Dunes Provincial Park, where you
can walk the wooded nature trails and try your hand at digging
clams.

Kings County
In This Chapter
 Searching out seals in southern Kings County
 Striding the fairways of Brudenell River Golf Course
 Wandering through the shifting, singing sand of northern Kings County
L
ike the rest of Prince Edward Island, Kings County is dominated by
green farmland crisscrossed by rural roads. The biggest difference
in the landscape is along the east coast, where the shoreline is more
rugged than elsewhere on the Island, as the red sea cliffs are replaced by
a rocky, forested foreshore.
The region is encircled by a coastal highway that passes through all of
the towns and parks that this chapter details. From Charlottetown, it fol-
lows the Trans-Canada Highway east to Wood Islands, the departure
point for ferries to the mainland, and then jogs north along the convo-
luted east coast before returning to the capital as Route 2. The entire
loop is 374km (232 miles), easily tackled in one day.
For the purposes of the this chapter, I break Kings County in two, with
southern Kings County and northern Kings County divided by the
Cardigan River, which runs roughly through the center of the county and
drains into Cardigan Bay just north of Brudenell River Provincial Park.
Southern Kings County
Mostly rural, the southern portion of Kings County is dotted with pictur-
esque villages, fishing ports, lighthouses, and a number of provincial
parks.
Getting there
From Charlottetown, take the Trans-Canada Highway (Route 1) east.
After 20km (12 miles), Route 3 branches east to Brudenell River while
the main highway heads south toward Wood Islands.
Between May and mid-December, ferries ply Northumberland Strait, link-
ing Caribou (Nova Scotia) with Wood Islands just across the county line

from Kings County. In summer, there are eight departures daily in each
direction. Service in spring and fall is less frequent, and ice prevents fer-
ries from operating mid-December to April. No reservations are taken, so
plan on catching a mid-week, early morning departure to avoid a long
wait. The round-trip fare of C$59 per vehicle, including passengers, is
collected upon leaving the Island. (If you drive back to the mainland via
the Confederation Bridge, a toll is collected there.) The service is oper-
ated by Northumberland Ferries (% 888-249-7245 or 902-566-3838;
www.peiferry.com).
Staying in southern Kings County
The lodging scene in southern Kings County is dominated by small bed-
and-breakfasts and family-style cottage accommodations. The following
are my faves.
Forest and Stream Cottages
$$
Murray Harbour
If you can go without room service and robes, and if you like the idea of
cooking your own meals, then this is the spot for you. Set on a small lake,
each of five standard cottages has an older but well-equipped kitchen, a
separate bedroom, and a screened porch. The Deluxe Cottage has two bed-
rooms and upgraded everything. Bed-and-breakfast rooms are also avail-
able. Guests have use of rowboats (perfect for an early morning fishing
expedition — trout for breakfast, anyone?), a hot tub, and bike rentals.
Children will love the shaded playground. Breakfast (C$5 per person) is
served on the veranda of the main house.

Roseneath
This sprawling destination resort takes prime advantage of its bayside set-
ting within the boundaries of Brudenell River Provincial Park. The
unequaled choice of activities is what makes this resort a standout — two
18-hole golf courses, indoor and outdoor pools, tennis courts, bike rentals,
canoeing and kayaking, horseback riding, and a full spa facility. Kids are
catered to with their own activity program and a children’s center. The
main lodge holds 99 spacious hotel-style guest rooms decorated in simple,
contemporary way. Each has a balcony or patio with water or golf course
vistas. Close to the main resort is a cluster of 50 Riverside Country Cabins,
which look rather boxy from the outside, but are well suited to budget
travelers. Finally, each of 32 Echelon Gold Cottages has one or two bed-
rooms outfitted with king-size beds, a jetted tub, a full-sized kitchen, and
a private deck with barbecue. Resort dining and drinking choices include
three restaurants (Stillwater has the most inviting ambience) and a pool-
side bar.

Panmure Island
The three motel-like rooms at Thought’s End are unspectacular, but the
setting is unbeatable — a 5.6-hectare (14-acre) property on remote
Panmure Island, which is east of Montague on Route 17 and linked to the
rest of PEI by a causeway. The island is ringed by beaches, and those

Dining in southern Kings County
If you’ve just docked at Wood Islands, no better introduction to the
island is better than enjoying a seafood feast — chowder, boiled lobster,
or steamed mussels — from Crabby’s Seafood, right beside the ferry
dock (% 902-962-3228; open June to September daily noon to 7 p.m.) at
one of surrounding picnic tables. Farther afield, plan on taking a full
meal at Rodd Brudenell River (see earlier), or Windows on the Water in
Montague.

Montague
CAFE/SEAFOOD
This old-fashioned eatery combines country charm with a prime water-
front location overlooking Montague Marina. You can dine inside where
the ambience is warm and inviting, but if the sun is shining dine out on the
large deck. I loved the chowder made with homemade fish stock and
chockablock full of haddock, clams, and scallops. It was lunchtime, so I
skipped the mains (whatever seafood is in season, cooked simply) and
dived straight into a generous serving of perfectly cooked apple crisp to
finish.

Exploring southern Kings County
If you’re approaching Kings County from the Trans-Canada Highway, take
the coastal route from Charlottetown to Wood Islands, where the ferry
from Nova Scotia docks. At the junction of the main highway and the
ferry access road, Wood Islands Visitor Information Centre (% 902-
962-7411; open mid-May to mid-Oct daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m.) is a good place
to find out more about the region.

East from Wood Islands
From Wood Islands, it’s 9km (51⁄2 miles) to the first worthwhile stop,
Rossignol Estate Winery on Route 4 (% 902-962-4193), the island’s only
commercial vineyard. Its eye-pleasing location above Northumberland
Strait plays second fiddle to the serious business of producing surpris-
ingly good red and white table wines, as well as award-winning fruit-
based wines and maple cider. You can try before you buy at the on-site
wine shop, which is open May to October, Monday to Saturday from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 1 to 5 p.m.

Fairways to heaven
Quietly, Prince Edward Island has become one of Canada’s premier destinations for
golfers. A solid collection of more than 20 courses makes the most of the rolling rural
landscape and picture-perfect coastline, varying from rural nine-hole courses to
world-class resort layouts. The best Island golf courses are equal in quality and chal-
lenge to any others in Canada, yet greens fees (all under C$100) are a fraction of what
you pay elsewhere.
Golf PEI (% 866-465-3734; www.golfpei.ca) is a government-operated reserva-
tion service that also promotes accommodation packages that make Island golfing an
even better deal.
Here are my favorite courses:
Belvedere (Charlottetown % 902-368-7104) is an old-fashioned layout that nurtured
LPGA star Lorie Kane.
Brudenell River (Brudenell River Provincial Park; % 800-235-8909 or 902-859-8873)
mixes tree-lined fairways with open riverfront terrain. Thinking golfers are well
rewarded at this renowned course.
Countryview (Fairview; % 902-675-2800) is a sporty nine-hole layout with water views.
It is surrounded by farmland, yet lies just ten minutes by road from Charlottetown.
Links of Crowbush Cove (Morell; % 800-235-8909 or 902-961-7300) is routed around
natural waterways behind North Shore dunes. Crowbush Cove is one of Canada’s top
courses.
Eagles Glenn (Cavendish; % 866-963-3600 or 902-963-3600), although not over-
whelming in length, is a challenging 27-hole, links-style creation through rolling high-
lands.
Glasgow Hills (Hunter River; % 866-621-2200 or 902-621-2201) is in the middle of the
Island, but the ocean is in view from its lofty location. Be prepared for major elevation
differences between tee and green.

Murray Harbour
This tiny fishing village 10km (61⁄4 miles) east of Murray River is a little
off the beaten track, but is well worth the detour. The Old General Store
(% 902-962-2459) and Miss Elly’s (% 902-962-3555), both on Main
Street, hold fine collections of antiques and gifts. Meanwhile, Marine
Adventures Seal Tours (% 902-962-2494) departs the downtown dock
up to three times daily mid-May through September for a short boat
cruise to a large colony of seals via a mussel farm. The tour costs C$19
adults, C$17 seniors, C$12 children.
Northern Kings County
If the weather is good, your time in the northern section of Kings County
will be a highlight of your visit to Prince Edward Island. The beaches
lining the Gulf of St. Lawrence are as nice as you find anywhere around
the Island, yet tourist crowds are minimal. The entire region is more
lightly settled than elsewhere in the province; the largest town, Souris,
holds a population of just 1,200.
Getting there
Route 4 is the most direct route between Pooles Corner and Souris, but
the scenic countryside on alternate routes 311 and 310 is enjoyable.
From Cavendish, Route 2 enters Kings County near St. Andrews and
veers inland to join Route 4 at Fortune Bridge. On any of these
approaches, distances are not as long as they may seem from glancing at
a provincial map. Souris is 82km (51 miles) from Charlottetown and
70km (43 miles) from Wood Islands.
Staying in northern Kings County
Accommodations in the northern half of Kings County are more spread
out than elsewhere on the Island, but the choices you do have run the
gamut of prices — from one of PEI’s best bargains to one of its most
upscale (and expensive) inns.

Built as a summer retreat for Broadway playwright Elmer Harris, Inn at Bay
Fortune is now an upscale, 18-room inn on the calm shores of Bay Fortune.
The lodge and its well-manicured grounds are rather aristocratic, and yet
the ambience remains unpretentious. The elegant rooms are furnished
with a pleasing mix of antiques and Island-made furniture; some have
wood-burning fireplaces.
The restaurant here has a reputation as one of the finest in the Maritimes.
The tables along the covered veranda provide the best views. Enjoy views

pond, the lobster may be frozen. The fixed-price meal includes a full lob-
ster, freshly baked breads, delicious fish chowder, and strawberry short-
cake for dessert.
Route 16, St. Margarets. % 902-687-3105. Lobster supper: C$28. Open: Mid-June to

Exploring northern Kings County
You can easily hit the hot spots of northern Kings County — Souris, East
Point, and the eastern end of Prince Edward Island National Park — in a
single day, including stops. The road around the peninsula is never more
than a few minutes’ drive from the water, while rural routes cut across
the entire peninsula, opening up various options for exploring the 
interior.
Souris and area
Souris (pronounced “Surrey”), 39km (24 miles) north of Pooles Corner,
has a population of just 1,100, yet is the biggest town in all of Kings
County. St. Mary’s Catholic Church, on Chapel Avenue, soars higher
than any other building in town. It was built in 1901 using red-colored
island sandstone. At the west entrance to town is a beach and a conces-
sion renting kayaks and bikes.
Around 10km (61⁄4 miles) up the coast from Souris is Basin Head
Fisheries Museum (% 902-357-7233), at the oceanfront site of an aban-
doned fish cannery. The original wooden buildings, weathered by sun
and salt, hold displays tracing the history of the industry as well as
touch tanks and exhibits describing local sea life. The museum is open
June to September daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and admission is C$4 adults,
free for children. Below the museum is Singing Sand Beach, so named
for the squeaking sound when you walk on the sand.
North Shore
The octagonal East Point Lighthouse (% 902-357-2106) stands on a low
knoll at the easternmost point of land on Prince Edward Island. Built in
1867, the timber structure is open for inspection mid-June to August

daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The attached light keeper’s residence has been
converted to a gift shop with a good selection of seafaring literature.
Take Route 313 west from St. Peters to reach the Greenwich unit of
Prince Edward Island National Park, which is dominated by massive
sand dunes. The unstable dunes are slowly moving inland, burying the
coastal woods and leaving bleached tree trunks sticking up through 
the sand. The access road ends at Greenwich Interpretation Centre
(% 902-963-2391; open mid-May to mid-Oct daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. and until
8 p.m. July–Aug) where the unique ecology of the protected peninsula is
explained. To see for yourself, take the 4.5km (2.8-mile) Greenwich
Dunes Hiking Trail. Allow 90 minutes to complete the loop. Admission
to the park is C$6.90 adults, C$5.90 seniors, C$3.45 children.

them a look. Find inspiration in Chapter 22, which condenses
the best Maritime experiences. If you want a quick reference

timers of note.

Chapter 22
Ten Maritimes Experiences
In This Chapter
 Drinking up the local culture
 Casting a line
 Watching the whales
I
n this chapter, I describe experiences that represent the best of the
Maritimes — a combination of specific destinations and things to do
throughout the three provinces.
A Day in Anne’s Land
If you’ve read Anne of Green Gables, you’ll want to spend at least a day
exploring the area around Cavendish, on Prince Edward Island — the
area Lucy Maud Montgomery waxed lyrical about in her famous novel.
You can visit Montgomery’s birthplace, stroll through the home in which
she was married (or even tie the knot yourself), and walk — or skip for
the full effect — along Lover’s Lane through Balsam Hollow.
Drinking and Dancing
Maritimers love their beer (especially local brews such as Keith’s) and
they love traditional Celtic music. Combine the two in the surroundings
of a local pub, and you’re in for an energetic night of fun. Nearly every
town throughout the region has at least one pub, each with its regular
clientele, but welcoming of visitors. A ceilidh (kay-lee) is an organized
gathering that combines the two pleasures, often in a community hall or
outdoor venue.

Fishing the Miramichi
Serious anglers from around the world are drawn to the wildly remote
Miramichi River for spring and summer runs of Atlantic salmon, weighing
up to 13 kilograms (30 pounds) each. Fish populations have increased
remarkably since a catch-and-release policy was implemented a decade
ago. Lots of fish are up for grabs, but catching them is an art. Better your
odds by hiring a local guide, many of whom are associated with riverside
fishing lodges.
If the fish aren’t biting, head to the Atlantic Salmon Museum in
Doaktown and read about other anglers’ successes.
Going Golfing
Imagine striding the fairways of one of Canada’s finest golf courses, stay-
ing the night just a chip and a putt from the 18th green, and then teeing
off again the next morning — all for less than you pay for a single round
at a top city course elsewhere in North America. Golfing and golf pack-
ages are a relative bargain across the Maritimes, but Rodd Crowbush
Golf & Beach Resort on Prince Edward Island offers the bonus of activi-
ties for everyone in the family — think tennis, horseback riding, hiking,
canoeing, and more.
Having a Whale of a Time
Hundreds of whales spend the warmer months feasting in the nutrient-
rich waters of the Bay of Fundy. Species such as finback, minke, and
humpback are commonly sighted, while a lucky few spot the world’s
rarest whale — the North Atlantic right whale. Tour boats depart from
Digby Neck (Nova Scotia) and St. Andrews (New Brunswick) throughout
the summer, with trips lasting two to three hours. If the whales are play-
ing hide-and-seek, strike up a conversation with your captain. Most are
local fisherman making a little extra money in their downtime, and all
are characters with a whale tale or two to tell.
Hiking the Highlands
Views along the Cabot Trail, which winds through Cape Breton
Highlands National Park, are stupendous, but this “trail” is a paved road
for vehicles (or cyclists who take their lives into their own hands by tra-
versing the narrow road by pedal power). You’ll best appreciate the
park’s scenery if you move away from the road and hike along one of the
walking trails. The Skyline Trail is a classic. Easily traversed in a half-day,
it ends at a magnificent lookout high above the ocean. And if you’re
lucky, you may spy whales frolicking far below.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
290

Making the French Connection
Acadian culture, which has its roots in the region’s early French set-
tlers, can be experienced in many places and in many ways. Visiting a
museum — those in Caraquet and Miscouche are best — provides a
good introduction to the Acadians and their heroic history. But soaking
up the history of Grande Pré National Historic Site, taking in a concert 
at Village Historique Acadien (Caraquet), or feasting on a rappie pie at
Rapure Acadienne (Meteghan) really brings the culture to life.
Sailing into the Sunset
No other boat is better known in Canada than the Bluenose (look on the
back of the Canadian dime for a scaled-down version), and nothing is
more romantic than spending an evening under sail on the Bluenose II,
an exact replica of the original. She has a packed summer schedule of
public cruises throughout the Maritimes, with regular departures from
her home port of Lunenburg as well as from nearby Halifax. Book well
ahead of time to be assured of a spot on board — otherwise you’ll be left
waving from the dock.
Snapping the Perfect Picture
The combination of colorful subject matter and superlative scenery
makes taking good photos in the Maritimes a snap. South of Halifax, pic-
ture-taking opportunities line up along the coast — the world’s most
photographed lighthouse at Peggy’s Cove, the trio of bayside churches
in Mahone Bay, and the colorful clapboard buildings of Lunenburg. On
the rest of your travels, go beyond the obvious. In New Brunswick, have
your family stand at a tilt in front of Moncton’s Magnetic Hill and snoop
around the narrow back streets of Saint John for a historical perspec-
tive. On Prince Edward Island, rise early to catch the first flush of light
along the red dunes of Prince Edward Island National Park and take to
the back roads for rural panoramas.
Walking on the Ocean Floor
Okay, maybe this description is a little overdramatic, but it’s true in a lit-
eral sense. The action happens at Hopewell Rocks, on the New
Brunswick side of the Bay of Fundy. As the massive Fundy tide recedes,
it leaves the “ocean floor” bare around the entire bay. What makes this
place even more notable is the dozen or so rock towers separated from
the mainland by the forces of erosion.
Chapter 22: Ten Maritimes Experiences 291

Chapter 23
Ten Places to Eat 
Great Seafood
In This Chapter
 Checking out the cream of the crop of seafood restaurants
 Discovering what makes each place special
F
ishophobes beware! Seafood dominates the Maritimes dining scene.
Just about every restaurant offers seafood in some form or another,
and many specialize in it. The food in major Maritimes cities is compara-
ble in presentation and creativity to that in other North American cities,
but it’s offered at a fraction of the price. Beside the regular restaurants,
many small-town cafes serve up seafood; you can count on the fish
being battered, but lobster and mussels are usually boiled, and scallops
sautéed. Finally, there are fish markets. Most coastal villages have one,
usually down near the harbor, selling a range of fresh seafood — perfect
for a home-cooked meal in your cabin.
And so, without further ado, here are the top ten places in the Maritimes
to eat seafood.
Blue Mussel Café
Fresh ingredients, locally sourced whenever possible, are prepared at
Prince Edward Island’s renowned Blue Mussel Café with simple style.
The highlight for many diners is what this restaurant doesn’t have — a
deep fryer. One local specialty is the soft-flavored Malpeque Bay oyster.
Order them au naturel for the full effect. The restaurant setting is as
memorable as the food — a cluster of outdoor tables over the water is
protected from the wind by a renovated wharf building that serves as
the kitchen.

Butland’s Seafood
If you’re visiting Fundy National Park in New Brunswick, drive through to
the adjacent village of Alma, where Butland’s holds a prime position
above the small harbor. Inside this lively market is a bathtub-sized con-
tainer overflowing with cooked lobsters. They are pre-weighed, with
prices (around C$12 per pound) marked on the claws. If someone has
beaten you to the single picnic table out back, head into the national
park and enjoy lunch at any one of its numerous picnic spots.
Chowder House
How does a restaurant that hasn’t seen a coat of paint for years and
doesn’t even offer table service make my top ten? Easy — by serving up
huge portions of super-fresh mussels, crab, and lobster at ridiculously
low prices. The location also helps, perched on a grassy bluff overlook-
ing the Atlantic Ocean in the village of Neil’s Harbour, on Cape Breton
Island.
Five Fishermen
In Halifax, if you’re looking to choose from a wide range of seafood in a
stylish setting, make reservations at the Five Fishermen. Ensconced in
an 1816 red-brick building that was originally a school — and, more infa-
mously, a morgue for bodies of first-class passengers from the Titanic
tragedy — tables are spread through numerous nautical-themed rooms. A
massive wine rack holds pride of place in the center of the restaurant, and
a century-old stained-glass window is the feature in the main dining room.
Muddy Rudder
The Muddy Rudder is nothing more than a ramshackle shed where
orders are taken, a gas burner, and a bunch of plastic table settings on a
grassy area beside the Cabot Trail. The seafood — crab, lobster, mus-
sels, clams, and more — is dunked in a pot of boiling water to order. A
truly unique Maritimes dining experience.
Murphy’s
Murphy’s, in Truro, Nova Scotia, gets my nod for “The Best Maritimes
Seafood Restaurant That’s Nowhere Near the Ocean.” Not only is water
out of sight, but the strip mall setting is unremarkable. Inside, the dis-
tinctly nautical setting includes model ships on the walls and fishnets
hanging from the ceiling. Battered fish with a pile of perfectly cooked
chips is the specialty, served up by no-nonsense waitstaff.
Chapter 23: Ten Places to Eat Great Seafood 293

New Glasgow Lobster Suppers
Lobster suppers have been held throughout Prince Edward Island for
over 50 years. They originated as gatherings in community halls and
church basements, often as fundraisers for some local cause or another.
New Glasgow Lobster Suppers is one of the best. It attracts quite a few
locals, as well as visitors staying in nearby Cavendish. But it has plenty
of room for everyone, with 500 seats on two levels. Don’t come here for
the view (although some tables overlook the River Clyde) or the atmos-
phere (which is fun and informal). Choose this lobster supper for the
food: a fixed-price meal of lobster, complete with all-you-can-eat mus-
sels, seafood chowder, potato salad, and coleslaw. Just make sure to
save room for the strawberry shortcake.
O’Neil’s Royal Fundy Market
Digby, on the Nova Scotia side of the Bay of Fundy, is renowned for its
fleet of scallop boats that harvest the sweetest, plumpest scallops you
can ever imagine. At Digby’s dockside fish market, they’re sold raw to
go, or rolled in flour and fried up on the spot. The market also sells
Digby chicks, a chewy, jerky-style snack of smoked herring, as well as
mussels, oysters, lobsters, and a variety of Fundy fishes such as halibut.
Seaweed Pie Café
At Miminegash, in Prince County, Prince Edward Island, a group of local
women have formed a co-operative to harvest and process Irish moss, a
type of seaweed that washes up on local beaches in big storms. Irish
moss has traditionally been used as a thickening ingredient in ice cream
and toothpaste, but the ladies of Miminegash market its nutrient-rich
values for health-related products. Not all of it is shipped to outside mar-
kets. Some ends up in seaweed pie, a surprisingly delicious dish served
up in a small cafe that is part of a larger interpretive center.
Shediac Bay Cruises
Add a little spice to your seafood feast by helping haul in the catch
aboard Shediac Bay Cruises. With Captain Eric LeBlanc at the helm,
these trips leave daily from Shediac, north of Moncton, New Brunswick.
The tour begins with an informative talk about the life cycle of the lob-
ster and harvesting methods. The traps are then lifted onto the boat, the
lobsters are extracted, and then they’re boiled in preparation of an
onboard seafood feast of the freshest proportions.

Ten Famous People You
Probably Didn’t Realize
Were Maritimers
In This Chapter
 Inventing the telephone
 Cooking french fries
 Sailing around the world
W
hile the stunning landscape is the Maritimes’ most obvious asset,
the people (universally known as “Maritimers”) themselves are
notable. Frank, friendly, and always with a story to tell, they contribute
to making the region a great place to visit. The following Maritimers
have gone on to greatness beyond their own borders.
Alexander Graham Bell
Prolific inventor Alexander Graham Bell spent his latter years at
Baddeck, on Cape Breton Island, where his waterfront home is still
owned by the Bell family. At the large museum in town, you can learn
about his most famous invention, the telephone, as well as quirky facts,
such as why he could never call his mom (she was deaf).
Stompin’ Tom Connors
If you’re not from Canada, you’re probably not familiar with the patriotic
tunes written and sung by this legendary musician, who was born in
Saint John, New Brunswick, and raised on Prince Edward Island.
Stompin’ Tom has sold three million albums without ever having a song
on the Canadian country charts and without ever releasing a song out-
side of Canada (who says “Bud the Spud” isn’t radio-friendly?).

Samuel Cunard
Born the son of a Halifax carpenter, Samuel Cunard was the man behind
Cunard Steamship Limited, the most recognizable name in ocean travel.
In 1840, a Cunard ship made the first trans-Atlantic passenger service,
marking the start of the company’s heyday. Today the company has just
one boat in service, the Queen Mary II, the largest passenger ship ever
built.
Sam Langford
Generally regarded as one of the ten greatest heavyweight boxers of all
time, Nova Scotia–born Langford stepped into the ring over 600 times
through the first two decades of the 1900s. During his career, he fought
in five weight divisions — lightweight through to heavyweight — but
makes this list for his final fight, which he fought after having been
declared legally blind. The result? He won. By a knockout.
The McCain Family
Like thousands of others, the McCain family emigrated from Ireland to
the Maritimes in the 1820s, farming hay on a small plot of land alongside
the Saint John River. By the mid-1900s, hay had been replaced by pota-
toes. A half-century later and McCain Foods is the world’s largest sup-
plier of frozen french fries. They have 20,000 employees working in 50
factories to process 346,000 kilograms (760,000 pounds) of potatoes
every hour. Probably the most amazing fact is that McCain world head-
quarters is in the family’s hometown of Florenceville, New Brunswick
(population 800).
Lucy Maud Montgomery
No other person in Canada has as well-preserved a childhood as this
famous writer, who grew up at Cavendish on Prince Edward Island and
used her early memories to create the character Anne of Green Gables, 
a lovable orphan girl. The paths Montgomery walked, the room in which
she was married, and the unremarkable but much-visited farmhouse
known as Green Gables make up Anne-fan favorites.
Anne Murray
With sales of 54 million albums and more awards than any other female
singer, Anne Murray continues to entertain people worldwide with her
sultry voice that blends pop and country. Murray was born in Springhill,
Nova Scotia, and retains strong ties to the region through the town’s
Anne Murray Centre.

John Patch
Patch, a fisherman from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, developed the screw
propeller in 1832. It soon became the preferred method of propulsion in
ships, more effective than either sails or paddlewheels. In 1845, a large
steamship became the first to cross the Atlantic Ocean using his inven-
tion. In the later years of his life, Patch lost the rights to the propeller.
He died penniless.
Harry Saltzman
Harry Saltzman had the movie mogul look: tubby, loud, and always
brightly dressed. He also had the blockbusters to go with the look. Born
in Saint John, New Brunswick, in 1915, Saltzman left home to join the
circus at the age of 17, ending up in Paris during World War II. After pro-
ducing The Iron Petticoat, which starred the unlikely duo of Bob Hope
and Katharine Hepburn, he bought the screen rights to Ian Fleming’s
James Bond novels and then went on to produce the first nine Bond
movies, the biggest espionage thrillers in movie history.
Joshua Slocum
Born in 1844 and raised around Digby, Joshua Slocum left Nova Scotia
for a life on the high seas at a young age. He is remembered today for
one particular feat: being the first person to sail solo around the world.

Instead call % 905-474-8700 for cardholder
services. For lost or stolen traveler’s
checks, call % 800-668-2639.
Area Codes
The telephone area code for Nova Scotia
and Prince Edward Island is 902. The area
code for New Brunswick is 506.
ATMs
The most common place to find bank
machines is at the entrance to major banks.
Check the back of your debit or credit card
to see what network your bank belongs to,
and then contact Plus (% 800-843-7587;
www.visa.com) or Cirrus (% 800-424-
7787; www.mastercard.com) to find the
location nearest to you.
Business Hours
Business hours vary throughout the
Maritimes. The following is only a guideline.
Banks: Monday through Thursday 9:30 a.m.
to 3:30 p.m., Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Retail
stores: Monday through Saturday 9:30 a.m.
to 5 p.m. Mall shops often stay open until 
9 p.m. later in the week and open on
Sunday from around noon until 5 or 6 p.m. 
In tourist areas, hours fluctuate greatly, and
many shops close completely for the winter.
Credit Cards
For lost or stolen credit cards, contact the
following: American Express (% 800-
668-2639), Diners Club (% 800-363-3333),
Discover (% 800-347-2683), MasterCard
(% 800-307-7309), or Visa (% 800-847-
2911).
Currency Exchanges
The best place to exchange money is a
bank. Refer to the “Fast Facts” section at
the end of each city chapter of this book for
bank locations. Airports at Halifax, Moncton,
Fredericton, and Charlottetown have cur-
rency exchange bureaus. Many Canadian
businesses accept U.S. dollars, but at a
lower rate than a bank would offer you. The
Web site www.xe.com/ucc is a good tool
for checking the latest exchange rates.
Customs
Representatives of Canada Border Services
Agency (% 800-461-9999 or 204-983-3500;
www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca) are located at
every major border crossing and at airports
that receive international flights.
Electricity
Canada’s electrical outlets put out 110 volts
AC, the same as in the United States.

Emergencies
For ambulance, police, or fire department
assistance, call % 911.
Hospitals
The location of local hospitals is listed in
the “Fast Facts” sections of each city
chapter.
Internet Access
Public libraries throughout the Maritimes
allow visitors to use their computers for
Internet access at no cost.
Most major hotels have in-room Internet
access or provide access from a “busi-
ness center.” Bed-and-breakfast owners
are often more than happy to let you send
e-mail (especially if you say something
nice about where you’re staying).
Liquor Laws
You must be 19 years old to consume alco-
holic beverages in the Maritimes.
A “licensed” restaurant or cafe is one that
is licensed by the province to serve alco-
hol to those 19 years of age and older.
Mail
At the time of publication, stamps for mail-
ing standard letters or postcards cost C52¢
(within Canada), C93¢ (to the United
States), and C$1.55 (international).
You can receive mail on the road by having
it addressed to your name and “General
Delivery,” care of the post office in the
town of your choice.
Maps
Each of three provincial tourism offices
(see “Where to Get More Information” later
in the Appendix) offers free information
packages, which include a map that is suf-
ficient for general touring.
Map Art (% 905-436-2525; www.mapart.
com) publishes a number of excellent
regional and city street guides for the
Maritimes. Rand McNally produces a soft-
cover Atlantic Canada atlas.
The region’s only specialty map store is
Maps and Ducks, at 1869 Upper Water St.
in Halifax (% 902-422-7106). Independent
bookstores and chains such as Chapters
(located in all major cities) also carry maps.
Police
Dial % 911 for emergencies.
Safety
The Maritimes is no more or less safe than
anywhere else in Canada. You need to take
the usual common-sense precautions for
your own safety and personal belongings,
just like you would when traveling any-
where else.
Refer to Chapter 7 for details about driving
in the Maritimes and Chapter 10 for tips on
keeping healthy when you travel.
Smoking
Anti-smoking laws in all three provinces
limit smoking in public places such as
malls, museums, and sporting arenas. In
New Brunswick, smoking is not allowed in
restaurants and bars. In the other two
provinces, many restaurants have set
aside an enclosed area for smokers, or
have put limits the hours patrons can light
up. Hotels often have floors reserved for
nonsmokers, while smoking at bed-and-
breakfasts is nearly always limited to out-
door areas. Because ordinances vary from
province to province and even town to
town, you should check before lighting up
anywhere.
Appendix: Quick Concierge 299

Taxes
The federal Goods and Services Tax is 5
percent. Each Maritimes province tacks an
additional tax on all purchases except
food. The Provincial Sales Tax on Prince
Edward Island is 10 percent, for a total of
15 percent in taxes. In Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick, a provincial tax of 8 per-
cent is blended with the GST to make a
Harmonized Sales Tax of 13 percent.
Time Zones
All three provinces are located in the
Atlantic standard time zone (AST), one
hour ahead of New York and four hours
ahead of Los Angeles. From the second
Sunday in March through to the first
Sunday in November, daylight saving time
is observed throughout the region, along
with the rest of Canada (except
Saskatchewan).
Tipping
Tipping in the Maritimes is no different to
anywhere else in Canada or in the United
States. Refer to Chapter 5 for details.
Weather Updates
The best online source of weather reports,
complete with long-range forecasts, satel-
lite pictures, and historical tidbits of mete-
orological data, is the Environment Canada
Web site at www.weatheroffice.gc.
ca. If your hotel room has cable television,
it will probably be tuned in to Canada’s
Weather Channel.
