B
ack in the early Sixties, the only way
to record a TV show was to point a
cine-camera at your set. Considering
the expense of a camera and the poor
quality of the TV image, such dedicated
pioneers should be praised rather than
retrospectively accused of piracy, although
the technical limitations of the time meant
most recordings were silent fragments
rather than full episodes. These days, we’re

now lets you subscribe to a mix
of more than 40 live and
on-demand channels, which you
can watch via Amazon Fire TV,
smart TVs, games consoles,
phones, tablets and laptops.
It includes big names such as
Eurosport, Universal and MGM,
and you can also stream programmes

the Sky platform in the UK.
Although there’s no Sky Sports
or BT Sports, there’s a decent choice

to learn the life expectancy of people in different countries,
before looking at population increases, natural growth, and
birth and death rates. You can compare levels of healthcare

there, with Google alone
offering a staggering 800

to experiment with them and
broaden your writing horizons.
This new tool offers 70 Google
fonts, categorising them visually rather than using obscure
names and terminology, which makes them much easier
to choose between. This means you only need to click the
filters that run down the left-hand side of the screen
to browse the lot.
As well as increasing the weight of the fonts, you can
enter your own text to get a better feel of the eventual look
of your words. The developer says he may include other
Google fonts over time if the site proves popular.

Whether you can justify paying £3.99 a

We pick the 10 best things you must do on the web this fortnight

Need to Know
8 14 - 27 June 2017
What happened?
Apple has unveiled a new version of iOS
that will add to the iPad and iPhone
certain tools and functionality more
commonly associated with computers.
iOS 11 was revealed in early June at
the company’s annual Worldwide
Developers Conference, along with new
iPads and the HomePod (pictured,
far right), a voice-activated smart
speaker to rival the Amazon Echo and
Google Home.
One of the best new features – for the
iPad only – lets you drag and drop
images, text, videos and other content
from one app to another in a split-
screen mode. Content can also be
dragged into apps in the Dock along the
bottom of the screen, making it easier
to share an image in iMessage, or open
one to edit in the Photos app.
Also new in iOS for iPads is a Files app
that shows the files and documents
stored on your device and in your cloud
services. If you shell out for an Apple
Pencil, your handwritten notes will be
searchable, thanks to machine-learning
technology that can decipher your
scribbled words.
Alongside those features, iOS 11
includes an update to the camera
software that reduces the amount of
storage your photos consume but does
so without affecting image quality, and
optical image stabilisation in Portrait
Mode to make your snaps sharper.
A beta of iOS 11 is already available,
with the final release expected at the
end of September. As always, the
update is free.
Aside from the iOS update, Apple also
announced new iPad Pro models and a
redesigned App Store, which will be
split into games and apps to make it
easier to find what you’re looking for.
New tools in Apple’s browser Safari
include options to block companies
tracking you online, and to stop web
adverts playing automatically.
The HomePod, which goes on sale in
December, uses Siri to answer your
questions and play music. However, at
$349 (around £270, although UK pricing
wasn’t revealed), it’s much more
expensive than Amazon’s Echo (£150)
and Google’s Home (£129).
How will this affect you?
If you’re an iPad fan but miss some of
the functionality of your laptop, you’ll
love the new features in iOS 11 that make
it more like using a standard computer.
The ability to drag and drop means
you can simply drag an image into
WhatsApp or iMessage to send to a
friend, rather than fiddling with sharing
tools. The Files app means you can find
documents, images and everything else
using a similar system as on a laptop.
As with all its updates, Apple is
offering iOS 11 for free. However, it will
only be available for the iPad 5th
generation and newer, the iPad mini 2
and newer, and all iPad Pro devices.
On the iPhone, you’ll need at least an
iPhone 5s. While that may disappoint
users with older devices, it’s worth
remembering that those smartphones
and tablets date back to 2013, which
means Apple is offering four years of
updates. That’s longer than many
phones and tablets normally last. If you
do have an older device, it will continue
to work – you just won’t be able to get
the iOS 11 update.
What do we think?
We’re delighted that these much-
needed tools are coming to the iPhone
and iPad – it’s about time. Apple’s
hardware is already top of the range,
but there are plenty of improvements
that can be made to the software, and
the move to include the tools and
functionality that make computers so
useful will certainly make phones and
tablets feel less limiting. It marks a
change from Apple’s recent policy,
which has been to grab headlines with
innovations that sound hi-tech, but
don’t prove particularly useful.
As for the HomePod, its price will give
it a narrower appeal than the equivalent
devices from Google and Amazon, but
Apple’s diehard fans will probably think
it’s worth the money.

like a computer
iOS 11 lets you drag and drop content,
as you would on a laptop

Need to Know
What happened?
Android users, watch out
for Judy. The innocuously
named malware has
infected as many as 36
million Android phones,
according to security firm
Check Point. Judy is
adware, which means it
infects your device and
bombards you with
adverts. It’s spread by
seemingly safe downloads
of games based on a
character called ‘Fashion
Judy’ or ‘Chef Judy’, hence
the name of the adware.
The 40-odd Judy apps
have since been removed
from Google’s Play Store,
but Check Point said its
research suggested they’d
been readily available for
several years.
How will it affect you?
If you have any of these
apps on your phone, delete
them now. We’ve been
taught to trust apps on
Google Play, because the
company has anti-malware
tools in place to keep such
threats at bay. However,
these apps have figured
out a sneaky way to dodge
Google’s protections, by
appearing to be benign
games that people actually
want to download. When a
Android devices
punched by Judy
Judy app is installed, it
connects with the
criminal’s server,
downloading the malware.
Sadly, this means there’s
little you can do to avoid
such malicious apps, short
of only installing those you
know come from trusted
brands. Check Point
advises installing mobile
security software, to
provide protection against
malware on your phone –
handily, the company
makes just such a product.
What do we think?
This sort of activity isn’t
particularly damaging to
users, and is more of an
annoyance, but it
highlights the problem with
having millions of apps
available – at the last count
in March, the Google Play
Store had 2.8 million on
offer. Vetting all those
games and apps is nigh on
impossible.
Google is wise to have
automated tools that catch
the most obvious
offenders, but perhaps it’s
time for additional manual
checks or stricter rules,
even if that limits the
number of apps on offer.
We’d rather have fewer
‘Fashion Judy’-style junk
apps and a safer
marketplace.
What happened?
Most of us are unaware
when we’re clicking away
on social media that even a
‘like’ or retweet can count
as publishing.
One man in
Switzerland
found this out
the hard way,
after being
found guilty of
defamation
and fined
4,000 Swiss
francs (£3,190) simply for
clicking ‘like’ on other
people’s Facebook posts.
The case was brought by
Erwin Kessler, the
president of an animal
rights group, who
complained to the courts
that he was being called
racist, anti-Semitic and
fascist in a Facebook
group.
Even though the man in
question didn’t write the
posts – which were
comments written by other
parties who have since
been convicted – he
clicked ‘like’, thereby
helping to spread their
content and ensure more
people saw them, thanks to
how Facebook’s algorithm
presents messages.
How will it affect you?
This case was very
specific and happened
in Switzerland, so don’t
panic and start ‘unliking’
(‘disliking?’) everything
you’ve clicked recently.
However, it’s worth
remembering that what
you do online can have
legal repercussions, and
that the UK courts are
‘Liking’ Facebook
posts could cost you
prepared to act. Columnist
Katie Hopkins had to
pay out £24,000 for
tweets libelling author
and cook Jack Monroe,
while Sally Bercow, the
wife of the House of
Commons speaker, was
slapped with undisclosed
damages after a tweet
defaming Lord McAlpine.
What do we think?
Social-media users aren’t
generally experts in media
law or the technology
behind such sites. This
means that most people
aren’t aware of the finer
points of defamation and
libel, nor do they fully
understand that simply
‘liking’ a post will help raise
its profile.
While intent is a
consideration, and the man
convicted of defamation
was indeed signalling his
agreement of the negative
and inaccurate posts,
ignorance of the law is no
excuse. The best advice is
the same as in the offline
world: just as you’d think
before you speak, think
before you tweet on Twitter
or ‘like’ on Facebook.

FIRST LOOK

Nokia 3310
bit.ly/nokia425
The original Nokia 3310 was
released in the year 2000
and, unfortunately, we think
that’s where it should have
stayed. Although Nokia has
managed to modernise the
phone in a way that makes
it feel exactly as you
remember it (despite it
being much lighter and
thinner), £50 is a relatively
high price to pay for
nostalgia. Indeed, if you
want a feature phone,
basic models from Alcatel,
Doro, Samsung and even
Nokia start at around £10.
The original 3310’s screen
had a resolution of 84 x 84
There is a version of Opera Mini
built in, but you won’t want to use
it much because the cellular data
connection is limited to 2.5G. And no,
you can’t connect to Wi-Fi. In fact, the
only real sign that you’re even in 2017
is the microUSB port on the top edge
of the phone, where the battery is
charged. Battery life is the one area
where the 3310 excels: it offers 22
hours of talk time and a month’s
worth of standby, according to
Nokia’s figures.
It might seem harsh to compare the
Nokia 3310 – a deliberate throwback
to 17 years ago – to the phones of
2017 but there’s good reason to do so
because most people will find this
phone a chore to use. If staggeringly
good battery life is what you want,
there are alternatives available that
are much cheaper than the 3310.
What happened?
Following our lead news story in Issue
422 (bit.ly/webuser422), Google has
confirmed rumours that it will
be building its own ad blocker
into its Chrome browser,
giving web publishers until next
year to clean up their sites
to avoid problems.
Over the past few years,
ad blockers have increased
in popularity, although that’s
levelled out to 22% of web
users this year. As we reported,
Google seemed likely to
introduce a built-in ad filter
similar to that offered by
Opera, and that now looks set
to happen in 2018. Chrome already
blocks pop-ups, which are frequently
used for advertising.
Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior vice
president of ads and commerce at
Google, acknowledged in a blog post
(bit.ly/blocker425) that most online
content is funded by advertising.
“But the reality is, it’s far too common
that people encounter annoying,
intrusive ads on the web – like the kind
that blare music unexpectedly or force
you to wait 10 seconds before you can
see the content on the page,” he said.
To help, Chrome will start blocking
ads that “are not compliant with the
Better Ads Standards starting in early
Chrome to have a built-in ad blocker from 2018
2018,” Ramaswamy said, stressing that
this includes ads that are “owned or
served by Google”. Conveniently, most
of Google’s ads already comply with
that standard (bit.ly/coalition425).
How will it affect you?
If you use Chrome, this news means
you’ll be able to ditch your current ad
blocker, such as Adblock Plus or uBlock
Origin, and free up the memory guzzled
by that extension. Bear in mind, though,
that Google will still allow ads it deems
acceptable and it isn’t yet clear whether
you’ll be able to block those, too.
If you run your own website, you’ll
need to ensure that any ads displayed
on it meet the required standard or else
they’ll be filtered and you’ll be deprived
of revenue.
What do we think?
As we said in Issue 422, this turnaround
in Google’s attitude towards ad blockers
seems to be motivated by its desire
to have total control over online
advertising. It’s interesting to note that
Google is also working on a tool that
lets websites allow their visitors to use
Chrome’s new ad blocker if they pay a
small fee – one that we suspect Google
will take a cut of. However, we’ve always
objected to annoying online ads, so we
cautiously welcome Google’s change of
heart and look forward to seeing the
blocker introduced in 2018.

However, it isn’t a

have to use the 15

You navigate the menus
by pressing the frame of

which makes it a clunky
experience for anyone

there’s no support for

overheating, and the warm weather at this time of year
only makes things worse. WheelAir is a wheelchair
backrest cushion that uses fan technology to gently blow cool air onto the user’s
back, enhancing their comfort, removing excess heat and moisture, and
regulating their body temperature to keep them cool as they go about their day.
The easily attachable cushion also provides support and fits all manual chairs
with a back rest. The WheelAir team hopes to raise £30,000 by 1 July.
Apple could be getting rid of its existing
Touch ID Home button, replacing it with
new optical fingerprint-sensor
technology in the iPhone 8 that spans
the entire display. This is according to a
report from Chinese publication
Economic Daily News, which references
sources from Apple supplier Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company (TSMC).
According to the paper, as relayed by
MacRumours (www.macrumours.com),
news about “an optical fingerprint
sensor to enable authentication directly
on the screen” came during TSMC’s
annual Technology Symposium held in
Taipei. This was not the only thing
reportedly discussed at the conference.
The sources also claimed that
augmented-reality functions would be
enabled in the new phone, thanks to
“invisible infrared image sensors”, which
would also enhance camera
functionality. They also claimed that the
screen ratio would change from the
iPhone 7’s 16:9 to 18.5:9.
Apple is thought to have been
developing on-screen fingerprint
identification for the past couple of
years. Indeed, the iPhone 7 was for a
while expected to introduce the
technology, but in the end it featured a
standard Touch ID home button and a
design very similar to the iPhone 6S.
Is Apple ditching the
Home button on
the iPhone 8?

LIKELIHOOD RATING
✓✓✓✓✓
Considering that Samsung
ditched a front-facing fingerprint
sensor in favour of the Galaxy
S8’s edge-to-edge ‘Infinity’
display, we think it’s highly likely
that Apple will be looking to
maximise display space on its
new flagship phone. Indeed, the
iPhone 8 has a huge fight on its
hands when it arrives, because
the Galaxy S8 features a brand
new AI assistant along with its
buttonless display. However, the
S8 still includes a conventional
fingerprint sensor on its rear, so
on-screen fingerprint
identification represents a
perfect opportunity for Apple to
introduce something
revolutionary.

THIS ISSUE’S EXPERT:
David Emm, principal
security researcher
at Kaspersky Lab
(www.kaspersky.co.uk)
Q
What’s the best
way to avoid
getting infected
by dodgy apps such as
Judy (see page 9)?
Spencer Whitehead,
Twitter
A
It’s more crucial
than ever to
protect ourselves
from malicious apps. Apps
offer us entertainment,
communication and
Kodi flaw lets hackers take
control of your PC
Media players including
Kodi and VLC have a
flaw that could allow
hackers to take control
of your PC, according
to security firm Check Point.
Researchers discovered that a new
form of attack involving malicious
subtitle files could be used to take
control of any type of device.
Streaming tools and media players
treat subtitle databases as trusted
resources, but Check Point
researchers identified that they can
be manipulated to spread malware.
Antivirus software is unlikely to
identify the true nature of these
subtitle files, because they’re
normally perceived as harmless
text files. This effectively leaves
hundreds of millions of users
exposed to attack.
convenience, but they also
put our data and devices at
risk due to their everyday
functionality. Technical
findings and analysis from the
Kaspersky Security Network
(KSN) and an experiment
into app performance by
Kaspersky Lab found that of
every 100 Android apps that
users install, 83 have access
to sensitive user data, such as
contacts and messages, and
some can even make calls
and send text messages. This
is worrying when we consider
that 96 in 100 Android apps
start working without users
launching them.
The build-up of digital
clutter makes it more
important than ever to
combat malware that uses
apps’ vulnerabilities
to penetrate devices.
Here are a few simple steps
for decluttering your apps
and protecting your data:
• Have active and up-to-date
software: use a reliable
mobile-security app and
allow automatic updates to
run for all apps. These are
in place to protect you from
new security threats.
• Use a strong passcode:
at least 12 characters, with
a combination of letters,
numbers and symbols. Use
a password manager for
accounts that do not store
your financial information.
• Back up your data: making
a regular backup of your data
is a must, whether to an
external hard drive or a cloud
service.
• Change app settings:
these let you manage how
the app interacts with your
device. For example, apps
can get access to your
sensitive information, track
your location and share
your data with third-party
servers. Failure to manage
these settings can result
in unused apps gaining
access to information on
your phone without you
being aware.
• ‘Spring clean’ your
device: spend some time
getting your digital house
in order by regularly
clearing out data,
uninstalling unused apps
and refreshing information
stored on your devices.

375,000 PCs vulnerable to
‘ExplodingCan’ exploit
As many as 375,000 computers
worldwide could
be vulnerable to
an exploit that
lets hackers take
remote control of your PC and install
malware, according to researchers at
Manchester security firm Secarma. The
hack, known as ‘ExplodingCan’, affects
PCs running Windows 2003 and targets
a specific vulnerability in Windows
Server 2003. When exploited, the
vulnerability triggers a memory flaw
known as a ‘buffer overflow’, which
enables hackers to take over a PC.
The security firm identified that
telecommunication, banking and
insurance companies, along with
educational and government
institutions, are among those that
could be affected.
Paul Harris, managing director of
Secarma, said: “Ultimately this is in the
same risk category as the WannaCry
attacks. It’s another way for
cybercriminals and hacking teams to
access your environment and, once
they’re in, the internal parts of these
systems are wide open to a variety of
different attack vectors”.
To ensure protection against the
vulnerability, Secarma recommends
that organisations upgrade to a
supported version of Windows server.

promoting the ‘Move to iOS app’ available
from Google Play, it launches into the
merits of the iPhone’s camera, its speedy
chips, simplicity and privacy features,
each accompanied by a fun animation,
then presents the current selection of
iPhones. It’s reasonably persuasive but
the explanations are rather brief and
could do with links to further information.

Q

Mark Briggs, via email
A
The popularity of WordPress makes
it a target for hackers but I wouldn’t
recommend security plugins
because if your site is hacked, their integrity
will be compromised. Instead, just harden
your WordPress installation. Choose a good
hosting company (with SFTP/SSH access,
domain separation, the latest PHP version
and good support), set up a strong password
and username (“admin” is never the right
choice), and use two-factor authentication
– Google Authenticator (bit.ly/ga425) or
Rublon (bit.ly/ru425). Keep your WordPress,
themes and plugins updated, only download
them from trusted sources, back up regularly
and consider version control.

nkjet printers have become increasingly affordable, with PC
retailers and even supermarkets piling them high and selling
them cheap. However, the bargain you take home might not
seem such great value for money when you realise how often
the ink needs to be replenished and how much that costs.
In this Group Test, we’ve reviewed six multifunction inkjet
printers, including two older models that are currently available
at heavily discounted prices. As well as looking at how well the
printers perform, both in speed and print quality, we also
scrutinised how much ink the printers consume and the cost
of replacing their cartridges.
Inkjet printers
We’ve reviewed six multifunction inkjet printers, testing and
comparing them for speed, quality of printing and running costs
HOW WE TESTED
We ran each printer through a barrage of timed printing
tests, including a five-page colour report, a 20-page
monochrome text document and a full-colour photo-
montage. We then compared the output of each printer
to assess quality, checking the clarity and definition of
blacks and colours. We also compared the print capacity
and price of each manufacturer’s cartridges, to work out
and compare the total cost of running each printer.
Group Test
We test and compare the latest products
This Brother inkjet is the
largest printer in this
test, so you need to
make sure you’ve got
enough room to house
its bulky 530 x 398mm
footprint. It’s bursting
with features, though,
and is the only printer in
this round-up to offer A3 printing.
It was the fastest in our tests at producing mono prints,
managing 16.7ppm (pages per minute), and it’s no slouch
at colour printing, either – only the HP Envy 4520 was faster.
Print quality is also respectable: black doesn’t have the
definition you’d expect from a more expensive device but it’s
adequate, while photo prints are excellent, showing vibrant
colour and good contrast between light and dark shades.
Given its great performance, you’d expect the Brother inkjet
to charge a premium for its cartridges, but at 1p per mono
print and 4.2p per colour print, the total cost of printing
5,000 pages came second only to the Epson.
Epson has taken a stand
against the exorbitant
running-costs of inkjet
printers by switching
cartridges for a system of
internal ink tanks, refilled
using cheaper bottles that
hold enough ink to print
6,500 pages. The results
speak for themselves: mono
prints cost just 0.24p per
page; colour prints cost 0.5p.
If value for money is your priority, the Epson is the ideal
option. On the downside, refilling the cartridges can be messy
and the printer has to ‘charge’ the ink after you’ve filled the
tank, which can take 20 minutes. It’s also slow: only the
super-cheap Canon Pixma MG4250 took longer to print than
the Epson’s 9.9ppm mono speed. Quality isn’t perfect, either:
text suffers from ragged edges, while our test photos on plain
paper were dull and lifeless, though they perked up
considerably when printed on glossy paper.

This Brother inkjet is a beast of a printer, but if you’ve got the space for its
sizable bulk, you’ll find it has a lot going for it. It produces great-looking prints,
both double-sided and A3, and excellent photos – and doesn’t take ages doing
it. Best of all, it’s reasonably priced and cheap to run.
This isn’t the fastest or most capable printer, but if you print a lot and are
willing to compromise on speed and quality, the low running costs are very
attractive indeed. It also produces hardly any waste because there are no
cartridges to throw away.

14 - 27 June 2017 21

For a relatively low
price tag, the Envy
7640 has a surprising
number of additional
features. A sheet feeder
on the top of the device
means you can dump
a pile of stuff to copy
or scan without having
to manually carry out each one, and it also comes with fax
capabilities, if you’re still sending and receiving them.
The quality of printing is good enough, particularly on
photos and colour documents, but the black isn’t as sharp
as we’d like. Running the printer is expensive, too, because
you’ll have spent £359.97 by the time you’ve printed your
5,000th sheet.
The HP Envy
4520 has the
same stylish,
compact design
as more
expensive
printers, despite
being a couple
of years old. It has a touchscreen interface that makes it easy
to control and was one of the fastest printers in this group,
managing 16.3ppm in mono and 9.8ppm in colour. Even the
print quality was reasonable, if not brilliant.
However, its running costs make it less appealing. At 5.3p
per sheet when printing in mono, it’s a pricey option that will
have cost you more than £350 by the time you’ve printed
your 5,000th page.
This unassuming box
is well designed and
has a large 12.6cm
screen, which makes
it slick and simple
to operate.
If photo quality
is your priority, this
is definitely the
printer to go for. It wasn’t that brilliant on plain paper
but it comes into its own when printing on glossy paper.
However, it’s expensive to buy and run, and by the time
you’ve printed out your 5,000th page, you’ll have spent
£411.61. Most of this cost is due to its colour printing, which
costs 8.7p per sheet. Mono printing come out at a more
reasonable 1.4p per sheet.
The Canon Pixma
MG4250 is an older
model from 2012, but
it’s still available at
a very cheap price.
It has a built-in flatbed
scanner, 802.11n Wi-Fi
and a colour display,
though this isn’t a
touchscreen and uses
buttons to control it. The printer is the slowest of the models
we tested, printing at 8.8ppm in mono. We also found the
print results disappointing because it laid down too much
ink on colour prints, while mono printing lacked finesse. It was
reasonable at printing photos on glossy paper, though our
prints were a little grainy and the colours were muted.

OUR VERDICT
We awarded our Gold Award to the
Brother MFC-J5330DW because it’s
got what it takes in all the right places.
Crammed with features, from a sheet
feeder to A3 printing, it’s excellent
at printing photos, prints at a very
reasonable speed and offers good
value for money, both in the asking
price and the long-term cost of printing.
Anyone looking for an affordable,
waste-free printer should seriously
consider the Epson EcoTank ET-2600,
which is significantly cheaper to run
than the other printers we reviewed
here. However, it’s not as quick or as
good at printing as the Brother.
Our Bronze Award goes to the HP Envy
7640, because it produced great-looking
prints and has many of the extras you’ll
want from a multifunctional printer and
scanner. However, it’s not ideal if you print
a lot because the running costs are high.

source from the web interface – which is
handy if you don’t want people to know
where your cameras are – and capture
audio from a custom source.
To download the program from the
Contaware.com website, go to the
Download page, click ‘latest’, ‘english’
and then ContaCam-7.0.0-Setup.exe.
If you’re looking for capable video-
surveillance software that does the job
for free, ContaCam is the perfect tool.
It’s been around since 2010 and
supports almost any type of camera
you’re likely to own, including webcams,
WDM and DV devices, and Network
cameras. The best thing about
ContaCam is that it can handle video
from multiple cameras, which means
you can monitor your entire home with
a single program. It’s highly
configurable, too, so you can set it up to
suit your exact needs.
We found its motion detection
reliable, but you can tweak its
performance by adjusting the sensitivity
and the size of the detection area.
You can also schedule times when the
program is active, which means you can
disable detection while you’re at home
and awake, and turn it back on when
you’re out at work or in bed. When the
software detects motion, you can opt to
view the event as animated thumbnails

This free word processor is based on the
WordPad program that’s built into Windows. The
software can open TEXT, RTF, DOC and DOCX
files, and lets you work with images, tables,
hyperlinks and objects. Among its features, it
offers tabs, a clipboard manager, support for
templates, paragraph-formatting options, a
spell-checker, screen-capture tool and auto-save.
Jarte’s interface may take some getting used
to, but it offers all the tools you need. Buttons on
the left and right provide access to different
menus, and four buttons in the middle let you
customise the interface, display document
information (number of pages, lines, words and
characters), manage tabs and zoom in or out.
Turning a document into a PDF file used to
require expensive software, but these days
it’s free and very easy to do. Windows 10
comes with its own built-in Print to PDF
feature, and there are plenty of third-party
tools available for free. If you’re worried
about people copying text from a PDF
you’ve created, this program offers a
simple solution that will foil their efforts.
Simply open your PDF, choose to
protect either individual pages or the
entire document, and click the Start
Now button. This replaces all the text
on the pages with vector graphics that
can’t be copied as easily as text can.
MacOS has a useful feature called Quick Look
that lets you preview a file instantly by
highlighting it and hitting the spacebar.
QuickLook brings this same feature to
Windows. Once it’s installed, you can preview
a file by going into File Exlorer, highlighting
the file and hitting the spacebar. It works with
a wide range of file types, including images,
videos, archives, PDF files, HTML documents,
Office documents (provided you have Office
installed) and text files, among others.
Press the up, down, left and right arrow
keys in QuickLook to preview another file,
and use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out
of the preview.

We really like the Library,

its Radio and Store

Discover new books on
your New Tab page
Want to find something new to read
that isn’t just Amazon recommending
something based on your past
purchases? Then try 100 Million Books
(www.100millionbooks.org), a new
Chrome extension that selects good
reads and displays them on your New
Tab page. For each book, the add-on
provides a description, a short extract
and a link to reader reviews on
Goodreads. There’s also a link to see the
book on Amazon although, annoyingly,
this takes you to Amazon.com rather
than the UK store – however, most of
the choices can also be found in both.
With 100 million titles to stumble
upon (in theory, at least – we didn’t
browse them all), you’ll never be stuck
for reading inspiration again, and you
can even submit your own quotes from
favourite tomes.
It’s a sad fact that many social-media sites
serve as a magnet for idiotic and obnoxious
comments, which can spoil your enjoyment
of otherwise interesting posts and videos.
Rather than avoiding comments sections
altogether, why not turn those unpleasant
‘opinions’ into harmless emoji? That’s the
idea behind Behave (bit.ly/behave425),
which automatically hides “toxic comments”
on YouTube, Twitter and Reddit and
replaces them with cute faces and objects,
including the ever-popular ‘poop’. The
add-on lets you specify the toxicity level
you’re willing to tolerate, from ‘I’m too
young to die’ to ‘Doomed’. You can click comments to reveal them if you dare,
and help Behave choose the right emoji for any future comments it filters by clicking
‘Improve score’ and selecting an icon. It’s a fun way to make the web a nicer place.
Use DuckDuckGo ‘bangs’
in Google and Bing
Aside from keeping your searches
private, one of DuckDuckGo’s best
features is its support for ‘bangs’ –
quick commands that let you search
thousands of sites by typing, for
example, !w for Wikipedia, !twit
for Twitter or !azuk for Amazon
.co.uk, followed by a search term.
A new extension called !Bang
Quick Search (bit.ly/bang425) adds
this functionality to Chrome so you
can use bangs with Google and Bing,
whichever is your default search
engine. Type your bang into the
address bar, followed by your search
term (or the other way around),
press Enter and you’ll be redirected
to the relevant site to view matching
results. Alternatively, type the bang
to open the website’s homepage.
!Bang Quick Search works with
all DuckDuckGo’s bangs – to see the
full list, visit duckduckgo.com/bang.
Save and reopen multiple
tabs in one go
Chrome lets you bookmark all your
open tabs at once, either by pressing
Ctrl+Shift+D or by right-clicking a tab
and choosing ‘Bookmark all tabs’. The
main drawback to this is that you end up
with loads of bookmarks and need to
select each one individually to restore a
previous session. To make things easier,
install the new add-on BetterMarks
(bit.ly/better425), which lets you save
all your open tabs as one group and
reopen them with a single click. Just
click the add-on’s toolbar button, enter
a name for the ‘task’ and click Save.
You can create as many groups as you
want, merge them all into a single
collection and restore the lot by clicking
Open. Your tabs remain stored even
when you restart your browser.

Set website cookies to delete
automatically
Cookies are useful for remembering your
logins and preferences for websites, but
there’s no reason to keep them for sites you
don’t plan to revisit, especially because they
could be used to track you around the web.
Cookie AutoDelete (bit.ly/cookie425) is a
new Firefox WebExtension, which – as you
may have guessed from the name – deletes
all the cookies set by a site as soon as you
close its tab. It works automatically in Active
Mode, or you can clear cookies manually by
clicking its toolbar button and choosing
Cookie Cleanup (to blitz all stored cookies)
or Clear All Cookies For This Domain. Adding a site to your whitelist prevents
its cookies from being deleted, which is worth doing for your favourite online
destinations. Additionally, Cookie AutoDelete’s toolbar icon shows you how many
cookies a site has implanted in your browser, to flag up the worst offenders.
Download any video from
Facebook
If you want to keep for posterity that
amusing cat video or interesting news
report shared by a Facebook friend,
you can do so in a couple of clicks using
Facebook Video Downloader (bit.ly/
facebook425). This new tool adds a
Download button to every video on the
social network, directly below the main
window to the right of the Comment and
Share options. Click this and the clip will
be converted to MP4 format in a new
tab, so you can download it to your hard
drive or Dropbox folder. Unlike similar
downloaders, the add-on also lets you
crop the converted video to focus on
the best bit, so you can remove adverts
and other irritations. See our cover
Fill in form data
automatically
If you ever get tired of
entering the same information
over and over again when you
register with a website or make
an online purchase, you’ll
appreciate a new Opera add-on
called Form Filler (bit.ly/
form425). This collects and saves
the data you type into online
forms so
you can
re-enter it
instantly
with a
single
click. The
extension
detects the
number of
input fields on any page and
captures the data (offline)
accordingly. You can easily turn
off its Auto Collect and Auto Fill
features when required, and
delete any personal info you
don’t want stored.
Add printing options
to Edge
Slowly but surely,
Microsoft’s Edge browser is
gaining some useful add-ons,
the latest of which is its version

This fortnight’s most useful tips and add-ons to help you get the
most from Chrome, Firefox, Opera and more
feature on page 38 for more advice
about capturing video from the web.
Strip the EXIF data from
your photos
All cameras, including the one on your
phone, record EXIF (Exchangeable
Image File) data containing details
such as when and where a picture was
taken, which could compromise your
privacy if you share your snaps online.
Some photo-sharing services,
including Facebook and Instagram,
automatically strip the EXIF data from
images you upload, but Google Photos
and Flickr don’t, which is where
Picture Exif Cleaner (bit.ly/exif425)
comes in. Browse to a JPEG image on
your hard drive that you want to share
and this add-on will find and remove
the EXIF data. You can then right-click
and save the stripped result.

App of the Fortnight
AUDIO & VIDEO
Timbre
timbre-app.com
4.1
This excellent editing app
offers a small but well-
selected set of tools for
chopping your media files
down to size - for example,
to trim your messy mobile
videos for easier sharing,
or extract your favourite
clips from songs and
audiobooks.
Besides trimming your
files, Timbre can also
convert between formats;
remove sections from files,
then seamlessly join the
gap; speed up audio;
extract sound files from videos; add audio to your videos;
and even change their bitrate so they take up less space.
All these features are very easy to use and, broadly, work
well. We get the impression that Timbre was originally
designed for editing audio files, and then added support
for video simply because it could. Audio tools are
presented at the top when you launch the app – full name
‘Timbre: Cut, Join, Convert mp3’ – and Video is stuck lower
down. And indeed, we found the tools worked better with
smaller files, such as songs, and somewhat less well with
large video files. Timbre is not a big app – at 20.9MB, it’s a
sixth the size of Twitter – and it struggles when converting
videos or joining a number of clips together. The limited
memory of our budget Moto phone probably didn’t help.
Timbre’s default save
settings made us a bit nervous.
If you edit a file (trim it,
remove a section, remove its
audio and so on), Timbre
doesn’t offer to save a new
version – instead, it overwrites
the original. You can avoid
this by changing the filename
when saving (as we explain in
our Mini Workshop, right) but
it’s easy to lose the original
files by accident. Ouch.
Still, we love that Timbre
does for free what most apps
charge money
for – and it
doesn’t include a
single advert or
in-app purchase.

Even grandmasters will be baffled
by this chess app. Rather than
commanding a standard set of pieces,
Really Bad Chess lets you play using a
random configuration – say, eight
knights, four bishops and only three
puny pawns. By keeping the same
moves as standard chess but mixing
up the pieces, this version yields
different tactics and outcomes. You
can play against your phone or tablet

Google
Fuchsia
What is it?
Fuchsia is Google’s third stab at an
operating system following the success
of Android and Chrome OS. Although it’s
still in the early stages of development
and Google is keeping tight-lipped over
its intended function, strong evidence
suggests it will run on both mobile and
desktop devices and could even replace
Android and Chrome OS. Only time will
tell if this is true but it’s certainly getting
tongues wagging.
When was it announced?
Google sneaked Fuchsia out last August
when it posted some code on the two
online repositories GitHub (github.com/
fuchsia-mirror) and Google Git (fuchsia
.googlesource.com). The only
accompanying description was:
“Pink + Purple == Fuchsia (a new
Operating System)”, which was
immediately seized upon by tech blogs,
some of which went as far as claiming
that it could be the future of computing.
What do we know about
Fuchsia?
We know it’s open-source and is being
distributed for free. It’s also a ‘real-time
operating system’, which means it
processes data as it comes in, thereby
slashing processing time requirements.
Interestingly, Fuchsia is not being built
on Linux as Android or Chrome OS are.
Instead, the new operating system uses
a microkernel called Magenta,
which has been developed by
Google itself. A kernel is the core
component of an OS, controlling
how software is processed by
a device’s hardware, which
suggests that the web giant
intends to use its own building
blocks this time around.
What’s so special about
this kernel?
It is based on a project called
Little Kernel, which was
designed for software that
powers computers with
a specific function, such as
items that comprise the so-
called Internet of Things (thermostats,
lights, routers and the like). This gives
some idea of the direction in which
Google may be heading. What makes
matters more intriguing is that Google
has confirmed that Magenta is designed
for phones and fast-processor PCs. This
had led to speculation that Fuchsia will
be an all-encompassing OS that can be
the engine for just about anything.
But why is Google ditching
Linux?
It is not
ditching Linux
in general, just
for Fuchsia.
Perhaps one
reason is that
Android is
using outdated
versions of the
Linux kernel –
the recent
Google Pixel
smartphone,
for instance,
uses version
3.18 even
though this
was released
almost three
years ago –
that’s an eon in technological terms.
It’s understandable that Google wants
to keep its products as up-to-date as
possible and the only way to truly control
that is to start from scratch with your
own building blocks.
Could these pink and purple
fuschia have inspired the new OS?

Google Fuchsia
So Fuchsia could be in
competition with Android?
Google experimenting with a completely
new OS suggests this is at least possible,
although it could just be a replacement
for Android. As we’ve said, Fuschia could
become an all-rounder phone, tablet,
computer and Internet of Things OS.
What does it look like?
When Fuchsia first emerged, it had
a command-line interface, which meant it
could only respond to typed commands
such as cd, cp and echo. Development
has moved
quickly and
Fuchsia now has
a user interface
called Armadillo.
It’s being dubbed
“the default
system UI for
Fuchsia” and
there’s already
enough to give
you a good feel
for the system.
It has a vertical
scrolling list of
apps, as well as a
card-style design
similar to Google
Now. A profile
card has your details and opens to reveal
lots of settings such as battery life, Wi-Fi
information, brightness, aeroplane mode
and orientation lock. While it’s by no
means the final product, it’s already clear
that it doesn’t look much like Android.
How much of an improvement
is it?
There are some nice early touches, such
as the ability to run split-screen apps.
By pressing
down on an
app window,
you can drag
it over
another and
then decide
which one
appears at
the top or
bottom of
the screen.
You can have
as many as
four apps
on the
screen at
once, which
will facilitate
multi-tasking
and improve
productivity. Throw in a suggestions
feature seemingly inspired by Google
Now, and the beginnings of a new
keyboard, and you have the makings
of something rather exciting.
Will it use apps?
It certainly will.
Apps will be
created via
Google’s Flutter
Software
Development
Kit (SDK), which
is already being
used to make
cross-platform apps
for Android and iOS.
Flutter itself is an
alpha, open-source
project that was used to create Armadillo
itself, so the framework is already there
for seamless app creation. When Fuchsia
is officially released, app developers will
surely clamour for a piece of the action.
When will Fuchsia be released?
That’s the big question. The truth is that
no one other than the brains working
for Google can tell you the answer and,
as we’ve said, they’re maintaining an air
of mystery over the project. It may
emerge that Fuchsia is simply a testing
ground for a user interface that will never
see the light of day on mass-market
phones, relegated instead to a side
project that runs alongside Android and
ChromeOS. But Fuchsia developer Travis
Geiselbrecht told the public Fuchsia IRC
channel that the operating system “isn’t
a toy thing” and he stressed that it will be
worked on for some time to come. One
thing’s for sure – you won’t see the fruits
of Google’s labour appear on devices
being sold this year.
Can I not test a preview on my
current phone?
If you download and compile the Fuchsia
System UI into an Android APK, you can
install it on an Android device. It’s not
worth doing this on your current handset
because, at this
point, there’s
not much you
can do with it.
A better idea
is to check out
the Flutter
Gallery app,
which you can
download from
Google Play
(bit.ly/
flutter425). This
shows widgets
and behaviours
built with
Flutter that at
least give an
indication of
how Fuchsia
apps will look.
Firefox OS
Commercially released in 2013, Mozilla’s mobile operating system
was officially discontinued in September last year. Built using
HTML5 and the Linux kernel, it looked similar to Android and its
free, open-source platform used web apps. Attempts to direct the
OS towards connected devices such as TVs ultimately failed to gain
traction.
Tizen
This open-source OS is designed to work on smartphones, tablets,
netbooks, smart televisions and in-car infotainment systems.
Backed by Intel and worked on as an open-source project within
the Linux Foundation, it merged development with Samsung’s
Bada OS. It is used in Galaxy Gear smartwatches and the Samsung
Z2 smartphone.
Ubuntu Touch
Created for touchscreen tablets and phones in 2011, Ubuntu Touch
was axed in April this year before being picked up by a team of
developers called Ubports. It is a mobile version of the Ubuntu OS
and it is navigated by swiping from the sides of the screen to
access different parts of the system. There are apps for Facebook
and YouTube.
Android, iOS and, to a lesser extent, Windows Phone, dominate the
mobile market, but that hasn’t stopped these others from having a go

speed and volume; add captions; and
drop in transitions between clips, such
as fade-in, fly-in and wipe. You can also

How it can be improved:
Although ActivePresenter works very

better designed. The ribbon at the top
gives you access to the many tools but
it’s not always obvious where to find
each one, which makes the learning
curve quite steep. Also, the editing
features above the timeline are tiny,
which makes cutting, trimming and

Winner of our Gold Award in Issue
419 (bit.ly/webuser419), oCam can
capture everything that happens on
your PC’s screen, including any
video you
stream from
the web. It’s
packed with
features and
offers
unlimited
recording
time, with no
annoying
interferences such as watermarks.
It’s completely free for personal
use, although slightly hampered by
an unattractive interface and poor
documentation.
Debut
bit.ly/debut425
This versatile video-capture tool
records streaming content in a
choice of formats, including AVI,
FLV, MOV, MP4 and WMV. You can
also select the
device you
want to watch
the video on,
for example
iPhone, Xbox
360 or
PlayStation 3.
It’s very
intuitive with loads of advanced
features, but it’s a paid-for product
and after the 14-day trial expires,
it will cost you £23.43 to buy.
Ezvid
www.ezvid.com
Ezvid lets you record on-screen
activity, including web videos, with
or without narration. You can
capture the full screen or just a
portion of it, but you’re limited to
recordings of
up to 45
minutes.
Finished
screencasts
can be edited
and uploaded
directly to
YouTube and
like other, similar tools, it lets you
draw on your videos. Ezvid is
entirely free, but you’re encouraged
to make a donation to the
developers if you like it.
BEST OF THE REST
40 14 - 27 June 2017
What we liked:
This software lives up to
its name by letting you
record any playing
video – including web
streams. It’s very easy to
use and offers all the basic
features you’re likely to need.
You can set the temporary and output
directories, as well as the output file
name, and adjust the target frame rate
and video bitrate. Simply click Record
Now and adjust the red border to cover
the area you want to capture, then click
the Rec button to start and stop
recording. You can control the capture
with a hotkey (Ctrl+F7), set recording to
stop after a set time (three minutes by
default) or have it end automatically
once the video finishes playing. During
recording, you’re shown how much
hard-drive space the video takes up.
Recordings are saved in the popular
MP4 format, which can be played in any
media player.
How it can be improved:
On our test PC, with a high-resolution
What we liked:
This video-capture
software is easy to
use and comes with
plenty of advanced
features. The interface
has two tabs along
the top: Settings and
‘Video and Audio
Sources’. The former
lets you choose a video format and
frame rate (you can stick with the
recommended default), and change the
recording and playback hotkeys. On the
‘Video and Audio Sources’ tab, you can
tweak audio settings and choose what
to record – so, for example, if you have
more that one monitor, you can specify
the one you want to record from.
VSDC lets you set the exact area you
want to capture, and you can draw on
the recording using a pencil, lines and
shapes. Tapping the small arrow on the
left opens a handy preview panel that
shows you exactly what’s being
recorded.
If you’re not happy with the recorded
quality of your TV show or film, you can
try different ‘render’ settings.

How it can be improved:
A modern, more appealing
interface wouldn’t go amiss and
it could be made more intuitive for
beginners. We’d like to see some
post-recording editing tools, too.
Sound is recorded from external sources
(speakers to mic or line-in) rather than
using the system sound.
OUR VERDICT
VSDC is a very good video-capture
tool, but you need to play around
with the software to get the most
from its features and find the
settings that work best for your
setup.
OUR VERDICT
Display problems aside, this is a
very good screen/video-recording
tool that requires zero technical
knowledge. Just click a few buttons
and enjoy the recording afterwards.

Record online games
If you want to share your gaming
prowess with the world, give OBS
Studio (obsproject.com) a try. This free,
open-source software is available for
Windows, Mac and Linux and lets you
capture the action directly from your
graphics card, then edit and share the
results. You can change the recording
quality (Indistinguishable Quality is the
recommended default) and use hotkeys
to start and stop the capture.
Turn your PC into a digital video
recorder
NextPVR (www.nextpvr.com) is a
brilliant, full-featured video recorder for
your computer that’s entirely free for
personal, non-commercial use. You can
use it to watch and record live TV, set
series links and use it in conjunction
with Kodi – provided, of course, that you
only do so with legal streams. NextPVR
can also stream music, play local videos
and display photos, and has apps for
iPhone and iPad. The catch is that to
watch and record TV shows, NextPVR
requires you to have a tuner card or
similar video-capture tool installed. A
good-quality tuner, such as those
manufactured by Hauppauge (www
.hauppauge.co.uk), will set you back
between £50 and £100.
On Your Computer
Record video streams
in Windows 10
Capturing web streams in Windows 10 is
remarkably easy because the operating
system has a built-in screen recorder
called Game Bar. This is designed to let
gamers take screenshots and record
gameplay footage, so they can boast
about their high scores, but it can be
used to record anything on screen,
including videos. To use Game Bar,
press the Windows key+G. A box will
appear asking if you’d like to open
Game Bar. Select ‘Yes, this is a game’
(even if it’s not - Microsoft won’t know!).
Click the Record button to start and
stop recording, and the Settings button
to configure the settings.
Record web content in Chrome
Although you can’t install traditional
video-capture software in Chrome OS,
you can use Screencastify (www
.screencastify.com) to record any
content that’s playing in a tab, on your
Desktop or via your webcam on your
Chromebook and in the Chrome
browser. The recordings can be saved
locally or in Google Drive, and uploaded
to YouTube to share with the world.
Screencastify supports offline recording
and offers a selection of drawing tools
for annotating your videos.
The free (Lite) version has some
restrictions – your videos have to be
under 10 minutes long (with an
embedded Screencastify logo) and you
are limited to 50 recordings a month
– but that should be enough for most
quick-capture needs (and you can
always save a longer stream as separate
files). If not, the Premium version of
Screencastify costs $24 (£18.75) a year.
If you don’t need a full-featured video-capture program, there are plenty of free
tools that perform specific recording tasks. Here we round up our favourites
Other Ways To Record Streams
Record directly from your
webcam
If you want to capture yourself on your
webcam – perhaps for a presentation or
a birthday message – you can use the
incredibly versatile VLC Media Player
(www.videolan.org) to record the
footage from your webcam. To do this,
open the software, go to Media, Open
Capture Device and set ‘Capture mode’
to DirectShow, if it isn’t already. Use the
drop-down box to change ‘Video device
name’ to your webcam, and ‘Audio
device name’ to your microphone.
Click ‘Advanced options’ and change
the video-input frame rate to 30 or tick
the box next to ‘Device properties.’
You can then watch a live feed,
right-click it and either hit the Record
button to start capturing or click the
arrow next to Play and choose Convert.
When you’re done, hit Stop and the
recording will be saved.
Record web-radio streams
The excellent free tool StreamWriter
(streamwriter.org) lets you record
broadcasts from internet radio stations
to keep for as long as you want. It can
capture multiple streams at the same
time, and automatically records songs
from your wishlist when it detects them
playing in a stream. Ads can be skipped
– something of a godsend when you’re
listening to local radio – and recordings
scheduled, so you don’t miss your
favourite shows when they’re broadcast.

42 14 - 27 June 2017
You should make sure that you
stick to recording and streaming
content that’s available legally,
rather than through some of the
more dubious Kodi add-ons. We’ve
chosen the add-on iPlayer WWW to
illustrate our instructions, which
streams live and catch-up content
from the BBC. This appears in
Kodi’s official Add-ons section and
is legal to use provided you have a
valid TV licence.
Record short YouTube videos
Although the programs we
recommended at the beginning of
this feature let you record YouTube
videos as they play, a more
lightweight alternative is Icecream
Screen Recorder (bit.ly/
icecream425). This offers a clever
trick for capturing videos from
YouTube: open the clip you want to
capture, then click the ‘Capture
video’ button in the top-left corner
and choose ‘Area auto detection’.
This automatically snaps the
recording to the borders of a
YouTube video, so you don’t
capture extraneous parts of the
page. When the area is selected,
click the orange logo of the
program or press the F1 button to
confirm the selection, then click the
Rec button to begin recording.
The catch is that the free version
of Icecream Screen Recorder limits
you to a recording time of five
minutes. If you want to record
longer clips, you’ll have to pay
£20 to upgrade to the unlimited
Pro version.
Record music from Spotify
On mobile devices, Spotify
has an offline mode that
lets you continue listening
to music when you lose
your connection. To achieve similar
flexibility on your Desktop, you can
record streaming audio from the
Spotify Web Player using Spotify
Recorder (bit.ly/spotify425). This
captures songs in MP3 format and
saves them to your hard drive so
you can listen to them whenever
you want.
MINI WORKSHOP
Record Kodi streams using
VLC
1
Once you have both Kodi and VLC Media
Player installed, with the copied script in
the Kodi folder (as detailed in our tip on the
right), open Kodi, and launch any previously
installed streaming add-on – we’re using
iPlayer WWW (bit.ly/iplayer425). Find and
right-click a stream to watch or record, then
choose ‘Play using…’ 1 and select VLC.
2
Your iPlayer stream should open in the
external media player. It may be
minimised to the system tray, in which case
open it from there. Go to Tools, Preferences
and click Input/Codecs. 1 Click the Browse
button 2 next to ‘Record directory or file
name’ and navigate to the folder you want to
store your iPlayer recordings in. Click Save. 3
3
Go back to the iPlayer stream and when
you’re ready to begin recording, right-click
the screen and select Record in the menu. 1
There’s no obvious way to tell it’s recording
so don’t worry if it looks like nothing’s
happening. To stop recording, right-click and
select Stop. Your recording should appear in
the folder you specified in Preferences.
Record your Skype video calls
Skype doesn’t provide tools for
non-business users to natively
record video chats, but that doesn’t
mean it can’t be done. Skype’s
support page (bit.ly/skype425)
offers a list of links to Windows, Mac
and Linux software that you can use
for the task. One of the easiest ways
is to use ShowMore (showmore
.com) – a free, online screen-
capture tool that lets you manually
record anything on your computer
screen, including Skype chats. Just
visit the ShowMore website, click
the Start Recording button and
install the launcher. The tool can
save recorded video in a range of
formats, including MP4, WMV, AVI,
MOV and MPEG. Just remember to
ask the other person’s permission
before you record the call!
Record legal streams
from Kodi
There are several ways to
record streaming content
in Kodi, but one of the
easiest is to switch the
output from Kodi’s own
internal player to VLC.
When you find something
you want to record on Kodi, you
simply select VLC as the player and
use the built-in tools to record the
video in that media player instead.
The first step is to download the
playercorefactory.xml script from
bit.ly/kodisc425 and copy this to
the Kodi folder at
%APPDATA%\kodi\userdata
You may need to change the path
inside the script. Open the
playercorefactory.xml file in
Windows Notepad and look to see
where VLC.exe is listed (it’s likely to
be C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\
VLC), then check where the
program is installed on your PC.
If it’s in:
C:\Program Files (x86)\
VideoLAN\VLC
change the path in the script to
that destination and save the file.
You can now follow the steps in our
Mini Workshop on the left to record
the desired streams.

You can legally record audio and video
streams from the web, although the site
that’s doing the streaming may prohibit
this in its terms and conditions, so check
this to be on the safe side. The
important thing to remember is that the
law only covers you if you’re recording
streaming content for your own personal
use, to watch or listen to later. You’re
expressly forbidden (unless a streaming
site states otherwise) to share recordings with friends or upload them for
others to watch, because this breaches copyright.
That said, you probably won’t get into legal trouble if you privately share
recordings with people you know, so long as they don’t do anything
questionable with them, such as try to profit from them or redistribute them
without official permission. You can’t keep your recordings forever, either –
fair use says you should delete them once played – but there’s no official legal
time restriction in place, so you don’t need to worry too much about this.
Finally, if you’re recording live British TV programmes or radio shows –
regardless of which channel or station they are broadcast on – you must have
a valid TV licence, following the change in the law last year.

PlayOn Cloud for Android (bit.ly/
playon425) lets Netflix subscribers

Expert tips for
Instagram
Instagram isn’t just for teenagers and
celebrities – it has lots of great uses for
grown-ups, too. Edward Munn reveals
the best ways to manage, edit and
share images on the social network
CUSTOMISE YOUR INSTAGRAM SETTINGS
Make your Instagram
profile private
Instagram (www.instagram
.com) lets you share your life
with the world, but if you’d
prefer to hide your account
from public view, just tap
your profile image in the
bottom-right corner of the
app, then tap the three-dot
button and swipe up until you
see ‘Account settings’. Check
that the Private Account
option is enabled so only
people you approve will see
your photos and videos.
When someone asks to
follow you, you’ll receive a
notification and you can then
approve or decline their
request. If you ignore the
requests, they’ll simply pile
up behind the scenes. To find
them, tap the Activity button
(a heart), then select You.
The number of pending
requests is indicated at the
top of the page. Tap the
Follow Requests link and
choose whether to Confirm
or Delete each one.
Get notified when your
favourite accounts post
If you don’t want to keep
checking Instagram, you can
still make sure you never
miss any posts from your
favourite accounts. Navigate
to the profile you want to
receive notifications for,
make sure you’re following it,
then tap the three-dot
button and select Turn On
Post Notifications. You can
also opt to receive
notifications about future
posts from an account, when
you see one of its posts in
your feed. Tap the post’s
three-dot button and select
Turn On Post Notifications.
Stop people tagging
you in photos
Tapping the tag button (the
one that looks like a person
in a folder) on your profile
lets you (and your followers)
see photos you’ve been
tagged in. To protect your
privacy, you can hide photos
from this section by tapping
the three-dot button and
choosing Hide Photos. Select
the photos that you want
to hide, then tap the Hide
button (an eye with a line
through it).
Bear in mind that doing
this doesn’t remove the tags
from the photos altogether.
To do this, open an image,
tap it and select your
username. Now, along with
the option to disable ‘Keep in
Photos of You’, there’s the
option to Remove Tag.
To ensure that photos
you’re tagged in don’t appear
on your profile without your
permission, tap the three-dot
button from ‘Photos of You’
and choose Tagging Options.
Select Add Manually and
you’ll now receive a
notification when someone
tags you in a photo, so you
can choose whether to add it
to your profile. Note that this
just means the image won’t
be found from your profile –
the tag will still show on the
photo unless you follow the
instructions to Remove Tag,
as described above.

Discuss Instagram tips at forum.webuser.co.uk
MANAGE YOUR INSTAGRAM PHOTOS
Save photos captured
with Instagram
You can use any camera app
to take photos to post on
Instagram, but there’s a
built-in snapper to make
things even more convenient.
To open this camera, tap the
‘+’ button and choose Photo
instead of Gallery. There are
buttons to turn on flash and
choose between the front
and back cameras, along
with the shutter release.
Its features are very basic
and you can only shoot in
square format, but it can be
set to save a copy of the
original image before you
make any changes to it (such
as adding filters and effects).
This image is also uncropped
(rather than square format),
making it more versatile for
use elsewhere.
To set Instagram to save
original photos, just tap the
three-dot button in your
profile to open Options, then
swipe up to Settings and
switch on Save Original
Photos. There’s a separate
option for saving your Story
content, which you can read
more about in our last tip on
page 46: ‘Stop people seeing
your stories’.
Organise favourite
photos into collections
Last year, Instagram
introduced the option to
save your favourite photos
and, more recently, it also
added the option to organise
them into ‘Collections’, much
like Pinterest. To save a post,
simply tap the bookmark
icon below it. Tapping and
holding this button lets you
add it to a collection (you’ll
be invited to create one if
you don’t have any). To find
your collections, tap the
same bookmark button from
your profile. The tabs let you
choose between the All or
Collections views. When you
save a post in this way, its
owner will not be notified
that you have done so, unlike
when you ‘like’ a photo.
Hide photos from your
timeline
Archiving is another handy
new feature that lets you
remove images from your
Instagram timeline without
deleting them permanently,
so you can change your mind
if you want to post them
again at a later date.
To archive an image, simply
tap its three-dot button and
select Archive. You can
review your archived photos
by tapping the archive
button (which looks like the
reflection of a Refresh
button) on your profile.
To restore a photo to its
original position on your
timeline, open it from your
archive, tap the three-dot
button and choose ‘Show
on profile’
SEARCH FOR IMAGES ON INSTAGRAM
Search for photos by
keyword or location
Instagram is a fantastic
resource and has photos
of almost anything you can
think of. Indeed, if you want
to find images of a particular
thing or place, it’s an
excellent alternative to
Google Images. Perhaps the
easiest way to find images is
to use the hashtag search
function. Tap the search
button (magnifying glass),
then tap the search bar.
Select Tags and enter a
hashtag that describes the
type of image you want to
find, for example ‘#daffodils’
or ‘#fordmustang’. You’ll
then see the number of posts
that use that hashtag along
with a list of other popular,
associated tags. Tapping a
tag displays its Top Posts
and Most Recent posts.
Instead of using the search
function, you can find an
image on your timeline, tap
any of its tags and use this
to browse for similar content.
Another way to search is
by using locations. To do this,
tap Places instead of Tags
and either enter a location
name (businesses, towns and
postcodes are all accepted)
or select Nearby Places to
see a list of suggested places
in the local area.
As with the tags options,
when you select a location,
you’ll see both the Top Posts
and Most Recent posts, and
whether any Stories have
been captured there
(indicated by a round button
next to the place name.
It’s worth pointing out that
not everyone uses
geotagging on their posts,
so if you want to see photos
of a place, it’s worth
searching for the tag –
for example, ‘#cambridge’ –
and also by using the
location function.
See content ‘liked’ by
your friends
On its Search page,
Instagram suggests posts
and stories you may like
based on what you’ve
already liked and interacted
with. However, another way
to discover new content is by
looking at what your friends
have liked and commented
on. To do this, open the
Activity page and select the
Following tab. Here, you’ll
see a summary of all activity
by the accounts you follow.
It’s important to remember
that all your followers will
be able to track your own
activity in this way, so be
careful not to ‘like’ or
comment on anything that
you’d prefer others not
to see.

46 14 - 27 June 2017
Use Instagram’s editing
tools without sharing
To use Instagram as a photo
editor without making your
images publicly visible on
your timeline, set your device
to Airplane or Flight mode.
Make your adjustments to
the image, then tap Next and
Share. The image or video
will be processed and saved
to your gallery, but because
there’s no network
connection, you’ll see the
message ‘Photo Wasn’t
Posted’. Tap the three-dot
button next to this and select
Discard Post to delete it, then
disable Airplane Mode.
On Android devices, you’ll
find the edited version of the
image in the Instagram folder.
Unlock more photo
filters
When Instagram introduced
a range of new filters a while
back, some of the older ones
were hidden. To restore a
hidden filter, swipe all the
way to the left through the
available filters and tap the
Manage button. You can now
enable and disable filters,
and change their order so
the ones you use most often
are easier to find. If there’s an
effect you don’t like, just
remove it altogether.
Enhance badly lit snaps
If you’ve taken a landscape
photo without enabling the
HDR function on your phone
(it may not even have this
option), you can enhance it
using Instagram’s excellent
editing tools. The Highlights
and Shadows functions let
you replicate the effect of
HDR by making dark areas
brighter and dull areas
lighter. To make your
photograph even more vivid,
try using Structure. This
handy tool brings out even
the subtlest of details in your
image, which can transform
the way it looks.

Discuss touchpad gestures at forum.webuser.co.uk
Double-tap to drag
Tapping the touchpad once selects an
object, while double-tapping it lets you
drag and drop it. On the second tap, just
leave your finger on the touchpad and
move it to drag files, folders and web
elements. In Chrome, for example, you
can drag and drop a link to the New Tab
button to open the URL in a new tab.
Hide all apps/show Desktop
You can hide all apps and reveal the
Desktop by clicking the button at the
right end of the Windows taskbar, but
it’s much quicker to simply swipe three
fingers downwards. Immediately
swiping these three fingers up again will
bring hidden windows back into view.
Swiping three fingers up at any other
time, including after clicking anything
on the Desktop, opens Task View, which
displays all your virtual Desktops and
open apps (you can also click the button
next to Cortana to open Task View).
You can then select one of these apps
with the cursor to open it. Alternatively,
swipe left and right with three fingers
(as described in ‘Switch applications
quickly’) to open a recently used app.
Switch between Desktops
Swiping up and down with four fingers
works in exactly the same way as the
three-finger swipes detailed above.
However, swiping left and right with
four fingers can be used to switch
between virtual Desktops.
Tap with more fingers
Tapping the touchpad performs
different functions in Windows 10
Windows 10 offers many advanced gestures that
you can perform using your laptop’s touchpad.
Edward Munn rounds up the most useful controls
depending on how many fingers you
use. A two-finger tap, for example,
simulates a right click; a three-finger
tap opens Cortana; and a four-finger
tap opens Action Center.
On some PCs, you can customise the
functions for three- and four-finger taps.
Open Settings and Devices, then select
Touchpad and ‘Advanced gesture
configuration’. You can assign three-
and four-finger taps to perform a range
of actions including pausing the current
track in a music player and stepping
backwards and forwards in your
browser. Note that you can also change
the actions for three- and four-finger
swipes from this menu.
Some of the gestures we’ve recommended are only compatible with laptops
equipped with precision touchpads, so don’t worry if you can’t get them to
work. Our Dell laptop is equipped with a precision touchpad but its driver
would override the standard Windows settings, which meant some of the
gestures we tried failed. To access the touchpad driver’s settings, try clicking
‘Additional settings’ in the ‘Touchpad settings’ menu, as described in our first
tip. Alternatively, you should be able to find the manufacturer’s touchpad
settings from the System Tray.
A NOTE ON TOUCHPAD COMPATIBILITY

Swipe to scroll
Swiping two fingers up or down your touchpad lets
you scroll down and up the page you’re viewing.
You can also swipe left and right with two fingers if
the program allows for it. To change the direction
in which a two-finger swipe scrolls, open Settings,
Devices and Touchpad. If you don’t see the option
to change scroll direction on this page, try clicking
‘Additional settings’, then open the touchpad
driver’s menu to change it.
Switch applications
quickly
Instead of pressing Alt+Tab to
switch between recently used apps,
you can do so by simply swiping
three fingers left or right. Swiping
left automatically selects the last
app you opened and opens it
when you lift your fingers off the
touchpad. Swiping right works in
almost exactly the same way,
but makes it easier to open other
recently used apps (rather than
the last-used one).
Zoom in and out
Pinching your fingers or moving
them apart lets you zoom in and
out, respectively. This feature isn’t
exclusive to Windows 10 or
precision touchpads, but it’s
particularly useful when making
small text on web pages more
readable.

Turn on two-step verification
Sometimes you have to put up with
small inconveniences to enjoy peace of
mind, and that’s certainly the case with
two-step verification – also known as
two-factor authentication. This adds
a second layer of protection to your
online accounts, and is much more
secure than relying solely on a
username and password – as we’ve seen
from the massive ‘data dumps’ following
hacks of major sites. This second
security layer involves linking your
phone or another email address to your
account. When you try to sign into the
account from a new device – or after
being logged out on your current one –
you’ll be sent a security code that you
need to enter alongside your password
to regain access.
To set up two-step verification in
Google, go to bit.ly/2step425, click Get
Started, then sign into your Google
account and click ‘Start setup.’ Enter
your mobile number and whether you’d
like the verification code to be sent by
text or voice call, then choose Send
Code. When you receive the six-digit
code, enter it in the box and click Verify
to add your phone number to your
account. Alternatively, you can use
Google’s Prompt feature, which saves
you having to receive and type a code
every time. Instead you just tap Yes to
confirm that
you’re trying to
sign in from
another device.
Because this
method isn’t as
secure, Google
recommends
it’s only used
on phones and
tablets with the
screen lock
activated.
Google also has options for when
two-step verification via your phone
isn’t possible, including one-off backup
codes that you can download and print
to use at your convenience, and an
Authenticator app (bit.ly/
authenticator425) that lets you access
codes offline on
Android and
iOS devices.
To turn off
two-step
verification,
click your
account picture
in the top-right
corner of a
Google page
and choose My
Account. In the
‘Sign-in and
security’ section, click ‘Signing into
Google’, then 2-Step Verification and
select ‘Turn off 2-Step verification’.
To set up two-step verification for your
Microsoft account, go to the ‘Security
settings’ page (bit.ly/security425) and
sign into your account. Under ‘Two-step
verification’, choose ‘Set up two-step
verification’ to turn on the feature, then
follow the instructions. You can receive
your verification codes via text
message, phone call or to an alternative
email address, or generate them using
Standard passwords aren’t enough to protect against today’s data
breaches. Robert Irvine reveals how to lock down your security
an authenticator app, such as Microsoft
Authenticator for Android, iOS and
Windows Phone.
If you grow tired of entering two
forms of authentication, you can add
your device to the list of trusted devices
by ticking the option ‘I sign in frequently
on this device.
Don’t ask me
for a code’.
Or just turn
off two-step
verification
altogether
by selecting
that option
on the
‘Security
settings’ page.
Facebook also offers two-factor
verification, to prevent unauthorised
people from nosing through your
Timeline and trolling your friends. To
turn it on, click the down arrow in the
top-right corner and choose Settings,
Security. Click Edit next to ‘Two-factor
authentication’, choose ‘Set up’ and
click Enable. As with Google, you have a
choice of account-verification methods:
a code sent by text message, a code
generator within the Facebook mobile
app and the option to print recovery
codes to carry with you. You can also
use a USB stick or the NFC function on
your phone as a security key to log into
your account. Additionally, Facebook
offers ‘login alerts’ that notify you when
anyone tries to sign into your account
from an unrecognised device or browser.

Discuss protecting your accounts at forum.webuser.co.uk
You can’t completely avoid using
passwords on the web, but thinking
of long, strong logins that don’t
include your name, consecutive
numbers or the word ‘password’ can
be a challenge. Fortunately, there are
plenty of free tools that generate
secure passwords. These include
password managers such as LastPass
(lastpass.com) and Dashlane (www
.dashlane.com), and websites
including GRC Perfect Passwords
(www.grc.com/passwords
.htm) and Strong Password Generator
(strongpasswordgenerator.com).
Chrome has a built-in password
generator that suggests (and saves)
randomly created logins when it
detects you signing up for a website.
CREATE IMPOSSIBLE-TO-GUESS PASSWORDS
Other services that use two-step
verification include Instagram, Dropbox,
Twitter, Apple, PayPal, WordPress and
LinkedIn, and most are compatible with
the Google Authenticator app.
Force websites to use secure
connections
Any
website
that
requires
you to
create an
account
should use
HTTPS to
encrypt
your data
both
during
registration
and when
you browse its content. Sadly, many still
don’t bother and either default to their
unsecure HTTP versions or use
a combination of encrypted and
unencrypted pages, which leaves your
account vulnerable to hackers.
To ensure you always get the safest
connection possible, install the excellent
HTTPS Everywhere extension for
Chrome, Firefox and Opera (bit.ly/
https425). This forcibly switches
thousands of sites to HTTPS, whether
they like it or not, and is regularly
updated with new ‘rules’ to safeguard
you against account hijacking. You can
create your own rules so that specific
sites always use their encrypted
versions, and block all unencrypted
requests.
For extra protection, Chrome now
warns you if the site you’re viewing is
using an unencrypted connection, by
displaying an ‘i’ (information) icon or a
red triangle in the address bar – instead
of a reassuring ‘Secure’ padlock. Click
the icon to find out why Google has
flagged a site as ‘not secure’ and to
what degree you can trust it – for
example, it may be fine for browsing but
not for entering personal information
such as passwords and card details.
Disconnect third-party apps
from your accounts
Granting a third-party app or service
access to your Google, Twitter or
Facebook account means you get to try
exciting new tools, but it also opens a
potential backdoor to your personal
data. You may not even remember
which apps you’ve connected to your
accounts over the years, which puts you
at risk if they ‘turn rogue’ and start
abusing that privilege.
To prevent this from happening with
your Google account, go to your My
Account page (myaccount.google.com)
and click the ‘Connected apps & sites’
link under ‘Sign-in & security’. Here,
you’ll see a list of tools that you’ve
granted access to your account,
including details of precisely what they
can access. Select an entry and click
Remove to revoke that app’s access.
To disconnect Facebook apps, go to
Settings, Apps and click the ‘X’ (remove)
icon next to all unwanted entries; for
Twitter, go to ‘Settings & privacy’ and
click ‘Revoke access’. You’ll be surprised
how many apps you tried once and
instantly forgot about!
To turn on this feature,
type chrome:flags into
your address bar, press
Enter, then find the
entry ‘Password
generation’ and click Enable.
Security experts believe passwords
will be phased out completely in the
near future, to be replaced by
biometrics such as finger scanning
and facial recognition, which are
already being used by many services
and devices. However, it’s worth
bearing in mind that this
technology isn’t infallible,
either – a German
hacking collective
successfully managed to
fool both the iPhone’s
fingerprint sensor and
the iris scanner on the
new Samsung Galaxy
S8 (bit.ly/
biometrics425).

ap Puzzle tiles together sections
of maps from popular online
mapping tools, including Google
and Bing, to create a larger, more
detailed image. You can lay details from
one map over another to tailor a map to
an activity, such as taking a countryside
walk, planning an excursion to a big city
or just enjoying a bit of exploration from
the comfort of your armchair.
Once you’ve created a map, you can
view or print it as you would any other
picture on your PC or mobile device.
The software is portable, so you can
run it without installing, but you may need
to install a version of Microsoft’s
.NET framework – this will happen
automatically the first time you run it.

Google Maps - Satellite, 4 which should
be familiar.
2
The easiest way to centre your map
on a point is to enter an address,
such as a town or postcode, in the

You can create maps that show more
detail than usual. For example, choose
‘Stamen - Black & White Map’ 1 as the

Maps don’t have to be useful, they
can just be aesthetically pleasing.

Automatically manage
your PC’s hard drive
2
All your hard drives are listed under ‘Local storage’, 1
and you can see how much free and used space each one
has. Click any of the drives to see a breakdown of how
much space is occupied by temporary files, videos, pictures,
music, documents, ‘System and reserved’ data, and more.
1
You can customise the way Storage Sense works to tailor it
to your specific needs, or you can enable the tool and trust
the default settings. To switch it on, go to Start, Settings,
click System and choose Storage 1 from the list on the
left-hand side. Remember that you need to have the Creators
Update installed.
3
Click an entry, such as Videos, to see which folders those
items are stored in. When you click the name of a folder,
it opens in File Explorer and you can delete its contents
manually. Choosing the ‘Temporary files’ entry in the list gives
you the option to remove junk and empty the Recycle Bin. 1
Click ‘Remove files’. 2
4
You’ll see the ‘Storage sense’ option under the list of
drives. 1 This is switched off by default. Flick the switch
to On 2 and Windows will automatically delete any junk
files from your PC, including temporary files, leftover junk from
apps you’ve removed and anything in the Recycle Bin that’s
more than 30 days old.
C
hances are that your computer is slower now than when
you first got it. This is partly because your hard drive fills
up with unwanted clutter, including temporary files,
cached web pages, old installers and general junk. If left
to accumulate, this build-up can slow down your PC even
more or cause it to crash completely.
Thankfully, if you’re running the Windows 10 Creators Update,
you can use a feature called Storage Sense to get back on top
of things. Storage Sense isn’t new – it’s been available in
Windows 10 since the operating system launched in
2015 (and was included in Windows Phone 8.1
before that) but the Creators Update has revamped
it, making it more useful. If you haven’t tried it yet,
now is the time to see what it can do for you.

Windows 10 (Creators Update)
Wayne Williams says
If you’re part of the Windows Insider
programme (insider.windows.com) and
are running the beta version of the next
big update to Windows 10, Storage
Sense offers further options. The latest
version can automatically remove files
from your Downloads folder that haven’t
changed for 30 days. To set this up, go
to Settings, System, Storage and click
‘Change how we free up space’. It’s likely
that more features will be added in time.

You can now leave Storage Sense to automatically
manage your hard-drive space for you. However, if you
want more control over how the tool works and what
it removes, click the link to ‘Change how we free up space’
under the toggle switch. 1
6
From here, you can choose whether or not to ‘Delete
temporary files that my apps aren’t using’ 1 and ‘Delete
files that have been in the recycle bin for over 30 days’. 2
Keeping both options switched on will free up significant
amounts of space over time.
7
The same screen gives you the option to ‘Free up space
now’. 1 Click the ‘Clean now’ button 2 and Storage Sense
will get to work, providing you with information on the
amount of drive space it has cleaned up. 3 A running total
showing how much space the tool has reclaimed over the past
month appears at the top of the page. 4
8
Click the Back button to return to the main storage page
(or go to Start, Settings, System and Storage). Under
‘More storage settings’, you’ll see two links – ‘Change
where new content is saved’ 1 and ‘Manage Storage Spaces’. 2
Both are worth investigating. Click the first option to manage
where Windows saves new content.
10
Storage Spaces protects your data from hard-drive
failure by saving your files to two or more drives.
This is a great solution if you have a spare hard drive.
To set it up, click the ‘Manage Storage Spaces’ link. In the new
window that opens, click the ‘Create a new pool and storage
space’ link 1 and follow the instructions.
9
On the ‘Change where new content is saved’ screen, you
can choose which drive your PC saves different types of
content to. For example, if you want to store all your
photos and videos 1 on one drive, and films and TV
programmes 2 on another, you can set this up here. Click the
drop-down box and choose a new location from the list. 3

To set up a new profile, click the three-dot menu button 1
and select Settings. Scroll down to the People section and
click ‘Add person’. 2 In the box that appears, choose a
picture, 3 then type a name and choose whether you want to
have a shortcut to the profile placed on the Desktop. 4
2
To switch between profiles, click the grey button 1
and select the profile you want to use from the list. 2
To remove unused profiles, click ‘Manage people’ 3
and hover over a thumbnail. 4 Click the menu button that
appears and you can choose to remove them.
3
Add-ons you install in one profile are kept separate from
your other browser profiles, so you could create a profile
called Add-ons or Testing specifically to try out new
add-ons from the Chrome store. You can manage add-ons
in the usual way from the chrome://extensions tab. 1
4
Keeping separate bookmarks for each profile means less
clutter, so you can keep your regularly used sites
permanently visible and immediately accessible on the
bookmarks bar. To move bookmarks between profiles, import
or export them from the Bookmark Manager. 1
5
When you have more than one profile open, each one will
display a Chrome icon on the taskbar. 1 You can tell them
apart by the superimposed icon you assigned in Step 1.
Right-click an icon to pin it to your Taskbar if you want to
dedicate a permanent link to a particular profile.
6
Your profiles can’t carry their settings from one computer
to another – they’re stuck on the PC you set them up on.
To use a profile’s tools on another PC, create a Google
account for it by clicking the profile name, then ‘Sign in to
Chrome’. 1 Click ‘More options’, then ‘Create new account’. 2
Speed up Chrome using profiles
C
hrome profiles are designed to let different people using
the same PC keep their bookmarks and add-ons separate,
but you can also use them to compartmentalise your tools
depending on what you’re doing. Keeping your bookmarks and
add-ons for work separate from home,
for example, means you only load the tools
you need, which could speed up your
browser and make it less cluttered.

we’ll take you through the steps to set
this up, but it’s worth noting that the
encryption process can take a long time,
so you may not want to start this until
you know you can leave your computer
to get on with the job, possibly overnight.
The project will work just as well on
an old PC. You’ll need to install Ubuntu

How to...
Use a VPN server to protect
devices on your network
Wayne Williams shows you how to use an old or cheap PC to set up
a VPN server so all the devices on your network are protected
What you need
The key component for a VPN server is
a computer. This can either be an old PC
you no longer use or a cheap computer
such as a Raspberry Pi. We’d recommend
running this project on a Pi, preferably
a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (bit.ly/rapi425)
which costs around £33. These mini
computers have all the networking
hardware you’ll need built in; use very
little power to operate; run silently; and
G
rowing numbers of web
users who are concerned
about their privacy or
annoyed about websites
being blocked in the UK are
turning to VPNs (Virtual
Private Networks).
A VPN essentially routes your
traffic through a private
‘tunnel’ so snoopers can’t see
what you’re browsing, and can
make it appear as if you’re
based in another country,
so you can get around
annoying geographic
restrictions, and access sites
and watch videos not usually
allowed in the UK.
You can set up individual
VPNs on each of your
computers, tablets and
mobile phones, but a smarter
approach is to create a VPN
server you can use to protect
every single device on your
network. Here’s what you
need to do.
can follow the same steps as you would
for the Pi (see our Mini Workshop, right).
If you’re installing the VPN on a new Pi,
you’ll also need the following: a microSD
card (at least 8GB); a screen (TV or
monitor) and HDMI cable – though you
only need this during installation;
an Ethernet cable or Wi-Fi dongle to
connect the Pi to your network and the
internet; a USB keyboard and mouse;
and a micro USB cable or power supply

to power the device. You
can buy kits with all the
necessary bits and pieces
but there’s a good chance
you already have some
of the required cables and
peripherals lying around at
home. If you have an Android
phone or tablet, the cable
used for charging it will
power the Pi just fine.
Your Pi needs to be
running the Raspbian Jessie
operating system (bit.ly/
ra425). It doesn’t matter if you opt
for the Lite or Pixel version because both
work fine. We’ll be using the Pixel build
in this Weekend Project, but only
because the screenshots look nicer.
You’ll also need a copy of PiVPN
(www.pivpn.io), which is a version
of OpenVPN designed specifically
for Raspberry Pi (see our Mini Workshop,
below, for instructions on setting this up).
1
From the Pi (or Ubuntu) Desktop,
double-click the Terminal button 1
to open a terminal window. Type
PiVPN’s installation command: curl
-L https://install.pivpn.io |
bash 2 and press Enter. All the
required code will be pulled from
PiVPN, so make sure you’re connected
to the internet. This takes a while,
so be patient. The installation process
will then begin. 3
2
Choose a network interface –
Ethernet is best. Select it and click
Ok. You’ll be asked if you want to use
your current network settings as a static
IP address. Select Yes, unless you want
to enter different details. Select Pi 1
as the user to install the configuration to
(or the default user on your Ubuntu
installation) and allow unattended
security updates.
3
When this is set up, choose UDP as
the protocol, then select the
default port (1194). Accept the
recommended level of encryption. 1
It will take a very long time to generate
a private key. Once that’s done, select
‘Use this public IP’ and select a DNS
provider, such as OpenDNS. Reboot
your PC when asked to do so.
bit.ly/no425 offers a fairly easy
workaround to follow.
Install Rasbian Jesse
If you don’t already have Jesse on your
Pi, go to bit.ly/noob425 and download

– to your PC, then unzip the contents
to a folder on your Desktop. Connect a
microSD card to your computer (using an

Because the Pi will be acting as a
server, it will need a static IP address to
function properly. Go into your router’s
settings (check the manual for how to do
this) and look for something like “static

and process for making a reservation will
vary depending on your make and model
of router, but it’s usually straightforward.

When the Pi has rebooted, open
Terminal and type pivpn add.
You’ll be prompted to enter a name
for the first client you want to use
to connect a device to your new VPN
(‘WindowsClient’, for example). 1
Enter a password twice. You want this
password to be easy to remember
but very hard to guess.

By default, this is ‘/home/pi/ovpns’.
You can copy this to your OpenVPN

to completely delete the message
afterwards, for security reasons).

contents from the folder to the card.
Insert the microSD card into your Pi and
power it up. NOOBS will load. When it
completes, select Raspbian in the menu
and click Install. It will take quite some
time for all the files to be copied over
but once it finishes, you’ll be able to start
using the Pi.
OpenVPN clients
Once your PiVPN is up and running,
you’ll need to install OpenVPN clients
on all the devices that will be connecting
to the VPN. There are lots of different
clients available, but here’s a shortlist
of the best to get you started:
Windows OpenVPN GUI bit.ly/op425
Mac Tunnelblick tunnelblick.net
iOS OpenVPN Connect bit.ly/ov425
Android OpenVPN Connect bit.ly/
ovpa425
We show you how to connect your
devices to your VPN server in our
Mini Workshop, below.
Port forwarding
Go into your router settings and look for
a port-forwarding entry. This may be
located under ‘Advanced’. Essentially,
all you need to do is enter the name of
the application or service you’re setting
up, and the incoming port (or ports) to
use. Choose a protocol type (TCP&UDP,
for example) and the IP address to route
the request to. If you’re not sure what
you need to do, try Googling the make
and model of your router along with ‘port
forwarding’ and you should find
instructions to follow.
PiVPN commands
If you still have your screen connected,
you can type commands into the terminal
window in your Raspberry Pi to carry
out various actions, such as seeing which
clients are connected to your server,
creating additional clients, revoking
a client profile and more.
The command pattern you need to
type is: pivpn <command> [option]
with <command> and [option] replaced
by any of the following:
-a, add [nopass]
Create a client OpenVPN profile, optional
no password
-c, clients
List any connected clients to the server
-d, debug

you hide the scrollbars, making your
browser window less cluttered and
leaving more space for content.
Type chrome://flags and select
Enable from the Overlay Scrollbars
menu. Restart Chrome and go to a web
page that is tall and runs off the bottom
of the browser window. The scrollbar
will no longer be visible so if you want
to scroll the page, you’ll have to either
use your mouse wheel or place two
fingers on your laptop’s touchpad and
pull down or push up with two fingers.
To make the scrollbar reappear, move
the mouse over the right-hand edge of
the Chrome window. If it’s visible but
very narrow, hover the mouse over it
and it will expand to the normal width,
so you can drag it to scroll the page.
At its full width, the scrollbar becomes
semi-transparent and appears over
the top of the page content.

How many times have you filled

your name, email address, home
address and so on? If you find yourself

obile phones have grown consistently bigger over the
years and many screens are now more than five inches
across the diagonal, which makes them tricky to operate
one-handed. Chrome’s address bar (sometimes called the
Omnibox) is at the top of the browser, which makes it even
more of a stretch for your thumb. It would be much easier to
reach if it was at the bottom of your screen.
To move the bar, open Chrome on your Android device and
type chrome://flags into the address bar. Scroll down the
page until you come to an item called Chrome Home, then tap
the button and select Enabled from the menu. A message
appears prompting you to restart Chrome. When it restarts, the
address box will be at the bottom. If you want to move it back
to the top again, return to Chrome Home and select Default.
Move Android’s

Make scrolling smoother
By default, scrolling in Chrome
jumps in steps from one line to the
next, which can be annoying if you
prefer smooth scrolling. You can fix this
via a setting in Chrome. Type
chrome://flags into the address bar
and look (or search) for the Smooth
Scrolling setting. Click Default and
change it to Enabled. You’ll need to
restart Chrome to activate it.
Remove the scrollbars
The scrollbar on the right-hand
edge of the browser window takes
up valuable space if you’re working on

you’re using a wheel mouse or trackpad,
you probably don’t use it much anyway.

More advanced tips for when you’re feeling brave

Enter chrome://flags into the

The next form you come across should
have most of your details entered
automatically.
Instantly create secure
passwords
p
It’s hard to think of a unique
username and password for every
website and service you sign up to, but
Chrome can save you the effort by
generating secure, random passwords
automatically. Go to chrome://flags
and look for ‘Password generation’, then
change the setting to Enabled. When
Chrome detects that you are filling in a
new sign-up form and need a password,
it will instantly create one for you.
Configure Firefox settings
Firefox also provides a
comprehensive collection of
customisable settings that control every
aspect of the browser’s tools. To see
them, type about:config into the
address bar and press Enter. The search
box at the top is the best way to find
specific settings.
For example, type browser
.download.folderList into the
search box. Double-click this entry in
the list and you’ll see that the value can
be set to 0, 1 or 2. Enter 0 to save
downloads to the Desktop; 1 to save
them to the Downloads folder; or 2 to
save downloads to the last folder used.
Now search for layout
.spellcheckDefault. Double-click it
and set the value to 0, 1 or 2. A value of
0 disables spell-checking on text boxes;
1 enables spell-checking for multi-line
text boxes; and 2 enables it for all text
boxes. Option 2 sounds like it should be
the default but it isn’t, because single-
line text boxes are often used for
username and password sign-ins, where
spell-checking is often unnecessary.
Search for ‘network.http.pipelining’,
then double-click to change it from
False to True. This allows Firefox to
make multiple connections to
websites so it can download them
faster. Changing ‘network.http.
pipelining.aggressive’ from False to
True can sometimes provide even
more speed, and enabling ‘network
.http.pipelining.ssl’ speeds up secure
websites that use ‘https’ connections.
Experimental Edge features
Edge has a collection of
experimental settings called
flags, just as Chrome does. Start Edge
and type about:flags into the
address bar to see them.
Unfortunately, most of them aren’t
very interesting or useful, but if you’re
interested in website building, go into
the ‘Developer settings’ section and
enable ‘Show “View source” and
“Inspect element” in the context
menu’. This means that items on the
page can be right-clicked to display
their code. The window is split
horizontally with the web page in the
top half and HTML, CSS and other
code in the bottom half.
Under ‘Experimental features’, you’ll
find a long list of items but only a few
of them will make any noticeable
difference. Under ‘Composition
engine’, select between Release and
Canary (the latter is the more
advanced – but less stable – version).
Scroll down to Networking and tick
the box next to ‘Enable TCP Fast
Open’. You may find this provides
a slight increase in speed when
browsing the web.
Manage memory by
discarding tabs
Do you always end up
leaving a trail of open
tabs when you browse the
web? Each tab uses up
some of your computer’s
memory, and it’s very easy
to run short if you have lots
of open tabs and other
software running.
To combat this, Chrome
can make a judgment on
which tabs are most
important to you, and
‘discard’ those that aren’t.
To see this in action, open
about 10 tabs. After
browsing the web for a
few minutes, open chrome://
discards. You’ll see a list of all your
open tabs in order of importance
(as decided by Chrome). Each listed
tab includes a Discard link.
Discarding a tab doesn’t close it
and you won’t lose the page – instead,
the tab is put in suspension and any
memory it was using is released,
which improves the performance of
your PC. When the tab is clicked
again, Chrome reloads the content
and you can continue browsing.
To take this a step further, you can
switch on automatic tab discarding.
Whenever Chrome detects that a tab
hasn’t been used for some time, it is
discarded to release memory, though
the tab stays in place so you can still
reload it. Go to chrome://flags,
look for ‘Automatic tab discarding’
and change it from Default to
Enabled, then restart Chrome.
Firefox speed tweaks
Here are some more Firefox
tweaks that may make your
browser faster: Type about:config
in the address bar and search for
‘browser.cache.use_new_backend’.
Double-click the item and set the
value to 1. This tells Firefox to use
a different type of cache for storing
recently accessed pages, which
should be faster.
Letting Firefox use more memory
also helps it run faster, especially
when lots of tabs are open. In
‘about:config’, search for ‘browser.
cache.disk.metadata_memory_limit’.
Double-click it and increase the value
from 250 to 500.
Type into the search box to filter the
settings in Firefox and find what you need
Chrome can ‘discard’ (suspend) tabs you’re not
using and keep them accessible for later

Find tablets with ‘Developer
options’
Q
I, along with two other silver surfers,
volunteer to run a free computer
course and café for older people in our
district in Essex. We teach 12 people at
each lesson, using 12 laptops that we
own. Because computing is constantly
in flux, we have decided to put aside the
laptops and
switch to
tablets, which
seem to have
become more
popular, but
people still
don’t know
how to use.
I have
searched the
internet for
inexpensive
Android tablets
that have
a microSD
memory card
slot, a Micro
HDMI port and
the ability to use ‘Show touches’ in
‘Developer options’. Most tablets show
some but not all of these specs, and
none of them mention ‘Developer
options’. We have even asked on the
Android Forums, to no avail.
Our intention is to display what’s on
the tablet through a projector. We need
the ‘Show touch’ option to show the
students where our fingers have tapped
the screen.
Robert Grieve, via email
A
If your Android device supports
Developer tools, you can enable
them by going to Settings, About
Device. You might then need to press
Software Info or something similar. Find
the item labelled ‘Build number’ and tap
it seven times. An extra item appears in
Settings called ‘Developer options’.
This isn’t an advertised feature
because playing around with these
options could cause all sorts of
problems. Most of them relate to
information that can be displayed on the
screen, but it is not something phone
and tablet manufacturers want the
public playing with, so it is hidden and
not documented. The only thing we can
suggest is to go to a large store that has
tablets on display and see which ones
you can enable ‘Developer options’ on.
An easy way to see what is on an
Android tablet or phone is with a TV.
A Chromecast dongle will mirror the
Android device’s screen on the TV and
no cables are needed. We have never
tried this in a café using public Wi-Fi,
but it works brilliantly on home Wi-Fi.
New Samsung TVs, tablets and
phones have a screen-mirroring feature
and you can connect them wirelessly
to mirror the screen: find out more
on Samsung’s support pages at bit.ly/
sams425. Alternatively, you can use
a cable. We found cables to connect
Samsung tablets and phones to a TV
for under a fiver on eBay.
MOBILE
Update phone numbers
Q
I have bought a new phone with
a new phone number. Do I need
to update my Microsoft account with
the changes and how do I do this?
Darren, via email
A
You should update your contact
details on every service that has
your phone number. Not only your
Microsoft account but Google, Apple,
Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and any
other sites you log into. With some, this
is optional but in others it is essential
and may play an important role in your
security. For example, it’s often possible
to use a phone as part of the security
system, such as with Two Factor
Authentication (2FA) or Two Step
Verification.
When you log into the site or service,
a text message with a code is sent to
your phone, which must be entered to
gain access. Even if a hacker got hold
of your username and password, they
could not log in to your account without
your phone. If your phone number
changes, you will need to change the
number used by 2FA or you won’t be
able to log in anywhere that uses it.
It’s a pain, but 2FA makes online
accounts more secure.
Q

You sent us a long list of the actions

you’ve tried everything. The bad news is
that you need to keep trying. We’ve

A side benefit of doing this is that
contacts are often synced with online
services, so when you update online
contact information, the contacts on
your friends’ phones are also updated,
replacing your old number with the new

everyone your new number.

Get files in the correct order
Q
I have a problem with Windows 10.
I open a folder and add a series of
MP3 files numbered Track001.mp3,
Track002.mp3 and so on up to, say, 11.
The tracks are listed in the correct
numerical order but when I add another

puts Track101 between Track001 and
Track002. How can I get the order
I want with numbers and/or letters?
Wilf, via email

It sounds like your files are being
listed in the order in which they are
stored on the hard drive. Files displayed
in Explorer windows and open/save
windows can be sorted by name, date,
size and other attributes, to make them
easier to find.
In an Explorer window, right-click an

What probably happened is that
the app was installed some time
ago when it was compatible with
Android 4.03 but it has since been
updated and the latest version
requires a newer version of Android.
Only the latest versions of apps
appear in the Google Play Store and
there is no way to install old versions.
That old version of Pro Snooker is
gone but a search of the Google Play

alternatives. Many of them are free
and run on Android 4.03. Download

SECURITY
Create secure passwords
quickly
When you register a new account online,
coming up with a strong, secure
password can take some thought. There
are several sites that can generate a
complex password for you very quickly,
such as Strong Password Generator
(strongpasswordgenerator.com),
Password Generator (passwordgenerator
.net) and Norton Password Generator
(bit.ly/norton425). I use the latter, and
you don’t even have to be a Norton user
to create passwords on its site.

Speed up your mouse’s scroll
wheel
Some web pages are very long and it
takes a lot of scrolling to get from the
top to the bottom. To make scrolling
faster, open Settings in Windows 10
(Windows+i) and go to Devices. Select
‘Mouse & touchpad’ and you’ll see several
options. One is ‘Roll the mouse wheel
to scroll’, and you can choose ‘Multiple
lines at a time’ or ‘One screen at a time’.
The former lets you jump ahead a whole
screen with just a small movement of the
mouse wheel, which will get you to the
bottom of a web page really quickly.
If that’s too much, select ‘Multiple
lines at a time’ and drag the slider
to select the number of lines to
scroll down.
In Windows 7, these mouse-
wheel scroll settings should be
in the Mouse app in the Control
Panel. On my PC, I found them
in both locations.
This tip also works with other
things that can be scrolled through, such
as documents.

WINDOWS 10
Add a classic Start menu
If you want to make the Start menu in
Windows 10 look and feel more like
Windows 7, I’d recommend Start Menu X
(www.startmenux.com). It’s highly
customisable, and lets you change its
layout and even add tabs. After installing
it, you can get the best of both worlds by
switching between Start Menu X and the
default Start menu using a simple
keyboard shortcut. Give it a try – if you
don’t like it, you don’t have to keep it.

Create Notepad logs
When you save something in Notepad,
you can set it to record the date and
time. Go to Edit and click Time/Date
(or press F5) to make the option appear.
You can add the time and date at the
beginning, end or both.
To create a Notepad file that saves
these logs automatically when you close
the document, simply open a new
Notepad document, type .LOG as the
first line of text (with no spaces or
characters before it) and save the file,
giving it any name you like. Now, close
the document, reopen it and you’ll see
a log of when it was closed. Note that
if you don’t close the document
immediately after saving it, there will
be a discrepancy between the times.

Clean up your app drawer
Nova Launcher
Prime (bit.ly/
nova425) has a
handy tool that lets
you hide apps from
your app drawer.
This is useful for
hiding apps that
came installed
on your device
but that you never
use, or to prevent
people from seeing
certain apps you’ve
installed.
To hide an app,
open the Nova
Settings app and
tap ‘App & widget drawers’. Swipe up
until you see ‘Drawer groups’ and tap
‘Hide apps’. Tick the boxes for any apps
you want to hide, then tap the Home
button and open the app drawer. The
apps are no longer visible, but you can
still access them using the search bar
at the top of the page.
The Prime version of Nova Launcher
(£3.99) unlocks gestures and unread
counts, and is well worth the money,
but if you want to try using the launcher
before spending any money, the free
version (bit.ly/novaf425) is great, too.

Use Chrome as a calculator
I use Google to perform quick sums
because it saves opening other apps.
However, there’s an even faster way to
perform calculations from your browser –
just enter a sum into Chrome’s address
bar and it displays the result without
even loading a web page. Just be sure to
include the equals sign at the end of your

I use Telegram (telegram

other half and I love that
I can use it on almost
any device. There are
apps for Windows, Mac,
Android and iOS, so if
my phone battery runs
out, I can simply pick up
my iPad or laptop and
carry on where I left off.
This is its significant
advantage over
WhatsApp (www

web app has to connect
to the smartphone app.
One drawback to logging in on
so many devices is that you’re more
vulnerable to snoops. I once left the
app running on an unattended PC
which meant my colleagues could see
all my incoming messages, but I’ve
since discovered you can quit these
sessions remotely from your phone. To
do this, open Telegram, tap Settings
then Privacy and Security. Under the
Terminate Telegram sessions remotely
APPS
Security heading, tap
Active Sessions to see
all your active sessions
listed according to when
they were last used.
Each one displays the IP
address and OS to help
you identify it. Tap a
session and a pop-up
asks whether you want
to ‘Terminate this
session?’. Tap OK and
no one will be able to
snoop at your messages
on that device. You can
also ‘Terminate All
Other Sessions’.
You can also make sure that your
PC or tablet is set to lock after a
period so your messages can’t be
intercepted and, to be extra safe, stop
messages being previewed in your
Android notifications by opening the
‘Notifications and Sound’ menu from
Telegram’s settings and turning off

I don’t bother deleting cookies as

Blow the whistle on phone
scammers
I’m playing catch up
with my copies of
Web User and
just read David
Barton-Smith’s
letter in Issue
422 (bit.ly/
webuser422) regarding BT
phone scammers. We’ve all had them and
I’ve followed the same pattern as he did
– start nicely and end with expletives! It
makes you feel good, but the scammers
still don’t learn their lesson and,
sometimes, if you upset them, they put
you on some form of auto-pilot, which
means someone calls you repeatedly
every ﬁve minutes until they get bored
or you take the phone off the hook.
The answer? Keep a referee’s whistle
by the phone and, if you get bombarded
by scam calls, blow long and hard!
Anyone on the other end will soon be
dancing around the ofﬁce as if they are
being attacked by wasps while they try
to get their headset off as fast as they
can. It may even end their shift for the
day because it’s difﬁcult to make your
next call when your ears are ringing!!

Private browsers should

Having just read your round-up of

I
didn’t know whether to laugh or cry
when I heard about the WannaCry
ransomware outbreak. The fact that
such a shoddy-looking piece of
malware with its modest ransom
demand of $300 could cause such
chaos across the world just proves that
we’re not as technologically advanced
as we think we are. It’s like the massive
alien fleet in Independence Day being
brought down by Jeff Goldblum’s
computer virus!
What wasn’t funny, of course, was
that the ransomware caused such
serious problems at the NHS and that
patients were denied important
operations and treatment because the
computer systems were down. From
what I gather, the attack wasn’t
speciﬁcally targeted at the NHS, but
a consequence of hackers exploiting
WannaCry attack is no laughing matter
security holes in outdated systems used
by companies all over the world. But
there’s a big difference between patients’
lives being put in danger for crucial
hours and some car factory having to
send its workers home early for the day.
The thought that our health service’s
systems are so vulnerable to cyber-
attack is very scary, especially now
that hackers know the trouble they
can cause and, no doubt, will do again.
What also concerns me is that
ransomware is usually triggered by
someone opening an dodgy email
attachment, which causes the malware
to spread over a network. This means
that somewhere along the line an NHS
employee opened that attachment,
or clicked a link or whatever, and
pandemonium was unleashed. I know
the NHS doesn’t have much money,
and that its staff are stretched for time
as it is, but some basic training in
computer-security skills would surely
have prevented this from happening.
Perhaps we should start leaving copies
of Web User in our doctors’ waiting
rooms for them to take the hint!

the last three years for
pictorial family
calendars, which are
easy to download in

calendars are presented
in A4 landscape format,
with all 12 months shown
continuously. This means
you can change the
page size to A3,
rearrange details and
add your own photos. Because it uses
Word ﬁles, you can add family birthdays
and other events. You do, of course, need
an A3 printer to ﬁnish the job.

to hobbyists is the box-template creator

construct gift boxes of all shapes and
sizes. The ﬁles can be saved in PDF or

template can be loaded into Illustrator or

One classic example was the way Donald
Trump (and I am no fan of the guy) was

Same with the Labour Party and Jeremy
Corbyn. The mainstream media sets out
to destroy reputations by publishing
rumours and suggestions, and trying to
plant false impressions in our heads.
Where there is a political motive, we are
going to be deceived.
It’s not just politics, either. Any subject
in which the establishment has a vested
interest to mislead us is foisted on us
daily. As the old saying goes: tell a lie
loud enough, and long enough, and
people will come to accept it as the truth.

Don’t open the doors to our
personal data
I feel I must respond to Gerry Walker’s
Star Email in Issue 423, ‘Online
surveillance is for our protection’. I have
to point out that while it may be all well
and good for our security services to be
able to look at our emails, Facebook
accounts and so on, it’s not them we
need to worry about.
Any backdoor entry or access to
encrypted content will be
immediately exploited by
criminal elements and
unsavoury foreign powers
who often have access to
the most up-to-date and
sophisticated software. The
recent use of ransomware
to cripple the NHS and
other organisations across
the globe is a case in point.
Some of the criminals’
software was highly
sophisticated and stolen
from the NSA.
To my mind, allowing unfettered access
to your data is like asking you not to lock
your doors in case the police need to
check you’re not hiding weapons.
Anyone can then walk in and help
themselves. The modern digital world
has no borders, and the old saying “I’ve

Do you agree? Let us know at webuser@dennis.co.uk
the Guardian, because many NHS trusts
were still running systems based on
Windows XP – an operating system for
which Microsoft stopped issuing security
updates in 2014. Indeed, the NHS paid
Microsoft a huge sum to keep supplying
security patches
for Windows XP
well into 2015,
before it
stopped the
payments.
“For all the
Tories’ droning
on about not
wanting a
coalition of chaos, they’ve overseen
exactly that in the health service, where
computing departments are fragmented
nationally due to the franchised nature
of health trusts and underinvestment is
rife,” Arthur lamented.
I know Charles and he’s a great
journalist, but on this point we differ.
The NHS has had plenty to spend on
IT equipment – it’s just squandered the
money on the wrong things. In fact,
Charles only needs to look back to the
Barry Collins argues that the technology
of the fractured NHS badly needs healing
Page 404
Guardian in 2013 to find a report about
the £10bn wasted on an abandoned
effort to digitise NHS patient records.
Even if this stupidly expensive project
only reached a fraction of the trusts it
was supposed to, what use are digital
records if the computers
that store them can be
knocked out by a
low-rent ransomware
attack? We may as well
go back to filing cabinets.
The problem lies less
with funding and more
with the first part of
Charles Arthur’s analysis:
the fractured nature of health trusts.
There isn’t one overarching NHS IT
department, there are hundreds, and it
would take months just to figure out
how many systems across the health
service are still running Windows XP.
Even when you find them, it’s not as
simple as spending a few million to
upgrade those systems to Windows 10.
One reason why XP is still so prevalent
in the NHS is that specialist medical
applications were designed to run on
that operating system and cannot be
ported to modern versions of Windows.
I took my daughter for a hearing test
earlier this year and the software that
measured the readings was running on
an XP machine. Replacing that
computer might require the department
to replace the entire testing suite, too,
at which point the trust manager sucks
his teeth and says: “maybe we’ll stick
with XP a little longer”.
The WannaCry ransomware has
proved that’s no longer an acceptable
answer. Whatever the cost, the NHS
trusts must now root out those XP
machines and secure their networks
properly. Nobody wants to see an
infected doctor, after all.
What use are digital
records if the computers
that store them can be
knocked out by a low-rent
ransomware attack?
W
e’ve all had medical
appointments cancelled
for various reasons: staff
shortages, ﬂu outbreaks,
a Millwall match in the immediate vicinity.
But you’d forgive anyone for asking
“come again?” when they turned up for
their appointments on 12 May, only to be
told they couldn’t be seen because the
doctor was being held to ransom.
Anyone who’s read Web User over the
past couple of years will be familiar with
ransomware, a decidedly vindictive
form of malware that encrypts your
computer’s files and demands payment
to release them. So why, you might
reasonably ask, did it catch the NHS’s
IT departments by surprise? How did so
many systems fall victim to an attack
that could easily have been thwarted by
the free security software that comes
with Windows?
The answer, according to some
commentators, is money. The WannaCry
ransomware attack that disrupted
several hospitals and dozens of GPs’
surgeries was “an accident waiting to
happen”, according to Charles Arthur in
