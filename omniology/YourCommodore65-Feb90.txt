BUT FIRST
TH S...
A
YC is upon us already, and we
have even better things inside
than before. Not only do we
have numerous games reviews, but
we hove the ﬁrst EXCLUSIVE review
of Liverpool FC - The Computer
Game, from Grandslam
Entertainments. Having been a
Liverpool supporter for my whole
life, it is an honour to ﬁnally ﬁnd the
justiﬁcation to put a piccy of John
Barnes on our cover (you wouldn't
like to know I went to school with
John, would you? Nope, didn't think
so!).
Of course all this is nor all, we
also have the cassette, a superb
collection of four excellent games.
Colour Bind and Araknifoe, having
only been released on disk (via our
incredible Sister title, Commodore
Disk User t he best disk-based
magazine in the entire universe!).
Ninja and Pipeline 2, on the other
hand, have done extremely well in
the past for Virgin Mastertronic, and
we wouldn't like those who missed
them to feel left out (incidentally,
Pipeline 2 was my favourite budget
game ever!).
Other things in the pipeline (coo,
I'm as smooth as Duncan
Goodhew's cranium!) is a new
comic strip (we'll nor be getting rid
of the Nibbles though) featuring
blood, guts, blood, murder and
maybe some computers as well.
There are further, even more
obscure, Desert Island Disks coming
up, with even more obscure people.
More lovely posters. And the Purple
Fish lord promises me that he'll be
even more outrageous in the future.
HI leave you with this joke. Why
did the roadsweeper cross the rood?
To scrape up the dead chicken!
(Sometimes I kill myself. You wish I
would?)

in order to give away some
wonderful joysticks.
The EXOMQX Rocernoker
(worth E26.95) is one of the biggest
joysticks in the world. It has a
variable speed autoﬁre (essential for
those teeth-gritting mega-death
encounters), a cable that is 3 metres
long, and above all else, it looks
and feels just like a ﬂight controller
(with yoke).
The Cobra is as slick as it sounds,
and is a mkroswitched joystick, with
ergonomically designed hand-grip
and loads of buttons.

guaranteed that their

You ﬁnally get a chance in Street Hassle, a re - ease

For the small sum of £2.99, you hay- an arra
of normal(?), everyday encounters to overdome •
your deft ﬁghting moves. One extra featu n o t -  - n
on many other games, is the fact that e  o y e s
available to you change from level to le (watch
for the ear-rubbing technquel).
Also rereleased is Sailing, the old Activision game,
at the affordable price of £1.99. You have the ability
to design your own yacht and sail against other top
countries, in this (to our knowledge) most accurate
translations of the sport.
A Citizen sponsored car has recently won the
famed Lombard RAC Rally. Driven by Pentri
Airikkala, and navigated by Ronan McNamee,
, the Mitsubishi-Oil team sped home to victory in
truly impressive style. It's a shame that Citizen
printers are not quite as fast as their four-wheeled
count

Emlyn Hughes has lent his
name to  another Audio-
genic game. This time it is
not based upon sport, and
is more in the mould of pub
trivia games.
Titled Emlyn Hughes'
Arcade Quiz offers trivial
questions in six categories;
Pop & Rock, Entertainment,
Arts & Literature, People
Ploces ond Pot Luck. You
must progress horizontally
towards a win bar by ans-
wering questions from the
subjects, whilst collecting
fruit and money. If you are
too slow, or fail to answer
correctly too many times,
you will land on the lose
bar, signifying the end of
the game.

The Computer Shopper Show NMII have to ﬁnd a new
venue if it wishes to be run next year. Overall on
the days on which it ran, it attracted 26,658, who
found the heat and the stuffy atmosphere at
Alexandra Palace too much to bear.
One possible venue, sources have indicated, is
the Wembley Conference Centre, and although the
show was basically a box-mover  one, it has already
been rated a lot higher than the recent Commodore
Christmas sho4.1.
In fact, things got so crowded at the Palace,

The latest Tengen game to come our way (via Domark) is Cyberball. It is on American

Set some time into the future, the teams playing have been replaced by robots,

Colour Bind
C
strategy game that will have
you tearing your hair out
before you've reached the end
of it. Solving the puzzles may not be
easy, but you have to beat the clock
as well. As if that wasn't enough, you
can try to improve on the original
design - the game comes complete
with its own construction kit.
The idea of "Colour Bind" is to
work your way through all 20 levels
by pushing blocks of the same
colour together. So all red blocks
must be touching as must all yellow,
green and light blue blocks. You
control a ball with which you push
the blocks. But be careful not to push
them down holes or fall into them
yourself. Dark blue blocks cannot be
moved and act only as an
obstruction.
Filters will only allow blocks of
the some colour to pass over or be
pushed onto them. For example,
only red blocks can be pushed
across or onto red ﬁlters. Screens
have varyuing amounts of time
allowed. When you ﬁnish a level,
timeremaining is turned into a
score. Running out of time means
the loss of a life If you lose all of
your lives on a screen, you will be
allowed to restart from that screen
by selecting option 2 on the title-
page. To start from level 1 select
option 1.

The designer allows you to
create your own levels. To enter the

title-page.
There must be something to
connect on all screens so you may
not change level, quit, play or save
until the ball is positioned and there
ore at least two blocks of at least
one colour.
When you ore happy with your
masterpieces(s) you may save them
to tape or disk. Press 71'. You will be
prompted for a ﬁlename and asked
whether you want to save or tape or

"FT and follow the above
procedure_
When you enter this mode you
will see level one being displayed
on the left, to its right will be a block
containing all 16 items you con use.
At the bottom you will see a counter
showing the level, and next to it the
time that is usually allowed for that
screen.
At this point the computer is
waiting for you to select a level to
edit. Push up on the joystick (Port 2)
to move up a level and pull down
to come down a level. As you do so
the screen will change to show the
new level. When you have got to
the level you want press ﬁre.
You will then see two arrows
appear. One pointing to the top-left
square in the grid and one pointing
to the ball in the object block. The
one in the object block points to the
object that you want to position on
the game grid. You can move the
object pointer using 'CRSR Up/Down'
for left and 'CRSR Left/Right' for right.
When you hove selected the object
you want, move the grid pointer
(with the joystick) to the square
where you want to place the object.
Press ﬁre and the object will be
placed. You may not place any
blocks or holes on the ball or vice-
verso. Only one ball is allowed on
any one screen_ Placing a ball
simply moves it from it's old position
to the new one.
When you have designed your
new screen you may want to
change the amount of time
allowed to complete the screen. To
do this press 'T'. The arrows will
disappear. Pushing up on the joystick

the ball is removed until you
reposition it. If you want to select
another level to edit press t  and
follow the procedure described
above.
If you wish to quit the designer

Aleg, the owner of the plant will
hove bits of his anatomy removed
in ways too unpleasant to think
about_
Trouble is the workshop has gone
berserk overnight and untold hordes
of maniac drills, hammers and
assorted sharp things are wandering
along the pipes, ﬂying to pierce
holes in them.
This must be stopped.
Holes in pipes means holes in
Foreman Fred and our her o is
understandably reluctant to undergo
such radical changes to his plumbing
arrangements. To beat off the
attacks Fred has a gun and an
unlimited supply of willing but dense
assistants (all called Will by the way).
If the tools break through Will con ﬁx
it - if you con keep him unmolested
at the site of the leak long enough
to do his bit with the trusty Irish
Screwdriver (hammer!). One small
complication is that a rival engineer
has tipped the entire contents of His
Royal Personages' insect collection -
most of which ore very nasty, 8
legged pieces of work - onto the
pipes. As you are now about to
assume the role of Fred it is
probably only fair to warn you
about the scorpions.
Get the barrels ﬁlled! The tank at
the top of the screen only holds so
much and you must keep the pipes
intact to ensure that enough gets
through to ﬁll up the required

number of containers. As you
progress up the levels, more barrels
will await you at the bottom of the
screen. You must ensure that they all
get ﬁlled. Naturally, the task gets
harder and the better you get, the
more determined become the
deranged drillers trying to stop you.
To repair a leak you must lead a
will to the spot where the pipe is
broken. To get control of the
workman, simply walk over him! He
will then follow you anywhere! Tools
can be shot off the pipes if you line
up the gun with the target by
positioning Fred correctly. Once the
level in the tank gets low your score
will start to decrease rapidly, and if it
empties out - forget it!
Strategy
You can afford to lose countelss
without loss of points, so long as Fred
remains intact and on the job.
Contact with any of the invading
machinery will knock Fred or Will off
the pipes, with disastrous effects. Use
the workmen as shields if you have

frequently tried to convince
myself that I was writing it as
an aa of self-therapy. Along
with a large percentage of the
population, I am terriﬁed of spiders
and can't even look or photographs
of them without feeling QS if I've
been punched in the stomach. Md
as spiders are frequent visitors to my
ﬂat, this con cause major
inconvenience in my day-to-day
existence.
In most households, the favourite
venue for spiders seems to be the
bath. When confronting a spider in
the both, only the most dedicated
animal-rights campaigner can resist
the compulsion to wash the
offending arachnid straight down
the plughole. I frequently, however,
run into problems with this
technique, as my both outlet is
partially blocked, and the water
does not ﬂow out fast enough to
take the beeﬁer spiders with it.
Often I see a spider clinging to the
edge of the plughole holding its
breath and waiting for the water
level to subside, so that it can come
bounding out again. This has led to
hour-long vigils at the bothside,
shower-attachment in hand, to
ensure that an intruder has really
gone, and isn't just towelling itself off
in the overﬂow pipe before
recommencing the attack.
It was after a particularly long
and harrowing bath-watch, that the
concept of Aroknifoe come to me.
The game is set in the bottom of a
bath. In the distance can be seen
the plughole, a dripping tap, and a
bottle of famous-name dandruff
shampoo. The object of the game is
to wash the spiders down the plug-
hole. by aiming a jet of water with
the on-screen crosshair. Bonus points
are available from zapping the
passing silverﬁsh. Ammunition
(water) is limited, with level
indicators on either side of the
screen. To reﬁll, aim the crosshair
over the drips from the tap and
press the ﬁre button. After clearing a
bath, one travels to the next bath by
a short burst of joystick waggling,
while being chased by a particularly
large spider.
The I or 2 player option is
selected by pressing keys I or 2,
and the game is started by pressing
the ﬁre button (joystick in port 2).
As I said, it seemed that writing a
computer game about spiders
might be a way to purge myself of

my absurd feelings about them
designing 432 spider sprite
deﬁnitions, spending months
watching them scuttle across my

axe-murdering, brain
bashing, kleptomaniacol
slaughter house of a
barbarian and this land in
need has you. As if this
wasn't enough, a wizard of
an evil persuasion, who
has recently risen from the
dead, has vowed to
destroy the kingdom with
the aid of ﬁve magic
gems.
The King must be
desperate because he has
sent for you and named
you as his only hope, this is
because all the previous
questing heroes are now
dead. With a dagger in
your belt and an ego the
size of an elephant, you
set forth. Deciding to stay
clear of the towers until
you gain some nice pointy
weapons and a mail suit,
you visit the local inns. It is
best when conversing with
the landlord to ensure thot
you are in talk mode and
not ﬁght mode, as
skewering the landlord
does not lead to prompt
service. Switching modes
and accessing the other
commands is via a joystick
controlled pointer. This can
be a little slow at times so
be prepared to select the
attack option as peaceful
creatures will wait for you
to talk and a hostile one
will not.
As you wander, the
locals will pop-up (literally)

for a chat. This idle gossip
not only relieves the
tedium of the journey but
provides a few helpful
hints for your barbarian's
continued survival. Visiting
the few scattered houses
will acquaint you with the
various healers and several
generous citizens who will
equip you for your task.
At this point you may
regret buying the cassette
version as it has no map
facility and three fewer
towers. For a well
prepared barbarian the
towers should be a breeze.
Searching dead bodies
provides many a useful
item and introduces you to
the inventory and item
manipulation screen. Here
you see an image of your
character and what he is
doing. For detailed
inventories of the area
around your character and
what you are carrying, you
must access, the drop

be dragged from one
window to the other,
simulating the picking up

original Double
Dragon, and on the
strength of this sequel I'm
rather pleased. The
original story concerned
the abduction of Billy's
girlfriend Marion by Evil
street gong The Block
Warriors', and the efforts of
Billy and his brother Jimmy
to get her back. This
naturally involved going
on a wild kill frenzy and
wiping our the scum that
litter the city streets, etc.
Well, now the Black
Warriors have come back
apparently having been
raised from the dead by
the magical powers of the
one surviving member.
Now they have not only
token Marian again, but
this time they have killed
her (good for them). Your
task is to ﬁnd her. and
discover the secret that will
bring her back to life. Oh,
and while you're at it, why
not indulge in a spot of
mindless violence.
Why not? 'Cause the
game is a piece of doo-
doo thot's why not. It's a
one or two player set up
and you take on the role
of Billy or Jimmy. The
joystick controls direction,
and the ﬁre button will
allow you to punch, kick,
jump and oil that sort of
stuff. Basically you just have
to ﬁght your way from left
to right until you reach the
end of a level. There will
be a selection of different
style baddies attacking
you, and a selection of
weapons to pick up and
use.
All this sounds OK, but
when you get down to
playing the faults start to
show through. The sprite
direction is lousy, you can
easily ﬁnd yourself being
felled by a ﬂying crate that
doesn't come anywhere
near you, and walking into
a wall that looks as though
it's way away from you.
The animation is quite
good and the various
selection of enemy are
suitably aggressive

around scenes from the
ﬁlm. Now the ﬁlm, is pretty
violent, and old Sean and
the boys certainly weren't
averse to a spot of
mindless kill frenzy shoot-
em-up action but maybe it
wasn't quite as bad as this.
Take the ﬁrst level. You
remember near the
beginning of the ﬁlm,
where Ness, all on his todd,
bursts in on Capone's
hooch factory and busts
open the joint? Well
certainly he wasted a few
scumbag booze runners
but in the game he has to
waste a hell of a lot more.
It's a fairly straightforward
platform type game with
lots of crates and things to
clamber over.
The object is to ﬁnd ten
of Capone's accountants,
blow 'em away and grab
the ledgers they drop as
your bullets tear into their
ﬂesh, smashing their bones

and splattering life juice all
over the walls. Very messy,
and not atoll easy. You
see these buggers aren't
daft if you get anywhere
near them they run away
and you have to be quick
if you're going to catch
them. There's also a lot of
little minions running
around and all are quite
keen to take the scalp of
Mr Elliot 'Whiter than White'
Ness. That's you by the
way,
If you manage to gather
enough evidence to ger
onto the next level you
ﬁnd yourself at a bridge on
the Canadian border,
where a shipment of
dodgy Whisky has just
arrived. This is the most
distasteful of all the levels
as the object is not to kill
people but to destroy
booze_ Horrible. By this
stage you have got your
team of Untouchables
together, and there is the
option to swap between
them during the level in
order to avoid getting
blown away.
Levels 3, 4 and 5 centre
around the shoot out at
the train station. In Level 3
you are on your way to
the station and hove to
bottle through the
backstreets avoiding, or
rather killing, a host of
Capone's henchmen
before you get there.
Again you may switch
between which of the
Untouchables you have
under your control, and
hove the option to reload
and all that sort of guff.
Next it's into the station
itself and s ic k o time as
Ness has to stop a small
baby in a pram from
perishing horribly in a hail
of bullets, while
maintaining his pursuit of
Copone's accountant as he
heads for his getaway. Kill
those boddies while being
careful nor to get innocent
bystsanders, and make
sure little bubby doesn't go
hurtling down the stairs.
Then you're onto the
platforms and Capone's
lost surviving cronie has
token a hostage. You hove
just ﬁve seconds and one
shot with which to waste
the baddie, and if you fail
the hostage buys it.
The last level involves
Ness' rooftop battle with
Frank Niti, Capone's right
hand man, but it's going to
take you a long time to
get that far.

and I can't help but agree
with it. The game lives up
to the song too, but
maybe not in the street
slang style intended.
I'm not a great fan of
the mutant singer myself
and taking on the role of
the coffee coloured
superstar holds little
appeal, especially when
the object of the ﬁrst level
is to disguise yourself as a
rabbit. Yes, a rabbit. You
see, young Michael is stuck
on a Hollywood studio lot
surrounded by all sorts of
fans, such as Japanese
tourists, cowboys on
horseback (presumably
leftovers from the latest
Roy Rodgers epic), and
Granny and her Grandson.
You have a radar which
directs you to the various
bit of a rabbit suit, which
you have to collect and
dress up in while avoiding
all the rampant fans as
they descend on you trying
to steal your platinum
discs, Once you're fully
dressed up, and now look
like a total pillock, you
hove to ﬁnd a motorcycle
on which you speed your
way to Michaelsville.
Here you ﬁnd that Mt
Big has seen through your
lapine disguise and has set
the fans on you again. You
must ovoid them all by
collecting orbs which turn
your motorbile into a
sports car, in which you can
ﬂy over barricades, running
down Mr Big's henchmen
on the way. Once you get
far enough you can
escape to freedom on a
jet-ski to Club 30. Here you
have to ﬁnd a gun in order
to wipe our Mr Big's rotten
old troopers and rescue a
load of children from a
fate worse than death.
Mind you, being rescued
by Michael Jackson strikes
me as being a fate worse
than death.
Finally there is the
arena, where all sorts of
laser guns and cannons
are pitched against you by
Mr Big's Guardsmen, as
you battle onward to take
the kiddies to safety.
Personally I'd be more
satisﬁed by joining up with
Mr Big and putting on end
to the little brats once and
for all, but then again
that's not really the point
of the game.
The graphics on this game
are really rather nice, and
when you start playing it
seems as though you are
going to enjoy yourself,
but after ten minutes
wandering around the ﬁrst
level you begin to have
your doubts. The game is
slow moving and pretty
uninteresting at this early
stage and while it's pretty
hard to ﬁnd all the bits and
pieces you need it's also
pretty hard get yourself
killed. The radar screen is
nicely presented and fairly
helpful, but the game is
still boring. The music,
you'd hove thought, would
be pretty integral, but all
you get is a horrible blip-
blip style version of Wacko
Jacko's hits which becomes
very irritating after a
certain amount of time.
didn't enjoy this game
at all, but to be fair, its
pretty enough that an
undiscerning Jackson fan
might think it the best thing
since sliced goats cheese.
Not for me, I love goat
cheese.

BATTLE
CHESS
Title: [Jamie Chess
Supplier: Electronic Arts
Price: £14.99 Disk
Grapple Chess A
or reasons that will
become obvious, the
game is supplied only
on disk and features 2
megabytes of compacted
animation routines that
combine to literally bring
to life normally stale and
static chess pieces. Now the
movie 'pawn takes pawn'
isn't as simple as it sound,
as the losing pawn doesn't
give up without a ﬁght as
they duel to the death.
The fact that the game
also features a
sophisticated chess
program that offers both
2D and 3D views and ten
F
26 4 VC
levels of ploy is almost
forgotten as the animation
takes over. In most chess
games that offer 3D views,
this usually gets switched to
2D as it adds little to the
game. The wind of
change ﬁnally blows,
though.
Pieces now move
according to their type. For
example, a pawn
marches up the board, the
king shufﬂes, the queen
has a sexy little wiggle and
the knight shoves other
pieces out of its way as it
moves to its new position.
The rooks are in fact rock
monsters that stomp as
a Pawn Humps Pawn!
they move and stamp on
anything that gets in their
way. The fun really starts
when battle begins and
each piece match up has
its own sequence of
animation. When pawn
meets pawn ifs a straight
sword fright, but when the
better pieces get involved
the fun really starts. When
a castle is winning it
pummels 115 opponent
with its great ﬁsts, but
topples ond crumbles
when defeated.
The queen uses
powerful magic and either
zaps an opponent or
opens up a pit in the

board for them to fall in.
When the tables are
turned she picks up her skirt
and runs, only to be
caught in the back. My
favourite ﬁght is when two
knights face each other in
combat. The result reminds
me of the Black Knight in
Monty Python and the Holy
Grail as the losing knight
ﬁrst loses one arm, then
the other and then both
legs before he is ﬁnally
defeated.
This is one program to
hove handy whenever
anyone asks you what you
can do with a computer.

FOOTBALLER
OF THE
YEAR 2
Supplier: Gremlin
Price: £14.99 Disk
E9.99 Coss
I
GC1ZZO M0770,
Dazza and myself who
were waiting at our
respective tables when the
announcement was
made. The grim-faced host
slowly opened a golden
envelope, and my mouth
resembled a large
basketball hoop when my
name was read Out aloud.
"The winner of Trainee
knitwear model of the
year is Rik Henderson".
\Vhat a shock Dazza won
The Footballer of the Year
award for the third year
running, but he looked
extremely perturbed that
he had failed yet again to
get the big one.
Footballer of the Yeor
2 expands on the ﬁrm
groundwork that its
arequal laid beforehand.
Footballer of the Year was
good, but not as good as it
could have been. It was
bugged, and its arcade
sequences relied too much
on luck (as did the
boardgame). This updated
version, however, would
never make a
boardgame as it works
almost entirely on the skill
of whoever's playing.
The game is basically
the same as the ﬁrst one.
You must become
footballer of the year by
scoring mega amounts of
goals for clubs and country.
This time though, there is
only one division (the UK
Super league), consisting of
teams like Liverpool,
Arsenal, Rangers, and
Shamrock Rovers. You can
change the names of the
teams involved, but the
league structure remains
the same.
There are goalcords, as
before, although the
method of scoring has
been completely rewritten,
Instead of just hitting the
ball in a direction and
hoping for the best, you
are shown a diagram of
the plan of action. You
must follow this plan in
order to receive the ball,
and shoot into the goal,
hopefully post the
goalkeeper (this sequence
reminds me a lot of Kick
Off and games of that ilk).
If you score enough
goals in a speciﬁc match,
you may be chosen to
play for your country,
which involves competing
in the World Cup. When
you do so, you must score
in each one of your
International games or you
will be dropped. There are
F U N * 1
SOK CADS
also two home
tournaments, and your
Footballer of the Year
chances rely on you
winning medals in these.
There is also a small
quiz section, which allows
you to 'double or quits'
with your money. This is
unbelievably easy and it
makes the game a lot
more straightforward (due
to almost unlimited
amounts of dosh). There
are nine skill levels to
compete on, each of
which makes the opposing
team that much faster,
and harder to score
against.
Footballer of the Year
2 has been vastly
improved in comparison
with its 'older brother', and
in presentation alone it has
moved the old theme into
the 90s, It is great fun to
play, and it is almost as
good as Knitvveor model
of the Year Simulator.

this is the most crucial
time of the year, as the
money they can get from
you to spend will fund all
the development for next
year's games. The ﬁrst line
of attack are the big name
games such as Hard Drivin',
Operation Thunderbolt
and Ghostbusters II. If
you've got any money left
after that lot then prepare
for the second line of
attack, the compilations.
These aim to entice you
with three, four or even
ﬁve games for the price of
one. The compilation line-
ups look even stronger this
year as they contain titles
such as Operation Wolf,
After Burner and Thunder
Diode, all of which
challenged for the top spot
last Christmas.
Everyone's a winner
with compilations. The
software house already
has the games and so only
needs to package and
market it, and you and I
can bag a bargain or
catch up on missed titles.
Since most cost around
612.95 on cassette and
£17.95 on disk, you can
afford at least one blast
from the past.
US Gold
US Gold challenged for the
top spot lost year with the
helicopter shoot-em-up
Thunder Blade, so it isn't
surprising that that features
in two of the companies
three compilations.
The ﬁrst pack, called
Coin-op Hits, is also a tie-in
with Computer And Video
Games magazine (what's
that? - Ed) and features
ﬁve of the top US Gold
coin-op conversions of all
time. Alongside Thunder
Blade there is the 1986
Christmas Number One
Our Run, shootem-up
driving action with Road
Blasters, a rave from the
grave with Spy Hunter (the
game that started all the
road blasting games) and
the Capcom classic Bionic
Commando. If I had to
pick just one game, I think
I'd go for Bionic
Commando, as it's fast,
laser-shooting, arm-
swinging, villain-drilling
action really gives you the
feel of a futuristic
commando raid, Which
would you pidi
news is that you don't
have to choose CIS they're
all available in the one
pack.
Winners is the appropriate
name for US Gold's second
compilation that also
features Thunder Blade,
this time being
accompanied by a
combination of arcade,
ﬁlm and platform action.
The ﬁlm action is provided
by the game based on
Indiana Jones and the
Temple of Doom. Actually,
Ws the game based on the
arcade machine based on
the ﬁlm in which you must
bottle Thuggee guards
through three levels of
snakes, pits and railroad
cars, collect the moon
stones and save lots of
children. Once you've
done that you can ﬂex
your ﬁre button ﬁnger in
Blasteroids and LED Storm
before taking on the evil
Elvin Atombender again in
Impossible Mission II. This is
the pinnacle of platform
games and combines 3D
graphics with all out oction
and joystick jangling
posers.
7670i
Impossible Mission II was
written by Epyx and sold in
the UK through the US
Gold, and so naturally ﬁnds
a place in the ﬁve game
Epyx Action compilation.
Here it is joined by 4x4 Off
Rood racing, Street Sports
Basketball, as well as two
from the famous "Games"
series of games. California
Games offers 8 players 'fun

a series of six events,
including Half Pipe
Skateboarding, Surﬁng and
Footbag juggling. The

and notional anthems. Iris
also one of the best of the
Games games and offers
seven events including the
speed of the Luger to the
stamina of the cross
country race. Perhaps the
funniest is when other
people attempt the
skating while you sit bock,
watch and laugh_

Ocean
Ocean's success last year
surprised everyone,
including Ocean itself as
ﬁrst it topped the Christmas
chart with Operation Wolf,
but replaced that with
Robocop, which stayed at
the top for 30 odd weeks!
That's still selling so you'll
have to wait to see that in
a compilation, but
Operation Wolf heads up
Oceans Mega Mix.

beat-em-up action with
Barbarian II and Dragon

based on the Real

curious about this is that its

four explosive games in
one pack, including the
high ﬂying After Burner,
turbo charged WEC Le
Mans and kung-fu action
with Double Dragon and
Last Ninja II. Two kung-fu
games may sound
repetitive but they are
totally different in style and
gameplay. Double Dragon
is sideways scrolling action
as you systematically beat
up a gong that kidnapped
your girl, whereas Last
Ninja II combines stunning
3D graphics, ancient
marshal arts and
downtown New York
complete with crooks,
drugs and corrupt cops.

Thalamus is another small
software house with a big
reputation and has carved
its own niche in the 'blast
the alien scum' market.
While it produces its next
game. it has released the
software equivalent of its
greatest hits album. Titled
The Hits 1986-1988 it
offers six games for the price
of one, including Sanxion,
Delta, Hunter's Moon and
Armalyte, which all
illustrate the various
permutations of blasting
aliens, as well as hack and
slay action with Hawkeye,
and the abstract but
excellent Quedex that
consists of puzzle after

reﬂexes and mangle your

long before Mac-
Donalds storied
hacking down rainforests
for room to breed cattle
for their burgers, long
before the Tory
Government froze child
beneﬁt, thus depriving
those in most need of a
reasonable level of aid,
and long before the
oceans became poisoned
ond the rivers choked with
the detrius of industrial
production. Long before
any of those things, the
god Osiris wandered
around a lot, being godly.
And everything was just
chummy because Osiris
was the king of Egypt, and
his wife Isis was a bit of a
sexpot. His brother on the
other hand was called Set,
and he didn't like it much,
mainly because all the
children in the city would
chose him and call 'Has
the jelly...*. So Set become
ever more morose and
malignent, and connived
to usurp his half brother,
and take the kingdom,
and especiolly the morally
loose Isis, for himself,
And then the plot
dribbled on and on, until
even die hard Neighbours
fans fell asleep with
boredom. Sufﬁce to say,
the mission is this. You are
the son of Osiris, namely
HOPJS, and you have to
ﬁnd the seven bodily parts
of Osiris in the tomb, Also
down at the bottom of the
tomb (Osiris' QS if you
need guess) lurks Set. who
MST be defeated. Along
the way the hieroglyphs
painted on the walls come
to life and seek to remove
the life from Horus. Horus
naturally can change from
a man to a bird at will,
and can ﬁre magic bullets
or all and sundry.
As well he might,
because the buzzing
swarms of glyphs rapidly
reduce poor Horus'
strength. Unfortunately the
route to Set and the ﬁnal
confrontation is not
straightforward. There ore
lifts and numerous levels.
The lifts require keys or
may not work, so aswell as
scrabbling around trying to
reconstitute Osiris, which
gives you the strength
necessary to defeat Set,
there ore the colour key
and the amulets to collect.
Ah, no one said
anything about amulets
when you offered to take
the job on did they? Well
the amulets bestow mystic
powers, like automatic
mapping, shielding, balls
of dung, strength
resoration. and the power
to destroy everything on
the screen.
There are lots of
amulets in fact, which is a
good idea because the
game isn't particularly
easy. The graphics for the
tombs and chambers are
reasonably good. but with
simple sideways scrolling
and a ﬂat playing area,
Eye of Horus look distinctly
inferior to that other
Egyptian game,
Entombed. Yes, those who
can remember that for
back will doubtless recall
that the Ultimote game
was in a isometric 3-D, and
sported excellent graphics.
It also had very good
gameplay and some
intriguing puzzles. Horus is
far cruder in operation,
and locks that other
game's subtleties.
However, if you like
Egyptian ﬂavoured games,
and tricky arcade
adventures with endless
attack waves of sprites
slowing down the object
collection side
interminably, then I dare
soy you'll love Eye of
Horus. I didn't.

to ovoid you. There ore
other spells to be
collected, each of which
hove a different funchon,

maiden teams up
with a dragon to save the
land. As in all quests an
element of danger is
involved. The reputation of
the dragon doesn't help,
as the local population is
apt to shoot ﬁrst and ask
questions later. As this is on
important task, the dragon
does not hesitate to ﬂame
the odd hostile civilian in its
quest.
As it ﬂies over the land

the odd person, archers
line up to ﬁre. By pressing

as the sequel to this game,
that has certainly done the
rounds, has now been
released (see review
elsewhere). Alrhough the
sequel is for superior in
every way, and is now one
of my faves of the year,
this version is far from bad.
You are on aspiring
footballer, who has the
ambition of becoming
Footballer of the Year. To
do so you must score
goals, in a fairly easy
arcade sequence. To get a
chance of scoring a goal in
a game, you must allocate
a goal card to it, allowing
you one, two or three
opportunities. Other
options in this icon driven
strategy game allow you
to buy a chance card, buy
a transfer card, and see all
your attributes for the
season.
The game has a few
small bugs, and the
arcade sequence is more
a question of luck than
anything else, but it's a fun
game nontheless,
although my advice would
be to save up for
Footballer of the Year 2.

will have failed to hear
the legend of Interplay.
This strange and mystic isle
produces role-playing
classic upon classic and
their latest exploit into the
realms of fantasy stands
proud in this honoured
tradition.
Two of my all time
favourite role-playing
games are The Bards Tale
and Wasteland, both are
Interplay creations and
both inﬂuences show
heavily in Dragon Wars. As
a band of questing heroes
on a watery planet the far
side of nowhere, the last
thing you expected was to
be found wandering the
slums of Purgatory naked
This down surge of luck
leads to an inevitable
adventure and a tole of
blood thirsty revenge.
The game is similar to
The Bards Tale but the
advanced features found
in Wasteland hove been
added to produce a
masterpiece. The playing
area is split into three
areas, one displays the
party view, another the
parry statistics, and the third
comments on your
surroundings. The main
improvements over The
Bard's Tale is a larger view
area, a book of
paragraphs for
atmosphere, the use of
character skills, and an
auto mop function which
produces a map of your
44 1 YC
progress (this is a big plus).
As in all mystic worlds
the arcane arts prove both
a beneﬁt and a bane.
Nothing is more gratifying
than blasting a bunch of
low level monsters with a
ﬂick of a wrist, and nothing
is more soul destroying
than a low level parry
falling foul of a mad
mage. The spells are split
into ﬁve classes; low
magic, high magic. druid
magic, sun magic and
miscellaneous magic. Each
class hos its own speciality,
but most cover the basic
arts of healing and self
protection (by blowing the
head off your opponent).
Life in the slums of
Purgatory has its ups and
downs (mostly downs) and
being trapped there
without resource does not
increase your chances of
survival. Wandering the
twisting alley-ways of the
slum unarmed is a great
way to meet the seedier
elements of the

twinkling of the eye. The
short term wants and
needs of a population
take a bock sear as you
plan for a brighter future.
but ignore the people
completely and you will
ﬁnd yourself out on your
ear.
Sim City is more than
just a strategy game. You
can create your dream city
or tackle some of the
world's more notorious
cities, and their problems.
For city creation there is a
full landscape editor and if
the cash is available, a set
of icons which allow land
development,
Controlling the destiny
of a future metropolis is
nor without its ups and
downs, the odd monster
attack, earthquake and
nose diving planes all add
up to the fun. Ail these
everyday occurrences
hinder but not impede
your city's growth and a
controller with the
population ﬁrmly under
their rhumb should suffer
few problems. If your
control over the citizens is
not so perfect you may
ﬁnd them deserting in
droves or demanding such

minor luxuries as airports,
shopping centres and
pollution free air.
Before tackling the
harsher realities of the big
cities it is best to create a
metropolis of your own,
that way you hit the
problems one at a time
and not head on like a
herd of stampeding
elephants. Before getting
down to the nirry gritty of
construction you must
select your building site. If
the computer does not
generate a landscape to
your liking you can use the
landscape editor to create
your own. Landscape
creation is easy as you can
only work with three
elements, wood, earth
and water. Your ﬁrst action
in creating your
architectural masterpiece is
to bulldoze a tree that you
spent to much time
planting to create a space
for building. Your choice of
construction depends upon
the needs of the people
and the cash available.
The only way to
accumulate cash is through
taxation and it is only by
spending money to
increase your population
that you can increase your
revenue to the amount
needed for a metropolis.
As you can see a certain
ii:
I tzrorrW 4
,
:
contradiction is created, as
careful planning is needed
to avoid the pitfalls of no
funds to meet the
demands of the
inhabitants, Three main
types of building make the
foundations of your city;
commercial, residential
and industrial.
The residential plots are
developed by inhabitants
for accommodation and
the commercial and
industrial provide revenue
and jobs. If a balance is
achieved between these
three forces your creation
stands a good chance of
survival. Unfortunately the
people in this simulation,

as in real life, are a little
more ﬁckle. An extensive
and expensive rood
network must be bult ro
service both residential
and industrial complexes.
This brings trafﬁc jams and
road pollution. Pollution
has on adverse effect on
residential areas so this is
best kept to o minimum
by avoiding trafﬁc
congestion and siting the
industrial base of your city
away from the residential
areas.
The one essential and
prohibitively expensive
additions to your city are
the power stations. These
ore limited in capacity and
must be connected via
power lines to every
consumer. A city can not
function without power, so
the power stations
become a liminting factor
upon your city's growth_
As your city expands, its
needs increase and just
when you thought you
had everything under
control, the citizens
demand something.
Industry is likely to demand
a sea port to improve its
efﬁciency and the forces of
commerce will demand
an airport_ Both of these
constructions place a
heavy strain on your
resources but without them
your city will not progress.
The only way to
increase your tax revenue
without expanding your
city is to increase the value
of the land. By consulting
the various maps and
graphs you can determine
the location of detrimental
factors and eliminate
them. Mother method of
increasing land value is to
place parks and
waterways near your
buildings. With increased
revenue and the
population sated you can
at long last sit back ond
watch your city or ploy
before sending a few
disasters its way. You can
heat up the action by
starring ﬁres or bring the
house down with an
earthquake, but for the
conniosseur you can select
on air crash or the monster
attack.
Having proved yourself
with the creation of your
own metropolis you can
tackle the heavies like the
monster attack on Tokyo or •
the earthquake in San
Francisco
For the tactically
minded, this game
provides unhitherto
reached delights, but the
blocky graphics and the
options excluded in
conversion from the
sixteen bit machines rake
the edge off, producing
yet another game which
could hove been, but
foiled to make the grade.

that old Christmas
favourite. Crossﬁre - the
game that kids up and
down the country got
excited about on
December 25th (I certainty
did) - then you'll recognise
the basis behind Ballistlx.
Crossﬁre consisted of
two ball-bearing ﬁring
guns situated at two ends
of an enclosed board. On
the board were strange
markings, and the idea
was for two players to ﬁre
their beorings (hands up
oil those who thought I
was going to say balls!) at
a larger puck. The winner
would be the one that
could shoot the puck across
the opponents goal line
the most times_
Ballistix owes nearly
everything to this game.
This time we ore whisked
into the future when a new
blood sport has arrived. It is
a game where a ball is
jetisoned onto a pitch with
two goals (one at either
end), and players must ﬁre
a collection of metal balls
or it in order to propel it in
the direction they want
(into their foe's goal). One
problem exists though,
some arenas hove
properties that exist to add
a bit of spice into the
proceedings.
There are also icons
scattered around the pitch,
each of which hove a
different ability (mainly
involving the way the
main ball acts). You con
either shoot your
4•
$;- ,
I
ammunition from an
arrow which you move
around, or from just behind
your goal (like Crossﬁre).
This all applies to the
two player game, but
when you ore in one
player mode, it is almost a
totally different game. This
time only one person can
ﬁre boll-bearings, the
opposition is gravity. It is as
if the area has been tilted
at a steep angle, thus
making the ball plummett
towards your goal at every
opportunity. You must
shoot it into the goal at the
top of the screen a  weird
version of the game but
one that I found
completely boring after a
few short plays.
Bollistix in its 16-bit
carnations. My mind has
certainly not changed
now. To be fair though, the
C64 version is QS good as
the Amiga one, and the
graphics are incredibly well
done. The gameplay is just
the same and I think this is
its downfall. Where
Crossﬁre hod its "ﬁnger on
the trigger" eye to eye
contact, Bollistix has not,
and isn't as furious
as the game on which it
was based. If you ore
looking for game of the
future with great graphics,
plump for Speedball, it's a
lot faster and possibly
more fun to play.

the 19305 starring
Marlene Detreich, but
a far more recent game,
ovedayed on piccies of
female robots. Yes, I know
that a robot is metal and
wires, but these robots
have plumples. Basically
the object of the game is
to undress lots of young
robot women, while
playing a game originally
called Concentration. As
these robots ore rust free
they obviously aren't very
old, so does that make this
game some bizarre form
of paedophillia?
The screen containing
the picture of the robotic
smut is covered by a
network of squares, each
containing a positive or
negative number. Either
playing against a friend, or
the computer, the object is
to move onto the positive
squares, and force your
opponent Onto the
negative ones. The
numbers range from -11
to +II, and one player can
only move horizontally,
while the other can only
select from squares on a
vertical. With the position
marker starting in the
middle, the objective is to
ﬁnish with more points
when all the tiles have
been used up, or if there is
nowhere else on the
current line for a player to
move to. Thus if you are
leading, rather than hope
to ﬁnish ahead or the end,
try to trap the opposing
player in a dead end.
There are numerous
options, all of which add
very little to the actual
gameploy, and cover the
amount of time to make
your move, the skill setting
of the computer player,
whether you want music or
sound effects or a
combination thereof, and
ﬁnally, whether you want
the squares to have only
their numbers showing, not
whether they ore positive
or negative. Obviously this
latter option makes the
game a matter of luck.
50 1 YC
To progress to more
risque piccies, you must
continue to play with all
the settings the same, but
even if you set the skill
level to easy, it rapidly
moves up to difﬁcult after
a few games. Having said
that, I have a version of
Concentration on the Mac,
which would beat the
pants off this game. I can
beat the computer four
tomes out of ﬁve on
difﬁcult level, which rather
shows that the game is

secondary to the quest to
see more and more of the
robot pictures. Getting
through to see them all
will take a great deal of
concentration and time,
probably to such an extent
that you'll be bored witless
by the end.
The actual pictures of
the robots are really
nothing more than
metallic versions of page
three girls, but hardly as
pretty. With chunky low
resolution graphics, and
varying shodes of blue for
the robots, even the diriy
raincoat brigade are
unlikely to feel stirrings in
the cod region,
As a game, Blue Angel
works reasonably well, and
the player options make
life interesting for a while,
but let's face it, with a
tacky underbelly, the
program is aimed fairly
and squarely at sweaty
palms rather than
competitive minds.

which has put a potential
comms user oft it's the
thought of the huge ﬁgure that'll
be at the bottom of the next
telephone bill. Those who don't
think about the money often come
unstuck when the bill lands with a
thud on the hall carpet.
The initial outlay for computer
communications equipment is not
too much, all you really need is an
appropriate modem and some
communications software. But then
you do have to pay the phone bill
every quarter. There are two ways
around enduring the cost of owning
and using a modem, the ﬁrst,
owning and operating a black box
- a device which connects to the
phone line and provides free
telephone calls - is illegal. The
second is on alternative to using the
telephone altogether Interested?
The second method of avoiding
the red letter from BT requires more
money to set up, although the
running costs are nil. The method of
which I speak is radio.

Today, there are millions of ham
radio fanatics all over the world.
New users are transmitting every
day and you don't need robe an
intellectual to be able to use it.
Remember Tony Hancod<s "Half
Hour?".
Many of the new users are nor
the chatty sort though, Lots of them
are simply transmitting and
receiving data from computer to
computer. The system is not new, in
fact ir
being used in America last decode.
It is called Packet Radio.
However, before I continue, I
would like to point Out that this
article is merely a brief introduction.
It has been written to give potential
users an idea of what to expect
from packet radio and further
information should be sought before
you make your decision.
To be able to use the airwaves
you will ﬁrst need some knowledge
of radio and radio frequencies. Not
only will you need this knowledge.

an examination passing and then
buying a radio operator's licence. It
is easy to use amateur radio without
all the knowledge, but if
discovered, you will be prosecuted,
as operating without a licence is
against the law.
Obtaining a licence can be a
long task. You are required to sit an
examination which is set by the City
& Guilds education body. The exam
covers information about radio
frequencies, tuning radio, etc. As
with every learning obstacle, this will
take some time, although you can
study at your own pace and are nor
obliged to enrol on a course.
However, there ore some
establishments which run ham radio
educational courses and many
people ﬁnd them worthwhile.
Names and addresses of some
education institutions are at the end
of this article.
If you feel you prefer to learn
another way, ﬁne. There are many
books on the subject and if you

help. It is always better to hove rhe
knowledge and help of somebody
who has gone through the
experience which faces you.
With certiﬁcate in hand you con
then buy your operator's licence
which will cost a further 612 per
annum.
A  The Yaesu FT- 2 1
In the lace wtth a wet kipper!
To begin trarzsmitting you will need
a fair bit of equipment, most
importantly a radio. Here the
inexperienced will discover the
mighty cost of suitable radios
whereas those NA/ith a bit more
knowledge will ﬁnd that a useable
unit will cost only a few pounds.
To elaborate, a new radio, such
as the Yeasu FT-21111H or FT-71
Will cost you about £250. However
high this price, it is still quite cheap
when compared to some other
more sophisticated jobs. The two
Yeasu radios ore actually very well
red to packet radio and includes
some special features which make
life easier. Jr has a selectable output
of 5 or 45 warts on VHS, and i s a
functional amateur radio transceiver,
which is not limited to being used
with packet radio.

Oh how I love that RS-232 interface! A
If you cannot afford the likes of
The Yeasu range, you should read
the classiﬁed adverts in the specialist
radio publications like YC's sister
moge, Ham Radio Today, you will
know that buying a second hand
unit will cost considerably less. If you
intend a radio rally, then

considerably less may become just
a few pounds. But, such a radio is
unlikely to work from the off and is
almost certainly going to require re-
tuning. I am told that re-tuning a
radio is easy, but I've been talking
to experienced radio buffs who
know what they're about. Unless you
are conﬁdent and competent
enough to tune the radio, I strongly
suggest that you take it to
somebody who is, Your local radio
ship should be able to do the job for
a small fee.
Like telephone communications,
packet radio requires a modem to
modulate and demodulate the
signals, If you've got a
telecommunication modem
already, then sell it to make up the
money for a new modem which
v  What? Surely they can't wrap thousands
Advanced Electronic Applications, Inc
uses a different system. Because
radio transmissions are different
from electronic pulses going down a
wire and you need alternative
technology to be able to handle the
frequencies. Your new modem
should be a terminal node controller
(TNC) and there are quite a few on
the market.
Ranging from quite cheap to
damn right expensive, a TNS is your
modulating gateway to the west,
south, north._ etc, Like I said, there
are enough INC modems on the
market to be able to make some
kind of choice. Many of the
modems I shall metnion are
compatible with the Commodore
64, and I shall indicate which ones
will interface correctly.
If you are on a right budget the
Pac-Comm Tiny-2 INC modem will
be quite appealling. Reasonably
priced at El 19, the Tiny-2 is
compatible with VHF only, although
has a TTL interface so that it will work
with the C64. The Pac Micro Power 2
is a miniature version of the Tiny-2
and can be run off a solar cell if
needed. It too is Coel compatible.
Up the price scale slightly is the
TNC320 which enables both HF and
VHF communication. This one retails
of bags of crisps in that little machine!

at 6179. If you want to

the new miniature Handy Packet

produce two units. The ﬁrst is the AEA
PK88; it costs around £130 and runs
on both HF and VHF wavebands but
is nor CM compatible. For £279,
the AEA PK232 is the deluxe model.
It works with packet, RTTY, CW,
Arnror and ASCII which ore all
different protocols. Again is both HF
and VHS compatible and is not for
the Commodore 64.
Another range of TNC modems is
from Kontronics. All of the Kantronics
modems have a TEL port and con
be connected directly to the C64.
The KPC-2 is on HF and VHF INC
which includes the WEFAX facility. It
retails at E165. WEFAX is the
weather facsimile system that
transmits satellite weather pictures
direct to your Commodore 64. The
KPC-4 is another HF and VHF unit
and also has a WEFAX and radio fax
features. The extended capability of
the KPC-4 is reﬂected in the price,
E242.
Connecting one of the above
modems to an Amigo is simple. All
ore R5232 compotible and so a
standard lead will do the job.
Connecting to a Commodore 64 is
also possible on many. Those which
include a ilL parr as standard
connect to the 12x12 user port or
the rear of the C64.
You will also need an antenna to
be able to transmit and receive. If
you are using VHF one, the aerial
need not be too large. Technology
today has made aerials shorter. For
the best aerial for your radio and
location consult a dealer who will
be able to provide the most up to
dare unit. Aiso if you are unsure
where to site it, most dealers will ﬁx
it for you.
Software is nor a real problem.
Commodore 64 software is quite
easy to obtain. Most any standard
communications program will work
quite happily with pocket radio.
Now some brief notes on packet
radio frequencies. Packet uses
speciﬁc frequencies which hove
been set aside for data alone. The
most common frequency is on VHF
and is 144.650MHz FM. Here you
will ﬁnd many one-to-one
conversations going on. This channel
is also very busy. Other used
channels ore 50MHz, 70MHz,
432MHz. 1296MHz and 432.6MHx.
On high frequency, 14.10MHz is
quite popular.
Packet radio is very similar to
using the telephone and a modem.
A  What a hairy creature!
There ore hundreds of bulletin
boards out there_ The operation of
them is simple and they exist as
message bases and ﬁle transfer
stations.
If you would like to get involved,
a second-hand set-up could cost as
little as E130_ A PYE Westminster
radio is ideal for packet radio and
would cost only about £30. A
second-hand INC such as the Pac-
Comm Tiny-2 would typically cost
about Loa You would then need
software, much of which is public
domain, a power source and on
aerial.
Of course, the advantages of
packet over telephone links for
outweigh the cost to set it up.
Satellite links can carry your
transmission around the globe -
there are four satellites orbiting the
earth solely for radio transmissions. It
costs you nothing to run the system
and you get to talk to all sorts of
people from many different
countries.

here's always a point in dealing
wirh computers where techno-
phobia takes over from techno-
warship: suddenly you ﬁnd
yourself needing a gizmo for the
whorsir, using a thingummijig to
make the so-and-so wok and
requiring a watchamacallit to
connect all the bits 'n' bobs to the
doodah. What you can't control
makes you feel stupid, and to some
extent, threatened.
This is similar to one kind of
attitude to computers portrayed in
ﬁlms and books over rhe last ﬁfty
years. The other is that they ore
going to make life immeasurably
better in the future - in short, they'll
have a use (even if it does only
mean speeding up the tea-making
process by 0.174 seconds). Because
people aren't sure about just how
computers will affect the future, the
media views shufﬂe about uneasily
between optimism and pessimism.
Usefulness is seen in two ways:
computers can provide a valid form
of escapism, and they can also give
your body a good, ﬁrm wash and
rub-down (as in the Insignia all-over
body program ad). Some of the
uses are just plain silly. In Electric
Dreams, Miles computer, Edgar, is
roped into penning soppy tunes for
his user's would-be girlfriend, but
then falls RAM over ROM in love
with the girl himself. Edgor turns out
to be so human he becomes selﬁsh
and boring in his desire to discover
the essence of true love. The truth is,
there ore countless more mundane
ways in which computers are seen
to serve people: neurosurgery,
cashpoints, collecting the poll tax,
guiding nuclear missiles, calculators.
Then there are games. Games as
a whole have been largely ignored
by television and ﬁlms: Than and The
Lost Storﬁghter had scenes with coin-
ops, but there have been very few

TV programmes which even cost a

This is despite the fact that Nintendo,
the world's most successful games
Bishop - Aliens

YC 5 7

company, is rumoured to have sold
50 million console units worldwide.
Science Fiction has been less
reticent: Cyberpunk stories revel in
cyborgs, brain-computer interfaces
and artiﬁcial intelligence: theirs is a
world that coolly wants the touch of
technology dose to the skin, the
fusion of human mind and machine,
New and imagined designer
techno-gadgets are peripherals to a
chip-based philosophy.
The biggest thing you can
escape to is another dimension, and
some games try to give you that.
There ore those that act as life
simulators, allowing people to do
things they would never otherwise
be able to do: mash people and
play God in Populous, unleash
"Open the bay doors Hal!!" A
monsters on SimCity, reﬁght epic
battles in UM5. Simulated violence is
part of the success of leisure
software: it's one of the biggest thrills
of these altered states: to kill without
guilt simply because the victim is a
few pixels on the other side of the
screen.
On the aesthetic side, computer
art con produce and manipulate
images that wouldn't be seen
anywhere but on a computer
screen. The powerful purity of Tron's
landscape couldn't have been
captured by standard stop-frame
58 4 YC
animation techniques. The uses for
sophisticated graphics and small-
scale simulations in industry are
almost limitless; the potential for
simulation is only limited by the
power of current technology, not by
imagination.
In ﬁlms, these alternative worlds
ore seen to pose a threat. In
Westworld, a holiday resort of
popular fantasies (ancient Rome,
medieval times, and the Westworld
of the title) is designed and run by
computers. It's the ultimate theme
park until one of the androids (Yul
The Last Starﬁghter - teen sci ﬁ. A
Brynner) rebels and chases,
relentlessly, after one of the tourists,
intending to exact revenge. It's a
warning against dependence on
technology alone, and the potential
for failure amongst the most
sophisticated computer systems.
Fear of failure is the primory
threat posed by computers. Films
such as 2001: A Space Odyssey
pose the problem that because
humans write the programs, there's
always a likelihood that programs
will come across unresolvable
situations, and go 'mad' as a result.
This is the basis for many of Asimov's
Robot stories, and the heart of HAL's
dilemma. HAL (Heuristically
programmed ALgocithmic
computer) receives orders which
contradict his program: his mission
changes, a mission which suddenly
sees human elements as a danger
to its success: so it decides to kill
them. Only when it's disconnected is
the threat revealed for what it was:
HAL was a simple machine
following orders. Ash, in Alien,
follows a similar pattern. The human
members of the Nostromo's team
ore dispensible, the alien is not. The
cold logic of a computer brain
(and the minds of those who gave it
the orders) allows no place for
compassion, only for what is right
according to a predetermined
routine.

ol
it
A metallic version of Dirty Harry - A
Pobocop, designer violence.
In The Fly, Brundle's program for
his matter transporter doesn't
compensate for the presence of two
creatures in one transporter, and
(quite logically) during
transportation mixes the two on a
genetic level to create a new unit.
Passive computer error is often seen
in terms of horriﬁc results: in
RoboCop, the ED-209 enforcement
droid, paraded as the latest in
advanced technology, malfunctions
or its unveiling with disastrous results.
The cyborg created as an alternative
(RoboCop himself) is seen as o
more feasible solution because he is
or least partly human. He's
controlled by three 'Directives'
similar to Asimov's Laws and has to
solve the contradictions between
them. It's not easy being a machine.
Computers ore also seen as a
weapon to be held against us by
faceless powers. Worgomes suggests
that one mans cynicism could lead
to the destruction of the entire
human race; media stories about
the 'dangers of hocking echo a
similar story on a smaller scale. Tron
ASIMOVS LAWS OF ROBOTICS:
The way in which people's ideas
about robots can be shaped by
ﬁction is seen in Asimov's Three Laws
of Robotics. Asimov, a former
chemistry student turned legendary
SF writer, wrote a series of short
stories in the 1940s which set out to
prove the difﬁculties of imposing
such simple conditions on complex
machinery. Since then, however. the
Lows hove been widely regarded as
being a sound base on which to
create artiﬁcial intelligence. They
ore, in order of importance:
1. A robot must nor injure a
human being, or, through inaction.
allow a human being to come to
harm.
2. A robot must obey the orders
given to it by human beings. except
where such orders would conﬂict
with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its Own
existence as long as such protection
does not conﬂict with the First or
Second Law.
59

warns us that when we create an
artiﬁcially intelligent computer (ie,
one that can actually learn, rather
than merely compute) we don't
really know what we're letting
ourselves in for. One of the most
chilling moments of the ﬁlm is the
MCP's glib comment in reply to
DiIlinger's 'I wrote you': 'I've gotten
2,415 times smarter since then.'
One ﬁlm stands out as an
examination of what it could be like
to live with free-thinking, artiﬁcially
intelligent computers in the future:
Ridley Scott's Diode Runner, itself
based on Philip K Dick's novel, Do
Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? It
sees the world as much the some
place as it is now, only
exaggerated: the buildings are
larger, the gutters dirtier, the
attitudes to violence more
indifferent Most of the population
has left for outer space, leaving only
the misﬁts and decadents behind.
Five runaway androids from an off-
world colony illegally escape to
earth, and the Blade Runner
(Harrison Ford) is sent to seek and
destroy them. It turns out that the
replicants' leader (Rutger Hauer)
6 0 4 C
Arnie at his beefy best in 'Terminator'
was only searching for a meaning to
his own life, Trying to discover why
he must age and die. Fords mission
to kill turns to sympathy only when
Hauer spares him his life. What kind
of attitude can people have to
androids when the androids are so
like themselves?
When Gary Kcisparov recently
beat the world's most sophisticated
chess program, Deep Thought, his
attitude was typical of current
attitudes to computers - they'll
never equal the human brain: 'I hod
to challenge Deep Thought for this
match to protect the human race.'
Current technology doesn't even
begin to approach the sophisticated
levels envisaged by 20rh century
futurists. Computers can barely talk,
and have great difﬁculty with
speech recognition; they can't 'see'
objects of any complexity; they
have no true interaction with the
outside world. True androids - Blade
Runner's 'skin jobs - are far enough
away for the impact of computers
on society to be a soft one. What
the predictions of today's media tell
us is that we need to understand
and control our technology before
we can fully trust it. Like its creators, a
computer isn't infallible.

I've noticed recently that ELSPA's
piracy campaign has been stepped
up. I am a so-called 'pirate',
although I do not sell products for
money, I only copy games off of my
friends because I cannot afford the
prices that they are sold at.
Does this mean that if I'm caught
I'll be locked up?
Captain Pugwosh, Brixton
PA: I knew a pyrate once, it's a
terrible job to 'of to do. And if you're
caught, well I wouldn't build up too

worrying about getting caught is to
stop committing the crime. Buy YC

y
column back again to help all
troubled gamesters, and your
host, as usual, Kirky Baby. This
month I have a superb Batman Mop
lovingly drown by Jack Rutter (my
bro) plus hints, cheats and pokes to
get the juices going!
BATMAN THE MOVIE (Ocean)
64 4 VC
LEVEL I
Bombers are a pain in the ass. When
you are being otradied from
above, the best thing to do is shoot
the batrope under the bombers feet
and climb up it. By the time you are
level with him he should have his
back to you, just begging to be
zapped. Cops are not as nostie as
bombers.
Shoot on sight, if there is one
behind and in front of you shoot
one then duck, wait until the other
hoodlum ﬁres and then let him
have it. Jack Hapier is guarded by a
mod bomber, you'll need at least
half your energy to ﬁnish this section.
Once the guard has been disposed
of, one swift shoot is all that's
needed to rid the land of Jack.
LEVEL 2
Time is precious so don't hang
around. I found it was only possible
to complete this section by driving
top speed at all times! Sounds hard
but staying to the centre lanes
makes life a little easier for you. The
best route to the Batcave is to take
the 3rd. 5th, 4th, orh, 3rd, 3rd, 3rd,
oth, and 3rd corner.
LEVEL 3
I didn't like this level much, bur who
cares? I think you can ﬁgure this one
our for yourself, it's easy!
LEVEL 4
Keep to a steady height (centre of
the screen). Keep up a fairly fast
pace so the batwing is still quite
mobile in tight situations. As you
approach the balloons, reduce your

V
speed slightly in order to Judge the
height of the ballon, if you think you
are going to hit it AVOID it as time is
not so tight on this level.
LEVEL 5
God this is a tough level! The
gameplay is almost the same as the
Axis Chemical Works, but instead of
working across you have to work
your way up, this makes life harder
for poor old Batman.
Watch for collapsable platforms,
when they start to change colour
get the hell out of there. Also be on
the lookout for spikes, simply swing
over them to get by. Killing the
Joker is not so hard, when the
grinning madman comes in to sight,
zap him with the batrope then
pump him full of bat logo's.
BIASTEROIDS (Image Works)
POKE 11571,173 will give you
inﬁnite lives.
SYS 25856 will start the game.
Yet another Ocean game receives
the Hackatak treatment.
General tips: A good supply of
glenades oon be cbcoined by tooting
the nurses (oh, bit o politics there -
ED) as they carry dead marines off
the screen, But try and use as little
grenade power as possible as you'll
need them for the end-of-level
nastie.
LEVEL 1
To take out the huge gunship, try
taking it to a nice picnic spot (Get on
with it! - ED). Use every last grenade
(hold the space bar down) Then let
rip with the machine gun whilst
avoiding the bombs, After a few
seconds you should be loading level
2.
Those of you who haven't got
what it takes to reach the higher
levels, try ignoring the REWIND TAPE
message and leave the tape
playing to see all the luvly levels. By
the way, make sure you die on
level 2 otherwise the cheat will nor
work.
The festive season draws to a hair
and so, I'm sorry to say, does
Hackatak. Never mind though
because we'll be back next month
with another selection of hints,
cheats and may be another map! If
- 5taet
(ocliAc
you've got any tips send them to
me, and if they are good enough
we will print them and pay you
absolutely nothing, er I mean you
could win a fabulous prize. Bye!

computer products is, in my
opinion, the most useful
peripheral to arise for years. Not
because it has multiples of
applications, not because it performs
wonderful tasks, but because it
successfully performs a regular
function that is essential for all
cassette users.
Some games hove complicated
Turbo loading systems, designed to
prevent piracy, and many of these
systems rely on extremely accurate
alignment of dataserte heads,
therefore, unless your datasette is in
perfect condition, you may ﬁnd
difﬁculty in loading. The Load-it has
two functions that, when used
together, ensure that you will have
a higher percentage chance of
software load.
The ﬁrst is the LED panel. This is a
bar of small LEDs that show the
strength of signal being received.
The second is a small knob that
aligns the head. Combine them
both, and you have a system that
always allows for the maximum
signal off of any tape.
I personally have two
Commodore datasettes, both of
which work on many games, but
they always have problems with
Ocean software (which uses a
sophisticated Turbo loader), the
Load-it worked every time. Md
after extensive testing on all the
software that would never load on
my existing machines, the Load-It
had a 100% success rate.
The only unfortunate point about
the Mills product is its price: E
(Inc P&P). This is a little steep,

although if you buy one before the
30th of January you get a free
video (Top Gun, The Living Daylights,

you want your tape based software
to load every time, or not!
Alternatively you can win one in our

Audiogenic. Rik
Henderson meets the
man, and discusses his life,
the universe and little
Emlyn.
72 4 YC
1
The time: About 1.30pm on a cold
November afternoon.
The place: Downstairs on a
chartered Audiogenic bus,
somewhere between Oxford Street
and Cricklewood (Emlyn goes to
Cricklewood).
Rik: You've Left A Question of Sport
and you've done one series of
Sporting Triangles. Hove you got any
more plans?
EMLYN: Yep, certainly! We've got a
new series of Sporting Triangles
starting in February, which this year,
has been increased from thirteen
weeks to ﬁfteen weeks, but it could
be seventeen weeks, I'm not sure.
I've also got a new series of Combat
which I did with Anneka Rice and
the army, It looks as though there's a
new series of that starring at the
back end of February. And it looks

as though I'm going to be involved
with the IIV for the World Cup
coverage from the ﬁrst week in June
to about the second week in July, so
the next six months are going to be
very, very busy for me in Television
work, which is great for me in terms
of personality, publicity and
promotion wise, but it's actually
madness. Seven days a week,
travelling all over the country,
promotional, interviewing, radio,
working for ball companies, things
like this (pointing at the
surroundings), promoting games
that I'm involved with. Its all
madness, it's bonkers.
RIK: Is that why they call you "Crazy
Horse"?
EMLYN: (Laughter) "Crazy Horse" is a
long, long story, but a shortened
down version of it is that I was a
nutcase on the football ﬁeld I would
have done anything on the football
pitch to win a game. I would have
done anything,. I was absolutely
barmy! But that's a shortented
version of it, I was crazy!
RIK: Yeah, I'm a Liverpool supporter
myself!
EMLYN: Are you? Well done son,
good lad!
RIK: On the computer side, your son
plays games. Does he play a lot?
EMLYN: Very, very much so. I
honestly don't have the time myself.
I'm never home anyway because
I'm always travelling. And when I do
get home I tend to put my feet up,
or go for a bite to eat with the
missus and the kids. But our Emlyn -
and Emma, she's the eldest, she's
nearly seventeen - is permanently
on the computer, to be totally
honest with you he's a ﬂaming
nuisance, because he's on it too
much. He's playing with it twenty
four hours a day when he should be
studying and he should be working
hard at school. I'm not saying he
doesn't work hard at school, but he's
on it too much. He always plays the
games, I mean he always plays the
International game.
RIK: Do you think he'll be playing
the Trivia Challenge when it comes
out?
EMLYN: I feel certain he'll be playing
it because I'll make him play it. If it
means he's going to learn
something from it, yes, he will
certainly be playing the Trivia game,
Now if you wanted to do my top
ten computer games, I'll certainly
say number one's International
Soccer. Number two's going to be
the Trivia game, so if you want to
ask Peter (the head of Audiogenic),
I'm sure he'll give you the other
eight to odd on the top of that. So
get the other eight off him and
you'll hove my ten.
And so the bus drove on into the
sunset, and Emlyn was left to
organise his thick lump of a diary.
Me? I sat and contemplated what it
must feel like scoring a goal for the
Reds!1111111111111111111

Kati Ho mzo
wades rhrough the quagmire
of computer games with no morals_
AL
p
sim, shoot 'em up, adventure,
RPG, even chess - you name it,
chances are it's violent. Some
kind of destructive element is part
and parcel of practically every
computer game from PacMon to
Populous, from Asteroids to ZOrii.
And let's fact it, it'd make for some
terrible turkeys if the violent element
had to be completely cut out.
What kind of a game would
Space Invaders make, if instead of
blasting the little green monsters,
you had to jettison miniature peace
treaties into outer space? Imagine
Batman wihtout the Joker. Op Wolf
with the UZI cut out or Gauntlet
minus ghosts. Like it or not, some of
the best games around - Barbarian,
Bartle Chess, Dungeon Master,
Strider, Robocop - are extremely
violent, and its the violence which
makes them so much fun.
So what? you might think. A bit
of punching here and there or a
pixellated sub-machine gun isn't
going to do any harm. No perfectly
normal, happy-go-lucky kid is going
to turn into the Incredible Hulk
overnight. just because he played a
game of Spoce Invaders.
Fine, but there are some people
who disagree. Whether games
should or shouldn't contain violence
is turning into a pretty violent
debate in itself. In one corner we
hove Mrs Mary Whitehouse,
heavyweight champion of morality,
and in the other is most of the
computer industry and the people
who play the games. If you've got a
computer and you've enjoyed
products like Platoon, Better Dead
than Alien and Technocop, the
7 4 ' I T
ogrument may look pretty black
and white to you. But is anything
ever really as simple as that?
When Mrs Whitehouse and her
supporters turned their attention to
the contents of computer games
they were shocked. All those
Commodore 64s, BBCs, STs and
Amigos which were bought by
parents in the hope that sprog might
use it as an educational machine
turned Out to be running extremely
1

iffy software. If you're not hiking
around killing people (lkari Warriors)
or sticking knives into natives' backs
(Rick Dangerous), you're running
military campaigns in politically
volatile areas like Russia (Red Storm
Rising) and Vietnam (Platoon). In a
world in which the crime rote is
soaring, they reckon that all this
graruitious violence enforces the
dangerous view that might is right
and through is Out. At the very least
they wont censorship; at their most
extreme they want violent games
like shoot 'ern ups totally banned_
On the one hand their argument
completely misses the point. Firstly,
in most games you're not thinking
about the scenario or the identity of
your enemies; how to get post the
next wave of Alpha Centaurians
when you lost your mega bazooka
space blaster ten seconds ago is
much more important. Whether
you're shooting at a Russian, a
Korean or a little green man from
Outer space isn't the issue. You could
still enjoy Red Storm Rising if you
were head honcho of the KGB.
Secondly, the anti-violence
campaigners assume that garners
won't be able to draw the line
between ﬁction and reality.
Somewhere in the middle of the
game, what's on the screen and
what's happening in real life will
become the same thing. In fact it's
probably easier to distinguish a
computer game from reality than a
ﬁlm or a particularly violent
programme on TV. A pixellated
sprite, however fantastic the
graphical capabilities of your
machine, isn't going to be as realistic
as a photograph. RoboCop on the
big screen is hardly the some as
RoboCop on your 64.
On the other hand, Mrs
Whitehouse and her cronies may
have hit on something of a point_
Obviously, you're not going to walk
out of your house and machine gun
the residents of Acacia Avenue after
a game of Operation Wolf. But the
inﬂuence a game has over you,
especially one that's set in a
contemporary scenario rather than
on obviously ﬁctitious world, could
be a lot more subtle than that. The
target of your submarine strategies
in Red Storm Rising may be
irrelevant to the gameplay but that
doesn't alter the fact that it's still a
Russian target. The scenario might
nor be actively encouraging you to

think badly about Eastern Europe
but it's not exactly inviting you to
think well of it either. If you've
already got a bad opinion of
Russians ifs only going to be
reinforced by the gameplay. If
you're too young to be interested in
politics this might be the only view
of Russia that you've got - and it's
not exactly on unbiased one.
Censorship isn't such a black and
white issue either. There are some
subjects which almost everyone
would agree are unsuitable for
games. You might not think Russia
qualiﬁes for that, but what about the
fascist games which were doing the
rounds in Germany earlier this year -
games which involved you taking
the role of concentration camp
commanders and had you shooting
Jews and setting dogs on escaping
prisoners? A parallel over here
would be a shoot 'em up which had
you playing the IRA and knocking
off members of the armed forces in
Northern Ireland, If that's in bad taste
why isn't dropping bombs over
Russia?
You may think games supporting
Nazis should be banned and games
slumng Russians should'nt. If that's the
case, how are you going to deﬁne
where the censors should draw the
line? And if some games deﬁnitely
shouldn't be allowed on the market,
who should make that decision?
Should leisure software be subject to
some kind of rating system, like
ﬁlms, or should it simply be a case of
rusting to the integrity of the
software publishers? As soon as you
76 1 YC
start to admit that some subject
matter or game concepts are
unacceptable, you've got to
consider whether or not that justiﬁes
regulating against them. And that
leads you into all sorts of complex
questions like freedom of
expression, freedom of the media,
whether or not it's right to censor
anything, even whether censorship
works at all. What started out
looking like a pretty straightforward
debate can end up getting
extremely complicated.
Anyone who enjoys computer
software knows that Mrs Whitehouse
is exaggerating. As long as you
don't start mixing up fantasy and
reality there's nothing wrong with a
bit of violence on your monitor. But
like everything else, it can get out of
hand and there is scope for
exploiting dubious subject matter. In
many ways the best people to
judge the effects of computer
games are the people who know
most about them t h e
gamesplayers. In the end, where
you stand in the argument is entirely
up to you. Just remember there are
subtler factors ro consider than
whether or not a game makes you
want to go out and kick someone's
head in. Oh__ and if you do start to
feel and uncontrollably violent urge
in the middle of a game of Space
Invaders, switch off your computer,
put on a strait-jacket and consult a
psychiatrist - fast.
VIOLENT TYPES
BARBARIAN II - a deﬁnite blood and
gore hack 'em up famous for its
excellent violent effects. The
opponents are monsters rather than
people; having your head snapped
off by a ginormous chicken is total
fantasy. Not much chance of
confusing ﬁction and reality here_
OPERATION WOLF - the ﬁrst person
perspective actually lets you look
into the face of your victim as he
dies. Because of its unadulterated
violence and possible political
overtones it's come in for a lot of
criticism. The question is, do you play
it for the satisfaction of seeing the
expression on the enemies' faces as
they die or just because the quick-
ﬁre action is extremely tense and
addictive?
ROBOCOP t h e  RoboCop ﬁlm-
licence ignores the conﬂict between
the will of the man and the
programming of the machine,
which makes up a large part of the

ﬁlm, and concentrates almost purely
on the movie's violent aspects. The
meanies are exclusively drug-
dealers and murderers, though, and
the setting's very much removed
from modern life,
TECHNOCOP - humdrum shoot 'em
up-cum-driving game which hod an
incredibly OTT death sequence on
the Amiga. Would this inﬂuence you
to think that it's OK to shoot ﬁrst and
ask questions later?
JACK THE RIPPER - when you think of
violent computer games, a text
adventure isn't the ﬁrst thing that
springs to mind, but because of its
accompanying graphics this one
was published with an 18 certiﬁcate.
The pictures, hardly overwhelming
on a 64, were the main reason, but
it was really the text, if anything,
which was more gruesome.
Everyone who got hold of a copy
was, of course, really and truly under
eighteen.
RED STORM RISING - Microprose are
often criticised for producing
software with politically dubious
scenarios. In this case the
background actually came from the
Tom Clancy novel of the same
name but the message on the front
of the box is clear: Save The World
From Soviet Domination.

DESERT ISLAND
DISKS:
FUNKY GIBBONS
78 ' I C
Dove Hughes discovers
the games that comic
supremo Dave Gibbons
dabbles with.
41 Dave Gibbons - Mist on the award
winning watchmen who has recently
received critical acclaim for his writing
skills.
D
recognised ﬁgure in the
ﬁckle world of graphic litera-
ture. Catapulted to comic
fame with the hugely successful
WATCHMEN series (which he
illustrated for another British marvel,
Alan Moore), Dave Gibbons began
working in comics full-time after he
gave up his job as a surveyor in
1973. At the time he WOG working
primarily for COZMIC COMICS, but he
also produced the short series
POWERMkN independently. His ﬁrst
major work came from British
weekly comic, 2000AD, for which he
has drawn such strips as HARLEM
HEROES, DAN DARE and ROGUE
TROOPER. From 2000AD he was
offered the title strip in Marvel UK's
DOCTOR WHO WEEKLY magazine.
His association with WATCHMEN
publisher DC Comics began with his
work on the GREEN LANTERN series
in 1982, but it was WATCHMEN that
won he and Alan Moore a best
writer/artist combination award. The
ﬁrst issue, published in September
1986, rook the comics world literally
by storm, experimentation in design,
style, format and the usual
superhero formula made it
compulsive reading. Set in an
alternate world very much like ours,
WATCHMEN portrayed superheroes
as outlaws t he now-infamous
Keene Act hod been passed twenty
years earlier, making all costumed
vigilantism illegal - rather than
cardboard characters in rights. It
covered issues such as rape, racism,
violence, politics, the nuclear
situation, war and sex in a mere
twelve-part-series. It is the graphic
story by which later classics hove
been judged, and rightly so.
Gibbons hod worked with Moore
once before, on a Superman story
called "For The Man Who Has
Everything", featuring Batman,

Robin, Wonder Woman, the Fortress
of Solitude and Krypton. If I had to
pick my rop two stories that I've ever
done," Gibbons declares, "that
would hove to be one of them, A
real joy oil round."
Since WATCHMEN, Gibbons has
been fairly quiet, working more as a
writer than as the artist he became
famous for and, to everyone's
annoyance (and admiration),
working equally well in both
mediums. A Gibbons-written story
recently appeared in the comics
anthology magazine Al, and he is
currently penning ROGUE TROOPER,
a story he once illustrated, for the
new-look 2000AD. He is also
working on GIVE ME LIBERTY, a snip
he is illustrating for Frank Miller, the
author of DARK KNIGHT and
ROBOCOP II scriptwriter. He
therefore doesn't have too much
time for computer games but after
consulting his "software expert" (his
ten-year-old son) he come up with
this list of titles:

My success with women is, if
anything, under-rated, but even I
would not stoop so low as to try

have neither the time, nor the
inclination, to learn limbo dancing or
build her a pair of stilts. Seriously
though, I don't know, so perhaps
other people can write in. The only
advice that I con give is that I don't
know of anyone who has ever seen
a clean shaven female dwarf.

Dear Cedric,
Please can you tell me how I con
become a barbarian when I grow
up?
Andrew CoIrone (aged 9), York
I am sorry to have to tell you this but
someone is going to have to tell
you the facts of life one day. There
ore no barbarians or dwarves or
dragons. Just as there is no such
thing as Father Christmas, the Tooty
Fairy or a winning England Cricket
team, everything in this column is
make believe written by a drunken
old hack at the whim of an even
more drunk editor.
Alternatively, eat three Shredded
Wheat for breakfast and rescue as
many princesses as possible.
Finally, just to show you that I do
occasionally know what I'm talking
about. here ore some hints and tips
for the latest Dungeons and Dragons
game from SS'. GASE of the Azure
Bonds.
Do not accept any elves into
your party. In the highly probably
event that they get killed, you
cannot resurrect them. As far as
other resurrections go, they can be
performed in camp so don't bother
wasting a cleric spell on them t r y
ﬂame strike or slay living instread,
something that will prove useful in
combat.
Make sure that you give the ring
of wizardry to one of your images, it
doubles the number of spells that
you can cast. Magic missile spells
become quite potent in the hands
of wizards and do a lot of damage
tENTIJIRES
for a ﬁrst level spell. They are
especially useful against the
assorted bits of vegetation that
attack you vegepygmies and Bits
of Moander. The wand found just
outside the pit is also useful against
these creatures and can be used by
clerics.
It is vital to hit every opposing
magic user and cleric in each
combat round - they hove the
ability to seriously damage your
health if they are allowed to cast
spells. Area spells such as ﬁreballs
work very well when you hove
room to use them but beware,
several creatures are protected
against third level spells - use ice
111 Oh no, Ws a Dracolichl
V  Attack of the killer mutant Dracoliches.
ng on a sec, that's not a Dracolichl
1
storm instead.
Cast a spell in preference to
using a wand or rod - it is generally
more potent. Save the charges on
your wands for when you have
been hit and are unable to cast a
spell.
Always pay the money to have
a magic item identiﬁed - there is
not much else to spend your ill-
gotten gold on and quite a few
objects have additional powers that
you won't discover by trial and error.
The ioun stones raise one of your
attributes by one point for as long as
you have it readied different
colours for different abilities.
In combat, it is generally much
better to gang up on one opponent
and kill him rather than wounding
two or more enemies. Dead men
don't ﬁght back
Save your position frequently
and use two separate disks, there is
at least one inﬁnite loop in the
game that made me have to start
from scratch. Take special heed if
the program warns you that the
next bit is going to be dangerous - it
will be! Beholders are not fun!
In the ﬁnal section of the game,
the curse in your ﬁnal bond means
that you will not be able to camp
and relearn your spells so don't use
them unless it is absolutely vital,
save them for the last battle.
That's all for this month. May you
never look a basilisk in the eye.

Stuart Green interviews the pillar full of hate.

one years old, and
he's not very happy.
His hair is falling lankly to the
side, he's in need of a haircut; "I'm
thinking of growing it", he explains,
"but I can't realty decide, and
anyway, I can't afford a haircut."
We'd decided to meet in my
local haunt, The Prince Albert,
Brixton. As he leans further into his
pint, Hugo tells me about the time
he shoved his hoir.
"I cut it off 'cos I was fed up with
It. I didn't wanna have any hair 'cos
everybody pissed me off, because
they were all worried about their
hairstyles. I just wasn't
shaved it off. I wasn't a skinhead, I
mean I was, but I wasn't part of their
religion. I just didn't wanna be
bothered with it, So I'm like the
same thing, only now I'm letting it
grow,"
Hugo prides himself on his
individuality, he doesn't like to be
boxed in.
"Ifs very important to me, I don't
want to be like everyone eke
because everyone else are wankers,
aren't they?
"Seriously, a lot of people are
weird I think. I don't wanna be like
those onks, it upsets me. It's not like
real life. I look at that, sometimes
look at people. and they're very
weird."
Although he's spent sometime in
the count, and living by the sea,
Hugo currently lives in a big
anonymous tower block
somewhere in the wastelands of a
sixties planning disaster. He lives on
the top ﬂoor with his friend Rufus,
worrying about his love life,
swearing at the cat, regretting it a
moment later, and storing anxiously
at the blank pieces of paper lying
on his kitchen table.
"I wanna be a writer. I wonno
write short stories I think, though I'm
nor sure. I've got a lot to sort out. The
problem is, most artists and writers
are a lot of wankers. I haven't got a
word processor. When I do write I do
everything longhand because I like
to sweat over it. These things, I hate
them, they just take the craft away
from it all."
His good friend Mick Abodzis
(that is, if Hugo can be said to have
any good friends) once nicknamed
him, 'Hugo Tate: Pillor Of Hate',
"I hove some bad dreams. I
used to have this recurring dream
about being chased by the devil.
Very important are dreams, they
can have a big effect on your

kept on having, until ﬁnally I
decided to look at the devil. And he
was me. He made me laugh. Really
laugh, and I woke up laughing.
I recognised myself. I know it's

it's simple and cliched it doesn't

many bad dreams since then,"
But he's not as bad as he seems
on the surface. He's just covering up
and not telling us the whole truth.
Hugo is a romantic who takes love
seriously. His girlfriend Mamie has just
left him to go back to her home in
California, he's missing her. and he
regrets not having the chance to soy
goodbye properly. He's really only a
misanthrope when it suits him,
"It's like I was saying before. If
people ore too obsessed with their
clothes, like my Mum was with her
business, or with their hair, then it
con screw up a lot of things. Distract
you from the important things in life,
like caring for people, the way you
talk to people, things like that. And
that's bad."
He cares about the world, and
he'd vote Green if "they hadn't
ﬂushed the world down the toilet
years ago already', but for now he's
just content to dig himself our of the
unemployed hole that he's found
himself in.
No one will make a computer
game out of Hugo Tote's life,
'Hugo Tate' by Nick Abadzis
