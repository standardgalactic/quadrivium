About the Authors
Elizabeth J. Cárdenas-Nelson: Elizabeth received a bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts from 
Cleveland State University. An avid advocate of using computers and computer programs as 
the modern artist’s brush and canvas, Elizabeth has extensive experience in design, layout, 
and illustration and has taught instructional classes on Adobe Photoshop. She also contrib-
uted to Photoshop CS2 Visual Encyclopedia (Wiley). Spending a large chunk of her Sundays 
working puzzles and unable to travel without a puzzle book in her backpack, Elizabeth is a 
devoted puzzler.
Jennifer Connolly: Jennifer has a passion for research and writing, which led to a career as 
a professional editor and author. Her family of avid puzzlers got her hooked on puzzles at an 
early age, and Jennifer continues to stash puzzle books in her car, purse, and kids’ tote bags 
so that she can work a puzzle at any given moment.
Dedication
Elizabeth: To my husband, Dave N., who supports my every endeavor.
Jennifer: To the people I love more than puzzles — David, my husband, and my two 
daughters, Hannah and Ella.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Elizabeth: I am so thankful that Lindsay Lefevere, my Acquisitions Editor at Wiley, remem-
bered me and my love of Photoshop and asked me to do this book. I appreciate that she 
partnered me with Jennifer Connolly, my co-author. Jennifer provided great captions and 
ideas for solving puzzles, and her encouragement, great sense of fun, and even nature — no 
matter how crazy or hectic the project seemed to be getting — helped make this project run 
smoothly. I also wish to thank all the people who contributed photographs, giving me an end-
less array of fun and distinct choices for puzzles in the book. Certainly I owe more than thanks 
to my husband, Dave, for making and providing many meals so that I could work without dis-
traction. Additionally, thanks to Dave, Julie Conlin, and Karen Kuhlman for testing the puzzles. 
Last, but certainly not least, thanks go to Kelly Ewing for maintaining the vision of the book 
and keeping the project on track.
Jennifer: I certainly appreciate the opportunity that Lindsay Lefevere, my Acquisitions Editor at 
Wiley, gave to me, and I can’t thank her enough for bringing me on board to write on such a fun 
topic. And many thanks goes out to my Project Editor, Kelly Ewing. She was wonderfully easy to 
work with, and she made the process effortless and painless. However, this book wouldn’t be a 
book without the huge effort of my co-author, Elizabeth Cardenas-Nelson. Elizabeth dedicated a 
great amount of time and attention to the puzzles, was so easy to work with, and from the start 
was an all-around great partner on this project. I certainly could not have done my part without 
her or without the help of David Connolly, my husband. David made sure I always had the time 
that I needed to get my writing done, and he proved to be a huge help whenever I felt “stuck.” 
Of course, my girls helped a lot, too, both by sleeping so well at night that I had enough time to 
get my writing done as well as providing comic relief whenever I needed it — sometimes, even 
when I didn’t realize that I needed it. And last, but certainly not least, I must thank my family full 
of puzzlers, especially my mom, Linda Murphy, for introducing me to the wonderful world of 
puzzling. I now always have something to do in the waiting room or the airplane or anywhere.

Introduction
P
icture puzzles make up a matchless niche in the puzzling world. Because 
each picture is unique, Picture Puzzles For Dummies offers limitless types of 
puzzles and endless arrangements that present one-of-a-kind puzzles on every 
page. Unlike traditional word or number puzzles, Picture Puzzles For Dummies 
launches you into a festive, full-color dimension of puzzling, challenging you to 
discover differences or similarities between pictures or pieces of a picture.
About This Book
Picture Puzzles For Dummies promises a great adventure, steering you 
through a variety of puzzles of varying levels of difficulty. Whether you’re 
a novice or expert puzzler, you can find plenty of puzzles in this book to 
scratch your puzzling itch.
Although you’re sure to enjoy each and every puzzle in this book, this book 
is set up so that you can move freely from one chapter or part to another. For 
example, you may dive right in to solving puzzles but then get stuck and want 
some ideas on solving picture puzzles. You can just stop what you’re doing 
and flip to Chapter 1 or the Part of Tens in the back of this book to get the 
info you need on solving. Better yet, we won’t even make you read the entire 
chapter. If you find a section or set of sections that you’re interested in, feel 
free to read just those parts, although if you want to take full advantage of all 
of the ideas on better solving practices, you may want to read it all. But we’re 
biased, of course.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make navigating this book even easier, we include some special conventions:
 
✓ Names of puzzle types: We include three different types of puzzles in 
this book, and we don’t want you to be confused about how they’re 
named. Here’s how they break down:
 
• Spot the changes: Puzzles of this type include two seemingly iden-
tical pictures with subtle changes made that you have to find.

2
Picture Puzzles For Dummies 
 
• One of these is not like the other: This puzzle type lists several 
seemingly identical pictures, but you have to spot the one that 
contains one difference from the others.
 
• Cut-ups: You can identify this puzzle because it looks like a jigsaw 
puzzle on paper.
 
✓ Number of changes: For each spot-the-changes puzzle, we identify the 
number of changes contained in the puzzle.
 
✓ Grid numbers: For spot-the-changes puzzles, a grid with numbers and 
letters surrounds the puzzles. The grid helps you solve because you can 
use it as a guide, but it also helps you identify changes in the solution.
 
✓ Cut-up grid: For each cut-up puzzle, we give you a grid as well as one 
piece filled in to get you started.
 
✓ Solutions: Each puzzle type has a unique presentation for its solution:
 
• Spot the changes: Because it can be difficult to actually recognize 
the change if you haven’t spotted it, we give you the grid number 
followed by a description of the change.
 
• One of these is not like the other: We circle the one difference to 
clearly show you the solution for this puzzle type.
 
• Cut-ups: Perhaps the easiest solution to review, the cut-up solution 
simply shows the pieced-together picture.
What You’re Not to Read
Although we like every bit of this book, you can definitely skip over some parts 
without missing anything. You may encounter gray boxes, called sidebars, 
which include interesting information about puzzling. If you want to skip over 
these sidebars, you won’t have a problem understanding how to solve picture 
puzzles or even solving the ones in this book. These boxes simply contain 
things we find interesting about picture puzzles, and while we certainly would 
be flattered if you thought so, too, we’ll never know if you skip them.
Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we had to make a few assumptions about you, and 
here’s what we thought:
 
✓ You may have no or limited experience with picture puzzles. Although 
you may enjoy puzzling, we realize that you may not be all that familiar 
with picture puzzles. So we’ve not only included puzzles at beginner 
levels, but we’ve also included plenty of information on getting started.

3
 Introduction
 
✓ You may have significant picture puzzle experience. So you’re an old 
pro, huh? Well, we have plenty of action for you, too. We have several 
levels of puzzles that can tempt even the most experienced puzzler.
 
✓ You want to know more about solving picture puzzles. Not only can 
you find chapters full of tips and ideas on solving picture puzzles, but 
also, you can put them to practice on a variety of puzzles included in 
this book.
How This Book Is Organized
We’ve put this book together in parts and chapters so that you can easily 
find information on solving puzzles, puzzles to solve, and the solutions. The 
following sections list the different parts and what those parts include so that 
you can easily navigate your way through this book.
Part I: Picking Apart Picture Puzzles
This part describes the types of picture puzzles we include in this book. It also 
offers great ideas for solving them, as well as how solving picture puzzles can 
benefit your brain.
Part II: Progressing through the Puzzles
Come to Part II to discover the fantastic, full-color world of picture puzzles. 
We include puzzles of all levels of difficulty, with plenty of variety, in this 
part. Whether you want to start out with some easy puzzles, try your hand at 
something tricky, or dive right into the more diabolical puzzles, you’re sure 
to find a puzzle that will please you in this part.
Part III: Checking Your Work — 
No Peeking!
Watch yourself now! As tempting as it may be, you don’t want to step foot 
into this part unless you’ve solved a puzzle. Trust us: You’ll be disappointed 
when you peek into this part to find out a solution that you couldn’t solve. So 
try your best to work through the puzzle first, and if you do get stuck, check 
out Chapter 1 or the Part of Tens before you seek out the solution. Save this 
part solely for checking the puzzles you’ve solved.

Picture Puzzles For Dummies 
Part IV: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens includes two chapters created in a top ten–list format. In 
this part, you can find tips on solving picture puzzles, as well as ideas on how 
to train your brain to solve puzzles better and quicker.
Icons Used in This Book
To make picking out information from the book even easier, we include some 
icons to flag specific information.
 
The Tip icon lets you know when you’re about to read information that can 
make you a smarter and savvier solver.
 
Just as this icon indicates, you don’t want to forget any information that this 
icon flags.
 
Look out! When you come across this icon, it warns you against doing things 
that may be detrimental!
Where to Go from Here
You want to dive right in, but are you ready for the deep end of diabolical 
puzzles, or do you need to wade through the kiddie pool of easy puzzles first? 
Well, that depends on how confident you are at solving picture puzzles. If you 
think you’ve got picture puzzles pretty much licked, step on up to the tricky 
or tough puzzles and give ’em a try. If they’re too difficult, step it down a 
notch, but if you breeze right through them, take it up to the next level. Now 
if you’re confident that you’re a beginner, head on over to the easy puzzles, 
and work your way through a few. When you feel confident that you can 
easily cut through them, try the next level, and so on, until you come across 
a real challenge.
If you’re brand new to picture puzzles, head directly to Chapter 1 and find 
out more about the puzzles as well as strategies to solve them. In fact, you 
may even benefit from reading the Part of Tens as well to give your solving 
skills some extra oomph. Just remember, it doesn’t matter where you begin 
because you can always move back and forth as you quickly solve puzzles or 
face real challenges.

Part I
Picking Apart 
Picture Puzzles

In this part . . .
T
his part introduces you to the world of picture puzzles 
and helps you get started. In Chapter 1, you can discover 
the different types of picture puzzles contained in this book 
as well as understand how they function. Chapter 1 also 
provides you with several options for solving picture puzzles 
and tells you how puzzling can boost your brain power.

Chapter 1
Getting Set to Solve 
Picture Puzzles
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out the puzzle types
▶ Solving puzzles with specific strategies
▶ Engaging your brain with picture puzzles
W
hether you’ve just become interested in pictures puzzles or you’ve 
tried some already and need tips on solving them, you can find all the 
information you need in this chapter. No matter what section you read in this 
chapter — whether you get familiar with puzzle types, solving strategies, or 
ways to boost your brain — each section gives you some info that can make 
you stronger at solving the picture puzzles in this book.
In this chapter, we explain how all the puzzle types differ and how breaking 
them down actually helps get you started on solving them. The more that 
you’re familiar with the type of puzzle you’re solving, the better you’ll be 
at solving it. Of course, you probably want to try the solving strategies we 
describe in this chapter as well. We give you the best strategies that you can 
use to solve all types of picture puzzles. We even give you ideas on how to 
boost your brainpower to take your solving skills to the next level.
Getting a Feel for the Picture Puzzle Types
In the wide world of picture puzzles, you run across more than just one type 
to solve. Each type provides you with a different challenge, and before you 
dive into solving any puzzle, getting the lay of the land helps you become 
familiar with how the puzzle works. In the following sections, we describe the 
three types of puzzles you can solve in this book.

8
Part I: Picking Apart Picture Puzzles 
Checking out changes
Spot-the-changes puzzles tend to be the type of picture puzzle most people rec-
ognize. In a spot-the-changes puzzle, you’re given two pictures that look identical 
at first glance. However, one of the pictures contains some differences — for 
example, the flower pot in one picture may be blue but green in the other pic-
ture’. Although glancing through the puzzle can be an effective strategy while 
solving, you also need to look closely to pick out all the changes. (See the section 
later in this chapter, “Solving All Types of Picture Puzzles,” for more on solving 
spot-the-changes puzzles.)
In this book, we let you know how many changes you should be spotting, 
plus we give you checkboxes so that you can keep track of how many you 
uncover. (See Chapter 2 for more on how it helps to keep track of your work.) 
In each puzzle, one of the pictures also has numbers across the top and let-
ters down the side so that you can work the puzzle like a grid, going from 
section A1 to A2, and so on.
Knowing which one is not like the other
Similar to spot-the-changes puzzles, a one-of-these-is-not-like-the-other 
puzzle — or a Not puzzle — contains several pictures that all seem to be 
the same. But unlike the spot-the-changes puzzle, a Not puzzle contains 
six pictures, only one of which is slightly different! You have to scour each 
picture to figure out which one contains a subtle change.
 
Most people think that Not puzzles must be more difficult than spot-the-changes 
puzzles, but depending on how easily you can spot a change, a Not puzzle may 
actually be easier because you’re looking for just one change. For some people, 
finding just one change becomes more of a challenge.
Working a jigsaw puzzle . . . on paper
Regardless of whether you like jigsaw puzzles, you should try cut-up puzzles. 
Cut-up puzzles consist of two grids: One grid displays a picture divided into 
numbered pieces, which are scrambled, and the other grid is blank except 
for one piece, which is correctly placed as a hint to help get you started. You 
have to figure out where to place each of the other numbered pieces within 
the grid to make a complete picture.

9
 Chapter 1: Getting Set to Solve Picture Puzzles
 
Sketch or write the numbers of each piece in the empty grid. Sketching can 
help you as you solve, and writing in the numbers helps keep track of your 
work. (See the section later in this chapter, “Piecing the picture together,” for 
more on solving cut-up puzzles. See Chapter 2 for more on how keeping track 
of your work helps you solve the puzzle.)
Serving Up Solving Strategies
You can use several different strategies for solving picture puzzles, and we 
encourage you to try them all to see which ones work well for you. Not all 
strategies are puzzle-specific. What works for a spot-the-changes puzzle may 
also work for a cut-up puzzle. Which ones you decide to use depends largely 
on which strategies you feel most comfortable with.
 
Create a solving routine by using a pattern to go over the puzzle or by combin-
ing several solving techniques. (See the section “Move through the puzzle in 
a pattern,” later in this chapter, for more on using patterns.) Using a solving 
routine ensures that you exhaust every technique that works for you and that 
you scour every nook and cranny of the puzzle while you’re solving. For more 
on solving routines, see Chapter 2. Just remember: You won’t find an exact 
step-by-step routine in this book because whatever solving routine works for 
you may not work for someone else. So try all the techniques to find out which 
routines result in solving success for you.
You can use any of the strategies listed in the following sections for any 
puzzle type in this book. However, we break the puzzle-solving strategies 
down by puzzle type in the following sections. By searching the solving 
strategies by puzzle type, you can see which strategies work best for each 
type. Then it’s up to you to overlap strategies and experiment with any of 
them to find the best solving routine for you.
Spotting the differences
In spot-the-changes puzzles, your job is to, well, spot the changes. Sounds 
easy enough until you find all of them except two, which results in chaos. Why 
chaos? First, you discover that you can’t put the book down until you find the 
two changes that you’re missing. Then, supper begins burning in the oven 
and boiling over on the stove. Your boss calls you about work, and you can’t 
take your mind off of the puzzle to answer the phone. Your kids need a bath 
because they’ve been playing in the mud while you’ve been trying to solve a 
picture puzzle. The FedEx guy keeps ringing your doorbell to have you sign for 
a package, but you don’t answer. You want to call out for help from your part-
ner, but you can’t do anything until you find those two changes! Chaos.

10
Part I: Picking Apart Picture Puzzles 
But if you have a plan — a strategy — before you begin, your searching can 
easily result in success, and you can avoid the chaos and calamity that fruit-
less searching brings. Just try using the ideas listed in the following sections 
to find all the differences in spot-the-changes puzzles.
Look for the obvious
You may think that we’ve given you an obvious idea. However, in your anxiety 
to find changes, you may skip over some obvious differences. Follow these two 
basic strategies to make sure that you don’t miss a thing:
 
✓ Glance through the puzzle. Sounds a bit casual, we know. But when 
you first begin the puzzle, you can often glance through it and find some 
pretty obvious differences. A teeny tiny moon that becomes twice its 
size in the second picture can be pretty obvious, even at a glance.
 
 Although this technique is most effective when beginning a puzzle, it 
sure does help when you’re stuck, too. Often, when you’re stuck, just 
glancing through the puzzle may help you spot a section, detail, or 
change that you glossed over earlier.
 
✓ Distinguish the details. When solving a picture puzzle, a flower isn’t a 
flower. A flower may be a long-stemmed red rose. A tree isn’t just a tree. 
A tree may be a short white birch. If you look at a puzzle and think, 
“There’s a fence,” instead of, “There’s a wire fence with three posts,” 
you may miss that one of the fence posts has been shortened or is 
altogether missing.
Move through the puzzle in a pattern
When you use a pattern to search through a puzzle, you discipline yourself to 
scan the puzzle systematically. Using a systematic approach, you can be sure 
of the following:
 
✓ You search each space. A pattern helps you search through each grid 
space (such as, A1, B1, and so on) with the comfort of knowing you’re 
tackling each piece of the puzzle and not glossing over anything.
 
✓ You search each space thoroughly. When you search through the 
puzzle in a pattern, you have a better chance of leaving no stone 
unturned. By breaking the puzzle up into smaller pieces, you have an 
easier time looking for minute details
 
✓ You search each space thoroughly while also looking for the obvious. 
When you use patterns in conjunction with techniques for finding obvious 
changes (see the earlier section, “Look for the obvious,” for more about 
searching for the obvious), you tackle both the obvious changes and details 
in a systematic approach. Although you may glance over the puzzle and 
then tackle it using a pattern, you still need to distinguish the details and be 
on the lookout for obvious things you may have missed earlier.

11
 Chapter 1: Getting Set to Solve Picture Puzzles
Using a pattern with spot-the-changes puzzles is easy. You study each grid 
space, comparing it to the other picture’s same grid space, and you really 
have two options:
 
✓ Scan from top to bottom. Because you have a grid to work with, you 
begin with A1, then B1, then C1, and so on until you get to the bottom of 
the puzzle. Then you go back to the top and scour A2, then B2, and so on.
 
✓ Look from left to right. Using the grid, you work through the puzzle like 
reading — left to right. Start with A1, then A2, then A3 and so on until you 
reach the end of the row. Then you begin with B1, then B2, and so on.
Eyeing the oddball
The one-of-these-is-not-like-the-other puzzles — or Not puzzles — don’t 
have grids or other helpers to get you started. You have your peepers and 
a pencil, perhaps, but that’s about it. Such a predicament may scare some 
people away, but oddly enough, although Not puzzles can pose a challenge, 
even beginners can solve them.
For some people, having several pictures to compare poses an easier mental 
challenge than just having two pictures to compare. Of course, more pictures 
also means more chances that you may miss something. But in the sections 
that follow, we provide you with some great ideas on solving Not puzzles so 
that you don’t overlook any details.
Keep comparisons focused with a pattern
Using a pattern — a systematic approach — helps you move through the 
puzzle without missing any details. Not puzzles don’t have grids like spot-
the-changes puzzles, so you can’t use the grid to break down each picture 
for comparison. However, you can make your own breakdown and still use 
a pattern. Use these ideas to get you thinking about how you can establish a 
pattern for solving different Not puzzles:
 
✓ If people are in the picture: Compare each person from head to toe. 
You won’t get very far if you compare the eyes in one picture to the eyes 
in another and then skip to comparing the color of the stripes in that 
person’s shirt. Even if you think the detail is the same in all the pictures, 
still check. After you’re sure that you’ve compared where a person’s 
hair is parted, move on to the color of the hair, and then on to the color 
of the eyes, and so on.
 
✓ If several objects are in the picture: Pick specific objects to compare 
in each picture. The easiest way to compare objects is to move through 
the photo from left to right, top to bottom.

12
Part I: Picking Apart Picture Puzzles 
 
✓ If just one main object is in the picture: You may feel overwhelmed to 
see just a single object in a Not puzzle, but just take a deep breath and 
start at the beginning with the details, literally. Every object, no matter 
how simple it looks at first, contains multiple elements. For example, if 
the image is a staircase, compare the details from the top of the stair-
case to the bottom. Or begin with railing, move on to the steps, and so 
on. If the image doesn’t have an obvious beginning or end (like a wheel 
or flower), try comparing specific details, such as color, size of things 
within the image, and so on, moving in a patterned fashion over the 
image, such as right to left, top to bottom.
Pick out differences in the details
Although you may get lucky and see an obvious difference right at the start, 
chances are you have to pick through the details to find the one change 
amongst all of the pictures. But with six pictures to go through, whether you 
use a pattern or not, you can go a little crazy comparing them all. So use the 
following ideas to help make sifting through the details less painful:
 
✓ Use one picture as a “base.” Use the first picture in the Not puzzle as 
your base — the picture you compare all other pictures against. Use a 
pattern, and then compare the details of the base picture against each of 
the other pictures. (See the earlier section, “Keep comparisons focused 
with a pattern,” for more on patterns. )
 
✓ Compare details individually. You may think that you’ve noticed a 
particular detail, such as the color of a person’s eyes, while comparing 
another detail, but don’t fool yourself. You need to look and compare 
each detail individually; don’t dismiss any detail if you haven’t purpose-
fully searched for it and compared it to all the pictures.
Piecing the picture together
Think of cut-up puzzles like a jigsaw puzzle — you have to piece it together 
with just your eyes . . . unless, of course, you cut the picture out of the book 
and piece it together on the table, but what’s the fun in that? Of course, with 
no corner pieces let alone a box lid to start with, you may be wondering how 
you’re supposed to begin — let alone solve — this kind of puzzle. Well, we start 
you off with one piece correctly placed, but the rest is up to you. So check out 
the following sections to get some ideas on how to finish solving a Not puzzle.
Get a quick take on what the picture is
First, try giving the pieces a quick scan and see whether you can figure out 
what the picture is. Is it a flower? Is it a beach scene? Is it a garden? You get 
the idea.

13
 Chapter 1: Getting Set to Solve Picture Puzzles
However, you may have a difficult time figuring out what in the world you’ve 
been staring at for the past ten minutes. If you find yourself in that predica-
ment, try figuring out what the picture is composed of. Does it look like it has 
a clump of trees? Can you see the makings of a dirt road?
After you begin to discover what parts make up the entire picture, you can 
get a better idea on what the picture is as a whole. And after you know what 
you’re looking at, you can begin putting the pieces together.
 
Especially with some of the more difficult puzzles, you may never figure out 
what the entire picture is, and that’s okay. Even if you’re truly stumped, if you 
can find just one obvious part, you can begin to piece the picture together.
Plug in the obvious parts
Use the process of elimination to piece together obvious parts, leaving the 
other — often more difficult — pieces for last. For example, if you find the side 
of a building, try plugging all the pieces together to complete the side of the 
building and then see what pieces you have leftover. You’ll be amazed at how 
quickly some of the more difficult details fall into place. If you’re still stuck 
on some difficult details, check out the following section, “Leave the difficult 
details for last.”
 
Even if you don’t know exactly where in the grid you should place the obvious 
parts, still piece it together — in your head, at least. By eliminating the pieces 
that make up the obvious part you’ve discovered, you may have an easier 
time both figuring out where in the grid to place part, as well as where to plug 
in the finishing details.
Leave the difficult details for last
After you’ve plugged in some obvious parts, even just a couple of details can 
still stump you, but you can still solve the cut-up puzzle if you try the follow-
ing ideas:
 
✓ Look for similarities. After you put together some obvious parts, look 
for similarities in those parts that can connect them to your leftover 
pieces. Check to see whether your leftover pieces share a similar color, 
background, or setting.
 
✓ Compare empty spots and their borders in the grid. Find empty spots 
on the grid and then check out what borders those empty spaces. Check 
to see whether any lines, colors, or forms on the borders of empty 
spaces can possibly connect to one of your leftover pieces.
 
✓ Sketch your heart out. Although you may not be an award-winning 
artist, you can probably connect some lines or dots. So remember: You 
don’t have to replicate a piece perfectly to figure out where it fits. If you 
can’t figure out by eye what empty spots the leftover pieces can fit into, 
try sketching it out a bit.

Pumping Mental Iron 
with Picture Puzzles
Just by carrying this book around, you may find yourself being asked to help 
solve a neighbor’s crossword puzzle or a friend’s brainteaser. Because it takes 
a detail-oriented individual with impeccable focus to solve picture puzzles, 
people just assume that you’ve got those skills if they catch you fiddling with 
picture puzzles.
Regardless where you fall on the mental fitness meter, you not only can solve 
picture puzzles, but you can also boost your brain power at the same time. 
Anyone can do pictures puzzles, and everyone can benefit from solving them. 
Think of solving picture puzzles as a way to maintain as well as increase your 
mental activity.
The following sections show you how you can get a brain boost from solving 
picture puzzles, and you can also discover how to take your solving skills to 
the next level.
Breaking a sweat with your brain
If you don’t think you fit the big-brain category — despite what your friends 
and family believe — start solving picture puzzles and see what differences you 
discover in your mind, attention, and stress level. In case you can’t wait to find 
out, here’s how solving picture puzzles can benefit your brain and body:
 
✓ Muscling up your mind: Simply put, use it or lose it! Stop staring at the 
back of headrests on airplanes and work a picture puzzle instead. Take 
this book with you to your porch and give your mind a mental workout 
rather than veg out watching the flowers grow.
 
 Using your mind helps retain mental acuity — the stuff you want when 
you’re older so that you can remember that your keys are on the hook 
and your glasses aren’t misplaced, they’re just on your head. Even just a 
few picture puzzles a day can help you keep your wits about you.
 
✓ Training your attention: You may think, or have been told by your mother, 
your teacher, or your spouse, that you don’t pay attention. Perhaps that’s 
keeping you from trying picture puzzles, but that complaint should be the 
reason you work them! Working picture puzzles helps to increase your 
attention span because you have to remain focused.

15
 Chapter 1: Getting Set to Solve Picture Puzzles
 
 Solving a picture puzzle, no matter what type, requires strong focus. 
You have to be able to block out distractions and keep track of what 
you’ve done all while life’s distractions attempt to interrupt your focus. 
Of course, as you learn to be better focused, it may result in your being 
able to block out your mother, teacher, or spouse more effectively, too. 
You have to decide whether that’s an added bonus or not.
 
✓ Reducing tension: Just like working out your body can relieve stress, 
working out your mind can have the same result. Solving some picture 
puzzles gives you a feeling of success and helps you see the problems 
that are stressing you from a different perspective.
 
 Working puzzles give you a simple break as well. Even if you don’t solve 
a puzzle completely, just immersing yourself in something different gives 
you a break from dwelling on a stressful situation.
Taking it to the next level
Perhaps you understand that picture puzzles give your brain a workout for 
the better (if you don’t understand that, you should check out the earlier sec-
tion, “Breaking a sweat with your brain”), but you want to boost your solving 
as well as brain building efforts. You can uncover some ways to take your 
skills to the next level:
 
✓ Keep your brain challenged. If you keep your brain challenged, you 
can better solve puzzles, boost your brainpower, and solve even bigger 
puzzles. But you have to know when you need to be challenged. Your 
first clue should be when you breeze through a certain level of picture 
puzzles. When you burn through solving several puzzles at one sitting, 
you need to turn up the heat rather than revel in how bright you are.
 
 To keep your brain challenged:
 
• Try a different type of picture puzzle.
 
• Move on to a higher level of difficulty.
 
• Switch gears to a brain teaser, crossword, or other type of puzzle.
 
✓ Turn off the tube. Just like your mother told you, television rots your 
brain. Okay, maybe TV isn’t really that bad, but it certainly doesn’t help 
you take your solving skills to the next level. Television increases the 
chance that you’ll eat more and exercise less. And if that wasn’t enough, 
all those commercials are enough to convince you that you don’t have 
it all but that you do need it all, which is enough to stress you out (and 
then make you eat more, exercise less, you get the picture). So do your-
self a favor and turn your brain on by turning your TV off!

16
Part I: Picking Apart Picture Puzzles 
 
✓ Work out your body to boost brain power. Although we don’t plan on 
putting you on a strict exercise regimen to increase your ability to solve 
picture puzzles, we do want to point out that physical activity results 
in a positive push for brain power. While we’d love to have you sit and 
work every puzzle in this book (and we hope you do solve every puzzle), 
you do have to get up and get moving each day. Physical exercise pro-
tects the brain and gets your blood flowing and pumping to your brain.
 
 Go for a walk or give or whatever physical activity you enjoy a try. You 
can build a better memory and increase your problem-solving skills in 
the process. And those problem-solving skills come in handy for solving 
picture puzzles!
Use your brain before you buy
Amidst parental complaints that electronic 
devices, such as computers and video games, 
are wasting their kids’ time, the industry has 
answered by touting new — and often expen-
sive — alternatives. Okay, perhaps we’re using 
the word “alternatives” loosely. Basically, the 
“new alternatives” consist of the exact same 
products they were selling before: computer 
and video games, except these games are sup-
posed to help increase brainpower. In fact, you 
can find ads all over the place that claim their 
new-fangled electronic games are the best way 
to build your brain. Of course, you have to turn 
over more than a few bucks to build your brain 
with these new toys.

Part IV
The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
N
o For Dummies book would be complete without 
a Part of Tens. In this part, you can find two fun 
chapters created in a top ten–list format. We’ve kept them 
short and sweet, giving you the skinny on the best tips for 
solving picture puzzles as well as ideas on how to amp up 
your brain power to solve puzzles better and quicker.

Chapter 2
Ten Tips for Solving
In This Chapter
▶ Putting a plan together and mapping out a routine
▶ Blocking distractions to focus on details
▶ Giving everything (but quitting) a try
A
w, come on — don’t be embarrassed that you flipped to this chapter! 
Wanna know a secret? No matter how adept a puzzler, most puzzlers 
can’t resist the temptation to flip to the tips chapter. Who wouldn’t want an 
edge? Whether you’re stumped, stuck at a certain level, or simply want to 
increase how quickly you solve picture puzzles, you can find some great ideas 
to improve your game — regardless of what kind of puzzle you’re solving— in 
this chapter.
Getting Organized
Don’t worry. When we tell you to get organized, we’re not wanting you to 
start cleaning out closets and filling every available plastic tub with whatever 
odds and ends that you find. Of course, if doing so helps you solve puzzles, 
be our guest! On the other hand, to get geared up to solve a picture puzzle, 
clear the clutter from your mind, not your closet, and get yourself organized 
before you dive in. Being organized — whether you simply stick to a specific 
solving routine (which we recommend in the next section) or sit in your 
lucky chair with your lucky pencil and lucky cup of coffee — means getting 
yourself to a place where you can relax and focus on solving the puzzle.
 
You can find a rare breed of folks walking around who can simply flip open a 
puzzle book and begin solving puzzles with no organization, but if you want to 
feel the calm serenity that solving puzzles can bring, just get organized!

176
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Establishing a Solving Routine
Routine is a good thing. Now say that over and over again in your head until 
the idea becomes, well, routine. Having a solving routine not only gives you 
a pattern to follow so that you don’t miss any details, but it also builds your 
confidence as you begin to solve puzzles smarter and faster.
Some people get pretty detailed with their routine. They know exactly what 
time, where, and under what conditions they’ll sit down and work a puzzle. 
If you want to add those kinds of parameters to your solving routine, that’s 
fine, but you need to focus on establishing a routine for actually solving the 
puzzle itself. Nothing will frustrate you and your brain more than hopping all 
over a picture looking for changes or skipping from one fragment of a cut-up 
puzzle to another trying to randomly see whether something clicks.
Instead, decide — before you sit down to solve — exactly how you plan on 
solving the puzzle. For example, if you’re tackling a spot-the-changes puzzle, 
try going from left to right, starting at the top and working your way to the 
bottom. Or try working it by sections in an orderly fashion (A1, A2, and so 
on, or A1, B1, and so on). Then again, you may find that a couple of a dif-
ferent strategies put together work best for you, such as, glancing through 
the puzzle quickly for obvious things and then setting off on a strict pattern 
search. Regardless of what you choose, find a routine you can stick to, which 
will ensure that you don’t miss a thing while solving. (Check out Chapter 1 
for concrete ideas on routines and patterns for solving puzzles.)
 
Make keeping track of your progress (see the next section) part of your 
routine so that you don’t go back over parts of the puzzle that you’ve already 
checked. Not only is redoing what you’ve already checked a time waster, it’s 
also frustrating.
Keeping Track of What You’ve Done
Guess what? You can write in this book! As a matter of fact, keeping track of 
what you’ve done helps you avoid going back to that spot again. Plus, keep-
ing track of everything in your head is hard, especially when you’re checking 
the answers. So track your progress and make it part of your solving routine.
But what do you mark exactly? Well, that depends on the type of puzzle:
 
✓ Spot-the-changes puzzle: Feel free to circle changes or jot down the 
change and section in the margin (for example, hat changed from blue 
to purple in C5). Also, mark out spots you keep going back to where you 
know for sure there aren’t any changes.

177
 Chapter 2: Ten Tips for Solving
 
✓ One-of-these-is-not-like-the-other puzzle: Unlike spot-the-changes puzzles, 
you’re looking for just one difference in just one picture. So as you find ele-
ments that match in all of the pictures, put an X over them so that you don’t 
drift back to those elements. For example, after you conclude that the single 
flower in the vase is the same color in all of the pictures, mark it. (Just be 
sure that all parts of that flower match . . . not just the petals!) Mark the 
similarities that all pictures share in just one picture rather than in all of 
them. Use that one picture as your checklist of all the places you’ve looked.
 
✓ Cut-up puzzle: You may find it helpful to roughly sketch next to certain 
pieces (you don’t have to be an artist to do this) to make sure certain 
parts do match up. Then as you figure out which piece goes where, put 
a checkmark above the piece so that you know you’ve used it. You don’t 
want to put a mark through the piece because you still need to look at it 
to figure out what other pieces connect to it.
 
Always use pencil. You won’t be happy if you make a mistake in ink and cover 
up a piece of the puzzle you need to be looking at!
Limiting Distractions
Sounds obvious, we know . . . but if you find yourself having trouble staying 
focused on the puzzle, you may be swamped with too many distractions. Of 
course, life is full of distractions, but you can limit those distractions without 
making your partner put the TV on mute all night.
Cutting down on distractions is simply a matter of timing. Know at what times 
you solve puzzles the best and encounter the least amount of distractions. For 
example, when you’re hosting a play date, you have your plate full of distrac-
tions. On the other hand, when the sugar high has worn off and the kids take a 
nap, you have the perfect, distraction-free chunk of time for solving puzzles.
 
Life’s interruptions can have you wondering, “Where was I?” when you’re 
solving a puzzle, but if you have a routine (see “Establishing a Solving 
Routine,” earlier in this chapter), you can confidently find where you left off 
even if you do lose focus.
Scanning the Forest . . .
Taking a glance at the big picture works well when you use it as an initial strat-
egy in your solving routine as well as when you need a break from detailed 
solving. Often, regardless of how great your solving routine is, and no matter if 

178
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
you’ve already scanned the entire picture earlier in your routine, you might need 
to switch strategies. (If you’re wondering what in the world a solving routine is, 
see the section, “Establishing a Solving Routine,” earlier in this chapter.)
So before you begin and whenever you feel stuck, take note of where you’ve 
left off, take a step back, and just check over the big picture. After you’ve 
been solving for details, you’ll be amazed at how taking a step back can 
garner great results. When you become so familiar with details in a puzzle, 
foraging at the forest level can make differences (or similarities, if you’re 
trying to piece a picture together) more obvious than if you continue poking 
through the plants.
. . . Scouring the Trees
Perhaps you have a solid solving routine (if not, see “Establishing a Solving 
Routine,” earlier in this chapter), but you don’t think you’re getting down 
to the nitty-gritty details. Trust us, you can easily get lost in the details of a 
puzzle no matter how brilliant a solving routine you use. Really, truly seeing 
the trees rather than the forest involves purposefully moving through spe-
cific details within your routine.
You can purposefully move from detail to detail by repeating — in your mind 
or out loud — the specifics of the detail. So rather than seeing a sock on some-
one’s foot, say to yourself, “There’s a pink, knee-high sock.” If you’re solving a 
spot-the-changes or one-of-these-is-not-like-the-other puzzle, glance over at the 
other picture/s, while repeating the details and check whether that same sock 
is pink, or if it’s shorter or longer. If you’re piecing a picture together, look for 
more leg or a matching sock in a different piece. No matter what strategy or 
solving routine you have, pointing out the specific details of each piece of each 
puzzle helps you completely check through each part of the puzzle.
Trying a New Strategy
If you find yourself flipping out or frustrated because you’re so close to solv-
ing a puzzle but can’t quite get it done, you need to try a new strategy. Gasp! 
A new strategy? But haven’t we been praising the usefulness of a solving 
routine? Well, yes, but sometimes you complete your routine, and you’re still 
close to solving the puzzle, but not quite done. Then what do you do?
You could start your routine all over again, but that approach may sound 
tedious when you’re so close to being done. If you have your wits about you 
and the stamina to go through your entire routine again, then, by all means, 
do it. But if you’re looking for a quick fix, try something new. Something new 

179
 Chapter 2: Ten Tips for Solving
doesn’t necessarily mean a strategy you’ve never used. You can just pull out 
a strategy you use at the beginning or in the middle of your routine, such as 
sitting back and glancing at the big picture or simply taking a break. So if you 
need an edge, take a deep breath and try a strategy you haven’t used lately.
 
If you try out a new strategy, don’t quit halfway through. Stick it out. For 
example, if you decide to look at all the details of the tree trunks in a picture, 
don’t stop if you haven’t come up with anything after checking through just 
half of the tree trunks. After you do a few puzzles, you’ll find one or two new 
strategies that you most often like to pull out of your back pocket when you 
need a fresh look.
Taking a Break . . . But Don’t Quit!
Everybody needs a break sometime, so don’t feel guilty about taking one 
no matter how close you are to getting the puzzle solved. We all take them! 
Especially if you think you’re about to give up and just check the answers instead 
of completely solving the puzzle, please get up and take a break. Checking the 
answers prematurely can make you become more frustrated — especially when 
you kick yourself for how easy the answer seems — and there’s simply no fun in 
quitting anyway.
So, when you need a break, take any kind of break you want to. Perhaps you 
just get up and make a fresh pot of coffee, and that activity gives you enough 
time away from the puzzle to sit back down and give it a fresh look. On the other 
hand, you may need to take a walk around the block, take a nap, or just put that 
puzzle down until tomorrow. Regardless of what you decide to do, when you’re 
up against a wall, don’t quit — instead, just give your mind a break.
Wrangling out of a Rut
You can find yourself spinning your wheels at the beginning of solving, in the 
middle, or near the end . . . basically, you can get stuck in a rut anytime. Well, 
don’t fret because the following list gives you several things you can do — 
many of which we discuss in this chapter — to get yourself out of a solving rut:
 
✓ Use a routine. If you establish a routine for solving, you can build in 
several strategies to keep yourself moving instead of doing the same 
thing over and over again. (See “Establishing a Solving Routine,” earlier 
in this chapter.)
 
✓ Assess whether you’re focused. If you’re allowing a lot of things to 
distract you, you need to get rid of them. (See the section earlier in this 
chapter, “Limiting Distractions.”)

180
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Check to see whether you simply need a break. Especially if you’ve 
been solving for a while, you may just need a break. If so, take one. (See 
the section earlier, “Take a Break . . . But Don’t Quit.”)
 
✓ Pull out a new strategy. If you’re scouring the puzzle using the same 
strategy over and over again, try something new. Even if you use a 
strategy that you used earlier in solving, it can feel new and result in 
a fresh outlook. (See the earlier section, “Trying a New Strategy” for 
more information.)
Noticing the Unnoticeable
An unnoticeable element refers to that one last piece or change that stands 
between you and solving the puzzle. Different from spinning your wheels in 
a rut or hitting a wall, the unnoticeable element simply eludes you regardless 
of what strategy you use. So wait! You need to first determine whether you’re 
simply in a rut. So try out the tips in “Wrangling out of a Rut,” earlier in this 
chapter, before you move on in this section.
If you’re not just in a rut, you’re likely missing a detail in a detail. If you’re 
sure that you’ve checked all the elements, begin with checking out elements 
you’ve already marked off your list. (See “Keeping Track of What You’ve 
Done,” earlier in this chapter.) Make sure that you didn’t overlook a detail 
with that element. For example, you know you checked where the tree is 
placed and how tall it is, but did you check whether the trunk is shorter or 
longer or whether the branches extend as far as you thought they did?

Chapter 3
Ten Ways to Build Your Brain 
for Better Solving
In This Chapter
▶ Sharpening your focus and attention
▶ Using different activities to raise your solving quotient
▶ Keeping your body in good working order
A
lthough you can get specific tips on solving picture puzzles (see 
Chapter 2), we give you the biggest solving tip right here: Work out 
that big muscle in your head. Maintaining focus or approaching puzzles in a 
new way exercises that gray matter. And in this chapter, we give you several 
activities and challenges that can shift your brain into a higher gear, ready 
and waiting to solve picture puzzles.
Keeping Your Focus
Of course, solving a puzzle in a nice, quiet space, devoid of all interruption, 
may be your ideal, but sometimes it’s not exactly realistic. You have a life 
going on around you, such as children needing attention, the phone ringing, 
the dryer buzzer going off, or horns honking . . . wait a minute . . . you’re not 
driving, are you? While keeping your focus can be a challenge, it can increase 
your puzzle-solving skills.
Making sure you stay focused in spite of interruptions takes a little preparation 
and practice. You know what kinds of interruptions you’ll encounter, so prepare 
for them and practice paying no attention to those things until you’ve found a 
good stopping point. For example, if you know you’re going to work a puzzle 
while waiting in the doctor’s office, you don’t want to look up every time the 
door opens, a name is called, or someone coughs and sneezes. So prepare for 
those interruptions. Don’t worry — you won’t miss your name being called. By 
the time they yell your name for the third time, you’ll hear them.

182
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
By the same token, if you’re at home while the kids are playing and the laun-
dry is in the dryer, either use those interruptions for natural boundaries or 
build your own boundaries. Use the dryer buzzing or the kids’ snack time as 
your signal to take a break. (Taking a break is a good thing sometimes — see 
the section, “Taking a Break . . . But Don’t Quit!” later in this chapter.) If you 
know you’re bound to be interrupted, prepare yourself to keep focused on 
the puzzle until you can note where you’ve stopped. Of course, if the kids are 
bleeding or suffering from broken bones, feel free to drop everything at once 
and frantically run about the house until they’re mended.
Finding the Right Spot to Settle In
Ah, the comfy chair, the quiet patio, the serene library . . . you figure one 
of these spots should be perfect for puzzling, right? Then your chair won’t 
recline just right, a flock of geese constantly flies over your patio, and the 
library has just been overrun by a group of school children. By this point, 
you may be wondering whether the “right spot” actually exists.
Lucky for you, defining your perfect spot for puzzling doesn’t require an 
advanced degree. First, determine what kind of environment you need. Do 
you like the low murmur of a TV or radio in the background? Do you prefer 
absolute quiet, which may be impossible to find short of locking yourself in 
the bathroom? After you understand the kind of environment that suits your 
puzzling personality the best, just get out there and find it.
 
If nothing else, be flexible. You can have more than one spot. For example, if 
your comfy chair happens to be in the family room, and you sit down for a 
picture puzzle marathon at the same time that your partner wants to watch 
the big game, you need to change your spot. Have a backup spot . . . or two!
Engaging Your Attention
Of course, picture puzzles have plenty to tickle your attention, but you can 
improve your solving skills and technique by engaging your mind in other 
ways. Solving picture puzzles relies on keen concentration, and you can 
sharpen your mind simply by exercising it.
Find enjoyable activities that force you to concentrate, especially for long 
periods of time — even better with distractions you have to block out. Maybe 
you get into bird-watching and enjoy sitting still for that one moment when 

183
 Chapter 3: Ten Ways to Build Your Brain for Better Solving
you see or hear a bird and seek it out, studying the bird’s characteristics. 
On the other hand, you may be a game player who enjoys chess or bingo. 
Both of those games demand attention in different ways, and bingo has the 
bonus of having plenty of distractions. Any way you look at it, you can find 
an activity that appeals to you — from video games to painting — that can 
put your attention to the test for long periods of time.
Trying a Variety of Other Puzzles
We do allow you to cheat on this picture puzzle book with other puzzles. In 
fact, we encourage it! Pick up Sudoku For Dummies, Crossword Puzzles For 
Dummies, or Brain Games For Dummies (all published by Wiley) and try them 
out. Doing different puzzles gets your brain thinking in different ways, which 
can give you an edge as you solve picture puzzles.
Ever ask someone for an opinion, hoping that this person sees your issue 
from an angle you haven’t thought of before? Well, getting your brain think-
ing in ways it hasn’t before in regards to puzzles can give you the different 
angle you need to approach solving picture puzzles in a novel way. Perhaps 
you have trouble getting into a solving routine or sticking to one. Doing some 
Sudoku puzzles can definitely solidify the benefits of using a solving routine. 
So do some different puzzles — even if it’s just the daily crossword — and 
you may find yourself approaching your next picture puzzle in a new way.
Taking a Break from Mind-Numbing 
Activities
To keep your brain in top-notch shape, skip or at least limit the habits that tend 
to make you veg out. Just as keeping your attention engaged in an activity or 
different puzzle can boost your brain power, vegging out over the latest movie 
rental or that season marathon of a reality show that you’ve seen a million times 
makes your brain go into a lull. Plus, television can actually shorten your atten-
tion span, whether you skip through the commercials or not.
But you can find other activities that mush your mind just as much as television 
does. For example, when was the last time you checked out Facebook, tweeted 
on Twitter, or just browsed down a rabbit hole online? Try inventorying the 
things you do in a few days or a week, and see how many mind-numbing activi-
ties you do and how much time it eats out of your day.

184
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
Mind-numbing activities have their place. Just don’t let these activities take up 
too much time in your life. Whether it be your heart health or mental health, 
limiting mind-numbing activities — or eliminating them altogether — benefits 
your mind, body, and soul.
Learning Something New
You can work several different parts of your brain just by learning something 
new. Whether you decide to learn one foreign phrase each day or challenge 
yourself to learn a new skill each month, newness gets your brain going. You 
work your memory as well as the way in which your brain associates things. 
In addition, learning something new takes focus and attention, both of which 
help you solve picture puzzles better. Plus, learning something new is a great 
break from solving puzzles if you need one.
 
You have to practice your new skill to best influence your brain’s activity. 
However, after you find that skill becoming routine, find something new to 
learn again.
Reading, Writing, and ’Rithmetic
Yep, just like your first-grade teacher told you, the three Rs keep your brain 
buzzing. Although all three of these activities stimulate your brain, reading 
challenges you to learn new words and process information. Challenge your-
self to read the news rather than listen or watch it. When you have a question 
about something, look it up and read about it — you might just learn some-
thing new. (For more on learning new things, check out the earlier section, 
“Learning Something New.”)
Writing encourages creativity, and you may need some creative ideas when it 
comes to solving bewildering picture puzzles. In addition, writing motivates 
you to sort things out and put things into perspective. Whether you blog, 
journal, or simply write a grocery list, you put mental organization into prac-
tice, not to mention remembering to get a gallon of milk.
Making the most of math during your day doesn’t require you to sit down 
and do a math workbook. Instead, work out life’s story problems. That trendy 
new outfit is 25 percent off. Buying in bulk may tempt you, but you need to 
decide whether it’s truly a good deal. Figure these kinds of things out without 
a calculator to stimulate your problem-solving skills, which come in handy 
when solving problematic picture puzzles.

185
 Chapter 3: Ten Ways to Build Your Brain for Better Solving
Clearing Your Mind
Clearing clutter from your mind frees you up to focus on other things, such as 
solving that picture puzzle you’ve been staring at for ten minutes. If you try 
to solve a puzzle while you also try to figure out what you need at the grocery 
store, put together a to-do list for tomorrow morning, and figure out how many 
hours have passed since you last ate, your eyes will glaze over in no time.
Free your mind from clutter before you sit down to solve a puzzle. You can 
best clear your head by simply jotting down the mental things that interrupt 
your focus and then find ways to combat those interruptions. For example, 
if you find yourself wanting to set up your to-do list while solving, decide to 
work on the to-do list first to put your mind at ease. If you worry over how 
much time has passed because you don’t want to miss an appointment, set a 
timer so that you don’t have to keep watching the clock.
Eating Right
We don’t have a specific diet plan to put you on, but you do need to eat right for 
mental health, not just physical health. Make low-fat, low-cholesterol foods part 
of your brain-healthy diet. Whole grain foods, fruits, veggies, lean meats, and a 
limited amount of healthy fats work together to keep your body and brain func-
tioning in a positive direction. And if your family and friends question a sudden 
change in your eating habits, let them know that you’re just in training.
 
Too much sugar and too few antioxidants — vitamins and other nutrients that 
help protect cells from the damage of free radicals — (you can find antioxi-
dants in foods, such as berries, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and beets) can 
hamper your mental performance.
Keeping Active
Your brain benefits from lower cholesterol, a strong heart, and increased 
levels of oxygen in your blood. You can achieve such things through physical 
activity. Get some fresh air, get your blood circulating and your heart pump-
ing (but not too hard), and stay active. As you increase your physical health, 
your mental health benefits as well.
 
By no means do we mean for you to stay up all day and night, putting into prac-
tice the tips and advice we’ve given you in this book. Keep active in a physical 
way, but don’t stay active 24 hours a day . . . or even 20. Both your brain and 
your body need rest to recharge and to think straight so get some sleep!
