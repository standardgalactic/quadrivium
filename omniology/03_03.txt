Problem 3.3 - Fitch System
Given (p ⇒ q) and (r ⇒ s), use the Fitch System to prove (p ∨ r ⇒ q ∨ s).
Start from the given premises. Apply rules of inference by checking the lines you wish to use as
premises and click the button for the desired rule of inference. Reiteration allows you to repeat an earlier
item. To delete one or more lines from a proof, check the desired lines and click Delete. Whenever
