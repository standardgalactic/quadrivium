Preface
It all started in my early days of PhD work at the University of Surrey, UK. I remember
that on my ﬁrst year and while searching for literature related to in-building radio
systems, to my surprise, there was not any book available on indoor radio networks at the
time. I had quick chats with some of my professors and co-students to see if they have
seen anything related at all; the answer was the same in all cases: there is nothing out
there - only papers and articles, that was all.
Later on and while working at Cellular Design Services, I again needed to search for
some reference material as we were in the middle of a very large project related to
wireless infrastructure in airports. The only things I could ﬁnd were chapters in some
books, which had scattered information and was a jig-saw puzzle task to put all the pieces
together. That is where I had the very ﬁrst idea of having a single book that could cover all
indoor radio aspects in a simple but useful way.
On my return to Mexico, I ﬁnally decided to start working on producing a book that
could fulﬁl all the needs from an engineer or specialist willing to work on in-building
radio design, covering many aspects of what I had learnt both in research and in industry.
This book includes materials and knowledge acquired after many years of experience
and hard work in the ﬁeld of indoor wireless communications. It goes from the very
basics of building characteristics and 'things to look at' when designing a radio network
in a certain type of building to more sophisticated propagation models, capacity
calculations and a chapter on case studies that covers practical aspects of real indoor
designs.
I believe this book can be very useful as a practical reference for scientists and
engineers involved in the design, planning and operational aspects of new infrastructures
for wireless communication systems inside buildings, a ﬁeld that is growing very rapidly
around the world. It could also be used as a text for graduate students or ﬁnal year
undergraduates willing to expand their knowledge in the ﬁeld of in-building radio
systems.
I am solely responsible not only for technical inaccuracies but also for typos. I would
appreciate any feedback to aaragon@itesm.mx, where comments, corrections or rec­
ommendations are welcome. An errata ﬁle will be kept and sent to anyone interested,
upon request.
First of all, I would like to thank Prof. Simon R. Saunders for all his help and support
during the writing of this book and for taking the time to contribute to the Small Cells
chapter. In particular, thanks Simon for your friendship all these years and for your
valuable guidance.

Introduction
1.1
Motivation
Currently around 70% of mobile usage is inside buildings and some analysts predict that
in the next few years around 90% of mobile usage will take place indoors (Paolini, 2011),
be it at home, in the ofﬁce or in public buildings, with the majority of that being in an
individual user's home and main ofﬁce locations. Traditionally such services have been
provided on an 'outside-in' basis from macrocells, which were originally deployed to
provide voice coverage to vehicles travelling along major roads. This conventional
architecture is increasingly limited in its ability to meet modern mobile users' needs for
reliable indoor mobile service because:
 The increased volume of mobile data use puts a greater load on macrocell capacity to
deliver a reliable service.
 User expectations of the minimum data rate that constitutes a viable service are
continuing to increase and are dominated by the indoor locations in which they mostly
consume services.
 Modern mobile devices have to support a wide range of frequency bands in a small-
form factor, reducing their sensitivity and hence increasing the signal strength needed
to achieve a given coverage.
 Improved thermal insulation properties of buildings lead to an increase in the use of
denser and more conductive external construction materials, including metallized
windows, increasing the losses that radio waves encounter in penetrating a building.
 Increased use of high-frequency bands at 2.1 GHz, 2.4 GHz, 2.6 GHz, 3.5 GHz and
beyond, which suffer greater losses than frequencies below 1 GHz.
 Economic incentives for mobile operators to share macrocell networks, reducing the
diversity of options for users to switch to operators who do have macrocell coverage
close to the locations they care most about.
In consumer surveys, mobile users frequently cite poor in-building coverage as the
number one network-related reason to turn to other operators. Increased mobile data
usage has changed customer priorities and expectations. Smartphone users rate the
importance of messaging and Internet quality 2.5 times higher than standard phone
users. Even the average phone user rated network quality as the most important reason
for choosing a mobile operator. Mobile Internet is much more demanding than a few
years ago, requiring Wi-Fi coverage as a 'default' commodity. All these factors increase

Indoor Wireless Communications
the need of specialized indoor radio technologies to satisfy such user expectations and
demands.
A recent global mobile consumer survey audit conducted by Deloitte (2012) examined
the use of Wi-Fi by mobile users and found:
 In the UK, Wi-Fi is the main Internet connection for smartphones at nearly 60%.
 The desire for faster, more reliable connectivity is the principal driver of Wi-Fi usage
over cellular mobile.
 Almost 90% of both smartphone and tablet users connect to the Internet using Wi-Fi
from home.
Given this and the potential loss in consumer and societal beneﬁts arising from poor
in-building services, it is very relevant to consider the planning and design of in-building
radio systems following a methodological and engineering approach, considering:
 The types of indoor wireless technologies and their characteristics
 Design requirements and standards for coverage and capacity
 Voice and data trafﬁc considerations when deploying an indoor radio solution
 The physics of in-building radio propagation
 Channel modelling options that are available to estimate coverage in an indoor radio
system
 Available RF and antenna equipment for indoor systems
 Measurement techniques and systems used to design and validate in-building
networks
 Practical issues related to indoor radio design and deployment that could be useful for
engineers, students and scientists.
1.2 Evolution of Macro to Heterogeneous Networks
The changing shape of mobile networks from the traditional macrocell approach to what
is known as heterogeneous networks or 'HetNets' (a mix of macro and small-cell
architectures) can both resolve issues for the operator but at the same time create
potential policy problems for telecommunications regulators, notably:
 Future demand for spectrum. The indoor layer of the network starts to soak up the
rapid increase in demand and the value of future mobile spectrum allocations may be
reduced.
 Interference management. Current policy stipulates that coordination between
multioperators should be resolved by each party. A market-driven change into the
network architecture may impact the regulatory policy in this area.
 Competition between MNOs. Competition may start to be reduced by the growing
use of multioperator collaborations on both the core network and on the Radio Access
Network.
 Incentives for investment. There may come a time when operators reduce their level
of investment in the macronetwork to focus on serving the indoor consumers with
smaller more cost effective building solutions.
 Consumer switching. This is encouraged by operators marketing their new products
and services.

3
1 Introduction
Traditionally, when MNOs ﬁrst deployed their mobile networks they were designed for:
 Wide area coverage
 Targeting mobile voice
 Roads/carphones.
However, in today's network topology the demand from users has dramatically shifted
towards the consumption of data anywhere, anytime, which has led to the following
trends:
 Usage is predominantly indoors (70-90% of the trafﬁc by volume) (Analysis Mason
Ltd, 2011).
 The indoor locations of relevance are predominantly just two per person (my home,
my ofﬁce), that is not just geographical coverage.
 Indoor coverage is often cited by operators as the number one network-related cause
of churn.
 Smartphones have poorer sensitivity than traditional phones - and it gets worse as
more bands are added.
 Even voice is increasingly on 3G and LTE: better link budget, but mainly 2.1 GHz
today.
 User expectation of what constitutes the minimum acceptable data rate increases with
time (as does expectation of typical rates).
 Building regulations increasingly specify thermal insulation requirements, which are
increasingly being met by metallized glass, signiﬁcantly increasing attenuation.
There are three broad indoor user environments to consider for in-building systems.
These are in the home, in the ofﬁce or in a public building/venue. There are distinct
differences in terms of both achieving coverage and satisfying capacity in each of these
environments that impact the scale of the market and the optimum technical solution
when considering indoor solutions.
1.3
Challenges
This book aims at presenting methods and techniques of how in-building coverage can
be enhanced relative to that provided by the existing (predominantly macrocell-based)
networks at predominantly a technical level but including also some commercial level
detail. For example, one particular challenge to be addressed for anyone interested in
designing an in-building radio system may be openness of any systems and we ask the
question: 'What do we mean by "allowing access to different operators"?' The following
points attempt to provide some possible solutions:
 One solution can simultaneously handle users with different operators.
 Solutions are cheap, unobtrusive and simple enough to permit multiples of them in
one location if needed.
 It could work for any operator and can be changed between operators at the user's
choice (but only phones from one operator at a time).
 It is easy and cheap to switch operators even if one 'box' cannot handle multiple
operators.

4
Indoor Wireless Communications
 Allow consumers to take action themselves rather than 'begging' an operator; for
example, three currently limit femtocells to those who they consider have a valid
coverage problem.
 How does this compare and contrast with being able to move your phone between
providers, move contracts between providers or move gateways/home hubs between
providers.
The increased use of Wi-Fi presents further challenges and issues to cellular operators
and good knowledge of the technology is mandatory for deploying a whole radio
network, as nowadays Wi-Fi needs to coexist with cellular and other wireless tech­
nologies. Following this trend, mobile operators are beginning to adopt Wi-Fi as a
complementary service as an in-building solution, principally to help ofﬂoading capacity
constrained parts of the network. However, there are still some technical issues from
Wi-Fi that, once overcome, will provide a more integrated solution for mobile operators.
The overriding issue for operators is one of cost: while macrocells have technical
challenges in addressing remaining in-building demand, they have the beneﬁt of
spreading the costs over large numbers of users, resulting in the former operator mantra
'outside-in always wins'. Provision of in-building systems for every building with a need
has hitherto been excessively expensive, in both equipment and professional services.
New technologies do provide opportunities to signiﬁcantly reduce the cost of
provision, but signiﬁcant work remains to encourage widespread roll-out of these
technologies, including consumer understanding, commercial incentives and regulatory
clarity. Some of these issues are to be reviewed throughout this book, illustrating some
concepts with case studies to make understanding much easier.
Finally, it is well known that buildings have a very large variety of shapes, partitions,
ﬂoors, materials, etc., which makes them very difﬁcult to be categorized for design
purposes. On top of this, propagation inside buildings is much more complex than in
open spaces, thus making the planning of an indoor radio network more challenging.
This book presents in a simple and complete way the physics of radio propagation inside
buildings as well as methods to design and plan indoor networks, considering various
technologies and a handful of mathematical models to use. Sufﬁcient references are
given at the end of each chapter for the interested reader to investigate further.
1.4 Structure of the Book
The book is organized into eleven chapters, including this chapter, the introduction to
the world of in-building radio systems. An overview of various indoor wireless tech­
nologies is given to the reader in Chapter 2, for a better perspective on the current
available technologies and their characteristics.
From a design perspective, the ﬁrst step is to establish a clear set of requirements.
Therefore, the reader is introduced in Chapter 3 to the speciﬁc requirements that any
indoor wireless system may have. These issues are discussed in detail, to make sure the
reader understands each and foresees the importance of taking them into account for a
successful system deployment. This includes the different types of indoor environments
present (corporate ofﬁce, airport, theatre, shopping centre, etc.) for a radio designer to
identify speciﬁc characteristics and additional requirements.

5
1 Introduction
Once all of the main requirements for an indoor system have been established, a study
of the propagation phenomena occurring in an in-building environment is needed. From
the propagation mechanisms to the scales of mobile signal variation, all aspects to be
considered in terms of radio propagation are covered in Chapter 4.
Channel models are explained in Chapter 5, for both narrowband and wideband fast
fading as well as for median path loss, speciﬁcally for indoor systems. The models are not
exclusive for any technology, but will cover all ranges of indoor wireless technologies, for
the reader to have a useful reference.
The antenna requirements listed in Chapter 6 will be discussed for the case of in-
building systems, referencing to some characteristics that indoor antennas must have.
Antenna theory is included for completeness, especially to avoid the need to refer to
specialized antenna books in addition to the information provided here.
Due to the importance that indoor radio measurements have in the in-building design
process, Chapter 7 is dedicated to measurements, starting with basic concepts and
highlighting important issues to be considered, from my experience over 10 years on
indoor wireless measurements. A section on indoor model tuning is included at the end
of the chapter, since this is a common practice in practical indoor wireless designs.
Capacity is presented in Chapter 8, which is one of the essential requirements for an
indoor wireless system. Careful planning and dimensioning will allow system resources
to be used efﬁciently, especially for those high-demanding applications involving indoor
scenarios. Data transmission-related issues that affect some indoor wireless systems are
also discussed here.
Chapter 9 is about RF and distribution systems and components used in in-building
radio systems. The aim of the chapter is to provide the reader with a deep survey on
existing equipment available for indoor wireless design, covering all technologies and
levels. Transmission lines have been included here to illustrate what can be used to
interconnect elements within the architecture of the distribution system, and not to
show any connection with users. Examples of commercial equipment are shown.
Chapter 10 presents a brief overview on small cells and their importance inside
buildings. Finally, Chapter 11 includes case studies for in-building designs, where a
design approach is applied for each study, having different parameters and technologies.

Indoor Wireless Technologies
This book is not exclusive of any indoor wireless technology; instead, an effort has been
made to present an overview of design, planning and deployment issues that may be
applicable to many wireless technologies. An understanding of the various standards and
protocols is therefore a necessary asset for any in-building radio planner or designer,
since nowadays the deployment of multioperator, multitechnology networks is becom­
ing more frequent.
This chapter aims at providing a brief overview of wireless technologies that are
frequently encountered inside buildings. Special emphasis is given to cellular and Wi-Fi,
two of the most important wireless technologies deployed inside buildings for which
coexistence and design issues need to be carefully considered.
2.1
Cellular
Perhaps one of the most revolutionizing developments in the communications industry
in the twentieth century has been the invention of the cellular concept. Since the creation
of ﬁxed telephony and other wired communication systems such as the telegraph, the
possibility of having mobility while holding a conversation seemed possible but maybe
not so feasible, as the size of electronic equipment still made it prohibitive for a device to
be portable within a reasonable cost. Nowadays, not only are mobile voice communica­
tions possible but also data communications are a reality with increasing data rates,
utilizing the spectrum more efﬁciently. It could be said that cellular has been one of the
wireless technologies that has mostly driven research and development efforts in the last
century, as users are demanding higher speeds, with connectivity everywhere and at
every time.
Interestingly enough, in-building cellular has also become a major breakthrough in
the history of cellular telephony. In the early days, the main objective was to deliver
sufﬁcient signal strength in geographical regions denoted as cells, which were mainly
outdoors. In-building coverage was achieved by ﬂooding the building with power from
surrounding base stations. As voice was the main driver and capacity was not a big issue,
this seemed to be enough for a few years. However, as larger facilities such as airports,
shopping centres, etc., demanded more capacity, the need to deploy dedicated in-
building networks was inevitable.
There have been various generations of cellular telephony that have been developed
throughout the years, including: GSM, AMPS, IS-95, WCDMA, IMT-2000, LTE,

HSPA, etc. All of them have their characteristics and particularities that need to be
understood when deploying in-building radio networks. Since the aim of this book is
not to provide a deep understanding of each of these standards, the key elements and
characteristics of each standard will be highlighted, especially those that are relevant
for indoor systems. For a nice and expanded overview of each of these technologies
please refer to Tolstrup (2011).
2.1.1
The Cellular Concept
In the early days of mobile telephony around the 1950s, coverage and capacity were
provided by a single transceiver, also known as BTS, capable of radiating sufﬁcient power
to illuminate a large area and thus provide service to users. Each BTS, generically known
as a base station (BS), was designed to cover, as completely as possible, a designated area
or cell. The main problem with this was the use of the available radio resources: even
having a trunked capacity, the number of users was very restricted. That is when the
concept of frequency reuse was introduced.
The frequency reuse strategy involved the division of the radio access network into
overlapping cells, as depicted in Figure 2.1, so that a cluster of frequencies could be
reused within a geographical area, minimizing the levels of interference and therefore
providing service to more users. In Figure 2.1 a cluster is made of seven cells, each having
a different channel (A-G) and can be reused. The idea of handover was also possible
since now users within an area could have seamless mobility between cells.
As will be discussed in Chapter 8, capacity in a cellular network aims at providing
service to users in a designated area. For in-building networks, a method commonly
employed to increase capacity is known as cell splitting, where smaller cells are utilised to
increase the frequency reuse pattern and take advantage of the propagation conditions in
the building to limit coverage levels. Sectorization is also employed, especially in
stadiums where high capacity is required, by the use of directional antennas to decrease
the co-channel interference at certain directions and accommodate more users.
For most cellular networks, regardless of the speciﬁc standard, there are two main
types of cell conﬁgurations. In an omnidirectional cell, the BS is depicted at the centre of
the cell and omnidirectional antennas are used (Figure 2.2a). For sector cells, the BS is
located on three of the six cell vertices, as shown in Figure 2.2b. Three- or six-cell sectors
are often found in cellular networks, many of them in a similar conﬁguration as the base
station shown in Figure 2.3.Figure depicting frequency reuse, where a cluster is made of seven cells, each having a different channel (A-G).
Figure 2.1 Frequency reuse.

Figure 2.3 Cellular base station.
As for many other radio communication systems, noise and interference are to be
minimized in order to guarantee an optimal service performance to provide a desired
quality-of-service. In particular, interference is of special relevance since the frequency
reuse permits the assignment of co-channel frequencies to cells at a minimum distance
so that interference levels can be kept within tolerable limits. This is particularly
important for indoor networks, since sector conﬁgurations are commonly deployed
and interference control is essential there. On the other hand, noise limits the capacity in
some cellular systems, as in the case of the uplink in WCDMA, so it should be properly
controlled.
A very brief overview of the key cellular technologies is presented in the following
sections, highlighting relevant aspects that need to be taken into account when designing
in-building radio networks.
2.1.2
GSM
Figure 2.4 shows the key elements of a standard GSM cellular network. The central hub
of the network is the mobile switching centre (MSC), often simply called the switch. This
provides connection between the cellular network and the public switched telephone
network (PSTN) and also between cellular subscribers. Details of the subscribers for
whom this network is the home network are held on a database called the home location

register (HLR), while the details of subscribers who have entered the network from
elsewhere are on the visitor location register (VLR). These details include authentication
and billing details, plus the current location and status of the subscriber. The coverage
area of the network is handled by a large number of base stations. The base station
subsystem (BSS) is composed of a base station controller (BSC), which handles the
logical functionality, plus one or several base transceiver stations (BTS) containing the
actual RF and baseband parts of the BSS. The BTSs communicate over the air interface
(AI) with the mobile stations (MS). The air interface includes all of the channel effects as
well as the modulation, demodulation and channel allocation procedures within the MS
and BTS. A single BSS may handle 50 calls and an MSC may handle some 100 BSSs.
GSM was originally licensed to operate in the 900 MHz band. More spectra were
allocated later on, in 1800 MHz, for a standard known as DCS1800. Both were deployed
in Europe, and many other countries in the world use the same frequency bands. In the
Americas, the bands 800 MHz and 1900 MHz are used for GSM.
Although GSM was mainly designed to provide voice services at a speed of 9.6 kbps,
some overhead was left in the data resources, so this overhead was used for transmitting
short messages, leading to the SMS service. Later on, some limited data capabilities were
included in the standard using packet data, introducing GPRS and EDGE. By using more
sophisticated modulation schemes, data rates of up to 200-300 kbps could be achieved.
GSM uses separate frequency bands for the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL). This
scheme is known as Frequency Division Duplex (FDD). The two bands are separated by
45 MHz on GSM900 and by 95 MHz on DCS1800. The spectrum allocated to GSM is
divided into 200-kHz channels, and each of these channels is divided into eight time slots
to be used as logical and trafﬁc channels.
Handovers in GSM are 'hard', which means that the mobile monitors the Rx level of
neighbouring cells and if the handover criteria is fulﬁlled (e.g. insufﬁcient signal level,
poor signal quality, etc.) the network commands the mobile to hand over to a new
serving cell, using a different channel. Handovers are possible between cells or between
sectors in a cell.
For GSM in-building systems, there are some considerations that are relevant to take into
account when planning and designing the network, and could be summarized as follows:
 Coverage is achieved either by macrocell penetration or a dedicated indoor cell using
distribution systems (antennas or leaky feeders) and adjusted so that dominance is
achieved inside the building.

11
2 Indoor Wireless Technologies
 Handover overlapping areas are desired to allow mobiles to have sufﬁcient time to
handoff between cells/sectors, especially in venues like airports where, for example,
handover from the macrocell to the indoor cell needs to be achieved right at the
entrance of the terminal building.
 Voice trafﬁc is dimensioned using trunking theory, as discussed in Chapter 8, and
more channels can be allocated depending on Grade of Service (GoS) requirements.
For larger trafﬁc demands in densely populated venues, such as airports, the system
can be upgraded by adding more capacity to the base stations and by performing
zoning or further cell splitting, thus enhancing the frequency reuse. Special care
should be taken to maintain C=I levels within specs.
 Capacity is limited by the number of available resources in the BTS and by trafﬁc
demands, which are ruled by trunking theory.
 Co-channel and adjacent-channel interference need to be considered and taken into
account, especially if sectors (zones) are deployed inside a building.
2.1.3
UMTS
The Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) was speciﬁed and selected
for 3G since the use of the spectrum is very efﬁcient. UMTS has a high rejection to
narrowband interference using Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA),
being thus very robust against frequency selective fading.
For UMTS cells, users share the same frequency, having a distinct spreading code. Thus,
most of radio planning for UMTS is based on noise and power control. Unlike GSM where
cells are assigned a different frequency, the intercell interference needs to be minimized.
There are two main types of UMTS radio systems: TDD and FDD. For TDD systems,
the same frequency is used for the UL and the DL, whereas for FDD systems different
frequencies are used for UL and DL. The latter is the most frequently used WCDMA
radio system and requires a paired set of bands and an equal bandwidth separated
95 MHz duplex distance throughout the band.
The frequency band 1920-1980 MHz is assigned for the UL for WCDMA-FDD and
2110-2170 MHz for DL. This is used worldwide, although WCDMA-TDD is used in a
few countries. Most operators are assigned two or three carriers in the 2.1 GHz band per
license, but considerations for reusing the GSM900 spectrum are being made to utilize it
for UMTS (Tolstrup, 2011).
In UMTS a spread spectrum signal is used, having a bandwidth of 5 MHz. A spreading
code is employed to spread the original narrowband signal throughout the spectrum.
Thus the signal becomes less sensitive to selective interference; for example, inter-
modulation products from narrowband services.
The concept of frequency reuse in UMTS can be understood in a slightly different way
to GSM. For UMTS the frequency reuse factor is 1 and different primary scrambling
codes (highly orthogonal) are used per cell.
One of the key parameters for UMTS signal quality is the energy-bit-per-noise density
ratio (Eb=N0). It is the reference point for link budget calculations and deﬁnes the
maximum data rate possible with a given noise - the higher the data rates, the stricter the
Eb=N0 requirements.
On the other hand, the quality of the pilot channel is measured as Ec=I0, which is the
energy per chip/interference density ratio measured on the pilot channel (CPICH).

12
Indoor Wireless Communications
When the user equipment (UE) detects two or more CPICH with similar levels, it will
enter soft handover. Thus, the UE constantly monitors the Ec=I0 of the serving cell and
adjacent cells and compares the quality of the Ec=I0 of the serving CPICH against the
quality of other measured CPICHs and trigger levels or thresholds to add or remove cells
from the neighbour list. The CPICH thus deﬁnes the cell size.
There are two types of handovers in UMTS. The softer handover occurs when a UE is
within the service area of cells originating from the same NodeB at the same power level,
using both RF links, using two separate codes in the DL. On the other hand, soft handover
occurs when a mobile is in the service area of two cells originating from a different
NodeB, and thus the mobile will use one RF link to both base stations; that is
macrodiversity.
Pilot pollution occurs when a mobile receives CPICH signals at similar levels from
other cells that are not in the neighbour list. This is the case when a distant macrocell
can be 'seen' in a high-rise building at one of the upper levels. This will cause
interference of the serving cell's CPICH, the so-called pilot pollution. This problem
can be solved if an indoor cell is installed inside the building and has dominance
(Tolstrup, 2011).
UMTS is very sensitive to noise control, since all trafﬁc is in the same frequency and all
signals from active UE need to reach the NodeB at the same level. If one UE reaches the
UL of the NodeB at a much higher level, it will interfere with all the other UEs in service
on the same cell. Therefore, noise and power control are very important for UMTS
networks.
The load of a UMTS cell determines to a great extent the soft capacity, as more trafﬁc
will bring more noise to the cell. Therefore, the load needs to be limited to around 60% to
65% in indoor cells as they are more isolated from macros and can in principle be loaded
relatively high (Tolstrup, 2011).
The main issues that should be considered when designing UMTS indoor networks
can be summarized as follows:
 Interference management and control should be very strict, as all cells share the same
frequency.
 Power limits DL capacity, so sufﬁcient antennas should be used to provide dedicated
indoor coverage.
 Noise limits UL capacity; therefore low noise devices should be employed in the front
end of any distribution system.
 Soft handover areas should be minimized, as this requires doubling the use of
overhead and network resources.
 In-building cell dominance should be guaranteed if a dedicated indoor solution is
being deployed, as this minimizes the risk of pilot pollution.
2.1.4
HSPA
HSPA was developed to improve the speed of data rates in 3G cellular networks. It
consists of an addition to the existing 3G network infrastructure and utilizes the power
headroom not used by UMTS trafﬁc channels. In the DL, data rates of 14.4 Mbps can be

13
2 Indoor Wireless Technologies
achieved and its best performance is achieved by deploying indoor DAS (Tolstrup, 2011).
Data speeds are related to SNR and good radio links are obtained if antennas are closer to
mobiles, as is the case of indoor DAS.
2.1.5
LTE
With the use of advanced and adaptive modulation schemes and MIMO, much higher
data rates have been achieved. This is one of the key elements of long-term evolution
(LTE), with downlink data speeds in the range of 100 Mbps and uplink speeds of up to
50 Mbps, which is based on the existing GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSPA standards.
Flexible bandwidths from 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz are also employed in LTE, ensuring
compatibility with older networks and enough ﬂexibility for network roll-out and
deployment. In terms of spectrum efﬁciency LTE is three to four times better than
HSPA (Tolstrup, 2011).
Indoor environments, as discussed in Chapter 4, are rich multipath environments,
which for GSM networks, for example, are a challenge for power control and selective
fading issues. However, since LTE utilizes 2  2 MIMO, a strong multipath is much
more beneﬁcial, since it employs the scattering of the local clutter (short reﬂections) to
create multipath parallel links at the same time, frequency and space, thus theoreti­
cally doubling the throughput of the channel. LTE uses advanced and adaptive
modulation techniques so that for good radio links (closer to the base station or
eNodeB), higher-order modulation is employed (64-QAM), whereas as the link quality
is degraded (farther away from the eNodeB), lower modulation schemes are used such
as QPSK.
In terms of mobility, LTE is optimized to support a maximum data rate for
pedestrian speed (0-15 km/h) and still provide high-performance data throughput
for 15-350 km/h, being functional for 350-500 km/h to support high-speed trains
(Tolstrup, 2011).
LTE can operate in a paired spectrum for duplex operation (FDD), and therefore can
be deployed in existing GSM or UMTS systems. It can also be deployed in an unpaired
spectrum (TDD). The different LTE frequencies and bands used in different countries
will mean that only multiband phones will be able to use LTE in all countries where it is
supported.
Some key features of the LTE air interface can then be summarized as follows:
 Low data transfer latencies (sub-5 ms latency for small IP packets in optimal
conditions), lower latencies for handover and connection setup time than with
previous radio access technologies.
 Peak download rates up to 299.6 Mbit/s and upload rates up to 75.4 Mbit/s depending
on the user equipment category (with 4  4 MIMO using 20 MHz of spectrum). Five
different terminal classes have been deﬁned from a voice centric class up to a high end
terminal that supports the peak data rates. All terminals will be able to process 20 MHz
bandwidth.
 Improved support for mobility, exempliﬁed by support for terminals moving at up to
350 km/h (220 mph) or 500 km/h (310 mph) depending on the frequency band.
 OFDMA for the downlink and SC-FDMA for the uplink to save power.

14
Indoor Wireless Communications
 Support for both FDD and TDD communication systems as well as half-duplex FDD
with the same radio access technology.
 Support for all frequency bands currently used by IMT systems by ITU-R.
 Increased spectrum ﬂexibility: 1.4 MHz, 3 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz, 15 MHz and 20 MHz
wide cells are standardized.
 Support for cell sizes from tens of metres radius (femto- and picocells) up to 100 km
(62 miles) radius macrocells. In the lower frequency bands to be used in rural areas,
5 km (3.1 miles) is the optimal cell size, 30 km (19 miles) having reasonable perform­
ance, and up to 100 km cell sizes supported with acceptable performance. In city and
urban areas, higher frequency bands (such as 2.6 GHz in the EU) are used to support
high-speed mobile broadband. In this case, cell sizes may be 1 km (0.62 miles) or
even less.
 Simpliﬁed architecture. The network side of E-UTRAN is composed only of eNodeBs.
 Support for interoperation and coexistence with legacy standards (e.g., GSM/EDGE,
UMTS and CDMA2000). Users can start a call or transfer data in an area using an LTE
standard and, should coverage be unavailable, continue the operation without any
action on their part using GSM/GPRS or W-CDMA-based UMTS or even 3GPP2
networks such as cdmaOne or CDMA2000.
 Packet-switched radio interface.
 Support for MBSFN (Multicast-Broadcast Single Frequency Network). This feature
can deliver services such as Mobile TV using the LTE infrastructure, and is a
competitor forDVB-H-based TV broadcast.
The LTE standard covers a range of many different bands, each of which is
designated by both a frequency and a band number. In North America, 700, 750,
800, 850, 1900, 1700/2100 (AWS), 2500 and 2600 MHz (Rogers Communications, Bell
Canada) are used (bands 2, 4, 7, 12, 13, 17, 25, 26, 41); 2500 MHz in South America;
700, 800, 900, 1800, 2600 MHz in Europe (bands 3, 7, 20); 800, 1800 and 2600 MHz in
Asia (bands 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, 40) and 1800 MHz and 2300 MHz in Australia and New
Zealand (bands 3, 40).
There are various challenges that are envisaged when designing LTE indoor systems,
which can be summarized as follows:
 Leveraging the maximum performance from MIMO systems, requiring in-building
systems designed to provide a sufﬁciently multipath rich environment while still
achieving a high SNR.
 Designing LTE systems that can in principle co-exist with WCDMA or HSPA
networks, having the capability to accommodate more capacity as the network grows.
 Performing a very careful interference management, especially in areas where LTE
femtocells are deployed.
2.2 Wi-Fi
2.2.1
History
The Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) have been around for a few years, evolving
from simple low data rate technologies towards more sophisticated and powerful

15
2 Indoor Wireless Technologies
Figure 2.5 History of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN).
protocols. Let us have a brief timeline perspective in the evolution of this technology
(Figure 2.5).
1985. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) releases the ISM (Industrial,
Scientiﬁc and Medical) band for the use of radio frequency (RF) energy for industrial,
scientiﬁc and medical purposes other than communications. This is meant to be an
unlicensed band. Over the years, the need to have more spectrum available for short-
range, low-power communications systems has pushed regulatory bodies to allow its
use for applications such as cordless phones, Bluetooth devices and WLAN systems.
1991. NCR Corporation and AT&T, in a joint venture, invented the precursor to 802.11
in Nieuwegein, The Netherlands, intended to be used in cashier systems. The very ﬁrst
wireless products were under the name WaveLAN with data rates of 1 Mbps and
2 Mbps.
1992. CSIRO (The Commonwealth Scientiﬁc and Industrial Research Organisation)
obtained patents for a method used to 'unsmear' signals produced by WLAN
networks.
1993. Public access WLANs were ﬁrst proposed by Henrik Sjödin at the Net­
World+Interop Conference in The Moscone Center in San Francisco in August
1993. Sjödin did not use the term 'hotspot' but referred to publicly accessible wireless
LANs.
1997. The technology is adopted by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers) and the working group 802.11 is created to create standards related to
WLANs.
1999. The Wi-Fi Alliance was formed. The IEEE released standards 802.11a (5 GHz,
54 Mbps) and 802.11b (2.4 GHz, 11 Mbps). This year was the ﬁrst time in which the
term 'Wi-Fi' was used commercially.
2000. During the dot-com period in 2000, dozens of companies had the notion that Wi-
Fi could become the payphone for broadband. The original notion was that users
would pay for broadband access at hotspots. Since then, both paid and free hotspots
continue to grow. Wireless networks that cover entire cities, such as municipal
broadband, have mushroomed. Wi-Fi hotspots can be found in remote RV/Camp­
ground Parks across the US.

16
Indoor Wireless CommunicationsFigure (right) depicting the concept of a WLAN interfacing with a wired network, whereas the logical architecture of a WLAN is also depicted on the left.
Figure 2.6 Generic Wi-Fi block diagram.
2003. The IEEE releases the 802.11g standard, which is compatible to the 802.11b but
can work at higher data rates, up to 54 Mbps using the 2.4 GHz frequency band.
2009. The latest standard released by the IEEE related to WLAN is the 802.11n, having
MIMO capabilities, with potential data rates of up to 600 Mbps using special
combinations of modulation and coding schemes. It also operates at 2.4 GHz.
2010. Most laptop computers come equipped with internal WLAN adapters as well as
integrated antennas, something that facilitates its use, especially in hotspots.
Most WLAN operate over unlicensed frequencies at near Ethernet speeds using
carrier-sense protocols to share a radio wave. The majority of these devices are capable of
transmitting information between computers within an open environment. Figure 2.6
(right) illustrates the concept of a WLAN interfacing with a wired network, whereas the
logical architecture of a WLAN is also shown in Figure 2.6 (left).
In general, WLAN perform the following functions to enable the transfer of infor­
mation from source to destination:
 The medium provides a bit pipe (a path for data ﬂow) for the transmission of data.
 Medium access techniques facilitate the sharing of a common medium.
 Synchronization and error control mechanisms ensure that each link transfers the
data intact.
 Routing mechanisms move the data from the originating source to the intended
destination.
 Connectivity software interfaces an appliance to application software hosted on a
server.
2.2.2
Medium Access Control (MAC) Sublayer
The MAC enables multiple appliances to share a common transmission medium via a
carrier sense protocol similar to Ethernet. This protocol enables a group of wireless
computers to share the same frequency and space. A WLAN MAC provides reliable
delivery of data over somewhat error-prone wireless media. The protocol used for this
purpose is Carrier Sense Multiple Access, where appliances can transmit only if the
channel is 'idle' to avoid collisions.

17

2.2.3
Physical Layer
The physical layer provides for the transmission of bits through a communication
channel by deﬁning electrical, mechanical and procedural speciﬁcations. Modulation
and multiple access methods are therefore deﬁned as part of the physical layer.
2.2.4
Industry Bodies
The three main Wi-Fi industry bodies related to WLAN technology are: the Wi-Fi
Alliance, the IEEE 802.11 working group, and the Wireless Broadband Alliance. A brief
description of each follows.
2.2.4.1
Wi-Fi Alliance
The Wi-Fi Alliance (2015) is a trade association that promotes wireless LAN technology
and certiﬁes products if they conform to certain standards of interoperability. Not every
IEEE 802.11-compliant device is submitted for certiﬁcation to the Wi-Fi Alliance,
sometimes because of costs associated with the certiﬁcation process. The lack of the
Wi-Fi logo does not necessarily imply a device is incompatible with Wi-Fi devices.
The Wi-Fi Alliance owns the Wi-Fi trademark. Manufacturers may use the trademark
to brand certiﬁed products that belong to a class of wireless local area network (WLAN)
devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards. One of the beneﬁts of certiﬁcation of
products towards the Wi-Fi Alliance is that interoperability amongst vendors is
guaranteed.
2.2.4.2
IEEE 802.11
The IEEE 802.11 (2015) is a working group established by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical
and Electronic Engineers) in the USA specializing in developing WLAN standards and
amendments. Therefore, the IEEE 802.11 is a set of standards for implementing wireless
local area network (WLAN) computer communication in the 2.4 GHz, 3.6 GHz and
5 GHz frequency bands. They are created and maintained by the IEEE LAN/MAN
Standards Committee (IEEE 802). The base version of the standard IEEE 802.11-2007
has had subsequent amendments. These standards provide the basis for wireless network
products using the Wi-Fi brand name.
2.2.4.3
The Wireless Broadband Alliance
The Wireless Broadband Alliance (2015) was established in 2003 by a group of telecom
operators and is integrated by representatives from international broadband, cellular and
integrated operators. The founders of this Alliance viewed Wi-Fi as an integral and
strategic complement to other wireless and broadband networks such as 3G/UMTS,
WiMAX, DSL, Cable and more.
WBA was created to support and further the vision of ubiquitous and seamless
wireless broadband services. The mission of WBA is to facilitate adoption of Wi-Fi
enabled services through improvements in user experience, interoperability and service
delivery across technologies, devices and networks. By leveraging on the strengths of its
unique membership mix and strong operator heritage, WBA seeks to engage the
ecosystem for enabling a seamless Wi-Fi experience with the beneﬁt of the end-user
in mind.

Wi-Fi Standards
Within the IEEE 802.11 Working Group, a series of IEEE Standards exist, as depicted in
Table 2.1. These are explained in this section.
2.2.5.1
IEEE 802.11-1997
The WLAN standard was originally 1 Mbit/s and 2 Mbit/s (Mbps), 2.4 GHz RF and
infrared (IR) standard (1997). Although the IR was considered in the standard, it was
never implemented in commercial products. This standard is now a legacy only, as it is
obsolete.
2.2.5.2
IEEE 802.11a
54 Mbps, 5.25, 5.6 and 5.8 GHz frequency bands, uses OFDM as its modulation scheme,
having a bandwidth of 20 MHz (1999, shipping products in 2001).
2.2.5.3
IEEE 802.11b
Enhancements to 802.11 to support 5.5 and 11 Mbps, uses CCK modulation and
operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band, also having a bandwidth of 20 MHz (1999).
2.2.5.4
IEEE 802.11g
Enhanced 802.11b standard, totally compatible, 54 Mbps, 2.4 GHz standard, also uses
OFDM modulation with a 20 MHz bandwidth (backwards compatible with b) (2003).
2.2.5.5
IEEE 802.11-2007
A new release of the standard that includes amendments a, b, d, e, g, h, i and j (July 2007).
2.2.5.6
IEEE 802.11n
Higher throughput improvements using MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output anten­
nas), BPSK/QPSK/QAM modulation combinations, 54-600 Mbps, working also in the
2.4 GHz band, with a bandwidth of 20/40 MHz (2010).

19
2 Indoor Wireless Technologies
2.2.6
Spectrum
Wi-Fi has been allocated portions of the spectrum that can be used depending on the
regions of the world and also whether newer standards are deployed. In the beginning,
the ISM band in the 2.4 GHz was allocated for 802.11b/g usage, having 76 MHz of
spectrum divided in 14 channels with 5 MHz separation, each of 22 MHz bandwidth. For
the 802.11a/n standards, the 5 GHz band is used. The unlicensed 3.6 GHz band is only
used in the USA for 802.11y networks, having 14 channels of 5/10/20 MHz of bandwidth.
Finally, the 60 GHz band is intended for use in the future, with expected very high data
rates (802.11a/d).
In addition to these frequency allocations, not all the channels can be used in every
country. For example, in North America, channels 1 to 11 are used for the 2.4 GHz
band, whereas in Europe, channels 1 to 13 are used. On the other hand, power levels
are restricted and should not be exceeded, as Wi-Fi operates in unlicensed bands,
interference should be minimized. There is in fact lack of protection in the unlicensed
spectrum, suffering from potential interference from other systems, network security
issues and, as in the case of the ISM, lots of congestion from other wireless services and
technologies.
2.2.6.1
2.4 GHz Band
There are 14 channels in the 2.4 GHz spectrum available for WLAN use, as shown in
Figure 2.7. Note that depending on local and regional regulations, not all the
channels can be used; for example, in the US and Canada, channels 1 to 11 can
be used; in Europe, channels 1 to 13 can be used (in the early days of WLAN, Spain
and France were restricted to only use channels 11 to 13, but this restriction has been
removed).
The bandwidth of each channel is 22 MHz, although the channel separation is only
5 MHz. This channel spacing governs the use and allocation of channels in a multi-AP
(access point) environment, such as an ofﬁce or campus. APs are usually deployed in a
cellular fashion within an enterprise, where adjacent APs are allocated non-overlapping
channels.
Figure 2.7 2.4 GHz channel allocations.

20
Indoor Wireless Communications
According to Figure 2.7, only three non-overlapping channels can be used at a time;
therefore careful channel assignment should be done to avoid interference in WLAN
networks.
As a sidenote, Japan is the only country in the world for which the fourteen channels
are available in the spectrum - this is due to its very high utilization. According to the
frequency map shown in Figure 2.7, Japan can thus have four non-overlapping channels
for use.
2.2.6.2
5 GHz Band
Figure 2.8 shows the channel allocation for the 5 GHz frequency band, used mainly in the
802.11a and 802.11n standards. The centre frequency is shown for each case; the
frequency of the channel is 10 MHz on either side of the dotted line. There is 5 MHz of
separation between channels and thus special care should be taken when doing channel
planning to avoid co-channel interference issues.
There are some restrictions and limitations in the use of the 5 GHz band for WLAN
use, which are summarized as follows:
 Since other wireless systems such as radar operate in the same band, it is very likely
that for some environments and regions, the use of Wi-Fi in the 5 GHz band could be
very restricted.
 Path loss increases with frequency, so at 5 GHz there is substantially more path loss
than at 2.4 or 3.6 GHz. This forces the use of more APs at 5 GHz than at lower
frequency bands to cover the same area.
 Power control is not considered in the 802.11 standard, so it is required to implement
transmit power control and dynamic frequency selection in the network to maximize
performance.
Table 2.2 shows the frequency allocations in different parts of the world for the 5 GHz
WLAN service.

Modulation Schemes Used in Wi-Fi
Modulation, which is a physical layer function, is a process in which the radio transceiver
prepares the digital signal within the network interface card (NIC) for transmission over
the channel. An analogue carrier is sent over the radio interface, for which its amplitude,
frequency or phase is changed in proportion to the digital message. For example, for
BPSK, the phase of the carrier is changed according to the digital message, using two
symbols (0 and 1) - hence the name BPSK. If two bits are used to produce four symbols
(00, 01, 10 and 11) and then these symbols are mapped to phase changes, then QPSK is
produced. By combining some of these modulation techniques with coding it is possible
to send more bits in the same timeframe, protecting the message against noise and
interference. This has the beneﬁt of increasing the efﬁcient data rate.
2.2.8
Multiple Access (MA) Techniques
On the other hand, three MA techniques are often used in WLAN: direct sequence
spread spectrum (DSSS), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and
frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS).
2.2.8.1
Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)
Frequency-hopping works very much as it name implies. The signal hops from frequency
to frequency as a function of time over a wide band of frequencies, as shown in Figure 2.9.
A hopping code determines the frequencies the radio will transmit and in which order.
To receive the signal properly, the receiver must be set to the same hopping code and
listen to the incoming signal at the right time and correct frequency.

22
Indoor Wireless CommunicationsFigure depicting frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS).
Figure 2.9 Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS).
The frequency-hopping technique reduces interference because an interfering signal
from a narrowband system will affect the spread spectrum signal only if both are
transmitting at the same frequency at the same time. Thus, the aggregate interference
will be very low, resulting in few or no bit errors.
FHSS is rarely used nowadays for WLANs.
2.2.8.2
Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)
Spread spectrum techniques 'spreads' a signal's power over a wide band of frequencies, as
seen in Figure 2.10, sacriﬁcing bandwidth in order to gain signal-to-noise performance;
that is process gain. This contradicts the desire to conserve frequency bandwidth, but the
spreading process makes the data signal much less susceptible to electrical noise than
otherwise would be achieved. Other transmission and electrical noise, typically narrow in

resulting in much less interference and fewer errors.A power-frequency plot depicting direct sequence spread spectrum. Three different curves are representing wideband signal, narrowband signal, and narrowband interferer.

In particular, the direct sequence spread spectrum combines a data signal at the
sending station with a higher data rate bit sequence, also known as the chipping code. A
high processing gain increases the signal's resistance to interference. The direct
sequence, having higher potential data rates than FHSS, would be best for band­
width-intensive applications.
2.2.8.3
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)
Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a frequency-division multi­
plexing (FDM) scheme used as a digital multicarrier modulation method. A large
number of closely spaced orthogonal subcarriers are used to carry data, as shown in
Figure 2.11. The data are divided into several parallel data streams or channels, one for
each subcarrier. Each subcarrier is modulated with a conventional modulation scheme
(such as quadrature amplitude modulation or phase-shift keying) at a low symbol rate,
maintaining total data rates similar to conventional single-carrier modulation schemes
in the same bandwidth.
OFDM has developed into a popular scheme for wideband digital communication,
whether wireless or over copper wires, used in applications such as digital television and
audio broadcasting, wireless networking and broadband Internet access.
The primary advantage of OFDM over single-carrier schemes is its ability to cope with
severe channel conditions (for example, attenuation of high frequencies in a long copper
wire, narrowband interference and frequency-selective fading due to a multipath)
without complex equalization ﬁlters. Channel equalization is simpliﬁed because
OFDM may be viewed as using many slowly modulated narrowband signals rather
than one rapidly modulated wideband signal. The low symbol rate makes the use of aA graphical representation for OFDM characteristics, where spectrum is plotted on the y-axis on a scale of -0.4-1.2 and frequency on the x-axis on a scale of -10-10. Dashed, solid, and dashed-solid curves are representing  subcarriers, central subcarrier, and total spectrum, respectively.

guard interval between symbols affordable, making it possible to eliminate intersymbol
interference (ISI) and utilize echoes and time-spreading (that shows up as ghosting on
analogue TV) to achieve a diversity gain, that is a signal-to-noise ratio improvement.
This mechanism also facilitates the design of single-frequency networks (SFNs), where
several adjacent transmitters send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency,
as the signals from multiple distant transmitters may be combined constructively, rather
than interfering as would typically occur in a traditional single-carrier system.
OFDM was ﬁrst introduced in the 802.11a standard and was then taken again for the
802.11g having improved data rates. Figure 2.12 shows an example of the architecture used in
anOFDMsystemoftenemployedinWLAN.Awidebandchannelisassumedforthisexample.
2.2.9
Power Levels
In terms of maximum power levels that can be transmitted per AP, there are regulations
in terms of maximum EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power) limits per standard.
Recall that EIRP refers to the maximum radiated power transmitted by the antenna
taking into account antenna gain and cable losses (in dB):
EIRP  AP transmit power  cable losses  antenna gain
(2.1)
Table 2.3 shows EIRP maximum levels for 802.11b/g and 802.11a standards. Special
care should be taken here when choosing antennas for the APs, since according to the
EIRP equation, higher antenna gain would be proportionally converted in an increase of
the EIRP. This is the case, for example, when coverage is to be enhanced and highly
directional antennas (such as Yagi-Uda) are used for 'bridging' two buildings.
There is another parameter that is often confused with EIRP, called ERP (effective
radiated power). The difference is that EIRP takes as a reference the antenna gain
with respect to an isotropic radiator (dBi) and ERP takes as a reference for antenna gain a
half-wave dipole (dBi). In fact, ERP and EIRP are related by a factor of 2.15 (gain of a half-
wave dipole in dBi).

Performance Indicators
To assess Wi-Fi performance, curves of SINR (signal-to-interference and noise ratio)
versus throughput for 802.11b/g are shown in Figure 2.13, with a bandwidth of 20 MHz.
Recall that the SINR determines the performance of a Wi-Fi network since it establishes
the minimum signal level above noise and interference for proper operation. Various
modulation schemes are shown, starting with BPSK with low spectral efﬁciency (but high
noise resistance) and ending with a high-level QAM modulation, which offers very high
spectral efﬁciency at the expense of being more vulnerable to noise. Notice how as the
number of symbols increase, more throughput is achievable but higher SINRs are
required. These curves are considered for an OFDM system.
Similar curves to the ones shown in Figure 2.13 are presented in Figure 2.14, now for
802.11n having a bandwidth of 40 MHz. A similar behaviour is observed; as the
throughput is increased and multilevel modulation is used, the SINR requirement
also increases. Wi-Fi designers should take this into account when calculating the link
budgets according to given throughput requirements.
2.2.11
Target Signal Levels and Link Budgets
As an example, assume there is a need to deploy a WLAN 802.11g network, having
60 Mbps for data (SINR of 18.8 dB) and a voice requirement of 25 dB, according to
equipment vendor's speciﬁcations. Table 2.4 shows the calculations needed for this.
 An EIRP of 100 mW is used to account for maximum power level regulations (which
are always speciﬁed in a maximum EIRP). Therefore, the transmit antenna gain is
irrelevant - a word of caution, be careful not to use highly directive antennas without
adjusting the transmit power from the AP, otherwise the maximum EIRP limits will be
superseded!
 The maximum acceptable path loss (MAPL) is calculated depending on the SINR
levels as given by the requirements.

Indoor Wireless Communications
Figure 2.13 802.11b/g Wi-Fi performance.
 Noise contributions are taken from the noise ﬂoor level + noise ﬁgure of the client
device, which in this case is assumed to be 20 dB.
 Interference is assumed to be 87 dBm from a co-channel nearby AP.
 A bandwidth of 20 MHz is taken for 802.11g channels.
A need to account for a sufﬁcient interference margin in the design has to be considered,
as well as a shadowingmargin- the MAPL value obtained only represents the median path
loss. This is especially critical for densely cluttered environments, where location varia­
bility tends to be quite large. For example, assuming a location variability of 12 dB and a
90% cell-edge conﬁdence percentile, a fade margin for shadowing of 15.4 dB is to be
considered, and hence the MAPL value with this margin is adjusted to only 96.6 dB.
Data rates affect AP coverage areas. Lower data rates, such as 1 Mbps, can extend the
coverage area farther from the AP than higher data rates, such as 54 Mbps. Thus, the data
rate and power level affects coverage and consequently the number of APs required. This
is illustrated in Figure 2.15, where simulations have been performed to estimate the
effects of throughput on coverage, assuming the ITU indoor model is used - refer to
Chapter 4 for more details about the model.

Figure 2.15 Impact of targets on range: (a) 2.4 GHz; (b) 5 GHz.
Different data rates are achieved by the AP sending a redundant signal on the wireless
link, allowing data to be more easily recovered from noise. The number of symbols in a
packet for lower data rates is greater than that for a higher data rate, so sending data at
lower data rates takes longer. Therefore, clients working at lower data rates slow the
network and thus it is preferable to limit the WLAN for higher data rates and force those
clients further away to roam to closer APs. In a way, it seems better to have more APs at
lower power than fewer APs transmitting at higher power, having the risk of slowing
down the performance of the network.
Figure 2.16 shows a picture of the estimated ranges (not to scale) as the data
throughput varies for 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. The coverage is reduced as the throughput

is increased. If an overlap of 30% is considered between APs, this coverage range is
further reduced - this should be considered when performing WLAN coverage design.
2.2.12
Interference Challenges
Interference is one of the key elements to take into consideration in WLAN networks,
since it can degrade the performance of the system based on the MAC protocols used.
These interference sources can be subdivided into three types:
 Co-channel interference. This comes as a result of either other Wi-Fi networks within
range using the same channel or non-Wi-Fi systems transmitting in the same band.
Examples of this include: microwave ovens, baby monitors, Bluetooth devices, cordless
phones, etc. This kind of interference is seen as one of the worst ones, as uncontrolled
emissions from in-band appliances can severely affect WLAN performance.
 Adjacent channel interference. This is caused by overlapping channels interfering with
contiguous ones. According to the IEEE standards, for 802.11b/g, the adjacent channel
rejection should be of at least 35 dB at 25 MHz from the centre frequency of the
receiver.
 Out-of-band interference: caused by spurious emissions from out-of-band appliances.
An out-of-band transmit power of 13 dBm=MHz is recommended according to IEEE
standards.
For the CSMA/CD protocol (carrier-sense multiple access/collision detection), AP
transmit only if the channel is clear; that is idle. If the channel is busy, transmission is not
allowed. Since in the standard there is no channel reservation or scheduling, two APs can
detect the signal clear and both transmit at the same time, hence producing collisions
and reducing the throughput. Also, something else to notice is that carrier sensing can be
triggered by non-WiFi signals (e.g. spurious emissions from other appliances), thus
making the channel seem 'busy' and hence a reduction of throughput is experienced.
Beacon packets can also stop nodes to transmit as the channel is seen 'busy', even when
no user trafﬁc is detected.
2.2.13
Channel Planning
Since Wi-Fi channels overlap, a careful selection should be made to avoid adjacent
channel interference problems. As can be seen in Figure 2.17, for example, channels 1, 6
and 11 can be chosen in contiguous cells since these do not overlap; a partial overlap
Figure 2.17 Wi-Fi channel planning.

30
Indoor Wireless Communications
channel plan selecting channels 3, 8 and 13 overlaying this can also be deployed, and can
be used to reduce interference in the second tier. The patterns are to be repeated to
guarantee a minimum SINR. For this, cells are deployed either in same-ﬂoor or vertical-
ﬂoor conﬁgurations to make use of the propagation characteristics of the building and
the high transmission losses associated with walls and ﬂoors.
For data networks, too much overlapping is not required; this is mainly determined
by data rate speciﬁcations. In general, data links can accept less stringent latency
requirements and can in principle reduce the data rate if coverage is low - this will
only have the effect of reducing the throughput but the link will be kept operating. In
fact, clients respond to low signal strength by stepping down data rate and taking
longer to transmit.
For voice networks, more overlap is needed, since voice clients should roam to a better
AP before dropping packets, in a similar way for handovers in cellular. Also, smaller cells
are required, to reduce latency processor load in handheld and increase link stability.
2.2.13.1
Single-Floor and Vertical Channel Planning
For single-ﬂoor channel planning, sufﬁcient overlap should be allowed for seamless
connectivity, especially for voice deployments. The overlap can be 50% because of
channel separation and the minimum recommended is 15%. Co-located non-over­
lapping channels should be chosen in contiguous AP footprints (cells) to minimize
adjacent channel interference. The cell pattern should be repeated only when sufﬁcient
SINR levels are achieved; that is avoid reusing channel numbers in low SINR level
regions.
Finally, as discussed earlier, the coverage area is not only dependent on transmit
power, antenna gain and the environment but also on data rate. For example, at 2.4 GHz
and transmitting at 100 mW for 2 Mbps, a coverage diameter of 132 m can be achieved. If
the data rate is increased, this coverage is reduced to only 70 m having the same transmit
power. Therefore, if the minimum overlap is accounted for, for 2 Mbps, four APs are
needed to cover an area of 250  250 m2. Likewise, for 11 Mbps, 16 APs would then be
needed to cover the same area.
When using vertical channel separation, the idea is to co-locate non-overlapping
channels in a vertical separation (different ﬂoors), as depicted in Figure 2.18, taking
Figure  dep icting v ertical  channel separation.

31
2 Indoor Wireless Technologies
advantage of the high transmission losses due to the signal penetrating ﬂoors. This
reduces the possibility of co-channel interference by using ﬂoor attenuation to separate
channels, as indicated in Figure 2.17. The pattern can therefore be reused in a different
ﬂoor as long as the SINR level is sufﬁciently high.
2.2.13.2
Multichannel Access Points
The idea of multichannel access points is to enhance throughput over a conventional AP
by supporting multiple SSIDs and radios in the same unit. For example, an 802.11b PDA
user at a moderate distance from an AP brings today's single-channel 802.11g network
down from 54 Mbps to close to 1 Mbps. Therefore, WLAN systems must contend with
an unpredictable and heterogeneous client environment, something that has been
happening in recent years. At the same time, end users want to add services beyond
just data, such as VoWIP. By having multiple channels operating from the same access
point, we are able to partition the client trafﬁc to dramatically enhance throughput. As
end-users deploy new services on to their WLAN system, Engim enables these services
to be partitioned intelligently and implemented on the same WLAN system.
2.2.13.3
Automated Planning
Radio resource management (RRM), also known as Auto-RF, can adjust the channel
(dynamic channel assignment) and power (dynamic transmit power control) to maintain
the RF coverage area. It adjusts the power level of the AP to maintain a baseline signal
strength with neighbouring APs at 65 dBm (conﬁgurable). It adjusts the channel of the
AP when it notices nearby interference sources on the channel on which the AP is
currently located. It continues to optimize the RF coverage for the best reception and
throughput for the wireless network.
RRM understands that the RF environment is not static. As different RF affecting
variables change (people in the room, amount of devices stored in the facility, leaves on
trees for outside deployment, interference from different RF sources, and so on), the RF
coverage adjusts to these variables and changes with them. Because these variables
change continuously, monitoring for the RF coverage and adjusting it periodically is
necessary.
2.2.14
Mobility Issues
One of the key elements of mobility in any network has to do with roaming. Roaming in
an enterprise 802.11 network can be described as when an 802.11 client changes its AP
association from one AP within an ESS (extended service set) to another AP within the
same ESS. Depending on the network features and conﬁguration, a lot may occur
between the clients, WLCs, and upstream hops in the network, but at the most basic level
it is simply a change of association.
When a wireless client authenticates and associates with an AP, the WLC of the AP
places an entry for that client in its client database. This entry includes the client MAC
and IP addresses, security context and associations, QoS context, WLAN and associated
AP. The WLC uses this information to forward frames and manage trafﬁc to and from
the wireless client. When the wireless client moves its association from one AP to
another, the WLC simply updates the client database with the new associated AP. If
necessary, a new security context and associations are established as well.

Figure 2.19 Layer 2 roam.
2.2.14.1
Layer 2 Roam
A Layer 2 roam occurs when a client roams from one AP and (re)associates to a new AP,
providing the same client subnet. In most cases, the foreign AP can be on the same WLC
as the home AP. This is a very simple roam because the WLC maintains a database with
all the information of the client. All upstream network components from the WLC are
unaffected by the client moving from home to foreign AP, as illustrated in Figure 2.19. In
instances when there are multiple WLCs connected to the same subnet, and therefore a
client can roam between WLCs but remain on the same subnet, mobility announce­
ments are passed between the related WLCs to pass client context information between
WLCs. This WLC then becomes the anchor WLC for that client.
2.2.14.2
Layer 3 Roam
In instances where the client roams between APs that are connected to different WLCs
and the WLC WLAN is connected to a different subnet, a Layer 3 roam is performed and
there is an update between the new WLC (foreign WLC) and the old WLC (anchor
WLC) mobility databases.
If this is the case, return trafﬁc to the client still goes through its originating anchor
WLC. The anchor WLC uses Ethernet over IP (EoIP) to forward the client trafﬁc to the
foreign WLC, to where the client has roamed. Trafﬁc from the roaming client is
forwarded out of the foreign WLC interface on which it resides; it is not tunnelled
back. The client MAC address for its default gateway remains the same, with the WLC
changing the MAC address to the local interface gateway MAC address when the client
trafﬁc is sent to the default gateway.

33
2 Indoor Wireless Technologies
Figure 2.20 Layer 3 roam.
The example in Figure 2.20 describes a client Layer 3 roam with PMK (pair-wise
master key). The client begins with a connection to AP B on WLC 1. This creates an
ANCHOR entry in the WLC client database. As the client moves away from AP B and
makes an association with AP C, WLC 2 sends a mobility announcement to peers in
the mobility group looking for the WLC with the client MAC address. WLC 1
responds to the announcement, handshakes and ACKs. Next the client database
entry for the roaming client is copied to WLC 2 and is marked as FOREIGN. Included
PMK data (master key data from the RADIUS server) are also copied to WLC 2. This
provides fast roam times for WPA2/802.11i clients because there is no need to
reauthenticate to the RADIUS server. After a simple key exchange between the client
and AP, the client is added to the WLC 2 database and is similar, except that it is
marked as FOREIGN.
2.3
Bluetooth
Bluetooth (IEEE 802.16 standard, 2015) is a technology employed for short-range
wireless communications, mainly in the ISM band around 2.4 GHz (same frequency
as Wi-Fi) from ﬁxed and mobile terminals, and building personal area networks (PANs).
The standard was developed by the telecom vendor Ericsson in the mid-1990s and was
originally conceived as a wireless alternative for RS-232 serial communications.

34
Indoor Wireless Communications
Bluetooth operates in the range of 2400-2483.5 MHz (including guard bands). This is
in the globally unlicensed (but not unregulated) industrial, scientiﬁc and medical (ISM)
2.4 GHz short-range radio frequency band. Bluetooth uses a radio technology called a
frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS), similar to that used in old IS-95 cellular
standards. The transmitted data are divided into packets and each packet is transmitted
on one of the 79 designated Bluetooth channels. Each channel has a bandwidth of 1 MHz.
Bluetooth 4.0 uses 2 MHz spacing, which allows for 40 channels. The ﬁrst channel
starts at 2402 MHz and continues up to 2480 MHz in 1 MHz steps. It usually performs
1600 hops per second, with adaptive frequency-hopping (AFH) enabled.
Originally, Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) modulation was the only modu­
lation scheme available; subsequently, since the introduction of Bluetooth 2.0+EDR,
π/4-DQPSK and 8-DPSK modulation may also be used between compatible devices.
Devices functioning with GFSK are said to be operating in basic rate (BR) mode where an
instantaneous data rate of 1 Mbit/s is possible.
Bluetooth is a packet-based protocol with a master-slave structure. One master may
communicate with up to seven slaves in a piconet (an ad hoc computer network using
Bluetooth technology); all devices share the master's clock. The devices can switch roles,
by agreement, and the slave can become the master (e.g. a headset initiating a connection
to a phone will necessarily begin as master, as initiator of the connection, but may
subsequently prefer to be slave).
Bluetooth is a standard wire-replacement communications protocol primarily
designed for low power consumption, with a short range based on low-cost transceiver
microchips in each device. Because the devices use a radio (broadcast) communications
system, they do not have to be in visual line of sight of each other; however, a quasi-
optical wireless path must be viable. Range is power-class-dependent, but effective
ranges vary in practice. For example, class 1 devices that transmit at 100 mW (20 dBm)
may reach up to 100 metres under clear propagation conditions (not cluttered environ­
ments). As discussed earlier in this chapter, obstructions may introduce additional losses
to the wireless link and hence reduce the range considerably.
There is a range of applications for which Bluetooth has been used, as follows:
 Wireless control of and communication between a mobile phone and a hands-free
headset. This was one of the earliest applications to become popular.
 Wireless control of and communication between a mobile phone and a Bluetooth
compatible car stereo system.
 Wireless control of and communication with tablets and speakers such as iPad and
Android devices.
 Wireless Bluetooth headset and Intercom. Idiomatically, a headset is sometimes called
'a Bluetooth'.
 Wireless networking between PCs in a conﬁned space and where little bandwidth is
required.
 Wireless communication with PC input and output devices, the most common being
the mouse, keyboard and printer.
 Transfer of ﬁles, contact details, calendar appointments and reminders between
devices with OBEX.
 Replacement of previous wired RS-232 serial communications in test equipment, GPS
receivers, medical equipment, bar code scanners and trafﬁc control devices.
 For controls where infrared was often used.

35
2 Indoor Wireless Technologies
 For low bandwidth applications where a higher USB bandwidth is not required and
cable-free connection is desired.
 Sending small advertisements from Bluetooth-enabled advertising hoardings to other,
discoverable, Bluetooth devices.
 Wireless bridge between two Industrial Ethernet (e.g. PROFINET) networks.
 Three seventh and eighth generation game consoles, Nintendo's Wii and Sony's
PlayStation 3, use Bluetooth for their respective wireless controllers.
 Dial-up Internet access on personal computers or PDAs using a data-capable mobile
phone as a wireless modem.
 Short-range transmission of health sensor data from medical devices to mobile phone,
set-top box or dedicated tele-health devices.
 Allowing a DECT phone to ring and answer calls on behalf of a nearby mobile phone.
 Real-time location systems (RTLSs) are used to track and identify the location of
objects in real-time using 'Nodes' or 'tags' attached to or embedded in the objects
tracked, and 'Readers' that receive and process the wireless signals from these tags to
determine their locations.
 Personal security application on mobile phones for prevention of theft or loss of items.
The protected item has a Bluetooth marker (e.g. a tag) that is in constant communi­
cation with the phone. If the connection is broken (the marker is out of range of the
phone) an alarm is raised. This can also be used as a crew overboard alarm. A product
using this technology has been available since 2009.
Many devices nowadays, especially for home, are provided with a Bluetooth connec­
tion. Various examples of Bluetooth devices or cards are shown in Figure 2.21. For a

2.4 ZigBee
ZigBee is a protocol (IEEE 802.15 standard, 2015) that has been created for personal area
networks (PANs) built from small, low-power digital radios. Even though the standard is
designed to operate at low power, larger distances can be achieved by passing data
through intermediate devices to reach more distant ones, thus creating a mesh network.
A mesh network is one with no centralized control or high-power transceiver able to
reach all the networked devices.
One of the characteristics of ZigBee is that it is mainly used to operate those
applications that require a low data rate, long battery life and secure networking -
ideal for industrial automation applications. The standard has a deﬁned rate of 250 kbps
and is best suited for periodic or intermittent data or single data transmission from a
sensor or input device. The low cost allows the technology to be widely deployed in
wireless control and monitoring applications. Low power usage allows longer life with
smaller batteries. Mesh networking provides high reliability and a more extensive range.
ZigBee chip vendors typically sell integrated radios and microcontrollers with a ﬂash
memory of between 60 kb and 256 kb.
Some typical applications that involve ZigBee include wireless light switches, electrical
metres with in-home displays, trafﬁc management systems and other consumer and
industrial equipment that require short-range wireless transfer of data at relatively low
rates. In summary:
 Home entertainment and control - home automation, smart lighting, advanced
temperature control, safety and security, movies and music
 Wireless sensor networks
 Industrial control
 Embedded sensing
 Medical data collection
 Smoke and intruder warning
 Building automation.
The technology deﬁned by the ZigBee speciﬁcation is intended to be simpler and less
expensive than other wireless personal area networks (WPANs), such as Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi. ZigBee is not intended to support powerline networking but to interface with it at
least for smart metering and smart appliance purposes. An example of a ZigBee module
is shown in Figure 2.22.
One key characteristic of ZigBee is its robust security. ZigBee networks are secured by
128 bit symmetric encryption keys. In home automation applications, transmission
distances range from 10 to 100 meters line-of-sight, depending on power output and
environmental characteristics.
ZigBee operates on the industrial, scientiﬁc and medical (ISM) radio bands: 868 MHz
in Europe, 915 MHz in the USA and Australia and 2.4 GHz in most jurisdictions
worldwide. Data transmission rates vary from 20 kilobits/second in the 868 MHz
frequency band to 250 kilobits/second in the 2.4 GHz frequency band.

Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID)
Radio frequency identiﬁcation, or RFID, is becoming extremely popular in logic
automation and in industry. Radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) is a generic term
for non-contacting technologies that use radio waves to automatically identify people or
objects. There are several methods of identiﬁcation, but the most common is to store a
unique serial number that identiﬁes a person or object on a microchip that is attached to
an antenna. The combined antenna and microchip is called an 'RFID transponder' or
'RFID tag' and works in combination with an 'RFID reader' (sometimes called an 'RFID
interrogator'). Examples of tags are given in Figure 2.23.

Figure 2.23 Examples of various RFID tags and readers.
An RFID system consists of a reader and one or more tags. The reader's antenna is
used to transmit radio frequency (RF) energy. Depending on the tag type, the energy is
'harvested' by the tag's antenna and used to power-up the internal circuitry of the tag.
The tag will then modulate the electromagnetic waves generated by the reader in order
to transmit data back to the reader. The reader receives the modulated waves and
converts them into digital data. This principle is called backscattering and is shown in
Figure 2.24.
There are two major types of tag technologies. Passive tags are tags that do not contain
their own power source or transmitter. When radio waves from the reader reach the
chip's antenna, the energy is converted by the antenna into electricity that can power-upFigure depicting backscattering principle used to power RFID passive systems.

the microchip in the tag (known as 'parasitic power'). The tag is then able to send back
any information stored on the tag by reﬂecting the electromagnetic waves as described
above. Active tags have their own power source and transmitter.
The power source, usually a battery, is used to run the microchip circuitry and to
broadcast a signal to a reader. Due to the fact that passive tags do not have their own
transmitter and must reﬂect their signal to the reader, the reading distance is much
shorter than with active tags. However, active tags are typically larger, more expensive
and require occasional service.
Frequency refers to the size of the radio waves used to communicate between the
RFID system components. Just as you tune your radio to different frequencies in order to
hear different radio stations, RFID tags and readers must be tuned to the same frequency
in order to communicate effectively. RFID systems typically use one of the following
frequency ranges: low frequency (or LF, around 125 kHz), high frequency (or HF, around
13.56 MHz), ultra-high frequency (or UHF, around 868 and 928 MHz) or microwave
(around 2.45 and 5.8 GHz).
There really is no such thing as a 'typical' RFID tag. The read range of a tag ultimately
depends on many factors: the frequency of RFID system operation, the power of the
reader, environmental conditions, physical size of the tag antenna and interference from
other RF devices.
2.6
Private Mobile Radio (PMR)
A private mobile radio (PMR) was developed for business users who need to keep in
contact over relatively short distances with a central base station, such as taxi companies
or emergency services. PMR networks consist of one or more base stations and a number
of mobile terminals, as depicted in Figure 2.25. Such a system serves a closed user group
that is normally owned and operated by the same organization as its users.
PMR systems use dedicated radio frequencies that are licensed by the regulator that
manages the radio spectrum for a country. This ensures that the radio frequencies are
available for the sole use of the PMR system and that other radios in the same frequency
band do not interfere with the operation of the system.
Figure 2.25 Private mobile radio.

40
Indoor Wireless Communications
From their early designs, PMR systems have developed into 'trunked' systems, the
most notable of which is TETRA, a terrestrial trunked radio. Trunking is a technique
where the resources of the communications network are shared, thus providing both
ﬂexibility and economy in the allocation of network resources. Typically, a communi­
cation channel is allocated for the duration of a call and then automatically released to
allow it to be used for another call, perhaps between different users on the same system.
The technique also enables multiple base stations to be connected and to provide
coverage across a wider area than with a single base station.
PMR systems generally provide facilities for closed user groups, group call and push­
to-talk, and have call setup times that are generally short compared with cellular systems.
Many PMR systems allow direct mode operation in which terminals can communicate
with one another directly when they are out of the coverage area of a network.
PMR systems may also be developed to allow public access (by subscription) and they
are then known as a public access mobile radio (PAMR). The users of PAMR systems are
usually not the same as the system's owner and operator. Traditionally, PMR systems
have usually been based on European standards for the equipment, but operated under
licence and subject to national frequency management plans. An exception is PMR 446,
a consumer 'walkie-talkie, which has six analogue channels allocated in most European
countries for use without a licence.
2.6.1
PMR Elements
PMR systems consist of two main elements - infrastructure and terminals. Infra­
structure is provided by one or more radio base stations or repeaters which can be
deployed on a single site or dispersed over a large geographical area to provide coverage
over a wide area. Terminals usually refer to the hand portables carried by users or the
mobile radios commonly installed into vehicles, but can also include applications such as
voice and data dispatching.
2.6.2
Attributes
Some of the key attributes of PMR systems are:
 Coverage. A PMR system is designed to provide coverage for the entire operational
environment so that radio signals are transmitted to all of the locations when
communications are required by the customer. In addition to outside locations,
this may include in-building coverage and underground locations such as tunnels.
 Group communications. Business operations quite often rely on group calls to
facilitate efﬁcient operational communications. A simple example of this can be
provided by security staff in large sporting stadiums, where a member of staff can call
for assistance from a number of colleagues by making a group call using a single button
press.
 Reliability and resilience. PMR systems are often the ﬁrst choice for communica­
tions where safety is paramount. This is why the public safety services of police, ﬁre
and ambulance use PMR as their primary means of voice communications. Due to the
requirements of these organizations that the systems they use are ultimately reliable,
PMR systems are often designed to continue to provide a service in the event of

41
2 Indoor Wireless Technologies
equipment or power failure through the use of intelligent recovery mechanisms and
power backup using batteries and/or generators.
 Performance. PMR systems use efﬁcient signalling protocols to ensure very quick call
establishment times. Often user organizations have requirements to be able to start
speaking almost as soon as they decide to make a call and cannot wait for someone to
answer a phone. For this reason, PMR systems provide a large range of call types from
open channel calls where the user can quickly press and talk to emergency calls, which
will always get through no matter how busy the system is.
 Contention. The size of a PMR system can be designed to deliver the quality of service
required by the users. For non-essential communications it might be acceptable for
users to queue or wait until resources are available and can therefore use a small
system, but for higher end-users the system can be designed with a large amount of
capacity to ensure that calls are always completed regardless of how busy the system
becomes.
 Security. Privacy of communications can be very important to organizations to ensure
that their conversations do remain private. PMR systems are able to offer varying levels
of security from basic voice scrambling right up to complex military-grade encryption
algorithms depending upon the needs of the encryption.
2.6.3
TETRA
A terrestrial trunked radio (TETRA) is a digital trunked mobile radio standard developed
to meet the needs of traditional PMR user organizations such as: public safety,
transportation, utilities, government, police forces, ﬁre departments, ambulance, rail
transport staff for train radios, transport services and the military. TETRA is a European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) standard and its ﬁrst version was
published 1995; it is mentioned by the European Radiocommunications Committee
(ERC). An example of vehicle and portable TETRA radios is illustrated in Figure 2.26.
TETRA uses time division multiple access (TDMA) with four user channels on one
radio carrier and 25 kHz spacing between carriers. Both point-to-point and point-to­
multipoint transfer can be used. Digital data transmission is also included in the standard
at a low data rate.
In terms of architecture, TETRA mobile stations (MS) can communicate using either
direct-mode operation (DMO) or trunked-mode operation (TMO), employing
Photog raph s dep icting  TET RA radios for : ( a) vehicle and (b) portable.

42
Indoor Wireless Communications
switching and management infrastructure (SwMI) made of TETRA base stations (TBS).
One of the advantages of using DMO is that it allows direct communications when
network coverage is not available, using other TETRA terminals as relays - this is due to
the very strict network reliability that TETRA needs to have. The base stations normally
transmit continuously and (simultaneously) receive continuously from various mobiles
on different carrier frequencies; hence the TETRA system is an FDD system. TETRA
also uses FDMA/TDMA, similar to GSM.
TETRA also supports data communications, to send short messages over the system's
control channels, whereas speciﬁc assigned channels are employed for packet-switched
or circuit-switched data. For its modulation, TETRA uses π/4 DQPSK, a form of phase
shift keying. The symbol (baud) rate is 18 000 symbols per second and each symbol maps
to 2 bits, thus resulting in 36 000 bits/s gross.
Since TETRA needs to be well protected against eavesdropping, it is equipped with air
interface encryption algorithms, which make it very robust.
The common mode of operation is in a group calling mode in which a single button
push will connect the user to the users in a selected call group and/or a dispatcher. It is
also possible for the terminal to act as a one-to-one 'walkie talkie', but without the
normal range limitation since the call still uses the network. TETRA terminals can act
as mobile phones, with a full-duplex direct connection to other TETRA users or the
PSTN. Emergency buttons, provided on the terminals, enable the users to transmit
emergency signals to the dispatcher, overriding any other activity taking place at the
same time.
Although the allocated frequency band for TETRA is around 400 MHz, some
countries employ slightly different channels for emergency and/or civilian use. For
example,
in
France,
410-430 MHz
is
allocated
for
civilian/private
use,
with
380-400 MHz for emergency services. In Italy, the armed forces/emergency services
employ the frequency pair 380-390 MHz and 462 MHz for civilian/private usage.
Finally, the TETRA Association, working with ETSI, developed the TEDS standard, a
wideband data solution, which enhances TETRA with a much higher capacity and
throughput for data. In addition to those provided by TETRA, TEDS uses a range of
adaptive modulation schemes and a number of different carrier sizes from 25 kHz to
150 kHz, thus employing a similar strategy to the adaptive modulation schemes deﬁned
in cellular LTE. Initial implementations of TEDS will be in the existing TETRA radio
spectrum and is likely to employ 50 kHz channel bandwidths as this enables an
equivalent coverage footprint for voice and TEDS services. TEDS performance is
optimized for wideband data rates, wide area coverage and spectrum efﬁciency.
2.7 Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT)
Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT
TM) is the ETSI standard for
short-range cordless communications, which can be adapted for many applications and
can be used over unlicensed frequency allocations world-wide. Although it was initially
developed as a European standard, it was later adopted by many other countries (more
than 110) and today has become a world-wide de-facto standard for cordless telephony
applications. The standard is also used in electronic cash terminals, trafﬁc lights and
remote door openers.

43
2 Indoor Wireless Technologies
The most common spectrum allocation is 1.88 GHz to 1.9 GHz used in Europe. This
spectrum is unlicensed and technology exclusive, which ensures the operation of the
standard with practically no interference, thus contributing to the very high spectral
efﬁciency of the technology. The bands 1.9 GHz to 1.92 GHz and 1.91 GHz to 1.93 GHz
are also very common in many countries outside Europe. In the United States the
frequency allocation is 1920-1930 MHz, known as the UPCS band. In this case, the
allocation is not technology exclusive, but is, in practice, safe enough to achieve similar
interference-free operation.
Moreover, frequency allocations in Europe of 1.9-1.92 GHz (shared with UTRAN
TDD), 1.92-1.98 GHz (shared with the uplink of UTRAN FDD) and 2.01-2.025 GHz
have been foreseen by IMT-2000 for potential expansion of the standard, but actually
they are not used yet.
DECT is suited to voice (including PSTN and VoIP telephony), data and networking
applications with a range up to 500 metres. It dominates the cordless residential market
and the enterprise PABX (private automatic branch exchange) market. DECT is also used
in the wireless local loop (WLL) to replace copper in the 'last mile' for user premises.
DECT operates in the 1880-1900 MHz band and deﬁnes ten channels from
1881.792 MHz to 1897.344 MHz with a band guard of 1728 kHz. Each base station
frame provides twelve duplex speech channels, with each time slot occupying any
channel. The standard operates in the multicarrier/TDMA/TDD structure. DECT also
provides a frequency-hopping spread spectrum over the TDMA/TDD structure. If
frequency-hopping is avoided, each base station can provide up to 120 channels in the
DECT spectrum before frequency reuse. Each timeslot can be assigned to a different
channel in order to exploit advantages of frequency hopping and to avoid interference
from other users in an asynchronous fashion.
The main technical characteristics of DECT include (European Telecommunications
Standards Institute, 2015):

System Requirements
An indoor wireless system is based on a set of requirements that should be met if the
system is to deliver the required quality-of-service (QoS) for each of the offered services.
These requirements, for example, could be speciﬁed in signal strength or path loss levels
above or below a certain threshold, at various places inside and outside the building,
which are taken as targets at which the design should aim for. The deﬁnition of such
requirements is strongly related to the type of technology that is being deployed in the
building and also depends on speciﬁc facility needs.
This chapter describes the deﬁnition of such requirements in a general context for any
wireless communication system. Speciﬁc requirements depending on technology may
vary and differences will be highlighted and explained.
3.1
Environments
The mobile propagation channel is particularly characterized by a strong inﬂuence of
surrounding clutter and objects around transmitters and receivers in a wireless system.
These obstructions mainly determine the way in which the signal propagates along a
speciﬁc path, and therefore should not be underestimated. Furthermore, indoor sce­
narios have stronger effects as they are more densely populated by clutter, walls and
partitions of different materials and open spaces such as windows, doors and atriums.
Thus, it is very important to identify the characteristics of such obstructions and their
distribution, in order to account for these changes and variations in ﬁeld strength.
Indeed, indoor wireless design is very building-speciﬁc; that is each building has
unique characteristics that make radio propagation different, and therefore the expected
performance of the system varies. Radio propagation determines to a great extent the
characteristics of the wireless system that will be deployed in terms of coverage,
interference and leakage, but there are other performance requirements that can also
be affected by the type of buildings and facilities, such as capacity, or the number of
wireless resources/channels required to satisfy users' demands.
Despite this, it is possible to make a classiﬁcation of buildings based on the type of
facility the design is aimed for, and therefore premises can be categorized based on this
criterion. For our purpose, these categories are to be called environments, and buildings
that can fall within each category will be explained in each particular section. At this
stage, it is important to point out that this classiﬁcation is mainly based on the speciﬁc

building characteristics that affect radio requirements and therefore make a type of
building fall within one or another category.
3.1.1
Corporate Buildings
Corporate buildings are facilities that are normally used by enterprises to have their
headquarters or branches across a country. They include ofﬁces, meeting rooms,
lounges, warehouses and, for very speciﬁc ﬁrms, labs and leisure venues. They vary
in size from single-ﬂoor to multistorey buildings, as well as in land extension. Figure 3.1
shows examples of these buildings.
Corporate buildings often have multiple ﬂoors, which make the need to provide
coverage in upper and lower ﬂoors using the minimum number of resources, to
minimize cost. There are also radio propagation characteristics associated with multiple
ﬂoors that need to be taken into account for leakage outside the building as well as
penetration from outdoor wireless systems.
In some cases, a uniform layout of ﬂoors can be observed in many types of corporate
buildings, which facilitates the design of the wireless coverage solution as propagation
effects can be assumed to be the same for similar ﬂoors. This is normally done in the
design of cellular systems, especially for building towers having a dozen ﬂoors.
Corporate building blocks are normally made of a wide variety of materials, but in
most cases it is concrete and brick for the external walls and plasterboard and similar
construction materials for the indoor partitions. Metallized windows, which do not allow
macrocell penetration inside the building, are also common; this has the beneﬁt ofPhotographs depicting corporate buildings for various enterprises as a variety of architectural designs.

providing better levels of isolation between the indoor and the outdoor systems, as it is
the case for cellular networks (Tolstrup, 2011). Nevertheless, leakage levels should be
carefully controlled outside the building, for security reasons.
Some modern buildings exhibit a peculiar architecture, being surrounded by windows
and for which the area dedicated to walls tends to be quite reduced, as shown in
Figure 3.2. Most of these windows are made of materials that attenuate the radio signal
strength and hence provide some form of 'isolation'. However, this is not the case for all
scenarios and there are occasions in which isolation is very hard to achieve between an
indoor dedicated cell and an outdoor cell. We will examine various techniques and
methods later on in this book to account for these issues.
It is common for many wireless services to coexist in corporate buildings, for example
wireless local area networks, cellular services, VMTS, VoWLAN, mobile computing,
paging, two-way radio and ﬁre/life/safety systems. Also, it has been a recent tendency for
some companies to prefer mobile phone usage rather than ﬁxed telephone lines amongst
their employees. Thus, high wireless connectivity to enhance staff productivity is
pursued, with the use of many wireless devices (laptop, PDAs, mobile phones, wireless
printers, etc.). This has also pushed wireless network providers and operators to offer
attractive cost tariffs for enterprises willing to replace the use of ﬁxed telephone lines by
mobile telephones.
3.1.2
Airports
An airport is a location where aircraft, such as commercial and private airplanes,
helicopters and airships (free-ﬂying aircrafts such as a Zeppelin) take off and land,
according to modern deﬁnitions. Throughout the years, airport design and layout has
evolved drastically, providing more comfort and facilities to airport staff and passengers.

48
Indoor Wireless Communications
Figure 3.3 Airports are large and busy facilities with a large variety of spaces that are relevant to wireless
coverage: (a) airport access; (b) departures hall in the terminal building; (c) baggage reclaim area;
(d) airport piers; (e) arrivals hall; (f) transfer and waiting rooms.
This includes wireless connectivity and access to the Internet, 'wherever you are and
whenever you want'. It is therefore not surprising that an airport is one of the most
important ports of entry for wireless operators and service providers, and thus special
care should be taken when providing indoor wireless coverage there.
Although airports across the world vary in size and passenger trafﬁc, most consist of
runways, hangars and terminal buildings, as illustrated in Figure 3.3. Architecture and

49
3 System Requirements
style is also very varied across the world, ranging from very simple one-terminal small
airports to very large facilities, with many terminals and multistorey buildings, tunnels
and even underground stations inside the airport. Large airports have also included
dedicated areas for passengers, such as: restaurant and cafe areas, VIP rooms, waiting
lounges, casinos, duty-free shops, hotels, etc.
Airports are mainly characterized for being highly changeable environments, where
entire areas and zones are often refurbished and/or removed to relocate lounges, shops
or open areas. This is especially applicable to large airports, such as Heathrow in London,
UK; Charles de Gaulle in Paris, France; Schiphol in Amsterdam, Netherlands; Tokyo
International in Tokyo, Japan; O'Hare International in Chicago, IL, USA; Hartsﬁeld-
Jackson in Atlanta, GA, USA; just to mention some of the busiest airports in the world.
Wireless coverage inside airports is a very important issue for operators, service
providers, airport owners and authorities. Many passengers use the airport every day
with various speciﬁc demands for wireless services, which span from getting in touch
with friends and family; downloading music or video streams while waiting for their
ﬂight to depart or someone to arrive; working remotely and connecting their mobile
devices to remote servers and accessing the Internet; and downloading and uploading
emails. In addition to this, airport staff also make use of wireless services, such as: private
mobile radio (PMR) and emergency services, and radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID)
for baggage handling and tagging, amongst others. The fact that many wireless
technologies are thus present within the airport imposes a further challenge for indoor
wireless designers, since interference needs to be minimized and, in some cases,
infrastructure should be reused whenever possible, which makes multioperator and
multitechnology solutions more widespread nowadays; for example, many cellular
operators sharing the same distribution system, Wi-Fi and cellular sharing antennas,
etc. Interoperability should be guaranteed amongst the various wireless technologies
(cellular, radar, public safety, PMR, Wi-Fi, etc.)
Airport terminal buildings have a large variety of spaces and areas where coverage is
required, as described above; these places are normally referred to as hot spots since
trafﬁc is more likely to congregate there. Examples of this include all waiting lounges,
food court, immigration, arrivals and departures halls. The characteristics of some
airport terminal buildings, which include open spaces and large atriums, make propa­
gation predictions challenging.
In particular, airport piers are a special case for indoor wireless design, since they are
normally long corridors for which waveguiding effects (which will be addressed in detail
in Chapter 4) are observed (Saunders and Aragón-Zavala, 2007), similar to those seen in
tunnels. Not only are propagation characteristics peculiar here but also bursty trafﬁc is
observed, since passengers arrive in bursts. More speciﬁcally, for cellular systems,
arriving passengers normally switch on their mobile phones as soon as they land and
operators are keen to catch as many roamers as possible by having the best signal
strength and quality in the airport piers.
To provide cellular coverage to airports, a common technique is to rely on macrocell
penetration from surrounding outdoor base stations (Tolstrup, 2011), especially if
airport size and trafﬁc is reasonably small. If this technique is used, special care should
be taken to assess coverage levels inside and outside the airport to control handovers
efﬁciently, especially for cellular 3G networks where soft handover could make excessive
use of resources if handover limits are not carefully chosen and controlled. For larger

50
Indoor Wireless Communications
airports with higher trafﬁc demands, dedicated picocells are often employed. For other
wireless technologies, dedicated base stations are used. Optical ﬁbre links are also widely
used for data networking inside airports, and sometimes radio-over-ﬁbre technologies
are used to transport radio signals over long distances, using the existing ﬁbre
infrastructure.
In addition to terminal buildings and piers, wireless coverage is also required in car
parks and surrounding areas and locations near the airport, as passengers and airport
users require seamless coverage for personal and professional use. This includes
emergency and safety systems, for which very high reliability is needed.
In terms of capacity dimensioning, various trafﬁc user proﬁles are present in an airport
for which various trafﬁc demands can be identiﬁed: arriving passengers, departing
passengers, visitors, airport staff, on-transit passengers (Aragón-Zavala et al., 2009). This
implies special techniques for capacity dimensioning, which also depend on the areas
where people are more likely to congregate, and thus network resources need to be
distributed accordingly. Moreover, broadband demands in airport hot spots make data
trafﬁc so high that nowadays it is common to perform data ofﬂoading to other wireless
networks such as Wi-Fi, to avoid congestion on 3G and LTE networks.
Finally, the exclusion of wireless coverage in runways for safety reasons has been a
topic for debate for a long time. Since it is claimed that wireless coverage should be
avoided on the runways to minimize interference with aircraft electronic navigation
equipment, airport authorities are pushing to ban wireless coverage in these areas. On
the other hand, some operators argue that coverage is desired as soon as the aircraft
lands and it is there inside the aircraft and even before getting off the plane where
passengers switch on their mobiles phones - a fair amount of roamers can be caught here
with proper cellular coverage design!
3.1.3
Trains and Railway Stations
A railway station is a train facility where trains regularly stop to load or unload
passengers or freight, such as the ones shown in Figure 3.4. It consists of a platform
next to the tracks and a building providing related services such as ticket sales andPhotographs depicting examples of railway stations: (a) terminus; (b) halt.
Figure 3.4 Examples of railway stations: (a) terminus; (b) halt.

51
3 System Requirements
waiting rooms. Connections may be available to intersecting rail lines or other transport
modes such as buses or the underground (tube).
In European countries, trains are one of the most popular choices for passengers
travelling from their homes to their workplaces (commuters) or tourists travelling from
one city to another, sometimes in different countries. In most of the world, cargo trains
are employed to transport a wide variety of items. Either way, train stations have speciﬁc
needs for wireless coverage. For instance, terminus and halts (small stations) need a
different design approach, since they vary in size and passenger demands; waiting rooms
and lounges may require sufﬁcient coverage for wireless Internet services for passengers;
coverage is desired in both terminals and platforms; and hot spots of trafﬁc for large
stations are also identiﬁed, which need to be properly addressed. Modern trains offer on­
board wireless connectivity, which allows passengers to access Internet and other
broadband services on the move. The main challenge here is not only the provision
of coverage inside the train, but the backhaul connection to another network that
guarantees a reliable connectivity during the entire journey.
As far as radio propagation is concerned, train stations are commonly ancient
buildings, with thick wall materials that produce high propagation losses. More modern
stations are made of less-attenuating materials, which allow a signal to propagate better.
Underground platforms are a challenge since radio signals cannot penetrate walls to
reach these areas and therefore dedicated base stations are required. Large open spaces
and atriums also make train stations a challenging environment for accurate propagation
predictions. In terms of propagation along the train coaches, this is normally conﬁned to
multiple reﬂections and some absorption in the seating areas.
In recent times, the provision of coverage on board trains has become more popular,
giving commuters the facility to have wireless connectivity whilst travelling to work or
coming back home. Most rail companies in Europe provide this service to their
customers and thus special requirements should be speciﬁed for on-board passengers,
some of which may clearly differ if at the terminal. Figure 3.5 shows an example of the
interior of a European train coach.Photograph depicting train coach for which on-board coverage is provided.

Shopping Centres
Since the development of suburban shopping centres in the United States in the 1950s,
shopping malls have become the most popular type of retail venues throughout the
world. The ﬁrst malls were open as air retail centres, but very quickly a need to shelter
shops and customers from the elements was recognized, and the concept of an enclosed
shopping centre was born. An example of a contemporary shopping mall is shown in
Figure 3.6.
A shopping centre or mall is one or more buildings forming a complex of shops
representing merchandisers, with interconnecting walkways enabling visitors to easily
walk from unit to unit, along with a car park area, as seen in Figure 3.7.
Some shopping malls have large exterior windows that provide plenty of natural light.
For malls that have solid external walls, it is a glass-covered opening in the roof also
known as a soonroof that provides the natural light. Some shopping malls have a
multilevel parking structure attached to it. However, most malls only have an open
air surface carpark next to the mall that provides no cover from the elements. Inside an
enclosed mall, small retail shops are lined against the perimeter while leaving the middle
area open to pedestrian trafﬁc. An example of this 'open ﬂoor plan' interior mall
architecture is shown in Figure 3.8.
There is not a great deal of difference in terms of construction materials and building
layout of a shopping centre and other public facilities such as airport terminal buildingsPhotograph depicting the examples of shopping centres: (a) modern mall; (b) marketplace.

or train stations. Perhaps one of the most distinctive features of a shopping centre is the
fact that requirements can be drastically different to those for airports or train stations.
For example, some areas and shops in the mall may have restricted access and even
coverage should be kept to a minimum level. Antennas should be hid as much as possible
and aesthetics becomes a high priority. Special large chain stores (departmental stores)
may have speciﬁc coverage requirements for their customers, offering a range of wireless
services inside their stores. A food court is especially important for the deployment of
various wireless services to customers, with different user proﬁles and characteristics to
those of airport or train passengers.
Maybe it is worth mentioning that there are a couple of characteristics that should not
be overseen for shopping centres. Modern malls are multistorey buildings, having large
atriums and open spaces combined with small rooms, where the shops are located, and at
least a couple of large spaces per ﬂoor for departmental stores.
Car par coverage is especially of relevance, and in most of the cases it is quite difﬁcult
to achieve if dedicated base stations or antennas are not used, as car parks are often found
in underground locations. Multistorey car parks can also be found, for which case
wireless coverage is often achieved by surrounding outdoor base stations.
3.1.5
Hospitals
A hospital is an institution for health care providing patient treatment by specialized staff
and equipment, and often, but not always, providing for longer-term patient stays. This
deﬁnition has evolved over the years, as in ancient times a hospital was 'a place for
hospitality'.
Modern hospital buildings are designed to minimize the effort of medical personnel
and the possibility of contamination while maximizing the efﬁciency of the whole
system. Travel time for personnel within the hospital and the transportation of patients
between units is facilitated and minimized. The building also should be built to

54
Indoor Wireless Communications
accommodate heavy departments such as radiology and operating rooms while space for
special wiring, plumbing and waste disposal must be allowed for in the design.
Although these characteristics are desired for most hospitals, the reality is that many
hospitals are the product of continual and often badly managed growth over decades or
even centuries, with utilitarian new sections added on as needs and ﬁnances dictate. This
obviously has an impact on wireless systems design and dimensioning, often pushing the
wireless infrastructure to the limit to accommodate these new additions.
Hospitals have distinctive areas with different coverage requirements, which are
summarized here:
 Isolation areas may be required for some critical zones, especially those containing
specialized medical electronic equipment.
 Patient rooms and wards, where visitors are welcome, should have sufﬁcient coverage
to allow patients and family to communicate effectively.
 Interference is a major concern for hospitals and good isolation is a high priority.
In terms of equipment, short-range wireless devices using technologies such as
Bluetooth may be used to interconnect devices in patients to monitor vital signs and
other variables. They can also be used for interconnectivity between caregivers,
consultants, specialists and hospital staff within the facility.
An important factor that should not be underestimated is that of scalability, to
activate new wireless services quickly and extend services to new buildings is needed,
including a high-mobility proﬁle for users and caregivers, with a wireless services
portfolio wherever they go.
Hospitals are made of a variety of building materials, basically depending of the
speciﬁc architecture and style; for example, there is a clear difference in construction
materials between a modern hospital building and an ancient facility. For the former,
plasterboard and concrete walls are often employed and in some cases brick walls are
used in various areas of the hospital. Multistorey hospital buildings are commonly found,
with ﬂoors having a very similar layout. On the other hand, for the latter, old buildings
are made of stone and high loss materials, with very thick walls and not many windows or
doors allowing signals to penetrate the building.
3.1.6
Arenas and Stadiums
An arena is an enclosed area, often circular or oval-shaped, designed to showcase
theatre, musical performances or sporting events. It is composed of a large open space
surrounded on most or all sides by tiered seating for spectators. The key feature of an
arena is that the event space is the lowest point, allowing for maximum visibility. Usually,
an arena is designed to accommodate a fairly large number of spectators, as shown in
Figure 3.9(a).
A stadium is a place, or venue, for mostly outdoor sports, concerts or other events,
consisting of a ﬁeld or stage partly or completely surrounded by a structure designed to
allow spectators to stand or sit and view the event. See Figure 3.9(b) for an example of a
football stadium.
Sports such as ice hockey, basketball, volleyball, gymnastics, boxing or martial arts are
normally played in an arena; other sports such as football, baseball, rugby or cricket are
played in a stadium. Music concerts and other events can take place in either venue.

55
3 System RequirementsPhotograph depicting the two types of sports venue: (a) sports arena; (b) football stadium.
Figure 3.9 Two types of sports venue: (a) sports arena; (b) football stadium.
For both cases, trafﬁc is limited to the schedule of the events that will take place in the
venue; otherwise it is rarely used at its full capacity. For example, in the early days of
cellular systems, it was not rare to see deployments of temporary cellular sites in
stadiums, to account for the very high peaks in trafﬁc that could overload the serving
macrocells. This strategy is still in use nowadays in many parts of the world, although
others have decided to have dedicated coverage and resources at all times.
Stadiums are characterized by having very large open spaces, which could even be
classiﬁed as outdoor and therefore arguably a stadium could be treated as an indoor
venue. However, due to the nature of the construction, behind the spectators' area, there
are areas in which people congregate in half-term periods or before the match starts,
which are indeed part of a building and therefore indoor propagation principles apply. In
the worst case scenario, wireless coverage to the spectators' area and seating can be
classiﬁed as leakage from the inside part of the stadium. Finally, heavy concrete and steel
construction used to build the facility produces high radio signals loss and therefore
antennas should be carefully placed to guarantee sufﬁcient coverage in all areas.
Arenas have clearly differences in terms of propagation characteristics to stadiums.
First, arenas are enclosed spaces with a similar layout for spectators' areas, surrounding the
large open space where events take place. Reﬂections can occur in the ceiling and therefore
radio signals propagate better. Second, arenas are normally smaller than stadiums, and
therefore less power is required from a base station to provide sufﬁcient coverage.
User proﬁles in stadiums and arenas are quite distinctive from the other indoor venues
we have discussed so far. A spectator will normally be paying close attention to the event
rather than using his or her wireless device for long periods of time. However, there
might be occasions in which a replay of the last minute event in the match may be
required, or getting in touch with someone else to inform what the score is can be a
priority. Also, users are not mobile most of the time, except for those times where people
can go for a break in the event or to restrooms. The major issue here is to do with the very
high volume of users needing to access network resources at the same time. Hence, there
is a strong requirement for careful and efﬁcient capacity dimensioning.
For arenas and stadiums, there is a need for Wi-Fi coverage for staff interconnectivity
and wireless distribution for a multicast system providing supporters with a unique
multimedia service for live game replays, highlights and statistics. Thus, multiple
wireless voice and data operators and services are required.

56
Indoor Wireless Communications
Due to the fairly large distances inside these venues, a distribution system capable of
accounting for large distances should be employed to distribute the signals inside the
building appropriately. This should be a discrete, robust and durable system.
3.1.6.1
What Makes a Stadium so Special?
Stadiums are venues that, unlike other in-building scenarios, have particular special
needs and challenges that any design engineer should know and understand in order to
create a suitable design. The following aims at presenting an overview of what these
challenges are that make a stadium 'so special'.
3.1.6.2
Mix of Communities with Different Needs
People with different backgrounds, interests, expectations, duties, etc., form the com­
munity in a stadium that has a need to have sufﬁcient wireless connectivity and quality­
of-service. However, the way 'sufﬁcient' is achieved may vary signiﬁcantly from one type
of user to another, in various dimensions such as: coverage area, connection speed,
service availability, grade of service necessities, etc. A few examples are now given to
illustrate this better.
 Visitors come to the stadium for either an event, a match or simply as tourists
wandering around the stadium. They normally make use of seating area spaces or, in
the case of concerts, use of the playﬁeld. During half time periods or breaks, they might
access food and hospitality areas, bars and toilets. Often, some of them may want to
share the latest goal with their friends or relatives who could not go to the stadium, and
make use of their mobile devices to send streaming data, pictures or SMSs. VIP visitors
have designated areas in rooms that have to be covered, as it is a 'very important area to
be covered'. Finally, some visitors may want to get access to the Internet while in the
stadium, so sufﬁcient coverage and capacity should be available for this. Not only voice
but also heavy data usage is anticipated for mostly all types of visitors coming to the
stadium.
 Stadium operations refer to the personnel who work for the stadium on a daily
basis, needing to have coverage and connectivity especially inside their ofﬁces. While
people in front of desks may require Internet connection and perhaps cellular
coverage, those who work for maintenance may need to have their PMR service, and
perhaps security guards may need to have coverage in larger areas than those for the
other personnel.
 Event personnel refers to the people who work for the speciﬁc event that is taking
place at the stadium. For example, if it is a football match, the players may need
coverage and connectivity in the dressing rooms, located normally in the basement.
On the other hand, coaches and managers need coverage in the playﬁeld, as well as the
referees. If it is a music concert, the coverage requirements change drastically, and it
might be that the bowl is the most important area for which coverage should be
guaranteed.
 Press and media clearly require a press and conference room with enough coverage
and capacity for press conferences, as well as connectivity in the playﬁeld to cover the
event. Heavy data usage is expected here, as well as voice.
 Security refers to police services that patrol the event, having strict coverage
requirements with high service availability. An example of this is TETRA in Europe,

57
3 System Requirements
a private network used by the police. The areas where coverage is needed for security
include even the most unexpected spaces in the stadium.
 Health and emergency services also require strict coverage requirements to meet
their speciﬁc demands, especially in the event of an emergency.
Stadiums are challenging venues for which special radio design techniques are
required. First of all, a mix of playﬁeld area along with the seating and concession
areas represent challenging environments for the prediction of radio waves. Inclined
surfaces on these areas have special effects on the way radio signals propagate at different
frequencies, and for which innovative models are required. In addition, stadium
materials also make the penetration of signals difﬁcult, and since there is a large mix
of these materials in the venue, propagation mechanisms are expected to behave
differently in each area - corridors, open space areas, enclosed spaces surrounded by
heavy penetration loss walls, etc. Heavy duty construction, for example ﬁre-resistant
stairwells, numerous lift shafts, mix of very old and brand new buildings, and different
radio requirements for non-event and event days, for example crowd management
radios, are examples of other construction challenges that have an effect on radio design.
Structural and architectural features, which make stadiums so special and distinct, also
represent challenges in order to predict radio waves. Trade-offs between coverage in
designated areas (e.g. sectors) and signal spillage to neighbouring ones (leakage) have to
be made. In summary, demanding coverage requirements in areas such as VIP rooms,
basement (dressing rooms) and car parks also require accurate radio planning and
modelling, in order to create both a cost-effective and working solution.
There is a very relevant aspect that should not be overseen: interference. Around the
stadium, surrounding macrocells provide cellular coverage and some of this signal
penetrates into the premises. If interference management is not considered, a degrada­
tion in the signal quality is expected, which will be much more critical for 3G systems. On
the other hand, interference between wireless technologies should also be taken into
account. Thus, these interference issues should be considered and resolved, especially
for broadcasters using wireless microphones, for example, of Wi-Fi networks operating
in the stadium. The breadth of different systems and requirements to be deployed makes
stadiums particularly very special venues in terms of radio considerations.
Finally, a large variety of wireless technologies and systems is often deployed in a
stadium, such as cellular, broadcasting, Wi-Fi. TETRA, etc., all with different require­
ments and that have to coexist and minimize interference amongst them. Site sharing is a
common practice for some stadiums, which must have special considerations. On the
business side, if the radio coverage is not satisfactory according to acceptance criteria for
some entities, especially security and emergency services, the opening and operation of
the stadium can be severely compromised.
3.1.7
University Campuses
Medium to large university campuses often have multiple buildings that are somehow
interconnected for different purposes. Perhaps one of the most common types of
connectivity is for Wi-Fi, where highly directional antennas are used as bridges to
communicate two campus buildings. Wireless coverage is therefore highly demanded in
many spaces and areas around the campus, as depicted in Figure 3.10.

58
Indoor Wireless Communications
Figure 3.10 University campus areas where wireless coverage is often required: (a) classrooms;
(b) conference rooms; (c) administrative ofﬁces; (d) labs; (e) computer rooms; (f) library.
Universities are characterized by a high variability of building layouts, structures and
materials, thus having multiple propagation scenarios that need to be accounted for. For
ancient universities, historic concrete structures are typically found, normally having
thick walls. More modern universities use less attenuating materials and radio signals
can penetrate much better.
It is often a requirement to allow coverage inside and outside university campus
buildings for students, visitors and staff to access wireless services in the vicinity of the
campus and be able to handover to dedicated cells (if it is the case) while inside the
campus. Wireless coverage is desired in classrooms, labs, faculty ofﬁces, restaurants,
dormitories and in outdoor areas inside the campus.
On the other hand, in many universities there are joint university-wireless providers'
educational projects, where wireless devices can be used as part of university courses to
assist students in their lectures and assignments. This fact, in conjunction with heavy data

59
3 System Requirements
usage and high mobility, produce higher data rate demands (growing bandwidth require­
ments) with newer challenges in terms of quality-of-service to maintain those services.
Finally, university authorities normally ask wireless operators to provide mobile
services without impacting the visual or historical integrity of the environment,
something that has a great impact of the choice of antennas, distribution systems
and system architectures.
3.1.8
Underground Stations
Train and underground stations have similar layouts: train platforms and a terminal
building where tickets are issued, including waiting rooms, shops and restaurants.
However, there is a major difference: for train stations, platforms are normally located at
the same ground level as the terminal building, whereas for underground stations,
platforms are always in tunnels well below the ground, as seen in Figure 3.11.
Underground tunnels exhibit very peculiar propagation behaviour and sometimes
signal strength predictions using mathematical models can be challenging (Saunders and
Aragón-Zavala, 2007). In addition, external base station penetration is very difﬁcult and
dedicated transmitters should be used to provide sufﬁcient coverage, as is the case for
cellular systems. For other technologies this is not such a problem as base stations are
often located in close proximity to users; for example Wi-Fi access points.
Trafﬁc behaviour tends to be bursty in the platforms, as it also is the case of train
stations. There is a major constraint for the provision of wireless coverage in the
underground tunnels: power sources to supply the electronic distribution or radio
equipment are scarce and therefore alternative methods, such as the use of radiating
cables or leaky feeders, are employed. Also, it is likely that interference with the
operation of highly sensitive electronic equipment can be produced and therefore
special care should be taken for cable or antenna placement in the tunnels. CCTV
monitoring and security cameras could also potentially interfere with cables for wireless
signal distribution.
In addition, special characteristics of underground environments such as curves,
changes in elevation, humidity and surface texture of a tunnel wall can be non-RF
friendly for radio propagation.Photographs depicting underground stations critical zones: (a) platforms; (b) transit areas.
Figure 3.11 Underground stations critical zones: (a) platforms; (b) transit areas.

60
Indoor Wireless Communications
For maintenance purposes, there are space limitations as subways and tunnels can be
quite crowded and access to them is limited; that is it can be difﬁcult to install and
maintain radio infrastructure there. Dirt and dust present in these environments can
impose further challenges; thus radio equipment should be properly enclosed.
Wireless service providers (WSPs) often deliver multiple services across multiple
licensed RF bands in underground stations, with the possibility of sharing a common
radio distribution infrastructure to minimize costs and space. Thus, wireless systems
installed there should have sufﬁcient frequency and protocol ﬂexibility.
3.1.9
Cinemas and Theatres
Also known as movie theatres, these are commercial operations catering to the general
public, who attend to watch a ﬁlm or movie. These are environments that can potentially
congregate people who normally switch their devices off while the show, play or ﬁlm is
on, but who, on the other hand, use their wireless devices while in halls, lounges or other
spaces within the theatre.
For cinemas or theatres, coverage is desired in lounges, toilets and waiting rooms, but
should be excluded in the main auditorium; therefore, good isolation should exist
between the auditorium and the other spaces.
Materials and layouts vary from country to country; some are ancient buildings with
concrete and stone walls, producing high propagation losses and blocking radio signals;
others are more modern and constructed of lighter materials that allow RF signals to
penetrate.
As wireless technology develops, there might be the possibility in the near future that
viewers may access remote locations with the use of a portable terminal (for example, to
monitor their house via TV cameras).
Figure 3.12 shows typical areas for which wireless coverage is desired in a cinema.
3.1.10
Hotels
Hotels are a very important type of building for any wireless service provider and hotel
owner, as connectivity is offered to guests during their stay as part of the hotel facilities.
The most popular wireless services offered to guests are Wi-Fi for wireless Internet and
cellular. Many hotels also have RFID tags for access control, car parks or guest
identiﬁcation.Photographs (a and b) depicting hot spot areas in a cinema.
Figure 3.12 Hot spot areas in a cinema.

61
3 System Requirements
For hospitality venues, reliable wireless coverage throughout the facility is required for
guest convenience and staff productivity, making sure key areas are properly covered; for
example lifts, guest rooms, lounges, ofﬁces, hallways, restaurants and meeting rooms,
which are the areas where it is more likely that guests will use their wireless devices. High
reliability should be guaranteed, as a bad wireless service can drastically impact the
guest's impression for 'service quality' (not necessarily related to the wireless service
provider but to the hotel!).
Also, special care should be taken as the indoor wireless solution must be aesthetically
pleasing and non-disruptive to the guest's experience.
Leakage should be controlled to contain coverage inside the hotel, for security reasons
as well as to minimize interference to external cells. Isolation between indoor and
outdoor cells should be properly accounted for, especially in ﬂoors well above ground
level, where macrocell penetration tends to dominate over a potential installed indoor
cell.
Multioperator and multitechnology solution for all types of guests using all sorts of
wireless network providers is nowadays becoming the preferred choice for hotels; give
guests 'whatever they want whenever they want it' for wireless connectivity. This implies
very good frequency planning as well as shared infrastructure negotiations.
For propagation considerations, the layout and materials for each ﬂoor are very
similar, especially those where guest rooms are located. This makes propagation
predictions and measurements heavily simpliﬁed.
An example of various views for different areas in a hotel is shown in Figure 3.13.Photographs depicting relevant coverage areas for a hotel: (a) rooms; (b) toilets; (c) lobby; (d) restaurants.

3.1.11
Cruise Ships
A cruise chip can be deﬁned as a 'moving building'; it is a transport system used by
tourists where wireless services need to be available anywhere inside the ship, where
wireless should work wherever passengers expect it to work. Another major issue is that
passengers often want to stay in touch with family or friends and hence wireless
connectivity becomes a major requirement.
There are a few important considerations in terms of requirements that need to be
taken into account for indoor coverage on board cruise ships. Perhaps one of the most
signiﬁcant is that there is no equivalent land terrestrial radio infrastructure for the sea
and thus all possible communications are established via satellite links. Therefore, there
must be a way to distribute satellite-based signals inside the ship efﬁciently.
The usage and operation of mobile devices on board a cruise ship may be subject to
strict regulations. A very good example is cellular mobile phone reception, which
normally is to be restricted in zones designated for relaxation and quietness for
passengers. Indoor wireless designers should take this into consideration. Later on,
we will see that these areas are referred as 'exclusion' zones.
The materials of which cruise ships are made are somehow a big impairment for the
propagation of radio signals. Vessels are constructed of dense, heavy metal materials that
highly attenuate wireless signals. Thus, sufﬁcient resources should be dedicated in terms
of equipment (antennas, access points, etc.) to provide the required QoS. However,
infrastructure installation and maintenance need to be simple, so as not to affect cruise
schedules or displace passengers. Figure 3.14 shows the interior of a cruise ship showing
various areas where wireless coverage is desired and others regarded as exclusion areas.
3.2 Coverage
Coverage is deﬁned as the amount of signal strength level that should be present in a
wireless system to meet a certain QoS for a particular service. This is applicable for
wireless systems, since coverage could have different meanings for other technologies.
For example, cellular operators often deﬁne indoor coverage requirements as a mini­
mum signal strength level within at least a percentile of an area of the building. This area
is normally termed the coverage requirement area, as seen in Figure 3.15.
In general, coverage is one of the most important requirements for any wireless
system. Without sufﬁcient coverage, access to the radio services cannot be achieved, or if
levels are not within speciﬁed minimum limits, the quality can be seriously degraded.
As seen in Figure 3.15, there might be some areas within the building in which
coverage is not desired and should be excluded. These areas are deﬁned as exclusion
areas, and the design may or may not attempt to minimize the signal strength there. This
is especially true, for example, in the case of prisons, where coverage should be
minimized inside the building, or for test laboratories, which need to be isolated
from external electromagnetic interference.
3.2.1
Cellular
For cellular systems, coverage requirements are normally speciﬁed in terms of a
minimum level over a certain percentile in a speciﬁed area within a building. Each

64
Indoor Wireless Communications
speciﬁc standard speciﬁes minimum requirements according to well-established rec­
ommendations. The way in which the requirement is speciﬁed varies from standard to
standard, but, overall, all refer to a minimum signal level that must be met in the desired
area. Operators normally take these recommendations and build up from those ﬁgures
to meet their speciﬁc coverage needs.
For GSM systems, the RxLev minimum coverage threshold for in-building systems is
speciﬁed as 85dBm or 5 to 7 dB greater than the residual macropilot, whichever is
higher. Mobile operators often specify this coverage threshold over a certain percentile
area; for example 90%.
For W-CDMA or 3G systems, this requirement is speciﬁed in terms of pilot strength/
CPICH RSCP greater than 85dBm or 5-7 dB greater than the residual macropilot,
whichever is higher. This is turn is converted by system designers in a minimum path
loss to meet from transmit to receive antennas, over a certain percentile of coverage area.
For an LTE wireless systems, target design values for indoor systems are in terms of
the RSRP (reference signal receive power), which should be greater than 100 dBm for a
5MHz channel if the residual macrosignal is very low. It should be 5-7dB higher if the
residual macrosignal is high.
3.2.2
Wi-Fi
Wireless local area networks have slightly different coverage requirements than those
speciﬁed in cellular systems. According to Geier (2001), coverage is speciﬁed in terms of
the signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) rather than a signal strength threshold.
For example, a signal level of 53 dBm measured near an access point and a typical noise
plus interference level of 90 dBm yields an SINR of 37dB, a reasonable and 'healthy'
value for wireless LANs.
An SINR directly impacts the performance of a wireless LAN connection. A higher
SINR value means that the signal strength is stronger in relation to the noise levels,
which allows higher data rates and fewer retransmissions - all of which offers better
throughput and therefore faster connections. On the other hand, a lower SINR requires
wireless LAN devices to operate at lower data rates, which decreases throughput. An
SINR of 30 dB, for example, may allow an 802.11g client radio and access point to
communicate at 24Mbps, whereas an SINR of 15 dB may only provide for 6Mbps.
From measurements reported in Geier (2008), user-oriented tests were conducted to
determine the impacts of SINR values on the ability for a user with a typical client radio
(set to 30mW) to associate with an 802.11b/g access point and load a particular webpage.
The following is reported for SINR:
 Greater than 40 dB = excellent signal (5 bars); always associated; fastest connection.
 25 dB to 40dB = very good signal (3-4bars); always associated; very fast.
 15 dB to 25dB = low signal (2 bars); always associated; usually fast.
 10 dB to 15dB = very low signal (1 bar); mostly associated; mostly slow.
 5 dB to 10 dB = no signal; not associated; no go.
Target SINRs are therefore speciﬁed by each speciﬁc WISP (wireless Internet service
provider) when deploying large Wi-Fi installations, and so, based on this, the number of
access points required to cover a certain area can be speciﬁed. For the home, access
points are deployed more empirically, without taking the SINR values too much into

65
3 System Requirements
consideration - as long as there is enough signal in the desired coverage areas this is
enough!
There is an important limiting factor that should be taken into consideration when
designing for coverage for Wi-Fi: Access points have a maximum allowed transmit
power, which has been deﬁned by the standards and varies depending on the speciﬁc
standard and region. These regulations are speciﬁed in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic
radiated power), which take into account cable losses and antenna gains. Table 2.3 shows
EIRP maximum levels for 802.11b/g and 802.11a standards. Special care should be taken
here when choosing antennas for the APs, since according to the EIRP deﬁnition, higher
antenna gain would be proportionally converted in an increase of the EIRP. This is the
case, for example, when coverage is to be enhanced, and highly directional antennas
(such as Yagis) are used for 'bridging' two buildings.
Section 2.2 summarizes some system requirements and characteristics that are
relevant to Wi-Fi and which should be considered for designing a Wi-Fi system.
3.2.3
Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN)
Technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, IrDA (Infrared Data Association), wireless USB,
Z-Wave and BAN (body area network) fall within this category in which the term
'coverage' is more referred to the capability of a device being within the range of another
one willing to establish communications (or associate with). In other words, coverage
requirements are more speciﬁed in terms of receiver sensitivity of the devices them­
selves, which is clearly regulated by the standard. Some examples for this are given below.
 For Bluetooth, a receiver sensitivity of 70 dBm or better is required (IEEE 802.16,
2015).
 For ZigBee, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (2003) sets the requirements for the 85 dBm
one percent packet ratio (PER) minimum sensitivity. In practice, and according to Le
(2010), sensitivity depends of a minimum SNR that guarantees the target error rate as
well as a given receiver noise ﬁgure. Table 3.1 shows typical sensitivity data for the
different data rates speciﬁed there.
Thus, in order to meet such received power demands, these devices should have
transmitters capable of providing enough power, according to the link budget
calculations and the type of propagation environment, as will be discussed later in
this book.

3.3 Isolation
In the context of indoor wireless communications, isolation is referred to as the ability of
a system to divide or isolate different areas of a wireless network. For example, for
cellular systems, isolation is a property that is related to how well the outdoor cell is
maintained isolated from the indoor cell, to avoid interference or excessively frequent
soft handovers, for 3G and LTE systems. An example of isolation from the indoor cell to
the outdoor macrocell in a stadium is shown in Figure 3.16. The really hard issue here is
to guarantee that the coverage from the indoor cell is dominant inside the stadium.
Sometimes this can also be controlled by adjusting the macroantennas downtilt as well as
the transmit power.
In RF terms, isolation is related to how well a port is isolated from another port in a
device. For example, the ratio (in dB) of the power level applied at one port of a mixer to
the resulting power level at the same frequency appearing at another port is treated as
isolation, and can be seen as an attenuation. For multitechnology or multioperator
systems, co-located antennas that operate at various frequency bands should have some
degree of isolation to guarantee that there is not adjacent channel interference that could
degrade system performance.
The requirements for isolation vary from system to system and have a stronger
inﬂuence on cellular systems, speciﬁcally 3G. Users in ofﬁce buildings, for example, are
typically close to windows; thus the dominance of the indoor system must be maintained
throughout the building, even right next to the windows (Tolstrup, 2011). Also, for Wi-Fi
systems, isolation is important as the indoor network should be prevented from hackers
willing to access it from outside.
For GSM systems, a level of isolation of at least 11dB is required, plus a margin of
around 6-10dB to account for fading (Tolstrup, 2011). For UMTS, a good guideline is to
design the indoor cell to be 10-15dB more powerful inside the building than any outside
macrocell signal, just being careful not to leak excessive signal outside the building, as
discussed in Section 2.4.Figure depicting isolation of an indoor cell from a macrocell in a stadium.

Figure 3.17 Leakage concept.
3.4
Leakage
In addition to coverage and isolation requirements, signal strength should be maintained
at restricted levels to avoid signal spillage outside the building. This signal spillage is
known as leakage, and is often desired to be kept at a minimum level over a percentile of
an area outside the building. This area is deﬁned as the leakage requirement area, as
shown in Figure 3.17.
Although leakage is a serious issue for GSM networks, it can be counterbalanced with
antenna downtilting from the external macrocell to make sure the macro dominates in
the external areas of the building. For 3G systems, it becomes more critical due to soft
handovers: if the coverage area of the indoor cell overlaps excessively out of the building
with the macro cell, excessive soft handovers may occur, which can result in an overload
of network resources, hence affecting system performance.
For Wi-Fi networks, leakage can represent a threat to the security of the network, as
potential hackers can have access to the network if coverage is not controlled out of the
building or corporate premises. For personal area networks, such as Bluetooth or ZigBee,
leakage is not an issue, as devices communicate with each other.
3.5
Capacity
As the demand for wireless services increases, the number of channels assigned to a cell
eventually becomes insufﬁcient to support the required number of users. At this point,
wireless design techniques are needed to provide more system resources per unit
coverage area, that is to expand the capacity of wireless systems. Therefore, wireless
service operators aim to maximize the efﬁciency of their networks in terms of increasing
the number of users accommodated per coverage area. For example, for cellular, this can
be achieved by increasing the number of available channels in the cell or by using other

68
Indoor Wireless CommunicationsFigure depicting three-sector configuration employed to increase capacity in an urban area.
Figure 3.18 Three-sector conﬁguration employed to increase capacity in an urban area.
techniques such as sectorization (outdoor), zoning (indoor) or cell splitting (Saunders
and Aragón-Zavala, 2007). These are explained brieﬂy as follows:
 Sectorization is a technique used in cellular systems to increase the number of users
connecting to the network over a given area. This enhancement is achieved by
replacing an omnidirectional conﬁguration by a combination of two, three or six
sectors using directional antennas, pointing to different locations and thus minimizing
co-channel interference, as depicted in Figure 3.18.
 Zoning is the term often employed for sectorization if done indoors and zones are in
essence similar to sectors in a macrocell outdoor environment. The distinction is that
sectors are delimited using antenna radiation patterns primarily, whilst zones are
separated by choosing groups of antennas that are isolated by virtue of in-building
penetration losses. An example of the selection of these zones is given in Figure 3.19.
The capacity of a network is then often expressed as a percentile of maximum blocking
probability or minimum grade of service. Blocking occurs as a result of a user attempting
to make a phone call without available channels in the cell. On the other hand, the grade

3 System Requirements
of service (GoS) is a measure of the ability of a user to access a trunked system during the
busiest hour. The busy hour is based upon customer demand at the busiest hour during a
week, month or year. The GOS is therefore a benchmark used to deﬁne the desired
performance of a particular trunked system by specifying a desired likelihood of a user
obtaining channel access given a speciﬁc number of channels available in the system. It is
part of the system design process to estimate the maximum required capacity and to
allocate the proper number of channels in order to meet the GoS. This is often the case
for GSM cellular systems.
For 3G, capacity requirements are treated slightly differently. It is often said that 3G
cellular systems have a 'soft capacity' in that the maximum number of users the network
can grant access to does not necessarily depend on the number of available channels in
the pool - we are in a CDMA system where all users can access the network using the
same channel at the same time, but just having different codes. However, as more users
access the network, the levels of interference increase and this reduces the maximum
capacity of the network (Holma and Toskala, 2010). This is, of course, the case for noise
rise as well, where special care should be taken not to overload the noise, especially in the
uplink.
For LTE networks, capacity dimensioning is not too different from the other
standards. The number of subscribers in a speciﬁc coverage area needs to be determined,
along with an estimated forecast for the following years - remember that capacity is
often installed for present and future needs. Trafﬁc proﬁles are deﬁned by each operator,
from which trafﬁc mix and models are used. Once this is completed, a rough estimate of
the cell size and site count are performed to verify whether, with a given site density, the
system can carry the speciﬁed load or new sites have to be added. In LTE, the main
indicator of capacity is SINR (signal-to-interference and noise ratio) distribution in the
cell. Thus, SINR can be directly mapped into system capacity (data rate) or cell
throughput.
Other wireless technologies follow different approaches. For instance, for Wi-Fi
networks, throughput is strongly inﬂuenced by both SINR levels and the number of
users associated with the same AP. Since more users increase the number of packet
collisions, the standard prevents this and reduces the data rate as more lost packets are
detected. On the other side, coverage is strongly related to data rates and system capacity
for a Wi-Fi network. Data rates affect AP coverage areas. Lower data rates, such as
1Mbps, can extend the coverage area farther from the AP than higher data rates, such as
54Mbps. Thus, the data rate and power level affects coverage and consequently the
number of APs required, which in turn determines the maximum number of users in a
Wi-Fi system. Therefore, a careful channel planning should be performed, especially
taking into consideration that Wi-Fi contiguous channels overlap and that co-channel
interference can affect the system performance considerably, as it has a direct impact on
SINR levels.
For wireless local area networks (WLANs), capacity is normally closely related to the
number of simultaneous users accessing the network, which in turn can severely degrade
the system throughput during peak trafﬁc hours. For some densely populated buildings,
more APs are placed to dedicate more channels to the same coverage area and therefore
satisfy the required demand. Special care should be taken in selecting the channels to be
used to avoid co-channel interference. To illustrate how to dimension a WLAN
deployment, let us assume a three-storey ofﬁce building of 220  220 m, as shown

for 2.4 GHz and 5GHz are given in Table 3.2.
For more detailed capacity calculations, refer to Chapter 8.
3.6 Interference
Interference is the major limiting factor in the performance of cellular radio systems, as
has been mentioned for 3G cellular, LTE and Wi-Fi. Sufﬁcient received signal levels are
not sufﬁcient to guarantee a certain quality of service; interference levels should also be
taken into account, especially for broadband wireless systems.
Sources of interference include another mobile in the same cell, a call in progress in a
neighbouring cell, other base stations operating in the same frequency band or any non­
cellular system that inadvertently leaks energy into the cellular frequency band.

71
3 System Requirements
The two major types of system-generated cellular interference are co-channel
interference and adjacent-channel interference. Co-channel interference comes as a
result of several cells using the same set of frequencies and hence users from distant cells
interfering with those of the wanted cell. On the other hand, interference resulting from
signals that are adjacent in frequency to the desired signal is called adjacent-channel
interference. Adjacent-channel interference results from imperfect receiver ﬁlters that
allow nearby frequencies to leak into the passband.
For either type of interference, a system requirement is necessary to ensure that
interference levels are kept to a minimum level to achieve certain QoS. For GSM, the
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is often used, in dB, and represents the level of signal
exceeding interference. For instance, a GSM voice system may require at least an SIR
level of 15dB to guarantee a certain quality of speech. More speciﬁcally, for indoor
systems, a CIR (carrier-to-interference ratio) of 9dB is needed for co-channel interfer­
ence, whereas at least 5dB of CIR are left for adjacent channel interference. For UMTS
systems, the signal energy-per-chip to noise and interference density ratio is used, for
which the noise is often not speciﬁed in the acronym since it is much less than the
interference levels, yielding Ec=I0, in dB. A pilot Ec=I0 > 5 dB at 50% cell loading is
often speciﬁed by operators for in-building. LTE networks use the SINR in dB to specify
minimum levels of received signal above noise and interference to guarantee a cell
throughput, given a certain scenario and MCS (modulation and coding scheme).
For licence-free bands, such as the ISM which is used by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth,
interference can become a more serious threat. In fact, WLAN networks have to perform
careful frequency planning to avoid overlapping channels to interfere with each other,
since the use of contiguous channels is not an option for the designer. Other devices such
as microwave ovens, baby monitors, some cordless phones and Bluetooth operate in the
same frequency band as Wi-Fi, and therefore protocols should be robust enough to
support fairly high levels of interference - as is the case of Bluetooth. According to the
IEEE standards, for 802.11b/g, the adjacent channel rejection should be of at least 35dB
at 25 MHz from the centre frequency of the receiver. In the case of out-of-band
interference, caused by spurious emissions from out-of-band appliances, an out-of­
band transmit power of 13 dBm=MHz is recommended according to IEEE standards.
In HSPA (high-speed packet access) networks, a very important target design KPI (key
performance indicator) is the SINR, as for LTE, which must be greater than 10 dB to
guarantee good performance. As SINR and related data throughput are vendor speciﬁc,
different operators may have distinct target values; for example, SINR of 15 dB for a data
throughput of 7.2 Mbps.
3.7
Signal Quality
So far, we have described various requirements that are essential for an indoor wireless
system for proper operation. Many of these requirements are established on the basis
that a minimum signal quality is expected in the wireless system, for sound performance.
Here are a few examples:
 Traditionally, cellular operators have measured and benchmarked their network
performance in GSM using mostly the bit error rate (BER) and the dropped call

72
Indoor Wireless Communications
rate (DCR) to quantify the speech quality and the rate of lost connections, respectively.
There are special venues, such as stadiums, in which the DCR will give an indication of
how well handover areas have been designed.
 In GSM, BER is mapped into RxQual, where values range from 0 (BER= 0.14%) to 7
(BER= 18.1%). Additionally, the call success rate (CSR) and the handover success rate
(HSR) have been used to measure the performance of the signalling channels
associated with call originations and handovers - these KPIs are also very relevant
for some buildings since sectorization is a common practice to provide radio coverage
and therefore excessive handovers should be minimized. However, on the other hand,
successful handovers must be guaranteed in well-delimited areas. For data KPIs and
for packet-switched (PS) GPRS, the most important parameters are reliability,
throughput and delay.
 For LTE networks, RSRQ (reference signal receive quality) should be greater than 5dB
for 50% cell loading.
3.8 Technology
A careful assessment of the technology available to design an indoor wireless system
should not be overlooked, especially in a high demanding and dynamic market such as
the one in personal communications. For example, cellular operators may be aiming to
be at the vanguard in the latest technology, but this does not necessarily ensure that
system performance has been fully optimized. The use of state-of-the-art technology
does not guarantee that the indoor cellular system is well designed, but nevertheless
represents a valuable infrastructure from which system performance can be enhanced
and optimized.
There is no "recipe" to choose the best technology for a project. It is often the case of
evaluating all the alternatives that are available for a given set of operational require­
ments. In general, this tends to be the main driving force for the choice of technology.
However, technology cannot be seen as a standalone factor, as it is normally closely
related to other factors, such as cost and complexity. A careful balance of all these factors
should be made for a successful design.
Finally, technology is perhaps one of the fastest changing requirements of all for
wireless communications. Newer possibilities may exist within the timelines of a project,
which can provide additional beneﬁts to the system. Permanent research on the state-of­
the-art is therefore highly recommended, in order to select the best possible technology
at all times.
3.9 Cost
Costs should also be maintained within the budget of the project, and therefore key
decisions about the selection of the most appropriate technology are essential. These
decisions cannot be accurately made if a limited knowledge of what these options are
exists. There is, however, a cost requirement that is taken as universally accepted: design
the best solution with the lowest possible budget!

73
3 System Requirements
There are many factors that can affect the cost of a project and which should be taken
into account when specifying requirements. These are summarized as follows:
 Equipment and technology costs. These are perhaps the most obvious expenditures,
having all the required 'bits and bobs' to make the system go up and running.
 Development costs. Even if a wireless service provider or operator has its own
engineering group, this represents a cost in man-hour terms that should not be
overlooked and must therefore be budgeted appropriately.
 Maintenance costs. Once the indoor wireless system is installed, there is a need to
keep it 'healthy' and thus sufﬁcient maintenance costs should be accounted for in the
planning process.
 Installation costs. The costs of installing the system may have an impact on the
choice of technology; for example, if the budget is limited, a passive distribution
system for cellular may not be an option if optical ﬁbre is already available in the
building and therefore installation costs can be signiﬁcantly reduced.
 Operational costs. These are related with the operation of the system and are
normally budgeted as a post-installation cost. These may also have an impact on
the design of the wireless system, as the choice of a speciﬁc technology can represent
much higher operational costs; for example a larger network.
Speciﬁc details associated with various types of costs and ﬁnancial issues to be taken
into account when deploying and operating an indoor wireless network are covered in
Chapter 12.
3.10
Upgradeability
Many wireless technologies used inside buildings have fast developments and upgrades
that should be considered before a new system is to be deployed. Some room should
therefore be left to account for upgrades. A very clear example of this is in the Wi-Fi
world, where for years the only approved standard was 802.11b. Recently, higher speeds
can be achieved using the same frequency (2.4 GHz) in the 802.11g standard. Thus, the
originally installed WLAN infrastructure should be able to migrate from 802.11b to
802.11g. Another example is the evolution in cellular from 2G to 3G, for instance, from
GSM to UMTS. Albeit the differences in technologies, the possibility of upgrading a
GSM indoor system to a UMTS indoor system planned since the beginning can
drastically reduce migration time and costs.
It is fair to say that sometimes it is difﬁcult to foresee the characteristics of emerging
technologies in order to account for upgrades and design totally ﬂexible systems. There
are cases, however, where most of the existing infrastructure should be replaced; if this is
the case, a sufﬁcient budget should therefore be allowed for this migration, which does
not only take ﬁnancial but also human and time resources.
One key aspect to take into consideration when performing system upgrades in an
indoor system is the type of trafﬁc that needs to be handled. In the early days of mobile
communications, voice was the main driver and all efforts were around the provision of
good voice quality to customers. Nowadays, this requirement has been superseded by
the enormous increase of mobile data trafﬁc and the creation of newer and more

74
Indoor Wireless Communications
sophisticated mobile devices that allow the use of mobile Internet virtually anywhere at
any time. If an upgrade is required to accommodate data trafﬁc and allow users to access
the Internet, for example, in an IP-based system, special care should be taken when
considering that voice needs also to be delivered. This may seem a straightforward
consideration but, believe it or not, sometimes is not carefully assessed and no matter
how good data service you may have, the voice is quite not there!
3.11
System Expansion
A good example where system expansion can play a decisive role is an indoor network
deployment in an airport. Airports normally increase their number of passengers per
year, and therefore are subject to expansions in their wireless infrastructure. Thus,
careful planning should be in place to allow system expansion in terms of capacity and
possible additional areas to provide wireless coverage. This also includes the possibility
of adding more wireless services to be offered to passengers, visitors and airport staff.
There are special venues for which system expansion can result in a critical variable:
stadiums. As we all know, stadiums not only hold sports events but for off-season periods
concerts and massive events are taking place here, with a substantial increase in the need
of wireless coverage and capacity. Due to cost constraints, it is often hard to deploy all the
maximum network capacity in a stadium since the beginning, and thus this needs to be
done periodically. Meanwhile, the capacity has to be shared with outdoor networks,
resulting sometimes in blockage and excessive delays in data trafﬁc that degrade system
performance. At the earliest convenience it is very important to deploy the required
capacity to accommodate all voice and data trafﬁc, especially for in-building systems.
3.12
Conclusion
Every good indoor wireless system design should take as a reference a well-established
set of requirements. The more ambiguous these requirements are, the less likely the
system has optimum performance. It is therefore worth spending enough time to deﬁne
these requirements from many different perspectives: technical, operational, ﬁnancial
and even physical. These requirements will dictate the characteristics of the design and
will determine the technology to be used. It is often the case that design compliance
standards need to be checked against these requirements, as will be discussed later.

Radio Propagation
Radio wave propagation is a key topic for an in-building wireless system designer. The
underlying theory that gives rise to the production of radio waves is reviewed here, which
(alongside light) are examples of electromagnetic waves. The simplest form of wave is a
plane wave, which illustrates many of the ways in which more complex waves interact
with their surroundings (e.g. a building). The properties of materials (e.g. walls, windows,
roofs and trees) are also explained, which are relevant to their impact on waves.
There is theoretically an inﬁnite number of ways in which waves interact with
materials, which can be broken down into a small number of mechanisms. By under­
standing each of these mechanisms in turn an appreciation of the nature of the effects
that are observed in practical in-building design is developed. These mechanisms,
combined with the complicated structure of real buildings, make the practical prediction
of in-building propagation very challenging, as stated for the various environments in the
previous chapter.
Propagation effects are so important to indoor radio design that an entire chapter is
dedicated to a deeper study and understanding of such mechanisms. In fact, radio waves
interact in many ways with building walls, furniture, people, etc., and depend on aspects
such as construction materials so these should be carefully considered for more accurate
work.
4.1
Maxwell's Equations
Radio wave propagation has its foundations in electromagnetic theory principles.
Electromagnetism is a very mature subject, which established its foundations many
centuries ago, and it is expected that you have a basic understanding and background of
its basic principles. It is out of the scope of this book to provide a detailed analysis of
electromagnetic theory and principles that form the basis of Maxwell's equations.
However, interested readers willing to expand their knowledge or review such principles
can refer to Sadiku (2007), Kraus and Fleisch (1999) and Hayt and Buck (2011).
The existence of propagating electromagnetic waves can be predicted as a direct
consequence of Maxwell's equations. These equations are a set of four partial differential

equations, which specify the relationships between the variations of the vector electric
ﬁeld E and the vector magnetic ﬁeld H in time and space within a medium. The E ﬁeld
strength is measured in volts per meter and is generated by either a time-varying

mathematician, synthesized previously unrelated observations, experiments and equa­

force' (Maxwell, 1861). He then added the term displacement current to one of the
equations in Maxwell (1865).
Maxwell's four equations are summarized in this section, where a brief explanation is
given to each.
4.1.1
Gauss's Law for Electricity
Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855), shown in Figure 4.1(b), a German mathematician and
scientist, contributed extensively to magnetism (hence the unit Gauss for magnetic ﬂux
density after his name) and in 1835 developed his famous Gauss's law, which in fact was
not published until 1867. Gauss's law states that: the electric ﬂux through any closed
surface is proportional to the enclosed electric charge. In differential (4.1) and integral
(4.2) forms, respectively, Gauss's law can be expressed as

In (4.2), the left-hand side of the equation is a surface integral denoting the electric ﬂux
through a closed surface S and the right-hand side of the equation is the total charge
enclosed by S, obtained by integrating the volumetric charge density, ρv.
Free-space permittivity is ε0  8:85  1012 F=m, and, in practice, wireless links are
assumed to have free-space permittivity. However, should the radio wave propagate in a
different medium, a different constant should be considered. Recall that the permittivity
of a material is related to its electrical properties and each material is given a certain
relative permittivity εr. This is discussed later in this chapter.
The mathematics under Equations (4.1) and (4.2) are rather complex, but its physical
interpretation is much more important and relevant to the understanding of the
phenomena behind indoor radio propagation. In summary, Gauss's law demonstrates
that electric ﬁeld lines may either start/end on charges or are continuous, as seen in
Figure 4.2. Electric charges are therefore sources of electric ﬁeld lines and can exist as
monopoles.
Gauss's law is also known as Gauss's ﬂux theorem and can be used to derive Coulomb's
law, which is said to be its dual equation in magnetism.
4.1.2
Gauss's Law for Magnetism
Electricity and magnetism always have dual laws and equations. For Gauss's law, there is

its counterpart for magnetism, which states that the divergence of any magnetic ﬁeld

monopoles cannot exist. In mathematical form:

In integral form, as stated in (4.5), the net ﬂux of magnetic ﬁeld lines will always be zero
as the same number of lines that emanate from the magnetic ﬁeld source return back to
it, as shown in Figure 4.3. This implies the existence of magnetic dipoles in the universe,

Faraday's Law of Induction
Electromagnetic induction was discovered and ﬁrst published in 1831 by Michael
Faraday (1791-1867), shown in Figure 4.1(c), an English chemist and physicist, by
discovering that a time-changing magnetic ﬂux creates a proportional electromotive
force. Faraday also studied the magnetic ﬁeld around a conductor carrying a continuous
electric current and discovered diamagnetism and the laws of electrolysis. He was also a
very successful inventor or various electromagnetic rotary devices, which in turn form
the foundation of modern electric motors.
The discovery of electromagnetic induction had been in fact the subject of debate and
controversy, as Joseph Henry (1797-1878), an American scientist, also discovered
mutual inductance independently of Michael Faraday. However, it was demonstrated
that Faraday was the ﬁrst to publish his results. Nevertheless, the unit of inductance,
Henry, is named in his honour.
Faraday's law of induction states: the induced electromotive force or EMF in any closed
circuit is equal to the time rate of change of the magnetic ﬂux through the circuit (Sadiku,
2007). In its original form, Faraday's law was expressed as a single equation describing
two different phenomena: the motional electromotive force generated by a magnetic
force on a moving wire and the transformer electromotive force generated by an electric
force due to a changing magnetic ﬁeld. It was not until 1861 when J.C. Maxwell drew
attention to this fact and in Maxwell (1961) he gave a separate physical explanation for

each of the two phenomena. Thus, Faraday's law of induction in the form of a partial
differential equation is often known as the Maxwell-Faraday equation. In integral and
differential forms, it can be expressed as

last two of Maxwell's equations are called curl equations due to this. By looking at (4.7)
carefully, a time-changing magnetic ﬁeld B can produce an electric ﬁeld, which is

orthogonal to the original magnetic ﬁeld. Equation (4.8) is a direct consequence of
Green's theorem and represents the same induction principle (Hayt and Buck, 2011).
4.1.4
Ampère's Circuital Law
The fourth Mawxell equation is known as Ampère's circuital law, after André-Marie
Ampère (1775-1836), shown in Figure 4.1(d), a French physicist and mathematician,
who is often referred as one of the main discoverers of electromagnetism. In fact, the unit
of measurement for electric current, the ampere, is named after him.
Ampère's law was discovered in 1826 and states that magnetic ﬁelds can be generated
in two ways: by an electric current circulating in a wire and by changing electric ﬁelds. In
other words, it integrates the magnetic ﬁeld around a closed loop to the electric current
passing through the loop. In mathematical form:

A new term is introduced in both (4.9) and (4.10), called current density vector J
is used to denote direction and magnitude of electric current circulating in a wire.
Equation (4.9), in particular, indicates that a changing electric ﬁeld or a current can
create a magnetic ﬁeld, orthogonal to the original electric ﬁeld.
4.1.5
Consequence of Maxwell's Equations
The last two equations, Maxwell's curl equations, contain constants of proportionality,
which dictate the strengths of the ﬁelds. These are the permeability of the medium μ in
henrys per meter and the permittivity of the medium ε in farads per meter. They are
normally expressed relative to the values in free space, μ0, ε0:
μ  μ0μr
(4.11)
ε  ε0εr
(4.12)
The relative permeability and permittivity represent intrinsic properties of materialsand
therefore are taken as multiplicative factors to obtain the actual values of permeability
and permittivity for any material, having the free-space values as reference. The
permeability in free space is 4π  107 H=m, whereas the free-space permittivity is
8:85  1012 F=m.
Free space strictly indicates a vacuum, but the same values can be used as good
approximations in dry air at typical temperatures and pressures.
Maxwell's equations do not only anticipate the possibility of using electromagnetic
waves for wireless communications but also have set a full range of applications where
electric and magnetic ﬁelds are somehow involved, as is the case of machines that make
use of induction principles to operate (transformers, motors, alternators, generators,
etc.). Our focus, however, is on the wireless communications world, and thus all the
remaining references to Maxwell's equations legacy will be made on that basis.
4.2 Plane Waves
There is a striking result that can be obtained from the solution to the curl equations.
Since one of them suggests that a time-varying magnetic ﬁeld produces an electric ﬁeld
whereas the other dictates that a time-varying electric ﬁeld or a current produce a
changing magnetic ﬁeld, thus a travelling electromagnetic wave is generated, as a result of
the interactions of both ﬁelds over space and time.
In free space, many types of waves can exist, which satisfy Maxwell's equations; that is
constitute valid solutions. Amongst the most popular ones are spherical, cylindrical and
plane waves, as shown in Figure 4.4. However, any wave type can be represented as a
)
collection of plane waves; thus these are the fundamental types of waves that need to be
examined. They are typically simpler to analyse than the other types, so they provide a

Note that all of these wave shapes can exist at the same time in a given area of space
and they pass through each other without interacting (at least in the 'linear' materials,
which are normal in buildings and at low power levels). A very good example of
cylindrical waves is that produced by radiating cables, as shown in Figure 4.5, which will
be analysed in more detail later on in this book.
4.2.1
Wave Equation
Suppose the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are in free space, so both permeability and
permittivity are those of free space. Thus, as they are in a non-conducting medium, the
vector current density J is zero. Note that Maxwell's equations state that electric and
magnetic ﬁelds are always orthogonal to each other, so the assumption here is that E and
H have components as suggested in Figure 4.6.Figure depicting electric and magnetic fields in free space.
Figure 4.6 Electric and magnetic ﬁelds in free space.

84
Indoor Wireless Communications
Notice that it is assumed the generated waves will be travelling in the x-direction.
Thus, by rearranging both curl equations, wave equations for the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds can be obtained (Hayt and Buck, 2011):

then, rearranging equation (4.13) in terms of velocity and using (4.15) gives

By examining (4.16) carefully, the dimensions of v truly represent a velocity, which in
turn shows that the wave travels at the speed of light in free space 3  108 m=s.
From (4.16), the electric ﬁeld wave equation, many solutions exist, all of which
represent ﬁelds that could actually be produced in practice. However, they can all be
represented as a sum of plane waves, which represent the simplest possible time-varying
solution. A general solution can then be found if
Ey  E0 cosωt  kx  E0 cosωt  kx

The wavenumber k represents the number of wavelengths λ per unit distance, 2π=λ, and
ω is the angular frequency in radians per second, which is related to linear frequency as
ω  2πf . Notice that (4.17) shows that travelling plane waves in both directions
represent a solution to the wave equation, both in time and space, having a maximum
electric ﬁeld of E0. More generally, using vector notation, the electric ﬁeld can be
expressed as

Similarly, since E and H are perpendicular to each other, an expression for the magnetic
ﬁeld can be obtained:

In (4.19), H0 is the maximum magnetic ﬁeld intensity, in A/m.
4.2.2
Plane Wave Properties
As seen in Figure 4.6, the direction of propagation of the wave is along the x-axis. The
vector in this direction is the propagation vector or the Poynting vector. The two ﬁelds
are in phase at any point in time or in space. Their magnitude is constant in the yz plane,

and a surface of constant phase (a wavefront) forms a plane parallel to the yz plane -
hence the term plane wave. This is better shown in Figure 4.7.
The oscillating electric ﬁeld produces a magnetic ﬁeld, which itself oscillates to
recreate an electric ﬁeld and so on, in accordance with Maxwell's curl equations. This
interplay between the two ﬁelds stores energy and hence carries power along the
Poynting vector S, which in fact describes the magnitude and direction of the power ﬂow
carried by the wave per square metre of area parallel to the yz plane, that is the power
density of the wave

Wave Polarization
The alignment of the electric ﬁeld vector of a plane wave relative to the direction of
propagation deﬁnes the polarization of the wave. For example, if the electric ﬁeld is

86
Indoor Wireless Communications
parallel to the x-axis, this wave is x-polarized and could be generated by a straight wire
antenna parallel to the x-axis. An entirely distinct y-polarized plane wave could be
generated with the same direction of propagation and recovered independently of the
other wave using pairs of transmit and receive antennas with perpendicular polarization.
This principle is sometimes used in satellite communications to provide two indepen­
dent communication channels on the same Earth satellite link. If the wave is generated
by a vertical wire antenna (H-ﬁeld horizontal) then the wave is said to be vertically
polarized; a wire antenna parallel to the ground (E-ﬁeld horizontal) primarily generates
waves that are horizontally polarized.
The waves described so far have been linearly polarized, since the electric ﬁeld vector
has a single direction along the whole of the propagation axis. If two plane waves of equal
amplitude and orthogonal polarization are combined with a 90° phase difference, the
resulting wave will be circularly polarized (CP), in that the motion of the electric ﬁeld
vector will describe a circle centred on the propagation vector. The ﬁeld vector will
rotate by 360° for every wavelength travelled. Circularly polarized waves are most
commonly used in satellite communications, since they can be generated and received
using antennas that are oriented in any direction around their axis without loss of power.
They may be generated as either right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) or left-hand
circularly polarized (LHCP); RHCP describes a wave with the electric ﬁeld vector
rotating clockwise when looking in the direction of propagation. In the most general
case, the component waves could be of unequal amplitudes or at a phase angle other than
90°. The result is an elliptically polarized wave, where the electric ﬁeld vector still rotates
at the same rate but varies in amplitude with time, thereby describing an ellipse. This can
be seen in Figure 4.8.
If there is a mismatch between the wave and receive antenna polarization, this
represents a loss that has to be taken into account when planning and designing a
wireless system. The polarization of standard mobile phones tends to be pretty random,
both due to movement by the user and the antenna characteristics itself, so signiﬁcantFigure depicting possible polarizations for a plane wave propagating along the z-axis.

87
4 Radio Propagation
polarization loss is often encountered. This is particularly enhanced inside buildings,
where multiple reﬂections and other depolarizing effects take place.
For indoor wireless communications, linear polarization is often the preferred method
of those described.
4.2.4
Wave Propagation in Lossy Media
So far only lossless media have been considered in our previous examples. This has been
done in order to introduce the properties of electromagnetic waves more simply. When
the medium has signiﬁcant conductivity σ, the amplitude of the wave diminishes with
distance travelled through the medium as energy is removed from the wave and
converted to heat (losses). Thus, new expressions for (4.18) and (4.19) need to be
derived, as follows:
E
H
)
)
αx
 E0e
cosωt  kxay
(4.24)
 H0eαx cosωt  kxaz
(4.25)
The constant α is known as the attenuation constant, with units of per metre (m1),
which depends on the permeability and permittivity of the medium, the frequency of the
wave and the conductivity of the medium, measured in siemens per metre, or per-ohm­
metre (Ωm1). Conductivity, permittivity and permeability are known as constitutive
parameters of the medium.
Depending on the constitutive parameters of materials, a classiﬁcation can be made as
good insulators or good conductors, for which the attenuation constant, wavenumber,
wave impedance, wavelength and phase velocity can be computed. From this, very
relevant information can be obtained from building construction materials, which will
have a direct impact on the way radio waves propagate inside a building, as we will see in
the next sections. More details on the equations used to derive wave parameters for lossy
media can be found in Saunders and Aragón-Zavala (2007).
4.3
Propagation Mechanisms
So far, the media in which waves were propagating consisted of regions within which the
constitutive parameters (i.e. properties of materials) did not vary in space, being inﬁnite
in extent in all directions, regardless of whether the materials were considered as good
conductors or insulators. In practice, however, the boundaries between media must be
considered for accurate radio propagation work; for example between air and the
ground, between buildings and the air, from Earth to space, etc. These boundary effects
give rise to changes in the amplitude, phase and direction of propagating waves. Almost
all of these effects can be understood in terms of combinations of simple propagation
mechanisms operating on plane waves. These mechanisms are now described and will
later be used to analyse wave propagation in the real world.
4.3.1
Is Electromagnetic Theory Wrong Inside Buildings?
A good start for this section could be a reﬂection on whether all the theory we have
reviewed so far is applicable to all environments. More speciﬁcally, we are concerned in

88
Indoor Wireless Communications
this book on wireless communications inside buildings. These principles have proven
right for hundreds of years, yet are almost applicable to all scenarios.
One can easily predict (and indeed measure) the behaviour of various materials in
isolation and determine that losses increase with frequency. For the moment, let us leave
this assumption right until we formally explain the mechanism that makes this loss
increase with frequency.
However, in the last decades, radio measurements inside buildings have proven a
different outcome to that expected by the theory. If losses are examined in practical
buildings, the building penetration loss has been found to decrease with frequency in
some studies but to increase in others. Clearly the mechanisms involved are rather
complex and hence need to be fully examined. In fact, such mechanisms tend to be more
sophisticated than those related to outdoor environments. This is precisely one of the
reasons why indoor radio propagation is considered much more difﬁcult and challenging
than outdoor radio propagation, and needs a good amount of understanding and effort.
The constitutive parameters of materials are themselves frequency-dependent, even
for relatively uniform walls, due to the speciﬁc molecular structure of the materials used.
For example, the relative permittivity for brick changes from 4.62 at 1.7 GHz down to
4.11 at 18 GHz. Commercial glass changes more drastically, from a permittivity of 4 at
VHF to a relative permittivity of 9 at microwave frequencies.
In order to understand how these constitutive parameters further affect wave
propagation, several propagation mechanisms need to be introduced, which are relevant
to in-building systems.
In summary, we can conclude that the legacy from electromagnetic theory still applies
well for practical buildings. However, we should also understand that the propagation
mechanisms inside buildings are more complex and make the signal behave quite
differently, as building geometries, shapes, roughness, etc., have an effect on the resulting
ﬁeld strength at a receiver.
4.3.2
Loss and Skin Effect
When the medium has signiﬁcant conductivity, the amplitude of the wave decreases with
distance travelled through the medium. This decrease depends also on the constitutive
parameters of the materials, and is accounted for by the attenuation constant. In
consequence, the ﬁeld strength for E and H decreases exponentially as the wave travels

through the medium, as shown in Figure 4.9. The distance through which the wave

depth δ (Figure 4.10), given by
1
δ 
(4.26)
α
Thus, when a plane wave interacts with conductive material, mobile charges within
the material are made to oscillate back and forth with the same frequency as the
impinging ﬁelds. The movement of these charges constitutes a very rapidly alternating
current, the magnitude of which is greatest at the conductor's surface, hence originating
this decline in ﬁeld strength.
Having the skin depth, it is possible to calculate the total ﬁeld at a penetration distance
x, as follows:
E x
x=δ
(4.27)
   E0e
E0 is the ﬁeld strength at the boundary, x is the penetration distance and E x
  is the ﬁeld
at the penetration distance. This equation reafﬁrms our initial statement made in Section
4.3.1: if it were for the skin effect in isolation, penetration losses for practical buildings
will always have to increase with frequency! It is time now to examine in detail all the
other mechanisms affecting these losses.
4.3.3
Reﬂection
Figure 4.11 shows a plane wave incident on to a plane boundary between two media with
different permeability and permittivity. Both media are assumed lossless for the moment.
The electric ﬁeld vector may be in any direction perpendicular to the propagation vector.
The propagation vector is at an angle θi to the surface normal at the point of incidence.

90
Indoor Wireless CommunicationsFigure depicting the case of reflection, where a plane wave incident on to a plane boundary between two media with different permeability and permittivity. The incident and reflected angles made by wave are θi and θr, respectively.
Figure 4.11 Reﬂection.
If Maxwell's equations are solved for this situation, the result is that two new waves are
produced, each with the same frequency as the incident wave. Both the waves have their
Poynting vectors in the plane, which contains both the incident propagation vector and
the normal to the surface (i.e. normal to the plane of the paper in Figure 4.11). This is
called the scattering plane.
The ﬁrst wave propagates within medium 1 but moves away from the boundary. It
makes an angle θr to the normal and is called the reﬂected wave.
When analysing reﬂection and refraction, it is convenient to work in terms of rays; in a
homogeneous medium rays are drawn parallel to the Poynting vector of the wave at the
point of incidence. They are always perpendicular to the wavefronts.
In the context of indoor radio propagation, reﬂections occur in conﬁned spaces, hence
producing multipath effects, which create deep fades (fast fading) in the received signal
strength. These reﬂections can be so severe, especially in corridors and tunnels, that they
can create other propagation effects; for example waveguiding.
4.3.4
Refraction (Transmission)
From Figure 4.12, the second wave produced from the incident wave travels on into
medium 2, making an angle θt to the surface normal. This is the transmitted wave (also
known as the refracted wave), which results from the mechanism of refraction.Figure depicting the case of refraction, where a plane wave incident on to a plane boundary between two media with different permeability and permittivity. The incident and refracted angles made by wave are θi and θt, respectively.
Figure 4.12 Refraction (transmission).

4 Radio PropagationPhotograph depicting the refraction of light, where a pen is dipped into a water filled glass. The position of the dipped portion of the pen displaced from it's original position.
Figure 4.13 Refraction of light, which is observed when light changes from air to water.
Refraction depends on the angle of incidence as well as on constitutive parameters of
materials. A very good example of how refraction affects a wave can be easily seen in a
glass of water towards which a beam of light is directed, as seen in Figure 4.13. It will be
seen that the ray of light 'bends' as it enters the water, which will mean that the medium
has changed.
The energy has to come from somewhere: greater transmission through a medium
implies less reﬂection and vice versa. Therefore a material that contains energy well
(good reﬂector) will also not allow much energy to pass through it (good shielding).
For in-building systems, signal penetration through walls and ﬂoors is possible due to
refraction. Wall and ﬂoor materials have a strong inﬂuence on the propagation
(transmission) losses and thus in the amount of signal that can be received after going
deeper into a building. As we will examine later in Chapter 4, many propagation models
rely on wall and ﬂoor penetration losses at various frequencies to improve path loss
prediction accuracy. Building penetration loss is the transmission loss experienced by a
signal as it penetrates an external wall of a building. This parameter is used when
coverage is to be provided from an external macrocell inside a building. Other
mechanisms should also be taken into account for better predictions, such as diffraction,
which is explained next.
4.3.5
Diffraction
This chapter has described ways in which the interactions between plane waves and
inﬁnite plane surfaces can be calculated with high accuracy, provided that the constitu­
tive parameters are known. In practice, however, these conditions are rarely fulﬁlled and
approximations must be made. For example, in a typical in-building scenario, the source

92
Indoor Wireless CommunicationsFigure depicting the diffracted rays occurring behind an obstructing obstacle.
Figure 4.14 Diffracted rays occurring behind an obstructing obstacle.
or transmit antenna could be located inside the building in one ﬂoor and a receive
antenna could be in another ﬂoor. Various reﬂections on walls and furniture, refractions
through walls as the wave is transmitted, some scattered energy and other effects may be
present before the radio wave reaches the receiver. These effects strongly depend on
frequency and speciﬁc building materials, plus the characteristics of the furniture.
One of the effects that often can be either neglected or underestimated is when the
path from the transmitter to the receiver is blocked, probably assuming that no energy is
present in the shadow region behind an absorbing obstruction. This suggests that there is
an inﬁnitely sharp transition from the shadow region to the illuminated region outside.
In practice, however, shadows are never completely sharp and some energy does
propagate into the shadow region, as depicted in Figure 4.14.
The effect due to which waves can propagate even into the shadow region behind an
obstruction is known as diffraction and can most easily be understood by using Huygen's
principle:
 Each element of a wavefront at a point in time may be regarded as the centre of a
secondary disturbance, which gives rise to spherical wavelets.
 The position of the wavefront at any later time is the envelope of all such wavelets.
Diffraction makes non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation possible inside buildings.
For example, the signal diffracts into a room through an open door or windows, even for
walls with high transmission losses. As long as the obstructions or 'sharp edges' are
within the 60% of the ﬁrst Fresnel zone radius, diffraction occurs and causes the signal to
reach areas that otherwise would not be possible.
4.3.6
Scattering
The reﬂection processes discussed so far have been applicable to smooth surfaces only;
this is termed specular reﬂection. When the surface is made progressively rougher, the
reﬂected wave becomes scattered from a large number of positions on the surface,
broadening the scattered energy. This reduces the energy in the specular direction and
increases the energy radiated in other directions, as shown in Figure 4.15.

93
4 Radio Propagation
Figure 4.15 Rough surface scattering.
The degree of scattering depends on the angle of incidence and on the roughness of
the surface in comparison to the wavelength. The apparent roughness of the surface is
reduced as the incidence angle comes closer to the grazing incidence (θi  90°) and as
the wavelength is made larger. This means that some surfaces can be considered
'smooth' at certain frequencies, but exhibit 'roughness' at higher frequencies.
If a surface is to be considered smooth, then waves reﬂected from the surface must be
only very slightly shifted in phase with respect to each other. A reasonable criterion for
considering a surface smooth is if this phase shift is less than 90°, which leads to the
Rayleigh criterion:
λ
Δh <
(4.28)
8 cos θi
The parameter Δh is known as the surface height difference, as shown in Figure 4.16. All
surfaces are considered smooth if the grazing incidence is considered.
For various building architectures, it is common that the inside walls have a rough
ﬁnishing that could lead to scattering, which needs to be taken into account for extra
losses. Thus, it is necessary to compute these losses.
As can be seen from Figure 4.16, the surface height difference is not a deterministic
parameter that can be calculated straightforwardly; this difference varies randomly for
every wall and thus we need to use probability to describe it.
It is correct to assume that Δh follows a Gaussian or normal distribution (Figure 4.17),
for which an expected value or mean of the surface height μΔh and a standard deviation
σΔh can be deﬁned.Figure depicting surface height difference Δh.
Figure 4.16 Surface height difference Δh:Figure depicting Gaussian distribution for surface height difference.
Figure 4.17 Gaussian distribution for surface height difference.

94
Indoor Wireless Communications
Once a surface has been determined to be 'rough' according to the Rayleigh criterion,
the amount of scattered energy needs to be computed. When the surface is rough, the
reduction in the amplitude of the specular component may be accounted for by
multiplying the corresponding value of the Fresnel specular reﬂection coefﬁcient R
by a roughness factor f , which depends on the angle of incidence and on the standard
deviation of the surface height σΔh. The formulation for this factor is:

they can contain components in either parallel, perpendicular or both directions; for
example the latter will be the case for circular polarization. Details on how to compute
the Fresnel specular reﬂection coefﬁcient R can be found in Saunders and Aragón-
Zavala (2007).
4.3.7
Waveguiding
Some corridors, airport piers and long enclosed spaces exhibit reﬂections and refractions
similar to those of a waveguide or tunnel. The waves reﬂect off the walls many times and
this has the effect of carrying the wave along the waveguide 'further' than would normally
be the case. The only provision is that the width of the waveguide must be much greater
than a wavelength, so unlike many other propagation effects the propagation loss in
waveguides actually reduces with frequency. This can be seen in Figure 4.18.
To understand waveguiding better, let us examine how path loss changes with
distance in an enclosed space, but with the transmitting antenna outside of the wave­
guide itself (e.g. imagine a transmitter in a large hallway with a corridor leading off it).
Notice how the ﬁeld drops rapidly in the ﬁrst few metres following entrance to the space.
This drop is dependent on the distance of the transmitting antenna from the entrance,
the angle of arrival of waves into the space relative to its axis, its cross-sectional area and
the frequency of operation. Propagation within the space is further inﬂuenced by the
space's shape and by the construction materials (see Figure 4.19).
Waveguiding is so important for enclosed spaces such as corridors, for example, that
they shouldbe understood and taken into account. Failure to account for waveguidingmay
result in being too pessimistic in signal coverage along this enclosed space, which may
result in exceeding the anticipated signal levels and possibly interfering with other systems.

95
4 Radio Propagation
Figure 4.18 Tunnel propagation, similar to what happens with waveguiding.
Figure 4.19 Waveguiding effect.
Waveguiding accounts for reﬂections and refractions given in areas such as corridors
or other narrow gaps between walls, which are characteristic of many buildings. This
effect depends on angles, material types and distances between walls, and produces what
is known as a waveguding gain, increasing the penetration depth along corridors.
Because of this, the path loss exponent in such environments appears to be less than
2, which is the one for free-space loss! See Figure 4.20 for an example of how waveguiding
can affect signal strength along a corridor - notice how the signal strength is maintained
along corridors, despite the large distances to the transmit antenna.
4.4
Effects of Materials
Maxwell's curl equations described in Section 4.1 also dictate special behaviour when
impinging on a material. Such behaviour depends on many factors, which can be
described depending on speciﬁc characteristics of the material. Some of these factors are:

96
Indoor Wireless CommunicationsFigure depicting strength of waveguiding inside a building.
Figure 4.20 Strength of waveguiding inside a building.
 The material properties, also known as constitutive parameters; that is conductivity,
permittivity and permeability. These characteristics dictate whether a material is to be
considered as either a good conductor or a good insulator and therefore how a wave
propagates through them varies (phase velocity, impedance, etc.). For practical cases,
conductivity and permittivity are the most important.
 The shape of the material and its roughness. As described in Section 4.3, reﬂections
and scattering depend on these properties, thus affecting the amount of loss that is
produced by the materials of the walls upon which the radio wave is impinging.
Diffraction is also affected, as 'sharp edges' accentuate this effect.
 The frequency and wavelength of the wave, which in turn makes a radio wave of a
speciﬁc wavelength exhibit different behaviour upon impinging or going through the
same material; that is propagation effects depend on frequency and hence wavelength
(Saunders and Aragón-Zavala, 2007).
 The type of wave; that is plane, spherical, cylindrical, etc.
Some properties of electromagnetic waves are changed depending on the constitutive
parameters of materials to which they propagate, such as phase velocity and wavelength.
However, materials also change waves in many other ways. For example, they change
direction and phase, as well as losing energy (attenuation) for those cases where waves
propagate through lossy materials.
The constitutive parameters of materials are themselves frequency dependent, even
for relatively uniform walls, due to the speciﬁc molecular structure of the materials used.
For example, the relative permittivity μ for brick changes from 4.62 at 1.7 GHz down to
r

97
4 Radio Propagation
4.11 at 18 GHz. The commercial glass change more drastically, from a permittivity of 4 at
VHF to a relative permittivity of 9 at microwave frequencies.
The building wall structure frequently has several layers, setting up multipath
interference and associated resonances within the structure. These can be analysed
by treating each layer as a section of a transmission line, with a characteristic impedance
determined by the wave impedance, the frequency and the angle of incidence. At each
boundary reﬂections are created leading to a set of multiple reﬂections with interference
between each contribution. For a deeper study on these effects, refer to Saunders and
Aragón-Zavala (2007).
Another good example of the effects of materials in radio propagation is that of a
metallized window. For a very lossy (highly conductive) medium or for very high
frequencies, the skin depth is small, so most of the current stays on the surface of the
material and the penetration depth is small. Therefore a window with metallization will
have a high current on its surface near an antenna but will allow little wave penetration.
Conversely, even a highly conductive material that is thinner than its skin depth will
still allow energy to pass through.
4.5
Path Loss
An average decrease of received ﬁeld strength as the mobile moves away from the base
station (macrocell if outdoors, picocell/femtocell if indoors) is often used to determine
the range of a wireless system. Most of the indoor path loss models, which will be
described in Chapter 5, aim to predict this average decrease, or path loss, which is
dependent on distance at given frequencies. A formal deﬁnition of path loss is therefore
required here.
The path loss between a pair of antennas is the ratio of the transmitted power to the
received power, usually expressed in decibels. It includes all of the possible elements of
loss associated with interactions between the propagating wave and any objects between
transmit and receive antennas.
4.5.1
Median Path Loss
In the case of channels with large amounts of fast fading (deep signal fades as the mobile
receiver moves away from the transmitter), such as mobile channels, the path loss applies
to the power averaged over several fading cycles (the local median path loss). This path
loss is hard to measure directly, since various losses and gains in the radio system also have
to be considered. These are best accounted for by constructing a link budget, which is
usually the ﬁrst step in the analysis of a wireless communication system and is discussed in
detail in Section 4.5.2. In fact, for in-building systems, multipath effects are quite severe,
thus producing strong fast fading and the median path loss is used for system design.
In order to deﬁne the path loss properly, the losses and gains in the system must be
considered. The elements of a simple wireless link are shown in Figure 4.21 and are as
follows:
 Transmit power, PT. The amount of available power taken at the output of the
transmitter. This is expressed either in watts, milliwatts or picowatts, or in decibels:
dBm, dBW.

98
Indoor Wireless Communications
Figure 4.21 Elements of a wireless communication system.
 Feeder loss, LT. These losses account for cable and connector losses in the transmitter.
They are unitless or expressed in dB.
 Transmit antenna gain, GT. Gains are expressed either in dBi or dBd, if in decibels, or
are unitless.
 Path loss, L. The path loss units are dB.
 Receiver antenna gain, GR. Also expressed in dBi, dBd or unitless; this is the antenna
gain at the receiver end.
 Feeder loss, LR. These losses are referred to the receiver end and are taken between the
antenna and receiver; expressed in dB.
 Received power, PR. Expressed in milliwatts, watts or if in decibels: dBm, dBW.
 Effective isotropic transmitted power, PTI. This parameter refers to the power level
that is radiated from the antenna, in dBm or dBW, taking into account transmit
antenna gain and cable losses, as follows:
PTI  PT  GT  LT
(4.32)
Note that all parameters in uppercase are expressed in decibels. Another way to call PTI
is as an effective isotropic radiated power, or EIRP. This term is more popular for radio
communications and is extensively used for terrestrial and satellite systems.
 Effective isotropic received power, PRI. Power received at the antenna, before taking
into consideration receive antenna gain or cable losses:
PRI  PR  LR  GR
(4.33)
Having the effective isotropic radiated and received powers, it is possible to obtain the
total path loss from PTI and PRI as follows:
L  PTI  PRI
(4.34)
The elements presented in Figure 4.21 are generic to any wireless system, including in-
building radio systems.
4.5.2
Link Budgets
A link budget is a procedure that is done to obtain the estimated received signal strength
in a wireless link, taking into account transmit power, gains and losses in the system.

99
4 Radio Propagation
Thus, from Figure 4.21, the received power PR can be calculated taking into account all
gains and losses in the system:
Received power  Transmitted power  Gains  Losses
(4.35)
When designing an indoor wireless system, one of the main requirements (as seen in
Chapter 3) is to estimate its range for given system parameters (antenna gains, cable and
feeder losses, transmit power, etc.). Since most of these parameters can be known, the
path loss must be estimated as accurately as possible, as it depends on the propagation
environment - reﬂections, refractions, diffraction, scattering and waveguiding affect the
way in which the signal propagates inside the building. Therefore, to predict the path loss
as accurately as possible is one of the main goals of an in-building radio designer,
allowing the range of a radio system to be determined before installation. The path loss
can be simply computed by rearranging the link budget equation, depicted in equation
(4.35), to determine the path loss corresponding to a given received power:
L  PT  LT  GT  PR  GR  LR
(4.36)
For indoor scenarios, link budgets are often constructed based on the speciﬁc distribu­
tion system in use. Losses are accounted for in a different way, as active distribution
systems usually compensate for such losses with the use of ampliﬁcation. Examples of
indoor link budgets will be given in Chapter 11, where case studies are examined, since
distribution systems need to be introduced, which is done until Chapter 9. For now, let us
focus on the basics ﬁrst to understand the 'full picture' and be able to use this knowledge
later on.
4.5.3
Receiver Sensitivity
When the received power falls beyond a certain threshold level, which provides just
acceptable communication quality, the wireless link is said to be right at the edge of
coverage. This minimum received signal strength is known as receiver sensitivity and is
used in link budgets to estimate coverage range based on parameters such as: frequency,
base station antenna height, transmit power, antenna gains, etc.
For example, for GSM cellular systems, this receiver sensitivity is around 104 dBm.
This means that a dropped call due to a low signal strength level may occur if the received
signal goes beyond this threshold; for example 106 dBm.
4.5.4
Maximum Acceptable Path Loss (MAPL)
A very useful parameter used to delimit the range of a wireless system is known as the
maximum acceptable path loss (MAPL). The maximum range of such a system occurs
when the received power falls beyond the given receiver sensitivity. Thus, the value of a
path loss for which this power is received is the MAPL, expressed in decibels.
Note that as a consequence of the reciprocity theorem, the deﬁnition of the path loss
is unaltered by swapping the roles of transmit and receive antennas, provided that
the frequency is maintained and the medium does not vary with time. However, the
maximum acceptable propagation loss may be different in the two directions, as the
applicable losses and sensitivities may be different. For example, a base station receiver is

100
Indoor Wireless Communications
usually designed to be more sensitive than the mobile, to compensate for the reduced
transmit power available from the mobile.
The speciﬁc value of MAPL is very dependent on the technology used and the
coverage and signal quality requirements of the particular project. However, it would be
very unusual for it to be outside the range of 70  150 dB.
4.5.5
Free-Space Loss
Free-space loss (FSL) is the minimum path loss experienced between two antennas,
assuming free-space conditions are given between the two points. To understand the
mechanism upon which free-space loss is deﬁned, let us examine a point source
(antenna) producing radio waves. Power radiates equally in all directions and is spread
over the surface of a sphere, so the power available in an antenna of a ﬁxed size decreases
with the square of the distance. This is known as the inverse square law and is very easy to
verify experimentally.
Additionally, the gain of a ﬁxed size of antenna increases linearly with wavelength (or
it is inversely proportional to frequency). Since this affects both transmit and receive
antennas, the power also decreases with the square of frequency.
To compute free-space loss, the Friis equation is used, which takes into account the
antenna gains. If the gains are not considered, a more useful expression in decibels for
the free-space loss LFSL is used, as follows:
4πrf
LFSL  20 log
(4.37)
c
In (4.37), f is the frequency in Hz and r is the distance between the transmitter and
receiver in metres.
For in-building scenarios, free-space loss can only be assumed for very short distances
between transmit and receive antennas, since clutter and objects are normally close to
either side of the link and within the ﬁrst Fresnel zone radius, thus causing multipath or
diffraction. An example of this is when the transmit power of a Wi-Fi access point is to be
calculated, for which a laptop is brought close to it (1.5 m) and the received signal is
recorded; for example suppose 23 dBm. Since the antenna gains of transmit and receive
antennas are known (2 dBi and 0 dBi, respectively), the free-space loss is calculated as
4π  2:4  109  1:5
LFSL  20 log
 43:6 dB
3  108
Therefore, using the link budget equation (4.35) and rearranging for transmit power yields
PT  PR  GT  LFSL  GR  23  2  43:6  0  18:6 dBm
pT  10PT=10  1018:6=10  72:4 mW
4.5.6
Excess Loss
As free-space loss is the minimum path loss experienced between two antennas under
normal conditions, as deﬁned in Section 4.5.5, it will be expected that for most
conditions and situations, FSL could be taken as this true minimum. However, there
are exceptions for effects like waveguiding (Section 4.3.7), where the total path loss is

101
4 Radio Propagation
actually less than that of free-space loss - this effect can be explained as multiple
reﬂections occurring, say, on the walls of corridors or as enclosed spaces adding
coherently and contributing to the received signal strength, seeing the effect as a
'waveguiding gain'. This is a very special case and, until now, there is nothing else
reported that may follow this behaviour.
All additional losses to the 'minimum' free-space loss are called 'excess losses'. Since
free-space loss only takes into account frequency and distance, the excess loss considers
other propagation effects, especially inside buildings, such as diffraction, wall and ﬂoor
losses and scattering. In mathematical terms, the excess loss Lex is given by
Lex  L  LFSL
(4.38)
In other words, the excess loss can be computed if the total path loss L is known, and
information about transmit-receive distance as well as frequency is available. In Chapter 5
we will see that many of these propagation effects are taken into consideration in the
indoor propagation models, and some of them add these factors to the free-space loss.
4.6
Fast Fading
In a wireless channel, the noise sources that affect it can be subdivided into multiplicative
and additive effects. The additive noise arises from noise generated within the receiver
itself, such as thermal and shot noise in passive and active components, and also from
external sources, such as atmospheric effects, cosmic radiation and interference from
other transmitters and electrical appliances. The multiplicative noise arises from the
various processes encountered by transmitted waves on their way from the transmitter
antenna to the receiver antenna.
It is conventional to further subdivide the multiplicative processes in the channel into
three types of fading: path loss, shadowing (or slow fading) and fast fading (or multipath
fading), which appear as time-varying processes between the antennas. All of these
processes vary as the relative positions of the transmitter and receiver change and as any
contributing objects or materials between the antennas are moved.
In Section 4.5.1 we discussed the median path loss, which is often used as the main
parameter for wireless radio design. However, the two other multiplicative processes are
very relevant and should not be underestimated. Fast fading is discussed here, leaving the
slow fading deﬁnition for Section 4.7.
Fast fading is normally characterized by rapid signal variations on the scale of half-
wavelength and frequently introduces variations as large as 35 to 40 dB. It results from
the constructive and destructive interference between multiple waves reaching the
mobile from the indoor base station, as depicted in Figure 4.22. This type of fading is also
known as multipath fading.
For indoor scenarios, multipath strongly inﬂuences the behaviour of the signal
strength, as the mobile moves away from the base station. An example of fast fading
affecting propagation inside a building is shown in Figure 4.23, where thousands of signal
strength samples were collected in a university library building at 872 MHz.
Figure 4.24 shows the environment where the samples were collected. Notice that this
ﬂoor has many bookshelves and desks for students, which create strong multipath effects
that produce variations of around 30 dB, as shown in Figure 4.23.

During system design, fast fading is often removed by ﬁltering, as an additional
allowance of system resources is made to overcome deep fades.
4.7
Shadowing (Slow Fading)
Median path loss does not consider the fact that the surrounding environmental clutter
may be vastly different at two different locations having the same transmitter-receiver
separation. This leads to measured signals that are vastly different than the median path
loss of Section 4.5.1. Shadowing is a zero-mean log-normally distributed random variable
(Gaussian in dB), which describes the random effects that occur over a large number of
measurement locations that have the same transmitter-receiver separation but different
levels of clutter on the propagation path.
For indoor environments, shadowing arises due to the varying nature of the particular
obstructions between the base station and the mobile, such as particularly tall pieces of
furniture or partitions within a room, or simply the speciﬁc layout of the building, as
depicted in Figure 4.25.
Failure to take shadowing into account while predicting path loss can result in areas of
a building wrongly predicted. Those areas with less predicted path loss would produce
outage spots for which coverage levels will be less than the required levels. On the other
hand, if path loss is predicted in excess, predictions would dictate that signal strength
values will be less than in reality and thus interference to other cells or systems is prone
to occur. Both scenarios are shown in Figure 4.26, in comparison with a full prediction of
the same area considering shadowing.
The standard deviation of the shadowing is known as location variability and normally
has higher reported values than those of macrocellular environments. It is usual to model
shadowing in indoor environments as lognormal, just as in other environments.
However, there is some evidence that the location variability is itself more environ­
ment-dependent. Reported values span from 3 to 15 dB, which depend on frequency and
environment (Fiacco et al., 2000).

4.8 Building Penetration Loss
Many efforts in characterizing the losses caused by building walls have been reported in
the literature, having contradictory conclusions and substantially different methodolo­
gies, something that makes a comparison amongst studies an almost impossible task.
One of the regulatory bodies in Europe that has performed a substantial amount of work
in this ﬁeld is Ofcom, the UK regulator, issuing reports and recommendations for
penetration losses. Ofcom's ﬁndings and approach will be taken in this section to discuss
how building penetration losses are characterized.
The Ofcom February 2009 mobile liberalization consultation (Ofcom, 2009) deﬁned
building penetration loss (BPL) as:
The difference (in decibels) between the median of the location variability of the
signal level at the building location, as predicted by the outdoor propagation
model, and the signal level inside the building at the same height above ground,
with multi-path fading spatially averaged for both signals.
The BPL is only one component of the overall propagation loss between a base station
and an (indoor) mobile device and all need to be considered to determine the overall
impact on network performance.
In practice, there are three key variables that determine the extent of BPL as follows
(Ofcom, 2012):
 Frequency
 Depth (or consistency) of penetration
 Building (or clutter) type.

105
4 Radio Propagation

shadowing; (b) predictions with shadowing.

106
Indoor Wireless Communications
These will be discussed in this section, but ﬁrst the relevant propagation mechanisms
involved in BPL need to be examined. An example of a consultation conducted by Ofcom
in 2009 is used for illustrating the variations of BPL across many frequencies.
4.8.1
Radio Wave Propagation into Buildings
The main propagation mechanisms of relevance are:
 Absorption loss due to penetration through bulk materials (e.g. solid, homogeneous
walls)
 Diffraction around edges (e.g. window frames, reinforcement rods, etc.)
 Scattering from rough surfaces and objects small compared with a wavelength (e.g.
furniture and rough walls)
 Multipath effects (e.g. from the combination of multiple reﬂections from internal
walls)
 Waveguide effects (e.g. along long, straight corridors).
These mechanisms exhibit different frequency dependencies, as follows (Ofcom,
2009):
 Loss through uniform external walls and metallized glass will increase with frequency.
 Loss through large apertures with minimal conductivity (plain glass windows) remains
unchanged with variations in frequency.
 Loss in regions dominated by diffraction and no line-of-sight increases with frequency.
 Losses through smaller windows may decrease with frequency if the wavelength is
comparable to the size; i.e. around 25 cm.
 Loss at particular points in the presence of a strong multipath may increase or
decrease with frequency over limited frequency ranges.
 Loss through internal walls and through ﬂoors will increase with frequency, giving
greater differences for a greater target in-building depths.
 Corridors may exhibit unusually low penetration loss, which either remains unaffected
by frequency or tends to decrease.
The balance between the mechanisms - and hence the overall frequency dependency
- will depend on the materials and geometry of the building in question as well as to a
lesser extent the geometry of the surrounding buildings and the relative placement of the
transmitter and receiver. Beyond this simple summary, it is important to recognize that
resonance and multipath effects mean that losses over a given range can be positively or
negatively dependent on frequency, even within a single mechanism.
4.8.2
Variations with Frequency
The Ofcom February 2009 mobile spectrum liberalization consultation (Ofcom, 2009)
provided an overview of the relevant propagation mechanisms and effects, concluding
that:
Any given building will be a mixture of these effects, so a large spread of values is
anticipated relative to the overall trend. Nevertheless, the general trend of
increasing loss with frequency arising from the skin effect and other mechanisms

suggests an overall trend to increase with frequency, particularly when the
penetration depth into a building is high. The frequency variation might thus
take the form of Figure 23 for any given building.
This Figure 23 cited above from Ofcom (2009) shows that path loss decreases with
frequency over a limited range, especially in a region termed wall cavity. At higher
frequencies there is another loss decrease peak arising from the skin effect, within a
region denoted as materials matching. Otherwise, the loss increase with frequency

follows a linear behaviour, as would be expected simply by applying the free-space loss
equation.
Despite this, there was a great effort to characterize the behaviour of BPL with
frequency by conducting extensive measurement campaigns; the overall ﬁnding was that
there was a clear trend for BPL to increase with frequency, but the variability of data
amongst buildings at a given frequency was substantially larger than the variation of the
mean with frequency. If some of this variation may also be due to methodological
differences amongst authors, the studies concluded that it was difﬁcult to assert a ﬁrm
value for the variation of losses in the mean.
4.8.3
Variations with Depth and Clutter
A new set of assumptions were created in Ofcom (2009). In contrast to the previous
work, these additionally varied with depth (to allow examination of shallower and deeper
penetration cases) and clutter type, as shown in Table 4.1.
4.8.4
Comparison of Assumptions Made by Ofcom
A summary of key cases of variations of BPL with frequency, depth and clutter are
illustrated in Table 4.2 (Ofcom, 2012). Note that the frequency exponent in this table is
based on the difference between the loss values in the widest frequency range included in
the assumptions, as follows:

Conclusion
Radio propagation inside buildings exhibits a more complex behaviour than in outdoor
environments, thus making it more difﬁcult to predict. We have started with the
fundamentals of electromagnetism to enable the reader to understand and comprehend
its origins. Maxwell's equations are much more than a frightening form of expressing
electromagnetic effects and constitute the basis of many practical devices and tech­
nologies today!
It has been seen that if some propagation mechanisms are not taken into account
while attempting to predict path loss, errors can be produced that affect system
performance - this applies both ways, either if the path loss is underestimated or
overestimated. Waveguiding is also typical of in-building scenarios and is often neglec­
ted or wrongly predicted.
An introduction to link budgets has also been presented, for which some modiﬁca­
tions are to be done when used in buildings. However, this is presented later on in the
book, when technologies to provide and distribute radio coverage inside buildings are
revised.
A deep understanding of the propagation mechanisms that affect link performance is
thus essential if path loss and/or signal strength is to be predicted inside buildings with

110
Indoor Wireless Communications
reasonable accuracy. The application of this knowledge in the construction of indoor
propagation models was discussed in Chapter 4.
Finally, the dependency of building penetration loss and in general the dependency of
transmission loss with frequency has been the study of researchers for many years.
However, there are relatively few studies that measure using the same measurement
approach across the range of frequencies of interest and over a large sample of buildings,
making it difﬁcult to compare directly between studies. Each study of building penetra­
tion loss is approached in a different manner. Some studies look to derive theoretical
models based on the physical properties of materials and then to tune these models using
precise measurement data of individual building materials. Other studies are purely
empirical, measuring a representative sample of real buildings and forming a conclusion
from these.
There is a great deal of variability in the approach as well as differences in the speciﬁc
buildings examined. As a consequence of this, the spread of values of BPL arising from
these studies is large. Some of the factors that will affect the outcome of BPL studies are,
for example:
 Cell type, for example macro versus micro
 Building types, for example ofﬁce building versus residential home
 Building location, for example isolated versus built-up area
 Penetration depth into building, for example external wall or deep inside
 Number of buildings surveyed
 Materials, for example isolated or part of a wall or part of a building.
Also, it has been found throughout the years that propagation loss changes depending
on the penetration depth inside the building. This is strongly related to the types of

researched.

Channel Modelling
Radio signals propagate in real indoor environments in all sorts of ways, since the in-
building channel is quite challenging in terms of speciﬁc objects affecting the electro­
magnetic wave, leading to the propagation effects presented in Chapter 4. For system
design and planning, it is essential to predict signal strength levels inside the building, as
well as other important parameters (e.g. power delay proﬁle) to guarantee system
performance and dimension required resources.
This chapter focuses on channel models and techniques often used for indoor wireless
systems, in order to provide useful tools that assist the engineer in the design of such
systems. Although most of the emphasis is given to narrowband models used to estimate
the local mean, a section to wideband channel modelling is included, since this is
important to determine to a great extent the maximum data rate that can be achieved in a
network.
5.1
The Importance of Channel Modelling
The basic parameters of antennas and radiating cables can be used together with an
understanding of propagation mechanisms to calculate the range of a wireless commu­
nication system. For this purpose, mathematical expressions or models are a useful way
to characterize the propagation phenomena for various environments, which can then be
applied in predicting signal strength for similar scenarios. Antennas and radiating cables
will be the subject of study for Chapter 6; indoor propagation models are presented in
this chapter.
Accurate models assist the system designer when performing predictions to assess the
expected coverage inside a building, while ensuring system performance as these
predictions are closely related to real values.
On the basis that the propagation models are correctly chosen, predictions can be
made quickly, even before visiting a building, and determine at a ﬁrst glance the expected
range of antennas and their potential locations. This applies to many wireless tech­
nologies and venues, although it becomes more useful for large buildings, where
hundreds of antennas need to be deployed (e.g. airports, shopping centres, stadiums,
etc.).
There are other cases in which predictions can be useful; for example, for areas where
measurements cannot be made - access restrictions to designated areas in many

buildings can result in having model predictions as the only choice for estimating radio
coverage.
Propagation models can also be used to predict signal strength or path loss everywhere
in a building and allow optimization of antenna locations without repeated measure­
ments. For example, an antenna can be 'moved' to a different location and by performing
a new prediction, on the basis that the model used is accurate enough; there is no need to
revisit the building and perform measurements for this new antenna location (this can be
quite handy especially if the building in consideration is 130 km away!).
5.2 Propagation Modelling Challenges
The modelling of any physical phenomenon in nature is in its own a challenging task.
Scientists and researchers have spent fairly large amounts of time establishing mathe­
matical models to describe how key physical mechanisms behave. Luckily for humanity,
this has led to extraordinary developments in science and technology, thanks to the fact
that once the model is available, experimentation is thus possible.
When a wireless system is to be deployed inside a building and modelling needs to be
performed, further challenges are encountered:
 Propagation models exhibit a large variability with design parameters such as
frequency, distance between transmitter and receiver, antenna heights, etc. This
means that some models account for these effects explicitly in their mathematical
expression and often are created having in mind parameter limitations; that is a
speciﬁc model can only be used within a certain frequency range and antenna heights.
 There is a large variability of buildings, materials, layouts, etc., which make indoor
models more difﬁcult to be applicable in a 'general' form and thus some of its
parameters need to be 'tunable'.
 Propagation effects inside buildings are quite complex and need to be taken into
account to improve model accuracy - this can be difﬁcult since in many cases it is hard
to separate them.
 Radio measurements are used for both model tuning and validation, which can in
principle be straightforward but in practice could represent further complications; for
example how could we perform post-design validation measurements with a full
stadium to account for spectators' body losses and reﬂections?
5.3 Model Classiﬁcation
Indoor propagation models can be classiﬁed into many categories depending on channel
characteristics, propagation environment, design approach, etc. These classiﬁcations are
brieﬂy presented and explained as follows.
5.3.1
Channel Bandwidth
Mobile radio systems for voice and low bit rate data applications can consider the
channel as having purely narrowband characteristics, but the wideband mobile radio

115
5 Channel Modelling
channel has assumed increasing importance in recent years as mobile data rates have
increased to support multimedia services. In non-mobile applications, such as television
and ﬁxed links, wideband channel characteristics have been important for a considerable
period.
In the narrowband channel, multipath fading comes about as a result of small path
length differences between rays coming from scatterers in the near vicinity of the mobile.
These differences, on the order of a few wavelengths, lead to signiﬁcant phase differ­
ences. Nevertheless, the rays all arrive at essentially the same time, so all frequencies
within a wide bandwidth are affected in the same way.
By contrast, if strong scatterers exist well off the great circle path between the base and
mobile, the time differences may be signiﬁcant. If the relative delays are large compared
to the basic unit of information transmitted on the channel (usually a symbol or a bit),
the signal will then experience signiﬁcant distortion, which varies across the channel
bandwidth. The channel is then a wideband channel and any models need to account for
these effects.
A very ﬁrst model classiﬁcation that can be done is according to the nature of the
radio channel: narrowband, if local mean and possibly shadowing is to be estimated,
and wideband, for power delay proﬁle and the characterisation of other relevant
parameters.
5.3.2
Propagation Environment
In addition to the nature of the channel (wideband or narrowband), a common approach
to classify propagation models is by taking into account the environment for which they
have been designed: outdoor, indoor (in-building) and outdoor-to-indoor. Our focus in
this book is mainly on indoor and outdoor-to-indoor models, which are extensively used
while designing in-building radio networks.
5.3.3
Model Construction Approach
Another classiﬁcation is made for models depending on the approach taken to construct
them: physical, if the model is based on underlying physics; empirical, if based on ﬁtting
functions to measurements; statistical, if based on random distributions; etc. The
decision as to which model should be used and where is based on a clear understanding
of what each the categories represent, and thus apply the models for real building
scenarios.
A comparison of advantages and disadvantages of empirical versus physical models is
presented in Table 5.1. In summary, while empirical models are simple and fast, they can
be used to estimate buildings in general and there is no need for detailed building data,
cannot guarantee accurate results for details, as well as strongly depend on a large
number of measurements. The building and environment classiﬁcation is hard, and, if
operating frequency is changed, there is a need for complete recalibration of the building
propagation model. Physical models ﬁll those deﬁciencies quite well, having a wide
parameter range, as well as producing details of the relation between path loss and angle
of arrival, multipath, etc. However, the electrical characteristics and detailed structure
are hard to capture accurately, making it difﬁcult to implement and taking a much longer
computational time.

5.4 Model Accuracy
Before going into depth to analyse the different in-building propagation models, it is
useful to deﬁne how the accuracy of a model can be evaluated and, based on this, select
the best model to be used or determine if the selected model was employed using
appropriate parameters.
The accuracy of a propagation model can be evaluated by checking some statistics of
the error results, which compares the predicted values given by the model with real
measurements at these points. The mean error μerror is often used for this, which is the
difference between the measured Li;measured and the predicted Li;predicted path loss, taking
into consideration all the samples N:
N
1

(5.1)
Li;measured  Li;predicted
μerror
N i1
For example, measured and predicted values of path loss are shown in Figure 5.1. Notice
that the solid line indicates a 'best ﬁt' of the measured data, hence having a mean of zero.
This is classiﬁed as a 'perfect model' in that it has been tuned to measurements as closely
as it can be. However, notice that a zero mean is not a measure of a perfect prediction; it
is the standard deviation of the error, which clearly shows how accurate the model ﬁts
the measurements, as positive and negative errors cancel out, thus forcing the mean to be
zero.

Figure 5.1 Measurements versus predictions.
The procedure employed to adjust model parameters with measurements so that ﬁrst-
order statistics of the prediction error (mean, standard deviation, correlation) are
minimized is called model tuning. A well-tuned model should have a mean very close
to zero, but careful interpretation should be made at this point since this does not
guarantee a minimum error. The standard deviation of the error σerror expresses the
average deviation irrespective of whether it is positive or negative, thus being a better
ﬁgure of merit for models:

Model tuning is described in more detail in Chapter 7, when radio measurements are
introduced and discussed.
5.5
Empirical Models
An empirical model is based directly on measured results and it is from these
measurements that model parameters of a simple equation are adjusted (tuned) to
provide a good ﬁt to results measured previously in similar environments. These models
are relatively easy to develop and implement, but are strongly dependent on the accuracy
of the measurements conducted to tune their parameters.
To create such a model, an extensive set of actual path loss measurements is made and
an appropriate function is ﬁtted to the measurements, with parameters derived for the
particular environment, frequency and other variables, so as to minimize the error
between the model and the measurements.
Empirical models provide no physical insight into the mechanisms by which propa­
gation occurs. An example of an empirical model is shown in Figure 5.2, where a line ﬁts

the measurements, which show a large variability (spread) given by the location
variability of the environment.
This section provides a review of some of the most popular empirical indoor models
used in practice, which have been developed throughout the years. Its use and
applicability is explained in each section, as well as the in-building technologies for
which they can be used.
5.5.1
Power Law Model
The power law model is considered to be the simplest form of an empirical path loss
model; that is the only two model parameters n and K are tuned with measurements. The
form of this model is
L  10n log r  K
(5.3)
The parameter K is also known as the path loss intercept, which represents the path loss
taken at a reference distance, often taken as 1 m. Parameter n is known as the path loss
exponent. These parameters depend on building materials, density of walls and fre­
quency. The distance between the transmit and receive antennas is r.
The path loss intercept is found empirically, having a distinct value for every building
and/or ﬂoor that is measured.
The path loss exponent has been found by measurement to depend on other system
parameters, such as antenna heights and speciﬁc clutter surrounding the environment.
For in-building systems and in dense clutter environments, it can take values of
anywhere from a little less than 2 (in unobstructed waveguiding situations, such as
corridors) to 5 or even more in very heavily obstructed environments. Values in the
range 2-4 are most common. The path loss exponent is a critical factor in establishing

5 Channel Modelling

the coverage and capacity of a cellular system, since it strongly affects the range and
therefore inﬂuences interference as well.
Figure 5.3 shows an example of a power law model ﬁtted to some measurements. The
straight line represents the best-ﬁt power law empirical model curve. The dots are the
measured data (after averaging out the fast fading). Note how the path loss exponent
represents the steepness of the best-ﬁt curve, showing how rapidly the signal decreases
with distance.
This model is not very important for real predictions since research has shown that
path loss behaviour inside buildings depends only on these two parameters. Never­
theless, it illustrates a number of points that will help in explaining the more practical
indoor models later. It also accounts for why a different approach is taken for macrocells
compared with in-building.
5.5.2
Keenan-Motley Model
The Keenan and Motley empirical model (Keenan and Motley, 1990) is usually taken as a
reference for in-building propagation work, as the Okumura-Hata model (Okumura
et al., 1968; Hata, 1980) is for macrocell predictions. The model characterizes indoor
path loss by a ﬁxed path loss exponent of 2, just as in free space, plus additional loss
factors relating to the number of ﬂoors nf and walls nw intersected by the straight-line
distance r between the terminals. Thus:
L  L1  20n log r  nf af  nwaw
(5.4)
where af and aw are the attenuation factors (in decibels) per ﬂoor and per wall,
respectively. L1 is the loss at r  1 m, also known as the path loss intercept, as deﬁned
in Section 5.5.1. Wall and ﬂoor factors are adjusted using measurements to minimize the
error between the model predictions and measurements.
Figure 5.4 shows an example of a prediction using the Keenan and Motley model.
Note that although some variability is obtained due to the use of wall factors and other

material characteristics, the model does not account well for shadowing variations due
to speciﬁc furniture around the site. Nevertheless, a reasonable accuracy can be
obtained, with reported standard deviations of the errors (measured versus predicted
values) between 5 and 8 dB, depending on the environment (Aragón-Zavala et al.,
2006).
Despite some of the limitations of the Keenan and Motley in-building propagation
model, it is very simple to implement and is often taken as a reference to compare the
accuracy of other more sophisticated models against - in a similar way that the
Okumura-Hata model is taken as a reference for macrocell predictions.
One of the main limitations the Keenan and Motley model has is the fact that it
averages all ﬂoor and wall losses, without being able to take into account individual
partition losses coming from different materials. This assumption brings errors in the
prediction that balance out when computing the mean of the error μerror, but are shown
when calculating the standard deviation of the error σerror.
On the other hand, even though the model can yield good results (statistically), it fails
to be accurate enough for some areas where path loss can be underestimated or
overestimated, hence causing either leakage or outage problems.
Finally, as observed in Figure 5.4, sharp signal transitions between zones correspond­
ing to different numbers of wall can be seen, which is clearly not accurate.

121
5 Channel Modelling
5.5.3
ITU-R Indoor Model
For this model, only the ﬂoor loss is accounted for explicitly and the loss between points
on the same ﬂoor is included implicitly by changing the path loss exponent (ITU, 1997).
The basic variation with frequency is assumed to be the same as in free space, producing
the following total path loss model (in decibels):
L  20 log f  10n log r  Lf
 28
(5.5)
nf
c
where n is the path loss exponent and Lf
is the ﬂoor penetration loss, which varies
with the number of penetrated ﬂoors nf . Recommended values for path loss exponents
are given in Table 5.2.
The 60 GHz ﬁgures apply only within a single room for distances less than around
100 m, since no wall transmission loss or gaseous absorption is included. Floor
penetration factors for this model are presented in Table 5.3.
The ITU-R model is very simple to implement and key parameters can be tuned
with measurements. Unlike the Keenan-Motley model, it attempts to model path loss
taking into account ﬂoor penetration losses, which make it more suitable for 3-D
scenarios.

On the other hand, the 'average' path loss exponents are supposed to take into account
variations with wall penetration losses, but it is this averaging process that can make it
very inaccurate for larger areas with multiple partitions made of a fairly large variety of
materials. It is somehow an indoor power law model, which could work reasonably well
for simple building geometries but not for more complex scenarios.
5.5.4
Siwiak-Bertoni-Yano (SBY) Multipath-Based Model
This model (Siwiak, Bertoni and Yano, 2003) is based on the assumption that, on average,
as the wave expands in a cluttered environment, it attenuates due to several propagation
mechanisms generating multipath components whose behaviour can be predicted. In
addition to the inverse-square path loss, the wave additionally sheds energy into time in
the form of multipath reﬂections. This shedding of energy into multipath was measured
by the authors by delay spread, which increases with propagation distance. Thus the
model can be expressed as free-space propagation modiﬁed by a multipath scattering
term:
2
c
n2
rt=r
1  e
(5.6)
L  10 log

For in-building scenarios, n is taken as 3. The SBY model predicts free-space propagation
that transitions to the inverse n-power law beyond a breakpoint distance rt. For r  rt,

the modifying term reduces to 1=r n2, which, combined with the free-space term, yields
an overall power law of n.
It seems to take into account multipath associated with the indoor propagation
channel and it is relatively simple to implement. It can be applied for both a power delay
proﬁle and path loss propagation predictions.
It does neither take into account absorption due to lossy materials nor losses due to
polarization cross-coupling in the propagation path. The model was created having in
mind UWB propagation, and although the authors claim that it can be applied to
narrowband systems, no evidence of this has been found in the literature.
5.5.5
Ericsson Multiple Breakpoint Model
The Ericsson radio system model was obtained by measurements in a multiple-ﬂoor
ofﬁce building (Akerberg, 1988). The model has four breakpoints and considers both an
upper and a lower bound on the path loss. The model also assumes that there is 30 dB
attenuation at 1 m, which can be shown to be accurate for a frequency of 900 MHz and
unity-gain antennas. Rather than assuming a lognormal shadowing component, the
Ericsson model provides a deterministic limit on the range of path loss at a particular
distance.
Although intended to be used around 900 MHz, the model can be extended to
1800 MHz by the addition of 8.5 dB extra path loss at all distances. The model is shown in
Table 5.4.
Implementation of this model is very simple and therefore predictions can be made
very fast. Some of the model parameters can be tuned with measurements very easily if
the range needs to be extended. On the other hand, the frequency range over which the

model is valid is fairly limited (900-1800 MHz) and since it is a power law model, it
requires a very large amount of measurements to have reasonable accuracy.
5.5.6
Tuan Empirical Indoor Model: 900 MHz to 5.7 GHz
In one empirical model for use at Wi-Fi frequencies (Tuan et al., 2003), the path loss has
the general form:
L  k1  k2 log f  k3 log r  nwk4P1  k5P2  k6nf
(5.7)
c
P1 and P2 are associated with the angle of incidence θ to a wall. Various forms of P1 and
P2 were proposed in Tuan et al. (2003), and after validating the model with measure­
ments, the path loss is given by
L  19:07  37:3 log f  18:3 log r  nw

21 sin θ  12:2 1  sin θ  8:6nf
c
(5.8)
This model is given as valid for a frequency range between 900 MHz and 5.7 GHz and
can be used in ofﬁce environments, although the authors do not explicitly recommend
other types of scenarios.
In general, a path loss equation of the form given here can be tuned with measure­
ments conducted at the frequency of interest. The unknown coefﬁcients k1 to k6 can be
computed using linear regression from the measured data.
The model attempts to take into account key propagation mechanisms through
measurements and key parameters can be tuned using measurements. There is a
frequency dependency and wall and ﬂoor factors are considered as well. The frequency
range over which the model is valid is also an advantage. It is also very easy to implement.
The authors do not show clear evidence of the validity of the model for frequencies
below 2.4 GHz. Also, as diffraction and reﬂections are not explicitly considered (just
through measurements), very inaccurate results could be produced at large distances or
for speciﬁc buildings.
5.5.7
Attenuation Factor Model
An in-building site-speciﬁc propagation model that includes the effect of building type as
well as the variations caused by obstacles was described in Seidel and Rappaport (1992).

124
Indoor Wireless Communications
The attenuation factor model is given by
L  L1m  10nSFlog r  FAF 
PAF
(5.9)
where nSF represents the exponent value for the same ﬂoor measurement, FAF
represents a ﬂoor attenuation factor for a speciﬁed number of building ﬂoors and
PAF represents the partition attenuation factor for a speciﬁc obstruction encountered by
a ray drawn between the transmitter and receiver in 3-D. Notice that partitions here
represent walls in the building, but are given this deﬁnition to include those that are not
necessarily walls; for example large ofﬁce buildings with soft partitions. L1m is the path
loss intercept.
This technique of drawing a single ray between the transmitter and receiver is called
primary ray tracing. Summing the cumulative partition losses along the primary ray has
been shown to yield good results and accuracy, according to the authors. Therefore, if a
good estimate of n exists, either selected from previously published results or from
measurements on the same ﬂoor, then the path loss on a different ﬂoor can be predicted
by adding an appropriate value of FAF (either selected from previous results or from
measurements) and then summing the partition losses selected from wall loss databases
or tuned with measurements.
There is an alternative way of writing the attenuation factor model, in which FAF is
replaced by an exponent that already considers the effects of multiple ﬂoor separation,
nMF, based on measurements through multiple ﬂoors:
L  L1m  10nMFlog r 
PAF
(5.10)
The attenuation factor model is very simple to implement. It is essential to have a
very complete database for materials characteristics, especially if predictions are to
be made without prior measurements. Otherwise, it is relatively easy to ﬁnd wall and
ﬂoor attenuation factors for different walls. Predictions can also be performed very
fast.
In terms of limitations of the model, it does not take into account either diffraction or
reﬂections (waveguiding), which could lead to inaccurate predictions. Also, being an
empirical model, the accuracy of the predictions is strongly inﬂuenced by the areas
where measurements are taken.
5.5.8
Indoor Dominant Path Model (DPM)
The dominant path model (DPM) (Wölﬂe et al., 2005) is an empirical approach for
predicting path loss for different environments, one of which is indoors. It is based on the
assumption that the majority of energy from the transmitter to the receiver is trans­
ported along a so-called dominant path, in contrast to other methods for which they
either only assume direct-ray contributions (ITU, 1997; Seidel and Rappaport, 1992) or
most of the ray contributions are considered, even those that correspond to rays heavily
attenuated and that do not necessarily represent a signiﬁcant contribution to the overall
ﬁeld strength (Cheung, Sau and Murch, 1998; Lee, Nix and McGeehan, 201; Seidel and
Rappaport, 1994). Thus, the DPM focuses on the dominant signal path, neglecting other
paths that are highly attenuated and do not contribute to the overall ﬁeld strength. Often
only a single path is taken, although for some special cases more than one is considered.

Figure 5.5 Model comparison: multiwall, ray tracing and DPM models.
It also provides a good compromise between the speed/simplicity of a multiwall model
and the potential accuracy of ray tracing.
Figure 5.5 shows a comparison of DPM with multiwall and ray tracing models. For
multiwall modelling approaches, direct ray contributions are taken into account,
neglecting other essential effects such as diffraction and hence making the prediction
of path loss rather pessimistic. On the other hand, for optical ray tracing, all possible rays
from the transmitter and the receiver are considered, thus increasing the complexity and
the computational time to unacceptable levels.

intercept, used here as an 'offset' for the calibration of the model. The summation

tions and diffractions for the m rays, whereas Lk corresponds to accumulated
transmission loss of k walls passed. The last term, Ω is the waveguiding gain, which
is empirically derived and taken as an extra gain margin due to multiple reﬂections in
corridors (waveguiding effect).
The model combines characteristics of power law, Keenan and Motley and ray-tracing
models. Although layout plans of walls of speciﬁed material and dimensions are required
in preparation of the use of the DPM model, these do not need to be as accurate as for
traditional in-building ray-tracing models. This makes the preparation materials process
much simpler than that for a full ray-tracing algorithm. Also, no exact location of the
diffraction and reﬂection points is necessary for the determination of the path, which
accelerates the processing of the diffracted paths, which is normally the most time-
consuming task.
In terms of accuracy, although it neglects some of the ﬁelds contributed by secondary
paths, the assumption that the most signiﬁcant path is the one that contributes the most
brings a maximum error in the prediction of 3 dB (in a very worst-case scenario).

Indoor Wireless Communications
Finally, key propagation mechanisms are taken into account, such as diffraction,
transmission losses (implicitly accounted for in the equation) and reﬂections (by the use
of the empirically derived waveguiding term). Also, execution time according to authors
is comparable to empirical models, and much less than ray tracing.
Reported results of the use of DPM show that the model does not perform very well in
curved edges and surfaces, since reﬂections on cylindrical surfaces are not considered.
Also, computation speed as reported in AWE Communications GmbH (2007) is larger
than for full ray tracing for some scenarios.
On the other hand, the way reﬂections are modelled through the use of an empirical
factor for waveguding just adds an offset to the overall prediction, which can give
reasonable but only limited results in corridors.
Shadowing is not implemented at all in the DPM, which for the case of indoor
environments, could represent an important propagation effect to take into considera­
tion, especially in densely cluttered buildings, where the statistical compliance assess­
ments may not be enough for critical areas where coverage is essential.

COST-231 Multiwall Model
A better approach to empirical in-building models is to use wall and ﬂoor losses for
individual partitions, as suggested in the COST-231 multi-wall model (COST-231,
1999). This model of propagation within buildings was created in a European research
collaborative project known as COST-231 (Collaboration in Science and Technology,
project 231). It incorporates a linear component of loss, proportional to the number of
walls penetrated, plus a more complex term that depends on the number of ﬂoors
penetrated, producing a loss that increases more slowly as additional ﬂoors after the ﬁrst
are added:
nf 2=nf 1b
L  LFSL  Lc 
Lwinwi  Lf nf
(5.12)
where LFSL is the free-space loss for the straight-line (direct) path between the
transmitter and receiver; nwi is the number of walls crossed by the direct path of
type i; W is the number of wall types; Lwi is the penetration loss for a wall of type i; nf is
the number of ﬂoors crossed by the path; b and Lc are empirically derived constants that
can be tuned with measurements; and Lf is the loss per ﬂoor.
The scenario for the multiwall model is depicted in Figure 5.6. Note that the model
only accounts for the direct path between the transmitter and the receiver, and wall
losses are added as extra losses to the minimum free-space loss factor. If multiple-ﬂoor
penetration takes place, then the ﬂoor loss factor Lf i is considered (not the case for
Figure 5.6).
The ﬂoor loss, that is the last term in (5.12) for the COST-231 multiwall model, is
shown in Figure 5.7. Note that the additional loss per ﬂoor decreases with the increasing
number of ﬂoors, due to diffracted waves coming from inside the building and being
reﬂected in contiguous buildings, coming back into the building through windows. In
other words, it is clear that two regimes are present; for small spacing between the
transmitter and receiver within the building, the signal drops rapidly as the multiple-
ﬂoor losses on a direct path between the transmitter and the receiver accumulate.

Figure 5.6 COST-231 multiwall model scenario.
Eventually the diffracted paths outside the building, discussed previously, dominate, and
these diminish far less quickly with distance. When a reﬂecting adjacent building is
present, the diffraction losses associated with this path are less and this provides a
signiﬁcant increase in the ﬁeld strength for large separations.
Some recommended values are Lw  1:9 dB (900 MHz), 3.4 dB (1800 MHz) for light
walls, 6.9 dB (1800 MHz) for heavy walls, Lf  14:8 dB (900 MHz), 18.3 dB (1800 MHz)
and b  0:46. The Lc term can be useful in ﬁtting to measured data, but is generally close
to zero.
Note that the losses found from ﬁtting are not necessarily simply the penetration
losses of individual walls and ﬂoors, but are results of all the mechanisms taking place in
the environment interacting together.A graphical representation where floor loss [dB] is plotted on the y-axis on a scale of 0-80 and number of floors on the x-axis on a scale of 1-8.

An example of the use of the COST-231 multiwall model is shown in Figure 5.8, for
two antennas located in a building for which wall losses have been modelled according to
(5.12).
Some of the main issues associated with the COST-231 multiwall model, which can be
seen as limitations on the use of it, can be summarized as below:
 Individual material properties can be selected for each wall, which leads to better
accuracy than Keenan and Motley model.
 No attempt to account for reﬂections or diffraction is made; only wall and ﬂoor
penetration is considered, which will tend to overestimate the path loss.
 Large database of penetration losses for different building materials is needed, and for
various frequencies, or retuning for each frequency and building type.
 No account for challenging environments like corridors, atriums, etc., is made in the
model.
These issues make the COST-231 multiwall model a simple and easy-to-use option for
path loss predictions inside buildings, which can be tuned with measurements and
provide reasonable accuracy, as long as the limitations of the model are well understood.
5.6 Physical Models
A physical model accounts directly for the important propagation mechanisms, given a
description of the geometry and electrical properties of the environment. In a physical
model, propagation mechanisms such as reﬂection, refraction, diffraction and others are
taken into account when computing the signal strength at any point. We will examine

129
5 Channel Modelling
various physical model approaches in this section, which have been widely used for
indoor wireless communication systems.
5.6.1
Introduction to Ray Tracing
One of the most popular physical model methods to predict path loss used for indoor
scenarios is known as ray tracing. Ray tracing is a sophisticated approach to determi­
nistic physical prediction of in-building propagation. This can be used for site-speciﬁc
predictions, provided that sufﬁcient detail of the building geometry and materials is
available. Building materials often need to be modelled in detail as multiple-layer
structures with detailed internal construction to achieve high modelling accuracy.
Fine detail of building geometry must also be obtained to account for the wave
interactions with walls, ﬂoors and the edges of doors and windows. In fact, ray tracing
takes into account building characteristics, such as walls and inclined and cylindrical
surfaces, as shown in Figure 5.9(a), and predicts how radio waves will propagate.
In Figure 5.9(b) it is shown how ray tracing has been applied to a building with a large
corridor and many rooms on both sides. The areas that have increased signal power due
to reﬂection are clearly shown there. For this simulation, details of speciﬁc furniture
inside the building were not available and therefore the rooms are assumed to be 'empty',
as can be clearly observed. A directional antenna was placed on the West corridor.
To perform ray tracing, all possible ray paths between the source and ﬁeld points
should be calculated, which are consistent with Snell's laws of reﬂection and refraction
and including diffracted rays (Saunders and Aragón-Zavala, 2007). The following steps
are followed:
 Ray launching sends out test rays at a number of discrete angles from the transmitter.
 The rays interact with objects present in the environment as they propagate.
 Launch new reﬂected, refracted and diffracted rays whenever a ray hits a surface or
edge.
 Use reﬂection, transmission and diffraction coefﬁcients to ﬁnd the ray power after
each 'bounce'.
 Add the power in all rays in a given area.

horizontal, cylindrical and other surfaces often modelled; (b) signal prediction using ray tracing.

130
Indoor Wireless Communications
Ray tracing correctly accounts for all the important propagation mechanisms (reﬂec­
tion, refraction, diffraction) on the assumption that there is good knowledge of the
building geometry and materials. It can be more accurate provided that the environment
information is available and correct.
Despite all of the above-mentioned beneﬁts, ray tracing tends to be computation-
ally slow when there is an increase in resolution and/or complexity of the
modelling environment, hence making it impractical for some in-building design
scenarios.
The following assumptions are often made when performing ray tracing predictions:
 Each wall is modelled as a plane surface.
 Each surface has known, simple electromagnetic properties (penetration, reﬂection,
diffraction).
 However, walls are rarely consistent materials and windows are complicated!
Various in-building models have incorporated ray-tracing algorithms and will be
presented here.
5.6.2
Honcharenko-Bertoni Model
A theoretical in-building ray-tracing model was developed by Honcharenko and Bertoni
(Honcharenko et al., 1992). They state that radio propagation is governed by two
principal mechanisms: attenuation due to walls and diffraction from obstacles near the
ﬂoor and in the plenum, with additional diffraction around the corners. The signal
diffracts from a cluttered region in the plenum of a building and a cluttered region near
the ﬂoor.
There is a clear space of height W c metres between the two cluttered regions, as seen
in Figure 5.10. The diffraction factor for wave propagation in a building with a clear space
W c results in excess loss compared with a free-space path. Rays are drawn between the
transmitter and the receiver, with transmission and reﬂection coefﬁcients attached to
rays that, respectively, pass through and are reﬂected by walls.Figure depicting the geometry for the Honcharenko-Bertoni ray-tracing model.

where ri is the distance connecting the ith ray between the transmitter and the receiver.
The ray undergoes n reﬂections Γn from walls and m transmissions T m through walls. In
addition, the ith ray is subjected to a distance-dependent loss Le in excess of free-space
loss due to diffraction from clutter near the ﬂoor and in the plenum. The diffraction loss
factor is unity for small distances ri and approaches an inverse 9.5 power with distance
behaviour for large distances in an ofﬁce building, according to Honcharenko et al.
(1992). The breakpoint between the extreme behaviours of Le is dependent on the clear
space parameter W c; for example 30 m at 900 MHz in an ofﬁce environment where W c
ranges between 1.5 m and 2 m.
Diffraction around corners needs to be taken into account for more accurate results.
Therefore, each corner at which the ray is diffracted is taken as an absorbing screen and
the ﬁeld reaching the receiving site via diffracted paths is given as

This model can give more accurate results provided that building details are speciﬁed, as
well as whether constitutive parameters of materials are known for the frequencies of
interest. It takes diffraction into account.
The main drawback for ray tracing is the computational time and complexity the
predictions may take. This is acceptable for research work, but for a propagation
prediction tool could be inappropriate.
5.6.3
Ray-Tracing Site-Speciﬁc Model
Site-speciﬁc models, also called deterministic models, are based on the theory of
electromagnetic wave propagation. Unlike statistical models, site-speciﬁc propagation
models do not rely on propagation measurements, but on knowledge of greater detail of
the environment, and they provide accurate predictions of the signal propagation.
A geometrical-optics based model to predict propagation within buildings of this
kind is presented in Seidel and Rappaport (1994). This ray-tracing algorithm predicts
multipath impulse responses based on building blueprints. The authors use an


132
Indoor Wireless Communications
AutoCAD format to import building details from ﬂoorplans, leaving only objects
whose size is much larger than a wavelength (large objects) in the database. It is
claimed by the authors that the model can predict path loss with an overall standard
deviation of less than 5 dB, and the power delay proﬁle statistics can also be obtained
with high accuracy.
The ray-tracing site-speciﬁc model uses geometrical optics to trace the propagation of
direct, reﬂected and transmitted ﬁelds. Singly diffracted ﬁelds are also computed. This
prediction technique uses 'brute-force ray tracing', for which a bundle of transmitted
rays is considered, which may or may not reach the receiver. The transmitter and
receiver are modelled as point sources in the building, and all possible angles of arrival
and departure are considered. Antenna patterns are incorporated to include the effects
of antenna beamwidth in both azimuth and elevation. A detailed description of how the
rays are traced is included in Seidel and Rappaport (1994).
The complex ﬁeld amplitude of the ith ray at the receiver is given by

 are the reﬂection and
transmission coefﬁcients, Ei is the ﬁeld strength of the ith multipath component in V/m,
E0 is the reference ﬁeld strength, in V/m and e jkr represents the propagation phase
factor due to path length (k  2π=λ).
This model takes into account all relevant propagation mechanisms affecting indoor
radio propagation and, as reported by the authors, this is certainly observed in the
error statistics shown, particularly in terms of the standard deviation of the error. It
also makes use of available building information from AutoCAD drawings, a standard
practice nowadays, which is also implemented in many in-building prediction software
tools. Finally, the use of effective building properties to characterize walls and other
partitions, as stated by the authors, often simplify the implementation and use of the
model.
Brute-force ray tracing is extremely computationally demanding, which anticipates
longer computational times than the current dominant-path model (DPM) algorithm,
which only takes into account a dominant path based on artiﬁcial intelligence techniques
for deciding this. Variations in the way dominant rays are chosen could be a solution, but
may require additional work.
5.6.4
Lee Ray-Tracing Model
A deterministic spatiotemporal propagation model has been proposed in Lee,
Nix and McGeehan (2001) based on ray launching techniques. Ray launching
sends out test rays at a number of discrete angles from the transmitter. The rays
interact with objects present in the environment as they propagate. The propagation
of a ray is therefore terminated when its power falls below a predeﬁned threshold.
The model considers reﬂection, transmission and diffraction effects via UTD
(uniform theory of diffraction) principles. Transmission and diffraction are consid­
ered in this model.

diffraction coefﬁcient and the spreading attenuation for the lth diffraction and e jkr is the
propagation phase factor, where r is the unfolded ray path length and k is the wave-
number. This model includes diffraction effects and is generalized to multiple inter­
actions, which are added to the reﬂections and transmissions for all possible rays
accounted for in GTD (geometrical theory of diffraction).
This model has been used with full three-dimensional data for both power delay and
power azimuth proﬁles, departure and arrival angles, and coverage predictions, as
detailed in Lee, Nix and McGeehan (2001). It is more accurate than statistical or
empirical models as it takes into account electromagnetic theory effects (diffraction,
transmission, reﬂection). However, this accuracy strongly depends on building geometry
details and material characteristics. As a full ray-tracing algorithm, it is complex and
takes a fairly large amount of computer resources, which will take the prediction time to
unacceptable levels.
5.6.5
Multichannel Coupling (MCC) Prediction
As stated in Section 5.6.1, one of the most popular deterministic methods for indoor
propagation modelling using geometric optics is ray tracing, where the propagation of a
ray is followed from the transmitter to a receiver along every path that exactly fulﬁls the
required angle condition for transmission and reﬂection. The main effort in this method
is the search for valid paths. Increasing the number of calculated reﬂections increases the
complexity drastically. The computationally expensive search for paths has to be redone
for each combination of transmitter and receiver location.
Another popular method is known as ray launching, where the rays are launched in
multiple directions from the transmitter. At their ﬁrst interaction with an object they are
split, for example, into the reﬂected and transmitted rays. These rays are propagated to
the next obstacle. There they are split again, etc. The computational effort for this is also
very demanding, with the very big disadvantage that the geometrical information of the
building has to be processed for each new transmitter position.
Although ray tracing has proven to be a very accurate method, its computational time
has made it difﬁcult to be incorporated in a planning tool, which aims to perform some
sort of optimization process, for which ideal locations for transmitters need to be found
in order to make a more efﬁcient use of the radio resources.
A new method was proposed by Dersch, Liebendörfer and Zehnder (2000), called
multichannel coupling (MCC), which, by performing a preprocessing of the building
geometry, allows a rapid propagation prediction thereafter, thus allowing the replace­
ment of transmitters fairly quickly and optimization to be performed much more
efﬁciently.

134
Indoor Wireless Communications
For this method, the ﬁrst task is the identiﬁcation of features of the realistic
environment relevant for the propagation of electromagnetic waves. The propagation
environment is described as a set of two-dimensional rectangular surface elements,
arbitrarily oriented in a 3-D space. Each element is assumed to have homogeneous
thickness and material properties. These elements Ai usually represent walls, doors,
windows, iron bookshelves, conducting blackboards and other objects with a strong
inﬂuence on the propagation.
Each pair of elements
that can directly exchange electromagnetic energy by at
least one line-of-sight (LOS) path deﬁnes a geometric propagation channel. The channel
Ai; Aj
is the set of all LOS paths conducting from element Ai to element Aj. This is
distinct from channel β Aj ! Ai
α Ai ! Aj
, which contains the paths with inverse direction. The
model for the physical environment is then an assembly of elements interconnected by
channels. Each element has transmission, reﬂection and scattering properties and each
channel has a geometrical shape and some propagation characteristics.
The following step in the MCC is the deﬁnition of the signal ﬂux that will be
propagated through the channels. Different partial contributions of the signal can be
superimposed linearly. If a signal that emerges from an element Ai within a channel α is
followed (Figure 5.11), it falls at the end of channel α on to an element Aj; where it is split
into two different parts. One part is absorbed at Aj. Another part is transmitted and
leaves element Aj within another channel β towards a third element Ak. Yet another part
perhaps is reﬂected at Aj and falls into a channel γ in front of Aj. These splittings are
described in Dersch, Liebendörfer and Zehnder (2000) by coupling coefﬁcients between
the channels:
Pβ  cαβPα
(5.18)Figure depicting MCC model power splitting.
Figure 5.11 MCC model power splitting.

135
5 Channel Modelling
where Pα is the power leaving the channel α at element Aj and Pβ represents the power
leaving the channel β at element Ak. The coefﬁcient cαβ couples these two signal rates,
containing information of how much energy coming from element Ai reaches element
Ak by transmission, reﬂection or scattering at element Aj. The calculation of such
coupling coefﬁcients depends only on the local geometry of the involved elements. It can
be performed for all valid channel pairs in a pre-processing step, independently from the
presence of transmitters and receivers. In the case of partial changes in the geometry, one
may update affected regions only.
Regarding a plane wave incident on element Aj, the angle between the wave vector and
the normal n^j of element Aj is denoted as θ j, as seen in Figure 5.11, and the angle ϕ
denotes the angle between the emitted wave vector and the angle of ideal reﬂection or
transmission. Therefore, the coupling coefﬁcients are given as follows:

From geometric optics and material properties of the element, the fraction f
is
assumed to be known and represents the intensity of the plane wave that is emitted
towards an element Ak. Once the power that arrives at Aj from Ai by channel α is known,
it is possible to calculate the fraction of that power that arrives at element Ak via channel
β.
To couple transmitters to the channels previously deﬁned, the coupling of transmitter
i to channel β conducting from element Aj to Ak if element Ai is made inﬁnitesimally

Now it is time to couple receivers to channels. For this, the power Pα that ﬂows in
channel α feeds all receivers that lie in this channel. The power Pα is divided into small
cylinders β with cross-section πd2 4 running from element Ai to element Aj. Each of
them carries a fraction ωβ of the power Pα. The energy ﬂux Φβ in cylinder β of a channel α

In summary, there is no need to perform ray-tracing computations every time a
transmitter location is changed when using this model; it is only necessary to perform
building preprocessing knowing basic geometrical characteristics, as well as material
constitutive parameters (conductivity, permittivity and permeability) to perform the
predictions. This speeds up the algorithm considerably, hence making it suitable for
optimization of indoor base stations within a building.
Complex building geometries may result in time and computer demanding prepro­
cessing computations, which could take a considerable amount of time. Also, highly
changeable environments such as some airport facilities, for which the building layout
and characteristics are quite changeable, may not be a good option for the use of this
algorithm for optimization purposes. Finally, the algorithm does not implicitly take into
account diffraction effects, although this could be incorporated later once the prepro­
cessing has been performed.
5.6.6
Angular Z-Buffer Algorithm for Efﬁcient Ray Tracing
A deterministic, fully three-dimensional, based on geometrical optics (GO) and the
uniform theory of diffraction (UTD) ray-tracing technique to predict the propagation
channel parameters in indoor scenarios is presented in Cátedra et al. (2000). A very
efﬁcient ray-tracing algorithm called angular Z-buffer (AZB) is presented, which allows a
reduction in the time necessary to obtain the multipath propagation. The key concept of
AZB consists in reducing the number of rigorous tests that have to be made by reducing

137
5 Channel Modelling
the number of plane facets (conforming the geometrical description of the environment)
that each ray has to treat.
The propagation model is based on GO and the UTD, including the effects related to
the transmission, a very important effect in these scenarios. Effects such as direct ﬁeld,
single- and double-reﬂected ﬁelds, single- and double-diffracted ﬁelds and combinations
of multiple effects are considered. The electric ﬁeld at the observation point O is given

The AZB algorithm consists of dividing the space seen from the source in angular
regions and storing the facets of the model in the regions where they belong. In this way,
for each ray only the facets stored in its region need be analysed. Also, the facets are
ordered in each region according to their distances from the source, since the closer
facets have more possibilities for hiding rays.
Details of the application of the AZB to each of the propagation effects (direct ray,

well as results of the use of the AZB for predictions on a third ﬂoor of a building in Bilbao,
Spain. The reduction in processing time is shown to be as much as 93.1%, going from a
simulation of 1 h 32 min 42 s without AZB to only 5 min 56 s, having a standard deviation
of the prediction error of 7.29 dB.
5.6.7
Intelligent Ray-Tracing (IRT) Model
The mobile radio channel in indoor scenarios is characterized by multipath propagation.
Dominant propagation phenomena inside buildings include:
 The shadowing of walls
 Waveguiding effects on corridors due to multiple reﬂections
 Diffractions around vertical wedges.
In order to accelerate the time-consuming path determination the intelligent ray-
tracing (IRT) model (Wölﬂe, Gschwendtner and Landstorfer, 1997) is based on a
preprocessing of the building data, thus combining high accuracy with a short compu­
tation time.
Each penetration of a wall, each reﬂection at the surface of a wall and each diffraction
at a wedge is an interaction. The intelligent ray-tracing method considers all propagation
paths that fulﬁl the following criteria:
 Up to 6 reﬂections (at surfaces of walls/objects)
 Up to 6 penetrations (of walls/objects)
 Up to 2 diffractions (at wedges)
 Up to a total number of 6 interactions (all combinations of reﬂections, penetrations
and diffractions).
IRT is based on the following assumptions:
 Only a few rays to deliver the main part of energy.
 The visibility relation between walls and edges are independent of the position of the
transmitter antenna (base station).
 Often adjacent receiver pixels are reached by similar rays.
Based on these considerations, a preprocessing of the building database is made once.
In this preprocessing the obstacles in the building database are subdivided into small
tiles, as shown in Figure 5.12. The visibility relations between these tiles are determined

and stored. During the prediction these data can be read and have not to be determined
again. This accelerates the computation time signiﬁcantly.
The IRT performs a much more rapid computation of ﬁeld strength than full ray-
tracing models, with very similar accuracy. This is due to the preprocessing performed to
determine visibility areas according to the geometry of the building. Key propagation
mechanisms are taken into consideration, such as diffraction, reﬂections and transmis­
sion. However, the preprocessing operation takes a considerable amount of time prior to
performing predictions, which may be a disadvantage, especially for optimization
purposes. Also, as reported in AWE Communications GmbH (2007), although predic­
tions are accurate close to the transmitter, they are much less accurate as the distance
between the transmitter and the receiver increases.
5.6.8
Hybrid Parabolic Equation-Integral Equation Indoor Model
The model presented in Theoﬁlogiannakos, Xenos and Yioultsis (2007) is a 3-D hybrid
technique for the simulation of wave propagation in complex indoor environments. This
method employs a wide-angle parabolic equation (PE) to estimate the electromagnetic
ﬁeld within walls and obstacles, whereas a correction based on the Green function
approach provides improved ﬁeld approximations. This method is applied in 3-D using
simple validation models, whereas an approximate 2-D analysis is attempted for a much
more realistic ofﬁce space. The authors state that this hybrid technique is more
systematic and automated, compared to ray-tracing methods, having moderate com­
putational requirements.
A ﬁrst 2-D approach for the development of a PE-based method for indoor commu­
nications has been presented in Theoﬁlogiannakos, Xenos and Yioultsis (2007) and
applied in simple models of scattering from inﬁnite cylinders. The method combines a 2­
D wide-angle PE multistep scheme, based on a Padé approximation of the forward wave
equation and a fast Green function formulation. At a ﬁrst step, the PE is used to calculate
an estimate of the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the interior of the elements comprising the
building structure (walls, doors, windows and various objects).
The PE effectively decomposes the 2-D problem in a series of 1-D problems,
successively solved by a marching-in-space approach. Still, there are quite important
propagation rays that are not taken into account, such as all-backward reﬂected,
diffracted or scattered waves. Hence, a second step is employed to introduce a proper
correction of the ﬁeld by a Green's function approach, using the induced equivalent
currents within the walls and other structures, computed by the PE technique, as
secondary sources. The resulting correction is, thus, fast and does not involve a matrix
system solution.
This model thus presents a rigorous generalization in 3-D of the model stated in
Theoﬁlogiannakos, Xenos and Yioultsis (2007), where the PE decomposes the domain in
a series of 2-D problems on successive transverse planes. The wide-angle PE, solved by
the ﬁnite element method (FEM), is combined with the ﬁeld correction to form the
hybrid parabolic equation-integral equation method (PE-IEM). The full 3-D solver is
much more cumbersome, compared to the 2-D one, although it can be successfully
applied to solve problems within domains that span several wavelengths and are only
marginally treatable by other full-wave techniques like FEM in 3-D or the ﬁnite-
difference time domain (FDTD) method. Application to larger-scale problems, involving

140
Indoor Wireless Communications
realistic 3-D indoor environments, spanning tens or hundreds of wavelengths is
deﬁnitely feasible, at the cost of increased run times, but can be highly automated
provided that a 3-D model of the indoor environment under consideration can be
extracted by CAD software. According to Theoﬁlogiannakos, Xenos and Yioultsis
(2007), before employing such a tedious task, a wise idea would be to attempt a 2-D
analysis ﬁrst, which would possibly provide some idea of the capabilities of the proposed
analysis. Indeed, the hybrid PE-IEM technique has been applied to a 2-D model of an
ofﬁce building ﬂoor (excluding the ﬂoor and ceiling) and compared to measurements.
The computational errors were assessed and a clear improvement comes out as a result
of the IEM correction, as opposed to the PE alone.
This IE-PE hybrid method seems to give reasonably accurate results for 2-D environ­
ments, showing improvement when compared to PE (parabolic equation) methods and
when FDTD (ﬁnite difference time domain) or FEM (ﬁnite element methods) are not
applicable.
There is no clear evidence reported in Theoﬁlogiannakos, Xenos and Yioultsis (2007)
or anywhere in the literature that suggests that this method can be applied successfully to
complex 3-D environments. In fact, the authors state that: 'Its application in realistic 3D
settings, where methods like FEM or FDTD are totally inapplicable, is the next step to be
considered. It is deemed feasible by means of appropriate speedup techniques and can
potentially offer an alternative to existing ray-tracing techniques.' Therefore, the amount
of computational resources and time it takes has not made it even comparable in
processing speed to ray-tracing techniques. It might be a promising new algorithm but,
so far, it is not there yet!
5.7 Hybrid Models
Indoor propagation models that combine measurements to tune some of its parameters
and take into account physical principles that are explicitly included in the modelling
approach are known as hybrid models. Nowadays, this approach is having increasing
popularity, since sufﬁcient accuracy can be obtained with less computational effort than
purely physical models. On the other hand, on the basis that carefully calibrated radio
measurements are conducted for model tuning, these models can be applied reasonably
easily to any building, as is the case for empirical models.
5.7.1
Reduced-Complexity UTD Model
Given the complexity of models such as those given in Section 5.6.4, it is attractive to
seek approaches that retain the physical principles while reducing the associated
complexity. The model proposed in Cheung, Sau and Murch (1998), validated for use
at around 900 MHz, incorporates much of the propagation phenomena suggested by
electromagnetic theory, such as UTD, but still retains the straightforwardness of the
empirical approach. Computation time is not as heavy as in pure ray-tracing models.
Likewise, the empirical factors required in the model can be closely related to
theoretical derivations, so that model tuning or curve ﬁtting to measured data may
not be required.

Three propagation mechanisms have been incorporated in this model. The ﬁrst factor
is a dual-slope model for the main path, similar to that for microcell propagation.
Around 900 MHz, a breakpoint distance of about 10 metres is suggested, denoted as rb.
The second factor included is an angular dependence of attenuation factors. Less power
is transmitted through walls when the incidence is oblique, as compared with normal
incidence. Therefore, the wall attenuation factor Lwi (and likewise the ﬂoor attenuation
factor Lf i) is made to depend on the angle of incidence. A simpliﬁed diffraction
calculation is also included.
The resulting model is given by

To keep the diffraction model simple, Cheung, Sau and Murch (1998) utilized only
one level of diffraction from corners, including the door and window frames in the
building. To perform this, the ﬁeld was calculated at each corner using the equation

Diffraction coefﬁcients for perfect electrical conductors under UTD (Kouyoumjian

and Pathak, 1974) are used in the model and are denoted as D r ; ϕ; r ; ϕ´, where r; ϕ are

In Cheung, Sau and Murch (1998), at 900 MHz the parameters n2  2:5, rb  10 m,
Lw  10 dB (concrete block walls) and Lw  5 dB (hollowed plaster board walls) are
obtained from measurements, while n1 is taken as 1. Good prediction accuracy is
claimed. This model combines the best of ray tracing with empirical approaches,
which makes it very robust and accurate, especially for long distances where other
purely empirical models do not perform very well, as they minimize diffraction effects.
However, as was the case with other models, it does not take reﬂections into account,

142
Indoor Wireless Communications
which results in minimization of waveguiding, an effect that is more evident in
corridors.
5.7.2
Measurement-Based Prediction
Empirical models are usually limited to providing a rather general description of
propagation, while higher accuracy for a speciﬁc site usually requires detailed physical
models. Site-general models are not usually sufﬁcient for an efﬁcient system design in a
particular building, while physical models are often too complex to implement in
practice, as has been discussed in the previous sections. Thus, hybrid models have
been developed to overcome these disadvantages, which aim to combine the best of both
approaches.
As an intermediate approach, suitable for high-conﬁdence designs, site-speciﬁc
measurements may be used to determine the details of the propagation mechanisms
and material parameters for a particular building without suffering the high cost of
precise entry of wall and ﬂoor materials and geometries. Such a measurement-based
prediction approach is described in detail in Aragón-Zavala et al. (2006). A ﬂowchart of
the algorithm is depicted in Figure 5.13. Site information such as antenna coordinates
and radiation patterns is required for path loss extraction. These parameters along with
the signal strength measurements are processed to yield measurements of path lossFigure depicting measurement-based prediction (MbP) algorithm.

against location. This loss is made up of two components. The ﬁrst is a distance-
dependent r component, resulting from the bulk characteristics of the propagation
medium, known as median path loss L50:
L50  k1  10n log r  k2r
(5.36)
Constants k1 and k2 are tuned with the ﬁeld strength measurements to obtain an
optimized model, which often represents a best-ﬁt model for the collected data. The
path loss exponent n is determined from this optimization (tuning) process. The
second component for the path loss depends on the characteristics of the nearby
propagation environment (local clutter). Subtracting the distance-dependent part of
Equation (5.36) from the total loss L yields the latter component, known as shadowing
or slow fading Ls:
Ls  L  L50
(5.37)
The derived shadowing parameters are used to generate a set of shadowing predic­
tions for the whole area of interest, mapped on to each prediction point. The result is
added to the distance-dependent path loss predictions produced by the propagation
model for the area. The result has then very similar characteristics to measurements that
would have been produced not only at the measurement route but over the whole
prediction area, without the need for detailed building geometry, as with ray-tracing
algorithms.
The use of appropriate spatial statistics enables the measurement data to be applied
across the whole building, well beyond the measurement route. Reuse of these
data, together with empirical models for the wall and ﬂoor loss factors, also allows
the system design to be optimized for antenna locations and types without remeasur­
ing, even for different frequency bands than the original measurements. See
Figure 5.14 for an example, where the directional transmit antennas are marked as
black triangles.
One of the most relevant characteristics of this model is that it predicts path loss in
areas where other indoor models fail to do so, such as those revealed by slow fading. For
example, if there is a ﬂoor of a building that has speciﬁc signal variations due to clutter,
such as walls, furniture, etc., then MbP takes these into account and in fact tunes these
variations with the measurements that are used as part of the modelling process. It is true
that it requires measurements more often perhaps than other similar models, but the
authors believe that this is the case anyway since radio measurements are employed for
model tuning and validation - thus accurate radio testing is of extreme importance, as
will be discussed in Chapter 7.
5.8
Outdoor-to-Indoor Models
A technique often employed to provide coverage inside buildings is to allow the signal
from surrounding macrocells to penetrate the building through external walls, windows
and doors; that is macrocell penetration. However, sometimes when an indoor cell is to
be deployed in a venue, existing coverage from surrounding macrocells should be
determined, to adjust, for example, handover levels in cellular systems. Even though

measurements are used for this purpose, modelling is also required when measurements
are not available in all the building relevant areas.
Outdoor-to-indoor models are utilized to characterize signal propagation inside
buildings coming from an external base station. This section highlights the most
important ones.
5.8.1
COST-231 Line-of-Sight Model
In cases where a line-of-sight path exists between a building face and the external
antenna, the following semiempirical model has been suggested (COST-231, 1999), with
the geometry deﬁned in Figure 5.15.
Here re is the straight path length between the external antenna and a reference point
on the building wall; since the model will often be applied at short ranges, it is important
to account for the true path length in three dimensions, rather than the path length along
the ground. The loss predicted by the model varies signiﬁcantly as the angle of incidence,

is varied.
The total path loss is then predicted as follows:

The model is valid at distances up to 500 m and the parameter values in Table 5.5 are
recommended for use in the 900-1800 MHz frequency range. They are in good
agreement with measurements from real buildings and implicitly include the effects
of typical furniture arrangements.

Indoor Wireless Communications
The COST-231 model for outdoor-to-indoor penetration losses is normally taken as a
reference. It is very simple to implement and fast predictions can be made even without
measurement data - taking the recommended parameters given in the paper. Despite its
limitations, it can produce reasonable estimations of signal strength if limited informa­
tion is available. On the other hand, the frequencies upon which the model is valid are
restricted to only GSM cellular in Europe (900/1800 MHz). Also, the assumption that the
direct ray to the point of interest is the dominant contribution to the overall penetration
loss is not entirely accurate, as windows and doors through diffraction can have a
signiﬁcant impact on predictions. Reﬂections from adjacent buildings are not taken into
account and the indoor loss is assumed to depend on only a speciﬁc attenuation
constant, which could be valid for very short distances close to the better wall - the
one closest to the point of interest.
5.8.2
COST-231 Non-Line-of-Sight Model
This is a variation of the LOS discussed in the previous section, which is also
documented in COST-231 (1999). The model relates the loss inside a building from
an external transmitter to the loss measured outside the building, on the side nearest to
the wall of interest, at 2 m above ground level. The loss is given by
L  Lout  Le  Lge  maxL1; L3  Gf h
(5.41)
where L3  αri and ri, Le, α and L1 are as deﬁned in the COST-231 line-of-sight model
(Section 5.8.1). The ﬂoor height gain Gf h is given by
nGn
Gf h 
(5.42)
hGh
where h is the ﬂoor height above the outdoor reference height (m) and n is the ﬂoor
number, as deﬁned in the ﬁgure shown in Section 5.8.1. Shadowing is predicted to be
lognormal with location variability of 4-6 dB. Other values are as shown in Table 5.6.
Both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight models of COST-231 rely on the domi­
nant contribution penetrating through a single external wall. A more accurate estimation
may be obtained by summing the power from components through all of the walls.
The model takes into account other propagation effects observed in measurements,
such as ﬂoor height gain and dependence on the angle of incidence. This resembles
much better the propagation effects in an outdoor-to-indoor scenario. It is also very
simple to implement and fast predictions can be made. Transmission losses of the
dominant wall can be obtained either from the literature or from measurements; if the

latter case is addressed, these measurements include many other effects, such as
reﬂections and diffraction for wall partitions and openings, which otherwise will not
be able to be accounted for using only reported transmission losses.
5.8.3
Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) Penetration Model
Based on the COST-231 outdoor-to-indoor propagation model described in Section
5.8.1, this model is intended to be used for broadband wireless access (BWA) services, as
reported in Oestges and Paulraj (2004). It is based on measurements for various
buildings in Seattle and San Francisco, USA, considering the impacts of wall material,
angle of incidence and receiver antenna height. The COST-231 model, as taken from the
authors, computes the total path loss in dB as
L  Lout  Lex  Lout  Le  Lg1  cos ϕ2  nwLi
(5.43)
where Lout is the path loss from the base station to the external wall at the same height as
the receiver, Lex is the outdoor-to-indoor excess path loss, Le is the path loss through the
external wall at normal incidence ϕ  0°, Lg is the additional external wall loss incurred
at grazing incidence ϕ  π=2, Li is the path loss per internal wall and nw is the number of
crossed internal walls. The external wall attenuation Le must take into account the entire
considered wall; for example the presence of windows has a signiﬁcant impact on the
performance of the model. The model relies on the attenuation of a dominant compo­
nent coming through a single wall.
For the case of high-scattering NLOS environments, it may not be possible to isolate
any single path, and thus Oestges and Paulraj (2004) suggest a new expression for the
excess loss Lex:
Lex  Le  L´
ge  nwLi
(5.44)
where Lge  Lg1  cos ϕ2has been transformed into an average parameter L´ . This
ge
results from the fact that several dominant waves arrive at the best wall from different
angles. It somehow accounts for an average attenuation rather than a worst case for
normal incidence. This model is valid for frequencies up to 2.5 GHz.
Another importance addition to the COST-231 model is that the present formulation
includes the impact of the ﬂoor height in the outdoor path loss Lout, using validated
models for outdoor-to-outdoor path loss.
Model parameters are reported in the paper as shown in Table 5.7, for a frequency of
2.5 GHz for three different wall materials. Parameters for other frequencies can be
obtained by tuning the model with measurements.

Indoor Wireless Communications
This model is relatively simple, taking as reference the COST-231 NLOS model, with
slight variations in the way one of the parameters should be taken into account for excess
loss. It should be noticed that the model is intended to be used in high-scattering NLOS
scenarios. Bear in mind that the model has been tested for ﬁxed broadband wireless
access scenarios, which differ from those observed in mobile communications. However,
the fundamentals of the model seem appropriate even for a mobile receiver inside the
building. BWA is seen as a worst-case scenario when compared to mobile communica­
tions, according to the authors. Also, if parameters need to be obtained for other
frequencies, various types of measurements are required, as speciﬁed in the paper,
adding complexity to the model.
5.8.4
Ichitsubo-Okamoto Outdoor-to-Indoor Model (800 MHz-8 GHz)
This model, applicable from 800 MHz to 8 GHz (Okamoto, Kitao and Ichitsubo, 2010),
also takes as a reference the NLOS COST-231 model (COST-231, 1999) and, using
similar model parameters, a new model is proposed:
L  Lout  αri  hGh  αf log f  αLOSLOS  W
(5.45)
The new parameters introduced here are: LOS is the condition of the line-of-sight
between the transmitter (outdoor) and the place at the window on the measured ﬂoor
(LOS: LOS = 1, NLOS: LOS = 0) and W is the difference between Lout, the propagation
loss between the external transmitter and the receiver, located in the road around the
building, and Lin, the propagation loss between the transmitter and the receiver inside
the building:
W  Lout  Lin
(5.46)
The constant W is taken at the window of the main wall, αf is the frequency coefﬁcient, α
is the penetration distance coefﬁcient (distance attenuation), Gh is the ﬂoor height gain
and αLOS is the LOS coefﬁcient.
Therefore, the prediction formula for the penetration loss is proposed as follows for
NLOS (LOS = 0):
L  Lout  0:6ri  0:6h  10
(5.47)
The applicable range for the distance from the nearest window is 0-20 m, the applicable
frequency is 0.8-8 GHz and the applicable area is a room or hallway with a window. The
applicable range of the ﬂoor height is 1.5-30 m. It is interesting to note that the authors
report a small value of αf  1:1, obtained within the frequency range over which the
model is applicable.
The results obtained by the authors make the model extremely simple to implement,
and the fact that the penetration loss is frequency-independent over that frequency range
(validated by extensive measurements they performed, as reported in the paper)
simpliﬁes even further its implementation. For more accurate results, some of the
originally proposed parameters can be tuned with measurements, if desired, and the
process is not too complex.

149
5 Channel Modelling
Another advantage is that predictions can be quickly made, even without measure­
ments, for a rough estimate of the levels inside the building. However, the fact that the
authors averaged many of the recommended model parameters imposes a restriction on
the accuracy of the model and a careful analysis should be made if better accuracy is
desired.
5.8.5
Taga-Miura Model Using Identiﬁcation of Path Passing Through Wall Openings
In the COST-231 model (COST-231, 1999), the penetration point is that on the LOS wall
closest to the mobile station regardless of wall structure. The radio waves transmitted by
the base station penetrate the wall at this point and propagate inside the building. For the
model proposed in Miura, Oda and Taga (2002), not only is this direct path taken into
account but also those radio waves propagating through the structural openings along
the walls. These wall openings are only doors and windows. Introducing the angle
dependency of the losses with the paths that penetrate the indoor area improves the
model accuracy, according to the authors (see Figure 5.16).
For the proposed model, the outdoor-to-indoor propagation loss is divided in three
parts: the outdoor propagation loss Lout, the building penetration loss Lpn and the indoor
losses Lin:
L  Lout  Lpn  Lin
(5.48)
All of the above losses are in dB. The geometry of the model can be seen in Figure 5.16. If
there are several wall openings, the received level is the sum of path levels of paths
through all such wall openings. For example, for path 1 in the ﬁgure, the penetration loss
is given by
Lpn;1  Le  Lg1  cos θ1  Lgi sin ϕ1
(5.49)
Figure  dep icting g eom etr y forMthe Taga-Miura outdoo r-to-indoor model.

150
Indoor Wireless Communications
The value of Lgi recommended by the authors according to measurements is 20 dB. For
the indoor loss, for simplicity, a constant loss per unit distance is proposed, as follows
(for path 1):
Lin;1  αr1
(5.50)
The constant α is obtained from measurements and is known as the attenuation
coefﬁcient. The model was tested at 8.45 GHz using CW measurements, and the
following parameters were obtained: Lg  20 dB, Le  17:2 dB, α  0:348 dB=m and
Lgi  20 dB.
This model takes into account wall openings, which enhances outdoor-to-indoor
predictions (in principle) when compared to the COST-231 model, keeping its simplicity
and involving only a few more additions.
There are errors and an offset reported by the authors of 20 dB, who explain that these
losses are mainly due to furniture and speciﬁc clutter, hence causing radio waves not to
propagate directly from the opening to the receiver. It also suffers from most of the
disadvantages already mentioned for the COST-231 model approach.
5.9 Models for Propagation in Radiating Cables
Radiating cables are elements that are used in indoor designs to provide an alternative for
uniform coverage in tunnels and corridors when antennas may not be suitable, as
explained in Chapter 6. Thus, propagation models have been developed in the literature,
which considers the use of radiating cables, as explained in this section.
5.9.1
Zhang Model
A radiating cable model for indoor environments is proposed in Zhang (2001). This
model is an empirical one, conﬁgured for frequencies of around 2 GHz. It takes into
consideration both coupling and longitudinal losses of the cable. The equation that
shows the overall link loss, combining the cable losses and propagation losses, is

where z is the longitudinal distance along the cable to the point nearest the receiver (m),
α is the attenuation per unit length of the cable (dB/m), Lc is the coupling loss referenced
to 1 m radial distance from the cable (dB), Lv is the variability in coupling loss (dB), Lb is
the loss factor due to blockage (dB), r is the shortest distance between the cable and the
receiver (m) and n is the path loss exponent. These parameters are better observed in
Figure 5.17.
The particular situation analysed by the author was an academic building with
reinforced concrete ﬂoors, 3.83 m ceiling height with a suspended false ceiling at
2.83 m, internal brick walls and external glass walls, with rooms interconnected via a
corridor, along which ran the leaky feeder. In this case the model parameters were
Lc  70:9 dB; Lv  3:4 dB; Lc  9:9 dB, α  0:12 dB=m and n  0:6. Note the very small
value of the path loss exponent, indicating how the cable produces a very consistent level
of coverage, although the particular parameters would depend strongly on the cable type

and the environment. Coupling loss, longitudinal loss and variability in coupling loss are
obtained from the cable's manufacturer.
Since it is an empirical model, it is very easy to implement, predictions are fast and its
accuracy is strongly dependent on the quality of the measurements used to tune the
model. In its present form, it only can predict path loss accurately in the close vicinity of
the radiating cable; however, a more accurate indoor model needs to be incorporated for
longer distances, especially as the signal goes through more walls and partitions, as the
one described in Section 5.9.3. Also, at the termination of the radiating cable, it is not
clearly speciﬁed in the paper how distances should be taken into account to avoid
discontinuities.
Due to the fact that it depends on manufacturer's cable parameters, a very complete
database of various radiating cable types is required for accurate predictions. Otherwise,
a methodology for calculating some of these parameters needs to be incorporated.
5.9.2
Carter Model
K. Carter proposed a radio propagation model that considers the radiating cable as a line
source and waves are spread in a cylindrical surface (Carter, 1998). A radiating cable
straight section is taken into account and terminated with an antenna. In the near ﬁeld
and considering a mono-pole antenna in the receiver, the radio propagation is modelled
in linear scale as
3λ2
p
(5.52)
r  pt 8π2αzdL
where p is the received power, pt is the transmit power, λ is the wavelength, αz is the
r
longitudinal attenuation, d is the radial distance between the cable axis and the receiver
in meters and L is the radiating cable length in metres.
Fading characteristics are not modelled by Carter. On the other hand, Rayleigh fading
is compensated for in the customary fade margin applied to the link budget. Wall, clutter
and ﬂoor losses are modelled separately as empirical correction factors.
One of the restrictions of this model is that only a straight length of radiating cable can
be modelled. The author states that changes to cable bending may be overshadowed by
diffraction and reﬂections from the clutter, something that deﬁnitely is arguable.

Nevertheless, this model provides a good approximation to estimate signal strength from
a leaky feeder, with reported standard deviations of the prediction error of around 5 dB.
The author claims that the main source of errors is due to wall losses.
5.9.3
Seseña-Aragón-Castañón Model
An alternative approach to model radio propagation along radiating cables is proposed
in Seseña-Osorio et al. (2013). Based on the Zhang model described in Section 5.9.1, the
modelling of some key propagation mechanisms that are present in a practical indoor
environment have been incorporated into this model: reﬂections, refraction losses,
radiating cable paths and cable termination. In particular, ﬁrst reﬂected rays and
transmission losses are calculated with empirical coefﬁcients, which are not dependent
on the wall constitutive parameters or the incident angle.
Figure 5.18 illustrates a radiating cable installed along a corridor. Assuming that the
radiating cable generates rays that are perpendicular to the cable axis, there are three
paths along which the signal travels. Two paths are generated due to the ﬁrst reﬂection of
the signal in walls. The distances of reﬂected signals in walls W 1 and W 2 are d1 and d2,
respectively. Meanwhile, there is a direct ray that travels from the radiating cable to the
receiver, where its distance is d0. Thus, the received power is composed by the addition
of three paths (in watts) and is determined as

Note that in equation (5.53) the power in watts is expressed in lowercase and R1 and R2
are empirical coefﬁcients.
Figure 5.19 illustrates the scenario when there is a wall between the receiver and the
radiating cable. Considering d1 as the distance between the cable and the receiver, the
received power is given by

the radial distance between the cable axis and the receiver in metres and n is the path loss
exponent. The transmission coefﬁcient T1 is derived empirically from measurements.
Unlike the Carter and Zhang models that only assume straight radiating cable
sections, this model takes into account situations where there are cable bends, as
depicted in Figure 5.20. The received power for Figure 5.20(a) needs to be calculated as

frequencies between 900 MHz and 2.5 GHz.

Wideband Channel Characteristics
The ﬁrst part of this chapter was dedicated to narrowband channel models, aimed at
predicting the median path loss to determine coverage in an indoor network. Radio

planning often is interested in estimating coverage levels for antennas deployed in a
building. However, another important part of indoor radio planning is concerned with
the maximum achievable data rate at a given frequency, and this is greatly determined by
the echoes that are produced by multiple versions of the same signal reaching the
receiver at different times. This could lead to intersymbol interference (ISI), which limits
the symbol duration in a digital communication system, directly related to the data rate.
The situation is simple to understand: the higher the data rate, the shorter the symbol
duration, which for large delays in the various replicas of the original signal will cause a
replica (or echo) arriving at the receiver when another symbol is to be transmitted - this
is ISI.
The power delay proﬁle (PDP) for the channel is one of the most important parameters
characterized in wideband channel models. This represents the duration between
replicas of the same signal (taps) that are received, and therefore are strongly related
to the maximum achievable data rate. Indoor cells have approximately RMS delay
spreads in the range 0.01 to 0.05 μs. For more details on the speciﬁcation of PDP, refer to
Saunders and Aragón-Zavala (2007).
In general and since scatterers are to each other inside buildings, the delays that are
experienced by the signal taps are not too long compared to those seen outdoors and
therefore higher data rates are possible inside buildings. In fact, for LTE systems, using

MIMO actually greatly improves data rates by taking all those replicas and adding them
coherently using OFDM. Nevertheless, the modelling and characteristics need to be
known in advance for efﬁcient radio planning.
A good example in the modelling of the wideband characteristics of an indoor channel
is given in Seseña-Osorio et al. (2015), where the frequency response for a radiating cable
in the band 1.3 GHz to 1.8 GHz is obtained. The methodology used is shown in
Figure 5.21. First, the experiment was designed by selecting the components, the
conﬁguration of the devices, and the sites or regions available for the development
of frequency response measurements. Second, the assembly of the measurement system
was made as well as its respective calibration. Then, the measurements were carried out
and their positions were recorded. Once the frequency responses were obtained, the
coherence bandwidth and the impulse response were calculated by using the auto-
correlation function and the inverse discrete Fourier transform, respectively. The rms
delay spread was then calculated by using the impulse response. The model parameters
were obtained from measurements and the autoregressive model was applied in each
room. Finally, simulated frequency responses and coherence bandwidth were calculated.

As regards the rms delay spread of the channel, values encountered in most cases
are very much lower than those found in either micro- or macrocells. However, the
variability around the median value is large, although there is a strong correlation with
the path loss and there are occasionally cases where the delay spread is very much
larger than the median. In order to provide reasonably realistic simulations both
situations must be considered. Table 5.8 gives suitable channels for an indoor ofﬁce
scenario, intended for evaluation purposes at around 2 GHz (ETSI, 1997). Values for
the RMS delay spread for indoor-to-indoor environments are also shown in Table 5.9;
case A represents low but frequently occurring values, case B represents median values
and case C gives extreme values that occur only rarely. The very high cases can occur
particularly if there are strong reﬂections from buildings situated a long way from the
building under test.
5.11
Noise Considerations
Noise is an unwanted random-like signal that affects any electronic system. In particular
and since received signal levels are very small, noise can considerably affect wireless
communication systems and degrade its performance.
Since this book is focused on indoor wireless systems, special attention will be given to
those noise sources and calculations that are relevant and present inside buildings. For a
deeper analysis and study of noise, refer to Saunders and Aragón-Zavala (2007).

157
5 Channel Modelling
5.11.1
Noise Sources
Sources of noise vary, but in general we can consider the following:
 Any object that has a temperature above 0° K will generate thermal noise, which
results from the excitation of charges (electrons) due to increases in temperature
producing a randomly varying potential. This type of noise is also called white noise
and is present in all frequencies; its power pN in watts can be computed as follows:
pN  kTB
(5.58)
where k  1:38  1023 JK1 is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the device's tempera­
ture in Kelvin degrees and B is the bandwidth in hertz. Note that thermal noise is
normally taken as the reference or minimum noise in a communication system. In
practice, for in-building systems, this noise ﬂoor is considered when calculations are
to be made to establish whether a system is uplink or downlink limited, and all other
noise sources need to be added to this noise ﬂoor.
 Receiving aerials 'pick up' sky noise, especially those where the elevation angle is small.
This type of noise is also wideband, similar to white noise. Indoor systems rarely
experience this type of noise, which is more relevant in satellite links, for parabolic dish
receiving aerials.
 Shot noise occurs in active devices used in ampliﬁers and receivers, and is generated by
the random ﬂuctuations in the ﬂow of electrons crossing the emitter-base or
collector-base junctions within a transistor, or any other type of active semiconductor
device.
5.11.2
Noise Parameters
It is often common practice to deﬁne parameters that establish the quality of the link,
such as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which establishes the signal level above noise for
a system to deliver the expected quality-of-service. In digital systems, the bit error rate
(BER) is used, which also can be associated with SNR depending on the type of service
that is being delivered.
Every time the signal is ampliﬁed, repeaters and receivers also add noise to the signal.
Therefore, this signal degradation needs to be quantiﬁed using SNR as follows:
pS
SNR 
(5.59)
pN
where pS is the signal power in watts and pN is the noise power also in watts. Note that
the input SNR is always going to be greater than the output SNR, as additional noise is
added to a system, even though both signal and noise power are ampliﬁed equally.
To quantify the amount of noise a device adds to the thermal noise, the noise ﬁgure
(NF) is often employed, deﬁned as follows:
SNRi
pN;out
NF  10 log
 10 log
(5.60)
SNRo
kTB

158
Indoor Wireless Communications
where SNRi is the input SNR, SNRo is the output SNR, NF is the noise ﬁgure in dB, pN;out
is the device output noise power and kTB is the thermal noise. Note that the noise ﬁgure
represents the amount of noise in dB the device adds above thermal noise and therefore
special care should be taken when selecting devices for an in-building system with
reasonable low noise ﬁgures, particularly at the receiver front end (Saunders and
Aragón-Zavala, 2007). Recall that the ﬁrst component in a receiver contributes the
most to the overall SNR.
Another parameter that is usually employed to characterize noise is known as noise
temperature Te, which can be related to the noise ﬁgure as follows:
10NF=10  1 T
Te 
(5.61)
where T is the reference temperature in Kelvin. Thus the noise temperature is given for a
noise source which, when placed at the input of a network, yields the same output noise
as if the network were noiseless. Noise temperature is more frequently used in satellite
communication systems and is rarely employed for indoor wireless networks.
The noise ﬂoor in a system PN;f loor in dBm is the noise power at a given noise ﬁgure for
a given bandwidth and is a parameter often employed in receivers, ampliﬁers or any
active component. Thus:
PN;f loor  10 logkTB  NF  GdB
(5.62)
Note that GdB is the gain of the device in dB. Therefore, the receiver sensitivity Pr;dBm in
dBm can be calculated knowing the noise ﬂoor and the service SNR requirement in
decibels SNRdB as follows:
Pr;dBm  PN;f loor  SNRdB
(5.63)
Finally, bear in mind that the noise ﬁgure is speciﬁed to active equipment by manufac­
turers, but for passive elements (cables, attenuators, splitters), the noise ﬁgure is given by
the insertion loss of the element. Therefore, be aware that lossy cables installed prior to
received antennas will have a detrimental effect on the system noise ﬁgure and should be
avoided.
5.11.3
Considerations for Indoor Wireless Systems
Indoor radio planners and designers need to understand that, for example, passive loss in
a distributed antenna system (DAS), which will be further explored in Chapter 9, will
increase the total system noise ﬁgure.
Noise control is therefore essential for indoor networks, especially in cascaded systems
having various active and passive devices that will degrade the system SNR. Gains need to
be adjusted according to noise ﬁgures and losses of all system components so that the
system noise ﬁgure can be optimized. In general, low noise ﬁgure components should be
employed in the receiver front end and use high-gain ampliﬁers there to further
maximize the overall SNR. DAS systems are especially sensitive to noise degradation
if noise is not properly accounted for. For UMTS systems noise can deﬁnitely be a
limiting factor and considerably reduces the data rate and cell size.

DAS, refer to Tolstrup (2011).

specialized software. Most of the commercially available packages are either used for
outdoor environments and mainly for cellular or are free versions with simple calcula­
tions for Wi-Fi networks. As indoor planning has been taking popularity over the last few
years, more radio planning tools have incorporated the functionality of performing
indoor planning but at different levels. Some of the most popular indoor planning tools

modelling options for indoor as follows:
 High-ﬁdelity ray-tracing models
- X3D (multithreaded and GPU accelerated). The X3D Ray model is Remcom's ﬁrst
ray-based model to use GPU acceleration to reduce calculation time. X3D is a 3-D
propagation model, so there are no restrictions on geometry shape or transmitter/
receiver height. The model includes effects from reﬂections, diffractions, transmis­
sions, and atmospheric absorption. Applications include urban, indoor, and
indoor-outdoor propagation scenarios.
- Full 3D. Remcom's Full 3D model is a general propagation model that can be
applied to urban, indoor and indoor-outdoor propagation. The model can handle
arbitrary geometry and transmitter/receivers at any height. Users have the option of
performing the ray tracing with the shooting and bouncing ray (SBR) method, or
Eigenray, which is based on the method of images. The model includes effects from
reﬂections, diffractions and transmissions.
 Empirical propagation models
- Wall Count. The Wall Count model is the Wireless InSite Real Time method for
indoor calculation. Direct rays are constructed between the transmitter and the
receiver, and every wall intersected in the indoor geometry is counted. Each
intersection adds an additional 3 dB of loss to free-space path loss.
5.13
Conclusion
Mathematical models for narrowband and wideband channels are a very useful tool for
any radio planner, as they assist in the estimation of radio coverage as well as

163
5 Channel Modelling
determination of time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics of the channel.
However, and since the in-building radio channel is complex due to the large variability
of materials, geometries and characteristics, indoor channel models are still the subject
of research and development efforts worldwide. It is therefore wise to keep an eye on
recent publications and literature available in the form of research and white papers,
both from academia and industry. The range of frequencies and applications is growing
as newer services are offered and therefore keeping this up to date is a priority.
The modelling of building penetration loss (BPL) has not shown consistent results to
date, with a large variety of studies following different methodologies and therefore
arriving at contradictory conclusions in some cases - for some authors BPL increases
with frequency, whereas for others it decreases. Nevertheless, some progress has been
made and dependencies with clutter and depth have also been investigated.
When coming to the choice of an in-building planning tool, there are various aspects
to take into consideration, such as: cost, customer support, ﬂexibility, operating system
and computing requirements, computation speed, accuracy, range of propagation
models to choose, compatibility with other applications and measurement data, etc. I
am presenting a survey of some of the most popular suites but the ﬁnal decision has to be
made by the engineer responsible for designing the indoor network.
Finally, one of the key elements in the success of channel models is the use of accurate
measurements, both to obtain them and to validate their predictions. Note that the
equipment used in these measurements should be properly validated and calibrated for
accurate results. This includes the miscellaneous RF components associated with the
measurements. Radio measurements for in-building planning is the subject of Chapter 7.

Antennas
So far, we have discussed the way radio waves propagate through various media and how
the speciﬁc constitutive parameters of materials have an effect on this propagation.
Propagation effects such as reﬂection, refraction, scattering and diffraction are present in
many practical situations, hence making the task of estimating the received signal
strength in a wireless link a challenge. Furthermore, we have deﬁned the concept of path
loss and described various propagation models that aim at predicting this path loss more
accurately, so that system designers can make use of these tools in designing efﬁcient
radio systems. When the link budget concept was examined, we mentioned that we
needed 'antennas' at transmitter and receiver ends in order to send signals wirelessly, but
did not attempt to go any further in our analysis - we simply assumed that antennas
produce a gain while transmitting or receiving that should be accounted for. It is time
now to discuss in detail what antennas are, to gain a better understanding and to be able
to select such devices for speciﬁc applications for indoor wireless projects. Note that the
aim of this chapter is not to provide a thorough analysis of antennas and electromagnetic
effects, as in Hayt and Buck (2005), Kraus and Fleisch (1999) and Sadiku (2007), but
rather to understand their basic characteristics, speciﬁcations and performance param­
eters needed to select the right antennas for given indoor requirements.
6.1
The Basics of Antenna Theory
Most fundamentally, an antenna is a way of converting the guided waves present in a
waveguide, feeder cable or transmission line into radiating waves travelling in free space,
or vice versa, as seen in Figure 6.1. The ﬁelds trapped in the transmission line travel in
one dimension towards the antenna, which converts them into radiating waves, carrying
power away from the transmitter in three dimensions into free space.
The art of antenna design is to ensure that this process takes place as efﬁciently as
possible, with the antenna radiating as much power from the transmitter into useful
directions, particularly the direction of the intended receiver, as practically as can be
achieved.
I think most of us have experienced the typical case of using a paper clip or a clothes
hook as an antenna and it works! To be more speciﬁc, it couples some of the radiation,
but not necessarily in an efﬁcient way. Now think about a satellite link for a geostationary
orbit (GEO), where the signal has to travel 36 000 km from the satellite to the ground
station; if the receive antenna is not properly designed, the extremely tiny received signal

will be superseded by noise and not properly coupled - thus the importance of designing
efﬁcient antennas!
6.1.1
Conditions for Radiation
As a direct consequence of Maxwell's equations (Maxwell, 1861, 1865), a group of
charges in uniform motion (or stationary charges) do not produce radiation. However,
radiation does occur if any of the following conditions is met (Figure 6.2):
 The velocity of the charges in a given wire is changing in time.
 The charges are reaching the end of the wire and reversing direction, producing
radiation.Figure depicting conditions for radiation.
Figure 6.2 Conditions for radiation.

169
6 Antennas
 The speed of the charges remains constant, but their direction is changing, thereby
creating radiation.
 The charges are oscillating in periodic motion, causing a continuous stream of
radiation.
Antennas can therefore be seen as devices that cause charges to be accelerated in ways
that produce radiation with desired characteristics. Similarly, rapid changes of direction
in structures that are designed to guide waves may produce undesired radiation, as is the
case when a printed circuit track carrying high-frequency currents changes direction
over a short distance.
6.1.2
Antenna Regions
The space surrounding an antenna is usually subdivided into regions, as seen in
Figure 6.3. These regions are so designated to identify the ﬁeld structure in each.
Although no abrupt changes in the ﬁeld conﬁgurations are noted as the boundaries are
crossed, there are distinct differences amongst them. The boundaries separating these
regions are not unique, although various criteria have been established and are
commonly used to identify these regions.
The reactive near-ﬁeld region is deﬁned as that portion of the near-ﬁeld region
immediately surrounding the antenna wherein the reactive ﬁeld predominates.
The radiating near-ﬁeld or Fresnel region, close to an antenna, is that for which the
ﬁeld patterns change very rapidly with distance and include both radiating energy and
reactive energy; although the radiating ﬁeld predominates, the ﬁeld oscillates towards
and away from the antenna, appearing as a reactance that only stores but does not
dissipate energy.
Further away, in the far-ﬁeld or Fraunhofer region, the reactive ﬁelds are negligible and
only the radiating energy is present, resulting in a variation of power with direction that
is independent of distance. Within the far-ﬁeld region, the wavefronts appear very closely
as spherical waves, so that only the power radiated in a particular direction is of
importance, rather than the particular shape of the antenna. Measurements of the power
radiated from an antenna have either to be made well within the far ﬁeld, or else special
account has to be taken of the reactive ﬁelds.
Figure 6.3 Deﬁnition of ﬁeld regions.

170
Indoor Wireless CommunicationsPhotograph depicting antennas mounted close to metallic structures affecting radiation characteristics.
Figure 6.4 Antennas mounted close to metallic structures affecting radiation characteristics.
In siting an antenna, it is particularly important to keep other objects out of the near
ﬁeld, since they will couple with the currents in the antenna and change them, which in
turn may greatly alter the designed radiation and impedance characteristics. An example
of this is shown in Figure 6.4, where an antenna has been mounted on a hoist basket but
too close to the metal structure of the basket, thus distorting the antenna radiation
characteristics. This can be particularly relevant in buildings with exposed metallic
structures such as stadiums or sports arenas, where antennas may need to be mounted
close to these structures and therefore extra care should be taken.
6.2 Antenna Parameters
Antennas are often characterized by various parameters that deﬁne speciﬁc character­
istics of antenna performance. When selecting antennas, the evaluation of such

171
6 Antennas
parameters is very important and, thus, a good understanding of each is essential.
Antenna parameters deﬁne the performance and characteristics of an antenna, as well as
make them distinct from others. These parameters are often used when designing an
indoor wireless system and are also given by antenna manufacturers to assist system
designers in the correct selection of the antenna type. As we will see later on, the choice
of antenna parameters is not only inﬂuenced by their technical performance but also by
its mechanical characteristics and appearance - there are speciﬁc indoor environments
in which antennas need to be 'disguised'.
6.2.1
Radiation Pattern
The radiation pattern of an antenna is a plot of the far-ﬁeld radiation from the antenna.
More speciﬁcally, it is a plot of the power radiated from an antenna per unit solid angle or
its radiation intensity. Radiation intensity in a given direction is the power radiated from
an antenna per unit solid angle (steradian) and is speciﬁed in the far-ﬁeld of the antenna
as follows:
U  r2Srad
(6.1)
where U is the radiation intensity in watts, r is the radial distance from the antenna to the
point of interest in metres and Srad is the radiated power density in W=m2.
Radiation patterns are usually plotted by normalizing the radiation intensity by its
maximum value and plotting the result. An example of a radiation pattern in 3-D is given
in Figure 6.5, showing its main characteristics.
Antenna manufacturers often specify radiation patterns using only two cuts: azimuth
(horizontal) and elevation (vertical), as seen in Figure 6.6. Therefore, for propagation
work, it is necessary to interpolate the values given for these cuts to work out an
approximate value of gain for given intermediate angles.
Radiation patterns are often given in polar coordinates (Figure 6.7), having angle and,
instead of specifying absolute gain, a relative attenuation with respect to maximum gain
(boresight) is given. For example, for 30° in azimuth, the radiation pattern plot may
indicate an attenuation of 3.8 dB and, if the maximum gain of the antenna is 7 dBi, then
the absolute gain at this angle would be 7 −3:8  3:2 dBi.Figure depicting antenna radiation pattern in 3-D: (a) omnidirectional; (b) directional.
Figure 6.5 Antenna radiation pattern in 3-D: (a) omnidirectional; (b) directional.

172
Indoor Wireless Communications
Figure 6.6 Antenna cuts - horizontal (azimuth
plane) and vertical (elevation plane).
For a radiation pattern, various lobes can be identiﬁed, as shown in Figure 6.8, as follows:
 Main lobe, which includes the direction of maximum radiation.
 Side lobe, expressing the amplitude of the largest side lobe, usually expressed in
decibels relative to the peak of the main lobe.
 Back lobe, with radiation diametrically opposite the main lobe.
The nulls indicate the angles at which no radiation occurs, either for transmit or
receive, according to the reciprocity theorem, as also shown in Figure 6.8. In fact, it is
through the nulls that adaptive (intelligent) antennas steer their main radiation pattern
towards the desired user and places interferers in the null directions.
The shape of the radiation pattern changes across frequency bands; thus, manufac­
turers specify radiation pattern plots at given frequencies. For accurate design work, the
radiation pattern having the closest frequency to that in which the system will operate
must be used.Figure depicting 2-D radiation pattern of a directional panel antenna in the elevation plane.

173
6 Antennas
Figure 6.8 Radiation pattern lobes.
The direction of maximum radiation is normally known as the boresight. The
beamwidth is the angular separation between two identical points on opposite sides
of the pattern maximum.
In summary, various parts of a radiation pattern are referred to as lobes. These can be
further classiﬁed as follows:
 Radiation lobe: portion of the radiation pattern bounded by regions of relatively weak
radiation intensity. Major lobe (main beam): the radiation lobe containing the
direction of maximum radiation.
 Minor lobe: any lobe except a major lobe; this includes the side lobes as well as the back
lobe. For indoor radio systems, radiation has to be directed towards a desired area and
minimized in other directions, in both horizontal and vertical directions.
 Side lobe: a radiation lobe in any direction other than the intended lobe. These side
lobes are quite relevant for interference control, especially in sectors.
 Back lobe: radiation lobe whose axis makes an angle of approximately 180° with
respect to the beam of an antenna. This back lobe is particularly important for
interference when installing a directional antenna, or for through-ﬂoor penetration if
an omnidirectional antenna is mounted on a ceiling.
On the other hand, there are additional parameters that need to be speciﬁed for
antenna radiation patterns, as follows:
 Null: angle of minimum radiation or reception; for some applications, nulls are placed
at speciﬁc directions to cancel interferers.
 Boresight: direction of maximum radiation; the maximum antenna gain is often
speciﬁed at this direction.
Let us illustrate some of these properties with a practical example. The Andrew
DB992HG28N-B directional antenna is presented in Figure 6.9, with a maximum gain of
16 dBi - we will see later how the antenna gain is speciﬁed, but for now let us take it as it
is. Horizontal and vertical beamwidths are shown, as well as main and side lobes.
Radiation patterns are often speciﬁed in polar coordinates by manufacturers, using two
orthogonal cuts: horizontal and vertical.

Figure 6.9 Antenna radiation pattern example.
6.2.2
Directivity
In order to deﬁne the concept of directivity, ﬁrst it is important to introduce an
isotropic radiator, which will be used as a reference of directivity and gain. An isotropic
radiator is a hypothetical antenna that radiates power equally in all directions, as seen
in Figure 6.10. This cannot be achieved in practice, but acts as a useful point of
comparison.
The power density Srad depends on radiated power Prad over a sphere of radius r and is
given by
Prad

Thus, according to Equation (6.2), the radiation intensity of an isotropic source is

Figure 6.10 Isotropic antenna.

175
6 Antennas
If Equation (6.3) is plotted as a radiation pattern, a sphere is produced, the radiation
intensity of which is constant in all directions.
Once we have understood the concept of an isotropic source, it is time now to deﬁne
directivity. The directivity of an antenna is deﬁned as the ratio of the radiation intensity
in a given direction from the antenna to the radiation intensity averaged over all
directions. Thus, the directivity d is a function of direction, as follows:
Radiation intensity of antenna in direction θ; ϕ
dθ; ϕ 
Mean radiation intensity in all directions
Radiation intensity of antenna in direction θ; ϕ
 Radiation intensity of isotropic antenna radiating the same total power
U

(6.4)
U0
Notice that the isotropic source is considered a reference in the denominator since it
radiated equally in all directions. Sometimes directivity is speciﬁed without referring to a
direction. In this case the term 'directivity' implies the maximum value. It is also
common to express the directivity in decibels. The use of the isotropic antenna as a
reference is then emphasized by giving the directivity units of dBi:
D  10 log d
(6.5)
Notice that we use d to express directivity in linear scale and D to indicate it in decibels.
We will use this convention throughout this book when the same parameter can be
expressed in linear and logarithmic scales. The directivity of an antenna increases as its
beamwidth is made smaller, since the energy radiated is concentrated into a smaller solid
angle. For large antennas, with a single major lobe, the half-power beamwidth of the
antenna in the azimuth and elevation directions may be related to its directivity by the
following approximate formula:
41; 253

Where θ°

To illustrate directivity, suppose we need to ﬁnd the maximum directivity of an
antenna with the following radiation power density:

We need to write an expression for the directivity as a function of the vertical and

Equation (6.4) is used as follows:

The maximum radiation intensity Umax occurs at θ  90° and is Umax  s0. To compute

6.2.3
Radiation Resistance and Efﬁciency
The equivalent circuit of a transmitter and its associated antenna is shown in Figure 6.11.
The resistive part of the antenna impedance is split into two parts, a radiation resistance
Rr and a loss resistance Rl. The power dissipated in the radiation resistance is the power
actually radiated by the antenna and the loss resistance is power lost within the antenna
itself. This may be due to losses in either the conducting or dielectric parts of the
antenna.
Since only the radiated power normally serves a useful purpose, it is useful to deﬁne
the radiation efﬁciency e of the antenna as
Power radiated
Rr
e 

(6.13)
Power accepted by antenna
Rr  Rl
Figure 6.11 Equivalent circuit of a transmitting antenna.

177
6 Antennas
An antenna with high radiation efﬁciency therefore has high associated radiation
resistance compared with the losses. The antenna is said to be resonant if its input
reactance Xa  0. Thus, antennas that are designed to resonate at certain frequencies
have their optimum behaviour at those frequency bands; that is an antenna designed to
be used for 802.11 g Wi-Fi cannot be used to operate in the LTE 800 MHz band.
6.2.4
Power Gain
The power gain g, or simply the gain, of an antenna is the ratio of its radiation intensity to
that of an isotropic antenna radiating the same total power as accepted by the real
antenna. When antenna manufacturers specify simply the gain of an antenna they are
usually referring to the maximum value of g. From the deﬁnition of efﬁciency e, the
directivity and the power gain are then related by:
gθ; ϕ  edθ; ϕ
(6.14)
Gain may be expressed in dBi to emphasize the use of the isotropic antenna as reference:
G  10 log g
(6.15)
It is also common to express power gain in dBd if a dipole antenna gain is used as a
reference:
GdBd  GdBi  2:14
(6.16)
Although the gain is, in principle, a function of both azimuth and elevation together, it is
common for manufacturers to specify patterns in terms of the gain in only two
orthogonal planes, usually called cuts. In such cases the gain in any other direction
may be estimated by assuming that the pattern is separable into the product of functions
gθ and gϕ which are functions of only θ and ϕ, respectively. Thus:
gθ; ϕ 
 
 
(6.17)
gθ θ gϕ ϕ
To understand the concept of power gain in an antenna better and why dBi units are
used, an example is shown in Figure 6.12. This example shows how a dipole antenna gainFigure depicting the power gain of an antenna with respect to an isotropic source.

178
Indoor Wireless Communications

is represented having as reference an isotropic radiator. In this case, at boresight, the
dipole exhibits 2.14 dB more gain than the isotropic source; therefore, the dipole is said
to have a gain of 2.14 dBi. If dBd units were used, then the dipole gain would be 0 dBd
(since the dipole is the reference).
A very important parameter related to antenna power gain between the front and back
lobes now needs to be described. The front-back ratio is deﬁned as the gain of the
direction of maximum radiation, also known as boresight, compared to the gain of the
antenna at 180° from the speciﬁed azimuth, as seen in Figure 6.13. Manufacturers often
express this parameter in decibels.
For directional antennas, the front-back ratio represents how well the antenna
isolates any radiation in the back lobe. This is particularly important for interference
and leakage control (signal spillage outside of a building) issues. The choice of a high
front-to-back ratio ensures that leakage is kept under control for contiguous rooms or
spaces, if directional antennas mounted on walls or pillars are used, or controlled in
contiguous ﬂoors for ceiling-mounted omnidirectional antennas.
In the radiation pattern plot in Figure 6.13, the difference in gain between the 0°
(boresight) and 180° (back lobe) is 25 dB. This means that the maximum gain is 25 dB
above the back lobe gain.
6.2.5
Bandwidth
The bandwidth of an antenna is deﬁned as the range of frequencies within which the
performance of the antenna, with respect to some characteristic, conforms to a speciﬁed
standard. The bandwidth can be considered to be the range of frequencies, on either side
of the centre frequency, where the antenna characteristics (e.g. input impedance,
radiation pattern, beamwidth, polarization, side lobe level, gain, beam direction, radia­
tion efﬁciency) are within an acceptable value for those at the centre frequency.
For broadband antennas, the bandwidth is usually expressed as the ratio of the upper­
to-lower frequencies of acceptable operation. For example, a 10:1 bandwidth indicates
that the upper frequency is 10 times greater than the lower.

179
6 Antennas
For narrowband antennas, the bandwidth is expressed as a percentage of the
frequency difference (upper minus lower) over the centre frequency of the bandwidth.
For example, a 5% bandwidth indicates that the frequency difference of acceptable
operation is 5% of the centre frequency of the bandwidth.
The bandwidth of an antenna expresses its ability to operate over a wide frequency
range. It is often deﬁned as the range over which the power gain is maintained to within
3 dB of its maximum value. The bandwidth is usually given as a percentage of the
nominal operating frequency. The radiation pattern of an antenna may change dramati­
cally outside its speciﬁed operating bandwidth.
As a practical example of the antenna bandwidth, let us assume that we need an
antenna to extend the coverage of our wireless LAN (Wi-Fi) network at home. If we use a
Yagi antenna intended to operate in the UHF frequency band, it is very likely that we will
get some coupling but not the desired performance, since this Yagi antenna has been
designed to operate at a different frequency band.
6.2.6
Reciprocity
Provided the environment is linear (which is a very good assumption for mobile radio
propagation), then:
If a voltage is applied to the terminals of an antenna A and the current measured at
the terminals of another antenna B then an equal current will be obtained at the
terminals of antenna A if the same voltage is applied to the terminals of antenna B.
Thereforetheantennagainisthesamewhetherusedforreceivingortransmitting,andall
of the gain and pattern characteristics are fully applicable in either the transmit or receive
mode. This is known as the reciprocity theorem and is shown graphically in Figure 6.14.
Figure 6.14 Reciprocity theorem.

180
Indoor Wireless Communications
According to the reciprocity theorem, it does not matter which end transmits when
measuring or predicting propagation between two points in an environment.
For example, we can analyse the radiation pattern characteristics of an antenna in both
ways: either when it is used to transmit, having a well-deﬁned behaviour, or an identical
behaviour when it receives electromagnetic waves, say, in a given direction, for which a
speciﬁc gain is measured.
6.2.7
Receiving Antenna Aperture
If an antenna is used to receive a wave with a power density of S watts per square metre, it
will produce a power in its terminating impedance (usually a receiver input impedance)
of Pr watts. The constant of proportionality between Pr and S is Ae, the effective aperture
of the antenna in square metres:
Pr  AeS
(6.18)
For some antennas, such as horn or dish antennas, the aperture has an obvious physical
interpretation, being almost the same as the physical area of the antenna (Figure 6.15),
but the concept is just as valid for all antennas. The effective aperture may often be very
much larger than the physical area, especially in the case of wire antennas. Note,
however, that the effective aperture will reduce as the efﬁciency of an antenna decreases.
Antenna directivity d is related to the effective aperture as follows:

To get an idea of the effective aperture for a GSM indoor directional antenna, let us
calculate the effective aperture for a beam antenna having a half-power beamwidth of 30°
and 35° in perpendicular planes intersecting in the beam axis at 900 MHz. The

maximum antenna gain is also to be computed. Minor lobes are small and may be
neglected. The antenna has a radiation resistance of 50 Ω and loss resistance of 8 Ω.
Thus, the effective aperture for this beam antenna can be determined from its gain/
directivity, as they are related according to Equation (6.19). The wavelength needs to be
computed ﬁrst:

6.2.8
Beamwidth
The beamwidth of an antenna represents the angular separation between two identical
points on opposite sides of the radiation pattern. It is expressed as an angle and gives an
indication of the directivity of the antenna.
There are two types of beamwidth often used, which are described as follows:
 Half-power beamwidth ( HPBW). This is the angle between the two directions in
which the radiation intensity is one half value of the maximum (Figure 6.16).
 First-null beamwidth ( FNBW). Angular separation between the ﬁrst nulls of the
radiation pattern.
As expected, the more directive an antenna, the higher is the gain, but this happens at
the expense of potentially not illuminating some desired areas.
There is a trade-off between the HPBW and the side lobe level: if the HPBW is
increased, the side lobe level decreases. This has the advantage of reducing interference
issues as the side lobes are reduced, at the expense of reduced gain and directivity.
6.2.9
Cross-Polar Discrimination
The cross-polar discrimination (XPD) of an antenna for a given direction is the
difference in dB between the peak co-polarized gain of the antenna and the cross-
polarized gain of the antenna in the given direction. It can also be seen as a measure of

182
Indoor Wireless CommunicationsFigure depicting half-power beamwidth (HPBW): the angle made between the two directions in which the radiation intensity is one half value of the maximum.
Figure 6.16 Half-power beamwidth (HPBW).
the strength of a co-polar transmitted signal that is received cross-polar by an antenna as
a ratio to the strength of the co-polar signal that is received.
One of the applications for which XPD is used is polarization diversity. Polarization
can be used to reduce co-channel interference. Due to XPD, when a horizontally
polarized antenna receives a co-channel signal sent from a vertically polarized antenna
(and vice versa), the effective signal strength is reduced by several dB.
The XPD can be calculated as follows:
E12
XPD  20 log
(6.25)
E11
E11 is the co-polarized component and E12 is the co-polarized component, assuming
vertical polarization, in the scenario depicted in Figure 6.17.
6.2.10
Polarization Matching
The polarization state of an antenna describes the direction of the electric ﬁeld that the
antennas transmit (in the far ﬁeld), similarly to how polarization is deﬁned for an
electromagnetic wave.
Polarization can be linear, circular or anything in between (elliptical), though for most
mobile systems linear polarization is preferred. Circular polarization is often used for
satellite communications applications, to overcome all depolarizing effects from which
the wave suffers when it passes through the atmosphere.
Figure 6.17 Cross-polar discrimination (XPD).

183

Figure 6.18 Polarization mismatch loss.
By applying reciprocity, it is clear that the polarization response of the antenna is the
same when used in the receive mode (i.e. the antenna will produce maximum power
when the incoming wave is aligned to the antenna polarization).
There is polarization mismatch if the polarization state of the incoming wave and that
of the receiving antenna are different, as shown in Figure 6.18. If the incident wave's
electric ﬁeld vector is given by

Antenna Types
6.3.1
Linear Wire
The most basic antenna is that made of a single wire, which is fed by an alternating
current whose wavelength is comparable to the size of the wire. In this category, there are
various types of wire antennas, which are described in this section.
If a length of a two-wire transmission line is fed from a source at one end and left open-
circuit at the other, then a wave is reﬂected from the far end of the line. This returns
along the line, interfering with the forward wave. The resulting interference produces a
standing wave pattern on the line, with peaks and troughs at ﬁxed points on the line
(upper half of Figure 6.19). The current is zero at the open-circuit end and varies
sinusoidally, with zeros of current spaced half a wavelength apart. The current ﬂows in
opposite directions in the two wires, so the radiation from the two elements is almost
exactly cancelled, yielding no far-ﬁeld radiation.
If a short section of length L=2 at the end of the transmission line is bent outwards, it
forms a dipole perpendicular to the original line and of length L (lower half of
Figure 6.19). The currents on the bent section are now in the same direction and
radiation occurs. Although this radiation does change the current distribution slightly,

184
Indoor Wireless Communications
Figure 6.19 Half-wave dipole.
the general shape of the current distribution remains the same and a sinusoidal
approximation may be used to analyse the resulting radiation pattern. This type of
antenna is known as a dipole.
Some qualitative results may be deduced:
 Since the dipole is rotationally symmetric around its axis, it must be omnidirectional,
whatever the current distribution.
 In a plane through the transmission line and perpendicular to the plane of the page in
Figure 6.19, the distance from the arms of the dipole to all points is equal. Hence the
radiation contributions from all parts of the dipole will add in phase and a lobe will
always be produced.
 The current always points directly towards or away from all points on the axis of the
dipole, so no radiation is produced and a null appears at all such points.
The radiation characteristics of a dipole antenna resemble a doughnut-shaped pattern,
as shown in Figure 6.5. A dipole is an omnidirectional antenna in the azimuth plane,
whereas its radiation characteristics vary in the elevation plane.
If the length of the dipole is changed, so its radiation pattern changes, since the current
distribution changes and the ﬁelds are added differently to that of exactly a half-wave
length (Saunders and Aragón-Zavala, 2007).
For a dipole at resonance, its impedance becomes purely resistive. A half-wave dipole,
the most popular one, has an impedance of 73 Ω and a gain of 2.15 dBi, which is taken as a
reference for expressing antenna gains in dBd.
6.3.2
Loop
A loop antenna is a radio antenna consisting of a loop (or loops) of wire, tubing or other
electrical conductor with its ends connected to a balanced transmission line. Within this

185
6 AntennasPhotograph depicting loop antennas.
Figure 6.20 Loop antennas.
physical description there are two very distinct antenna designs: the small loop (or
magnetic loop) with a size much smaller than a wavelength and the resonant loop
antenna with a circumference approximately equal to the wavelength. Figure 6.20 shows
an example of loop antennas.
Small loops have a poor efﬁciency and are mainly used as receiving antennas at low
frequencies. Except for car radios, almost every AM broadcast receiver sold has such an
antenna built inside it or directly attached to it. These antennas are also used for radio
direction ﬁnding. A technically small loop, also known as a magnetic loop, should have a
circumference of one tenth of a wavelength or less. This is necessary to ensure a constant
current distribution round the loop. These antennas are more typically used in those
applications for which signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance is more important than
efﬁciency.
Self-resonant loop antennas are larger. They are typically used at higher frequencies,
especially VHF and UHF, where their size is manageable. They can be viewed as a form of
folded dipole and have somewhat similar characteristics. The radiation efﬁciency is also
high and similar to that of a dipole.
The helical antenna (Figure 6.21) can be considered a vertical array of loops, at least for
the case when the diameter of the helix is small compared to a wavelength. The result is
normal mode radiation with a higher gain than a single loop, providing an omni­
directional antenna with compact size and reasonable efﬁciency, but rather narrow
bandwidth. It is commonly used for hand-portable mobile applications where it is more
desirable to reduce the length of the antenna below that of a quarter-wave monopole.
In the case where the diameter is around one wavelength or greater, the mode of
radiation changes completely to the axial mode, where the operation of the antenna is

186

similar to that of a Yagi but with circular polarization. This mode is commonly used for
satellite communications, particularly at lower frequencies where a dish would be
impractically large.
6.3.3
Antenna Arrays
The maximum directivity available from a single dipole was shown in Figure 6.20 to be
limited to that which can be achieved with a dipole a little over one wavelength. In some
applications this may not be sufﬁcient. One approach to improving on this is to combine
arrays of dipoles, or of other antenna elements, where the amplitude and phase with
which each element is fed may be different. The ﬁelds produced by the elements then
combine with different phases in the far ﬁeld, and the radiation pattern is changed. This
also allows the radiation pattern to be tailored according to the particular application or
varied to allow beam scanning without any physical antenna motion. If the amplitude
and phase weights are controlled electronically, then the beam can be scanned very
rapidly to track changes in the communication channel.
Arrays may be linear or planar, as explained in Saunders and Aragón-Zavala (2007). A
linear array allows beam steering in one dimension, permitting directivity to be obtained
in a single plane; hence an omnidirectional pattern can be synthesized. A planar array has
two dimensions of control, permitting a narrow pencil beam to be produced.
In general, antenna arrays can be made with the combination of any antenna types, but
the most popular ones are those made with dipoles. We will see later on in this chapter
some examples of practical antenna arrays.
6.3.4
Travelling Wave and Broadband
A travelling-wave antenna (Figure 6.22) is a class of antenna that uses a travelling wave
on a guiding structure as the main radiating mechanism. Travelling-wave antennas fall
into two general categories: slow-wave antennas and fast-wave antennas, and both are
usually referred to as leaky-wave antennas.
In slow-wave antennas, the guided wave is a slow wave, meaning a wave that
propagates with a phase velocity that is less than the speed of light in free space.
Such a wave does not fundamentally radiate by nature, and radiation occurs only at
discontinuities (typically the feed and the termination regions). The propagation

187
6 AntennasFigure depicting travelling-wave antenna.
Figure 6.22 Travelling-wave antenna.
wavenumber of the travelling wave is therefore a real number (ignoring conductor or
other losses). Because the wave radiates only at the discontinuities, the radiation pattern
physically arises from two equivalent sources, one at the beginning and one at the end of
the structure. This makes it difﬁcult to obtain highly directive single-beam radiation
patterns. However, moderately directive patterns having a main beam near end-ﬁre can
be achieved, although with a signiﬁcant sidelobe level. For these antennas there is an
optimum length depending on the desired location of the main beam. Examples include
wires in free space or over a ground plane, helixes, dielectric slabs or rods, and
corrugated conductors. An independent control of the beam angle and of the beam
width is not possible.
By contrast, the wave on a leaky wave antenna (LWA) may be a fast wave, with a phase
velocity greater than the speed of light. This type of wave radiates continuously along its
length and hence the propagation wavenumber kz is complex, consisting of both a phase
and an attenuation constant. Highly directive beams at an arbitrary speciﬁed angle can be
achieved with this type of antenna, with a low sidelobe level. The phase constant of the
wave controls the beam angle (and this can be varied, changing the frequency), while the
attenuation constant controls the beamwidth. The aperture distribution can also be
easily tapered to control the sidelobe level or beam shape. Leaky-wave antennas can be
divided into two important categories, uniform and periodic, depending on the type of
guiding structure.
Broadband antennas are those designed to operate over a very wide bandwidth. This
can be achieved either by using a slotted-wave antenna or by integrating many microstrip
(patch) antennas to have a multiband performance.
6.3.5
Microstrip
Patch antennas are based upon printed circuit technology to create ﬂat radiating
structures on top of dielectric, ground-plane-backed substrates. The appeal of such
structures is in allowing compact antennas with a low manufacturing cost and high

188
Indoor Wireless Communications
reliability. It is in practice difﬁcult to achieve this at the same time as acceptably high
bandwidth and efﬁciency. Nevertheless, improvements in the properties of the dielectric
materials and in design techniques have led to enormous growth in their popularity and
there are now a large number of commercial applications. Many shapes of patch are
possible, with varying applications, but the most popular are rectangular (pictured),
circular and thin strips (i.e. printed dipoles).
In the rectangular patch, the length is typically up to half of the free-space wavelength.
The incident wave fed into the feed line sets up a strong resonance within the patch,
leading to a speciﬁc distribution of ﬁelds in the region of the dielectric immediately
beneath the patch, in which the electric ﬁelds are approximately perpendicular to the
patch surface and the magnetic ﬁelds are parallel to it. The ﬁelds around the edges of the
patch create the radiation, with contributions from the edges adding as if they consti­
tuted a four-element array. The resultant radiation pattern can thus be varied over a wide
range by altering the length and width.
A major application of patch antennas is in arrays, where all of the elements, plus the
feed and matching networks, can be created in a single printed structure. An example of
a patch antenna is shown in Figure 6.23.
6.3.6
Yagi-Uda
Another array-based approach to enhancing the directivity of dipole antennas is to use
parasitic elements. Parasitic elements are mounted close to the driven dipole and are
not connected directly to the source. Instead, the radiation ﬁeld of the driven element
induces currents in the parasitics, causing them to radiate in turn. If the length and
position of the parasitic elements are chosen appropriately, then the radiation from the
parasitics and the driven element add constructively in one direction, producing an
increase in directivity. The classic form of such an antenna is the Yagi-Uda, or simply
Yagi antenna, illustrated in Figure 6.24 and widely used as a television reception
antenna. For in-building applications, this type of antenna is very widely used whenPhotograph depicting patch antenna.

two buildings are to be interconnected in a 'bridging' application, especially for Wi-Fi.
Also, these types of antennas are used when repeaters are employed, and are installed
on rooftops to pick up the signal from a 'donor' macrocell. The use of repeaters will be
expanded in Chapter 9.
Typically, the driven element is made a little shorter than λ2 in order to permit a good
match to 50 Ω. Elements in the radiation direction, called directors, are made a little
shorter than the driver element, and an element very close to λ2 is placed behind and
called the reﬂector. Increasing the number of directors increases the gain, although the
improvement diminishes according to how far the director is from the driven element. A
four-director Yagi can have a gain of up to around 12 dBi.
6.3.7
Aperture Antennas
By deﬁnition, an aperture antenna is that in which the beamwidth is determined by the
dimensions of a horn, lens or reﬂector. In other words, those antennas for which their
directivity is proportional to their aperture are classiﬁed as aperture antennas. Since
some of these antennas are very important, sections in this chapter have been dedicated
to describe them in more detail. We have included this term here, 'aperture antennas',
since it is used in the literature to refer to those types of antennas with similar
characteristics to those described earlier.
6.3.8
Horn
The horn antenna is a natural evolution of the idea that any antenna represents a region of
transition between guided and propagating waves (Figure 6.1). Horn antennas are highly
suitable for frequencies (typically several gigahertz and above) where waveguides are the
standard feed method for they consist essentially of a waveguide whose end walls are ﬂared
outwards to form a megaphone-like structure, as shown in Figure 6.25. In the case
illustrated, the aperture is maintained as a rectangle, but circular and elliptical versions are
also possible. The dimensions of the aperture are chosen to select an appropriate resonant
mode, giving rise to a controlled ﬁeld distribution over the aperture.

190
Indoor Wireless CommunicationsPhotograph depicting horn antennas.
Figure 6.25 Horn antennas.
The best patterns (narrow main lobe, low side lobes) are produced by making the
length of the horn large compared to the aperture width, but this must be chosen as a
compromise with the overall volume occupied. A common application of horn antennas
is to be used as the feed element for parabolic dish antennas in satellite systems.
6.3.9
Monopole
Reﬂector antennas rely on the application of image theory, which may be described as
follows. If an antenna carrying a current is placed adjacent to a perfectly conducting
plane, that is the ground plane, then the combined system has the same ﬁelds above the
plane as if an image of the antenna were present below the plane. The image carries a
current of equal magnitude to the real antenna but in the opposite direction, and is
located an equal distance from the plane as the real antenna but on the other side. This
statement is a consequence of Snell's law of reﬂection, given the Fresnel reﬂection
coefﬁcients for a perfect conductor. Examples of reﬂector antennas include monopoles
and parabolic dishes.
The monopole antenna results from applying image theory to the dipole. If a
conducting plane is placed below a single element of length L/2 carrying a current,
then the combined system acts essentially identically to a dipole of length L except that
the radiation only takes place in the space above the plane, so the directivity is doubled
and the radiation resistance is halved (Figure 6.26). The quarter-wave monopole thus
approximates the half-wave dipole and is a very useful conﬁguration in practice for
mobile antennas, where the conducting plane is the car body or handset case.
Monopoles are very popular for portable antennas, although in recent years they have
been replaced by sleeve dipoles.
6.3.10
Parabolic Reﬂector (Dish)
The parabolic (dish) antenna extends the reﬂector antenna concept to curved reﬂectors
(Figure 6.27). In this case, the number of images is effectively inﬁnite and the locations of

191
6 AntennasFigure depicting monopole antenna.
Figure 6.26 Monopole antenna.
the images are such as to produce a parallel beam from the reﬂector, provided that the
driven element is placed at the focus of the parabola. All the energy is effectively focused
on the driven element, thus producing a very directive antenna.
The gain of a parabolic dish can be increased essentially arbitrarily by enlarging the
size of the dish; this makes it appropriate for long-range communications applications,
such as satellite or space systems. They are also used for terrestrial applications where
the distance is considerable and very narrow beams are needed; for example microwave
links, since diffraction losses may affect the link performance. Also, for Wi-Fi systems,
parabolic dishes are the preferred choice when connecting two buildings.Photograph depicting parabolic reflector dish, where parabolic reflector, and driven element are indicated by arrows.

Smart Antennas
The limiting factor on the capacity of a cellular mobile system is interference from co­
channel mobiles in neighbouring cells. Adaptive antenna technology can be used to
overcome this interference by intelligent combination of the signals at multiple antenna
elements at the base station and potentially also at the mobile. In order to perform this
joining together efﬁciently and accurately, a thorough knowledge of the propagation
channel will be required for every pair of antennas from the base to the mobile.
In a phased array, a set of antenna elements is arranged in space and the output of each
element is multiplied by a complex weight and combined by summing, as shown in
Figure 6.28 for a four-element case.
The complete array can be regarded as an antenna in its own right, with a new output
y. The radiation patterns of the individual elements are summed with phases and
amplitudes depending on both the weights applied and their positions in space; this
yields a new combined pattern.
If the weights are allowed to vary in time, the array becomes an adaptive array and can
be exploited to improve the performance of a mobile communication system by
choosing the weights so as to optimize some measure of the system performance.
Typically this would be done by estimating the desired weights using a digital signal

processor (DSP) and applying them in complex baseband to sampled versions of the
signals from each of the elements. The same approach can be used on both transmit and
receive due to the reciprocity of the channel and the antenna elements themselves, but
there are considerable challenges associated with assessing the downlink channel state
with sufﬁcient accuracy to achieve the full potential of adaptive antennas.
The basic aim of a mobile adaptive antenna system is to improve the performance of
the system in the presence of both noise and interference; this is achieved by effectively
steering the radiation antenna patterns dynamically in order to cancel interferers (direct
nulls to them) and maximize wanted user coverage. This concept has been further
exploited in what is known as space division multiple access, or SDMA, which offers the
potential for greatly increasing system capacity in future mobile systems.
6.4
Antenna Performance Issues
6.4.1
Mean Effective Gain (MEG)
The performance of a practical mobile antenna in its realistic operating environment
may be very different from what would be expected from measurements of the gain of
the antenna in isolation. This arises because the mobile is usually operated surrounded
by scattering objects that spread the signal over a wide range of angles around the mobile.
The question arises, given this complexity, as to what value of mobile antenna gain
should be adopted when performing link budget calculations. The concept of a mean
effective gain that combines the radiation performance of the antenna itself with the
propagation characteristics of the surrounding environment was introduced by Taga
(1990) to address this and is described in some detail here.
Consider a mobile antenna that receives power from a base station after scattering
has occurred through a combination of buildings, trees and other clutter in the
environment. The total average power incident on the mobile is composed of both
horizontally and vertically polarized components, PH and PV, respectively. All
powers are considered as averages, taken after the mobile has moved along a route
of several wavelengths. The mean effective gain (MEG) of the antenna, Ge, is then
deﬁned as the ratio between the power that the mobile actually receives and the total
that is available:
Prec
Ge 
(6.31)
PH  PV
The received power at the antenna can then be expressed in spherical coordinates taking
into account the three-dimensional spread of incident angles as follows:

where P1 and P2 are the mean powers that would be received by ideally θ (elevation) and
ϕ (azimuth) polarized isotropic antennas, respectively, Gθ and Gϕ are the corresponding
radiation patterns of the mobile antenna and Pθ and Pϕ represent the angular distribu­
tions of the incoming waves. The following conditions must be satisﬁed to ensure that

where mV and mH are the mean elevation angles of the vertically and horizontally
polarized components, respectively, σV and σH are the corresponding standard
deviations and Aθ and Aϕ are chosen to satisfy (6.34) and (6.35). The precise shape
of the angular distribution is far less important than its mean and its standard
deviation.
Since the arrival angle has been assumed uniform in azimuth, any variations from
omnidirectional in the radiation pattern will have no impact upon the MEG.
Although this assumption is likely to be valid in the long term as the mobile user's
position changes, there may be short-term cases where this is not so and the power
arrives from a dominant direction. This may particularly be the case in a rural setting
where a line-of-sight or near-line-of-sight path exists. Figure 6.29 shows the radiation
pattern obtained from a pair of dipoles arranged apart and fed with equal phase and
amplitude. This could, for example, represent an attempt to reduce radiation into the
human head by placing a null in the appropriate direction. This results in a gain
pattern of the form:

Also shown is the arrival angle distribution, assumed to be Gaussian in azimuth and
shown with a standard deviation of 50° and a mean of 0°. Calculation of (6.32) in
comparison with the assumption of a uniform arrival angle in the azimuth plane yields
the results shown in Figure 6.30. This is performed with the centre of the arriving waves
both within the pattern null and directly opposite and is shown as a function of the
standard deviation of the spread relative to the mean. Considerable gain reduction is
evident in both cases, particularly when the angular spread is small.

6.4.2
Radiation Pattern Extrapolation
An issue that has become more important for in-building antennas is that of ﬁnding gain
values everywhere in space. When performing propagation predictions in outdoor
environments, using the models described in Chapter 5, distances between base stations
and mobiles are large compared to the base station antenna height, and therefore the

signal would be estimated for radiation angles very near to the base station antenna
horizontal plane where the manufacturer typically speciﬁes the antenna radiation
pattern. However, for indoor cells, elevation angles typically span the whole range,
and hence simple extrapolation methods will lead to unacceptable prediction errors.
Two methods were found in the literature, both published in recent years, which seem
to address this extrapolation problem suitably. The ﬁrst one, published by Gil et al.
(1999), suggests that the generalized gain in any direction Pθ; ϕ, Gθ; ϕ is obtained
from the previous ones by weighting them with the relative angular distances between
the direction of interest and the horizontal θ2 and the vertical θ1; ϕ1; ϕ2 planes, that is
the four points on the sphere closest to the point of interest in Figure 6.31. The basic idea
of the model is that the weight by which the value of the gain on a given radiation plane is
inversely proportional to the angular distance, so that the closer the direction of interest

extrapolation is ensured on each plane.

where all the angles and gain values are deﬁned in Figure 6.31. This method is
recommended as an alternative for pattern extrapolation for indoor environments,
since, as reported in Aragón-Zavala (2003), when compared with anechoic chamber
measurements taken at various planes, it shows an improvement in accuracy of around

are speciﬁc elevation and azimuth angle combinations for which some degree of

The second method, presented in Vasiliadis, Dimitrou and Sergiadis (2005), combines
the two principal normalized patterns using 360° horizontal and 180° vertical gain
samples. The azimuth pattern is the planar cut at θ  π=2 while the elevation pattern is
the cut at ϕ  0. The authors deﬁne the logarithmic counterparts of these patterns as GH

The key idea of this method is that the estimation of a radiation pattern sample involves
data of the other principal pattern and is weighted as a function of angular distance
between the point of interest and the sample, in a cross-weighting manner between the
two principal cuts, which according to the authors, is more efﬁcient than the summing
algorithm or the angular distance weight model.

Prameter n can be optimized to minimize the estimation error. The optimum value of n
is thus associated with the directivity of the antenna under test. For patterns with
extreme directive characteristics, containing considerably more radiation nulls and
sidelobes, a parameter n  6 can provide satisfactory performance for all antenna types.
6.4.3
Reliability of Radiation Patterns
Antenna characteristics are very relevant when designing an indoor system, since the
performance of such a system depends strongly on some key parameters, especially the
radiation pattern. Interference and coverage can be properly controlled if the antenna
can be selected according to system requirements. Therefore, the correct antenna
selection strongly depends on the accuracy of antenna parameters provided by
manufacturers.
A comparison of antenna measurements performed in an anechoic chamber and the
radiation patterns provided by antenna manufacturers was made in Aragón-Zavala
(2003) to assess the accuracy of these data and the impact of the use of such patterns in
signal strength predictions.
Figure 6.32 shows the corresponding measured cuts for a directional antenna. It is
noticeable that the maximum absolute gain obtained from the anechoic chamber
measurements is less than that reported by the manufacturer at the frequency in whichFigure depicting measured radiation pattern plots for directional antenna.

it was tested, for both cuts. This difference never exceeds 2 dB, and hence is not
considered critical for design purposes. It may be caused by imperfections in the antenna
calibration prior to the anechoic measurements, as well as differences in the fabrication
and performance of different antennas, even if they are of the same type. The shape of the
pattern is very similar, although in the elevation cut the back lobe shows predominantly
higher gain than that reported by the manufacturer.
The error statistics of the comparison of measured absolute gain values and manu­
facturer data are presented in Table 6.1. The standard deviation of the error is relatively
low, and hence suggests that although there are discrepancies in various single gain
values in both planes, this degradation does not impose a major problem.
In summary, even though manufacturers supply radiation pattern data for all their
products at different frequencies, special care must be taken when using these patterns
for accurate propagation work having the following special considerations:
 The manufacturer measures the antenna radiation patterns in an anechoic chamber,
which is an ideal free-space style environment. Some manufacturers do not even
attempt to measure the patterns, but rather provide theoretical predictions based on
the radiation intensity equations they use. In practice, patterns may be heavily
distorted due to multipath, which tends to spread lobes and ﬁll nulls, or the presence
of objects near the antenna, distorting the pattern and affecting the VSWR.
 Unless the radiation pattern is used at the exact frequency at which the antenna
measurements were performed, there will be some uncertainty as to the exact values of
gain at the operating frequency and therefore approximations should be made.
 Individual antenna units, although manufactured having the same product number
and characteristics, may exhibit different performances.
Therefore it is much better to think of the antenna radiation pattern as a guide to the
areas that need to be illuminated rather than a precise beam for controlling coverage.
6.5
Antenna Measurements
The aim of antenna measurement techniques can be either to ensure that the antenna
under test (AUT) meets manufacturer speciﬁcations or simply to characterise it. These
measurements are often focused on speciﬁc antenna parameters, such as gain, radiation
pattern, bandwidth, beamwidth, impedance and power reﬂection.
As described before, the antenna pattern is the response of the antenna to a plane wave
incident from a given direction or the relative power density of the wave transmitted by
the antenna in a given direction. For a reciprocal antenna, these two patterns are
identical (reciprocity theorem). A multitude of antenna pattern measurement

Indoor Wireless Communications

techniques have been developed and are extensively used. Three methods will be brieﬂy
described here.
The ﬁrst technique developed was the far-ﬁeld range, where the AUT is placed in the
far-ﬁeld of a range antenna. Due to the size required to create a far-ﬁeld range for large
antennas, near-ﬁeld techniques were developed that allow the measurement of the ﬁeld
on a surface close to the antenna (typically 3 to 10 times its wavelength). This
measurement is then predicted to be the same at inﬁnity. A third common method
is the compact range, which uses a reﬂector to create a ﬁeld near the AUT that looks
approximately like a plane wave.
A typical (although not the only) scenario to perform antenna measurements is an
anechoic chamber. The anechoic chamber provides a controlled environment, an all-
weather capability, security and electromagnetic interference minimization. Before
calibration, it is necessary to set up a reference antenna, which is arranged in the
chamber as shown in Figure 6.33. The transmit antenna is stationary at one end of the
chamber while the reference antenna is placed on a turntable in the receive mode. The
two antennas are connected likewise to the appropriate ports of a network analyser
outside the chamber via feeder cables. It must be noted that the antennas need to be at
the correct height and aligned properly facing each other. Next, the receive antenna is
rotated at different angles, ﬁrst at a given plane (say the E-plane) and then at the
orthogonal plane (the H-plane), to obtain radiation pattern values at distinct angles.
More cuts can be achieved if desired, although manufacturers only provide horizontal
and vertical cuts.
Figure 6.34 shows an example of an anechoic chamber. Anechoic chambers are
normally wrapped with absorber materials to minimize reﬂection and other unwanted
propagation effects, which will alter the results of the radiation patterns.
6.6 MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output)
The most recent, and arguably most powerful, application of adaptive antennas is the
class of systems known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which use

201
6 AntennasFigure depicting anechoic chamber.

space-time coding (STC) to realize substantial performance and capacity gains. This
technology has been formally adopted by various wireless standards, amongst others
cellular LTE. The improvement in capacity due to this conﬁguration has been proved to
be far beyond what could be expected with SISO (single-input single-output) systems,
even with the use of advanced modulation and coding techniques. The fact that MIMO
takes the beneﬁt of multipath makes it more suitable for in-building wireless systems.
In MIMO systems, multiple antennas must be available at both the transmitter and the
receiver. These systems can then use STC to exploit the rich spatial multipath scattering
present in many radio channels. MIMO systems may be seen as the ultimate extension of
adaptive antenna technology to include diversity and SDMA as special cases, but being
more powerful than either.
Figure 6.35 MIMO concept.

202
Indoor Wireless Communications
A simple example is given in Figure 6.35. At the transmitter, an input bit stream is
divided into three parallel bit streams, each of which occurs at one-third the rate of the
original. Each of these is transmitted via an independent beamformer, which produces
three separate radiation patterns as a combination of the three transmit array elements.
The radiation patterns are chosen to produce a maximum gain in the directions of three
scatterers. Reradiation from each of these scatterers is received by three separate beams
formed at the receiver by three further beamforming networks. After demodulation, the
three bit streams can be recombined to produce the original input bit stream. Provided
the scatterers are sufﬁciently separated in angle to be resolved by the beams formed, the
three bit streams can all occupy the same spectrum without interfering, and the channel
capacity has been increased by a factor of three. Clearly the capacity gain from such a
system is limited by the amount of scattering in the multipath environment and by the
number of antenna elements available at both transmitters. Nevertheless, the potential to
increase channel capacity by a potentially unlimited degree offers great potential for high
bit-rate systems.
Many wireless technologies have started to incorporate MIMO in their standards; for
example, Wi-Fi 802.11n considers the use of MIMO to enhance the data throughput that
can be achieved; Wi-MAX also considers in its standard the use of MIMO to increase the
capacity of the link to levels that otherwise would not be achievable using only special
modulation and coding techniques; cellular 4G systems, such as LTE, also contemplates
the use of MIMO to enhance its capacity and minimize interference even further, taking
advantage of multipath propagation effects. To know more about MIMO systems, good
references can be found in Brown, Kyritsi and de Carvalho (2012) and Costa and Haykin
(2010).
In-building distributed antenna systems are now equipped with MIMO to enhance
the data performance in the building. In practice, only 2  2 conﬁgurations are feasible
due to installation restrictions. Alternatively, cross-polarized antennas can also be used
to minimize the space restrictions in MIMO and potentially larger conﬁgurations could
be possible.
The optimal antenna separation for MIMO to provide uncorrelated paths and thus
maximize MIMO performance is around 3 to 7 wavelengths. From this, it is evident
that the larger the frequency the easier it is to install MIMO within a restricted space;
this sets a trade-off between available bandwidth at large frequencies having a reduced
antenna separation against larger antenna separation and lower path loss at low
frequencies.
In Tolstrup (2011) some recommendations are given for practical indoor MIMO DAS
deployments. Some of these are summarized as follows:
 Do not place the antennas in the same cluster too far apart, as this potentially could
worsen the 'near-far' effect, where a mobile is close to one antenna.
 Both antennas should be visible to a mobile receiver, to avoid impacting on power
control and dynamic range.
 Ideally, both antennas should be placed so that they can service the same areas, for
example illuminating the same corridor; since this will result in a much more uniform
RF level between the two MIMO paths, taking advantage of the multipath and
scattering inside the building (less ISI).
 Ensure there is a good SNR in both MIMO paths.

203
6 Antennas
 The ideal antenna separation would also depend on the delay spread and wideband
channel characteristics of the local environment; for example recommended separa­
tions could be given for different types of environments with distinct wideband
channel characteristics.
 For multiband indoor solutions, the lowest frequency will dictate the antenna
separation.
 If passive MIMO DAS is to be used, two parallel DAS installations would be required,
thus increasing cost and complexity, using the same cable distance on both links to
avoid ISI.
6.7
Examples Of In-Building Antennas
Antennas that can be used for indoor wireless systems come in various shapes, sizes and
materials. Although it is not technology-speciﬁc, we will use the cellular industry as a
good example to show the requirements that indoor antennas must fulﬁl in a practical
deployment.
6.7.1
In-Building Cellular Antenna Requirements
In-building cellular antennas are a special type of antenna, which need to have distinct
characteristics to those for outdoor applications. These characteristics are not only
related to RF performance but also to physical properties and aesthetics. Some of the
most important requirements are:
 Discrete appearance, as people often are not keen on walking in front of a radiating
element, even if this radiation is harmless and non-ionizing. Also, aesthetically, they
should not represent an 'intrusion' to existing landscape within a building.
 Compliance with radiated power density and speciﬁc absorption rate (SAR) levels set
by international and local standards.
 Linear polarization is the preferred polarization state for in-building antennas;
although, for certain applications, circular polarization may also be used.
 High level of integration between systems and technologies deployed by different
operators, so wideband and multiband in-building antennas are increasingly of interest.
 Uniform coverage to illuminate the designated areas efﬁciently. This is especially
important for challenging in-building environments, in which multipath propagation
can cause the coverage to be non-uniform.
 Wide vertical beamwidth is of special importance, to illuminate ﬂoors above and
below. Horizontal beamwidth varies, depending on the application, and hence
omnidirectional or directional antennas can be chosen.
6.7.2
Omnidirectional
If coverage is to be provided in a facility with large spaces, such as halls, conference
rooms, airport terminals, etc., and antennas can be mounted on the ceiling, omni­
directional antennas are the preferred choice. Antenna locations are thus chosen so that
they are not mounted close to windows or external walls, and therefore signal spillage
can be better controlled.

204
Indoor Wireless Communications
Figure 6.36 Omnidirectional antennas: (a) ceiling-mounted; (b) comparison of an omni antenna with a
smoke detector.
An example of a ceiling-mounted antenna for indoor coverage at 900 MHz is shown in
Figure 6.36(a). A particular requirement of indoor antennas is a very wide beamwidth,
consistent with a discrete appearance, so this particular antenna has been designed to
look similar to a smoke detector, as shown in Figure 6.36(b). Linear polarization is
currently used almost universally for indoor communications, but there are potential
beneﬁts in the use of circular polarization. This has been shown to substantially reduce
fade depth and RMS delay spread due to the rejection of odd-order reﬂections as well as
reducing polarization mismatch loss. Similarly, a reduction in antenna beamwidth has
been shown to substantially reduce the delay spread in line-of-sight situations, but this
effect must be traded against the difﬁculty of providing a reasonably uniform coverage
area.
Increasingly, indoor antennas and the associated feed powers also typically have to be
compliant with speciﬁc requirements on radiated power density and speciﬁc absorption
rates. It is also increasingly desirable to achieve a high level of integration between the
systems and technologies deployed by different operators so wideband and multiband
indoor antennas are increasingly of interest, providing, for example, Wi-Fi, 3G and LTE
technologies in a single antenna housing.
For other wireless technologies, such as Wi-Fi, omnidirectional antennas may have
different shapes and conﬁgurations. The vast majority of wireless local area networks can
be found operating at two frequency bands: the 2.4 GHz ISM band (IEEE 802.11b and
802.11g standards) and the 5.4 GHz band (802.11a standard), with maximum data rates
from 11 Mbps (802.11b) up through to 54 Mbps (802.11g/a) and up to over 100 Mbps
(IEEE 802.11n, operating in either frequency band).
Spatial diversity is often employed in Wi-Fi access points to overcome multipath fading
effects and combine the various replicas of the received signal coherently, achieving
substantial spatial diversity gain. Indeed, in the 802.11n standard multiple antennas are an

205

absolute requirement to achieve high data rates. Omnidirectional antennas are preferred
for some applications, but this depends on whether uniform coverage is required; that is if
the access point and antennas are located in the middle of a room. In the early days of
WLAN, these antennas were external, as depicted in Figure 6.37.
Some WLAN access points have integrated antennas, which are often microstrip
elements, designed to provide coverage underneath the access point in an 'umbrella'
fashion (Figure 6.38). Floor penetration is sometimes difﬁcult to achieve, especially at the
relatively low transmit powers used in access points (50-200 mW EIRP depending on
the regulatory regime in the country of use).
For TV reception, omnidirectional antennas span from the early days of an analogue
TV loop (Figure 6.20) or dipole 'rabbit ears' (Figure 6.39a) to the most recent digital
HDTV era and more sophisticated designs (Figure 6.39b). Perhaps the impression we
have as users is that digital TV allows a much better reception than analogue, but thisPhotograph depicting Wi-Fi access point with integrated antennas.

may be a misleading conclusion; with poor SNR in analogue TV, 'snowy' or 'blurred'
images could be received, whereas in digital TV, one can go from perfect reception to
none at all almost instantly! Therefore, a good understanding of antenna characteristics
along with the right choice of antenna can be the difference between good and poor TV
service in a household or venue.
6.7.3
Directional
When coverage is to be maximized in a certain direction, the use of directional antennas
is recommended. Also, in circumstances where antennas cannot be mounted on ceilings
and only wall/pillar mounting is possible, directional antennas should be employed. In-
building directional antennas have narrow azimuth and elevation beamwidth, hence
allowing better coverage control in conﬁned areas such as corridors or tunnels. Due to
this reduced beamwidth, they are more directive and therefore their maximum gain is
higher than an omnidirectional one (around 5-7 dBi for directional panels).
Directional antennas are often wall-mounted, suitable for buildings with large walls or
pillars. These antennas can be very useful for sectorizing buildings and for containing
signals internally where the external wall loss is low and/or the macrocell interference
could be high. They also have a large front-to-back ratio to minimize back lobe radiation
and provide better leakage control.
Directional antennas are also used as donor macrocell antennas (when using repeat­
ers) or for bridging two buildings. For these cases, a Yagi-Uda is the preferred choice, due
to its high directivity and gain (around 17 dBi for UHF).
Popular models of directional antennas are shown in Figure 6.40. Note that most of
them are panels whose size depends on the speciﬁc frequency and application, but which
in most cases also have discrete appearance. If these antennas are wall-mounted, they
should not interfere with the wall design and the surrounding environment, making their
design rather simple.
In Wi-Fi systems, when coverage enhancement is required, especially for corridors,
tunnels or to connect two buildings, directional antennas with a narrow beamwidth are
employed. In this case, parabolic reﬂectors, Yagi-Uda antennas and phased-array panels

207
6 Antennas
Figure 6.40 Examples of indoor directional antennas: (a) sharksﬁn; (b) ﬂat panel.
are often used. As the number of channels that can be used is very limited (only three
non-overlapping channels in the 2.4 GHz band in the many countries where 11 or 12
channels are available), interference management and sectorization (also known as
zoning for indoor systems) is also important, and hence stringent directional require­
ments must be enforced to maximize system performance. Such high-gain antennas will
usually increase effective transmit power beyond the regulatory limits, so transmit power
from the access point should be reduced pro-rata; however, the gain is still effective in
increasing the range at the receiver.
6.7.4
Macrocell
Strictly speaking, macrocell antennas do not belong to the 'in-building' category.
However, they impact the design of an in-building radio system when installed in
macrocell sites and therefore the author believes they should be taken into consideration.
Panels are a common choice for macrocell directional antennas and are often used
close to buildings to guarantee some degree of outdoor-to-indoor penetration. These
panels are downtilted in the elevation plane to control coverage and hence minimize co­
channel interference with adjacent cells. However, there is a trade-off between how
much coverage can be obtained and the level of interference that is allowed; thus the C=I
parameter (carrier-to-interference ratio) is often used to delimit the maximum amount
of necessary downtilt.
A common way to control building penetration is also by adjusting the panel antenna's
orientation and downtilt.
These macrocell directional antennas have a larger horizontal beamwidth than the in-
building ones, to delimit sector coverage areas in three-sector or six-sector conﬁgura­
tions, depending on the technology.
6.7.5
Multiband
If various wireless technologies are to be deployed in a building and antenna locations
are restricted, site sharing may need to be the option for radio planners. The use of

208
Indoor Wireless Communications
multiband antennas is strongly encouraged under these circumstances, but be aware that
sometimes it is physically hard to achieve a wide frequency range in a single antenna
housing. Some common multiband antenna conﬁgurations are:
 Dual- or triple-band cellular, covering, for example, 800/1900/2.1 GHz bands for 2G/
3G/LTE.
 Cellular/Wi-Fi antennas, which cover the range 800 MHz to 2.5 GHz.
 The combination of various frequency bands that are required to be deployed in a
common housing.
It is very difﬁcult to design a single antenna element at a reasonable size for a broad
frequency range. There is often a compromise that needs to be made and if multiple
bands are needed; the elements or patches (depending on the speciﬁc antenna type or
technology) would then be fabricated separately and then merged within the same
housing. De-coupling distances should be maintained and thus bandwidth versus size
(including housing) is a trade-off.
Modern antenna design technologies allow smaller elements that can operate at larger
bandwidths. However, for practical multiband antennas, it is still not feasible to
construct single elements that could cover the entire band. Nevertheless, antenna sizes
permit easy installation and deployment, even within narrow spaces.
6.7.6
Deployment Considerations
The selection of antenna locations is very important in radio planning. Since coverage
can be optimized if the correct locations can be guaranteed, efforts are often made to
negotiate the installation of antennas in key places within a building. However, there are
some issues and considerations that need to be made, which are summarized as follows:
 Sometimes the best antenna locations for coverage are not necessarily the best for
installation,duetospaceorotherconstraints.Thus,theclosestlocationneedstobepursued.
 Antennas should be 'disguised' when deployed inside buildings - people often feel
'nervous' about having a radio element on top of their heads!
 There may be some areas of spaces where antennas cannot be deployed; for example
VIP lounges. Radio planners would then need to be prepared to select alternative
locations and still obtain good coverage.
 Omnidirectional antennas arebetter for large spaces to be deployedin a central location,
frequentlyontheceiling.Directionalantennaspreferablyare used toprovide coverageto
corridors or spaces for which the only option is to mount antennas on walls.
 When deploying distributed antenna systems, cable run paths need to be carefully
considered and taken into account, to avoid excessive losses due to long cables.
 Avoid installing omnidirectional antennas close to external walls or windows, since
uncontrolled leakage would be produced.
6.8 Radiating Cables
A radiating cable (leaky feeder) is a special type of coaxial cable where the screen is
slotted to allow radiation along the cable length, exhibiting controlled leakage provided
by slots in the outer conductor, as shown in Figure 6.41.

209
6 AntennasA schematic diagram of radiating cable, where outer jacket, slotted outer shield, and inner conductor are indicated by arrows. The prediction point is considered at a vertical distance "r" from the cable.
Figure 6.41 Radiating cable.
With careful design, a radiating cable produces virtually uniform coverage, which
makes it very suitable for areas where conﬁned coverage is desired; that is a path loss
exponent of unity. In open environments, local mean power falls off roughly as 1=r
(cylindrical waves).
6.8.1
Structure
The structure of a radiating cable is very similar to that of a coaxial feed, as seen in
Figure 6.42. The term 'leaky feeder' implies a type of coaxial cable with speciﬁc
characteristics.
The physical description of a radiating cable can be given starting from the inner parts
and moving towards the outer parts. At the centre of the cable there is a copper (Cu)
tube, ﬁlled with air from the inside. A low-loss foam polyethylene dielectric is used as an
insulator and separates the inner from the outer layer of copper foil. The last is
considered to be without thickness and with periodic slots that have various lengths,
shapes and distances to each other according to the mode that the cable is radiating.
Usually the outer conductor is also called the cable shield.
Figure 6.42 Internal structure of a radiating cable.

210
Indoor Wireless Communications
The cable jacket, which covers the external copper foil, is fabricated from materials
that depend on the environment in which the cable is going to be used. For example, it
might be ﬁre-retardant, low-smoke and fume, halogen-free or even resistant to corrosive
gases.
In order to maximize the effectiveness of the cable, its longitudinal attenuation must
be minimized. Materials used in cables are carefully selected according to their
performance and cost. As a result, the dielectric is usually foam polyethylene with
permittivity around 1.25 and wave velocity of about 88%.
6.8.2
Applications
Radiating cables were originally conceived to provide subterranean radio propagation,
for example in railway tunnels and coal mines. They are ideal for providing uniform
coverage in such locations, overcoming the complexity and potential uncertainty arising
from some propagation considerations when antennas are used. Radiating cables have
also been used as an alternative distribution system for in-building scenarios, especially
for areas that are difﬁcult to cover with conventional antennas such as long corridors and
airport piers.
A very attractive application for which radiating cables are used is for multioperator
wireless solutions, due to their large bandwidth. Therefore, many technologies can be
accommodated sharing the same transmission medium and hence optimizing the use of
resources and minimizing costs. For example, it is common to ﬁnd radiating cable
installationsinroadtunnelsforVHFbroadcasting aswellasUHFcellularcommunications.
6.8.3
Propagation Modes
There are two basic types of propagation modes and any other mode can be analysed as a
synthesis of those two. The ﬁrst one is the coupled mode, where the electromagnetic
energy is concentrated in the close vicinity of the cable; the second one is the radiating
mode, in which the energy is moving transverse to the cable (see Figure 6.43).
6.8.3.1
Coupled Mode
In this mode, the power ﬂow is parallel to the cable's axis. Cables operating in this mode
have lower longitude attenuation and higher coupling attenuation compared to those of
Figure  dep icting ra diati ng cable pr opagation modes. The first one is the coupled mode, where the electromagnetic energy is concentrated in the close vicinity of the cable; the second one is the radiating mode, in which the energy is moving transverse to the cable.

211

the radiating mode. These kinds of cables are used mainly in tunnels where the length of
the cable is large and the aperture of the coverage area is small. Due to its large coupling
loss, this mode does not perform well in open areas where the distance between the cable
and the receiver is large (typically larger than 15 m). The propagation mechanism of this
mode is based on scatters existing in the vicinity of the cable, while the absence of those,
theoretically, will lead to no radiation since all the energy will be conﬁned very close to
the cable.
6.8.3.2
Radiating Mode
Cables that work in this mode have large longitude attenuation and small coupling loss.
These cables are preferred for in-building environments like ofﬁces or airports where
usually the length of the cable is small (typically a few decades of metres) and the
coverage area wide. The propagation mechanism of this mode is based on in-phase
addition of all apertures. These modes appear only where there is a very well-deﬁned slot
arrangement and over a well-deﬁned radiated mode frequency, although they are not
narrowband. There is no tuning effect comparable to this encountered with antennas.
The main characteristics of the radiating mode are low scattering, deﬁnite waves and
high radiation.
6.8.4
Parameters
A radiating cable functions as both a transmission line and as an antenna. The radiating
slots are effectively individual antennas and propagation can be analysed as the
summation of all of these antennas individually. It is usually more convenient, however,
to analyse radiation from radiating cables as if the cable radiated continuously along its
length. The amount of radiation is quantiﬁed by two main parameters: coupling and
insertion (longitudinal) loss.
6.8.4.1
Coupling Loss
The coupling loss is deﬁned as the ratio between the power transmitted into the cable and
the power received by a half-wavelength dipole antenna located at a ﬁxed reference
distance from the cable in free space.
6.8.4.2
Insertion Loss
The insertion loss is a measure of the longitudinal attenuation of the cable, usually
expressed in decibels per metre at a speciﬁc frequency. For a given cable size, the
insertion loss increases as the frequency of operation increases.
6.8.4.3
Bandwidth
A very important property of the radiating cables, which makes them useful for
telecommunications and wireless applications, is that they are wideband; that is they
have a very large bandwidth. To understand this property, it must be considered that
only part of the cable is active for the calculation of the radiation in a given point and not
the whole cable. This condition implies limitation about the number of slots that are
going to be used for the calculations.
The bandwidth of a radiating cable depends strongly on the number of slots that exist
in one period.

Practical Considerations
Leaky feeders are an attractive solution for cellular coverage in areas difﬁcult to
illuminate with other distribution systems, such as tunnels, airport piers and long
corridors. For multioperator solutions, a leaky feeder often offers a viable solution, since
its reasonably large bandwidth can accommodate many frequency bands to support
multioperator designs.
When installing radiating cables, however, special care must be taken to ensure that
the cable is suspended carefully with reasonable separation from metal cabling trays and
other cables to avoid major impacts to its radiation characteristics. Compliance with ﬁre
and cable installation standards must also be taken into account.
For large tunnels, leaky feeders are also accompanied by bidirectional ampliﬁers or
repeaters, which amplify the signal when longitudinal losses are beyond acceptable limits.
Finally, when selecting or installing a radiating cable, various parameters should be
examined carefully, such as losses (coupling and insertion), operating frequency,
bandwidth, VSWR and size, which impact physical installation of the cable. Bear in
mind that special care should be taken when installing the radiating cable, to avoid
mounting it along metal surfaces. If the environment at which the cable is to be installed
requires it, ﬁre regulations compliance should be met for the chosen cable. Finally, cable
rigidity might be important if cable bends are to be done according to the designated
building geometry and areas in which the cable is to be installed.
6.9 Conclusion
Antennas are one of the key elements in a radio link, so this is the case for in-building
deployments. In fact, interference and leakage control could somehow be achieved
within a contained environment surrounded by walls and partitions, but could also in
principle become a challenge since the propagation environment is very complex. In
addition, antenna radiation pattern characteristics dictate the way antennas radiate or
receive radio waves, and thus careful antenna extrapolation methods need to be
considered for accurate prediction work.
Since people spend most of their time indoors, the aesthetics and size of in-building
antennas is crucial: the aim is to provide sufﬁcient coverage whilst being unnoticed. On
the other hand, antenna location selection comes from practice and experience, where a
strong compromise between location feasibility and radio performance needs to be
made.
Finally, for some hard-to-reach areas where the use of antennas to provide coverage is
not recommended, radiating cables offer a good alternative. Although this technology
has been on the market for many decades, it has only been in recent years that
installations have become less expensive and affordable for indoor wireless deployments.

Radio Measurements
When designing an in-building radio network, predictions using the models presented in
Chapter 5 allow us to check if the system requirements for the network are satisﬁed,
especially in terms of radio coverage, and initially an approximation can be made using
simulated data. However, in order to reﬁne the model accuracy and to validate whether
these predictions resemble reality, measurements are required. These measurements are
not only used for validating radio coverage levels but can also help to visualize the
wideband performance of the network, which in principle could limit the maximum
achievable data rate, depending on propagation conditions. This chapter outlines the
main characteristics of narrowband and wideband radio measurements often employed
in indoor wireless communications.
Radio measurements are therefore an essential ingredient of the overall in-building
design process. It is rather difﬁcult to visualize their importance if we have not analysed
in depth the motivation, beneﬁts and need for measurements. By the end of this chapter,
you are expected to have a clear understanding of the value of measurements for in-
building design projects; learn the different types of in-building measurement systems
and their characteristics; appreciate the impact of inaccuracies while performing
measurements; and learn various guidelines and recommendations for in-building
testing, which will assist you in your design.
The care and accuracy with which these measurements should be performed deter­
mine to a great extent the quality of the predictions and will affect the overall design
performance. Any radio engineer, researcher or designer should be aware of key
elements and observations that should be accounted for when performing indoor radio
measurements, and hopefully this chapter will provide this valuable information.
7.1
The Value of Measurements
So far, we have reviewed and understood antennas and propagation concepts to
dimension various radio networks, especially for indoor wireless communication
systems. Propagation modelling, as presented in Chapter 5, sets up the basis for
designing radio systems. These designs, in principle, work well on paper, as demon­
strated by various researchers and engineers in the past. However, how can we make sure
our system works appropriately for any building?

Indoor Wireless Communications
In planning a mobile communication network or developing mobile equipment, it is
essential to characterize the radio channel to gain insight into the dominant propagation
mechanisms (Chapter 4) that will deﬁne the performance experienced by users. This
characterization allows the designer to ensure that the channel behaviour is well known
prior to the system deployment, to validate the propagation models used in the design
process and to ensure that the equipment used provides robust performance against the
full range of fading conditions likely to be encountered. Furthermore, after a system has
been deployed, measurements allow ﬁeld engineers to validate crucial design parameters
that show how the system is performing and how it may be optimized. In summary,
measurements are a very useful tool for any radio system designer:
 To gain insight into key propagation mechanisms and validate the propagation models
used in the design. When we conduct measurements, we can validate that the theory
applies well in the real world, and even gain more information of special propagation
effects in challenging indoor environments.
 To characterize the radio channel, and in this way the radio system designer can make
decisions on the system's deployment and equipment speciﬁcations.
In the context of in-building scenarios, measurements can be used to:
 Tune parameters of empirical models
 Create synthetic channel models
 Determine existing coverage levels in a building or perform testing of new candidate
antenna locations (design survey) and
 Validate the design of a recently deployed system and test for compliance with
coverage requirements.
Figure 7.1 shows an example of what can be done with radio measurements. In the top
plot, measurements for an airport terminal were conducted for an antenna placed right
at the centre of the plot, in the GSM900 band (900 MHz). From these measurements, a
radio propagation model (lower left, red line) has been tuned with these measurements
(lower left, blue lines) - for this model, as seen in Chapter 5, path loss is changing with
distance according to a mathematical model for which the coefﬁcients have been tuned
with the measurements. An estimation of the percentile of area covered at least with a
certain signal strength level (lower right) can also be determined from measurements,
and this is regularly a requirement that needs to be satisﬁed for design acceptance.
Practical radio designs are very rarely performed to achieve a minimum signal strength
value within 100% of the designated area (coverage area).
7.1.1
Tuning Empirical Path Loss Models
This is usually the starting point for the rollout of any new network, whether in a new
frequency band or in a new environment. Detailed measurements are made of the path
loss for sites in a range of environments, and models of the propagation path loss are
ﬁtted to them for later application within planning tools. For example, Figure 7.2
shows typical measured values of the path loss as individual data points after removing
fast fading. The curve in the same ﬁgure represents an empirical power law model of
the form described in Chapter 5, ﬁtted to minimize the mean and the standard
deviation of the error between the model and the measurements. The mean error can

always be reduced to zero by choosing the model offset appropriately, so the usual way
of assessing the goodness of such a model is via the standard deviation of the
differences between the measurements and predictions. In the case illustrated the
error standard deviation is 4.7 dB, with an error mean of only 0.05 dB, which is typical
of a well-ﬁtted model. Accurate measurements are therefore crucial in achieving an
accurate path loss model.

7.1.2
Creating Synthetic Channel Models
When developing and characterizing base or mobile station equipment, it is often
necessary to subject the equipment to the full range of signal variations that will be
encountered in practical operation. However, it is often desirable to do this in a
repeatable fashion, so that different equipment can be directly compared without
introducing measurement uncertainties. In such situations a synthetic channel model
may be used, implemented in hardware and/or software, which produces entirely
realistic channel variations in a laboratory environment. Although the channel is
synthetic in such systems, the starting point is always extensive ﬁeld trials to accurately
determine the variation of the statistical parameters of the channel with the
environment.
Measurements for this purpose will typically involve the detailed capture of both
wideband and narrowband fading statistics, carefully indexed to the locations and
environments in which they are recorded. This facilitates detailed subsequent analysis
to determine the dependence of channel parameters on the environments in which they
are experienced. These parameters are stored and loaded into a channel simulator to
replicate given environments.
7.1.3
Validating Indoor Radio Designs
Once an in-building radio system has been deployed in a venue, measurements assist
radio planners and engineers to assess the performance of the system against various test
parameters, such as trafﬁc load, interference, full power capacity, etc. This is the point at
which adjustments can be made to the network and ﬁne parameter tuning is performed.
Without a way to verify coverage levels, quality-of-service parameters, handovers,
leakage, capacity thresholds, etc., it would be impossible to ﬁnalize the design process.
Accurate measurements are thus also needed here, which, in some cases and depending
on contractual obligations, may need to be conducted periodically.
7.2 Methodology for Indoor Measurements
The indoor radio measurement process constitutes an essential ingredient for any
specialized in-building radio engineer, since measurements are a valuable asset that
accompany any indoor radio design. Therefore, before going into the speciﬁcs of these
measurements, an overview of the entire process is needed.
7.2.1
Measurement Campaign Plan
The very ﬁrst step in any measurement process needs to be a document that states all the
details of the measurements that are to be taken. At this stage, indoor radio planners and
designers decide which type of measurements need to be done, the venue (or venues) and
locations, frequency bands, characteristics of the measurements, the type of equipment,
an anticipated schedule, etc. A more in-depth view of a measurement campaign plan
(MCP) is given in Section 7.6.1.

219
7 Radio Measurements
7.2.2
Preliminary Site Visit
A visit to the building under consideration may be required to identify areas in which
measurements can be performed (walk routes), potential test antenna locations, etc.
Photos are often taken and archived here, for their inclusion in the MCP document.
Sometimes this preliminary visit allows radio planners to gather some existing coverage
levels from surrounding macrocell sites or other wireless technologies, which will help
them plan ahead the measurement campaign.
7.2.3
Site Acquisition and Permissions
Once the measurement campaign plan has been ﬁnalized, site acquisition is next.
Permissions to have access to certain areas of the designated venue need to be granted, as
well as security clearance for some high-security buildings, such as airports. The
measurement campaign plan document accompanied by an ofﬁcial letter from the
company responsible for the measurements is often enough to have access to the site.
7.2.4
Equipment Checklist
In the MCP there is a section that deals with test equipment to be utilized in the
measurement campaign. All equipment, especially transmitters, receivers and antennas,
must be checked and veriﬁed for calibration prior to the measurement date, to guarantee
that accurate data are to be gathered.
7.2.5
Measurement Campaign
Measurements are conducted on the speciﬁed date for which access to the site has been
granted. Data needs to be recorded and backed up and photos taken as part of the
measurement report.
7.2.6
Data Postprocessing
Although not necessarily an essential part of the measurement process, sometimes the
postprocessing of data may need to be performed during the measurement campaign
and therefore needs to be included in the process. Sometimes this is only done to validate
the collected data. If this is the case, it may be called a 'fast-track' postprocessing, just to
verify that the data collection was correct. The 'full' postprocessing would then need to
be performed back at the ofﬁce.
7.2.7
Postvisit to Site
For network validation, once the in-building radio solution has been installed, measure­
ments may be required, and a site revisit will need to be planned and scheduled. It is
better to consider this in the initial site acquisition step, although sometimes this may
not be possible and a second round of negotiations would then need to be done.

Indoor Wireless Communications
7.3 Types of Measurement Systems
Before going to the speciﬁcs of radio measurement equipment, let us examine brieﬂy the
two types of measurement systems available for radio measurements. These are
narrowband channel sounding and wideband channel sounding.
7.3.1
Narrowband Measurements
To characterize the narrowband behaviour of the mobile radio propagation channel,
continuous wave (CW) measurements are often performed by transmitting an
unmodulated single tone carrier. Note that the path loss is essentially a narrowband
effect so that CW measurements are adequate for most path loss models, although the
UWB (ultra-wideband) system path loss is a possible exception.
A ﬁxed radio transmitter is often employed for such measurements, connected to
many test antennas, and the mobile receiver is carried by a pedestrian user or is even on a
mobile robot platform. Occasionally the receiver remains ﬁxed and the base station is
moved to perform the narrowband measurements, which is particularly useful if it is
desired to compare signal paths between multiple base stations and a mobile location.
An example of narrowband channel testing equipment can be seen in Figure 7.3. Note
that for the measurements that were undertaken there, a radio scanner along withPhotograph depicting typical narrowband indoor testing equipment: (a) radio scanner; (b) antenna under test mounted on a tripod.

software installed in a laptop was used as the receiver equipment, whereas antennas were
deployed on tripods and located at the candidate tested antenna locations.
Portable spectrum analysers as shown in Figure 7.4 can also be employed for speciﬁc
narrowband measurements, such as the one shown here with a fabricated dipole
antenna, for hidden node margin measurements (Aragón-Zavala, Brown and Castañón,
2016). This facilitates the collection of samples at speciﬁc frequency bands that may not
be available in many commercial radio scanners.
Sometimes portable spectrum analysers may not be available for indoor measure­
ments and alternative solutions are employed. Figure 7.5 shows a ZVL6 spectrum
analyser from Rhode and Schwarz that was employed for speciﬁc correlation measure­
ments, for which repeatability was important and relevant and therefore a trolley was
used to support the ZVL6 (Aragón-Zavala, Jevremovic and Jemmali, 2014). Conﬁgura­
tions similar to this are often encountered in research projects.
For indoor radio coverage design, narrowband measurements are employed to
determine coverage and leakage levels. The ones that are frequently used in the market
are continuous wave (CW), code-scanning and engineering test mobiles.
7.3.1.1
CW Measurements
A generic narrowband channel sounding system is presented in Figure 7.6. Notice that,
depending on the environment in which the measurements are to be performed (indoor
or outdoor), the navigation and positioning system changes. Annotations have been
made to indicate the cases for in-building testing use.
The data acquisition system is normally composed of a laptop computer that has
specialized data acquisition software installed, and includes all the interfacing drivers to
communicate with the receiver and navigation and positioning systems. Signal envelope
or phase measurements can be performed with the above-mentioned system, and the
design of the receiver determines whether this amplitude or phase is measured. If phase
is of interest, then this phase can be measured relative to a ﬁxed reference, by
demodulating the signal in two channels; that is in-phase and quadrature. In some
applications the absolute phase might be required and then it is required that the local

tion measurements.Photograph depicting spectrum analyser mounted on a trolley to perform special narrowband correlation measurements.
oscillators of transmitter and receiver are phase-locked, and hence only phase variations
due to propagation characteristics are recorded.
When selecting measurement receivers, the dynamic range is an essential parameter
to take into account, since this will determine both the maximum signal strength that
can be detected as well as the receiver noise ﬂoor. For example, for in-building
measurement campaigns in which large distances are to be covered, a large dynamic
range is desired, especially if the transmitter can only be placed at a distant location from
many rooms that are of interest. Furthermore, the maximum signal strength that can be
recorded is often of interest here if walk tests are performed very close to the trans­
mitting antennas. In all cases, the full extent of signal fast fading has to be considered
within the required dynamic range.
The ﬁrst type of narrowband measurements we will analyse are CW measurements.
They are used to characterize the narrowband behaviour of the mobile radio propagation
channel. CW testing is also quite adequate for tuning path loss models, especially if
accurate propagation work is required - we are interested in the radio propagation of an
unmodulated carrier throughout a building, rather than on speciﬁc network-related
issues.

223
7 Radio Measurements
Figure 7.6 CW measurement system for in-building radio testing.
For CW work, the transmitter is situated at a ﬁxed location and an unmodulated single
tone carrier is transmitted, as shown in Figure 7.7. The receiver (often a radio scanner) is
carried by the person conducting the measurements, as depicted in Figure 7.8. Special
care must be taken to hold the receive antenna at an average person's height, to avoid
coupling with the body. The dynamic range of the receiver is essential to determine the
maximum detected signal strength and the receiver noise ﬂoor.
As CW measurements only use unmodulated single tone carriers, they are not suitable
for measuring network performance and therefore other narrowband measurement
equipment should be used.
7.3.1.2
Code Scanning
Code scanning is used for 3G cellular systems to log all the decoded cells, scrambling
codes and CPICH (pilot) levels when performing a measurement campaign. Typically,Photograph depicting transmitter and antenna for a CW measurement, where antenna and CW transmitter is indicated by arrows.

the user deﬁnes the start and end channels and the code scanner will scan and measure
all the channels in the speciﬁed range. The purpose of this channel scan in 3G systems is
to measure potential pilot polluters, ﬁnd unexpected neighbours and establish the
baseline for the noise level of the radio channel.
7.3.1.3
Engineering Test Mobiles
Engineering test mobiles are used when mobile network parameters are to be monitored,
such as handover failures, idle/dedicated mode call statistics, blocking issues, dropped
call rates, interference effects affecting network performance, network benchmarking,
etc. This method is used only with operating mobile networks, and although test mobiles
can measure signal strength levels, their accuracy and dynamic range are not sufﬁcient
for accurate propagation modelling work. A couple of examples of in-building mea­
surement systems using engineering test mobiles include TEMS (Ascom) and E6474A
indoor wireless measurement system (Agilent). Figure 7.9 shows an example of a radio
engineer conducting an in-building radio survey using engineering test mobiles.
One of the advantages of engineering test mobiles is that they can resemble user's
experience within the network, so they are very useful for validation or benchmarking
testing. They also can assist operators in detecting failures and adjusting network
parameters, not necessarily related to coverage.
Amongst the limitations of test engineering mobiles is their limited accuracy for signal
strength measurements, which make them appear as a not viable alternative for
propagation prediction work.
7.3.1.4
Comparative Analysis
A comparative table for the three narrowband measurement systems described earlier is
shown in Table 7.1. Note that although test engineering mobiles lack sufﬁcient accuracy
for propagation prediction work, CW measurements can perform this task very well, and
complement each other with test engineering mobiles as the network performance
analysis that cannot be performed using CW testing can be done without any problem

are measurement campaigns whose aim and scope is such that two or more of these
systems need to be used.
7.3.2
Wideband Measurements
Wideband channel parameters such as delay spread, delay proﬁle, average delay and
coherence bandwidth are of special interest when channel characterization is desired and
are especially important for system performance. Various techniques may be employed,
some of which use the principle of transmitting many narrowband signals, either
sequentially or simultaneously. However, due to the limitations of the above-mentioned
methods, genuine wideband sounding techniques are required. Examples of such
techniques are periodic pulse sounding and pulse compression.
An example of the use of an Elektrobit wideband channel sounder for MIMO
measurements is shown in Figure 7.10, where an 18  8 MIMO conﬁguration was tested.
There are various wideband measurement procedures that can be carried out either in
the time domain or in the frequency domain. For the time domain case, the impulse
response of the channel is measured. On the other hand, for the frequency domain, the
frequency response or transfer function of the channel is measured.
The impulse response of the channel can be measured either by transmitting a short
pulse or by transmitting a wideband spread-spectrum signal. In the short duration pulse
case, the received signal is sampled; that is the convolution of the pulse with the channel's
impulse response. Thus, the ratio of peak to average power must be high in order to
detect the low power multipath. In the wideband spread-spectrum case, the signal is
modulated by a pseudo-random sequence and the receiver signal is correlated with the
original signal. In this case, the duration of the signal must be short compared to the
channel coherence time.

227
7 Radio MeasurementsFigure depicting measurement system used to obtain the channel's frequency response.
Figure 7.11 Measurement system used to obtain the channel's frequency response.
For the frequency domain approach, the frequency response is directly measured.
Figure 7.11 shows an example of a measurement system using a network analyser as the
main component. Thus, it is possible to obtain the channel's impulse response by
applying the inverse Fourier transform to the obtained frequency response.
The transmit antenna (antenna TX) is plugged to one of the network analyser ports
and a set of discrete frequencies f k  f 0  kΔf is swept, with 0  k  N, having equal
increments Δf . At the same time, N complex samples of the channel's frequency
response H k  are measured in the receiver antenna (antenna RX), connected to the
other port of the network analyser. Assuming that f 0  0, the baseband complex
frequency response of the channel is (Monk and Wingbier, 1956)

where βi, τi and ϕi represent the magnitude, arrival time and phase, respectively, of the L
individual paths. Since the measurement system is band-limited, the system measures
windowed frequency characteristics of the channel. Thus, the measured frequency

7.4 Measurement Equipment
7.4.1
Transmit Equipment
Transmitters produce the signal used for the measurements, especially in those cases
where antennas need to be deployed at speciﬁc locations, and there are issues that need
to be monitored to make sure errors will not be produced. An example of a Rohde and
Schwarz signal generator often employed for in-building radio testing is depicted in
Figure 7.12.
To start with, transmitters should undergo calibration and validation periodically, to
verify that manufacturer's speciﬁcations are still being met and especially prior to the
measurement campaign.
Transmitters should transmit signal levels at the speciﬁed power and at a given
frequency, maintaining a degree of frequency stability. Since transmitters are active
devices, they are subject to change of performance parameters with temperature,
humidity, supply voltage variations, etc. Selection of the transmitter to use must account
for a compensation of these effects in order to minimize frequency and power drifts.
Another issue with transmitters has to do with their power supply. If power supply is a
signal generator, the performance of the transmitter may be jeopardized by the
generator's transients, noise and voltage variations, so a careful monitoring of power
supply levels is of importance. On the other hand, if the power supply is a battery, the
output frequency and power must be checked when operating over large periods of time,
preventing battery discharge periods and having if possible available redundant batteries.Photograph depicting transmitter employed for in-building radio testing.

Additional transmit equipment should be used along with the radio transmitter to
support the measurement campaign. The following items are usually required:
 Tripod for supporting the antenna (see Figure 7.3b), preferably made of nylon or wood
to avoid disturbing the propagation environment being measured. For radiating
cables, suitable support tools should also be used (Figure 7.13).
 Signal source, carefully calibrated and preferably placed at a well-ventilated place, to
avoid changes in power and frequency stability due to an increase in temperature.
 Full-charged main and spare battery packs for battery-powered transmitters.
 Coaxial jumper cables and connectors, with the corresponding RF adapters to
properly ﬁt any type of connector in the cables to any connector installed in the
transmit equipment and antenna.
 In-building transmit antennas, of the type and frequency according to the campaign
speciﬁcations and characteristics.
7.4.2
Receive Rquipment
Receivers should be selected according to the speciﬁc characteristics of the measurement
campaign. For example, if coverage is desired for accurate propagation prediction work,
then a CW transmitter should be employed using a radio scanner. If 3G code scrambling
is to be performed, then code scanners are to be selected. Engineering test mobiles are
chosen when network performance parameters are to be monitored, as well as bench­
marking amongst operators and when parameters are to be optimized, after the system
has been deployed.
One of the key parameters to consider for in-building measurements for receivers is
their dynamic range, to make sure distant rooms and areas can still be tested without
reaching the receiver's noise ﬂoor. This is particularly important for large facilities such
as airports, retail stores or shopping centres.
Signal reception can be achieved using spectrum analysers, radio scanners or
engineering test mobiles, as discussed earlier. In all cases, accurate measurements

230
Indoor Wireless Communications
strongly depend on the periodicity of which calibration is performed on the receivers, to
guarantee signals are within speciﬁed limits.
Finally, receivers must be calibrated prior to commencing the measurement cam­
paign, to guarantee that any measurement uncertainties can be known and measurement
errors can be compensated.
A signal of known power from a well-calibrated signal generator can be injected at the
frequency of interest and samples of the recorded signal strength by the scanner will
need to be within these injected values. The frequency range is varied as well as the
transmitter power, to cover the entire dynamic range of the radio scanner. The
transmitter employed should be a carefully calibrated laboratory signal generator and
the received signal strength can be compared with a calibrated spectrum analyser, as the
known reference.
If channels are to be scanned over a wide frequency range, then it is important to
ensure that the receiver is calculated at least at the extremes and centre of the
measurement range to determine whether any signiﬁcant differences exist.
Several issues should be taken into account when preparing receive equipment for a
measurement campaign. These are listed as follows:
 Full-charged main and spare battery packs should be taken.
 The chosen measurement receiver should be calibrated and packed according to
measurement campaign needs. It might be the case that two or more types of receivers
could be required if many types of testing need to be performed in the same
measurement campaign; for example propagation measurements and existing cover­
age for benchmarking.
 Antenna and mounting arrangements are to be considered for the walking person
conducting the measurements. Receive antenna height should be clear of head sight if
propagation measurements are to be performed. Also, it is usually better to use an
antenna that does not require a ground plane, to avoid radiation pattern distortion
(e.g. a sleeve dipole).
 A portable computer must be prepared with the collection software and drivers
installed. It is important to bear in mind that preferably special laptops/palmtops are
to be used here, since come portable computers may be sensitive to motion and their
hard disk can be damaged. Ruggedized portable computers are the preferred option
for in-building measurements.
 Also, make sure that the ﬂoorplan of the building to be measured has been imported
into the collection software, and depending on the type of testing, even external areas
may be needed.
7.4.3
Miscellaneous Testing Components
Passive elements, such as cables, attenuators, antennas and splitters (Figure 7.14) form
an integral part of a measurement system. These elements, although reasonably stable,
do suffer degradation with time and therefore periodic validation of their main RF
properties is required. Passive elements are frequently the cause of measurement failures
in ﬁeld systems. RF connectors must be tightened to the correct torque, as recommended
by the manufacturer. If they are too loose they will produce intermittent errors, which
are hard to diagnose and introduce additional loss into the system. If they are too tight

231
7 Radio MeasurementsPhotograph depicting examples of passive elements used in a measurement survey: (a) coaxial cables; (b) connectors; (c) attenuators; (d) RF feeder; (e) antennas.

they will deform, causing a change in the presented electrical impedance and inducing
unwanted reﬂections within the transmission line. Mechanical vibration in the mobile
then effectively varies the transmission line impedance dynamically, causing severe and
unpredictable variation in the system calibration. Most RF connectors are only rated to
several hundred mating cycles, so cables and connectors used for ﬁeld measurement
work should be replaced at regular intervals.
It is important to use cables with an appropriate speciﬁcation: for example, cables with
50Ω and 75Ω characteristic impedance look identical but will not operate correctly.

232
Indoor Wireless Communications
Cables degrade swiftly when used in ﬁeld measurement systems, producing additional
losses and unwanted reﬂections. This may occur, for example, due to corrosion or to the
cable being bent to too small a radius. A measurement with a network analyser can check
both the loss and impedance of a cable. A specialized time domain reﬂectometer is also a
useful tool for characterizing and locating any cable faults. This operates by sending
short pulses along a cable and measuring the time and amplitude of the reﬂections.
Antennas are elements that should not be neglected from this validation process, as
for very accurate propagation measurements, a few decibels in antenna gain or decimal
places in VSWR can be critical. Therefore, ideally, a radiation pattern characterization at
least in azimuth and elevation at the operating frequency would be desired, as well as a
VSWR measurement over its operating frequency range to evaluate how much power
will not be radiated from the antenna. This is essential for antennas that have been
designed speciﬁcally for the measurement campaign plan but is optional if the antennas
are purchased from known and recognized antenna manufacturers. Ideally the antenna
radiation pattern would be characterized in situ, but typically it is sufﬁcient to use a
standard test route with known characteristics to establish an appropriate value for the
mean effective gain (MEG). The key point is to regularly monitor the antenna character­
istics over time and ensure that the same setup is used through a given measurement
campaign.
Finally, some accessories are highly recommended to take along with transmit and
receive equipment, which are described as follows:
 Power meter, to conﬁrm power measurements. This is very important, especially for
propagation prediction measurements, as the link budget needs to take an accurate
ﬁgure of transmit power for path loss calculations.
 Digital camera to record all the locations of the transmit antenna. This is useful, for
when performing the analysis of the collected data, it is much easier to refer to the
surrounding environment of the tested antenna location to understand some of the
propagation effects taking place there.
 Temporary security barriers, if equipment is to be left unattended in a public place for
any length of time. Signs should also be placed indicating that RF transmit equipment
is active and caution should be taken by the general public not to touch any of the
devices and equipment.
 Paper copy of the building ﬂoor plans, as it is often easier to identify on paper speciﬁc
areas of the building, prior to loading the digital map in the collection portable
computer.
 Clipboard, to hold any relevant documents (permissions, ﬂoorplans, etc.).
 Measuring tape or electronic laser measure, as the measurement of distance may be
required.
 Tape measure and compass.

Buyer's Guide
An example of some equipment vendors for in-building measurement equipment
include:
 Andrew (transmitters, receivers, antennas, radiating cables)
 Anritsu (transmitters, receivers, power metres)

233

 Rohde & Schwarz (transmitters, receivers)
 Agilent (transmitters, receivers)
 PCTEL (receivers)
 Motorola (receivers)
 Sagem (receivers)
 Tektronix (receivers)
 Kathrein (antennas)
 RFS (radiating cables).
These are amongst the most popular and known, but by no means the only ones. Also,
bear in mind a few recommendations when buying test equipment:
 Price: need to assess cost versus beneﬁt. Prices may change for equipment of similar
characteristics between two vendors.
 Technical speciﬁcations meeting measurement requirements: buy the equipment that
you are to use for many measurement campaigns according to the type of technology,
the type of testing, etc. If it is a 'one-off' test, it might be much better to rent the
equipment for a number of days only.
 Upgrades: as wireless technology is progressing fairly quickly, the test equipment
needs to be upgradeable; otherwise it tends to become obsolete in a short period of
time.
 Technical support: when things go wrong, it is much better to have a vendor who is
really proving high-quality customer support than someone not interested in helping
you out! Be careful, as this is something every vendor offers, but not all provide with
the highest quality. It is useful to get recommendations from other people who have
bought similar equipment.
7.5
Types of Indoor Measurement Surveys
The types of measurement surveys can be classiﬁed differently, according to the type of
environment or the characteristics of the measurement campaign. For example, when
designing radio systems, drive testing is used for getting samples from various locations
around a large transmitting cell, such as a macrocell-type base station. This is applicable
for cellular, Wi-MAX or satellite-based terrestrial coverage. However, if the measure­
ments are to be conducted inside buildings, for instance, for Wi-Fi or cellular, in-
building measurements are to be performed. Since our end-of-chapter propagation
experiment is related to conducting measurements inside several buildings in your
university campus, our focus on this section will be on highlighting special techniques
and guidelines to conduct radio measurements inside buildings.
7.5.1
Design Survey
When designing a new portion of a mobile network for any cell type (macro, micro or
picocell), it is common to conduct site-speciﬁc surveys to ensure that any design
assumptions made are valid. For example, while propagation models may be used to
determine an appropriate general location for a new macrocell, a survey may be
conducted to ensure that a speciﬁc proposed base station location provides coverage

234
Indoor Wireless CommunicationsFigure depicting design survey example. Each point represents a signal strength sample and the colour bar indicates the signal strength level. The tested antenna is depicted with an arrow indicating the direction of maximum radiation (boresight).
Figure 7.15 Design survey example.
in particular locations, which is difﬁcult to do with complete conﬁdence with any
propagation model. While a good macrocell prediction model may achieve an 8dB
standard deviation of error, well-conducted and calibrated measurements should be
repeatable with a standard deviation as low as around 3dB.
Similarly, in an indoor environment, it is often important to conduct surveys from
some or all of the proposed antenna locations in order to validate initial assumptions
made concerning the properties of the building materials or the detailed building
construction geometry. It is also important to check the coverage of the existing systems,
particularly for licence-exempt bands such as those used by Wi-Fi systems, for which no
central record of potential interferers exists.
An example of a design survey is shown in Figure 7.15. Each point represents a signal
strength sample and the colour bar indicates the signal strength level. The tested antenna
is shown with an arrow indicating the direction of maximum radiation (boresight).
7.5.2
Existing Coverage
Ongoing measurements are conducted by network operators to determine the perform­
ance of their network. These may be compared to previous measurements, revealing the
impact of network changes intended to optimize performance or the impact of changing
user trafﬁc patterns. They may also be used to benchmark network performance against
alternative operators or network technologies. Such measurements may simply be of
signal strengths, but more usually they involve measuring a large number of parameters
simultaneously in order to determine the experience of a real customer and to relate this
to the network parameters, both RF and logical.
For example, it is common to place repetitive voice calls using mobile phones in an
engineering mode and to determine the proportions of such calls that are dropped or
subject to blocking. It is increasingly common to also measure the data performance that

235
7 Radio Measurements
may be experienced by users in the form of measurements of throughput, latency and
other quality-of-service indicators. Simultaneously, the measurement system must log
the network state and signalling trafﬁc, to determine the network messages such as
handover commands and mobile measurement reports, which will help to diagnose the
causes of any problems and suggest actions to be taken to optimize performance in the
future.
7.6
Guidelines for Effective Radio Measurements
We have appreciated the importance of measurements for in-building design work,
including many aspects within the process: for tuning and validating propagation
models, for determining existing coverage in a new site, to identify coverage holes,
to decode channels to ﬁnd potential pilot polluters in 3G, to assess network performance
of recently deployed in-building cellular systems or simply to optimize parameters. The
issue now has to do with how to conduct such measurement campaigns in order to get
the most beneﬁt from them, having as a result accurate measurements that could be
used. This involves planning the measurement campaign and, once a plan is in place,
conducting such measurements efﬁciently. This topic aims at reviewing these two
aspects in radio measurements: planning and execution (conducting).
Many of the issues related to outdoor measurements also apply indoors, but there are
further considerations relating speciﬁcally to the methods of navigation and choice of
measurement locations. Since this book is totally dedicated to indoor wireless systems,
we will focus our attention on guidelines for effective indoor radio measurements. For a
more detailed discussion on the issues and guidelines related to outdoor measurements
as well, refer to Saunders and Aragón-Zavala (2007).
7.6.1
Planning Your Measurements: The MCP
In Section 7.2.1 and as part of the indoor radio design methodology, a measurement
campaign plan (MCP) was mentioned. A measurement campaign plan is a document
that establishes the requirements and planning needed for the propagation testing to be
performed. This plan encompasses essential issues such as motivation, general mea­
surement requirements, base station locations, testing routes, testing guidelines, work-
plan and required equipment checklist. Some of these issues will be discussed in more
detail in this section.
The importance of having a measurement campaign planned in advance relies on
more than being a simple checklist document. The aims and goals of what is to be
achieved after the testing are often overlooked and should not be minimized. Time is
sometimes critical, especially when the measurements are performed in public areas
where permission is given only for a limited timeframe. Therefore, careful planning is
essential if successful results are to be obtained.
The MCP aims to give a brief introduction to the measurement campaign, including
some background and scope, which is required here to stress the importance of
conducting measurements as part of a project. To support this, a standard documents
background can be included for reference. This assists the building owner, for example,
who grants permission to access the building site for the measurements, a general

236
Indoor Wireless Communications
overview (without too much technical information) of the measurement campaign and
why it is important.
7.6.1.1
Introduction
The introductory part normally establishes a baseline for the measurements, but is often
not enough. An explanation of what drives engineers, planners, scientists or whoever is
to conduct the measurements is also required, to justify the main 'motivation' for the
measurements. This is usually a statement that describes and explains the purpose of the
measurements. It should be precise, clear and catches the attention of the reader, as it
often justiﬁes the need for the measurement campaign.
7.6.1.2
Objectives
As part of the MCP, there is also a need to deﬁne clear, achievable and measurable
objectives. These objectives will be used as a basis for future evaluation of the
measurement campaign. Often building owners want to make sure that whoever is
conducting the measurements has clear objectives in mind - in a way, they want to
understand that the measurement campaign is 'worthwhile' and that it must be
conducted to achieved speciﬁc targets.
As an example of the deﬁnition of motivation and objectives in an MCP, let us suppose
that the project consists of determining the existing coverage of four GSM operators in
an airport, for benchmarking purposes, and that the survey is conducted on behalf of
operator A (B,C and D are the remaining three GSM operators). A way to write the main
motivations for this work could read like this: 'Establish a coverage comparison amongst
the four GSM operators in the airport, to assess market penetration of operator A, in
order to take further actions to improve their coverage at certain areas.' This brings the
attention of the airport authorities as they may see the beneﬁt for airport users in
achieving better signal quality.
In terms of objectives, they could be as follows:
 Determine existing coverage levels for operator A in critical areas within the airport,
for GSM, to identify coverage holes.
 Establish a comparison of the extent of coverage with the other operators (B,C and D)
to identify the market penetration for operator A in the airport.
7.6.1.3
Requirements
The requirements section in an MCP establishes testing requirements depending on
many factors, such as technology, equipment availability, design requirements, opera­
tor's requirements, and what is to be done with the measurements. When specifying
requirements in the MCP, for example, a speciﬁc test equipment to use is speciﬁed, how
repeatable should the measurements be, sampling and averaging requirements (espe­
cially if fast fading is to be gathered) as well as the type of sampling that is needed
(distance or time).
To understand these requirements for the measurement campaign better, let us take
our benchmarking existing coverage exercise for operator A in an airport example.
Technical requirements for these measurements could be:
 Accurate measurements are needed for propagation modelling, so CW measurements
are to be used.

237
7 Radio Measurements
 GSM and UMTS sites are to be deployed, thus transmitters and receivers at these
frequency bands are required.
 The operator has speciﬁed to take samples in 1m bins and to average using linear
power; thus receiver equipment must be selected to guarantee that this requirement is
fulﬁlled so that sufﬁcient samples are taken, and averaging is performed in
postprocessing.
 Repeatability is needed for the measurement campaign, to assess cross-correlation
factors. Therefore, a line track on the ﬂoor is created and followed for each
measurement.
7.6.1.4
Antenna Locations
Prior to the measurements, test antenna locations must be selected according to the type
of campaign and the scope that is desired for this. These antenna locations are chosen
according to knowledge of the building under consideration - a visit to the building is
strongly recommended to identify potential test antenna locations.
On the day of the measurements, these antenna locations should be maintained within
a minimum error margin, which is established according to campaign accuracy require­
ments. Also, test antenna heights and types of antennas to be used must also be selected
here.
For the example shown here, note that ﬁve antennas have been selected to be used in
this building, as depicted in Figure 7.16. The ﬁrst antenna, a directional one, has been
located there to illuminate the corridor and to gather information about wall losses from
different materials. Antenna 2 has been placed at the entrance of the building to
illuminate the lobby area. It will be used to determine leakage levels outside the building
and assess the backlobe performance of this directional antenna. Omni antennas 3 and 4

238
Indoor Wireless Communications
have been placed at the areas shown in the ﬁgure to provide coverage in open spaces,
with no partitions, as well as to gather wall penetration in cubicles and to determine
leakage levels. Finally, antenna 5, also directional, provides coverage in the warehouse,
assesses diffraction through windows to contiguous rooms and also gathers information
about other wall materials.
7.6.1.5
Walk Test Routes
For walk test routes, to have a plan is essential, especially for saving valuable time when
conducting the measurements. The areas to measure must be clearly identiﬁed, even if
the very speciﬁc paths are not exactly marked - it is often sufﬁcient to indicate the rooms
and types of walk routes to be followed (straight lines, zigzag, circles, etc.).
It is important at this stage to emphasize that it is not critical to walk in all the building.
The most representative rooms and spaces, such as corridors and atriums, have to be
selected. Also, bear in mind that, whenever possible, to obtain ﬂoor penetration loss
information, walk at least a ﬂoor above and/or below the tested antenna.
Finally, the extent of the walk should include all areas until the received signal strength
has reached the noise ﬂoor and should not be too close to the tested antenna so as to
saturate the receiver.
7.6.1.6
Workplan
The workplan deals with the timing of the MCP: what needs to be done and when. A
workplan is very useful in planning activities, resources and times, and is usually
performed using a Gantt chart. Here, task dependencies can easily be identiﬁed as
well as milestones, and adjustments can be made if a task is at risk of delaying the whole
measurement campaign. A priority here is to ﬁnish the measurement campaign on time
and within budget!
7.6.1.7
Implications of Not Having an MCP
The implications of not having a measurement campaign plan or having an incomplete
version include:
 Delays in conducting the measurements. Sometimes this can make the difference
between ﬁnishing on time or leaving some areas untested, which may result in
additional expenses as a second visit may be required.
 Impossibility to conduct some or all measurements. If permission was not granted, or
not properly negotiated, or a piece of testing equipment was not planned and included
in the checklist, it may be the case that the measurement campaign would need to be
cancelled.
 Erroneous measured data. Failure to carefully design the type of data that needs to be
gathered, or the channels to be tested, or the walk routes that need to be performed, or
the receiving equipment setup may result in collecting data that is wrong or contains
errors that cannot be ﬁxed during postprocessing.
7.6.2
Choose a Suitable Navigation System
As signal strength samples are recorded, they need to be linked to spatial coordinates and
time stamps in order to establish a spatiotemporal frame for measurements. Propagation

239
7 Radio MeasurementsFigure depicting the example of an available floorplan for in-building data collection.
Figure 7.17 Example of an available ﬂoorplan for in-building data collection.
models are distance-dependent, as path loss varies with distance, and temporal varia­
tions are also to be recorded. Spatial variations are extremely important since they
determine to a great extent the cell dimensioning as well since three dimensions are
required for in-building work - unlike for most outdoor projects, where horizontal
distances are much greater than heights.
There is a major limitation in navigation and positioning for indoor scenarios as it is a
fact that the signal from the GPS (global positioning system), which is greatly used for
drive tests and outdoor measurements, cannot penetrate buildings. Thus, alternative
methods for in-building navigation and positioning should be examined, one of which is
described next.
The most common approach to navigation indoors is called way-point navigation.
This method has been widely used in many commercial in-building collection tools
developed by several radio data collection software and hardware manufacturers.
The approach consists of having a digital representation of parts of the building in
consideration, which may be split by ﬂoors or regions. This representation is typically a
bitmap image showing the ﬂoor layout, as shown in Figure 7.17, but some collection
tools are capable of navigating using CAD formats, which provide vector representations
of walls and other building features. The user interacts with the data collection software
using a 'pen' input device on the touch-screen of the collection computer. This input
selects their position at a given point in time on the ﬂoor layout displayed on the
collection system's graphical user interface. The user's entry of their start position begins
recording regular samples from the RF receiver hardware and data collection continues
as the user walks in a straight line to a new position within the building and then stops.
The user then indicates this end-point to the collection software on the ﬂoor layout using
the touch-screen.
The collection software then uniformly assigns a position to each discrete sample
collected over the period between the start time and end time of the walk segment the
user has just completed, assuming the user has walked at a constant speed. This process
is repeated segment by segment, as the user moves around the building, until all required

areas of the building have been surveyed. This is the approach used in the example
shown in Figure 7.18; note that the route is composed of straight-line segments due to
the way-point approach. A skilled user can achieve accuracies of the order of 1m from
way-point navigation.
This way-point approach has various disadvantages. The use of high-resolution maps
is normally required, since the user must determine his position with reasonable
accuracy. This may not often be available, especially for large facilities with a complicated
building layout. Also, in cases where a measurement route should be repeated, way-point
navigation can provide neither the repeatability nor the accuracy required. Nevertheless,
way-point navigation is very simple to implement and is sufﬁciently accurate for most
common applications (Aragón-Zavala, 2003).
Both antenna locations and walk routes need to be sufﬁciently accurate. Note that
repeating the same walk route will give different results, even when conducted carefully,
as depicted in Figure 7.19, and this contributes to the 'in-built' uncertainty of the whole
measurement/prediction/veriﬁcation process.
When this positioning accuracy is required, other indoor positioning and navigation
systems have been employed and suggested using mobile robots with a 'ﬁfth wheel'
mechanism, which samples at equally spaced intervals (Aragón-Zavala and Saunders,
1999; Radi et al., 1998). This conﬁguration is often desired:
 When measurements are to be isolated from the human body.
 If repeatability is required; for example when time variations in the channel are
analysed and different runs over exactly the same route are to be performed.
 In hazardous environments for the ﬁeld engineer; for example exposure to high levels
of radiation.

241
7 Radio Measurements
Figure 7.19 Impact of positioning.
 If high accuracy in position is necessary at the expense of a longer time to conduct the
measurements, with requirements for absolute position updates and limitations on the
surface on which the robot can navigate.
 Whenever autonomous navigation is needed, providing an accurate and inexpensive
method of navigation for indoors.
Figure 7.20 shows two of the mobile robot platforms employed for these special
measurement campaigns. One follows a route marked out on the ﬂoor with a high degree
of accuracy, while the other is pushed by the user and uses odometry and gyroscopes to
determine its position. It becomes a very interesting project for students to build a
specialized robot responsible for the navigation and positioning of the radio transmitters
or receivers within a measurement campaign - this certainly provides students with a
broader picture of practical applications of robotics in the wireless industry!
7.6.3
Signal Sampling and Averaging Considerations
While the requirements of the measurement system will depend in detail on the speciﬁc
application for the measurements, there are some generic issues related to the way in
which mobile signals must be sampled, which are common to all applications.
In modern receiver systems, signals are recorded by digital sampling, producing a
series of discrete samples rather than a continuous signal record. The available sample
rate is typically limited by the speed of the associated analogue-to-digital converters, the
available storage space and, in the case of scanning multiple channels, the retuning rate
of the receiver. It is then important to determine a sample rate that represents the signal
sufﬁciently accurately for the application in hand.
For path loss modelling, the interest is mainly in determining the local mean of the
signal, removing the fast fading component while providing a high-conﬁdence estimate
of the underlying power associated with the overall path loss and shadowing processes.
This implies that all of the samples gathered must be taken within a time period over

242
Indoor Wireless Communications
Photog raph Mdepic ting m obile ro bot s empl oyed fo r indoor channel measurements.
which the mobile receiver is well within the shadowing correlation distance (the distance
taken for the normalized autocorrelation to fall to 0.37); otherwise the local mean will
not represent the shadowing variations adequately, which loses the detail of the system
coverage that the test is aimed at revealing. There must also be enough samples so that
the receiver noise ﬂoor does not excessively affect the estimate. On the other hand, it is
important that the samples taken are not so closely gathered that they have a high
probability of being in a fading null, or peak, which will produce a signiﬁcant over- or
underestimation of the local mean. In this application only the signal amplitude is of
direct relevance, although sampling of both in-phase and quadrature components
simultaneously will effectively produce twice as many independent samples of noise
and of fast fading within the same distance.
The local mean is an average of the received signal strength, often used for path loss
modelling. For this, we are not interested in the exact rapid variations of the mobile
signal - this is handled statistically, as the nature of mobile radio signals is random. The
description of these fading characteristics is beyond the scope of this book. For further
details, refer to Saunders and Aragón-Zavala (2007).
The example plots shown in Figure 7.21 illustrate the effects of undersampling and
oversampling a signal when the local mean is to be obtained. The message here is that the
signal must be sampled at the right sampling rate - much quicker sampling rates will
overload the receiver's memory and fast fading (very rapid signal variations) will also be
captured and must be removed. If not enough samples are taken, shadowing (slow

7 Radio Measurements

fading) characteristics will be lost and therefore there is a high risk of not producing an
accurate enough model.
While oversampling is normally not considered to be a serious issue affecting the
measurements, since the excess of samples and consequently the fast fading can be
removed by applying suitable averaging methods, undersampling can be a problem, as
there is no way to get shadowing effects if enough samples were not taken. For the latter,
a revisit to the site needs to be done and more measurements at a higher sampling rate
would be required.
For estimating the local mean signal power for path loss modelling, there are various
estimators that can be used, as follows:
 Median, which consists of taking the 50% value of all the data set within the interval of
interest.
 Decibel mean, where averaging is performed in decibels directly. For example, two
samples
at
	85 dBm
and
	93 dBm
would
be
averaged
in
dB
as
simply:
	85  93=2  	89 dBm.
 Linear voltage mean, which involves performing the average in volts.
 Linear power mean, where the averaging is performed in watts. For example, for the
previous samples, to perform the average, both values must ﬁrst be converted to watts:
	85 dBm is 3.162 pW whereas 	93 dBm is 0.501 pW. Thus, the average in watts is:
3:162  0:501=2  1:8315 pW. If we convert this ﬁgure back to dBm we have
	87:4 dBm.
 Optimal estimator, which uses a weighted average of samples. This is slightly more
complex than the previous estimators but seems to yield the highest accuracy.
Figure 7.22 shows a comparison of these methods to estimate the local mean, which
shows how the error on either side of the mean for each estimator varies with the number
of samples used for 90% conﬁdence. It should be recalled that all of these values assume
Rayleigh fading statistics and it is assumed that all samples experience statistically
independent fading. Further details of the above-mentioned averaging methods can be
found in Saunders and Aragón-Zavala (2007).
Table 7.2 shows the minimum electrical distance for each of the estimator types. In
some cases this electrical distance may be typically some tens of metres for outdoor
environments. In such cases, which are most likely to occur at lower frequencies,
selection of a good estimator is important to avoid averaging the detail of the shadowing
information. For in-building environments, where the shadowing correlation distance is
of the order of a few metres, it may be impossible to meet this criterion and a

compromise between averaging fast fading and not disturbing shadowing must be
reached. One approach is to average all the samples in a small area rather than along a
line, thus deﬁning what is known as a bin.
Another approach to determining appropriate sample rates for channel sampling is to
consider the ﬁrst Nyquist criterion. It can simply be stated as follows: for a band-limited
signal waveform to be reproduced accurately, each cycle of the input signal must be
sampled at least twice. In the context of a narrowband fading signal, this implies that at
least two samples per wavelength are required. Under such conditions, an interpolation
procedure can be applied to calculate the values of the original, continuous signal with
any degree of accuracy.

For accurate results, this maximum speed should not be exceeded. For in-building work,
this is rarely an issue; however, for outdoor data collection this has to be taken into
account by limiting the driving speed.
To assess how important it is to consider the appropriate data averaging window on
model tuning accuracy, Figure 7.23 shows three examples of the same collected data
but averaged in a different way. Notice how if proper sampling has been done, fast
fading is removed without eliminating shadowing variability (given by σ). The power
law model, shown as a red line, is the same for all ﬁgures as the best ﬁt is based on the
average path loss.

Documentation
It is essential to document the survey in a form that will allow the measurements to be
used at a much later date, perhaps years later, with all important parameters and
conditions recorded. A survey completion form is typically designed for the measure­
ment campaign to facilitate this. It should typically include:
 Site details, contact names and access arrangements. This is usually handy for future
surveys, which may need to be conducted at the same site.
 The type of survey being conducted.
 Details of which ﬂoors are to be surveyed and the corresponding data ﬁlenames.
 The purpose of the survey; for example propagation model calibration, existing
coverage, design survey, etc.

246
Indoor Wireless Communications
 The building description; for example corporate ofﬁce building, airport, railway
station, etc.
 The on-site dates and time of surveys along with which ﬂoor they were on and the
names of the associated data ﬁles and photographs should be completed.
 A complete list of the serial numbers of the measurement equipment should be
completed.
 The form should be signed and dated by the radio ﬁeld engineer.
 The survey completion form should be scanned and stored with the project data.
Bear in mind that, as for any other project in engineering, the habit of documentation is
essential; especially for radio measurements that you conduct on a site that you are just
visiting for a few hours, this becomes even more important. Suppose you are doing
measurements in an airport hundreds of kilometres away from your company premises; if
you did not document all in detail, how do you expect to obtain speciﬁc details of antenna
positions, heights, building characteristics, etc.? You will need to go back! This is not too
bad ifitisjust a matteroftravellingbacktothesite,butwhatifyou wereonly grantedaccess
for that day? You might need to wait weeks and in some cases months to go back!
7.6.5
Walk Test Best Practice
In order to properly characterize a building, the walk routes should be carefully selected.
The following guidelines may help:
 The walk route should include both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight situations.
 Data should be collected over paths that include penetration through multiple walls of
various construction types and also through ﬂoors above and below the test antenna
location.
 The walk should cover the area of interest fairly evenly, walking all the way across
rooms where practical, rather than only close to the edges.
 The walk should be in straight lines given the way-point navigation and multiple
routes should be conducted in large open areas, typically with around 10-20m
between routes in a grid or zigzag pattern.
 Walk through as many doorways as possible; that is if a room has two different
entrances, walk through each door at least once
 Walk smoothly at a constant pace to minimize the navigation error.
 If it is desired to directly compare multiple instances of the same route, then consider
placing markers on the ﬂoor to act as an accurate reminder of the way-points used.
 Survey antennas should be low-gain omnidirectional antennas to illuminate the whole
environment, unless a speciﬁc directional antenna characteristic is of interest.
 An outdoor measurement route should usually be conducted to determine signal
leakage from the building.
 Survey for different types of environment (e.g. cluttered, open, densely populated,
etc.).
There are occasions in which, although a predeﬁned route has been chosen, during the
day of the measurements it is not possible to have access to a speciﬁc area in the building
and therefore the route plan needs to be adjusted accordingly. For example, suppose you
are doing radio testing in an international airport and it turns out that during the day you

had been granted access, an airline VIP lounge is closed and there is no way to measure
there. The radio engineer should be capable of making decisions quickly and on-the­
move should any circumstance similar to this occur. A viable alternative would be to
choose a contiguous room or space where a similar environment exists and therefore
measurements in this area could be of great value.
See in the example of Figure 7.24 how walk test routes have been selected for the same
ﬂoor and for through-ﬂoor propagation. Walk routes have been included in many
contiguous rooms to indicate repeatability and to have more samples when character­
izing wall losses. An atrium in the ground ﬂoor (indicated below) shows how the walk
route included an atrium. A walk along a long corridor has also been included. Finally,
for through-ﬂoor propagation, by having an omnidirectional antenna in the middle ﬂoor
two walk routes have been included in the ﬂoors above and below.
The use of insufﬁcient or inappropriate walk test routes may bring as a consequence
errors in the model tuning, leading to signal prediction errors. This is shown in
Figure 7.25 where an 'only far' route and an 'only close' route have been selected.
Note how signal prediction can signiﬁcantly change depending on which of the routes is
chosen, if the model is to be tuned using these measurements. The best approach here is,
if possible, to select walk routes that are representative for the different environments in
the building in order to gather valuable propagation information. This is sometimes not
possible as access may not be granted to all desired test locations, but at least awareness
of the consequences of not testing there needs to be made.
7.6.6
Equipment Calibration and Validation
Equipment calibration and system validation are essential ingredients for any in-building
measurement campaign, which should not be overlooked, and a fair amount of time and
resources must be dedicated to both if accurate measurements are to be produced.

248
Indoor Wireless CommunicationsFigure depicting effects of an inappropriate walk route selection.
Figure 7.25 Effects of an inappropriate walk route selection.
Equipment calibration is a procedure that aims to suppress the impact of measure­
ment inaccuracies due to several factors that may affect operating speciﬁcations of
equipment. Calibration is very important for any accurate propagation work, and if not
performed periodically and prior to measurements, errors cannot be measured or
accounted for, leading to totally incorrect results. Calibration is a periodic procedure
that is typically done at least every 12 months, and could be more frequent depending on
the type of equipment that is to be calibrated.
On the other hand, equipment is validated by an accuracy assessment of the system
integration operation; this means that all the equipment is validated when intercon­
nected to other elements within the measurement system. Validation is the process of
ensuring that the complete measurement system, from transmitter via cables and
antennas to the receiver, and the data logging system deliver reliable and accurate
results. It is typically done at least every 3-6 months depending on how often the
equipment is used, or before very important measurement campaigns.
Amongst the most important issues related to calibration/validation of radio equip­
ment, we can mention:
 Transmitters (output power, frequency, power supply, operation in long periods of
time)
 Receivers (signal injection, dynamic range, frequency, fading)
 Passive elements (cable loss, antenna pattern, attenuators, connectors, splitters, etc.).
This means that special care must be taken with these issues and calibration and
validation routines must include these elements. This applies to both outdoor and
indoor measurement campaigns.
Calibration is an essential procedure to be performed for every measuring equipment
since all of the propagation model accuracy evaluation and tuning processes depend on a

249
7 Radio Measurements
good set of measurements, which otherwise would not be possible to get without the use
of carefully calibrated equipment. There is no point in having a good model if the
measurements used to evaluate or calibrate it are ﬂawed - its parameters will be wrong
anyway!
One of the risks in using a logarithmic scale is that belief of 'only a few decibels' will not
have any impact on the accuracy of the work. Just to give an example, 1 dB offset in
measurement equipment can mean 12% more or less antennas in a design - and you will
never know which it is, more or less!
Calibration aims at ensuring that individual equipment is working within speciﬁca­
tions given by the manufacturer. For example, if an 11 dBm output transmitter is used
for CW testing, it is expected that the transmitter outputs 11 dBm within a tolerance of
0.1% (assuming this is the speciﬁcation given by the manufacturer). If the equipment
has not been calibrated, the transmitter may transmit 10 dBm (even if the display in the
transmitter indicates 11 dBm). This 1 dB of error will be carried to the actual
measurements and affect the results greatly, and the worst effect is that engineers
will not notice it! Likewise, if the transmitter indicates a carrier frequency of 913.8 MHz
and it has not been calibrated, it might be the case that it actually transmits a carrier at
913.45 MHz, well out of the expected frequency and of the tolerance limits given by the
manufacturer.
For an in-building system integrator, these speciﬁcations will usually exceed the
manufacturer's ones, making sure the equipment is not 'pushed to operate in the limits'.
The main issue with validation is to ensure that signal strength is accurately reported,
both given a transmit power setting and a receiver reading. To conﬁrm this, very well
calibrated power meters are needed for the transmitter, and a calibrated signal source
(typically a signal generator) for the receiver is also employed. The sources need to be
calibrated to a higher accuracy than is required from your measurement equipment.
On the other hand, frequency accuracy is also validated, within a predeﬁned range
according to speciﬁcations, since frequency drift may be present under certain atmo­
spheric conditions (an increase in the temperature, for example).
Since measurement campaigns tend to last from a few minutes to several hours,
stability over time is also of interest to be validated. Typically, transmitters change their
power signiﬁcantly in the ﬁrst 10-30 minutes after switch-on. This needs to be
characterized and taken into consideration. A common practice is to switch the
transmitter on and leave it for at least an hour for its output power to stabilize.
Finally, reﬂections from passive components characterized by the VSWR need to be
validated, to estimate the amount of power that is being reﬂected. This applies for
antennas, feeders, connectors, etc.
There are some components that cannot be validated. For example, antennas and
moving parts of the system are not included in the validation exercise. Dynamic issues
like sampling rates and averaging are also not possible to be validated, and even
sometimes the entire system chain (transmitter and receiver) cannot be validated in
one go. For these cases, and to overcome the limitations of not validating the system
while ensuring we minimize measurement errors and uncertainties, set the equipment
up exactly as used in practice, including all software options and equipment setting, in a
clear open environment; for example big car parks with no cars can work well. Next,
repeatedly walk a simple well-characterized route and derive the appropriate offsets and
adjustments required.

7.7 Model Tuning and Validation
Indoor propagation model tuning consists of adjusting model parameters that depend on
speciﬁc characteristics (materials, partitions, clutter, etc.) to account for building or site
details that otherwise could not be modelled. This process is performed using radio
measurements on the areas and places of interest, obtaining through the use of these
measurements valuable information related to the site. Bear in mind that although this is
necessary in the process, measurements are not always available or it can be impractical
to perform an excessive amount of them, for which radio designers should have a very
clear picture of how many measurements are required.
Tuning empirical path loss models is usually the starting point for the rollout of any
network. For example, to ﬁnd the parameters n and K in the power law models described
in Chapter 5, measurements can be conducted and, after applying linear regression to
these, the values for the path loss intercept and path loss exponent can be found for a
speciﬁc building or site.
By carefully using radio measurements to tune propagation models, we can reduce the
number of measurements needed to design a site and hence produce a higher precision
result than 'default' modelling alone - it is difﬁcult to generalize unique parameters that
could apply to a model without tuning the model with measurements. Thus, the result is
an optimum trade-off between the beneﬁts and costs of both approaches, saving time
and money in the design and implementation.
On the other hand, model validation is the process to validate signal strength
predictions made using propagation models against measurements. This is often
performed after the system has been designed and base stations have been deployed
around the site, to verify that signal levels and coverage targets are met. It is important
to emphasize that different sets of measurements should be used for tuning and
validation.
In summary, the model and validation process consists on the following aspects:
 Import measurements to be used for tuning and validation.
 Trace adjustments.
 Select appropriate measurements for tuning, since erroneous data can yield incorrect
predictions.
 Some measurements are reserved for testing the accuracy of the tuned model, since it
is not correct to use the same measurements for tuning and validation.
 Manual tuning of the wall materials, as they strongly impact the propagation
mechanisms involved.
 Manual tuning of the ﬂoor materials, for through-ﬂoor predictions.
 Perform tuning of model parameters.
 Examine the tuned coefﬁcients.
 Validate model accuracy with the test measurements; that is the data set reserved for
validation only.
So far, the pros and cons of modelling versus measurements in the design process have
been examined and all the beneﬁts that propagation models bring to an in-building
design have been highlighted. It is clear that although propagation models can yield more
accurate predictions, if erroneous data are used to 'tune' the model parameters,
signiﬁcant errors can also be produced in the predictions.

By carefully using radio measurements to tune propagation models we can reduce the
number of measurements needed to design a building, and hence produce a higher
precision result than 'default' modelling alone - it is difﬁcult to generalize unique
parameters that could apply to a model without tuning the model with measurements.
Thus, the result is an optimum trade-off between the beneﬁts and costs of both
approaches, saving time and money in the design and implementation.
7.7.1
Measurements for Model Tuning
There is no need to walk absolutely everywhere in the building; this would take an
enormous amount of time and resources and would not necessarily bring more beneﬁts
to the predictions. However, sufﬁcient measurements need to be collected in order to
tune the model accurately. Note that a separate set of measurements is required for
model tuning and for model validation (Aragón-Zavala et al., 2006). The same data set
cannot be used for both, as biased results would then be obtained, leading to an 'almost
perfect' propagation model tested against the areas for which the same measurements
were used for tuning.
The question here is: how much is enough? Some guidelines would be:
 Represent as many environments (materials, partitions, etc.) as possible within the
building.
 Extract valuable information from challenging environments such as atriums and
corridors - model tuning will need these data to represent these effects more accurately.
 Gather data to model wall and ﬂoor loss factors.
 Sampling rate should be adequate to represent local mean statistics (if only this is
required).
Once the measurements have been imported from the collection tool, it is very
important to perform a measurement data check to make sure the levels that are
visualized are congruent and seem correct. Depending on the postprocessing and design
software, different approaches can be followed. If using the iBwave design (iBwave
Solutions Inc., 2016), this can be normally performed visually using a colour palette
indicating signal strength values and the walk route, as depicted in Figure 7.26. If
erroneous samples are detected in a large area, measurements should be repeated there.
For empirical model tuning, detailed measurements are made of the path loss for sites
in a range of environments. This is particularly important for in-building design due to
the large variability of building environments and materials. Then models of the
propagation path loss are ﬁtted to these measurements for later applications within
radio planning tools.
Figure 7.26 shows a scatter plot of measured data with best-ﬁt approximations for a
power law model and for a free-space loss model. The spread about the mean value in the
plot, also known as shadowing, as seen in Chapter 4, is due to the non-distant-dependent
losses, such as:
 Transmission loss from walls
 Reﬂections
 Diffractions from corners
 Variabilities in the measurement process.

7.7.2
Factors Affecting Model Tuning
There are many factors that can affect model tuning performance, which are described as
follows:
 Propagation mechanisms, which may affect especially the areas that could not be
surveyed and therefore make the model underestimate or overestimate path loss in
these zones.
 Antenna locations, as their choice has a deep impact on the amount of useful
information that can be extracted to calibrate the model (wall/ﬂoor factors, building
materials, etc.).
 Extent of surveyed data, as when insufﬁcient locations were collected, there is not
sufﬁcient information to gather all the relevant parameters of the model.
 Averaging, for oversampled data, as when not done correctly, can 'smooth' the data in
excess or leave fast fading still present.
 System calibration, as when uncalibrated equipment was used to collect the measure­
ments, it is impossible to determine measurement errors and inaccuracies and to
quantify them.
7.7.3
Impact of Having Insufﬁcient Measurements for Tuning
To assess the impact of having an insufﬁcient number of measurement samples in model
tuning, Figure 7.27 shows various examples of outcomes having a different number of
measurements. The ﬁgures correspond to:
 All survey data used for tuning are included.
 Only one measurement route is included (21% of the total survey data).

253
7 Radio MeasurementsFigure depicting examples of measurements used for model tuning.
Figure 7.27 Examples of measurements used for model tuning.
 All survey data used for tuning close to the transmitter are included.
 All survey data used for tuning far from the transmitter are included.
All survey data used for tuning are included. Noise-ﬂoor (minimum signal level that
can be received) was assumed at 87.5 dB. Noise-ﬂoor was not reached in any of the survey
data. However, this ﬁgure shows how the scatter plot would look if the noise-ﬂoor were
reached at 87.5 dB. To produce this ﬁgure all points with a greater path loss were
manually moved to the noise-ﬂoor path loss, at 87.5 dB.
The effects of insufﬁcient measurements for model tuning also can be seen by a visual
inspection of the predicted signal strength plots. The upper plot in Figure 7.28 shows a
prediction with a sufﬁcient number of measurements; we see all the areas with
reasonable values of signal strength. Now let us examine the plot below with an
insufﬁcient number of measurements. Refer back to the scatter plots in Figure 7.27.
Clearly the NLOS exponent in this case is much higher and therefore a very low signal
strength is measured on these locations - as expected since there was no way to
determine a more approximate value for such an exponent.
If measurements are taken only close to the tested antenna and not far away, the path
loss exponent obtained is rather optimistic and does not account for additional wall
losses for far away locations; therefore, the predictions obtained overestimate the signal
strength values that would have been obtained having sufﬁcient samples also far away
from the antenna. Refer to the scatter plots in Figure 7.27.
On the other hand, if measurements are taken only far from the tested antenna and not
close to it, the propagation prediction far from the tested antenna in some areas is similar
to the prediction if survey data were available close and far from the antenna. However,
note that the prediction differs in other areas far from the tested antenna. The
propagation far from the tested antenna is dependent on the signal strength in areas

254

close to the transmitter antenna. Therefore, for an accurate prediction we need to tune
the propagation model with survey data from both close and far from the tested antenna.
The noise-ﬂoor is another important aspect to take into account when performing
model tuning. Sometimes, measurements are collected at far distances from the transmit
antenna that have reached the receiver noise-ﬂoor. These samples therefore are of no use
as they do not represent real values, as seen in the last plot shown in Figure 7.27.
7.8 Conclusion
Radio measurements are an essential ingredient of the overall in-building design process.
It is rather difﬁcult to visualize their importance if the beneﬁts and need for measure­
ments have not been analysed in depth. A clear understanding of the value of
measurements for in-building design projects has been developed through the review
of the different types of in-building measurement systems and their characteristics,
appreciation of the impact of inaccuracies while performing measurements and the
various guidelines and recommendations for in-building testing, which will assist the in-
building radio engineer in his or her design.
During this chapter, the basics of propagation measurements and their classiﬁcation,
according to their characteristics and the type of equipment utilized for these, have been
presented. There are important issues to take into consideration, such as measurement
inaccuracies, sampling and navigation, that were reviewed to make sure they are
accounted for when planning and conducting a measurement campaign. A brief over­
view of equipment for in-building measurements was also given, discussing some
technical details of relevant components and equipment, such as transmitters, receivers,
feeders and antennas. The role of having a well-documented measurement campaign
was also discussed, especially when postanalysis of the collected data is to be performed:
there is a need to have a good reference. Finally, tips and tricks for effective measure­
ments were presented, along with some walk route guidelines and recommendations.

255
7 Radio Measurements
There is a very relevant issue not to be overlooked here, and it corresponds to
calibration. For most cases, the measurements reported by the equipment out of the box
will not be correct and some offsets will need to be applied, no matter what speciﬁcations
are required from manufacturers. This happens not because the equipment is faulty but
due to some of the many variables affecting the measurements, which lead to uncer­
tainties difﬁcult to predict and measure. Thus, simple 'correction factors' can apply to
any given measurement system at a given frequency and conﬁguration. There is then
some important organizational work to ensure that these values are carefully recorded
and applied, and that values for all given equipment can be tracked over time.
Prior to any propagation measurement campaign, make sure all transmit and receive
equipment chains have been validated and that individual key devices have been
calibrated. Although calibration and validation certainly take time, they can save
time afterwards and deﬁnitely will guarantee that the measured data are as accurate
as possible.

Capacity Planning and Dimensioning
Capacity determines to a great extent the service availability and hence impacts on the
quality-of-service of a radio network. For example, to be able to establish a call or a
successful data connection anytime, anywhere in a building, from a user's point of view,
is a subjective measure of network quality. Nowadays with the increasing growth of data
trafﬁc, this necessity can be aggravated if users are not able to establish reliable
connections at the speed they require, thus affecting a user's experience. Both situations
are deﬁnitely reﬂected in an operator's revenue, as more satisﬁed customers will attract
more users and, likewise, poor quality-of-service, measured as blocked calls, does not
encourage customers to continue utilizing the network.
The calculation of the number of channels needed to cater for the capacity require­
ments of the users in a speciﬁc building is to be reviewed here, once the number of users
and type of users is determined, as well as the trafﬁc proﬁle that is expected. This
approach has also to account for possible system expansions and expected growth in the
number of users or subscribers over time. There are special considerations that need to
be made for indoor systems and that differ from those used in outdoor networks, in
particular for those challenging venues having a large number of users for peak time
periods (stadiums, airports, etc.). These will be emphasized in this chapter.
In general, every indoor wireless technology has its own characteristics and
approaches to plan for capacity. This chapter aims at giving an overview for capacity
dimensioning for voice and data trafﬁc and planning for any indoor wireless technology.
8.1
Introduction
For indoor scenarios where hotspots of population are expected, capacity dimensioning
plays an essential role in network performance. For voice, as a limited number of
channels are available for use within the cell, if the system is not properly dimensioned,
additional users to those that can be served will not be allowed to connect to the network
or will be blocked. Moreover, for UMTS networks, if capacity is incorrectly estimated,
more "unexpected" users will generate more interference to that accounted in the link
budget and hence reduce the cell radius signiﬁcantly, as the noise rise will increase in the
uplink. On the other hand, for the downlink, if more users are served than those
dimensioned for, the cell radius will also be reduced as more power is needed to be
distributed amongst a higher population. For LTE networks, which have much more
intensive use of data trafﬁc, capacity requires a careful dimensioning and proper data

ofﬂoading to alleviate excessive peaks that, for example, a cellular network may not be
able to cope with.
Capacity is also a very important performance parameter for Wi-Fi networks. Here,
the number of users has a great impact on network throughput, due to the protocol that
Wi-Fi devices use to send packets over the air interface: sense the channel for activity,
then transmit if the channel is free, wait for acknowledgement and retransmit after a
certain time if no acknowledgement is received. Obviously, the more users are in the
network, the more likely that collisions may occur and hence even though the data rate
can be apparently fast, the actual throughput is greatly reduced.
The layout of the building has also a signiﬁcant effect on the way capacity is planned.
Walls and partitions may help indoor zones to be created for which a proportional
number of resources can be allocated according to trafﬁc demands. A different approach
clearly needs to be taken when planning capacity for a corporate ofﬁce building, an
airport or a stadium. However, one common consideration that is taken is where the
hotspots of trafﬁc are located. Although this is a term often employed in Wi-Fi networks,
the same principle holds for other wireless systems.
There is a relevant consideration to be made depending on the type of services offered
to the customer when designing for capacity. Voice trafﬁc is considered a real-time
service, that is to be delivered with the minimum possible delay. The quality of service is
greatly affected not only if the voice call is rejected to enter the network but also if the
signal is greatly delayed - little tolerance is allowed. On the other hand, data trafﬁc
normally is not affected if data are delayed; for example you do not really care too much if
an email arrives a few seconds or even minutes late. Thus, different methods need to be
employed depending on the type of trafﬁc considered - trafﬁc categories and some
characteristics are further explained in Section 8.3.5.
Therefore, when designing an indoor network, an accurate knowledge of the required
number of channels can prevent the system from having high blocking and additional
unexpected noise rise, as well as the propagation characteristics of the building, all as an
integrated approach. The methods involved in determining the necessary number of
channels in accordance with the building population and the distribution of these users
within the building are deﬁned as capacity planning.
Bear in mind that, in the past, estimation of spectrum requirements were considered
as a framework focusing on a single system and market scenario, something that
nowadays is no longer applicable (ITU, 2013). New models have to be used that allow
for consideration of spatial and temporal correlations among telecommunication
services, taking into consideration the market requirements and network deployment
scenarios. This has been mainly motivated by the convergence of mobile and ﬁxed
telecommunication and multinetwork environments as well as the support of attributed
systems such as seamless interworking between different complementary access
systems.
8.2 An Overview On Teletrafﬁc
Teletrafﬁc is the application of trafﬁc engineering theory to telecommunications, using
the basic knowledge of probability and statistics including queuing theory, the nature of
trafﬁc, practical models, measurements and simulations to make predictions and to

assist in the planning of telecommunication networks. This applies to both wired and
wireless networks.
The ﬁeld of teletrafﬁc was created after the work of a Danish statistician, Agner Krarup
Erlang, shown in Figure 8.1, in the beginning of the twentiethcentury. Erlang published
his work "The Theory of Probabilities and Telephone Conversations" in 1909, where he
was able to calculate how many lines were required to service a speciﬁc number of users,
given a certain availability of the lines for the users.
Erlang's work and teletrafﬁc was originally developed to be used in circuit-switched
networks, but in recent times it has also been extended to packet-switched networks.
Although teletrafﬁc is applied for both, the theory has evolved to account for the
particularities of broadband networks, where voice is not the only service to be offered,
but many other services and connections need to be available. Alternative trafﬁc models
for broadband in addition to those proposed by Erlang had therefore to be proposed,
which include parameters such as mean demand and trafﬁc variability. These models
are out of the scope of this book. For a more detailed study on teletrafﬁc, refer to
Schwartz (1987).
8.2.1
Trunking
In modern communications, and speciﬁcally in telephony, trunking is a concept by which
a communications system can provide network access to many users by sharing a set of
channels (or lines) instead of providing them individually, on a dedicated basis. In
addition to cellular, this concept also applies to private mobile radio systems (PMRs), in
which many users have access to a limited number of channel resources. This is the key
of the success of many telecommunication systems, such as cellular and PMR, since only
a limited number of channels are required to service an area (e.g. a cell) on the
assumption that the probability of all users utilizing the network at the same time is
low. In fact, networks are dimensioned to account for some of those users to be rejected
or blocked, as will be explained later.
Those wireless communication systems that make use of trunking are also called
trunked radio systems (TRSs). These systems provide greater efﬁciency than conven­
tional radio systems, at the expense of greater management overhead. TRSs pool all the
channels into one group and use a site controller that assigns incoming users to free
channels as determined by the TRS protocols. Depending on the speciﬁc wireless
technology, these entities (site controller, channels, etc.) may have different names and
functions.

260
Indoor Wireless Communications
8.2.2
Loss and Queue Networks
There are two ways in which trafﬁc can be handled in a network, depending on how
incoming users are handled when all channels are busy:
Loss systems, where calls that cannot be handled are given an equipment 'busy tone' and
are rejected. For example, in cellular systems, there are occasions where the mobile
phone indicates a full coverage level and there is sufﬁcient signal strength but when a
user attempts to make a phone call, a 'busy tone' is heard. Loss systems are normally
those used for voice trafﬁc.
Queue systems, where calls that cannot be handled immediately are queued and delays
are speciﬁed, after which the call is rejected if no available channels are in place. Data
trafﬁc can be handled in queue systems.
8.2.3
Busy-Hour
Capacity dimensioning for wireless networks, and in particular for cellular systems, is
performed during the times of the day where most trafﬁc is likely to occur. In a
communications system, the busy-hour is then referred to as the sliding sixty-minute
period during which the maximum total trafﬁc load occurs in a given 24-hour period.
It is expected that the 'peak' in trafﬁc occurs during the busy-hour and therefore
sufﬁcient channels should be allocated for this purpose to guarantee a given QoS.
For highly-populated environments such as airports, to account for capacity dimen­
sioning, the busy-hour is chosen according to airport daily activity as well as season of the
year. Summer is normally a very busy season and thus planning should be done for busy-
hour trafﬁc during this period. There are other environments that exhibit a more
uniform behaviour, such as corporate buildings, for which trafﬁc is expected to be fairly
regular throughout the year. Shopping centres, on the other hand, have Christmas and
special seasonal dates as the busiest times of the year.
There are other wireless systems that exhibit a similar 'busy-hour' kind of behaviour
and for which special capacity considerations should be made. For example, Wi-Fi
systems in a university campus are busier during term times and become more congested
in speciﬁc periods of time, such as exams. Regardless of the system in consideration, the
same design principles apply, and should be employed to account for sufﬁcient radio
resources.
8.3 Capacity Parameters - Circuit-Switched
In the design of a circuit-switched network for capacity there are various parameters that
should be used, which are described in this section. Note that these parameters apply for
voice trafﬁc only and cannot be used for data trafﬁc.
8.3.1
Blocking
As we have discussed earlier, for trunked systems capacity is determined by a ﬁnite
number of channels available for all users within a building on the basis that not all users

261
8 Capacity Planning and Dimensioning
make a phone call at the same time and thus utilize all channels. In the event that this
happens, the cell is said to be blocked and a degradation in the quality-of-service to users
is experienced. In most modern cellular systems, when a call is rejected to access the
network, a busy tone is sent to the user and the call is immediately terminated.
Blocking represents a major problem, especially for indoor systems. As an example,
suppose an international airport has various macrocell sites around and relies on
macrocell penetration to provide service to customers. Even if the received signal
strength is sufﬁcient in most of the areas of the airport according to operator require­
ments, capacity may not be enough to accommodate all users, especially during busy
hour times or seasons. Not only is the airport left with blocked calls but users outside and
in the surroundings of the airport will also suffer from blocking as well. This is one of the
reasons why dedicated indoor cells need to be deployed in such busy venues, even
though coverage may be considered as sufﬁcient from outdoor cells.
8.3.2
Grade of Service
Also denoted as GoS, grade-of-service is the probability of a call in a circuit-switched
network being blocked or delayed for more than a speciﬁc interval. The GoS is normally
expressed as a percentile or a decimal fraction; for example 2% or 0.02. GoS is always
referenced to the busy-hour or when trafﬁc is more intense.
To determine the GoS of a network when the trafﬁc load and the number of channels
are known, the Erlang-B formula is used:
AC
C!
Pr 
(8.1)
K Ak
0 k!
where Pr is the GoS, A is the total offered trafﬁc in erlangs and C is the total number of
available channels. This formula is idealized as it does not attempt to make assumptions
about the call request rate and duration, but it is a useful start point for estimating the
number of channels required. Erlang-B assumes Poisson arrivals, call durations are
either at a ﬁxed length or exponentially distributed and blocked calls are not retried
immediately after receiving a busy signal.
It is important to recall that Erlang-B should be used when estimating the number of
channels in a cell. The decision of the cell borders should come from radio channel
modelling considerations, which account for propagation characteristics.
An Erlang-B graph (Figure 8.2) is often provided to quickly estimate the required
number of channels for a given GoS with an offered trafﬁc ﬁgure. Note that this graph is
only given as an approximation and exact values should be obtained using Equation (8.1).
8.3.3
Trafﬁc per User
Trafﬁc is measured in erlangs: one erlang (E) is equivalent to one user making a call for
100% of the time. A typical cellular voice user generates around 2-30 mE of trafﬁc during
the busiest hour of the system: that is, a typical user is active for around 0.2-3.0% of the
time during the busy hour. These ﬁgures tend to increase for indoor environments,
ﬂuctuating around 50-60 mE.

262

Figure 8.2 Erlang-B graph.
Trafﬁc per user Au is required if the trafﬁc per cell is to be computed. Therefore, a user
trafﬁc proﬁle is often described determined by different trafﬁc categories, as speciﬁed in
Section 8.3.4, in which an average mobile phone user makes λ calls of duration H during
the busy hour, where λ is known as the call request rate and H is the holding time. Hence,
the average trafﬁc per user is
Au  λH
(8.2)
8.3.4
Offered and Carried Trafﬁc
A distinction should be made here between offered and carried trafﬁc, for which a
different use of the Erlang unit is made.
When used to describe offered trafﬁc, a value followed by 'erlangs' represents the
average number of concurrent calls that would have been carried if there were an
unlimited number of circuits; that is if the call attempts that were made when all circuits
were in use had not been rejected or blocked.
When used to represent carried trafﬁc, a value followed by 'erlangs' represents the
average number of concurrent calls carried by the circuits or other service-providing
elements, where that average is calculated over some reasonable period of time. The
period over which the average is calculated is often one hour (the so-called busy hour for
indoor capacity calculations), but shorter periods (e.g. 15 minutes) may be used where it
is known that there are short spurts of demand and a trafﬁc measurement is desired that
does not mask these spurts. For example, if a radio channel is occupied for one hour
continuously it is said to have a load of 1 erlang. Thus, for U users in the cell, the total
carried trafﬁc A is given by
A  UAu
(8.3)
The relationship between offered trafﬁc and carried trafﬁc depends on the design of the
system and user behaviour. Three common models are (a) callers whose call-attempts
are rejected go away and never come back, (b) callers whose call-attempts are rejected try

again within a fairly short space of time and (c) the system allows users to wait in queue
until a circuit becomes available.
8.3.5
Trafﬁc Categories
Indoor radio users exhibit distinct behaviour depending on a given trafﬁc proﬁle. This
trafﬁc proﬁle speciﬁes the way each user will load the wireless system and since these
proﬁles normally change on a daily basis, average values should be taken. Depending on
the type of user, some user loads for voice trafﬁc can be considered as indicated in
Table 8.1 (Tolstrup, 2011).
This is one useful way to categorize the various types of trafﬁc that can be utilizing
radio resources in a building, but it is worth pointing out that wireless service providers
and cellular operators may have their own trafﬁc proﬁles to dimension the network for
capacity.
In general, users in a wireless network are distinguished by several factors:
 Service levels (voice, email, web browsing, video, streaming, . . . )
 Technologies (UMTS, HSPA, LTE, Wi-Fi, . . . )
 Spectrum bands (cellular, PCS, AWS, ISM, . . . )
 Trafﬁc (expected usage of network resources).
When deﬁning service types, the characteristics of each technology should be taken
into account, in order to establish reasonable trafﬁc proﬁles. For example, for cellular
systems, the radio designer should recall that:
 GSM does not support any data service - perhaps only very constrained and limited
using GPRS.
 HSPA does not support voice, only data.
 LTE does not support circuit-switched voice, only VoIP.
Having this in mind, it is possible to create a subscriber mix, which is deﬁned as the
average percentage of users that use a particular service type. Therefore, for example, for
an LTE subscriber mix, it can be assumed that 25% of the trafﬁc is voice, 10% is email,
25% is web browsing, 8% is video conferencing, 12% is video streaming and 20% is data
download.
A more detailed classiﬁcation and explanation will be given in the next section, related
to data capacity, which inherently considers, for example, very low data rate services in
which voice may be included.

264
Indoor Wireless Communications
8.4 Data Transmission Parameters
Much like GoS is used for circuit voice user capacity, as described in Section 8.3, there
are other capacity parameters used for data user capacity, which are described here.
Capacity planning for data trafﬁc needs to be contemplated, especially for UMTS and
LTE cellular systems, where a signiﬁcant amount of the total network trafﬁc is data. For
this, Erlang-B calculations cannot be employed, but we must be aware that data trafﬁc
will take up capacity that could have been used for voice. If dimensioning for data, data
rates for uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) are normally speciﬁed, and this depends on the
way, for example, operators deﬁne typical user proﬁles for data services; for example
384 kbps DL, 128 kbps UL for a user who normally downloads more data than uploads.
Since each operator or wireless provider deﬁnes speciﬁc trafﬁc proﬁles for data
according to marketing studies and other factors, typical user rates are hard to exemplify
and capacity dimensioning needs to be done for very speciﬁc cases and scenarios.
8.4.1
Delay
Delay covers the time required to establish the service when a request is made and the
time required when information is received. Delay could have a big impact on the user
satisfaction depending on the types of service and applications.
Delay or latency contributors are the user equipment, network and the server. Digital
mobile signals require a signiﬁcant amount of signal processing in the terminal and the
network before a service is delivered. There are exchanges of signalling between the
devices and the network in order to establish a secure and reliable connection. The radio
access network (RAN) and the core network (CN) can be optimized and conﬁgured for
minimum latency. The MNOs are constantly carrying out surveys to reduce the round trip
time (RTT) where possible. These are comparatively static latency contributors, which can
be optimized by reconﬁguration of the network when a new service is introduced.
A signiﬁcant contributor to latency is the call setup. Depending on the state of the
mobile, the call setup can take from 200 ms to 2000 ms depending on the network
conﬁguration. Mobile applications development should take account of the way the
mobile communicates with the network to minimize the amount of exchanges required
before a request is completed.
8.4.2
Throughput
Another important dynamic contributor is the network throughput, that is the capability
to handle large amounts of trafﬁc. Throughput depends on the network bandwidth,
which is affected by the hardware capacity (the number of channel cards), the backhaul
transmission capacity (leased line or Ethernet) and the network noise rise due to trafﬁc
load. These have to be properly planned and catered for during the network planning
process.
8.4.3
Latency
There are some services that require the delivery of packets with a minimum delay in
order not to degrade the quality of service. One of the measures or key performance

265
8 Capacity Planning and Dimensioning
indicators (KPIs) that is frequently used for this is latency. Network latency is a measure
of how much time it takes for a packet of data to get from one designated point to
another. For example, for service classes with critical timing such as voice, to keep
latency to a minimum is essential. In fact, with the imminent deployment of 5G networks
in the near future, latency is one of the key parameters that guarantees the expected
quality of service for many types of service to be offered, since this parameter is expected
to be lower than previous standards. Real-time services are therefore expected, for
example, for connected factories (or factories of the future) and thus special attention
should be paid to this parameter.
8.5
Capacity Limits
There are two types of capacity limits that a wireless technology may have:
 Hard limit
 Soft limit.
Hard limit is technology limit that constrains capacity and is determined by the
number of:
 Time slots per carrier (GSM)
 Walsh codes per carrier (UMTS)
 HSPA codes per carrier (HSPA)
 Resource blocks per carrier (LTE).
When the hard limit in a network is reached, the system will refuse connection until
resources become available. These resources are normally categorized as time slots,
codes or resource blocks depending on the speciﬁc technology.
On the other hand, soft capacity limit is inﬂuenced by factors related to power:
transmit power limitation and interference. Thus, to achieve a certain service level, the
user equipment must maintain a certain SINR, Eb=N0 or C=I for that service level.
Therefore, for a given SINR at the user equipment, the base station should allocate
adequate power to that user, whereby two cases may occur:
 Let us assume there is strong interference close to the UE, so to achieve the target
SINR there may not be enough power.
 Even if interference is low, the UE may be quite far away from the base station (Node
B), in which case the transmit power may also not be available.
One of the consequences of having a soft capacity limit is that when the QoS target is
not guaranteed, the UE is assigned a lower data throughput rate.
8.6
Radio Resource Management
Radio resource management (RRM) is a set of algorithms used for optimal utilization of
various parameters such as transmit power, channel allocation, handover criteria,
modulation scheme, error coding scheme, etc., to control co-channel interference
and other radio transmission characteristics in wireless communication systems. The

266
Indoor Wireless Communications
ultimate objective of RRM is the use of limited radio spectrum resources and radio
network infrastructure as efﬁciently as possible.
RRM deals with multiuser and multicell network capacity issues, to achieve maximum
capacity when several users and adjacent base stations share the same frequency channel.
These capacity enhancements can supersede those provided by advanced source and
channel coding schemes, in particular using dynamic RRM strategies.
For wireless systems such as cellular, WLAN and broadcasting networks, where the
limiting factor is often co-channel interference rather than noise, RRM plays an essential
role in optimizing the use of spectrum.
RRM is a wide topic that certainly is out of the scope of this book. In the context of
various wireless technologies and those related to network planning and dimensioning,
an excellent reference is Stasiak et al. (2011).
8.7 Load Sharing: Base Station Hotels
One strategy that has been employed in recent years to optimize capacity resources for
buildings is load sharing, where various network resources can be shared by a collection
of neighbouring buildings and hence maximize resourcing. The principle behind this
sharing is that different venues and buildings will have distinct trafﬁc proﬁles that
depend on the time of the day, day of the week and the season, and thus load proﬁles can
be combined to increase trunking gain. For example, a shopping centre will have low
trafﬁc until opening hours and no trafﬁc at night, having more peaks during weekends
than in weekdays. On the other hand, an ofﬁce building exhibits a similar behaviour to
that of a shopping centre on weekdays, but for weekends no trafﬁc is experienced. If radio
resources are shared amongst the two buildings, load proﬁles can be combined and thus
the resources of the cell can be much better used.
Abase station hotel is the technique where coverage and capacity is provided by a
centralized base station to buildings located in the same area. This solution provides a
low-cost alternative for areas where high capacity demands exist and for which the
number of cells need to be increased. The connection between the base station
equipment room and each remote site is connected normally using a single optical
ﬁbre.
In the centralized base station hotel multiple services can be fed to a central main DAS
unit, from which optical ﬁbre is fed to the individual antenna locations connecting
remote units to the DAS. Note that both the DAS master and remote units have modular
capabilities for new cards or ampliﬁers to be added if required should network expansion
be neededTolstrup (2011).
One of the greatest advantages of this concept is that the central base station hotel
could be located in an existing equipment room, thus resolving potential lack of space for
remote locations that support multioperator and/or multitechnology solutions. The use
of optical ﬁbre allows distances between the central base station hotel and the remote
units of more than 15 km to be reached.
In summary, with the use of a base station hotel, capacity can be extended on demand
without the need to invest in additional infrastructure at the remote locations but instead
add functionality to the centralized base station and easily deploy remote units at the
required locations.

267

8.8
Trafﬁc Mapping
It is common practice for operators to assume even user density across a building, which
is sufﬁciently valid if the building is reasonably small; however, for denselypopulated
buildings such as airports and shopping centres, another method to distribute this user
density is required. For example, an airport has many areas where user loads can be
clearly observed to change as a plane lands and large bursts of passengers walk through
the piers towards immigration control, in many cases making an extensive use of their
mobile phones. Clearly, this trafﬁc proﬁle should be different to that in an arrivals lounge
where people are waiting for passengers to arrive or to baggage reclaim zones. For Wi-Fi
networks, throughput can be substantially reduced if high bursts of trafﬁc in wireless
hotspots are not accounted for, especially in those environments having uneven user
distribution, making use of network resources extensively, such as airports, train
stations, shopping centres, etc.
A technique to distribute the building population and trafﬁc was derived from
mobility models, producing trafﬁc maps according to user density (Aragón-Zavala
et al., 2009). This suggests a much better use of network resources and a better
estimation of the required number of channels to avoid blocking, which by no means
can be derived simply by examining network statistics and previous trafﬁc per existing
cell. The difﬁculty for allocating enough channels per cell and moreover to determine the
number and location of such cells is essential and, along with coverage predictions from
the building in consideration, this can be performed.
Trafﬁc mapping was conceived as a mapping exercise that was developed to allocate
radio resources according to trafﬁc demands, and how channels are allocated in
accordance with such uneven user distributions across a building, mainly for voice
in GSM systems. It was successfully used at the beginning of the millennium
(2000-2003), especially to dimension trafﬁc resources for airports. Nowadays with
the increase of data trafﬁc, these methods are insufﬁcient and other methodologies need
to be used, which will be described in Section 8.9.
8.9
Capacity Calculations
Different approaches should be followed to dimension a network for capacity, consid­
ering many aspects such as:
 Circuit-switched (voice) or packet-switched (data) services
 Wireless technology (cellular, Wi-Fi, etc.)
 Standards (GSM, UMTS, LTE, HSPA, etc.)
 Trafﬁc forecasts to account for future growth
 Deployment scenario.
The speciﬁc method may slightly vary from one technology to another, but in general
techniques for voice and techniques for data have similarities regardless of other
technical details.
Recently the ITU-R has published recommendations and a methodology to calculate
spectrum requirements for IMT based on the new cellular standards, which carry a
signiﬁcant amount of data trafﬁc (ITU, 2013). The methodology is applicable to packet

switch-based trafﬁc and can accommodate multiple services. Based on this methodology,
some guidelines are given in this section.
8.9.1
Service Categories
According to ITU(2013), a service category (SC) is deﬁnedas a combination of service type
and trafﬁc class as shown in Table 8.2. The ITU lists these service categories using speciﬁc
numbers (e.g. SC4), and for each service type there are four trafﬁc classes: conversational,
streaming, interactive and background. These trafﬁc classes are explained in the following
section.
8.9.1.1
Service Types
Peak bit rates are used to categorize the service types, for which service demanding
similar peak rates can be grouped together. The following service types can be identiﬁed:
 Very low data rate, requiring peak bit rates of up to 16 kbps. Speech and simple
message services fall within this service type. Applications related to sensor networks
or low data rate telemetry are examples of this service type.
 Low data rate and low multimedia, supporting data rates up to 144 kbps. This service
type accounts for all pre-IMT-2000 data communication applications.
 Medium multimedia, with a peak data rate of 2 Mbps. Recall that IMT-2000 data
communications such as those deﬁned in 3G support this data rate and therefore this
service type aims at sustaining compatibility with these applications.
 High multimedia, accommodating high data rate applications up to 30 Mbps including
video streaming services, those that are provided with xDSL services for ﬁxed wired
communications.
 Super-high multimedia, supporting super-high data rates multimedia applications,
currently provided using ﬁbre-to-the-home (FTTH) services in ﬁxed wired networks.
Data rates vary from 30 Mbps to 100 Mbps/1 Gbps.
8.9.1.2
Trafﬁc Classes
This methodology applies the trafﬁc classes described in ITU (2003), for which four
quality-of-service classes are deﬁned from the user perspective:
 Conversational, such as telephony speech. Other applications may require this scheme,
such as voice-over-IP (VoIP) and videoconferencing tools. Real-time conversation is

269
8 Capacity Planning and Dimensioning
characterized by a low transfer time, hence restricting the limit for acceptable transfer
delay. If this maximum delay is exceeded, the result may be an unacceptable lack of
quality in the conversation or videoconference.
 Streaming, which occurs when the user is looking at real-time video or listening to
audio. This real-time data ﬂow always aims at a live (human) destination, not a
machine. Data ﬂow must be preserved, although there are no requirements on low
transfer delay. The end-to-end delay variation must be limited, to preserve the time
relation between information entities of the stream. Normally, the highest acceptable
delay variation over the transmission media is related to the capability of the time
alignment function of the application; thus delay variation is much greater than the
one given by human perception.
 Interactive, when the end user (machine or human) is online requesting data from
remote equipment, such as in web browsing, database retrieval, server access, etc.,
for human interaction with remote equipment, or polling measurement records
and automatic database enquires for machine interaction with remote equipment.
For interactive trafﬁc, at the message destination, there is an entity expecting a
message (response) within a certain time and therefore round-trip delay is of
importance here. The content of the packets must be transparently transferred,
having low BER.
 Background, when the end user (typically a computer) sends and receives data in
the background, as is the case for e-mail, SMS, download of databases and the
reception of measurement records. The absence of a parameter at the destination
expecting to receive the data within a certain time limit characterizes this scheme,
although there is still a delay constraint since data are effectively useless if received
too late for any practical purpose. Thus, this scheme is more or less delivery time
insensitive.
As can be seen above, the key difference amongst them is how delay-sensitive the
application is. For these four trafﬁc classes, conversational and streaming are served
with circuit switching whereas interactive and background are served with packet
switching.
8.9.1.3
Service Category Parameters
SCs are characterized by parameters that are obtained either from market studies or
from other sources. Relevant parameters are (ITU, 2006b):
 User density, in users per km2
 Session arrival rate per user, in sessions/s per user
 Mean service bit rate, in bps
 Mean session duration, in s/session
 Mobility ratio.
The mobility parameter is used in trafﬁc distribution whereas the other parameters
characterize the demand of different service categories. Terminal mobility is related to
application usage parameters and is deﬁned in ITU (1999) as:
 In-building
 Pedestrian
 Vehicular.

270
Indoor Wireless Communications
Mobility requirements depend upon the speed of the mobile stations, for which
mobility classes are categorized as follows (ITU, 2006a):
 Stationary, 0 km=h
 Low mobility, speed between 0 km=h and 4 km=h
 High mobility, speed between 4 km=h and 100 km=h
 Super-high mobility, speed between 100 km=h and 250 km=h:
These range limits should be related to typical characteristics of cellular radio networks.
Therefore, for application of the mobility classes in the methodology, the mobility classes
from market studies are redeﬁned as follows:
 Stationary/pedestrian, speed between 0 km=h and 4 km=h
 Low mobility, speed between 4 km=h and 50 km=h
 High mobility, speed greater than 50 km=h
8.9.2
Service Environment
A service environment is deﬁned in ITU (2013) as a combination of a service usage
pattern and teledensity, and represents common service usage and volume conditions.
A service usage pattern is a common user(s) behaviour in a given service area and is
categorized according to an area where users exploit similar services and expect similar
QoS. The following service usage patterns are used:
 Home
 Ofﬁce
 Public area.
On the other hand, population density and the number of devices per person are
relevant factors when considering service environments. Thus, geographical area is
divided according to these factors into teledensity categories. Each teledensity parameter
is characterized by population density and communication device density. Teledensity is
categorized into the following:
 Dense urban
 Suburban
 Rural.
Service environments are deﬁned for the combinations of teledensity and service
usage patterns as shown in Table 8.3. Examples of user groups and applications of service
environments are as follows (ITU, 2013):
SE1. User groups: private user, business user. Applications: voice, Internet access, games,
e-commerce, remote education, multimedia applications.
SE2. User groups: business user, small and medium enterprise. Applications: voice,
Internet access, video conferencing, e-commerce, mobile business applications.
SE3. User groups: private user, business user, public service user, tourist, sales people.
Applications: voice, Internet access, video conferencing, mobile business applications,
tourist information, e-commerce.
SE4. User groups: private user, business user. Applications: voice, Internet access, games,
e-commerce, multimedia applications, remote education.

When designing for capacity, spectrum requirements should ﬁrst be calculated sepa­
rately for each teledensity. The ﬁnal spectrum requirements are calculated by taking the
maximum value amongst spectrum requirements for the three teledensity areas deﬁned
above.
8.9.3
Radio Environment
Radio environments (RE) are deﬁned by the cell layers in a network consisting of
hierarchical cell layers, that is macro, micro, pico and hot-spot cells. The cell areas for the
different radio environments are used in capacity calculations by the method speciﬁed in
ITU (2013).
In addition to the limits on cell sizes related to network deployment costs and the
spectrum requirement, technical limits exist. The upper technical limit is determined by
the propagation conditions, terminal transmit power limitations and delay spread. The
lower technical limits for the cell sizes are determined by an increase in unfavourable
interference conditions; however, this limit is negligible compared to the limit imposed
by deployment costs.
As the deployment of micro, pico and hot-spot cells do not greatly vary between
teledensity areas, the assumption of taking the same 'maximum' cell area is made for the
spectrum calculation method. Macro cells are different, since the teledensity has an
impact on the targeted cell area as well as on the deployment of base stations. Therefore,
the cell area of a macro cell is made teledensity-dependent in spectrum requirement
calculations. Examples of maximum cell areas per RE are included in ITU (2013) for
various teledensity areas, as denoted in Table 8.4.
Since the availability of REs depends on the service environment, the total area of a
particular service environment is only covered to a certain percentage X by each radio
environment. Therefore, example coverage percentages that are used in distributing the
trafﬁc amongst REs are given in ITU (2013) as follows:

SE1: macrocell, 100%; microcell, 0%; picocell, 0% and hotspot, 80%

SE2: macrocell, 100%; microcell, 0%; picocell, 20% and hotspot, 80%

Radio Access Technology Groups (RATGs)
The RATGs that have been considered in the methodology contemplate four groups as
follows:
Group 1. Pre-IMT systems, IMT-2000 and its enhancements
Group 2. IMT-Advanced systems
Group 3. Existing radio local area networks (LANs) and their enhancements
Group 4. Digital mobile broadcasting systems and their enhancements.
The ﬁrst two RATGs are used in all the methodology, whereas the last two only are
considered for the ﬁrst steps.
Required radio parameters for each group are presented in ITU (2013) and are used as
an example for the subsequent calculations. The use of more realistic ﬁgures for various
indoor environments is presented in Chapter 11.
8.9.5
Methodology Flowchart
The generic ﬂowchart for the spectrum requirement calculation methodology is shown
in Figure 8.3. In summary, the methodology is as follows:
Step 1. Present the different deﬁnitions used in the methodology, as given in Sections
8.9.1, 8.9.2, 8.9.3 and 8.9.4.

Market Data Analysis
From the ﬂowchart in Figure 8.3 and once all variables and terms have been properly
deﬁned, obtain market data from surveys and questionnaires, which included items such
as services and market survey for existing mobile services, service and market forecast,
driving forces for future markets, other views of future services, key market parameters,

274
Indoor Wireless Communications
etc. Data are provided for the years 2010, 2015 and 2020 according to the responses in
such questionnaires included in ITU (2006a).
In order to perform an exhaustive market data analysis, the following steps should be
followed:
List up applications and services, so that services are chosen not to be overlapped from
an application that can be general and essential enough to categorize all collected
services properly. As an example, if Internet access is selected as one service, trafﬁc
attributes such as the mean service bit rate should be speciﬁed, for example 10 Mbps.
More examples are listed in ITU (2013).
Specify trafﬁc attribute values for each service. These are related to trafﬁc characteristics
of the service. Attribute values such as mean service rate and average session duration
need to be speciﬁed for each service deﬁned earlier.
Specify market attribute values for each service. These are related tousers' perspectives.
The idea here is no longer to have ﬁxed and geographically equal amounts of spectrum
allocated to each RATG but to allow the RATGs to give a spectrum to each other
during times when it is unused. This provides a time-varying and regionally-varying
nature of trafﬁc for different RATGs. For analysing the market data, values of user
density and session arrival rate per user for each service on each environment and time
interval need to be speciﬁed.
Map services into a service category table for each SE. Each service can be mapped into a
table composed of service type and trafﬁc class. This table needs to be developed for
each service environment.
Compute market attribute values for each SC, SE and time interval. This is fully deﬁned
in the next section.
8.9.7
Trafﬁc Demand Calculation by SE and SC
From the previous section, the last step in market data analysis consists of computing
market attribute values for each SC, SE and time interval. The relevant parameters to be
considered in the methodology are as follows:
 User density (users/km2) of a certain SC is the sum of user densities of each service
mapped into the SC:
Um;t;n 
Um;t;s
(8.4)
s ∈n
where Um;t;n and Um;t;s represent the user density of SC n and the user density of service s
inside SC n.
 Session arrival rate per user (sessions/suser) of a certain service category is the
weighted average of session arrival rate per user of each service mapped to this service
category. The weight of each service is the user density. Thus:
Um;t;sQm;t;s
s ∈n

(8.5)
Qm;t;n
Um;t;n
where Qm;t;n and Qm;t;s represent the session arrival rate per user of service category n
and the session arrival rate per user of service s inside SC n.

275
8 Capacity Planning and Dimensioning
 Average session duration (s/session) of a certain SC is the weighted average of an
average session duration of each service mapped to this SC. The weight is the session
arrival rate per area. Thus:

wm;t;sμm;t;s
(8.6)
s ∈n
μm;t;n
and
Um;t;sQm;t;s
wm;t;s 
(8.7)
Um;t;nQm;t;n
where μ
and μ
represent the average session duration of service category n and
m;t;n
m;t;s
the average session duration of service s inside SC n.
 Mean service bit rate (bps) of a certain service category is the weighted average of the
mean service rates of each service mapped to this SC. The weight is the sum of the
average durations of all sessions that arrive during a unit time per area. Thus:
rm;t;n 
wm;t;srm;t;s
(8.8)
and
Um;t;sQm;t;sμm;t;s
wm;t;s 
(8.9)
Um;t;nQm;t;nμm;t;n
where rm;t;n and rm;t;s represent the service data rate of service category n and the service
data rate of service s inside SC n.
 Mobilty ratio of a certain service category is the weighted average of each mobility
ratio for a user of SC of each service mapped to the SC, and this mobility ratio is
assumed to be not time-dependent. Thus:
MR_marketm;t;n 
wm;t;sMR_marketm;s
(8.10)
where MR_marketm;t;n and MR_marketm;t;sdenote the mobility ratio of service cate­
gory n and the mobility ratio of service s inside SC n, and is applied to all mobility cases.
The mobility ratios MR_market for stationary (sm), low (lm), high (hm) and super-high
mobility (shm) need to be mapped into the methodology mobility ratios MR for
stationary/pedestrian (sm), low (lm) and high mobility (hm) as follows:
MR_smm;t;n  MR_market_smm;t;n  MR_market_lmm;t;n
(8.11)
MR_lmm;t;n  JmMR_market_hmm;t;n
(8.12)
MR_hmm;t;n  1  JmMR_market_hmm;t;n  MR_market_shmm;t;n
(8.13)
Note that Jm are factors that depend on the service environment, as given in Table 8.5.
8.9.8
Trafﬁc Distribution Amongst RATGs
Each service environment is supported by one or more RATGs, so trafﬁc per service
environment can be distributed to trafﬁc per RATGs.

Distribution Ratios
The distribution ratios ξm;t;n;rat;p are used to distribute session arrival rates into RATGs
and REs. These ratios need to be derived separately for different SCs in different SEs and
time intervals for uplink and downlink trafﬁc. The distribution ratios are deﬁned in three
phases:
 Phase 1, which determines which combination of RATG and RE cannot support a
given service category in a given SE. Therefore, zero distribution ratios apply for:
- RATG4 for unicast SC
-
REs that do not exist in the considered SE
- REs that are not supported by a given RATG
- Combination of RATG and RE for which the application data rate from RATG
deﬁnitions is smaller than the required data rate of a particular SC
- Macrocell RE for those RATG that do not support the entire range of velocities
associated with the high mobility classes deﬁned before.
 Phase 2 distributes trafﬁc between RATGs. The distribution ratio depends on the
available RATG in each RE and SE, as speciﬁed in Phase 1. Table 8.6 shows an example
of distribution ratios amongst available RATGs as suggested in TU (2013).
 Phase 3 distributes the trafﬁc amongst the radio environments based on mobility
ratios and coverage percentages. Since the methodology deﬁnes the mobility classes
stationary/pedestrian, low and high, the mapping of mobility classes to radio environ­
ments should be done, as indicated in Table 8.7. This mapping is assumed to be the
same for all RATGs, and the velocity ranges and parameter maximum supported
velocity of each RE are chosen accordingly.
Trafﬁc distribution follows the principle to use the RE with the lowest mobility
support that just satisﬁes the requirements. According to this, all stationary/pedestrian
trafﬁc would go to hotspots and picocells, all low mobility to microcells and all high
mobility to macrocells. In practice, the total area of a particular SE is only covered a
certain percentage X by each RE.
Table 8.8 deﬁnes the population coverage percentage of each radio environment as an
example given in ITU (2013). This population coverage is independent of the RATG, but
if a particular RATG does not support a certain RE at all then the corresponding cell edge

trafﬁc distribution will force the corresponding distribution ratio to zero.
Using the population coverage percentages Xhs, Xpico, Xmicro and Xmacro, the algorithm
distributes the following trafﬁc proportions to the hotspot, pico, micro and macro radio
environments:

8.9.8.2
Distribution of Session Arrival Rates
The session arrival rate per area of SC n and SE m distributed to RATG rat and RE p in
time interval t, denoted as Pm;t;n;rat;p; is computed from the distribution ratio ξm;t;n;rat;p,
the user density Um;t;n and the session arrival rate per user Qm;t;n calculated in
Equation (8.5) as follows:
Pm;t;n;rat;p  ξm;t;n;rat;p ? Um;t;n ? Qm;t;n
(8.20)
Recall that
ξm;t;n;rat;p  1
(8.21)
Thus
Pm;t;n;rat;p  Um;t;n ? Qm;t;n
(8.22)
In order to get the trafﬁc accumulated from all users in a cell, the session arrival rate/cell
is computed as
P´

m;t;n;rat;p  Pm;t;n;rat;p ? Ad;p
where Ad;p represents the cell area in km2 of RATG rat in teledensity d and RE p. Note

Offered Trafﬁc
The offered trafﬁc needs to be computed for each service category. The conversational
and streaming classes are served with circuit switching, whereas the background and
interactive classes are served with packet switching.
For circuit switching, the aggregate values of the product of session arrival rate per cell
and average session duration for different teledensities d are collected to the offered
trafﬁc ρd;t;n;rat;p. This represents the sum of average durations of all sessions of SC n that
arrive per unit time in a cell with teledensity d, RATG rat and radio environment p in
time interval t:

Carried Trafﬁc Capacity Determination
The required system capacity (bps) is determined separately for circuit-switched
(denoted as Cd;t;rat;p;cs) and packet-switched (Cd;t;rat;p;ps) trafﬁc. The number of cir­
cuit-switched service categories is denoted as Ncs, while the number of packet-switched
service categories is Nps. Note that the total number of service categories N is given by
N  Ncs  Nps.
8.9.9.1
Circuit-Switched Trafﬁc
For circuit-switched trafﬁc, the Erlang-B formula can be extended to the multi­
dimensional case, which also allows simultaneous occupation of several channels by
each call. Let the system state be i  i1; i2; . . . ; iNcs where im is the number of calls of

obtained by multiplying the required total number of channels by the bit rate of the
channel:
Cd;t;rat;p;cs  κ ? r
(8.29)
where κ is the required number of channels per cell and r is the bit rate per channel, in
bps. Therefore, κ is obtained as the smallest v that satisﬁes the following conditions (for a

Packet-Switched Trafﬁc
For packet-switched trafﬁc, the system capacity needs to fulﬁl each SC's mean delay
requirement, which can be done using a queuing model applicable for independent
arrival times of packets and an arbitrary distribution of packet size. Since the complexity
of this algorithm is out of the scope of this book, we leave for the reader to investigate
further the detailed calculations for the packet-switched capacity in ITU (2013). Case
study examples have been included in Chapter 11 for completeness.
8.10
Wi-Fi Capacity
The best way to illustrate Wi-Fi capacity considerations is through an example. Since
Chapter 11 case studies focus mainly on cellular network deployments, a Wi-Fi example
is presented here for reference.
8.10.1
The Challenge
Let us assume a large shopping mall has a ﬂoor area of 140000 m2 and 45 million visitors
annually, which makes it a very attractive venue for potentially mobile Internet and other
high-speed, high-volume applications. It has a high percentage of customers using
smartphones due to a large number of technology stores and youth attractions. A
distributed antenna system (DAS) was built to provide cellular coverage, but is running
out of capacity, and there is no good business case for upgrading it. We wish to use Wi-Fi
to ofﬂoad the excess capacity - we need to design the Wi-Fi network to deliver this
without excessive cost. Figure 8.4 shows the layout of the shopping centre.
8.10.2
Facts and Figures
To start with, let us have a look at some relevant ﬁgures that were given to us at the
beginning of the project:
 There is a market share of 30%.
 The penetration of data-capable mobile devices for the demographic in the shopping
mall is expected to reach and stabilize at 80% in the next two years.

281
8 Capacity Planning and DimensioningA layout depicting the shopping centre example used for Wi-Fi capacity calculations.
Figure 8.4 Shopping centre example used for Wi-Fi capacity calculations.
 We are experiencing a doubling of data volumes annually.
 We want to design our Wi-Fi system to ofﬂoad excess demand for the next 3 years.
 Currently our DAS network, which has four HSPA sectors, is running 10% over
capacity.
 There are lots of other access points in the mall, causing an effective noise rise of 3 dB
throughout the 2.4 GHz band.
 We are aiming for a cell edge throughput of 10 Mbps.

282
Indoor Wireless Communications
8.10.3
Coverage Design
Coverage and capacity in a Wi-Fi network are closely related. Thus, designing for
coverage needs to be accomplished ﬁrst. For coverage purposes, our aim is to have
10 Mbps at the cell edge over a ﬂoor area of 140000 m2, according to the given ﬁgures
related to the mall. Therefore, we need to decide which Wi-Fi technology to use, which
as yet has not been speciﬁed. Although 802.11 n delivers higher throughputs than 11 b/g,
it requires wider MIMO antennas and support in the mobile device, which is currently
unusual; therefore, we need to select 802.11 b/g for this purpose, and by looking at some
graphs for 10 Mbps, a cell-edge SINR of 6 dB is required. If interference causes a noise
rise of about 3 dB, we require a signal level of:
Given our calculated target received signal, we ﬁnd the maximum path loss from our
link budget. The following assumptions are made:
 20 dBm EIRP
 Client devices have antenna gain of 5 dBi (including some body loss)
Hence:
Using the ITU-R P.1238 propagation model described in Chapter 5, the range is
computed as:
Having a coverage area of 140000 m2, this is equivalent to a square area of
374  374 m, approximately. Therefore, if we assume an overlap of 30% of the cell
radius is enough for handovers (Figure 8.5), then
o  0:3d
d  2  26  52 m

Capacity Design
Next, let us determine our capacity demands for the system. In general, from the facts
and ﬁgures, although we have information related to market share and the penetration of
smartphones used in the mall, what we really need to estimate our current capacity is the
fact that the cellular DAS is running 10% over capacity with four HSPA carriers. To
project for three years time, the doubling of data volumes annually is taken and the fact is
that we will be using Wi-Fi to ofﬂoad this extra capacity.
Therefore, assuming one HSPA sector has a realistic capacity of 1.5 Mbps, then
Current demand  3  sector capacity  10%
 3  1:5  1:1
 4:95 Mbps
Demand in three years  4:95  2  2  2  39:6 Mbps
If this demand is spread evenly over the area, the demand per access point is 39.6 Mbps/
101 = 392 kbps.
8.10.5
Additional Challenges
Some assumptions were made during our design process, which may need to be revised
at this stage. For example, we have dimensioned our system assuming users are

284
Indoor Wireless Communications
uniformly distributed over the mall ﬂoor area. This may not be the case for many areas in
the mall, and in fact there is a food court area of 10000 m2 that contains 20% of the
shoppers at lunchtime, who they use their devices twice as heavily as the average. Also,
the food court has more devices in the 2.4 GHz band, resulting in an increase in the
noise-ﬂoor. We therefore need to determine the number of required access points to
provide capacity for this area as follows:
 This implies 2  20%  40% of the nominal total demand in three years is in the food
court; that is 0:4  39:6 Mbps  15:84 Mbps.
 This area is covered by approximately 10 000=140 000  101  7 access points.
 Therefore, each access point serves 15:84=7  2:3 Mbps. This is well within the
capacity of an access point so no extra installation is needed.
 However, a 5 dB increase in the noise-ﬂoor requires more APs.
As you can see in the calculations above, these new requirements imply that the
nominal total demand is now increased to 15.84 Mbps. If we estimate the number of APs
that are considered for this area with the current estimations, 7 APs are to be used here,
and each AP serves about 2.3 Mbps, which is well within the capacity of an AP and
therefore no need for additional installation is envisaged. However, the noise rise
increase makes this increase in APs inevitable.
The reason why more APs are needed if the noise rise is increased is due to the cell-
edge requirements, to guarantee the minimum SINR speciﬁed - if the noise is increased,
the signal levels have also to be increased to maintain the SINR.
Using our propagation model, we can determine that 5 dB in path loss corresponds to
a ratio of previous and new radius of
r1  105=10n
r2
If we say the ratio of the number of APs is inversely proportional to the square of the
distances, then

Therefore, the food court requires 2:3  7  16 access points.

Data Ofﬂoading Considerations
An extensive growth in mobile data trafﬁc has been seen in the last few years, especially
with the launch of more sophisticated devices such as smartphones, capable of handling
much more data volumes, and it is expected that for the next ﬁve years there will be an
exponential growth of mobile data trafﬁc. Interestingly enough, the number of sub­
scribers will not follow the same trend - it is expected to grow at a much slower pace.
Nowadays, more devices are getting connected to the Internet, and a very large increase
in trafﬁc indoors, of about 80%, has been reported. This brings new challenges to
operators and service providers, in order to have enough network resources to satisfy
such increasing demands.

285
8 Capacity Planning and Dimensioning
Figure 8.6 The data ofﬂoading scenario for capacity.
Since one of the elements that has inﬂuenced most of the growth in mobile data trafﬁc
has been mobile device evolution, mobile terminals and handsets have evolved in the last
years, commencing with dongles in 2007, towards the advent of smartphones in 2009
and tablets in 2010. Therefore, mobile broadband demand has already been through at
least three major evolutions arising from devices in the last few years. Interestingly
enough, parallel growth in data revenue and data volume is not observed; whereas
historically in the UK revenues were growing more or less aligned with volume, the
forecast shows that available revenue per bit is declining steeply, even as user expect­
ations of connectivity and speed are rising. On the other hand, trafﬁc growth is expected
to growth exponentially, which brings major concerns as to ﬁnding ways to rapidly
reduce the cost per bit.
Conventionally, mobile data trafﬁc has been handled towards the macro radio network,
which through the transport and core networks connects to the Internet and brings this
trafﬁc back to the mobile portable devices, thus imposing a very large trafﬁc demand in the
macronetwork.Ontheotherhand,theconceptofanofﬂoadednetworkusesa femto/Wi-Fi
radio network to carry the trafﬁc generated by portable devices and in this way ofﬂoading
transport and core networks since access to the Internet is now possible directly, unlike in
conventional networks. This allows the transport and core networks to only deal with
signalling data and all user data are conveyed towards the Femto/Wi-Fi radio network,
hence maximizing network resources, as depicted in Figure 8.6.
In Figure 8.7, ofﬂoad of trafﬁc from smartphones and tablets is shown for the next ﬁve
years, where it was expected to gain an increasing share and volume of mobile device
trafﬁc to be ofﬂoaded to ﬁxed networks via Wi-Fi or femtocells. In August 2011, 37% of
mobile device access in the US was over Wi-Fi, up three percentage points in only three
months, something that suggests that the use of WLAN for handling mobile trafﬁc is
increasing. On the other hand, many phones are now equipped with Wi-Fi connectivity,
of which 74% of people having this feature in their phones use it. Moreover, Wi-Fi
connectivity in mobile phones and other portable devices is becoming increasingly

popular: 44% of smartphones had Wi-Fi in 2011 and by 2014 it was expected that 90%
would be equipped with Wi-Fi. Finally, and to fully have the picture of the increasing use
of Wi-Fi in portable devices, Wi-Fi enabled mobile phone shipments per year reached
141 million in 2009 and grew up to 520 million by 2014!
Figures 8.6 and 8.7 suggested a deﬁnite use of Wi-Fi for mobile applications, but recall
from the ﬁgures therewere still a small percentage of all phones in the market and Wi-Fi
were often not switched on or not always accessible.
According to the Wireless Broadband Alliance, 47% of mobile operator believe Wi-Fi
hotspots are very important or crucial to enhance customers' experience, ofﬂoad busy
mobile broadband and provide a value-added services platform. This is a very interesting
perspective that has radically changed, as in the early days of Wi-Fi and 3G, this was seen
as a competitor for cellular!
Major operators around the world are now adopting Wi-Fi ofﬂoad, supported by
industry initiatives to ease the process. In some cases they are building new custom Wi-
Fi networks, in others they are acquiring existing Wi-Fi providers while others are simply
opportunistically using existing third-party networks.
The following beneﬁts are identiﬁed:
 Improves user experience where it really matters: typically indoors.
 Reduces the cost per bit, by making use of available backhaul and unlicensed
spectrum, and third party (including customer) infrastructure.
 Ofﬂoads the trafﬁc where little operator value is added, while retaining control of
added value services and customer information; for example voice, SMS, MMS,
location-based services not ofﬂoaded, while video streaming is ofﬂoaded.
On the other hand, some risks are involved:
 Ofﬂoading data could lead to ofﬂoading of customer revenue and reduced loyalty.
 Use of third party infrastructure makes it hard to manage end-to-end customer
experience: who does the customer call when something goes wrong?
 User experience of Wi-Fi is very variable - great when it works, but seamless access,
authentication and speed are patchy.

287
8 Capacity Planning and Dimensioning
Figure 8.8 Data ofﬂoad via Wi-Fi.
8.11.1
Data Ofﬂoad Using Femtocells
One of the possibilities that was introduced to ofﬂoad trafﬁc from the macro network is
the use of femtocells. Femtocells ofﬂoad radio access network and backhaul - these
constitute the vast majority of cost in mobile networks, since access to the Internet can
be achieved without going through the RNC of the macro network. In fact, with Selected
IP Trafﬁc Ofﬂoad (SIPTO), femtocells can also ofﬂoad the core network, further
reducing cost and increasing scalability.
8.11.2
Data Ofﬂoad Using Wi-Fi
The second alternative is the ofﬂoad of trafﬁc via Wi-Fi. Three options are presented in
Figure 8.8, as follows:
 Network bypass.This method can be done straightforwardly, but a loss in control can
be experienced.
 Managed network bypass.This is similar to the previous one, but now metering and
monitoring are allowed. As a drawback, this approach does not support carrier-
management content over Wi-Fi.
 Integrated network ofﬂoad.This could be seen somehow as a combination of the
previous two, thus showing more seamless experience and carrier-managed content.
8.11.3
Femtocell versus Wi-Fi
Having provided an overview of the two possible alternatives for macro network trafﬁc
ofﬂoad, a comparison follows.
8.11.3.1
Wi-Fi
 Unlicensed spectrum: cheap but variable and prone to interference from other in-band
technologies
 Device support improving, but variable and user may disable
 Large installed base of access points, but not all suitable
 Risks reducing customer loyalty
 Seamless authentication, access and mobility are very variable.

288
Indoor Wireless Communications
8.11.3.2
Femtocells
 Licensed spectrum: good quality but need to manage
 Radio always on: addresses all devices
 Access point deployment growing fast but still in early stages
 Keeps customer ﬁrmly associated with operator, building loyalty
 Uses existing authentication, mobility and billing mechanisms for seamless extension
of existing network.
8.11.4
Carrier Wi-Fi
In order to achieve efﬁcient data ofﬂoad by using Wi-Fi, it has to be considered as part of
the mobile operator network. This ensures the delivery of acceptable and consistent
service, which otherwise could not be guaranteed. For example, suppose the Wi-Fi
service and the operator are not connected or linked whatsoever and the user is entering
a Wi-Fi zone for which the WISP does not have an agreement with the mobile operator.
How could the user be connected to such a network as part of an integrated, seamless
service, without the hassle of having to authenticate every time he joins in the Wi-Fi
zone?
Ways for achieving this integration have been proposed by many vendors (Ruckus
Wireless, Cisco, etc.) using reference architectures with advanced radio technology and
interference rejection techniques, comprehensive end-to-end management and fast
inexpensive backhaul links. Bear in mind that all of these require speciﬁc support in
the handset and the network, with some of them requiring support in the AP as well -
this should be considered when this integration is being planned.
8.11.5
UMA/GAN
There are two terms often used in Wi-Fi, which are used indistinctively and representing
almost the same technology. UMA, or Unlicensed Mobile Access, is a technology that
provides roaming between cellular networks and Wi-Fi. Under this context, the 3GPP
implementation of UMA is known as GAN, or Generic Access Network, a tele­
communication system that extends mobile voice, data and IP Multimedia Subsystem/
Session Initiation Protocol (IMS/SIP) applications over IP networks. Unlicensed Mobile
Access,orUMA,isthecommercial name usedbymobilecarriersforexternalIPaccess into
their core networks.
The UMA/GAN technology works as follows:
 UMA-enabled handset comes in range of UMA-enabled Wi-Fi.
 Handset connects to Wi-Fi and contacts UMA network controller (UNC).
 User gets authenticated and approved. Core network updated and voice and data
trafﬁc is routed via Wi-Fi instead of cellular.
 Roaming and handover between 2G/3G and GAN can in principle be transparent and
seamless, but there are risks of interruption and call quality degradation
The major challenge that UMA/GAN faces is the fact that relatively few phones (e.g.
not iPhones) support UMA and can involve deep changes. However, Blackberry devices
do support it and some Android devices can add UMA support via a user-installed

289

application - in summary, there are ways to go around this problem but still need further
development to allow devices to support this feature without too much complexity,
especially from a user's perspective.
Figure 8.9 depicts a simple architecture in which the core mobile network integrates
the cellular radio area network (RAN) with an unlicensed mobile access network
(UMAN) and how a UMA-enabled dual-mode handset can access both networks
and roam from one to another. This is essential for the integration of Wi-Fi technology
in mobile operator networks.
8.11.6
Seamless Authentication
Seamless authentication is a standard feature of 2G/3G/4G cellular, taken for granted by
users and operators alike. In Wi-Fi, however, this is not so straightforward and is seen by
operators as the biggest challenge for adoption. Authentication is the top barrier to wider
adoption and usage of Wi-Fi amongst end users.
The most favoured approach to this is now the 802.11 u standard, which includes
support for SIM-based authentication via the IETF's Extensible Authorization Protocol
(i.e. EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA for GSM/UMTS, respectively). This allows the subscriber's
proﬁle to be carried over from cellular into Wi-Fi and deliver similar security to the
cellular network.
8.11.7
Turning Wi-Fi into an Operator Network
Several additional initiatives are working to ensure Wi-Fi services can be managed by
operators as part of their network, including: WBA Next Generation Hotspot, WBA
Roaming and WFA Hotspot.

290
Indoor Wireless Communications
8.11.7.1
WBA Next Generation Hotspot
This initiative is based on the use of roaming via 802.11 u, 802.1× and EAP-SIM
standards. It promises seamless interoperability via WFA certiﬁed hotspots (http://
www.wi-ﬁ.org/for_operators.php). Wi-Fi certiﬁed handsets mean service providers can
be conﬁdent that the devices on their network are going to deliver the very best
experience to their subscribers. The hundreds of phones that have been certiﬁed
work interoperably with thousands of other Wi-Fi certiﬁed networking devices and
consumer electronics. This certiﬁcation is done by the Wi-Fi Alliance.
8.11.7.2
WBA Roaming
This initiative promotes the interconnection between international operators similar to
cellular roaming arrangements via various speciﬁcations, such as WRIX and WISPr 2.0.
8.11.7.3
WFA Hotspot
This initiative somehow mirrors the Next Generation Hotspot (NGH) suggested by the
Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA) and covers the equipment aspects of 802.11 u,
using WPA2-Enterprise and EAP-based authentication.
8.11.7.4
ANDSF
Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) is an entity within an
evolved packet core (EPC) of the system architecture evolution (SAE) for 3GPP
compliant mobile networks. The purpose of the ANDSF is to assist user equipment
(UE) to discover non-3GPP access networks - such as Wi-Fi or WIMAX - that can be
used for data communications in addition to 3GPP access networks (such as HSPA or
LTE) and to provide the UE with rules policing the connection to these networks.
This is a 3GPP speciﬁcation (TS 24.312 and some related information in TS23.402 and
TS 24.302) for Access Network Discovery and Selection. It allows 3GPP equipment to
discover non-3GPP equipment and to follow rules to police and prioritize the connec­
tion between these networks based on operator-set policies.
8.11.7.5
I-WLAN
This is a 3GPP spec allowing carrier managed services over Wi-Fi. It is speciﬁed in 3GPP
TS 23.234. It operates by setting a secure (IPsec) tunnel. However, in a managed Wi-Fi
network this leads to double encryption; that is IPsec and Wi-Fi link-layer security, thus
decreasing battery life.
8.11.8
Discussion
A very interesting perspective for many carriers and mobile operators has been to
reconsider the role of Wi-Fi as a viable strategy to provide a high-speed alternative to
users who may not require full mobility, that is 'nomadic' users, as they consume data on
their mobile device. Wi-Fi ofﬂoad is not only a technically viable strategy but also seems
commercially attractive and sound. As an ofﬂoad technology, Wi-Fi thus brings three
main beneﬁts to operators:
 It is cost effective.
 It is widely available.
 It is widely used.

291
8 Capacity Planning and Dimensioning
Even though a large number of subscribers can access Wi-Fi for free, only a portion of
these actually use Wi-Fi (slightly more than 50%, according to some studies). We must
recall that the data itself is the one to be ofﬂoaded, not the customer! On the other hand,
focus is placed only in data ofﬂoad, but what about voice trafﬁc? Some reports of
frustrations and concrete blocking factors can be found in many Wi-Fi forums that have
made the use of Wi-Fi sometimes more of a pain than a useful service - mainly through
inconsistent user experiences. In summary:
 Client software, which needs to be downloaded to the mobile device. The way it is
executed brings an enormous frustration to users, since it requires long and often hard
conﬁgurations, as well as authenticating to many portals in order to get the service that
is required.
 Discovery, referred to as a great problem for the moble consumer. Issues like
whether the Wi-Fi network they can "see" is a partner of their mobile operator or
not; hotspots whose SSID is reported as 'Public Wi-Fi' and prompt a screen to secure
payment before the service can be used. There is a great deal of confusion on these
aspects.
 Authentication is highly variable - different methods and options are available for
each operator, some of them not working properly; forgotten passwords, etc.
 Service continuity, since some customers sometimes experience poor service, even
though the mobile device is ofﬁcially connected to the Wi-Fi network. Usernames/
passwords, cookies and device IDs are not sufﬁciently secure for many carriers to open
access to premium services such as music or mobile TV - disappointing for
customers!
 Need to liaise with many other players if non-integrated - or build a whole network,
reducing value of Wi-Fi ubiquity in the ﬁrst place.
8.12
Conclusion
Capacity dimensioning and spectrum requirements calculation is an essential part of any
in-building wireless network, especially to determine the necessary spectrum resources
required to provide sufﬁcient QoS for the distinct services and applications that
nowadays wireless networks offer.
We have seen that in past times capacity planning was a very simple exercise of just
allocating enough channels for a certain blocking probability that the system required,
given that the main service was only voice, with very limited data usage. However, in
recent years, this has been reversed and now more data communications demand a
different design approach, in order to guarantee the QoS for each type of service and
application. A careful classiﬁcation of service environments, categories, etc., is manda­
tory for a proper design, and examples of this have been included in Chapter 11 for
further reference.
Finally, the deployment of 5G networks in the near future will require a user to
upgrade this methodology as many more devices (thousands and perhaps millions with
the Internet of Things) will be deployed, with much higher data usage. This needs to be
revised and formulated, but, for now, let us focus on current wireless technologies and let
us have those thoughts for future editions of this book.

RF Equipment and Distribution Systems
When designing an indoor radio system, one of the most important parameters to
consider is to provide enough coverage in the building, as part of the requirements stated
in Chapter 3. This is applicable to UMTS and LTE systems as well, although the design
rules may change. This signal needs to be distributed across the building in the most
suitable, efﬁcient and economical way, ensuring the highest quality-of-service for all
users.
In the early days of cellular radio, coverage inside a building used to be achieved by
placing a macrocellular base station sufﬁciently close to it and downtilting the antennas
to rely on outdoor-to-indoor penetration of the signal. This approach may still be
applicable for small buildings in rural and suburban areas, and this is of course the easiest
way to achieve in-building coverage. However, this method is limited only to buildings
with sufﬁcient LOS conditions with the serving cell, which do not attenuate the signal
excessively. The RF signal is attenuated as it penetrates through the building and is
affected by constructive and destructive rays adding together, or multipath propagation.
Building penetration losses are often sufﬁciently large and thus produce unacceptable
coverage in many areas. As well as providing poor coverage in many situations, this
approach also imposes a further constraint on the amount of channels that can be
allocated to the building - capacity from the external cell is taken to handle the in-
building trafﬁc at the expense of an increase in blocking.
The concept of the use of an internal cell or picocell to provide dedicated coverage and
capacity inside a building is suggested for such demanding buildings, but the choice of
the most suitable way of distributing this power across the building depends on system
requirements and building structure. A comparison of the different types of distribution
systems is made in this chapter and recommendations as to which to choose in different
situations are also made. The costs and performance of the indoor system will depend
critically on making the choice; therefore it is important to have a clear understanding of
this before attempting to optimize any indoor system. Finally, the main characteristics of
the RF equipment and components used in such distribution systems are also discussed.

Base Stations
Base stations are the transmitting element in many indoor wireless networks, such as
cellular, Wi-Fi, DECT, etc. The use of different names vary according to the technology
and some architecture issues; for example for Wi-Fi the name access point is employed,

Figure 9.1 Examples of wireless base stations: (a) cellular eNodeB; (b) Wi-Fi access point; (c) PMR base
station; (d) DECT cordless phone base station.
for DECT the term base is used and for PMR the name infrastructure is often
encountered. Examples of base stations are depicted in Figure 9.1.
A base station can be located inside a building or outdoors, especially for cellular
networks. Sometimes Wi-Fi systems also may have an access point that is mounted on an
exterior wall of a building, especially to provide coverage to a corridor. In cellular, if the
base station is employed outdoors, a suitable housing equipped with power supply and
ventilation is often enough, as well as with the necessary security precautions to avoid
any vandalism on the site. A backhaul network may become an issue in these cases,
especially if the site is located in rural areas with little infrastructure. For indoor base
stations, these requirements are similar but normally the backhaul connection is easier
since the building has sufﬁcient infrastructure to accommodate these needs.
While low levels of RF power are usually considered to have negligible effects on
health, national and local regulations restrict the design of base stations to limit exposure
to electromagnetic ﬁelds. Technical measures to limit exposure include restricting the
radio frequency power emitted by the station, elevating the antenna above ground level,
changes to the antenna pattern and barriers to foot or road trafﬁc. For typical base
stations, signiﬁcant electromagnetic energy is only emitted at the antenna, not along the
length of the antenna tower.
Site acquisition is the procedure that needs to be completed in order to deploy a new
cellular base station at a certain location. For airports, for example, this procedure may

295
9 RF Equipment and Distribution Systems
involve the construction of new facilities to house all the base station equipment
provided with enough ventilation, cooling and power. Also, the site would need to
be properly secured and locked. For Wi-Fi, the base station or access point is much more
reduced in size and therefore its installation does not require a special cabinet or room,
but only an area where power is available and Ethernet backhaul connection can be easily
obtained.
For cellular base stations, technical speciﬁcations may vary according to the standard
(GSM, UMTS, LTE, PCS, etc.), but in general we may summarize the most important as
follows:
 Operating frequencies
 Electromagnetic compatibility requirements
 Electrical safety requirements
 Cooling and ventilation requirements
 Size, weight and dimensions
 Power supply requirements.
9.2
Distributed Antenna Systems
A distributed antenna system (DAS) is a system of indoor antennas throughout the
building connected together via coax or ﬁbre cabling and routed back to a central base
station in the building. This base station is in turn backhauled into the operator's core
network. This base station and the DAS then appears as a distinct cell site on the
operator's network. Depending on the capacity requirements of the network smaller
DASs may be fed by a picocell or repeater rather than a full macrocellar base station.
A very simple way to understand the DAS concept is to see the DAS as a means for
distributing radio signals over a large and complex coverage footprint, as shown in
Figure 9.2. The number of antennas varies from several to hundreds depending on the
size of the coverage area. In essence, it is a system of indoor antennas throughout the
building connected together using coaxial or ﬁbre cabling and routed back to a central
base station in the building, which is in turn backhauled into the operator's core network.
This appears as an extra separate cell site on the operator's network.
Figure 9.2 The distributed antenna system concept.

296
Indoor Wireless Communications
DAS can offer the advantage of a centralized base station installation that segregates
the maintenance of the operator's equipment from that of the DAS. This may be
important where security is a main concern, such as airports, for example.
Distributed antenna systems are normally used for medium to large enterprises for
which the beneﬁts of their use can be easily justiﬁed. If the end-user is not the building
owner they will see the beneﬁts of DAS as an improvement to their existing cellular
service.
In the case of the business or building owner they may have to cover part or all of the
cost of the DAS installation but for major corporate customers the operator is generally
willing to pay all the costs incurred. However, there will inevitably be a lot of disruption
with a DAS installation if appropriate cabling and antennas were not built into the
building from when it was ﬁrst built, and this is rarely the case.
Technically DASs can support multiple operators but this is cheaper to achieve in
passive than active systems. In public venues a multioperator DAS tends to be required
to minimize the requirement to deploy multiple systems. In large corporate DASs,
particularly when installed by the operator, this will be limited to a single operator for
commercial reasons. In fact, there have been cases of DASs being taken out and
completely new systems being installed when corporations have changed operator -
this large investment by operators/corporations can sometimes make changing opera­
tors less attractive on commercial grounds. In Australia, building owners have gone as
far as approaching the government and getting legislation passed to require operators to
keep each other informed of DAS in-building deployments to encourage collaborative
DAS deployments in an effort to try to avoid these situations.
Once installed the indoor service improvements seen by consumers from a DAS will
include:
 Better availability and quality of cellular voice, SMS and data services in the building
 Better cellular data rates
 Improved mobile phone battery life
 Depending on the deployment the DAS may support all operators.
In terms of types of DAS, there are passive, active or hybrid DAS. These are explained
in more detail below.
9.2.1
Passive DAS
Passive DAS is made up of coaxial cables, splitters and couplers. It is normally used for
small to large buildings with a relatively simple layout. It is the preferred DAS option
because of its wideband nature and also because power handling is not normally an issue
as long as the antenna radiated power complies with ICNIRP guidelines on exposure
limits (ICNIRP, 1998). On the other hand, due to the large noise ﬁgure that is added by
passive elements, its use is often restricted to smaller buildings, especially for noise-
limited systems in the uplink, such as in cellular 3G. An example of a passive deployment
is shown in Figure 9.3.
Passive DAS consists of the head-end, an intermediate passive network and remote
antennas. At the head-end, signals from multiple base stations are received and
combined into a single signal. This composite signal is then split via power dividers
into several parallel composite signals that are sent to remote antennas via a passive

network. Passive networks consist of coaxial cables, splitters and power dividers. A block
diagram of a passive DAS is shown in Figure 9.4.
Base stations used in this conﬁguration are usually macrocell base stations with a
transmit power of around 20 W (43 dBm). A high transmit power is needed to overcome
passive losses between BTS and remote antennas, as there are no intermediate RF
ampliﬁers in the network. Coaxial cables used in passive networks are usually ½ or 3/4
inch in diameter; the latter have a lower attenuation per metre, but are more expensive
and more difﬁcult to install as they are bigger and less ﬂexible.
While passive DASs are less expensive to deploy and maintain than active or hybrid
DASs, their major drawback is their uplink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) degradation. Poor
SNR causes a poor uplink data rate, which is a major problem for sporting events, where
uplink trafﬁc often exceeds downlink trafﬁc.
9.2.2
Active DAS
In cases where a building has a complex layout and the space available for the installation
of coaxial cables is limited or difﬁcult to install, an active DAS is used. An active DAS is

normally made of a master unit that interfaces with the base station and distributes the
radio signal to remote ampliﬁers installed near the target coverage areas. The connection
between the master unit and the remote units can be in the form of CAT5/6 cables,
multimode or singlemode optical ﬁbres. Thus, the master unit has the function of
converting the radio signal from the base station into a lower frequency signal or optical
signal, depending on the medium used. The remote ampliﬁer converts the signal back to
the radio signal for radiation. Therefore an active DAS requires careful system dimen­
sioning to ensure that the power handling is within the capabilities of the active elements.
The coverage capability of each antenna can be engineered for the intended service
requirements.
One of the characteristics of an active DAS is that the ampliﬁers balance out any
transmission losses that may occur in the link and also have a much better noise
performance than a passive DAS. They are also very ﬂexible, which means that zoning
and different antenna conﬁgurations are possible with the simple reinstallation of the
remote antenna units. On the other hand, they are much more expensive and complex to
deploy and install than passive components.
In terms of architecture, the active DAS consists of a headend, an intermediate active
network and remote antennas. As is the case with the passive DAS, the headend receives
signals from several BTS and combines them into a single RF signal. On the other hand,
the active network receives the RF signal, converts it to optical, splits the optical signal
into several parallel optical signals and sends them via ﬁbre cables further down the
network. When the optical signal gets in the vicinity of the target coverage area, it is
converted to a digital signal and sent via cable TV (CATV) to digital/RF power
ampliﬁers, which are also known as remote units (RU). At the RU the digital signal
is converted to RF and ampliﬁed. Remote antennas are located next to RUs and
connected to them via short RF jumper cables (0.5-1 m). A block diagram of a typical
active DAS is shown in Figure 9.5.
The maximum distance between RF/optical and optical/digital converters is deter­
mined by an optical link budget. This link budget depends on the type of ﬁbre cable
(multimode versus single mode) and the type of optical connectors used, but its
maximum range is in general of the order of a few kilometres. The maximum distance
between an optical/digital converter and an RU depends on the type of CATV cable used,
as some CATV cable types have less attenuation per metre than others. Typical CATV

choices for active DAS are RG-6, RG-11 and RG-59. The system gain between the
optical/digital converter and an RAU can, to a great extent, cancel out the CATV loss
between the two.
Since remote antennas are very close to power ampliﬁers, the EIRP from the antennas
is fairly uniform, which makes active DAS design and planning easier. On the other hand,
as a power ampliﬁer reampliﬁes the RF signal, the BTS signal need not be as high as it
needs to be for a passive DAS. This is an important aspect, especially for LTE indoor
radio networks.
There are two major disadvantages for an active DAS. First, the cost to deploy an
active DAS and maintain the network is high, especially compared to passive DAS
solutions. The cost to deploy the ﬁrst RU in a DAS is high, while adding subsequent RUs
makes the DAS progressively less expensive. The consequence is that active DAS are
rarely cost effective to deploy in small venues. The second drawback is the power
requirement for RUs, as provisioning AC power at remote locations adds to the total cost
of buildout. In some cases, instead of AC power, RU can get DC power over copper, if
composite ﬁbre/copper cable is deployed. The maximum distance over which DC power
can be effectively sent to an RU depends on the copper wire gauge and RU DC power
requirements. Typical copper wire gauge values are 12, 14, 16 and 18 AWG, while typical
power requirements range from 12 VDC to 75 VDC.
9.2.3
Hybrid DAS
A hybrid DAS is a mixture of passive and active DAS making the best use of the base
station output power. This conﬁguration is normally used for buildings with either
existing passive installations and for which coverage needs to be easily extended or for
areas where it is difﬁcult to have an active DAS, for example due to power requirements,
and therefore passive elements are easier to add to existing active DAS deployments.
These systems, like all DAS installations, require expert detailed design, planning and
installation.
A hybrid DAS consists of the headend, intermediate hybrid network and remote
antennas. As is the case with the previous DAS networks, the headend receives signals
from several BTS and combines them into a single RF signal. The active network
receives the signal and converts it to optical, then splits the optical signal into several
parallel optical signals and sends them via ﬁbre cables further down the network to a
remote unit. At the RU a digital signal is converted to RF, ampliﬁed and split into a few
parallel RF signals using power dividers. These RF signals are sent via coaxial cables to
remote antennas. In some venues, such as tunnels, radiating cables may be used
instead of coaxial cables and remote antennas. An example of a hybrid DAS is shown
Figure 9.6.
The presence of passive elements (coaxial cables, radiating cables) between antennas
and RUs adds attenuation to the output signal from the RU, making EIRPs at the
antennas unequal. However, the elimination of optical/digital conversion makes the
hybrid DAS simpler, with fewer active network elements. It also separates the RU from
the antenna, which allows RUs to be mounted in telecommunication cabinets, further
away from antennas. A typical RU-antenna distance ranges from 10 to 50 metres,
depending on the RF propagation environment.

9.2.4
Installation
The installation of DASs is generally challenging and requires a skilled team to be
designed and installed successfully. Design and installation constraints include:
 Cable routing to stay within maximum bend radius
 Management of intermodulation between carriers in multioperator systems
 Management of handover and interference with neighbouring macrocells
 Restrictions on antenna location due to aesthetic or physical access reasons
 Restrictions on cable routes due to access restrictions.
Installation is extremely costly and therefore this type of solution tends to be used in
high-capacity large buildings only; for example airports, shopping centres, large enter­
prises, or stadiums, whether as active, passive or hybrid deployments. Figure 9.7 shows
an example of a typical DAS installation.
9.3 RF Miscellaneous - Passive
We have spent some time in Chapter 7 discussing relevant characteristics related to
measurement equipment, such as transmitters, receivers, cables, connectors, etc. Most
Figure 9.7 Behind the scenes of a typical DAS installation.

of the principles presented there are also applicable to installed in-building radio
networks, since some of this equipment is utilized here as well, with minor changes.
For example, transmitters in radio measurements are employed to characterize propa­
gation behaviour and estimate coverage in the building, whereas for network installa­
tions they are employed to provide service and coverage; for example in base stations.
The particular characteristics of a transmitter employed for measurements and one used
for base stations certainly differ, but similarities exist in the way both types should be
looked after and maintained. We will focus here more on RF equipment that is often
used for distribution systems, presenting a brief overview of each component. To begin
with, we will focus only on passive networks.
9.3.1
Cables
Coaxial cables are amongst the most popular transmission lines used in distribution
systems, although not the only ones - optical ﬁbre in conjunction with CAT5 cables are
often employed in an active DAS and certainly in Wi-Fi deployments. For passive
installation coaxial is the most popular choice. The parameters that should be carefully
observed when selecting a cable are:
 Cable type and diameter. Bulky cables often have less losses but may represent
difﬁculties when installing them in certain venues. Cable diameters vary, but the

 Losses. Any cable has losses that vary with distance, and these are often quoted for
every 100 m in dB and for various frequency bands. At higher frequencies the
lumped model for a cable (containing resistance, inductance, capacitance and
reactance) changes its characteristics and acts as a low-pass ﬁlter, for which its
cutoff frequency varies with the cable design. Therefore cable losses normally
increase with frequency.
 Bandwidth. Cables operate over a certain frequency range within which their per­
formance is as expected. Beyond this maximum frequency they act as ﬁlters and
should not be used.
 Impedance. As with many other passive elements in an RF network, impedance
should match the rest of the network elements (transmitter, load, etc.) for minimum
reﬂections to occur. For radio systems, the most common impedance is 50 Ω.
 Minimum bending radius. RF cables should not be bent beyond a speciﬁed bending
radius, otherwise they can be damaged and thus produce undesirable reﬂections. Their
radius is speciﬁed in mm and varies depending on the diameter and construction of
the cable.
 Connectors. For radio frequencies, suitable connectors should always be used to avoid
mismatches and reﬂections. This also applies to Wi-Fi cables.
Twisted-pair cables are also used in indoor networks, especially as part of an active
DAS to interconnect remote units with expansion units. One of the most popular ones
used is CAT-5, used also for Ethernet installations.
Finally, a radiating cable is also used as part of a hybrid DAS or a purely passive DAS,
since coverage can be extended in certain areas where it may be difﬁcult to install
antennas. These are the most relevant parameters:

302
Indoor Wireless Communications
 Coupling loss, in dB, also speciﬁed as a percentile and for which a coupling loss
distance is given.
 Longitudinal loss, in dB/100 m, which is very similar to that of coaxial cables. This loss
also varies with frequency.
 Impedance, in ohms, which should be matched with the termination load connected at
the end of the radiating cable as well as with the transmitter.
 Maximum frequency, in MHz, beyond which the radiating cable should not be used.
Recall that radiating cables should be installed not in close proximity to metallic
structures since their radiation characteristics may be greatly affected and undesired
reﬂections may be produced, thus reducing the cable performance.
9.3.2
Splitters/Combiners
Splitters and combiners are often associated together since they perform the inverse
operation: splitters divide the signal coming from a cable in two, three or more
derivations; on the other hand, combiners add many signals coming from many sources
into a single cable. In distributed antenna systems, the use of splitters is very common, as
from the main base station power needs to be distributed accordingly inside the building.
In summary, a splitter that is connected with the outputs as inputs and vice versa is a
combiner. Figure 9.8 shows a commercial two-way splitter and its symbol.
Figure9.3showsanexampleofabuildingforwhichthesignalisbeingdividedtodistributeit
to many areas, as part of a passive DAS installation. An approximate value of 3 dB loss is
associatedwithevery power split.For example,fromEricsson, the KRF 102 246/2 has a 3 dB
coupled loss(two-waysplitter),whereasthe KRF 102246/3hasa4.8 dBcoupled loss(three­
way) and the KRF 102 246/4 has a 6 dB coupled loss (four-way). Note that in addition to this
coupled loss, there isaninsertion loss ofaround 0.1 dBthatneeds tobeconsidered for every
port. If a port is not used, it must be terminated using a dummy load to avoid reﬂections.
A very useful way to calculate the total loss Lsplitter from a splitter (dB) having np ports
and Linsertion insertion loss (dB) is as follows (Tolstrup, 2011):
Lsplitter  10 log np  Linsertion
(9.1)
The ﬁrst term 10 log np
is the so-called coupled loss and is also given in dB.
9.3.3
Antennas
As discussed earlier in Chapter 6, antennas constitute one of the basic and essential
elements for any indoor network, thus requiring special attention. We will avoid giving aPhotograph on the left depicting splitter/combiner and its symbol on the right.
Figure 9.8 Splitter/combiner and its symbol.

303
9 RF Equipment and Distribution Systems
thorough description of the characteristics of these elements - this was done in
Chapter 6. Instead, we will focus on special considerations for in-building installations,
as follows:
 Installation constraints. Antennas need to be installed only at places where their
radiation patterns can be used efﬁciently in order to maximize coverage at designated
spaces. For example, although it may be the best option to choose an omnidirectional
antenna to provide coverage in the middle of a fall, if it is not possible to install ceiling-
mounted antennas then directional panels mounted on walls or pillars need to be
chosen. Antenna size can also be an issue if space is very constrained.
 Aesthetics. Cosmetic requirements restrain the use of indoor antennas that may
visually 'pollute' a space inside a building. On the other hand, these antennas should
be as discrete as possible in appearance so that users do not notice their location.
 Frequency band requirements. Some deployments require multiband antennas, which
should be capable of operating in the designated bands. In general, multiband
antennas are nowadays readily available and allow cost and space savings.
 SISO or MIMO. For modern cellular and other wireless standards, the use of MIMO is
gaining popularity and therefore consideration of this needs to be taken into account.
 Accessibility. For areas where antennas are difﬁcult to install, such as underground
mines or tunnels, radiating cables are used. Special consideration should be taken to
provide adequate maintenance and replacement (if this is the case) to these
elements.
9.3.4
Directional Couplers
Their function is similar to that of splitters, but directional couplers only couple power
ﬂowing in one direction. Power entering the output port is coupled to the isolated port
but not to the coupled port. Figure 9.9 shows an example of a directional coupler and its
symbol. They can be used for separating transmitted and received signals in a system, for
example.
Important parameters for directional couplers are:
 Coupling factor. It takes normally negative values and in practice should not exceed
3 dB since more than this would result in more power output from the coupled port
than that from the transmitted port. This coupling varies with frequency, and the
quality of a directional coupler is often speciﬁed in terms of variations of this lossFigure depicting an example of a directional coupler (left) and its symbol (right).

Note that the coupling loss and coupling factor represent the same thing - Equations
(9.2) and (9.4) yield an identical answer.
For practical directional couplers, the insertion loss consists of a combination of
other losses, named coupling loss, dielectric loss, conductor loss and VSWR loss.
 Isolation. For a directional coupler, isolation is deﬁned as the difference in signal
power levels in decibels between the input and the isolated port when the other ports
are terminated in matched loads. Therefore, for example, for a four-port coupler,
isolation between input ports 1 and port 4 is
p4
I4;1  10 log
dB
(9.5)

Isolation is normally speciﬁed by some manufacturers as the coupler loss (be careful not
to confuse it with the coupling loss). Typical values can vary from a few dB to many tens,
as for the directional coupler from AlanDick, the COU-F0825-50A, which has an
isolation of 50 dB and a maximum insertion loss of only 0.15 dB.
9.3.5
Tappers
A tapper or uneven splitter are used to divide the power from one into two lines, but the
power, unlike the splitter, is not equally divided among the ports. For indoor deploy­
ments, this can be used to tap small portions of the signal from a passive DAS installation
of a very long cable and use this to feed antennas along the cable. Thus there is no need to
install many parallel heavy cables whilst maintaining the losses reduced.
A tapper would be in RF equivalent to a variable resistor in electronics design, since
voltage levels can be adjusted and balanced in a circuit by adjusting the resistance of the
device, while power levels can also be adjusted and balanced in a building. Figure 9.10
shows an example of a tapper.
Tappers normally have a port with high losses and one with low losses. The high-loss
port is often speciﬁed in the tapper by its 'coupler loss', whereas for the low-loss port a
'coupled loss' is reported. For example, for CommScope tappers, such as the 255580, the
coupled loss is around 0.3 dB whereas the coupler loss is 10 dB.

305

9.3.6
Attenuators
For some applications, especially in passive DAS, signal levels need to be reduced and
adjusted to avoid signal spillage in some areas, for which a signal attenuator is often used.
Also, attenuators can be used in an active DAS to reduce high power levels and protect
ampliﬁers from not being overdriven. Figure 9.11 shows an attenuator usually employed
for in-building installations.
As done for resistance in electronics, when a speciﬁc value can be obtained by
connecting resistors in series and/or in parallel, attenuators can be cascaded to obtain
the desired attenuation value. For example, three 10 dB attenuators connected in series
will produce a 30 dB total attenuation.Photograph depicting an attenuator usually employed for in-building installations.

306
Indoor Wireless Communications
9.3.7
Circulators
A circulator is a transmission line or waveguide device that allows energy to pass easily
(i.e. with low attenuation, < 0:5 dB) in the forward direction but offers great opposition
(losses > 20 dB) to signal ﬂow in the reverse direction.
Circulators have been placed in a circular format, as depicted in Figure 9.12. The ports
are arranged so that a signal entering at one port exits at the next. For example, a signal
entering port A is absorbed in matched port B. Similarly, energy entering port B is
absorbed in matched port C. Signal energy from port B cannot go to port A because of
isolator action between these ports. By the same principle, signal entering port C travels
to port D but not port B.
Circulators are used to protect a source or device where the mismatch or VSWR in a
system is very high or where the load may be inadvertently disconnected, as is the case
when an antenna may be accidentally disconnected from a radio transmitter. Figure 9.13
shows the use of a circulator to protect the output of a 900 MHz radio transmitter.
Circulators have an advantage over matching pads or attenuators because they offer
little attenuation to the signal in the conducting direction. However, they suffer from the
disadvantage of being relatively bulky and heavy in coaxial and waveguide form. Newer
technologies have allowed the reduction in size and weight for circulators, which is the
case for the one shown in Figure 9.13.
A common application for circulators is to use it to separate transmit and receive
directions from combined TX/RX ports, but it needs to be used mainly for low power
applications to reduce PIM issues in the circulator.

9.3.8
Terminations/Dummy Loads
Terminators, such as that shown in Figure 9.14, are used as matching loads on a
transmission line or in an open port on any other component (circulators, splitters, etc.)
to avoid reﬂections. They are also known as dummy loads, and radiating cables should
also be terminated using these devices or antennas.Photograph depicting a terminator.

9.3.9
Duplexers
These devices are used to separate a combined transmit/receive signal into separate
lines, for example when the same antenna is being used in the receiver and the two
separate lines are required. The two most relevant parameters to check with duplexers
are insertion loss and maximum power rating.
9.3.10
Diplexers/Triplexers
Duplexers are commonly confused with diplexers, but indeed we are talking about two
different devices. A diplexer combines signals from different bands; for example
900 MHz and 1800 MHz could be combined in a single 900/1800 MHz output coming
out from a diplexer. If three bands are involved, then a triplexer is used.
Note that diplexers/triplexers, as was the case for splitters, can be used in either
direction to combine or separate signals from different frequency bands.
Figure 9.15 shows a triplexer used to combine various signals in TV and satellite
applications.
9.4 RF Miscellaneous - Active
Active devices are widely used nowadays for many indoor wireless deployments. Two of
the most relevant ones are cellular and Wi-Fi, and a brief description of key active
components follows.
9.4.1
Ampliﬁers
Signal ampliﬁcation is often required, especially for large facilities, and therefore special
care should be taken when selecting ampliﬁers for this purpose. In general terms,

309
9 RF Equipment and Distribution Systems
ampliﬁers are employed to extend the coverage in a speciﬁc area without increasing the
capacity of the system.
Bidirectional ampliﬁers are used when a two-way ampliﬁcation is required. A very
common device used to extend the coverage in cellular systems from an outdoor cell
inside a building is known as a repeater. Due to its relevance and importance, Section 9.5
is dedicated to repeaters.
Relevant aspects to check when selecting an ampliﬁer include: gain, noise ﬁgure,
automatic gain control (AGC) availability, operating frequency, gain step size, imped­
ance, maximum output power, compression and intercept points (related to linearity),
size and weight. Remember that ampliﬁers add noise to a system and potentially could
create IMD (intermodulation distortion), which affects the quality of the signal being
ampliﬁed. Also make sure that for the selected frequency band the ampliﬁer is linear -
otherwise distortion will occur at out-of-band frequencies.
9.4.2
Active DAS Components
Active DAS architectures include various elements that convert the signal to/from RF
from/to optical, which will be explored in the following sections. For a deeper analysis of
active DAS, refer to Tolstrup (2011).
9.4.2.1
Main Unit
The main unit is the ﬁrst element in the architecture of an active DAS system and
connects the base station equipment with expansion units, which are the next elements
in the network. These connections are done using coaxial cable, and main units have RF-
to-optical converters as well as A/D converters to transport signals using optical ﬁbre
over long distances (a few km depending on the type of ﬁbre; i.e. multimode or
monomode) and thus minimize losses. This unit generates and controls internal
calibration signals in the system together with internal ampliﬁers, thus adjusting gains
and levels to the different ports to compensate for the variance of internal cable losses
between all the units.
9.4.2.2
Expansion Unit
The next element is the network is the expansion unit. These devices are distributed
throughout the building and are placed in central cable risers. The expansion unit is
connected to the main unit using optical ﬁbre, with separate lines for uplink and
downlink. The expansion unit then converts the optical signal coming from the main
unit into an electrical signal for the remote unit.
9.4.2.3
Remote Unit
The last element in an active DAS is the remote unit, which is installed close to the
antenna in order to keep losses due to cables to a minimum. The remote unit
converts the signal from the expansion unit from an electrical signal to an RF signal
in the downlink and the RF signal from the mobile units into an electrical signal in
the uplink. The remote unit is normally fed with power from the expansion unit in
order to avoid an expensive (or unavailable) local power supply at each antenna
point.

310
Indoor Wireless Communications
9.5 Repeaters
A repeater is a mobile signal ampliﬁcation device or 'booster', which requires an
adequate 'donor' signal from the macrocell network to be present outside the building
to be received, ampliﬁed and retransmitted into the building. Unlike many other
dedicated in-building solutions, repeaters do not require a broadband connection. As
repeaters simply boost the 'donor' mobile signal level they do not add capacity to the
network and as such tend to be used in areas of poor coverage rather than in high trafﬁc
areas.
By using a radio repeater, as shown in Figure 9.16, basically a bidirectional ampliﬁer
with a high-gain and narrow-beam BTS-facing antenna and one or several antennas
serving the mobiles, the geographical coverage can easily be extended into in-building
areas, with the repeater gain overcoming the building penetration loss. The RF signal
received by the repeater can be distributed across the building.
9.5.1
Repeater Deployments
Repeater solutions tend to be deployed in the following three ways: operator deployed
repeaters, traditional consumer repeaters and intelligent repeaters. These are explained
in this section.
9.5.1.1
Operator-Deployed Repeaters
These typically consist of a rooftop or wall-mounted antenna on the outside of the
building to pick up the 'donor' mobile signal from a macrocell. This is then ampliﬁed and
retransmitted into the building, which can either be done wirelessly or over cables to
antennas in the building (which may be a DAS). These systems need skilled installation
and planning to minimize interference to the donor macrocell and with deployments
carefully monitored by operators for interference. Typically an operator will deploy one
of these solutions on request in large buildings for large corporate customers with service
issues as part of their service agreement. Operators also deploy repeaters outside this in
Figure 9.16 RF repeater.

311
9 RF Equipment and Distribution Systems
low trafﬁc areas where coverage is problematic over a small area, such as tunnels and
roads in rural areas. The general view of operators in stakeholder discussions was that
repeaters are only deployed as a last resort and are not a preferred solution.
9.5.1.2
Traditional Consumer Repeaters
These tend to be small, low cost, bidirectional ampliﬁer units that the user can place on
their window ledge to pick up a 'donor' mobile signal, which is then 'boosted' and
retransmitted into the building. In-car repeater units are also available. In the UK these
units can be purchased but are illegal to deploy without permission from the operator,
which is difﬁcult to obtain. This is due to interference concerns to the macrocellular
network, which are much greater in these devices than in operator deployed repeaters as:
 These units tend to be broadband units working across a number of operators.
 The operator has no direct control over where the unit is used and its settings.
 The low cost and small form factor of the unit means that the same level of skilled
installation and setup associated with operator deployed repeaters to minimize
interference cannot be achieved.
Generally the low cost and small form factor of these units means that there is not
good isolation between the two opposite-facing antennas in the unit, which in turn limits
the ampliﬁcation that can be achieved without having feedback issues. This combined
with the placement of the unit on a window ledge rather than having an antenna external
to the building will limit the levels of service improvement achieved.
In the case of consumer deployed repeaters, in the UK at least, while there have been
no direct barriers to vendors producing consumer repeater products, and indeed a range
are available to purchase online, the deployment of these has been limited by the
regulatory rules put in place on the use of such products to protect operators from
interference in their licenced spectrum. These currently require consumers to gain
approval for their repeater product from their operator prior to deployment. This is
generally difﬁcult to obtain as UK operators remain to be convinced that traditional
consumer repeater products will not cause interference to their networks.
In the US the opposite has been true and repeaters have been permitted to be deployed
without speciﬁc permission from operators, leading to their widescale use there.
However, recently the FCC position on repeaters has been revised notably to:
 More tightly specify the functionality and performance of commercial repeaters
 Require all users of repeaters, both legacy users and new users, to register their device
with their operator and gain their approval for its operation.
This move towards tighter speciﬁcation of the technical functionality and perform­
ance of consumer repeaters means that this allows operators to conﬁdentially approve
deployment of particular product ranges. Indeed, in the US all four nationwide carriers
are reported to have consented to the use of consumer repeaters on their networks for
products within the new regulations. However, it is likely that operators will always have
a preference for knowing and controlling where repeaters are deployed.
This tighter regulation may in the short term limit availability of consumer repeaters
to perhaps even just the intelligent repeater solution currently available from Nextivity
but there are no barriers seen on why other vendors could not upgrade existing product
ranges to offer similar features to meet these tighter technical requirements.

312
Indoor Wireless Communications
9.5.1.3
Intelligent Repeaters
These are a recent update to traditional consumer repeater products and consist of two
boxes (i.e. separate donor and mobile units) with integral patchy antennas that are linked
by a 5 GHz radio link (i.e. the same licence exempt band as used by the most recent Wi-Fi
devices). The outdoor 'donor' signal is picked up by the donor box, digitized and
transmitted to the mobile unit via the 5 GHz link and then retransmitted by the mobile
unit. This allows the donor unit to be located near a window and the mobile unit to be
positioned where the coverage improvement is required. This evolution of traditional
consumer repeaters has notably been approved by some network operators and aims to
minimize interference to the macrocellular network by:
 Using intelligent power control
 Having good isolation between the donor and indoor antenna as these are in separate
boxes
 Repeating the signal from within the building rather than on the window, which
isolates the indoor signal from the outdoor macrocellular network better
 Allowing the operator to remain in control of the unit by providing a simple
management feature that allows operators to remotely signal to the intelligent repeater
unit to switch off should the operator observe that the unit is causing interference.
Recently available LTE gateway products can be seen as extensions to intelligent
repeaters. These are ﬁxed consumer premise equipment units (CPEs) that provide a
ﬁxed broadband connection to a home from an outdoor LTE network. However, instead
of providing an LTE signal indoors this broadband connection is distributed via Wi-Fi or
a ﬁxed Ethernet cable, but this limits services available to data services due to the
limitations of Wi-Fi for providing cellular-like services. LTE relays represent the next
evolution of these products and will include the ability to extend the coverage area of
existing LTE cells. However, no LTE relay products are as yet available.
9.5.2
Disadvantages
With the use of repeaters to provide coverage inside a building, various disadvantages are
envisaged. There is a need to ensure sufﬁcient isolation to avoid feedback, as well as for
cases where high gain is required to penetrate a building, as a rise in uplink noise
becomes a problem. Although repeaters extend coverage, they do not increase network
capacity, as they 'steal' the resources from the donor cell to be used indoors. This is a
major limitation, as for dense-populated areas, a sacriﬁce in the capacity of the donor cell
may lead to cell congestion if the resources are not properly allocated. Nevertheless, this
option is still in use for low-cost easy-deployment situations with low-capacity demand
and small coverage areas.
9.5.3
Installation Issues
For operator deployed repeaters, the end-user sees the beneﬁts of improved mobile
service without any action on their part. The building owner is likely to be involved in the
physical installation of the unit and needs to tolerate some disruption while the system is
installed. Disruption will be particularly high if the repeater is feeding into an indoor
distributed antenna system, which requires a series of cables and indoor antennas to be

313
9 RF Equipment and Distribution Systems
installed throughout the building. The erection of the repeater antenna on the rooftop of
the building may also require planning permission and cause additional inconvenience
to the building owner in this way.
In the case of consumer repeaters these are straightforward plug-and-play units that
in theory the user just needs to place on a window ledge and provide power to.
However, installation can be complicated by the fact that the user needs to have a
particular signal level outdoors before the repeater unit will work and, as there is no
standard deﬁnition of a 'bar' of signal on a mobile handset, it can be challenging to
work out if the outdoor signal is good enough and the unit should be working.
Additionally, the move to better thermal insulation in buildings, and in particular the
use of windows with a metallized coating, will make it more difﬁcult for indoor
repeater units to pick up the outdoor 'donor' signal without having an external
antenna added or even the window left open.
For intelligent repeaters the user needs to place the donor unit on a window ledge and
the mobile unit in the area where the service improvement is needed and provide power
to both. Although the 5 GHz link between the two units does not require a clear line of
sight, it cannot tolerate too much obstruction. The patch antenna in the donor unit also
has some degree of directivity, which may require orientation to obtain the highest donor
signal. This optimization process is supported by an indicator on the unit but may mean
that the user needs to try out a few locations before ﬁnding the best setup. The issue of
having a good outdoor signal applies, as discussed for the traditional consumer repeater
case. The intelligent repeater product is also only available for UMTS currently so the
consumer will need a UMTS handset for it to work. Additionally, heavy usage of the
5 GHz link by the repeater units may mean that Wi-Fi access points nearby may no
longer achieve as high data rates as previously.
Distinct from the majority of other in-building solutions, repeater solutions do not
require the user to have a broadband connection. This makes them the only solution for
some niche areas where there is no broadband connection but a reasonably good
outdoor cellular signal that is prevented from entering the building due to the building
construction material or geometry (although an external antenna might be needed if
thermal shielding in the windows is the main problem). As well as rural customers this
may include those who wish to completely substitute their ﬁxed line service with a
mobile wireless service in their home or who may not be able to afford both a mobile
phone and a ﬁxed line service. As mobile service levels improve this is a category of users
that could potentially increase with more consumers viewing mobile services as a
complete substitute option for ﬁxed line services.
Note that the fact that repeaters tend to be deployed in buildings with construction
materials that prevent an outdoor signal reaching all parts of the building does not mean
that the building will necessarily shield the outdoor macrocell network from interference
from the repeater itself. In traditional consumer repeaters the repeater unit tends to be
located on a window ledge and boosts the received signal in all directions, not just into
the building, and so will leak the signal back towards the outdoor cellular network.
Intelligent repeater solutions address this to a certain extent by locating the repeater unit
inside the building rather than close to the outside of the building such as on a window
ledge. However, in both cases the 'donor' outdoor signal is boosted in the building and so
is likely to generate a signal outside the building at a higher level than the existing 'donor'
signal from the outdoor network and hence cause interference issues.

314
Indoor Wireless Communications
Crucially all repeater products must be installed with the approval of operators due to
UK policy on these devices. In the US the deployment of repeaters is much more open,
which leads to them being more widely used.
9.5.4
Beneﬁts
Once installed the indoor service improvements seen by consumers from repeater
solutions will include:
 Better availability and quality of cellular voice, SMS and data services in the building
(although this will be better through an operator deployed solution than the consumer
installed options)
 Better data rates (although nearby Wi-Fi access points may see a reduction in their
maximum data rates when the intelligent repeater is installed)
 Improved mobile phone battery life.
9.6 Conclusion
Network performance can be severely affected by the choice of RF components, thus a
very careful selection is needed. For example, noise rise can degrade the performance of a
cellular 3G system and there are potentially various sources for which noise can be
increased, such as use of large lossy cables, using attenuators in the front end of the UL
and thus contributing more to the overall noise ﬁgure and selecting ampliﬁers with high
noise ﬁgures and relatively low gains. No matter how good we have done the propagation
prediction work or how accurate our trafﬁc demands are to account for capacity, if we
have the wrong elements, performance will be greatly decreased! Remember, it is like a
nice cooking recipe: the instructions and the execution to prepare the dish can be perfect,
but if the ingredients are not the correct ones, we will not get the best taste!

Small Cells
Prof. Simon R. Saunders
Adjunct Professor, Trinity College Dublin
Small cells are not a new concept, but over the last few years they have entered a new phase
of growth and development, with a standards-based ecosystem, greater acceptance by
operators and tens of millions deployed. As a foundational technology for network
densiﬁcation, they are a key element in advanced 4G and eventually 5G mobile technology.
In this chapter we chart the development of small cells, explaining some history and
the technology principles and give an overview of market trends and the business case for
small cells. We explain where small cells ﬁt in the in-building wireless toolkit and explain
how small cells are expected to contribute to the future evolution of the mobile network
topology and to 5G.
This chapter draws on our previous book on femtocells (Saunders et al., 2009) and our
work with Small Cell Forum1 and Real Wireless2 and the interested reader is referred to
those sources for further details.
10.1
What is a Small Cell?
There is no formal deﬁnition of small cells, but they can most easily be explained as any
cell serving mobile trafﬁc which is not a conventional macrocell. The Small Cell Forum
provides the following deﬁnition:
'Small cells' is an umbrella term for operator-controlled, low-powered radio
access nodes, including those that operate in licensed spectrum and unlicensed
carrier-grade Wi-Fi. Small cells typically have a range from 10 meters to several
hundred meters.
Small cells are usually fully ﬂedged sources of both coverage and capacity - essentially
mini base stations. Some people include the whole range of indoor coverage systems

Indoor Wireless Communications
under the small cells banner, such as DAS, repeaters and Wi-Fi, but in this chapter we
will focus solely on devices that autonomously deliver their own capacity and coverage
using mobile standards.
Small cells incorporate signiﬁcant intelligence to support simple incorporation into
the operator network. They support self-optimization with little or no attention by the
operator and with 'zero touch' installation on the part of the end user. Speciﬁc features
vary by manufacturer, but they typically incorporate an ability to monitor the surround­
ing network and adjust themselves to provide good coverage over the desired area while
avoiding interference beyond.
While these processes are conducted autonomously, the small cell remains always
under the control of the network operator via a centralized management system.
Although small cells may be backhauled over the public Internet, they are secured via
mutual authentication between the operator network and the cell, with all communica­
tion taking place over a secure, encrypted IPsec tunnel. The cell reports its location to the
network and is only granted permission to transmit once the network checks it is
authorized to do so, thereby meeting regulatory requirements on spectrum, emergency
calls, etc.
10.2
Small Cell Species
Small cells have evolved to include several 'species'. These are brieﬂy explained in this
section.
10.2.1
Femtocells for Residential Environments
A femtocell will provide good coverage throughout a typical dwelling, with sufﬁcient
data and voice capacity for the needs of the occupants. They typically serve 4-8
simultaneous users and a coverage radius of tens of metres via transmit powers from
a few milliwatts to around 100 millwatts. They are installed by the end user and
backhauled via standard domestic ﬁxed broadband and the Internet, as illustrated in
Figure 10.1. Most femtocells are standalone units to be added to existing broadband
routers, but increasingly operators are integrating femtocells within home routers,
simplifying installation and providing opportunities for QoS management.
10.2.2
Picocells
Picocells or enterprise small cells provide service to ofﬁce buildings and other work
places, or to smaller public buildings. They may serve several ofﬁces or an ofﬁce ﬂoor via
transmit powers up to a few hundred milliwatts. They may be planned and installed by
operator personnel via processes similar to those described in other chapters. However,
their self-managing capabilities open the potential of much simple planning rules similar
to those used for enterprise Wi-Fi systems, allowing IT personnel to deploy them as part
of the enterprise infrastructure and to achieve far greater scale than has been possible
with DAS. Enterprise small cells are backhauled via enterprise-grade broadband
connections, although often these are dedicated rather than shared with existing
enterprise connectivity to assure QoS, especially for voice. Within the building small

317

cells will usually share existing LAN wiring, although usually segmented on a separate
VLAN. Often the small cells in a building will be controlled and managed via a local
controller, although the details of the segmentation of functions between the access
points and controller, and the interfaces between them, are vendor-speciﬁc.
10.2.3
Metrocells
Metrocells or microcells are outdoor small cells, typically mounted on street furniture,
such as lampposts or CCTV poles or else on the sides of buildings at typically 6-12 m
above ground. They provide coverage of a focused area of a few hundred metres in
diameter. They would usually be deployed in an area already covered by macrocells, with
the intention of increasing the local system capacity, improving the user experience of
data speeds and providing coverage deeper into buildings. Metrocells are backhauled
either directly over ﬁbre networks or else via intermediate wireless point-to-point or
point-to-multipoint links.
10.2.4
Rural and Remote Small Cells
Rural and remote small cells (sometimes informally called 'meadow cells') are intended
to provide coverage in areas where user density is too low to be economically served via
macrocells or in special areas such as remote industrial sites or for special events. The

318
Indoor Wireless Communications
technology used is essentially identical to metrocells, although backhaul may be via
satellite links. The distinction is over the deployment model and business case.
In this chapter we will concentrate on indoor small cells, that is picocells and
femtocells.
10.3
The Case for Small Cells
The basic concept of small cells is to deliver coverage and capacity from a location closer
to the user than a conventional macrocell. This produces a number of beneﬁts, which are
brieﬂy described here.
10.3.1
Capacity
By shortening the radio path to the user, interference can be better controlled, allowing
denser reuse and hence higher capacity. This allows operators to support the enormous
growth of demand seen in recent years in a sustainable fashion, even within limited
spectrum resources.
10.3.2
Coverage
By placing cells indoor and in other conﬁned spaces, coverage can be improved in a
focused manner and targeted precisely and hence cost-effectively. Small cells come in
many shapes and sizes, allowing them to be tailored to the needs of a given building.
10.3.3
User Experience
Small cells operate at higher signal-to-noise-plus-interference levels than macrocells and
serve fewer simultaneous customers. As a result, typical data rates can be signiﬁcantly
higher. Since small cells ofﬂoad congested macrocells, these beneﬁts are seen for both
the users on the small cells and for those remaining on the macrocell network.
10.3.4
Cost Effectiveness
By focusing coverage and capacity on exactly the places and users in greatest need,
network investment can be reduced for a given level of investment. Small cells can be
remotely managed, have self-optimizing capabilities and can make use of consumer- and
enterprise-(rather than carrier-)grade backhaul, reducing operational expenditures. In
the case of residential and (to some extent) enterprise femtocells they can be installed by
users and installers without any RF background, reducing the initial capital expenditure
of planning and installation.
10.4
History and Standards
Interestingly enough, the concept of small cells dates back to the last century, where
mobile telephony standards were evolving. GSM picocell products were introduced in

319
10 Small Cells
the mid-1990s and were used to serve some large-scale enterprises and some public
buildings. However, these were largely cut-down macrocell equipment, with little cost
advantage and requiring detailed RF planning, so deployments were sparse and operators
tended to adopt an 'outdoors in always wins' approach.
However, by around 2007 3G had become established and was starting to be used
more extensively for data applications, placing more emphasis on its coverage. Data
applications tend to be used predominantly outdoors and 3G was deployed mainly at
higher frequencies such as the 2.1 GHz band in Europe, so indoor coverage limitations
were more apparent than for GSM.
The concept of femtocells was then introduced, building on several factors:
 The availability of low cost high-speed signal processing chips
 The increasingly widespread availability of domestic ﬁxed broadband at reasonable
data rates
 The take-up of compelling Internet applications
 Increasing adoption of smartphones
 The growth of importance of mobile data revenues for operators.
This combination of factors made small cells in their femtocell guise more practical than
ever before. Vendors collaborated together, under the auspices of Small Cell Forum
(originally known as Femto Forum), to agree technical architectures, management
protocols and deployment best practices, which were subsequently standardized in
partnership with bodies such as 3GPP and Broadband Forum.
In order to drive the adoption of femtocells with a good business case, the price point
of femtocells needed to be at least two orders of magnitude lower than their macrocell
cousins - that is less than around $100 - while supporting similar signal processing
functions and more advanced self-optimizing capabilities. Meeting this challenge
depended on the existence of open, interoperable standards, allowing vendors to
produce a single device type to serve a wide operator audience, and giving operators
an open choice amongst vendors.
Femto Forum drove these standards by gathering operator requirements and
encouraging consistent vendor approaches, especially in terms of network architec­
tures and management protocols. Building on this effort, 3GPP's Release 8 included
a standardized architecture for 3G femtocells, known as Home Node B in 3GPP
terminology. It also laid the foundations for small cells in LTE, including special
features to be supported in the user devices, such as support for closed subscriber
groups, easing the mobility management between the macrocells and small cell
layers.
Therefore, while 3G small cell standards were added some 10 years after the initial
standards, small cell concepts were incorporated in the very ﬁrst release for LTE,
although the details for LTE came in later releases (9 and beyond). Looking forward
to 5G, small cells and other network densiﬁcation techniques are foundational and
essential if the very wide bandwidths available at millimetre waves are to be
exploited.
Small cells have thus become a standard and essential element of the mobile
toolkit, creating a heterogeneous network that can be better matched to the diverse
needs of mobile data users than the inﬂexible macrocell-only architectures of the
past.

10.5
Architecture and Management
The standardized architecture for 3G femtocells is illustrated in Figure 10.2. The
femtocell is referred to in 3GPP speciﬁcations as a home NodeB or HNB. It commu­
nicates over the air interface (Uu) in a way that is entirely consistent with conventional
3G protocols, meaning that no changes to the user equipment (UE) are necessary. The
HNB communicates with the operator core network (CN) over the Internet via the Iuh
interface, where all the trafﬁc is carried securely via an IPsec tunnel, following mutual
authentication between the HNB and a security gateway. The HNB incorporates radio
control functions similar to those undertaken by the radio network controller in
conventional 3G networks, so Iuh is more like the Iu RNC-to-core interface than the
conventional Iub base station-to-RNC interface. It is optimized to avoid unnecessary
signalling trafﬁc over the Internet when the HNB is idle. As well as being standardized,
strenuous efforts in the industry have made this an open interoperable interface,
permitting femtocells from multiple vendors to integrated into one network.3 Iuh
terminates at a specialized gateway (HNB GW) in the operator's core network, which
includes the remaining functions that would be executed by a conventional RNC and
then presents a conventional Iu interface to the operator's core. The femtocells are
managed by a management system (HMS) that uses a standardized management
protocol based on Broadband Forum's TR-069 management protocol, originally devel­
oped for managing home broadband modems and providing scalability to millions of
devices.
Figure 10.3 shows the architecture for LTE small cells. While this is superﬁcially
similar to the 3G case, a signiﬁcant difference is that the LTE small cell (HeNB) uses the
same S1 interface as standard LTE base stations (eNB). The gateway (HNB GW) is
simply a transparent concentrator that aggregates multiple S1 interfaces into a single S1.
It may be omitted in the case of a relatively small deployment, giving the operator a more
economical start-up route. See SCF025 for more details of the LTE architecture options.
These 3G and LTE architectures are applicable to individual femtocells deployed in
the home or in small ofﬁce environments where a single cell per premise is sufﬁcient. In
the case of larger environments, such as ofﬁces or public buildings, multiple cells are
needed for coverage and capacity, and it becomes appropriate to handle interactions
between these locally, including handover processes and local radio optimization. It may
also be useful to integrate the small cells with local enterprise IT and telephony systems.
3 This was supported by "plugtests" conducted by Small Cell Forum and ETSI.

permission of Small Cell Forum.
There is no standardised approach to this, as many different architectures may suit
different buildings and different vendor concepts, but Figure 10.4 illustrates a general
enterprise architecture framework. The local enterprise small cell network (SCN) may
include an enterprise small cell gateway (ESCG), which handles local access to resources
such as the enterprise Intranet and telephony systems and other specialized functions.
An enterprise small cell concentrator (ESCC) aggregates individual small cells together
and can handle local mobility amongst cells, avoiding the load on the core network and
improving performance. Thus an entire enterprise small cell network may present to the
operator's core as if it were a single cell. Management functions may also be split between
the operator management system and the local enterprise, reducing the operational
burden on the operator and giving more ﬂexibility to the local users.
10.6
Coverage, Capacity and Interference
A major technical challenge that femtocell designers initially faced was the need to
manage potential interference. It takes up to two years to install conventional base
stations, during which time radio engineers meticulously plan a station's position and
radio characteristics to avoid interference. However, such an approach is not viable in
the case of femtocells, deployed potentially in their millions at random. Automating a
process conducted by radio engineers was no mean feat and simply would not have been

possible a few years ago. Fortunately, the fact that the walls of buildings keep macrocell
signals out and keep the femtocell signals in provides strong inherent interference
mitigation for indoor femtocells (Figure 10.5).
Extensive studies (SCF003, SCF008 and SCF009) have shown that proper implemen­
tation of a few key techniques to reduce interference can take advantage of this
attenuation in an intelligent manner. Such techniques include frequent monitoring
of the cell's surrounding radio environment combined with adaptive power control.
Indoor users gain faster data rates, as do outdoor users who now operate on less
congested cells, while it costs less for operators to deliver higher overall network
capacity. Large-scale, real-world deployments have demonstrated that these techniques
work in practice and even allow new approaches, such as operating 3G or LTE small cell
networks in the same spectrum as 2G macrocell networks, allowing a spectrum to be
refarmed in a smoother and more rapid fashion.
Additionally, LTE incorporates a suite of intercell interference coordination (ICIC)
features allowing radio resources to be controlled in an integrated manner with
resources in the macrocell network. These have been progressively enhanced including
ICIC (coordination of trafﬁc channels in time and frequency), eICIC (coordination of
trafﬁc and control channels in time, frequency and power) and FeICIC (further
enhancements including advanced receiver cancellation and support for carrier
aggregation).
Once these techniques have been properly applied, reuse of spectrum between macro
and small cells ceases to be a problem and becomes a positive opportunity for improving
capacity, coverage and the user experience. For example, Figure 10.6 shows how the
throughput experience of users is massively enhanced when femtocells are deployed co­
channel with macrocells with appropriate interference management techniques.
Throughput is enhanced by around 100 times for the users on the femtocells and
around 10 times in total including the macrocell users, due to reduced loading on the
macrocells.

Solid and dashed curves are representing 34 macro users per cell, no femtos and 24 femto users and no macro users per cell, respectively.

10.7
Business Case
The business case for small cell deployment differs according to the use case (home/
enterprise/urban/rural) and according to the operator's existing network and motiva­
tions for small cell deployment.
Residential femtocell deployments can enhance coverage for individual subscribers,
reducing the cost of retaining or attracting customers in areas with poor coverage, which
may include both rural areas but also densely populated areas where building penetra­
tion is poor. The cost of deployment is low on a per-customer basis and the costs of
backhaul, power and sometimes the device itself may be borne by the customer. Thus
femtocells can reduce churn, reduce the cost of attracting customers and act as a basis
for cross-selling of additional mobile services and 'quad play' offers including broadband
and TV services (SCF005 and SCF013).
Enterprises can beneﬁt from enterprise-tailored voice capabilities on all mobile
devices as well as a range of secure data services both delivered by the operator and
locally over their own networks. Gaining good mobile coverage is important to enter­
prises: according to one study, 39% of UK IT managers complain of poor in-building
mobile coverage and 35% of managers would switch operators to get better coverage
(YouGov, 2013). The combination of different beneﬁts results in a very attractive
business case. A ﬁnancial analysis of the business case for small cells across six enterprise
environments demonstrates a highly positive business case for both enterprises and
operators (SCF062). As an example, a medium enterprise case study demonstrates an
increase of customer lifetime value (CLV) for the operator of 194% and for the enterprise
of 73%.

324
Indoor Wireless Communications
10.8
Regulation
Broadly speaking, few new regulations are required to introduce small cells, since they ﬁt
under existing spectrum and telecoms regulations with little adaptation. Indeed small
cells can help to meet the typical goals of regulators such as:
 Spectrum efﬁciency. Delivering very dense frequency reuse and consequent spectral
efﬁciency in existing spectrum, small cells make good use of limited spectrum resources.
They can also open up the use of higher frequencies where there may be vacant
spectrum but where it is tricky to use traditional macrocells. They can equally be used at
low frequencies given the use of appropriate interference management techniques.
 Economic efﬁciency. By reducing the cost of delivering services these beneﬁts can
ultimately be passed on to the national economy in terms of beneﬁts generated for
citizens/consumers and producers alike.
 Enabling competition by reducing the barriers to entry for new operators and enabling
more operators to deliver services than would otherwise be possible in a given band. For
example, in 2006 Ofcom in the UK auctioned a small block of 1800MHz spectrum to
12 operators concurrently. Similarly, the US is making a large block of 3.5GHz available
for shared wireless broadband use via a tiered model including both licensed and
unlicensed operation, enabled by small cells (FCC, 2015) and dynamic spectrum access
systems. All of these give the opportunity for greater choice for consumers.
 Broadening access to services, for example in rural areas, avoiding any digital divide
and offering the beneﬁts of mobile broadband to a wider population of private users
and businesses.
Given these positive impacts on regulatory goals, regulators should be motivated to
adjust any regulations that may hinder the deployment of small cells. In 2008 the Radio
Spectrum Committee of the European Union conﬁrmed that, given that small cells
operate as part of the operator's existing network, they can comply with existing technical
licensing conditions and that the proliferation of such cells is supported in the context of
more efﬁcient use of spectrum. Also in 2008, the regulator in Japan simpliﬁed base station
approval regulations to allow femtocells to be deployed by end-users.
One particular area of regulation is in ensuring that small cells can adequately report
their location to support emergency calling and lawful intercept requirements. Several
techniques are available for providing location capabilities to sufﬁcient precision to allow
meet such requirements to be met (SCF036).
Overall, while there have been some regulatory concerns surrounding small cells,
most of these have been studied and found not to be an issue due to the femtocell
remaining under operator control and the strict authentication and security mechanisms
associated with small cells (SCF076).
10.9
Small Cells Compared With Other Indoor Wireless Technologies
10.9.1
Distributed Antenna Systems (DASs)
Femtocells do not overlap with a DAS for home environments, which are far too small
for a DAS to be attractive or practical. In major public buildings, such as airports and

325
10 Small Cells
shopping centres, where very high capacity and multioperator, multitechnology support
is required, the DAS remains a natural choice.
There is a large number of buildings in between these two extremes, however, such as in
ofﬁces and other workplaces, where the DAS has traditionally been too expensive but that
are too large for a single femtocell deployment. In these environments picocells -
enterprise small cells - are emerging as a natural choice and are seeing substantial growth.
By avoiding specialized cable installations in favour of conventional LAN cabling -
potentially even sharing the existing ofﬁce LAN - the installation costs can be reduced
relative to the DAS. Further, the self-optimizing capabilities of small cells reduce the
dependence on specialized RF planning, potentially allowing system integrators more
used to Wi-Fi planning to create the design, although additional design guidelines must
be followed.
In a cost comparison designed to challenge the opportunity for small cells, the total
cost of deploying small cells in some real, relatively large, ofﬁce environments was
compared with the equivalent cost for a DAS in both single- and multioperator cases. In
a 585000 ft2 building upgrading from an existing 3G DAS to LTE for four operators was
39% cheaper via small cells rather than via a traditional DAS approach. In the case of a
new 4G-only system the savings increased to 48%.
Suchsavingsareunlikely tomeanthatsmallcellswillreplacetheDASfortheforeseeable
future, but it is more likely that small cells will allow the large number of buildings where a
DAS is not viable to gain dedicated coverage for the ﬁrst time.
10.9.2
Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is widely available and provides valuable services. While Wi-Fi was not originally
intended for operator-style managed services, lacking security, authentication and
mobility capabilities, several initiatives have sought to address these issues. While these
initiatives have taken much longer to become widely established than was expected,
Wi-Fi is progressively becoming a viable platform for operators, resulting in a new
'carrier Wi-Fi' ecosystem. In some cases, the applications for Wi-Fi create an alternative
to licensed spectrum small cells. Overall, however, there are several reasons for the two
technologies to continue to complement each other:
 In busy areas, cellular technologies can deliver a quality of service that is difﬁcult to
ensure with Wi-Fi, given its intrinsic 'listen before talk' nature (via carrier sense
multiple access and collision avoidance - CSM/CA) and lack of centralized air
interface management.
 Wi-Fi and LTE have different characteristics in terms of coverage and performance
limitations under a high load as illustrated in SCF063. Small cells may provide a
greater range in some cases, delivering an increased beneﬁt per cell relative to the cost.
 Latency-critical services such as voice are also intrinsically well suited to cellular
technologies for the same reason.
 While issues such as authentication and mobility can be addressed in Wi-Fi, there are
several techniques that offer similar capabilities, leading to uneven support for these
across phones, while small cells are uniformly supported by all phones.
 Given the increasing pressures on spectrum, only a combination of Wi-Fi and small
cells allows all of the available spectrum resources to be used.

326
Indoor Wireless Communications
Most operators therefore see cellular small cells and Wi-Fi as complementary rather
than competing technologies, which will often and increasingly be deployed together as
mutually supportive elements of an integrated heterogeneous radio network (SCF089)
and a variety of architectures exist for making the best use of this combination (SCWBA,
2016).
10.9.3
Repeaters and Relay Nodes
Repeaters were historically a common means of improving in-building coverage. They
are essentially bidirectional ampliﬁers and therefore require some existing outdoor
coverage and rely on professional installation to avoid feedback between the incoming
'donor' signal and the outgoing ampliﬁed signal. They are also unmanaged devices,
which are difﬁcult to retrieve and adjust when changes are made to the donor network.
While they are a plausible tool for improving coverage, they use the macrocell capacity
and so do not improve the overall system spectrum efﬁciency signiﬁcantly. Finally, the
cost of repeaters is now often greater than small cells, especially when installation and
retrieval costs are taken into account, so many operators have replaced routine
installation of repeaters with small cells.
However, in some circumstances no backhaul is available that is suitable for deploy­
ment of conventional small cells. In such cases, an emerging alternative is the use of
'relay nodes', which are standardized LTE devices that retransmit data from macrocells
towards local users. They are more than simple repeaters since they actively decode and
remodulate the data, allowing them to operate with weaker donor signals and without
any risk of feedback. They are also an actively managed element of the network, allowing
them to be retuned and optimized along with the rest of the network. They are in a sense
therefore a form of small cell with off-air backhaul and a useful addition to the operator's
options.

Market
While many positive market forecasts for small cells have been made over the years, it is
certainly the case that deployments have been slower than expected. Several reasons can
be identiﬁed for this:
 While the technology of small cells has been well-proven, the approach to deployment
and management has been very new for operators, making it challenging to introduce
them into existing organizational processes.
 The transition from 3G to LTE eased pressures on 3G capacity and caused operators
to wait on mass deployments until their 4G macrocell network was established and
LTE small cells were available at sufﬁciently low prices.
 Existing operators naturally and rationally seek to maximize their use of their existing
investments in macrocells for as long as possible, so they tend to defer small cell
deployments.
 In the case of urban small cells, the complexity of locating suitable sites and backhaul
have made it more challenging than expected to achieve the necessary low costs for a
viable business case.

327
10 Small Cells
 In the case of enterprise small cells, some operators have attempted to deploy them via
traditional DAS system integrator routes, limiting the volumes due to the cost and
slowness of that existing route.
Despite these challenges, small cells are now deployed in large numbers and are
growing strongly. Overall 11.2 million small cells had been shipped as of March 2015,
mainly femtocells (SCF050). Over 77 operators had deployed small cells, including 47 in
the home and 71 in enterprise or public buildings. New deployment approaches and an
increasing tendency for enterprise to self-fund deployments in their own buildings led to
a doubling of enterprise shipments during 2015 and this is expected to be the area with
strongest growth over the course of the next few years. Such growth will require a more
complete 'industrialization' of deployment processes, putting design and installation into
the hands of enterprise suppliers following simpliﬁed guidelines (SCF032) and using
automated management approaches, leaving specialized cellular system integrators to
concentrate on their traditional locations such as large-scale public buildings.
10.11
Future: New Architectures and Towards 5G
As small cells continue to be adopted more widely, the technology is developing to
include a wider range of architectural options, allowing products to be selected to match
the target environments more closely in performance and cost terms. For example, the
trend towards virtualized and centralized RAN, following C-RAN, NFV and SDN
principles is also being applied to small cells with appropriate architectural modiﬁcations
(SCF159). Such architectures typically place greater stress on the quality and cost of the
backhaul (often termed fronthaul in the context of C-RAN) (SCF158).
Anotherdevelopmentistowardsthedeploymentofsmallcellsintheunlicensed/licence­
exempt spectrum as an alternative to Wi-Fi via technologies such as license-assisted access
LTE (LAA-LTE) and LTE-U (SCF097), although the ability for such technologies to co­
exist with Wi-Fi in existing spectrum is controversial (Kwan et al., 2015).
Finally, part of the expected distinction of 5G over LTE is the use of millimetre-wave
spectrum bands where cell ranges are such that all cells are likely to class as small cells
(SCF055).
Overall, it is clear that, over the course of around a decade, small cells have moved
from a minor technology, viewed as a heretical approach by some operators, to an
essential and in some cases dominant element in the evolution of mobile networks. They
now have the potential to ensure a long-term sustainable approach to increasing network
capacity and coverage to meet demand and to deliver these beneﬁts at low cost and with
high availability in even the most challenging locations.

In-Building Case Studies
Dr Vladan Jevremovic
Director of Research and Development, iBwave Solutions, Inc.
Once all the fundamentals of indoor wireless communications have been studied in the
previous chapters, it is time to start practising the design of various in-building radio
systems using practical design scenarios. This chapter aims at integrating theory with
practical considerations that should be made for designing and installing wireless
networks inside buildings, presented as case studies for various types of environments.
11.1
Public Venue
As mobile phones become more affordable, subscriber usage patterns continue to evolve.
The second generation (2G) of mobile telephony primary focus was making voice calls
on the move; third generation (3G) focus was on accessing emails and sending short text
messages while being away from a desk. The fourth generation (4G) focuses on accessing
the Internet on the move in the same fashion as it is accessed from a desk (ﬁxed and
steady location).
While voice users may make a call either on the go or sitting down in a restaurant or
even at home, heavy Internet users are most likely to:
 Engage in Web surﬁng or data downloading while being stationary with nothing else
to do.
 Access the Internet while on a commute to work using public transportation.
 Sit in airport terminals browsing for information.
 Take a break in a food court at shopping malls whilst accessing social networks.
 Check other scores or send videos/photos to friends at halftime during a sporting
event in a stadium.
Everybody seems to be busy with their smart phones, watching videos or checking
status updates. Thus, the use of mobile devices, some of which are broadband, demands
service from operators that could fulﬁl users' needs.

11.1.1
Scenario
Wireless carriersareawarethat user experience is shaped by the ability to accessthe network
inpublicvenuesandareinvestinginpublicvenuenetworkstoaddresscoverageandcapacity.
Most funding is allocated to venues with the highest density of subscribers, such as:
 Airports
 Stadiums and arenas
 Underground public transportation (subways)
 Shopping malls.
While each of those four types has its own design and implementation requirements,
there are plenty of commonalities. As these are public venues, the venue network has to
provide a signal for multiple wireless service providers (WSPs) that operate in the area. In
many cases the venue manager may require that public safety ('ﬁrst responders') and
building operations trunked radio signals are also carried on the network. The 802.11
networks, commonly known as Wi-Fi, became so popular that venue managers insist on
including them as well. These participants in venue networks are commonly referred to
as network tenants.
11.1.2
Solution
In order to provide service to network tenants, a neutral host network capable of
supporting a wide range of wireless technologies and spectrum bands needs to be built at
the venue. The network also needs to be capable of delivering a high power signal to
serving antennas at venues where distance between subscribers and antennas is large,
such as football stadiums.
The best choice for such a network is a Distributed Antenna System (DAS), where
network infrastructure - transmission cables, power ampliﬁers and antennas - are
shared amongst network tenants. The tenants' base station (BTS) sectors are co-located
within the venue and that location is commonly called a base station hotel, as explained
in Chapter 8. At the base station hotel, the RF signal is delivered from a BTS sector to the
DAS head-end. The head-end combines RF signals and transports them via an
intermediate DAS network to remotely located antennas scattered throughout the
venue. There are three types of DAS, which differ by the type of intermediate network
that connects the head-end and remote antennas: passive, active and hybrid, which were
fully described and explained in Chapter 9, Section 9.2.
11.1.3
Common Design Requirements
Whilst each public venue has its own design and implementation requirements, there are
plenty of commonalities that can be found amongst them, which are presented in this section.
11.1.3.1
Multicarrier (Neutral Host)
The three types of networks that are most commonly included in public venues are:
 Commercial mobile networks
 Private mobile networks
 Wi-Fi networks.

333
11 In-Building Case Studies
To make the network less expensive and easier to deploy and maintain, these networks
share hardware components whenever possible. The shared network is commonly
known as the neutral host network. Commercial and private mobile networks usually
have more than one tenant in the neutral host network.
Commercial mobile networks are operated by wireless services providers (WSPs), and
WSPs that operate in the same frequency band often share power ampliﬁers (PAs) in
remote units (RUs). As output power is shared equally amongst all active RF channels in
the band, adding more channels decreases the output power per channel, thus decreas­
ing coverage for all WSPs in the band. To prevent this it is important to include point of
interface (POI) equipment between WSP source and the neutral host network, as the
POI limits the total amount of power given to each WSP. This effectively ensures that the
WSP that adds active channels is the only WSP that is affected by the change.
First responders and venue operations and maintenance operate as private networks.
This network uses two-way radio technology and its design coverage scope is typically
more extensive, as it must cover areas that are not accessible to the general public.
Examples of such areas are delivery docks, electrical and equipment rooms, and areas
that need to be accessed during periodical maintenance of the facility.
With the rise of consumer data usage, Wi-Fi networks became very popular as an
inexpensive alternative to cellular data coverage. The technology is now commonly
included in in-building networks and are often used to ofﬂoad cellular data trafﬁc. Wi-Fi
is a common name for IEEE 802.11 technologies that were developed to provide a
wireless local area network service. Wi-Fi is mostly deployed and operated by the venue,
to improve customer experience and to advertise. Even though Wi-Fi is technically a
tenant in the public venue network, due to transmission constraints it only shares remote
antennas with the other tenants.
11.1.3.2
Multiband
Neutral host networks transmit both licensed and unlicensed bands. The actual number
and type, frequency-division duplex (FDD) or time-division duplex (TDD) of licensed
and unlicensed bands vary by region, as summarized in Table 11.1.

Indoor Wireless Communications
Current worldwide licensed bands range from 700 MHz to 2.6 GHz. While different
regions of the world may use the same name for a spectrum band, frequency of operation
maynotbethesame.Evenmore signiﬁcantisthefactthat somespectra,like4G,areFDDin
North America and TDD in Europe and Asia. It is clear that while the advent of LTE has
helped to streamline mobile technology across the world, it has done nothing to streamline
frequency of operation or the type of licensed spectrum set aside for mobile networks.
The VHF (150 MHz) and UHF (450 MHz) bands are used mostly for two-way radio
communications amongst venue operations and maintenance personnel, and occasionally
for public safety. The SMR (800 MHz) band is used exclusively for public safety. Deploying
the VHF band in public venue neutral host networks is rare and may increase complexity
since it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd quality DAS equipment that includes the 150 MHz band.
The consequence of having to cover a wide range of frequency bands is that an active
DAS may have different values in different frequency bands for gain ﬂatness, maximum
intermodulation distortion (IMD) and the input third-order intercept point (input IP3).
On the other hand, the most common unlicensed bands are two ISM bands: 2.4 GHz
and 5.7 GHz. These bands are shared with other devices such as microwave ovens and
point-to-point links and are used for various Wi-Fi technologies (802.11a, b/g, n, ac), as
was explained in Chapter 2. The increasing congestion in these bands has made
frequency coordination/frequency planning necessary when planning Wi-Fi networks.
11.1.3.3
Multitechnology
Public venue networks carry multiple wireless technologies. Since power ampliﬁer
linearity requirements differ for different technologies, so does maximum output power.
The type and number of technologies vary with region, but the most common across the
world are GSM, UMTS, LTE and Wi-Fi. In North America, CDMA2000 and EvDo are
common, while PHS and AXGP can be found in Asia. Occasionally, WiMAX (802.16e)
can be found throughout the world. The most popular trunked radio systems used by
ﬁrst responders and venue operating personnel are: TETRA, Tait, Motorola iDEN and
Ericsson EDACS. A summary of such technologies found in North America, Europe and
Asia is given in Table 11.2.

11.1.4
Common Best Practices
Whilst each type of public venue has its own speciﬁc best practices, they share some
common best practices as expanded upon in the following paragraphs.
11.1.4.1
Passive Intermodulation (PIM)
Passive intermodulation (PIM) is a phenomenon that occurs in passive devices (cables,
splitters, antennas, etc.) where two or more high power signals mix. As signal amplitude
increases, intermodulation effects become more noticeable. If the spurious signal falls in
the uplink frequency range, it may increase noise level, degrade signal quality and reduce
uplink capacity. Public venue networks are especially vulnerable because many signals
propagate through cables and antennas, and also because some public venues, like
stadiums and arenas, use high-power ampliﬁers.
PIM sources can be external or internal. An external PIM source can be created if
an antenna is located near rusty bolts or rusty mounts, such as air conditioning
ducts (Anritsu, 2014). Internal PIM sources are at the conductor. To locate a PIM
source, a recommended practice is to tap antennas and connectors lightly during PIM
testing to see if a PIM spike occurs. Performing periodic PIM inspections and keeping
antennas and equipment clean is essential for good performance of neutral host
networks.
A bad connector is one with an improper attachment of connector to coaxial cable or a
connector that is corroded. When a bad connector is identiﬁed, it needs to be
disconnected, taken apart and inspected for physical damage or contamination.
When reassembling connectors, care should be taken not to twist them. Small scratches
caused by twisting can generate both VSWR and PIM. All tightening of connectors
should be done using a torque wrench. Inadequate torque will leave gaps, which may
cause PIM; excessive torque may damage the central connector.
Coaxial cables cause PIM if damaged or poorly terminated. If coaxial cables are cut at
installation, care should be taken to clean debris from the cable because debris inside a
connector may create PIM. To properly terminate cables, a connector clamping tool
should be used to set the centre pin depth correctly. It is recommended to use 7/16 DIN
connectors for termination because they are made speciﬁcally to counteract PIM and
therefore are preferred over N-type connectors.
11.1.4.2
Downlink Design
Thermal noise in LTE is referenced to the physical resource block (PRB), which has a
channel width of 180 kHz. Thermal noise referenced to PRB is equivalent to 121 dBm.
If the PIM signal is kept at least 6 dB lower than thermal noise 127 dBm, then the
combined PIM signal and thermal noise is approximately 120 dBm. The difference
between thermal noise and thermal noise combined with PIM is 1 dB, which means that
the presence of PIM increases the noise level by 1 dB. This noise increase is deemed
acceptable, and therefore the goal is to keep PIM at 127 dBm or lower in LTE networks.
In UMTS passive networks the BTS sector transmits at full power, 20 W (43 dBm) per
channel, in order to overcome passive network losses. In those networks, the required PIM
rating of combiners used attheheadend when two 43 dBmcarrier signals areapplied needs
to be 155 dBc (Rogers Canada Webinar, 2013) or 155 dBc (decibels below the input carrier
signal). An acceptable UMTS PIM level is then 43  155  112 dBm.

336
Indoor Wireless Communications
Since the acceptable LTE PIM level 127 dBm is lower than the acceptable UMTS
PIM level 112 dBm, the LTE transmit power per PRB also has to be lower than the
UMTS transmit power per channel. For LTE networks, combiners with 162 dBc rating at
2  35 dBm input power are used at the headend (Rogers Canada Webinar, 2013). These
are able to meet LTE PIM requirements as 35 −162  127 dBm. Note that the
maximum LTE transmit power per PRB (35 dBm) is 8 dB lower than the maximum
UMTS transmit power per channel (43 dBm). Assuming the same antenna EIRP in both
UMTS and LTE passive DAS networks, this means that in LTE networks the maximum
passive network loss is reduced by 8 dB. If the passive network loss is reduced by 8 dB,
the passive LTE DAS will need more sectors than the passive UMTS DAS to cover the
same area.
Unlike in passive DAS, in active and hybrid DAS the BTS sector signal is re-ampliﬁed
in the DAS network before being sent to the remote antennas. For that reason, the BTS
sector signal can be comfortably reduced to lower levels to satisfy LTE PIM requirements
at the headend without impacting the remote antenna coverage radius.
11.1.4.3
Uplink Design
For LTE networks, low latency and high data rates are the key to customer satisfaction.
To achieve high data rates, the SINR has to be high. Figure 11.1 shows the relationship
between the uplink (UL) data rate per physical resource block (PRB) and signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR).
As the PRB is the primary building block in LTE, UL data rates are increased by giving
a subscriber more PRBs to transmit. Although a large number of aggregated PRBs with
low individual data rates may achieve the desired composite uplink data rate, the goal is
to minimize the number of PRBs needed by keeping the signal-to-interference-plus­
noise ratio (SINR) high. In the next two examples, we examine uplink signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) values for comparable neutral passive and active DAS networks. We assume
that the DAS has 16 antennas and is powered by four WSPs, that each WSP has one
sector that has an output power of 35 dBm and that the LTE network operates in a
channel that is 10 MHz wide (50 resource blocks).
The passive DAS architecture is shown in Figure 11.2. It has one 4  4 hybrid
combiner and four 4  1 splitters that have a 6.5vdB insertion loss each, so the combined
Figure 11.1 Uplink LTE data rate per resource block.

Figure 11.2 Passive DAS architecture.
combiner and splitter loss is 13 dB. Passive DAS loss is different for each antenna and, to
calculate the link budget, one DAS antenna needs to be selected to calculate the loss. The
total coaxial cable length from the BTS to the selected antenna is 87 m and, with a cable
loss of 11.5 dB per 100 m, the coaxial cable loss is 10 dB. In the link budget shown in
Table 11.3, the passive DAS loss (combiner + splitter + coaxial cable) for the selected
antenna is 23 dB.
In the uplink, the noise per channel at the remote antenna is at the thermal noise level.
It does not change from antenna to RF source because the DAS is passive and cannot
generate noise by itself. Therefore, the noise level at the DAS antenna input and at the
BTS sector input are the same. However, the UE signal does change because the passive
DAS attenuates the signal as it passes from the DAS antenna to the BTS sector. The
amount of signal attenuation is equal to the difference between the DAS antenna gain
(3 dBi) and the passive loss (23 dB), which is 20 dB. This signal attenuation also reduces
the uplink SNR by 20 dB, as the uplink SNR drops from 28.1 dB at the input of the DAS
antenna to 8 dB at the BTS sector input. From Figure 11.1, we see that SNR = 8 dB gives a
data rate per RB of 200 kHz.
For the hybrid DAS, we use a high-power Andrew ION
TM-B active DAS. Four remote
units are used, each of which has a single output port that connects to a four-way splitter.
Each splitter output connects to an antenna using coaxial cable. The hybrid DAS is
shown in Figure 11.3.
The composite transmit power of the remote units is speciﬁed for each spectrum band
and is shared amongst all WSPs that transmit in that band. The power per RF channel
depends on the number of RF channels in the band. Composite RF power per remote
unit (30 dBm) is divided equally amongst six RF channels, giving a transmit power per

11 In-Building Case Studies
Unlike a passive DAS, a hybrid DAS generates uplink noise through uplink ampliﬁers. In
this example, four remote ampliﬁers (remote units) generate a composite NF of 13dB at a
ﬁbreh. This composite NF and the ampliﬁer gain increase the noise per channel from the
thermal level 104 dBm to 76 dBm. However, splitters, ﬁlters and cable jumpers insert a
13 dB loss in the uplink, thereby reducing the noise level to 89 dBm at the base station
input. While UL noise increases 15 dB, the UL signal traversing the same path gains only
2 dB, so the SNR drops 13dB from 20.8 dB at the RU input to 7.8dB at the base station input.
If we compare the hybrid DAS UL SNR with the passive DAS UL SNR we may
conclude that the two have a similar performance, as their UL SNR is almost the same.
However, in this passive DAS example, the distance from the antenna to the BTS is 87 m
and extending this distance further would reduce downlink antenna coverage. In the
hybrid DAS, it is the distance between the antenna and the RU that limits downlink
antenna coverage. The RU may be placed up to a few km away from the optical/RF
converter, which is usually collocated with the base station at the headend. Therefore,
the hybrid DAS can reach areas that are further from the base station than can the
passive DAS, which gives hybrid DAS more deployment ﬂexibility with the same uplink
performance. The active DAS UL SNR calculation, omitted for the sake of brevity, is very
similar to that for the hybrid DAS, the only major difference being that the active DAS
does not use coaxial cables, only jumper cables.
11.1.5
Summary
Although public venues vary in size and RF morphology, neutral host networks that
provide coverage at those venues share some common design requirements and best
practices. Within the neutral host network, PIM generation is an important concern as
poor installation or poor choice of antenna location can generate PIM that otherwise
cannot be detected through RF design. LTE networks are most sensitive because they
require very low PIM levels to operate properly. BTS sectors that feed a passive DAS
need to transmit at lower than usual power levels to satisfy LTE PIM requirements,
which increases the number of antennas and sectors in a passive DAS. While passive and
active DASs may have comparable uplink data rates, passive DAS antennas need to
be closer to the headend to maintain downlink coverage. The passive DAS needs double
resources (coaxial cables, splitters) for LTE MIMO. All these factors imply that
the passive DAS is not a good choice if an LTE network is to be included in a public
venue neutral host network.
11.2
Stadium
As discussed in Chapter 2, a stadium is a venue that consists of a ﬁeld/track surrounded
by a bowl-shaped seating area. The largest stadium in the world is in Pyongyang, North
Korea, with a capacity of 150 000 spectators. The second biggest is in Kolkata, India, with
120 000 spectators. There are only a handful of stadiums with more than 100 000 seats.
As of 2015, 934 stadiums worldwide have 30 000 or more seats: 228 in North America;
129 in Central and South America; 243 in Europe; 98 in the Middle East and Africa and
236 in the Asia-Paciﬁc region. The USA alone has 217 stadiums with 30 000 seats or
more and about two-thirds of these are used primarily for American Football. See
Figure 11.4 for a worldwide high-capacity stadium breakdown.

342
Indoor Wireless Communications
Figure 11.4 Worldwide high-capacity stadium breakdown.
Although the size and conﬁguration of stadiums vary widely, there are design and
deployment considerations common to all stadiums, which are discussed in this section.
11.2.1
Scenario
The case study venue has a capacity of 60 000 seats with ﬁve different seating levels, as
shown in Figure 11.5. General public retail shops and concession stands are located on
the ﬁrst level, between the stadium entrance and the entry points to the seating bowl.
On the same level, but not accessible to the general public, are conference rooms. One
level below is ground level where the press rooms and team dressing rooms are
located.Figure depicting stadium seating plan in 2-D.

Figure 11.6 Typical call blocking statistics on the day of a stadium event.
The existing RF coverage coming from surrounding macro sites is fair to good in the
bowl, but poor below it, in back ofﬁces, in conference rooms and in concession areas.
The macro sites that cover the stadium report high call blocking during venue events, as
illustrated in Figure 11.6. For this example, note that a blocking peak of 60% is reported
in the busy-hour peak; i.e. during the event.
The call blocking problem is not restricted only to the stadium building, but also
occurs in surrounding areas where spectators congregate before and after events. These
transit areas include car parks, train stations, pedestrian footpaths (above or below
ground), etc. Examples of such transit areas are shown in Figure 11.7.
Figure  dep icting the  bir d' s-eye v iew o f trans it areas outside the stadium.

344
Indoor Wireless Communications
The stadium network needs to provide coverage and capacity both to the stadium and to
nearby transit areas. The network should be able to support trafﬁc when the stadium is at
full capacity during an event and also the trafﬁc near the venue before and after the event.
11.2.2
Solution
Although there is some residual macro RF coverage in the seating area, the main
problem is the lack of capacity from the surrounding macro sites. The stadium therefore
needs its own RF network to satisfy demand during events. All commercial wireless
service providers (WSPs) want to be included in the stadium network. The network must
also include public safety and the venue operations trunked radios. An IEEE 802.11
(Wi-Fi) network needs to be included as well.
In order to provide service to multiple commercial and non-commercial carriers, a
neutral-host mobile network needs to be built at the stadium. The best choice for such a
network is a distributed antenna system (DAS), one in which ﬁbre, power ampliﬁers,
coaxial cables and antennas are shared amongst the network tenants. The DAS is also
capable of providing a high power signal to the serving antennas, critical at large venues
where the distances between subscribers and antennas are large.
Although transit areas outside the stadium have good coverage, they suffer from
inadequate capacity before and after events. The DAS therefore has to be extended to
those areas as well. The DAS signal has to be slightly stronger than the residual macro
signal to guarantee that subscribers connect to the stadium network rather than to the
surrounding macro network.
11.2.3
Design Requirements
The design requirements for this 60000-seat venue are as follows.
11.2.3.1
RF Coverage
 The stadium network signal must be dominant throughout the venue, even if there are
areas where the existing macro coverage gives a 'ﬁve-bar' reading on a phone.
 To achieve this dominant signal requirement, the RF design should provide a signal
that is everywhere 5 to 7 dB stronger than the residual macro signal. This requirement
applies to the nearby transit areas as well (see Figure 11.7, above).
11.2.3.2
Capacity
 The stadium network should be designed to address all service types, from voice to
streaming video.
 The pattern of voice and data calls may be different at the stadium than at typical
macro networks: voice calls may be shorter due to stadium crowd noise, there may be
far more ﬁle uploads to social media than usual and some venues may limit streaming
video or, as was the case at the 2014 Super Bowl, ban it completely.
11.2.3.3
Handoff Management
 Establish clear handoff areas between the macro network and the stadium network in
the transit areas outside the stadium.

345
11 In-Building Case Studies
 Once a subscriber hands off from the macro network, he should remain with the
stadium network throughout the duration of his visit to the venue.
 Handoff trafﬁc is handled by control channels. Extensive handoff trafﬁc may use up
control channel capacity and result in call blocking, even if sufﬁcient physical
resources are available to carry voice and data trafﬁc.
11.2.3.4
Interference Management
 Non-serving sectors are a source of interfering signal. Interference can be internal,
from non-serving DAS sectors, and external, from the macro network.
 Minimizing interference improves both network capacity and maximum achievable
data rate (MADR).
11.2.4
Site Survey
When designing a network, certain rules need to be followed to achieve an optimum
design, as speciﬁed in Chapter 7. One of these is related to the gathering of information
for the site survey.
During the initial site visit, information about the physical structure, architecture and
the different morphologies within the venue is gathered. A lot of information is captured
in the form of photos, videos, measurements from data collection tools, voice memos
and text annotation. Potential locations for antennas, cable runs and install equipment
are also scouted.
During the survey the existing macro radio coverage at the venue should be recorded
for all wireless carriers that are to be included in the network and at all frequency bands
of interest. This is an important part of the survey because the actual stadium network
has to overcome the residual macro coverage by a comfortable margin. Otherwise,
spectators' user equipment (UE) may be registered with the macro network while at the
venue, a highly undesirable situation because an important requirement is to ofﬂoad the
macro networks. Figure 11.8 shows a ﬁeld engineer collecting RF and other venue data.Photograph depicting site survey engineer collecting RF and other venue data.

Figure 11.9 (a) General area of an antenna location; (b) an arrow marks the location; (c) a pushpin
indicates the location on a site layout.
During the site survey, in addition to RF data, the engineer needs to identify spots
where antennas may be mounted, to identify a room large enough to house the headend
for the in-building network and to identify potential cable paths between the headend
and the antennas.
Recording the information directly on to a ﬂoor plan saves time and facilitates
information exchange with other departments and stakeholders. Plenty of information
is captured and making sense of it is of crucial importance to reducing deployment
timelines and costs. It is also important to identify several locations at which to mount
candidate antennas so that different alternatives to control radio signals and provide
capacity can be considered during the detailed RF coverage design phase later on.
Figure 11.9 shows an example of data collected by an engineer during a site survey.
Figure 11.9(a) is a photograph of a general area of a potential antenna location in the
seating area. Figure 11.9(b) zooms in on the location, marked with an arrow. The
location needs to be identiﬁed on a layout plan as well so that the RF design engineers can
know where they can put DAS antennas. This is illustrated by Figure 11.9(c), which
shows the venue layout displayed on a tablet; a pushpin indicates the antenna location.
11.2.5
Detailed 3-D Modelling
Stadiums are multilevel structures that contain a wide variety of RF propagation
environments. The most signiﬁcant is the seating bowl, which is modelled as an inclined
surface so as to take into account the difference in elevation between rows of seats. UE in
this area will have a clear LOS to the serving antennas, positioned above the seats. An
example of a 3-D model of a seating bowl is shown in Figure 11.10.
Capacity hotspots outside the bowl area need to be included in the design. Corporate
and news media boxes, retail shops and concession stands are examples of capacity
hotspots. Capacity hotspots that are not accessible to the general public such as
conference rooms, press rooms, and team locker rooms also need to be included.
Capacity hotspot examples are shown in Figure 11.11.
These areas are generally well isolated from the seating bowl so they need their own
antennas for coverage. RF propagation characteristics in stadium hotspots vary consid­
erably. Inside the bowl, a signal from the DAS is clearly in LOS with UE. Underneath the

bowl, in the retail area, LOS is prevalent but there are numerous reﬂected signals due to
the bowl's concrete walls. In the back-of-the-house areas, where the conference and
locker rooms are located, wall density is much higher so there is signiﬁcant signal
diffraction and non-line-of-site (NLOS) propagation.
As propagation characteristics at hotspots differ from those in the seating area, it is
necessary to properly model the hotspots in 3-D as well. Figure 11.12 shows the retail
area immediately below the seating area.
Making a 3-D model of a venue can take anywhere from ﬁve hours for smaller venues
to twenty hours for larger, more complex venues. Availability of the drawings in
electronic form (CAD), rather than in the form of paper drawings, also affects the
time to complete the 3-D model. Often a system is designed for a building under
construction; hence there is the need to work using a 3-D model as no access is available

to the venue. Proper modelling of the venue is important not only for propagation
analysis but also for good bill of materials estimates, such as for lengths of coax or ﬁbre.
11.2.6
Sectorization
Sectorization has a dual purpose in the design of a radio network. First and foremost, it
increases network capacity because each sector has its own channel cards capable of
carrying voice and data trafﬁc. Sectors are assigned a speciﬁc area to cover and serve a
speciﬁc number of subscribers. The actual area to be covered and the actual number of
subscribers that a sector should serve are a part of capacity sizing, where parameters such
as the number of channels per sector, data rates, and the type and duration of calls and
data connections are taken into account.
The second purpose of sectorization is to minimize the number of signals present in the
area by limiting sector coverage. Limiting the coverage also limits interference from non-
serving sectors, which improves capacity, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) and the maximum achievable data rate (MADR). In LOS areas like the seating
bowl, sector overlap minimization is achieved by using highly directional antennas.
There are a few common sectorization types. Horizontal (ring) or vertical (wedge)
sectorization is used most commonly where the number of sectors is not very high.
Examples of such sectorization schemes are shown in Figure 11.13. The advantage ofFigure depicting the examples of (a) ring and (b) wedge stadium sectorization.

these methods is that horizontal or vertical movements by spectators do not result in
extensive UE handover.
If, however, a signiﬁcant number of sectors is required, then hybrid ring-and-wedge
sectorization is the best option. An example of mixed sectorization with 24 sectors is
shown in Figure 11.14.
11.2.7
Macro Coverage Management
Early on in macro network deployments, WSPs recognized the revenue potential of
venues with high subscriber density, such as stadiums. At ﬁrst they tried to provide good
stadium coverage by pointing sectors of nearby macro sites towards the venue. However,
as networks became more data-centric, the data trafﬁc became more congested and
capacity at the venue became the primary concern. Nowadays many stadiums have good
coverage in the seating bowl, but need a dedicated stadium network to direct the trafﬁc
away from the neighbouring cell sites that would otherwise be overloaded during
stadium events.
When designing stadium network coverage, a common practice is to design so that the
DAS signal will be stronger than the residual macro signal by at least 5 to 7 dB. If the
residual macro signal is already strong, a DAS may need many antennas to achieve this
goal, which may make the cost of deploying the DAS prohibitive. The most effective way
to reduce the residual macro coverage is to downtilt antennas at nearby sectors that
point towards the venue, as shown in Figure 11.15.
The upper line in Figure 11.15 shows the RF signal path with the initial antenna
downtilt. The signal is diffracted from the stadium roof, which causes little attenua­
tion, thus providing a strong signal in the bowl. When the sector is downtilted further,
the signal path shown in the lower line penetrates the concrete wall. This is often
preferable because the concrete wall signiﬁcantly attenuates the signal before it
reaches the bowl.

11.2.8
Passive Intermodulation Management
Neutral-host networks with high transmit power are susceptible to passive inter-
modulation (PIM) noise generation. If the PIM noise level is sufﬁciently high, it can
reduce coverage, slow the network, cause dropped calls and reduce battery life. LTE
networks are especially susceptible to PIM noise because SINR is referenced to the
resource block, which is 180 kHz wide. Thermal noise referenced to 180 kHz is
121 dBm and, for an LTE network to function properly, maximum PIM noise must
be 127 dBm or lower. To ensure that PIM noise is kept in check, the following steps
should be undertaken during the design stage:
 Combiners

 Braided coaxial cables and N-type connectors are a known source of PIM noise and
should not be used.
 Silver-plated 7/16 DIN connectors should be used as they have a low PIM rating
(165 dBc).
 Consider only antenna locations that are away from metal objects, as metal near
antennas generates PIM.
 Do not use equipment for which the manufacturer does not specify a PIM rating.
 Perform on-site PIM testing prior to antenna installation, using an antenna on a pole.
11.2.9
Design for Stadium Capacity
In order to properly size stadium networks it is necessary to determine the number of
sectors required to support each carrier's capacity requirements. The number of sectors
per carrier depends on the number of seats, the carrier's subscriber penetration rate (i.e.
the percentage of that carrier's subscribers as a proportion of the general population) and
the carrier's mobile trafﬁc proﬁle. For this case study, the stadium has 60 000 seats
and the stadium network needs to carry three WSPs, public safety, stadium operations
network and Wi-Fi. The characteristics of the three WSPs are as follows:
WSP A:
- Cellular band (850 MHz), 2 UMTS channels
- AWS band (2100 MHz), 2 UMTS channels

351
11 In-Building Case Studies
- 700 MHz band (700 MHz), 10 MHz LTE-FDD channel
- 40% subscriber penetration rate.
WSP B:
- PCS band (1900 MHz), 2 UMTS channels
- 2.5 GHz band, 10 MHz LTE-TDD channel
- 10% subscriber penetration rate.
WSP C:
- AWS band (1900 MHz), 2 UMTS channels
- PCS band, 5 MHz LTE-FDD channel
- 20% subscriber penetration rate.
Let us deﬁne HSPA and LTE trafﬁc distribution per user at the stadium as shown in
Table 11.5, which lists, for each service type, the duration of the network connection
during the busy-hour expressed in millierlangs (mE) per subscriber, the ﬁxed data rate in
kbps and the probability, expressed as a percentage, that a subscriber is using, or will
attempt to use, that service type during the busy-hour. It is important to note that a
subscriber is not limited to one service type attempt per busy-hour; rather he may use, or
attempt to use, any or all of the service types listed.
The probability of video streaming or video conferencing is low because it is assumed
that they are very rarely used at the venue; most of the trafﬁc at the venue is Internet
browsing and data downloading, with some email. It is further assumed that half the
subscribers use HSPA and the other half use LTE, reasonable assumptions for practical
stadium scenarios. Thus:
 WSP A: 60 000  40%  24 000 customers
 WSP B: 60 000  10%  6000 customers
 WSP C: 60 000  20%  12 000 customers
It is assumed that voice trafﬁc is carried over the WCDMA (R99) protocol, while 3G
and 4G data are carried over HSPA and LTE protocols, respectively. When deﬁning the
subscriber proﬁle for R99, we take into account that data trafﬁc would switch to R99 data
only if both HSPA and LTE are unavailable. Therefore, the probability of an R99 data call
is very low, which is reﬂected in the R99 trafﬁc distribution shown in Table 11.6.
For HSPA and LTE, SINR coverage in the seating area is calculated and broken down
into SINR intervals based on the modulation scheme that can be achieved in each SINR
interval. The example in Table 11.7 shows that, in a region where LTE PDSCH SINR is

20 dB or more, 64-QAM modulation with the coding rate R = 0.93 is possible and gives a
spectral efﬁciency of 5.5 bit/s/Hz. With SINR between 15 and 20 dB, spectral efﬁciency is
3.9 bit/s/Hz; with SINR between 9 and 15 dB, the efﬁciency is 2.4 bit/s/Hz, etc.
By knowing the relationship between the signal modulation scheme, spectral efﬁ­
ciency and SINR, the number of resources needed to support each service type listed in
Table 11.5 may be calculated. These 'resources' are different for different technologies:
LTE resources are physical sesource blocks (PRBs), UMTS resources are HSPA
orthogonal codes, etc. As spectral efﬁciency varies with SINR, so does the number of
resources needed to support a certain service type in each SINR zone. For example, if
SINR is high, a single PRB may be sufﬁcient to support email but if SINR is low, more
than one PRB may be required.
11.2.9.1
Data Capacity Sizing
For LTE capacity dimensioning, a downlink LTE SINR coverage map must be calculated.
As the sector overlap affects the SINR, an assumption must be made about the number of
sectors in the network. Table 11.8 shows how to estimate the number of sectors based on
the user proﬁle, estimated the MADR coverage, and estimated the call blocking rate.
The MADR coverage breakdown assumption is driven by high density sectorization,
which is quite common at stadiums. The highest data rates are only possible near
antennas and thus the 58.3 Mb/s data rate gets only 20% coverage. The lowest data rates
(8.8 Mb/s) are where sectors overlap, and estimating 30% of the stadium to be in sector
overlap is reasonable. The other two MADR rates are equally split, with 25% coverage
each.

A general rule of thumb for the call blocking rate is that the higher data rate services
have a higher blocking rate and that the call blocking ratio of two service types is the
same order of magnitude as their data rate ratio. For example, if we assume that the
average call blocking for video streaming (2 Mb/s) is 20%, then call blocking for the data
download (1 Mb/s) should be about 10%.
With these two sets of assumptions we calculate 24 LTE sectors at the stadium.
Propagation analysis with 24 sectors has produced an SINR coverage map of the stadium
bowl that can be split into four SINR ranges, as shown in Figure 11.16. Each SINR range
has a speciﬁc modulation scheme with a speciﬁc spectral efﬁciency value, as seen in
Table 11.8. The dependence of spectral efﬁciency on SINR is important because spectral
efﬁciency ultimately determines the maximum achievable data rate (MADR) for each
SINR range.
As we see from Figure 11.16, the LTE SINR Range 1 (3  SINR  9) covers 30% of the
area, the SINR Range 2 (9  SINR  15) covers 25% of the area, the SINR Range 3
(15  SINR  20) covers 25% of the area and the SINR Range 4 (SINR > 20) covers 20%
of the area. Assuming a uniform distribution of spectators, the percentage of LTE users
within a particular SINR range is the same as the SINR coverage percentage for that
range. For the sake of brevity, repeating this exercise with HSPA SINR is omitted;
calculating the HSPA SINR distribution yields 50% 3G users in the SINR HSPA Range 1,
30% in Range 2, 15% in Range 3 and 5% in Range 4.

Figure 11.16 LTE PDSCH SINR coverage used for the data sizing example.
Let us assume that there are 1000 subscribers in a sector (which is the case for WSP A)
and that they are split equally between HSPA and LTE. We then calculate HSPA and
LTE busy-hour trafﬁc (in erlangs) based on the number of subscribers in each SINR
range and busy-hour trafﬁc per subscriber, as given in Table 11.5. The results are shown
in Table 11.9.
The number of resources needed to support the service types across the ranges is
calculated next. This is readily determined if the relationship between SINR versus
spectral efﬁciency is known, which can be taken either from research papers or directly
from vendors. Table 11.10 shows, for this example, the distribution of resources by the
SINR range for HSPA and LTE networks for WSP A.
Based on Tables 11.9 and 11.10, and given the total number of HSPA and LTE
resources in a sector, the blocking probability for each service type may be calculated.
The blocking rate is deﬁned as the percentage of attempted network connections that are
denied due to insufﬁcient network resources. The blocking rate formula for multiple
services used for this calculation is taken from ITU (2013). The resultant blocking rates
for HSPA and LTE technologies, by service type and by SINR range, are as shown in
Table 11.11.
Table 11.11 is the key for sizing the network because it shows the blocking rate for
each service type throughout the seating area (SINR ranges 1 to 4). From Table 11.11 we
see that 27.3% of the attempts to stream video using LTE from the area where LTE SINR
exceeds 20 dB (Range 4) are blocked due to insufﬁcient LTE resources. In contrast, only
0.2% of attempts to stream video from Range 4 areas are blocked due to insufﬁcient
HSPA resources. While the blocking rates in areas where SINR is very good are clearly
much higher for the LTE network, it should be noted that WSP A has four UMTS
channels, which is equivalent to 20 MHz of spectrum. On the other hand, the LTE
channel is only 10 MHz wide.

If the calculated blocking rates shown in Table 11.11 are not acceptable, the number of
sectors should be increased in order to reduce the number of subscribers per sector, the
SINR map recalculated and the capacity calculations repeated. This is an iterative
process that is continued until acceptable blocking rates are found.
Carried busy-hour trafﬁc is calculated based on offered trafﬁc (Table 11.9) and
blocking rate (Table 11.11) for each service type. Results are shown in Table 11.12.

To determine offered busy-hour trafﬁc, the entries in Table 11.9 are summed for LTE
and HSPA. Offered trafﬁc is 19 erlangs for both HSPA and LTE. Similarly, to determine
carried busy-hour trafﬁc, the entries in Table 11.12 are summed for LTE and HSPA.
Carried HSPA trafﬁc is 18.05 erlangs and carried LTE trafﬁc 18.26 erlangs. The
composite call blocking rate (BR) is calculated as
Carried traffic
BR  1 
(11.1)
Offered traffic
This yields blocking rates of 5% for HSPA and 3.9% for LTE. While both technologies
have similar statistics, it should be noted that UMTS has four channels (20 MHz of
spectrum) while the LTE channel is only 10 MHz wide.
Duty cycle is deﬁned as the ratio of carried trafﬁc to theoretical maximum trafﬁc when
all resources are used for the busy-hour. It is 6% for HSPA and 4.1% for LTE. HSPA data
usage is 4.42 gigabytes in a busy-hour, while LTE data usage is 4.51 gigabytes. Since WSP
A has 24 000 subscribers, the trafﬁc and data usage numbers need to be multiplied by 24
to get the total WSP A trafﬁc for the whole stadium.
Similar calculations can be done for WSP B and WSP C. WSP C has half the number of
subscribers, but also half as many UMTS channels and half the LTE bandwidth, and
therefore needs 12 sectors. WSP B has half the subscribers that WSP C has but, under the
assumption that the 10 MHz LTE TDD channel is conﬁgured symmetrically in uplink
and downlink, has the same LTE capacity. Under that assumption, WSP B needs half the
sectors, but with a lower blocking rate, lower data trafﬁc in erlangs and lower data usage
in gigabytes than WSP C. The ﬁnal sector breakdown, based on data trafﬁc sizing only, is
as follows:
• WSP A: 24 sectors
• WSP B: 6 sectors
• WSP C: 12 sectors
11.2.9.2
Voice Capacity Sizing
Voice capacity is sized through the WCDMA portion of the UMTS signal. As was done
for data capacity calculations, Eb=N0 coverage needs ﬁrst to be determined, then
separate the coverage into four different Eb=N0 ranges and ﬁnally identify service types
that can be used in each range. The Eb=N0 map for one stadium level is shown in
Figure 11.17.
Assuming a uniform subscriber distribution, the percentage of subscribers connecting
to the service in a particular Eb=N0 range is the same as the percentage of coverage for
that range. The resulting user distribution in the Eb=N0 range and R99 trafﬁc in each
range (in erlangs) is shown in Table 11.13.
Only OVSF codes with a spreading factor up to SF128 are used for the service types
shown in Table 11.13. The required number of OVSF codes per service type and Eb=N0
range is as shown in Table 11.14.
As was the case with HSPA and LTE technologies, call blocking rates are calculated as
in ITU (2013) and are as shown in Table 11.15.
For a sector with 1000 subscribers, the R99 voice blocking rate is 1.6% throughout the
bowl seating area. Most macro UMTS networks use a busy-hour call blocking rate target

between 1% and 2%. Other R99 service types have higher blocking rates, but this is not of
much concern because they are supported with better rates in 3G and 4G networks. The
conclusion is that the call blocking rate for R99 trafﬁc is acceptable and therefore the 24
sector conﬁguration is sufﬁcient to support voice trafﬁc for 3G and 4G subscribers for
WSP A.
11.2.10
RF Coverage Design
For the RF signal to be dominant at the venue, it has to be slightly stronger than the
residual signal coming from surrounding macrocell sites. As most stadiums are open-air,
the residual macro signal itself is usually fairly strong. However, the large number of
sectors required for WSPs implies that highly directional high-gain antennas need to be
deployed, which means that high received power in the seating area can easily be
achieved. Figure 11.18, which shows LTE reference signal received power (RSRP)
coverage at the bowl, makes it clear that an RSRP of 75 dBm or better is easily
achieved over 90% of the bowl.
The modulation scheme used in LTE networks is directly related to PDSCH SINR, as
high SINR makes possible high-order modulation such as 64-QAM. High-order
modulation has high spectral efﬁciency, which allows for a high maximum achievable
data rate (MADR) in the network. However, a large number of sectors also implies
numerous sector overlaps, which may cause interference and lower SINR. An example of
a 24-sector LTE PDSCH SINR plot is shown in Figure 11.19.Figure depicting LTE RSRP coverage at the stadium.
Figure 11.18 LTE RSRP coverage at the stadium.

361
11 In-Building Case StudiesFigure depicting LTE PDSCH SINR coverage at the stadium.

Based on the SINR coverage distribution, the downlink MADR distribution across the
stadium is then calculated, as shown in Figure 11.20.
11.2.11
Summary
A neutral-host DAS solution is cost-effective for stadium networks in which multiple
commercial and non-commercial networks must share infrastructure. Stadium net­
works are characterized by a very high density of users who need many sectors to satisfy
their data needs. The high sectoriszation requirement is addressed by using highly
directional DAS antennas, which provide good spatial signal isolation. This also helps to
control sector overlap and minimizes intersector interference.
The RF propagation environment differs vastly within the stadium, from pure LOS in
the seating area, to LOS with a lot of reﬂections in retail areas underneath the bowl, to
NLOS in locker rooms and conference rooms. To properly model the coverage, 3-D
modelling of the venue is essential. Most stadiums have open-air seating areas andFigure depicting downlink LTE MADR coverage at the stadium.

362
Indoor Wireless Communications
therefore many have signiﬁcant residual macro coverage in those areas. As the stadium
network signal must be dominant everywhere inside the venue, it is essential to perform
an RF survey to determine the residual signal strength prior to designing the DAS. Since
spectators tend to spend time outside the venue before and after events, the design area
should be extended to parking lots, side streets and nearby bus and train stations.
Finally, neutral-host DAS networks with high-power ampliﬁers are susceptible to PIM
generation and PIM can severely impact the stadium network. LTE is particularly
sensitive to PIM because it has low thermal noise power (121 dBm). Care must be taken
at the design stage to avoid PIM generation by using equipment with a PIM rating of
162 dBc at 2  35 dBm. Also, antennas must not be placed near metallic structures
because this tends to generate PIM as well.

Shopping Centre
Contemporary shopping malls offer more than just shopping opportunities, as many
include individual restaurants and bars, a food court, movie theatre, gym, skate ring, etc.
Malls nowadays serve as anchors of social life in suburban areas and visitors consider
wireless connectivity an important factor of their shopping mall experience. Mall
management recognizes this and therefore considers an in-building network that
provides superior mall wireless coverage and quality as a value-added commodity.
11.3.1
Scenario
In this case study, our shopping mall is a two-storey enclosed structure with concrete
outer walls and a glass sunroof. The mall is 200 metres long end to end and up to 60
metres wide. It has three big anchor retail stores, which also have separate entrances
from the open-air parking lot, and many small retail shops that can only be accessed from
inside the mall. The upper level ﬂoor has an open view of the lower level pedestrian
trafﬁc, similar to what is represented in Figure 2.8, Chapter 2. A 3-D presentation of the
mall is shown in Figure 11.21.
While the parking lot has good signal reception coming from the nearby macrocells,
the mall management has received many complaints about signal coverage and quality
within the mall. To that end, the mall management wants to have an indoor wirelessFigure depicting 3-D representation of a shopping mall.

network built that would improve customer experience inside the mall for three major
wireless service providers (WSPs). The network also needs to carry a ﬁrst responders
(E911) network. Wi-Fi installation is not needed as the mall management has already
installed a Wi-Fi network. The management does not want antennas installed inside any
shops. The antennas need to be as small and inconspicuous as possible, so as not to
interfere with interior mall aesthetics. The lower and upper level mall ﬂoor plans are
shown in Figure 11.22.
11.3.2
Design Requirements
Speciﬁc design requirements for the venue are as follows.
11.3.2.1
RF Coverage
 RF coverage should be provided for the following technologies:
- UMTS
- LTE
- Trunked radio (Tait technology).
 The following frequency bands should be included in the network:
- SMR band (800 MHz)

364
Indoor Wireless Communications
- Cellular band (850 MHz)
- PCS band (1900 MHz)
- AWS band (2100 MHz).
 The coverage should include common areas and retail shops accessible to mall visitors
on both levels.
 For trunked radio, the coverage should extend to back hallways and loading docks.
 The mall has an outside parking lot that has sufﬁcient coverage and need not be
targeted for coverage by the in-building network.
 Target signal strength is:
- UMTS CPICH = 85 dBm
- LTE RSRP = 95 dBm
- Trunked radio Rx = 95 dBm.
 As the mall has a glass sunroof, a residual macro signal may be present in the middle of
the mall. To ensure in-building signal dominance in the presence of a macro signal, the
in-building signal should be 5-7 dB stronger than the residual macro signal.
 Handoff between in-building and macro networks should be limited to mall entrance
areas.
 For trunked radio, the coverage needs to be 100% throughout the mall including back
hallways and stores; for cellular technologies the target coverage is 95%.
 The in-building signal should not exceed 100 dBm at the distance of 30 metres
outside the mall.
11.3.2.2
Antenna Placement Restrictions
 Antennas may not be placed inside any stores, including anchor stores.
 WSPs and ﬁrst responders must share antennas.
 The mall management requires that any in-building antennas mounted in the
common areas should be as small and inconspicuous as possible so as to not to
disturb the mall interior aesthetics.
 This requirement does not apply to back hallways, access docks, freight elevator, etc.
11.3.3
Solution
As the in-building system has to include multiple technologies and bands, the in-
building network should use a neutral host distributed antenna system (DAS). Due to the
proximity of antennas to customers, and to comply with ICNIRP guidelines for limiting
exposure to time-varying EM ﬁelds (ICNIRP, 1998), low power DAS remote units should
be used. In this context, low transmit power means up to 24 dBm composite transmit
power per ampliﬁer.
11.3.4
Antenna Choice and Placement
An important design requirement is that antennas must be small and not immediately
obvious to mall visitors. A good choice is the selection of antennas manufactured by
Andrew. The omnidirectional Andrew Cellmax O-25 has 0.85 dBd of gain, a V-plane
beamwidth of 40° and an H-plane beamwidth of 360°. The directional Andrew Cellmax
D-25 has 4.85 dBd of gain, a V-plane beamwidth of 60° and an H-plane beamwidth of

365
11 In-Building Case StudiesPhotograph depicting omnidirectional Andrew Cellmax antenna in front of a retail store.
Figure 11.23 Omnidirectional Andrew Cellmax antenna in front of a retail store.
70°. Vertical beamwidths are chosen to illuminate higher and lower ﬂoors without
causing interference, whereas the horizontal beamwidth for the directional antennas
permits restriction of the coverage horizontally in areas such as corridors, as well as
shaping such coverage for speciﬁc sectors.
Another important requirement is to maximize coverage inside stores while placing
antennas outside stores. Omnidirectional antennas should be mounted ﬂush against the
ceiling in front of individual retail stores in common access areas. An example of an
Andrew Cellmax omnidirectional antenna installation is shown in Figure 11.23.
Occasionally, mall management may require indoor antennas to be completely
invisible. This requirement can be satisﬁed by mounting antennas behind the ceiling,
using a behind-ceiling mounting kit. An example of an antenna that can be mounted
behind the ceiling is Galtronics PEAR M4773 omnidirectional antenna, shown in
Figure 11.24.
The second requirement is that, while anchor stores are excluded from coverage
requirements, there should be an indoor signal present in the vicinity of the store
entrance, to facilitate handover with the macro network. To facilitate that requirement, a
directional antenna should be mounted in the common mall area, opposite the anchor
store and pointing toward the store entrance. A good choice is the Andrew Cell-Max
TM
D-25 directional antenna with 4.85 dBd gain, a V-plane beamwidth of 60 degrees and an
H-plane beamwidth of 70 degrees. An example of an Andrew Cell-Max
TM directional
antenna installation is shown in Figure 11.25.
11.3.5
RF Coverage Design
The suggested DAS antenna plan layout is shown in Figure 11.26. Antenna locations on
both levels were chosen to maximize coverage inside the shops, while keeping in mind
antenna installation restrictions outlined by the mall management. This explains why

Indoor Wireless Communications

antennas are placed in almost exact locations on both levels. Looking at UMTS CPICH
and LTE RSRP coverage, it can be veriﬁed that required signal levels were attained with
this design.The predicted UMTS CPICH coverage is also shown in Figure 11.26.
If the cumulative percentage distribution is analysed in Figure 11.26, the UMTS
CPICH signal is greater than 85 dBm at 94.8% of the lower level area and at 96.2% of the
upper level area. It can be concluded that over 95% of the total area has a UMTS CPICH
signal greater than 85 dBm, which satisﬁes the UMTS design target at the AWS
frequency band.
On the other hand, the LTE RSRP coverage is shown in Figure 11.27. Similarly, the
LTE RSRP is greater than 95 dBm over 94.9% of the lower level area and over 96.6% of
the upper level area. It can be concluded that over 95% of the total area has an LTE RSRPPhotograph depicting directional Andrew Cellmax antenna pointing towards an anchor store.

signal greater than 85 dBm, which also satisﬁes the design target at the PCS frequency
band.
11.3.6
Capacity Dimensioning
In order to properly dimension the in-building network, the number of sectors required
to support each carrier's capacity needs to be determined. The number of sectors per
carrier depends on the number of visitors during the busiest time of the day, carrier's
subscriber penetration rate and carrier's mobile trafﬁc proﬁle.
First, the number of visitors at the mall during the busiest time of day is estimated.
This information may be obtained from a public online source, such as the Travel and
Leisure newsletter, which lists the annual number of visitors for most visited shopping
malls in the USA (TLM, 2014). Alternatively, this information may be obtained directly
from the mall management. Let us assume that 5000 visitors are at the mall during the
busiest hour. Let us also assume that the three WSPs that are included in the in-building
network have the following characteristics:
WSP A:
- Cellular band (850 MHz), 2 UMTS channels

The subscriber penetration rate is the percentage of the WSP subscribers among the
general population. Let us assume that 3G and 4G trafﬁc distribution at the mall per
service type per visitor is as shown in Table 11.16. For each service type, the duration of
the network connection during the busy-hour is expressed in mE (millierlangs) per
subscriber. The probability that a subscriber will attempt to use that service type during
the busy-hour is expressed in a percentage. Finally, the ﬁxed data rate in kb/s is deﬁned
for each service type.

It is assumed that voice trafﬁc is carried over the WCDMA (R99) protocol, while 3G
and 4G sata are carried over HSPA and LTE protocols. Further, it is also assumed that
data subscribers are equally divided between HSPA and LTE networks. Based on the
subscriber penetration, the number of customers at the venue for each WSP is calculated
as follows:
 WSP A: 5000  0:4  2000 customers
 WSP B: 5000  0:35  1750 customers
 WSP C: 5000  0:25  1250 customers.
Next, the HSPA and LTE SINR coverage throughout the mall is calculated and broken
down into intervals based on the modulation scheme that can be achieved in each
interval. An example is shown in Table 11.17, where in the region where LTE PDSCH
SINR > 20 dB, 64 QAM modulations with coding rate R  0:93 is possible, which gives
a spectral efﬁciency of 5.5 b/s/Hz. With an SINR between 15 and 20 dB, the spectral
efﬁciency is 3.9 b/s/Hz; with an SINR between 9 and 15 dB, the efﬁciency is 2.4 b/s/Hz;
etc.
The LTE SINR coverage at both levels is shown in Figure 11.28, with the same SINR
intervals as in Table 11.17.
By knowing the relationship between signal modulation, spectral efﬁciency and SINR,
the number of resources needed to support each service type listed in Table 11.17 may be
calculated. The 'resources' have different names for different technologies: in LTE a
resource is a physical resource block (PRB); in UMTS a resource is the orthogonal code.
As spectral efﬁciency varies with SINR, so does the number of resources needed to
support a certain service type in each SINR zone. For example, if the SINR is high, only

one PRB may be needed to support email, but if the SINR is low, two or more PRBs are
needed to provide the service.
A detailed data capacity dimensioning example is presented in Section 11.2.9 for a
stadium. For the shopping centre in consideration, only critical steps are outlined. A
uniform user distribution throughout the mall is assumed; that is the percentage of users
within a particular SINR range is the same as the SINR coverage percentage in that same
range. For WSP A, 500 HSPA and 500 LTE subscribers per sector are assumed. Let us
also assume the same LTE SINR coverage shown in Figure 11.28. Based on this
information and on the busy-hour trafﬁc per subscriber depicted in Table 11.16, the
total busy-hour trafﬁc in erlangs for LTE technology is calculated and presented in
Table 11.18.
For each SINR range, the required number of primary resource blocks needed to carry
the service needs to be calculated. An example of such calculations can be found in the
stadium case study in Section 11.2. Once we have that information, we proceed to
calculate the encountered blocking rate as stated in ITU (2013), per service type and
SINR range, which is shown in Table 11.19.
Based on the information in Tables 11.18 and 11.19, carried trafﬁc per service type and
SINR range can be calculated, as depicted in Table 11.20.
The composite blocking rate for multiple services is deﬁned as 1-carried/offered trafﬁc.
As the total carried trafﬁc from Table 11.20 is 21.83 erlangs and the total offered trafﬁc

from Table 11.18 is 22.5 erlangs, the composite blocking rate is 3%; the duty cycle is 4.9%
and the datausageis 6.26 GB. If these ﬁgures are deemed acceptable, we may conclude that
two LTE sectors, each supporting up to 500 subscribers, are sufﬁcient to carry LTE trafﬁc
at the mall for WSP A. The same calculation is done for HSPA technology with a similar
conclusion: two sectors are sufﬁcient to carry HSPA trafﬁc at the mall for WSP A. With
that, we completed our capacity calculation for WSP A and may nowproceed with the
sectorization. We can also carry out similar calculations for WSP B and C, to verify the
number of sectors needed to support their trafﬁc requirements.

Sectorization
The sectorization plan for the two-sector DAS within the shopping centre is shown in
Figure 11.29. This is the so-called wedge sectorization where areas of different ﬂoors
stacked on top of each other belong to the same sector. By utilizing this plan, handoff
between adjacent in-building sectors is isolated to the same area on both levels.
The sectorization plan divides coverage almost equally between the sectors, while
keeping the handoff area outside the food court and large anchor store, having a large
number of visitors.
11.3.8
Data Rate Coverage
Finally, the LTE maximum achievable data rate (MADR) coverage plots are shown
in Figure 11.30. It is assumed that the LTE channel is 10 MHz, the macro signal isFigure depicting two-sector sectorization plan: (a) lower level and (b) upper level.

at 90 dBm just outside the mall and that a 2  2 MIMO was deployed. As expected, the
MADR is the highest (dark) near DAS antennas, where UE is in LOS with the antennas.
On the other hand, the MADR is the lowest (brighter) in between sectors, since the
intersector interference is the highest at the edge of the sector.
11.3.9
Summary
A large two-story shopping centre has a poor existing macro signal coverage and there is
a need for a dedicated in-building wireless system. As an example, three WSPs are
included in the in-building network, as well as a ﬁrst responders (public safety) network.
The three WSPs support UMTS and LTE technologies at the cellular, PCS and AWS

band, which dictates the use of a neutral host DAS as the solution. Since the mall has two
levels, 3-D modelling of the venue is essential.
Aesthetic aspects dictate the DAS design at the shopping mall more than at any other
public venue. A typical mall management request is that antennas may not be installed
inside any stores. To overcome this restriction, directional antennas were used to
provide better signal penetration inside anchor and retail stores. Antennas also must be
visually appealing and must 'blend in' with the surrounding environment. Good choices
to fulﬁl this requirement are the Andrew Cellmax O-25 and D-25 antennas. As the DAS
serves multiple in-building base station sectors, a sectorization plan must be developed
for each operator. The plan should minimize DAS sector overlap, as the interference is
the highest at sector boundaries. In this example, the wedge sectorization plan was
adopted as it minimizes the sector overlap on each level.
11.4
Business Campus
Ofﬁce buildings are very diverse venues. These buildings vary in layout, size and number
of ﬂoors, as discussed in Chapter 2. Ofﬁce buildings are often grouped together in a
business campus. A typical business campus has a cluster of multilevel ofﬁce buildings
located off public streets. Very often a business campus has a single tenant that uses the
campus as its corporate headquarters. An example business campus with a dozen
multilevel ofﬁce buildings is shown in Figure 11.31.
Business campuses that have multiple tenants are less common. In a multitenant
campus, the in-building network is most often built piecewise for each tenant or building
instead of all at once across the whole campus. This is not a preferred way to deploy a
network because it is time-consuming and therefore more costly.
11.4.1
Scenario
In our speciﬁc case study, the business campus consists of two buildings. The larger
building has an 80 metre by 20 metre rectangular cross-section and ten ﬂoors. ThePhotograph depicting a major business campus with a dozen office buildings.
Figure 11.31 A major business campus with a dozen ofﬁce buildings.

smaller building has a 60 metre by 17 metre rectangular cross-section and six ﬂoors.
Each ﬂoor is 3 metres high. The buildings are 30 metres apart and directly across from
each other. A three-dimensional representation of the venue is shown in Figure 11.32.
The two buildings have a single tenant who requires good voice and data coverage
throughout both buildings. As the company has adopted a 'bring your own device to
work' policy, the employees use their own smart phones for business, for which they are
reimbursed, monthly, by the company. In order to provide good coverage for everybody,
all major wireless service providers (WSP) must be included in the network.
11.4.2
Design Requirements
Speciﬁc design requirements for the venue are as follows.
11.4.2.1
RF Coverage
 RF coverage should be provided for the following technologies:
- UMTS
- LTE
- Trunked radio (public safety).
 The coverage should include stairs and four lifts in two elevator shafts.
 The in-building wireless (IBW) target signal level should be 5 to 7 dB greater than the
residual macro signal for all WSPs. This is to ensure that the IBW predominates
throughout both buildings.
 It is preferable to measure residual macro coverage on all ﬂoors. However, if it is not
feasible to perform a detailed RF survey on all ﬂoors, the coverage may be approxi­
mated by adding 1 to 2 dB per ﬂoor (Martijn and Herben, 2003). This approximation

376
Indoor Wireless Communications
applies only to ﬂoors that are lower than the height of neighbouring macro sites. For
ﬂoors above the height of neighbouring macro sites, residual macro coverage does not
signiﬁcantly increase with ﬂoor height.
 Minimum signal strength is UMTS CPICH = 85 dBm, LTE RSRP = 95 dBm and
Trunked Radio Rx = 95 dBm, and may be adjusted depending on the residual macro
coverage.
11.4.2.2
Handoff Management
 Establish a clear handoff area between the macro network and the in-building network
in the areas where most of the trafﬁc occurs (entrance lobby, parking area entrance,
etc.).
 Once a user hands off from the macro network, he should remain on the in-building
network throughout the duration of his stay in the building.
 The number of handoffs from one in-building sector to another should be minimized.
If sectors are designed horizontally, the only areas where a handoff can occur are in a
stairwell area or inside an elevator. Handoffs in stairwell areas are allowed because the
users are moving at pedestrian speed, thus allowing plenty of time for a handoff to
complete. Allowing handoffs to occur in a moving elevator is undesirable because
elevators generally move too fast for handoffs to complete. Figure 11.33 shows a cross-
section of the taller building showing the two elevator shafts.
Each elevator shaft holds two elevator cars (marked with an 'X'). Only one elevator car
per shaft is visible in Figure 11.33 because the lifts are side by side in the elevator shaft.
The slim area between the shafts is the lift bank area. The signal at lift banks is not strongFigure depicting cross-section of the taller building with two elevator shafts.
Figure 11.33 Cross-section of the taller building with two elevator shafts.

377
11 In-Building Case Studies
enough to penetrate into the shafts, and that lack of coverage is represented by the white
background in the shafts.
11.4.2.3
Interference Management
 To minimize interference between the macro and in-building network, many WSPs
mandate that the IBW signal level must drop to a speciﬁed value at a speciﬁed distance
outside the building. This is called signal leakage. An example of signal leakage outside
a building is shown in Figure 11.34.
 Many ofﬁce buildings have large panoramic windows that have low (less than 5 dB)
penetration loss, making it a challenge to meet the above requirement.
 In-building signal containment is especially important in a campus environment
because buildings may be close to each other. Overlapping coverage from one building
to another may cause excessive interference, lower capacity and reduced data rate.
 For this particular project, UMTS CPICH at a distance of 30 metres from the exterior
of each building must be 90 dBm or less, LTE RSRP must be 100 dBm or less and
Trunked Radio Rx must be 100 dBm or less.
In the following sections the design of an in-building wireless network to meet the
common requirements is discussed, while the most common design mistakes are
highlighted.Figure depicting example of a signal leakage from antennas on the ground floor.
Figure 11.34 Example of a signal leakage from antennas on the ground ﬂoor.

11.4.3
Solution
As neutral host small cells are not commercially viable yet, the best solution is a
distributed antenna system (DAS). In the shorter building, the DAS is fed by one trunked
radio sector, one UMTS sector and two LTE sectors. The taller building has one trunked
radio sector, two UMTS sectors and three LTE sectors. Details of capacity calculations
are omitted for the sake of brevity.
Public safety (PS) has additional technological, regulatory and jurisdictional require­
ments, summarized in Spindler (2015). PS and WSPs may be deployed in a converged
DAS or two separate DAS may be built, one for PS and one for all WSPs. The decision
whether to deploy the converged or the discrete DAS architecture should be based on
EIRP, spectrum bands and technologies that are being deployed.
11.4.4
Interference Control
One of the most popular choices for in-building DAS antennas is omnidirectional, as a
ceiling mounted installation is normally available in ofﬁce corporates, as depicted in
Figure 11.35. The Andrew Cell-Max
TM O-25 is a good option for this. This antenna has a
gain of 0.85 dBd and a V-plane beamwidth of 40°. As with all omnidirectional antennas,
the H-plane beamwidth is 360° and the front-to-back ratio is 0 dB.
The signal level is greater than 85 dBm over 97:6% of the ﬂoor plan. This coverage
may seem acceptable at ﬁrst. However, the RF coverage requirement also includes the
signal leakage outside the buildings. Let us examine the RF leakage when omni­
directional antennas are used (Figure 11.36). The ground-ﬂoor antenna locations are
indicated by the arrows.
The RF signal is not well contained inside the building; the UMTS signal level just
outside the smaller building is around 75 dBm. As the two buildings are 30 metres
apart, it is clear that the requirement for the leaked signal to be limited to 90 dBm is not
satisﬁed.
The solution to minimize this unacceptable leakage is to use directional antennas. A
very popular choice is the V-polarized Andrew Cell-Max
TM D-25 antenna, which has a
Figure 11.35 In-building RF coverage using omnidirectional antennas.

maximum boresight gain of 4:85 dBd, an H-plane beamwidth of 70 dB, a V-plane
beamwidth of 60 dB and a front-to-back ratio of 20 dB. This antenna can be mounted
vertically against a wall or column. Figure 11.37 shows the resultant RF coverage, with an
arrow pointing in the direction of the main lobe of each antenna.
Using directional antennas has reduced the RF coverage to 91:4%. However, coverage
at the edges is also reduced, which helps in suppressing RF leakage. Most of the energy is
directed towards the middle, the direction in which the antennas are aimed. A good
front-to-back ratio ensures that energy coming from sidelobes is low, which further
reduces leakage.
Figure 11.38 shows a three-dimensional view of coverage between the buildings with
the use now of directional antennas. Note that leakage levels have been signiﬁcantly
reduced.
The leaked RF coverage with directional antennas is 10 to 15 dB lower than with the
omnidirectional antennas. This is a signiﬁcant reduction and shows that directional
antennas can help with interference control.

TM D-25 directional antennas.

380
Indoor Wireless CommunicationsFigure depicting RF leakage with directional antennas.
Figure 11.38 RF leakage with directional antennas.
11.4.5
Lift Coverage
Another important aspect of the design is the provision of coverage inside the lifts. As
can be seen from the in-building RF coverage in Figure 11.35 and Figure 11.37, there is
no RF coverage in the elevator shafts due to the high penetration loss of the elevator
doors. A much simpliﬁed vertical cross-section of the building showing a three-sector in-
building RF coverage with two elevator shafts with no coverage is shown in Figure 11.33.
The simplest solution to provide the required coverage may seem to be to simply add
omnidirectional antennas on each ﬂoor at the elevator banks. Doing so would extend
each sector's coverage into the shaft, as shown in Figure 11.39, in which omnidirectional
antennas are represented by dots. However, applying this solution would increase the
risk of dropped calls in moving elevators. A handoff takes 2 to 3 seconds to complete, and
user equipment (UE) that goes from sector 1 (lower ﬂoors) straight to sector 3 (upper
ﬂoors) would not have enough time to execute the handoff from one sector to another;
calls would be dropped.
An alternative solution is to place RF equipment inside the lifts and/or the elevator
shafts. A clear advantage of this approach is that the coverage does not rely on signal
penetration through the metal doors. A disadvantage is that some municipalities in
North America do not allow any electronic equipment inside elevator shafts due to the
ﬁre hazard. There are a few types of coverage solution with electronics inside the shaft.
One, as shown in Figure 11.40, is to place an indoor antenna inside the lift, connected to a
DAS by means of a cable. Here the handoff can occur only when the lift is stopped and
passengers are entering or leaving it, greatly reducing the possibility of a dropped call.
However, the antenna needs to be connected to a DAS remote unit via a cable, which
makes this type of solution impractical in buildings with many ﬂoors.
Another solution, shown in Figure 11.41, is to install a directional DAS antenna on top
of the elevator shaft, pointing down the shaft. A donor directional antenna is located on
the top of each lift, pointed upward at the DAS antenna. The donor antenna is connected

via a jumper cable to an omnidirectional serving antenna located inside the lift. The
antenna pair used at each lift is purely used as a passive repeater system.
If the DAS antenna has a CPICH EIRP of 20 dBm, and if the target signal inside each
elevator is 85 dBm one metre away from the serving antenna, the maximum path loss is
20  85  105 dB. A typical antenna gain is 7 dBi for directional antennas and 3 dBi for
omnidirectional, ones while a 1 dB loss is typical for a 1 metre RF jumper cable. It is of
interest to calculate the maximum distance between the antenna on top of the shaft and
the lift. Some simple free-space path loss calculations at 2.1 GHz, also taking into
account the 8 dB gain due to the waveguide effect inside the shaft (Spindler, 21015), show
this maximum distance to be approximately 115 metres.
If the shaft is longer than 115 metres, another DAS antenna may be mounted at the
bottom of the shaft, pointing upwards. This antenna sends a signal that is captured by
another directional donor antenna located at the bottom of the elevator, pointing down
the shaft. This donor antenna at the bottom of each lift is connected to the same serving
antenna inside the lift. To ensure a proper handoff, RF coverage overlap between the two
DAS antennas in the shaft must be accounted for. Typically, 10  15% of the antenna
range is given to overlap, so with 15% coverage overlap the maximum distance between
the top and bottom DAS antennas is 2  115  2  15  200 metres.
A third possible solution is to install radiating cable along the length of the shaft.
This approach provides more uniform coverage than using a DAS directional antenna
(Stamopoulos, Aragón-Zavala and Saunders, 2003). Depending on shaft length and
cable attenuation per metre, the signal may be strong enough to penetrate the lift,
making the passive repeater unnecessary. This solution is illustrated in Figure 11.42,
where the radiating cable is shown as a solid black line between the lift and the lift
bank.

11.4.6
Detailed RF Coverage Design
To properly represent RF coverage at the venue, the coverage leakage from both
buildings into the area between the buildings must be included in the analysis of the
ground-ﬂoor level coverage. Examples of ground-ﬂoor level LTE RSRP coverage are
shown in Figure 11.43 and Figure 11.44.Figure depicting LTE RSRP coverage inside and between the buildings.
Figure 11.43 LTE RSRP coverage inside and between the buildings.

384
Indoor Wireless Communications
Figure  depi ctin g f ull 3-D repres en tat ion of LTE R SRP cov era ge between the buildings.
For UMTS, a pilot signal (CPICH) coverage and Ec=I0 coverage are of interest. As the
signal from the same sector is multicast on the same ﬂoor, Ec=I0 is very uniform as there
is no intersector interference. The signal from the other building does interfere because
it belongs to a different sector. The result is shown in Figure 11.45.
SINR and maximum achievable data rate (MADR) coverage are also of interest. As is
the case with UMTS Ec=I0, antenna simulcast removes interference between antennas
on the same ﬂoor, which causes high SINR. However, the signal from the other building
does interfere and causes poor SINR between the buildings, as shown in Figure 11.46.
Good SINR coverage also means that MADR is very high inside buildings. MADR for a
10 MHz LTE SISO is shown in Figure 11.47.

Summary
In-building coverage is required in a business campus with a single tenant who occupies
two buildings. The tenant has adopted a 'bring your own device to work' policy, so all
major WSPs need to be included in the system. First responders (public safety) also need
to be included. Based on the requirements that multiple technologies and multiple
frequency bands need to be included, a hybrid neutral-host DAS is chosen. To model the
coverage properly, three-dimensional modelling of the venue is essential. Due to the
close proximity of the buildings, the overlapping in-building coverage from one building

386
Indoor Wireless Communications
to the other must be taken into account. During the design process, care must be taken to
contain the RF signal within the buildings as much as possible. This is most efﬁciently
done by choosing directional antennas rather than omnidirectional ones. Coverage often
needs to be provided in stairwells and lifts. Lifts are especially challenging in municipal­
ities that prohibit electronic equipment inside elevator shafts due to the ﬁre hazard.
Where such equipment is permitted, the most effective solution is radiating cable or a
combination of a DAS antenna in each shaft and a passive repeater in each elevator.

Underground (Subway)
Rapid rail transit is a common term for the type of local passenger train service found in
many large cities throughout the world. As of 2013, 178 cities worldwide had rapid rail
transit, with 7000 train stations and 8000 km of rail. The world's busiest systems are
Tokyo with 3.2 billion passengers annually, followed by Seoul and Beijing with 2.5 billion
each. The largest system is in New York, which has 468 rail transit stations, closely
followed by Seoul with 429, with Paris a distant third with 300 (iBwave, 2013).
While rapid rail transit differs from city to city, there are some common character­
istics. A rapid rail transit system always covers the core urban area of the city (town
centre), the main commercial and/or tourist area, and must also reach major surround­
ing areas where commuters live (suburbs). As most trafﬁc occurs when commuters
travel to and from work, the busiest times (rush-hours) are in the morning hours and in
late afternoon and early evening. In a typical system, most stations in the core urban area
are located below ground and are interconnected with tunnels while, in suburban areas,
some stations may be below ground and others at ground level. Distances between urban
stations are generally shorter than distances between suburban stations.
A train station in a core urban area typically serves more than one rail line. Some
stations operate two rail lines from a single platform. Other stations accommodate more
rail lines by digging deeper underground, and have multiple platforms, one stacked
above the other. These platforms are interconnected by stairs, escalators and lifts. A
simpliﬁed view of a station with multiple platforms is shown in Figure 11.48.
There are many examples worldwide of rapid transit stations sharing facilities with
regional passenger train services; among the best known are Union station in Washing­
ton DC, Amsterdam Centraal railway station and London Victoria station. These
stations also have a large number of retail shops and cafés located in the general access
area between the station entrance and the entrance to the train platforms. This must be
taken into account when sizing the wireless networks, as the shopping and dining
opportunities cause commuters to spend more time at the station than they would
otherwise.
11.5.1
Scenario
While macro coverage near the station entrance and inside the entry hall is acceptable,
the coverage beyond ticket booths at escalators, hallways, train platforms and inside
tunnels is often poor to non-existent. The two systems are located on separate platforms
and each platform ends with a wide tunnel with two sets of tracks that carry trafﬁc in
both directions. The new wireless network at the station has to support major wireless

service providers (WSP) in the city, as well as the city Emergency Service network and
Wi-Fi. The network also has to cover inside tunnels linking stations; however, Wi-Fi
does not need to be provided in tunnels. The Emergency Service network has to be
available inside trains at all times, even when two trains are stopped next to each other
inside a tunnel. Target coverage areas at the venue are illustrated in Figure 11.49.
11.5.2
Design Requirements
11.5.2.1
RF Coverage
RF coverage at the station must provide the following wireless technologies:
 GMS
 UMTS
 LTE
 Trunked Radio (Public Safety)
 Wi-Fi (802.11n).
The following frequency bands must be included in the network:
 700 MHz
 SMR band (800 MHz)
 Cellular band (850 MHz)
 PCS band (1900 MHz)
 AWS band (2100 MHz)
 2.4 GHz.
The coverage at the station must include the entry hall with retail shops, train
platforms, ticket booths, stairs, escalators and hallways. A 3-D view is shown in
Figure 11.50. The coverage must also extend into tunnels for all technologies except
Wi-Fi and for all bands except the 2.4 GHz band. An important requirement is that

Emergency Service coverage inside trains must be present even when trains are stopped
in a tunnel next to each other.
Target RF signal strength values are as follows:
 GSM BCCH 85 dBm
 UMTS CPICH 85 dBm
 LTE RSRP 95 dBm
 Trunked Radio Rx 95 dBm
 Wi-Fi Rx 75 dBm.
For trunked radio, coverage is required at 100% of the station and tunnels. For cellular
technologies, coverage is required at over 95% of the station and tunnels. For Wi-Fi,
coverage is required at over 95% of the station only. These design values are typical for
wireless networks.
11.5.2.2
Capacity
During the rush-hour there are 120 train stops at the station. On average, a train spends
30 seconds at the station loading and unloading passengers. A typical train has 10 cars,
and each car can carry up to 150 passengers. At the entry hall are a dozen retail stores and
several small restaurants. During the rush-hour there are 1000 commuters, shopkeepers
and restaurant staff in the entry hall area. In this example, four WSPs require coverage at
the venue; their technology and customer penetration breakdown is as follows:
 WSP A: 30% penetration rate
- GSM 5%
- UMTS 35%
- LTE 60%.
 WSP B: 25% penetration rate
- GSM 5%
- UMTS 40%
- LTE 55%.

390
Indoor Wireless Communications
 WSP C: 25% penetration rate
- GSM 5%
- UMTS 45%
- LTE 50%.
 WSP D: 20% penetration rate
- GSM 10%
- UMTS 60%
- LTE 30%.
A WSP network is sized to support rush-hour trafﬁc with speciﬁed call blocking rates.
For a voice-only network such as GSM, the target voice call blocking rate is between 1%
and 5%, with 2% most commonly used. For voice and data networks such as UMTS and
LTE, the call blocking rate varies with the data rate; an application that requires a high
data rate, such as data download or video streaming, will have a higher call blocking rate.
In such cases, a composite call blocking rate is calculated that takes into account call
blocking rates for individual applications. A typical composite call blocking rate is 5% or
more.
11.5.2.3
Handoff Management
The goal of handoff management is to establish a clear handoff area between two sectors.
Two types of handoff exist: handoffs between macro networks and the in-building
network and those between in-building network sectors. As most of the station is
underground, there is very little residual macro network signal overlap, but is mostly
near the station entrance where the retail shops and restaurants are located. Depending
on the number of subscribers at the station, a WSP may require multiple sectors to
support subscriber trafﬁc. In such cases, the handoff area between the sectors should be
conﬁned to transit areas such as walkways, escalators or stairways. Another potential
handoff area is inside tunnels where handoff must be completed while the train is moving
at full speed.
11.5.3
Solution
As the in-building system has to include multiple WSPs and the Emergency Service (ES)
network, an optimum solution is the use of a neutral host distributed antenna system
(DAS). ES and WSPs may be deployed in a converged DAS or two separate DAS may be
built, one for ES and one for all WSPs. The decision whether to deploy the converged or
the discrete DAS architecture should be based on EIRP, spectrum bands and tech­
nologies that are being deployed. At the station, DAS ampliﬁers (remote units) are
connected via coax cables to point-source antennas. In tunnels, coverage is provided by
radiating cables, sometimes called leaky feeders, which are connected to remote units.
Wi-Fi access points are deployed throughout the station but do not share antennas and
cabling with the DAS. Because Wi-Fi does not support full mobility, there is no
requirement for Wi-Fi coverage in tunnels. As a general principle, Wi-Fi coverage
can be provided inside train cars only if Wi-Fi access points use a cellular network as
wireless backhaul. In that case, the cellular network shares capacity with the Wi-Fi
network and the maximum achievable data rate of the Wi-Fi inside cars is limited by the
maximum achievable data rate for the network in tunnels.

11.5.4
RF Coverage Design
Coverage at the station is best achieved with multiple point-source antennas. At a long
platform with a high or open ceiling, it is best to use directional antennas placed at
opposite ends. In locations with low ceilings, such as walkways, entry halls and stairs like
those shown in Figure 11.49, omnidirectional antennas are best. Antenna equivalent
isotropically radiated power (EIRP) should be kept under 30 dBm so as to limit passive
intermodulation (PIM).
As outlined earlier, the station has two platforms. The Regional Rail platform (Platform
1), equipped with two directional antennas, is shown in Figure 11.51. An illustration of
Platform 1 with two trains stopped next to each other is shown in Figure 11.52. The Rapid
Rail Transit platform (Platform 2) with one train at the platform is shown in Figure 11.53.
If line of sight (LOS) occurs between tunnel exits, directional point-source antennas
mounted at opposite ends may provide sufﬁcient coverage. If not, radiating cables are
recommended. In a tunnel with two tracks, radiating cables carrying public safety signal
should be mounted along opposite walls to provide coverage even when trains are
stopped next to each other. Figure 11.54 illustrates this case, with radiating cables
mounted on opposite walls.
Let us now examine radiating cable length limits. Eupen RMC 78-HLFR cable has
69 dB coupling loss at 1900 MHz and 6.4 dB loss per 100 metres. Assuming that a high
power (10 W) remote unit (RU) is used to feed the cable, 85 dBm received power insideFigure depicting platform 1 with directional antennas at opposite ends.

the train and approximately 5 dB penetration loss for 1 cm thick windows (De Backer
et al., 1996), the maximum path loss is 40  85  5  120 dB. Taking into account
the 69 dB coupling loss, the maximum permissible loss due to cable length is 120 
69  51 dB. At 6.4 dB loss per 100 metres, this maximum cable loss of 51 dB is reached
after only 800 metres.
In tunnels longer than 800 metres, cascading RUs may be used to extend coverage.
However, the use of cascading RUs increases uplink noise per channel, which degrades
uplink data rate and capacity. To maintain uplink performance, carrier-to-noise ratio
(C/N) for the sector with cascaded RUs must be calculated and compared against the
target uplink C/N.
Search window is a UMTS parameter that deﬁnes the maximum path distance that can
be resolved at the receiver. According to the 3GPP RRC Protocol Speciﬁcation (3GPP,
1999), UMTS search window has one of three values: 40 chips (±20 chips), 256 chips
(±128 chips) and 2560 chips (±1280 chips). Taking into account UMTS chip duration
(0:81 μs), the maximum resolvable path difference if the search window is set at 40 chips
is 1560 metres. If the search window is set at 256 chips then the maximum path
difference is 10 kilometres and for 2560 chips it is 100 kilometres. If multipath is greater
than the maximum path difference, it is treated as interference. To combat interference

393
11 In-Building Case Studies
caused by excessive signal delay, the search window size must be adjusted. For example, a
UMTS sector covering a 2-kilometre tunnel should have a search window time set at 256
chips, not 40.
LTE technology counters multipath by introducing a 'guard period', a downlink
transmission gap between consecutive OFDM symbols. This transmission gap is called
the cycle preﬁx (CP) and, according to Sesia, Touﬁk and Baker (2009), the guard period is
5:2 μs for normal CP and 16:7 μs for extended CP if the subchannel spacing is 15 kHz. A
CP duration of 5:2 μs is equivalent to a maximum path difference of 1560 metres, while a
16:7 μs CP duration is equivalent to a 5 kilometre path difference. Therefore a sector
covering a tunnel that is less than 1.56 km long may use normal CP, while extended CP
should be used for tunnels between 1.56 km and 5 km long. On tunnels longer than 5 km,
more than one LTE sector should be used.
If multiple LTE sectors are used in a tunnel, a sufﬁcient coverage overlap must be
maintained to allow for multiple handover tries. When calculating coverage overlap, one
should take into account the train speed at the handover area, and that the signal
strength from both sectors must be above the target level during consecutive handoff
attempts (Tolstrup, 2011). As a handoff attempt takes 2-3 seconds, and at least three
handoff attempts should be possible in the overlapping area, a train should spend at least
10 seconds in the handoff zone. For example, if the train speed is 36 km/h, the handoff
zone should be 100 metres long and the last 100 metres of the radiating cable connected
to one tunnel sector should overlap with the ﬁrst 100 metres of the radiating cable
connected to the next.
11.5.5
Capacity
Capacity sizing determines the number of sectors required to support peak trafﬁc at the
venue. As discussed earlier, on average there are two trains per minute and each train
spends 30 seconds at the station. This implies that there are at least two trains at the
station during the rush-hour. However, these are average numbers and to calculate
maximum peak capacity one must take into account that occasionally as many as four
trains may be at the station simultaneously. Each train has up to 10 cars and each car has
up to 150 passengers, so four trains may carry up to 6000 rush-hour commuters. When
we take into account the presence of 1000 more people in the entry hall shopping and
food area, the maximum number of people at the station during the rush-hour is 7000.
During the rush-hour, according to the customer penetration breakdown, WSP A has
2100 subscribers at the station, WSP B and C have 1750 subscribers each and WSP D has
1400. If we assume two trains in the tunnel during the rush-hour, there are another 3000
commuters there; that is WSP A has 900 subscribers in the tunnel, WSP B and C have
750 each and WSP D has 600.
The next step is to break down the number of subscribers per technology, both inside
tunnels and at the station, taking into account the technology percentage distribution
shown in Table 11.21.
11.5.5.1
Data
The ﬁrst step is to deﬁne subscriber proﬁles for each technology and each WSP. For each
service type, the duration of the network connection during the busy-hour is expressed
in millierlangs (mE) per subscriber. The probability that a subscriber will attempt to use

each service type during the busy-hour is expressed as a percentage. It is important to
note that a subscriber is not limited to one service attempt per busy-hour; rather, he or
she may attempt to use all of the service types listed. A ﬁxed data rate (in kbps) must be
deﬁned for each service type. An example of data trafﬁc distribution at a subway station
is shown in Table 11.22.
It is assumed that voice trafﬁc is carried over the WCDMA (R99) protocol, while 3G
and 4G data are carried over the HSPA and LTE protocols, respectively. LTE SINR
coverage in the venue is calculated and broken down into intervals based on the
modulation scheme that can be achieved in each interval. The example in
Table 11.23 shows that, in the region where LTE PDSCH SINR  20 dB, 64-QAM
modulation with coding rate R  0:93 is possible, which gives a spectral efﬁciency of
5.5 bit/s/Hz. With SINR between 15 and 20 dB, spectral efﬁciency is 3.9 bit/s/Hz, with
SINR between 9 and 15 dB, the efﬁciency is 2.4 bit/s/Hz, etc. These MCS efﬁciency values
assume SISO conﬁguration.
By knowing the relationship between the signal modulation scheme, spectral efﬁ­
ciency and SINR, the number of resources needed to support each service type listed in
Table 11.22 can be calculated. These 'resources' are different for different technologies:
LTE resources are physical resource blocks (PRBs); UMTS resources are HSPA
orthogonal codes; etc. As spectral efﬁciency varies with SINR, so does the number of
resources needed to support a certain service type in each SINR zone. For example, if
SINR is high, a single PRB may be sufﬁcient to support email but, if SINR is low, more
than one PRB may be required.

Next, we produce the downlink LTE SINR coverage map. As sector overlap affects
SINR, an assumption must be made about the number of sectors in the network. The
station has two train platform levels and two additional levels. It is reasonable to assume
that one sector is needed for each train platform. We will also assume that each sector
also covers one additional level. The resultant LTE SINR coverage at the station is shown
in Figure 11.55.
LTE SINR Range 1 (3  SINR  9) covers 10% of the area, SINR Range 2
(9  SINR  15) covers 20% of the area, SINR Range 3 (15  SINR  20) covers 20%
of the area and SINR Range 4 (SINR  20) covers 50% of the area. Assuming a uniform
distribution of spectators (a reasonable assumption), the percentage of LTE users within
each SINR range is the same as the SINR coverage percentage for that range.
Note that LTE SINR Range 1 (3 < SINR < 9) covers 10% of the area, SINR Range 2
(9 < SINR < 15) covers 20% of the area, SINR Range 3 (15 < SINR < 20) covers 20% of the
area and SINR Range 4 (SINR < 20) covers 50% of the area. Assuming a uniform
distribution of commuters (a reasonable assumption), the percentage of LTE users
within each SINR range is the same as the SINR coverage percentage for that range.
Let us assume that LTE has a 10 MHz channel and that there are 500 subscribers per
LTE sector for a total of 1000 LTE subscribers at the station. The LTE busy-hour trafﬁcFigure depicting LTE PDSCH SINR coverage used for the data capacity sizing example.

(in erlangs) is calculated based on the number of subscribers per SINR range and on
busy-hour trafﬁc per subscriber, as given in Table 11.22. The results are shown in
Table 11.24.
The number of resources needed to support the service types across the ranges is
calculated next. This is readily determined if the relationship between SINR and spectral
efﬁciency is known, which can be taken either from research papers (De Backer et al.,
1996) or directly from vendors. Table 11.25 shows, for this example, the distribution of
LTE PRBs for each SINR range.
Based on Tables 11.24 and 11.25, and given the total number of PRBs in the two
10 MHz channel sectors, the blocking probability for each service type can be calculated.
The blocking rate is deﬁned as the percentage of attempted network connections that are
denied due to insufﬁcient network resources. The blocking rate formula for multiple
services used for this calculation is taken from the ITU-R recommendation (3GPP,
1999). The encountered blocking rate for each service type and SINR range is shown in
Table 11.26.
Table 11.26 is the key for sizing the network as it shows the blocking rate for all service
types throughout the station (Ranges 1 to 4). For example, we see that 7.5% of the
attempts to stream video using LTE from the area where LTE SINR > 20 dB (Range 4)
are blocked due to insufﬁcient LTE resources.

If the calculated blocking rates shown in Table 11.26 are deemed unacceptable, then
the number of sectors must be increased, the SINR map recalculated and the capacity
calculations repeated. This is an iterative process that is continued until acceptable
blocking rates are found.
Carried busy-hour trafﬁc is calculated next based on offered trafﬁc (Table 11.24) and
encountered blocking rate (Table 11.26) for each service type. Results are shown in
Table 11.27.
To determine total offered busy-hour trafﬁc at the venue, the entries in Table 11.24 are
summed. To determine carried busy-hour trafﬁc, the entries in Table 11.27 are summed.
Offered LTE trafﬁc is 55 erlangs while carried LTE trafﬁc is 52.07 erlangs. The composite
call blocking rate (CCBR) is calculated as in Equation ()), which, for this example, yields
5.3%.
The duty cycle is deﬁned as the ratio of carried trafﬁc to theoretical maximum trafﬁc
when all resources are used for the full busy-hour and is calculated to be 5.8%. Data usage
is carried trafﬁc during the busy-hour and is calculated to be 17.03 gigabytes (GB).
If the capacity statistics for two LTE sectors carrying trafﬁc for 1000 subscribers are
deemed acceptable, then WSP B and WSP C may use this same sectorization plan as they
have close to 1000 LTE subscribers. For WSP A (1200 subscribers), the SINR coverage
map and capacity statistics need to be recalculated for three LTE sectors. As WSP D has
only 500 subscribers, its sectorization plan calls for one sector only.
The same exercise can be repeated for HSPA. Assuming the same two-sector
conﬁguration, the HSPA SINR coverage map is as shown in Figure 11.56.

HSPA SINR Range 1 (5  SINR  11) covers 6% of the area, SINR Range 2
(11  SINR  22) covers 19% of the area, SINR Range 3 (22  SINR  24) covers
17% of the area and SINR Range 4 (SINR > 24) covers 58% of the area. Let us assume
one 5 MHz RF channel and 400 subscribers per sector for a total of 800 HSPA
subscribers. We then calculate busy-hour trafﬁc in erlangs based on the number of
subscribers per SINR range and on busy-hour trafﬁc per subscriber as given in
Table 11.22. The results are shown in Table 11.28.
The number of HSPA codes needed to support the service types across the zones are
calculated in a similar manner to that used for LTE resource blocks (RBs). The
distribution of HSPA codes per SINR range is shown in Table 11.29.
Based on Table 11.28 and Table 11.29, and given the total number of HSPA codes in
the two sectors, the blocking probabilities for each service type are calculated next.
Encountered blocking rate values for each service type and SINR range are as shown in

gigabytes (GB). Although these results show that the HSPA has a higher blocking rate for
fewer subscribers than the LTE, it should be noted that an LTE RF channel is 10 MHz
wide, twice the spectrum of an HSPA channel (5 MHz).

Voice capacity sizing is based on the assumption that voice trafﬁc will be carried over the
WCDMA (R99) part of the UMTS signal. As an assumption was made that VoIP is not
implemented in the LTE network, voice capacity has to account for both 3G and 4G
subscribers. The number of voice subscribers is shown in Table 11.32.
When deﬁning the subscriber proﬁle for R99, we take into account the fact that data
trafﬁc will switch to R99 data only if both HSPA and LTE are unavailable. Therefore, the
probability of an R99 data call is very low, as reﬂected in the R99 trafﬁc distribution
shown in Table 11.33.
As we did for the data capacity calculations, we ﬁrst determine Eb=N0 coverage
(Eb=N0 is the ratio of energy per bit to noise power spectral density), separate the
coverage into four different Eb=N0 ranges and identify the service types that can be used
in each range. The resultant Eb=N0 coverage map is shown in Figure 11.57, assuming a
two-sector conﬁguration.
The coverage area in which a subscriber may connect to video telephony (dark grey in
Figure 11.57) is also the area in which a connection to switched data and voice is possible.
Assuming a uniform subscriber distribution, the percentage of subscribers connecting to
the service in a particular Eb=N0 range is the same as the percentage of coverage for that
range. If we assume 1000 R99 subscribers per sector for a total of 2000 subscribers in the
venue, the resulting user distribution and R99 trafﬁc per Eb=N0 range (in erlangs) are as
shown in Table 11.34.

Only OVSF codes with a spreading factor up to SF128 are used for the service types
shown in Table 11.34. The required numbers of OVSF codes for each service type and

As was the case with HSPA and LTE technologies, call blocking rates are calculated as
in 3GPP (1999). Results are as shown in Table 11.36.
The R99 blocking rate is deﬁned as the percentage of attempted network connections
that are denied, during the busy-hour, due to insufﬁcient network resources. For two

sectors with 2000 subscribers, the R99 voice blocking rate is just over 1% throughout the
venue. Most macro UMTS networks use a busy-hour call blocking rate target between 1%
and2%. Other R99 service types have higher blocking rates, but this is not of much concern
becausethey aresupported with betterratesinHSPAandLTE networks.Theconclusionis
that the call blocking rate for R99 trafﬁc is acceptable and therefore the two-sector
conﬁguration is sufﬁcient to support voice trafﬁc for both 3G and 4G subscribers.
Although Wi-Fi coverage need not be provided in tunnels because Wi-Fi does not
support high speed and handoff, Wi-Fi can be provided inside the train by placing an
access point inside each car. These access points may use the existing cellular signal in
the tunnel and at the station as wireless backhaul. This is known as train Wi-Fi and is
separate from the Wi-Fi provided at the station. The train Wi-Fi shares capacity with the
WSP that provides wireless backhaul and its maximum achievable data rate is limited by
the backhaul data rate.
11.5.6
Environmental Challenges
Train stations and tunnels are some of the most challenging environments in which to
deploy an in-building wireless system. At these types of venues, more than at any other,
the environment dictates RF design and network maintenance. Some of the proven best
practices are as follows:
 Equipment locations should be chosen for ease of access, not for ease of installation. If
a choice is to be made between having one DAS remote unit in the middle of a tunnel
to feed a bidirectional antenna, or having one RU and one point-source antenna at
each tunnel entrance, the latter should be chosen as two RUs at the entrances are less
expensive to maintain than one RU inside a tunnel.
 When choosing an equipment room location, ease of access should be the most
important criterion; a small room that has 24/7 access is preferable to a bigger room
accessible only when the station is closed to the public.
 When choosing RU locations, consider whether vandals can easily spot and damage or
steal the equipment.
 Each RU should have battery backup power, as power outages at stations and in
tunnels are common. When sizing battery backup power, it should be taken into
account that these power outages are frequent but short.
 If radiating cable is used inside a tunnel, it must be securely attached to the walls;
otherwise, wall vibrations caused by passing trains may loosen the cable and degrade
its performance.

403
11 In-Building Case Studies
 Tunnels are occasionally exposed to water leaks, so all connections should be
waterproofed as rust can cause passive intermodulation (PIM). Passive components
with high ingress protection (IP) liquid rating are preferred, as they are more water-
resistant.
 Another source of PIM is dust, of which there is plenty inside tunnels.
 Some stations may experience AC instabilities, which may reduce the lifetime of the
equipment. In such cases, power converters should be used to convert from AC to DC
and back to AC, thereby ﬁltering out the instabilities.
 Point-source antennas at the station should be placed away from metallic objects, as
these are a known source of PIM. Train stations have such objects hanging from
ceilings and attached to walls. The most signiﬁcant metallic objects, however, are the
trains themselves as they have metal walls. Therefore antennas that cover platforms
should not be mounted immediately above the train tracks.
11.5.7
Radio Coverage Maps
GSM coverage for WSP A in a tunnel, both at train platforms and at the station, is shown
in Figure 11.58 to Figure 11.61. Note that signal strength inside trains is at 85 dBm or
greater, even when trains are next to each other - the worst-case scenario.

11 In-Building Case StudiesFigure depicting LTE SINR coverage.
Figure 11.62 LTE SINR coverage.
For data-centric networks, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) coverage is
key because good SINR coverage facilitates high data rates. Figure 11.62 shows LTE
SINR at the station.
LTE coverage at the station is provided with 14 antennas. At opposite sides of train
platforms, directional antennas are used (Amphenol Jaybeam model 7478000 with
11.5 dBi gain); omnidirectional antennas are used elsewhere (Kathrein model 741 572
with 2.15 dBi gain). Macro network interference is limited to the station entry hall (not
shown). SINR is very high at the platforms and lower where in-building sectors overlap.
Consequently, the maximum achievable data rate (MADR) is also very high at the
platforms and lower elsewhere, as shown in Figure 11.63.Figure depicting LTE MADR coverage.

Summary
A rail station providing service to both regional trains and local rapid transit trains has
poor existing macro coverage and is in need of a dedicated in-building wireless system.
As an example, at this station four WSPs must be included in the in-building network, as
well as Wi-Fi and a First Responders (public safety) network. Wi-Fi coverage at the
station does not extend into the tunnels, while all other wireless services require
coverage in connecting tunnels as well. All four WSPs support 2G, 3G and 4G
technologies across different frequency bands, which dictates the use of a neutral-
host DAS as the solution. Since the station is a multilevel structure, 3-D modelling of the
venue is essential. Inside tunnels, the network has to provide coverage inside trains even
when trains are stopped next to each other. For most tunnels, this requirement dictates
the use of radiating cables, also known as leaky feeders.
There are several environmental factors speciﬁc to such venues that make design
and maintenance a challenge. Rail stations have many metallic objects and, because
proximity to metal objects causes PIM, it is often challenging to ﬁnd good locations
for antennas. In tunnels, damp conditions may cause connectors to rust and
vibrations caused by passing trains may loosen radiating cables; both conditions
generate PIM and therefore degrade network performance. Long tunnels may require
cascaded ampliﬁers to maintain coverage; however, cascading ampliﬁers may increase
uplink noise, which affects uplink capacity and data rate. Another way to maintain
coverage in tunnels is to install multiple sectors; however, sufﬁcient sector coverage
overlap must be provided to allow for multiple handoff attempts at nominal train
speeds.
As a rule, it is preferable to locate equipment so that it is easy to access rather than less
expensive to deploy, as the equipment requires frequent maintenance. One must also be
mindful of vandalism and make the equipment as inconspicuous as possible. The
numerous requirements make this venue type one of the most expensive to design
and operate.
