ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 
This book represents a substantial reworking of the doctoral 
dissertation I presented to the Department of Near Eastern Languages 
and Civilizations of Harvard University in 1991. After spending 1991-
1996 working on other projects, I began the process of revision in the 
summer of 1996, supported in part by a semester teaching leave in 
1997 and two summer research grants in 1997 and 1999 from Emory 
University. I am grateful to the Department of Middle Eastern Studies 
at Emory for providing a very supportive academic home, to John 
Samples, Gail Grella, and Deborah Weiner of Georgetown University 
Press for their patient support of this project, and to two anonymous 
readers who provided valuable feedback on the draft manuscript. I am 
indebted to the friends and colleagues who have contributed so much 
to this work over the years, reading, discussing, advising, and especially 
correcting, and I take full responsibility for the remaining errors. 
The original research upon which this study is based was supported 
by a Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research grant for travel to 
Germany, Morocco, Egypt, Syria, and Kuwait in 1988-89, and greatly 
facilitated by the Commissions .for Educational and Cultural Exchange 
in Morocco and Egypt, and the United States Information Service offices 
in Syria and Kuwait. In Kuwait, Dr. Kazem Behbehani, director of the 
Research Department of the University of Kuwait, arranged affiliation 
and living quarters at the University, and Mr. Ali al-Rumi, director of 
the Kuwaiti Folklore Center, put his resources and staff at my disposal. 
In Germany, Professor Otto Jastrow took time to meet with me and 
offer the wisdom of his experience in fieldwork methodology. 
Field research would not have been possible without the generosity 
and warm hospitality of which Arab culture is deservedly proud. I will 
always be grateful to the many people who opened their doors and 
their lives to me during my fieldwork, taking time to give interviews 
and facilitate contacts with others: in Morocco, the Jebaris, Sidi Belkziz, 
Said Hamzaoui and his family, and Sarah Chayes and her friends; in 
Egypt, Zeinab Ibrahim and her family, Zeinab Taha and her family, 
and Lisa White and Muhammad al-Qawasmi; in Syria, Wajd and Samar

Acknowledgments 
and their friends, the Rabbats, and Dr. Jim Nesby; and in Kuwait, 'Ali 
al-Rayyis, and especially Mariam al-'Agrouga and her family. 
Four people deserve special thanks for suffering through the 
original dissertation above and beyond the call of duty. Hulya Canbakal 
spent many late nights on campus keeping me company and feeding 
me. Michael Cooperson's reading and comments helped me sharpen 
vague ideas, and reassured me that I had something to say. John Eisele 
suffered through illegible rough drafts in record time, while somehow 
teaching me how to present linguistic arguments. Most importantly, 
my advisor, Professor Wolfhart Heinrichs, had the confidence in me to 
approve the project, the patience to wait while I struggled to produce, 
and the beneficence to extend unwavering support. 
I have been privileged to study and work with many of the best 
people in the field. My teachers and mentors at the American University 
in Cairo and Harvard University managed to give me a first-rate education 
despite less-than-full cooperation on my part at times, and my colleagues 
at the Middlebury College School of Arabic 1983- 1987 and 1991-1998 
not only created the cross-dialectal language experience that inspired 
this work, but also gave freely of their time and insights. 
Irrepayable debt is due: John Swanson, who set me on the 
academic path in the first place with a big push; my RRAALL cohorts, 
constant sources of inspiration, moral support, and references; Abbas 
el-Tonsi, who first taught me to pay attention to nuances of language 
structure and meaning; Ahmed Jebari, who .taught me Moroccan without 
teaching-the mark of a truly gifted teacher; Nuha Khoury and Nasser 
Rabbat, who accepted me as a speaker of Levantine Arabic long before 
I (more or less) became one; Ahmed Jebari, Nadia EI-Cheikh, 
Mohammad Abd ai-Karim Taha, and Driss Cherkaoui, who out of 
friendship spent hours on end helping me puzzle through analysis 
problems and rough spots on some very poor quality tapes with the 
kind of dedication to the task that cannot be hired at any price; my 
parents, who let me get on a plane to Cairo twenty years ago; Danny 
AI-Batal, who graciously accepted apologies for missed dinners, trips 
to the park, soccer and basketball games; and Mahmoud, for all of the 
above, and then some.

NOTES ON TRANSCRIPTION AND GLOSSES 
Since the object of this study is the syntactic structure of the 
language, the transcription is more phonemic than phonetic. Hence 
epenthetic vowels are not marked, and short, unstressed vowels are 
often transcribed as schwas. Arabic /wa! (ju/, /w-;)/, /wif) and is usually 
transcribed here as /w/. Non-phonemic emphatic notation (such as /rf) 
is omitted; emphatic IJ/ is marked only in the word /alJah/ God. When 
citing examples from other works, I have adapted the original notation 
to the system used here. The quality of /a/ and /a/ varies a great deal 
across regions; this variation is not reflected in the transcription, except 
for deflection of final /a/ to /e/ in Syrian. Initial glottal stop N is 
marked where clearly pronounced. I have added the often silent /hI of 
Syrian feminine pronoun /hal within brackets for morphological clarity. 
Final vowel length is rarely phonemic in Arabic, and final vowels 
are transcribed without length except in three cases: (a) following 
Cowell (1964), on negating particles /mM and /la/, to distinguish them 
from nominalizer /ma/ and conditional /la/; (b) on /ft/there is, in which 
the length of /if is phonemic (contrasting with /fit in); and (c) in cases 
in which the affixing of an object pronoun to a verb ending in a vowel 
is realized as the lengthening of that vowel (e.g., j§afuj they saw followed 
by /ul him becomes j§affjf they saw him). 
Vowel length in Moroccan is rarely phonemic. Harrell notes that 
vowels are either "short, unstable" or "relatively long, stable" (1962: 10); 
he does not mark vowel length, but rather vowel quality. Caubet 
(1993), on the other hand, marks vowel length. Following the suggestion 
of an anonymous reader of the manuscript, and with the help of Dr. 
Driss Cherkaoui, I have marked a.pproximate vowel length here. 
Moroccan labialized consonants are transcribed with superscript w, as 
in: xW, bW, and mW (on labialization in Moroccan, see Harrell 1962:9-10). 
In the following chart, alternate forms separated by a slash represent 
regional or register variants. A bar underneath a letter signals an 
interdental sound, a dot indicates a velarized (emphatic) sound. Symbols 
leI and Ijl represent affricates, j§/ and /zl fricatives, N is the glottal 
stop, and ɤI and N indicate voiceless and voiced pharyngal fricatives.

Notes on Transcription and Glosses 
Arabic Script 
The use of the Arabic script in transcribing the data is meant to 
serve two purposes: (a) to make the material accessible to Arabic 
speakers not trained in or comfortable with reading phonetic script, and 
(b) to highlight the close relationship among the varieties and registers 
of Arabic by rendering transparent the correspondence between spoken 
and fonnal registers and varieties. Hence I have adhered closely to 
conventions of fonnal Arabic orthography, which do not necessarily 
reflect the phonetic or phonemic values of the utterances. Short vowels 
are marked only as necessary as a pronunciation aid. 
In cases of regular phonetic/phonemic shifts, such as /q/ to N in 
the urban dialects of Egypt and the Levant, fonnal orthography has 
been maintained. In other cases, multiple reflexes of a single phoneme 
coexist within a single dialect (e.g., It I and lsi for standard (.!.» in 
Egyptian and Syrian). Moroccan pronunciation of Iq/ varies regionally 
and lexically. Kuwaiti reflexes of Iql as Ig/ and Ij/, /k/ as /k.1 and Ic/, 
and Ijl as Ijl and Iyl appear to be in a state of flux. In these cases, the 
Arabic symbols used reflect phonetic realization. I have borrowed 
letters for the sounds Ig/ (౿) and Icl (ri) from the Persian script. 
Morphological Glosses 
Due to spatial constraints and the length of many of the examples, 
the morphological translation does not line up vertically with transcribed 
Arabic. However, care has been taken to correlate the two transcription 
layers so that each Arabic word or phrase corresponds to a morphological 
grouping linked by hyphens, and an exact one-to-one correspondence 
has been maintained. Morphological glosses for texts over four lines 
in length have been omitted except where necessary to show grammatical 
structure. Glosses I have added to examples cited from other works are 
in brackets n. 
Morphemic boundaries have not been marked except for the 
definite article (lil-I), because rules for pronouncing lil-I when prefixed 
to certain consonants can sometimes make its presence opaque. Indirect 
objects with preposition /li-/ are transcribed as suffixed to the verb 
phrase when pronounced as part of the verb phrase (as indicated by

stress patterns). Where gender and agreement are not relevant to the 
discussion, he and she refer to human gender, it to non-human singular 
entities. Where gender or number agreement is at issue, I have used 
morphological notation 3ms or 3/s. Non-finite subordinate verbs are 
translated as non-finite: he-go rather than he-goes. (Kuwaiti does not 
make this distinction.) In dialects that use the pair of negative enclitics 
/ma - M, neg has been marked only once. Following the convention of 
Arabists, verbs cited out of context are given in dictionary form, third 
person masculine perfective, and translated as infmitives. 


INTRODUCTION 
Dialectology has been an important part of linguistic research for 
over one hundred years. 1 During this time, it has developed schools 
and methods from quantitative to sociolinguistic, and explored theoretical 
questions on the mechanisms of language change and the nature of 
linguistic variability. Studies involving Arabic dialects have contributed 
to sociolinguistic gender theory (e.g., Haeri 1996), code-switching and 
formal syntax (e.g., Eid 1983, 1991, 1996), and general linguistic theory 
(e.g., Ferguson's [1959b] seminal article "Diglossia," which generated 
an entire field of linguistic inquiry). 
Arabists are fortunate to count among their ranks such energetic 
dialectologists as Behnstedt, Fischer, ]astrow, and Woidich, whose 
extensive studies of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Yemen (among 
others), have exponentially increased our phonological, morphological, 
and lexical knowledge of many areas. However, the picture remains 
far from complete. In addition to vast geographic and social territory 
that has yet to be canvassed, little attention has been paid to comparative 
syntactic data, and even a comparative morphological study is lacking 
(though enough published material for such a study exists). It is true 
that the large geographic area and range of variation among Arabic 
dialects render comparative studies difficult. But Arabic dialectology 
has much to offer linguistic theory precisely for those reasons. The 
wealth of information that may be collected and studied over such a 
large area, a good amount of historical evidence that can be brought to 
bear, as well as increasingly detailed studies on social history, all make 
Arabic a powerful case for testing, proving, and even generating theory. 
Arabic dialectology can also contribute to our understanding of 
formal Arabic? Mitchell and EI-Hassan claim that modality, mood and 
'For an historical overview of the field, see Walters (1988). 
2Arabists use a number of terms to describe the language they study. Classical 
Arabic and Old Arabic refer to early historical periods, Classical to the formal, 
standardized variety and Old Arabic to non-standard registers (see e.g. Fischer 
1995). (By "standardized" I mean following a set of largely prescriptive 
rules.) Middle Arabic refers to non-standard registers that begin to emerge 
early in medieval texts (see Blau 1965, 1966-67; Hopkins 1984). Modern 
Standard Arabic refers to the modem standardized register, and dialects to

Introduction 
aspect must be studied in "the mother-tongue end of the stylistic spectrum 
of conversation" (1994:2). I would argue that the study of all syntactic 
forms should take place there, since subconscious syntactic processing 
is formed through the acquisition of the native tongue, and for Arabic 
speakers, this tongue is their dialect. 
An unfortunate recent trend in certain areas of Arabic linguistics 
has been the continual narrowing of the scope of analysis. During the 
Arabic Linguistics Symposium at Emory University in 1997, one 
presenter disclaimed the validity of his analysis for any Moroccan 
dialects other than "his own." While sociolinguistic questions demand 
a narrow focus and detailed observation, the field is equally in need of 
structural and comparative studies based on a broad spectrum of data. 
Previous Studies in Arabic Dialect Syntax 
The four dialect regions included in the present study are among 
the best-documented with both grammars and published texts. Of these, 
the best analyses of structure, and those that pay most attention to 
semantics and pragmatics, are Cowell's Reference Grammar of Syrian 
Arabic (1 964) and Harrell's Short Reference Grammar of Moroccan 
Arabic ( 1 962), both of which are mainly descriptive in approach, yet 
attempt to discover semantic and pragmatic explanations of syntactic 
structures. Each has many important observations about the dialect it 
treats. Caubet's (1993) detailed grammar of Moroccan, with particular 
attention to Fez and the surrounding region, is particularly welcome 
addition. Caubet takes a functional approach to the syntax of Moroccan, 
parallel in many ways to the approach used here. Her analyses, as well 
as inclusion of the texts from which she drew her examples, make her 
study a valuable contribution to the field. 
Egypt is also well-represented in the literature. The teaching 
grammars of Mitchell (1956) and el-Tonsi (1 982) provide information 
on the speech of the Cairo, and Khalafallah ( 1969) treats the Arabic 
spoken in Upper Egypt. Behnstedt and Woidich's (1985, 1988, 1994) 
spoken varieties and registers. Educated Spoken Arabic refers to a formal 
register of spoken Arabic that combines both spoken and formal features. I 
take these labels to represent points along a linguistic continuum of varieties 
(e.g., dialects and historical periods) and registers (from formal or written to 
informal or spoken), terms I will use here. 

Previous Studies in Arabic Dialect Syntax

multi-volume study of Egyptian Arabic offers an excellent range of 
text data covering almost all of Egypt, and focusing on rural dialects. 
Woidich has published extensively on Egyptian (1968, 1 975, 1980a,b), 
and Eisele ( 1 988, 1990a,b), Eid ( 1 983), and others have contributed 
studies on particular aspects of syntax. 
The Syrian area is rich in dialect variation, much of which is 
well-documented in work of Behnstedt (1989, 1990), Cantineau (1946), 
Cowell (1964), Grotzfeld (1965), and Lewin ( 1966). Less is available 
on the rural dialects of the northwestern and coastal regions, but Feghali's 
(1928) study of the syntax of Lebanese includes interesting data taken 
from rural speech. 
While descriptions of the Gulf dialects as a group are continually 
expanding, the pool of data remains small, and few recorded texts from 
this region have been published. Qafisheh ( 1 975) and Holes ( 1990) 
provide a good deal of infonnation on Gulf Arabic, but contain no 
texts, and Holes' grammar follows the fonn of a reply to general cross­
linguistic questionnaire rather than a study of problems particular to 
Arabic. AI-Ma<tOq's (1986) study of the dialect of the Kuwaiti <Ajman 
tribe is based on data including poetry and proverbs, rendering it less 
than ideal for syntactic study, and al-Najjar's ( 1984) dissertation on 
aspect in Kuwaiti is based on composed sentences. 
Although Ingham's ( 1994) study of Najdi Arabic falls outside the 
geographic bounds of this study, three factors have motivated attention 
to his work here: _ first, the Kuwaiti dialect is Najdi in origin (the ruling 
elite of Kuwait migrated from the Najd over two hundred years ago; 
'Abo I:Iakima 1984:22). Second, his study fills a number of gaps left 
by previously published grammars, particularly in the realm of syntax. 
Information provided by Ingham for Najdi has been an important 
supplement to the rather scarce data available on Kuwaiti syntax. Finally, 
Ingham's analyses of certain aspects of nominal and verbal syntax have 
been quite helpful in fonnulating some of the cross-dialect analyses 
offered here. 
Previous comparative studies of syntactic aspects of spoken Arabic 
have focused on discrete aspects of the language, and in some cases the 
analysis remains highly dependent on Classical Arabic structure (e.g., 
Rosenhouse 1 978). Two studies use published data to provide a 

4 
Introduction 
comparison of one particular construction in every recorded Arabic 
dialect: Haming (1980) compares genitive constructions and the genitive 
construct (Arabic /i<;lafal), and Retso ( 1983) compares passive verb 
morphology. Mitchell and EI-Hassan's (1994) study of mood and aspect 
in the educated spoken Arabic of Egypt and the Levant provides a 
wealth of data on the verbal system across several registers of Arabic. 
Much of the work on the syntax of individual dialects takes as its 
theoretical framework generative grammar, based largely on artificially 
generated sentences devoid of context.3 This approach has not been 
adopted here, for reasons explained below. 
Scope and Aims of the Present Study 
Following dialectology in general, Arabic dialect studies have 
focused on and recorded in some detail the phonological, morphological, 
and lexical characteristics of individual dialects across most of the 
Arab world, thus laying the groundwork for comparative studies on 
those levels. 
Also following the trends of dialectology in general, 
syntax has received considerably less attention than phonology and the 
lexicon. I have chosen to focus on syntax precisely because it remains 
one of the least-studied areas of spoken Arabic. 
Mitchell and EI-Hassan, directors of the Leeds project on Educated 
Spoken Arabic in Egypt and the Levant, note that U[r]egional differences 
are lexical (and phonological) before they are grammatical" ( 1994:2). 
The present study bears out that observation to a great extent, even on 
a broader (though more shallow) scale. Nevertheless, such regional 
differences can potentially provide insight into the synchronic range of 
variation in spoken Arabic and point to areas of possible diachronic 
developments. 
Anecdotal evidence lends some support to the view that syntax 
constitutes a more stable facet of language than either phonology or the 
lexicon. At the University of Damascus, I met a fourth-year student 
from an 'Alawite region near Lattakia living in Damascus to attend 
school. 
This speaker easily adjusted her phonology and lexicon to

on Arabic Linguistics (John Benjamins Publishing Co., 1990-), which publishes 
papers from the annual Symposia on Arabic Linguistics in the United States.

Damascene norms, substituting /'I for her native /q/, for example, but 
on two occasions, I noticed her use of a particular syntactic construction 
not usually heard in Damascene speech: a syntactically embedded 
perfective verb. In the first example cited below, the speaker employs 
perfective /r-;)-;)t/ I went rather than the expected (according to urban 
norms) non-finite, unmarked imperfective form /rOl)/ I go. In the second, 
she uses perfective /kammalt/ I finished in place of the unmarked 
imperfective /kammilha/ I finish it. Both sentences contain Damascene 
/'I rather than 'Alawite /q/ on /'alb/ heart and /,idirt/ I was able.

What is important about this example is that it demonstrates the relative 
ease with which she accomplished phonological and lexical substitution, 
as opposed to the more difficult syntactic substitution. The speaker has 
substituted /'I for /q/, and the verb /,idir/ to be able to for her native /fi-/ 
to be able to (lit., to be "in" someone to [do something)), but has failed 
to make the corresponding syntactic modification involving shifting 
from using the pertective with /fi-/ to the wunarked imperfective required 
by /'idir/. If it is true that syntactic change tends to proceed more 
slowly than phonological and lexical change, then evidence of syntactic 
variation in the dialects may provide an additional perspective for 
diachronic studies. 
This project aims to compare the syntax of geographically diverse 
varieties of spoken Arabic. Time constraints limited the scope to four 
dialect regions, and Morocco, Egypt, Syria, and Kuwait, were chosen 
as representative of four distinct dialect groupS.4 The study takes as a

Introduction 
second goal contributing to the theoretical base of Arabic linguistics 
through the application of functional approaches to syntax. Pragmatics, 
discourse analysis, and functional typology all yield important theoretical 
tools that have yet to be exploited in the study of Arabic dialects. At 
the same time, this study aims to bring a more nuanced description of 
spoken Arabic syntax to typologists who have, for the most part, had to 
rely on grammars of formal Arabic and the impressions of native speakers 
for information. For example, in his cross-linguistic study on tense, 
Comrie assumes that the dialects agree with Modem Standard as against 
Classical Arabic, citing personal communication with an Egyptian 
colleague and his own work on Maltese for dialects (1985:63). Finally, 
as a perpetual student of Arabic, I hope to provide fellow students with 
a description of the structure of spoken Arabic that will aid them in 
acquiring fluency in the language as well as the ability to move from 
dialect to dialect. 
This book is thus addressed to Arabists, students of Arabic, and 
general linguists. With the goal of rendering the analysis accessible to 
all these audiences, I have attempted to keep technical vocabulary to a 
minimum. A basic knowledge of either Arabic or linguistics has been 
assumed; where the syntax of spoken Arabic differs significantly from 
that of the formal register, references have also been provided to the 
grammars of Wright ( 1 898), which, over one hundred years after 
publication, remains one of the most comprehensive descriptions of 
Classical Arabic available in English, and to Cantarino's ( 1975) syntax 
of modem formal Arabic. 
Approaches to the Study of Syntax 
The primary objective of this study is to compare and contrast 
syntactic features in Moroccan, Egyptian, Syrian, and Kuwaiti Arabic. 
The question implicitly asked by such a study, to what extent does the 
syntax of these dialects differ, is not easily answered, for it depends not 
only on what one is looking for, or the particular features being compared, 
but also on how one goes about looking for it, that is, the kind of 
linguistic analysis applied. In the course of examining the data corpus, 
the need arose for an analytic framework capable of explaining the 
kinds of language variation found in spoken Arabic. Thus it became 

Approaches to the Study of Syntax 
7 
necessary to expand the primary goal of the study to include the outline 
such a framework. 
The two main methodological approaches to the study of syntax 
contrast in methodology and approach. Formal syntax concerns itself 
solely with language form, and seeks to construct a universal grammar 
hard-wired into the human brain. The various schools of functional 
syntax, on the other hand, accord attention to language meaning. I 
have chosen a functional framework, combining typological, discourse­
based, and pragmatic approaches. These approaches seek principles 
and strategies of information packaging that appear to be common to 
human language in general or to a large number of language families 
across the globe. Discourse and pragmatic studies also provide the 
tools necessary to address questions of the meanings underlying language 
variation. 
One of the assumptions underlying this study is that syntactic 
variation is not random or "free," but that it occurs according to semantic, 
pragmatic, or sociolinguistic principles, and that the search for these 
principles constitutes an important goal of syntactic description. The 
documentation of linguistic variation is necessary for obvious reasons, 
but an equally important goal is to explain the variation in meaning as 
well, to the extent possible. It follows from the assumption of the 
non-randomness of variation that the speaker has some degree of control 
over the structures she or he uses. Accordingly, I attempt here to 
identify the syntactic areas in which the speaker faces choices of 
"information packaging." In choosing one form over another, speakers 
present information in a certain way for a particular reason. In exploring 
these choices, I have found it helpful to include consideration of data 
that at first appear to be performance errors, mistakes or "slips of the 
tongue" on the part of the speaker. Formal approaches to syntax dismiss 
them as human imperfection, mere imperfect renderings of the (implied) 
perfect system. In some cases, however, these errors open a window to 
underlying pragmatic choices the speaker is making. 
Why should a study of spoken Arabic syntax involve pragmatics? 
Giv6n claims that "there are reasons to believe that every language has 
a wide range of discourse registers, from the loose-informal-pragmatic 
to the tight-formal-syntactic" (1979a:21O). Giv6n labels the two extremes 

8 
Introduction 
of this continuum the pragmatic mode and the syntactic mode. (Giv6n 
does not formulate this view in terms of a continuum; in fact, he uses 
the word "dichotomy" [ 1979a:98], but his "range of discourse registers" 
reflects an underlying structural continuum.) Grammars of formal Arabic 
provide information on Giv6n's "tight-formal-syntactic" end of the 
spectrum; here I investigate the opposite end. Since spoken Arabic 
corresponds to the loose-informal-pragmatic end of the spectrum, it 
follows that pragmatic principles may be better equipped to explain the 
kind of variation found in the dialects. 
One problem with the view that the grammar of a language consists 
of sets of rules is that a speaker's grammar is never complete, but 
always evolving. 
Rules of grammar can never be exhaustively 
documented, because they vary over time and in different sociolinguistic 
contexts. Therefore, it is important to explore the kinds of pragmatic 
principles that account for the existence and use of variant syntactic 
forms. Harris' ( 1984) study of Irish English syntax lends further support 
to the choice of functional approach. Harris has shown that non-standard 
language varieties cannot always be analyzed successfully as surface 
structure variants of an underlying grammar, and that "account may 
have to be taken not only of possible syntactic constraints at the level 
of clause structure, but also of much wider semantic, discourse and 
ultimately pragmatic considerations" (Harris 1984: 3 16).5 
Much cross-linguistic work in the area of functional approaches 
to grammar (e.g., Hopper and Thompson 1980, Li 1977, Li and Thompson 
1976, 198 1 ,  Timberlake 1977, and Wald 1983), and many of the concepts 
developed by these linguists, are quite applicable to the study of spoken 
Arabic. In searching for a way to efficiently describe and explain the 
syntactic variation of Arabic as it is used by native speakers, the 
methodology that I have adopted is simply to synthesize those concepts 
that are able to most efficiently account for the actual data. 
I also assume, following Palmer, that "even at the formal level, 
grammaticalisation is a matter of degree, of 'more or less' rather than 
SHarris' analysis of Irish equivalents to Standard English perfect verbs 
concludes that Irish English uses five forms to cover the semantic range of the 
one Standard English form, and proposes four semantic categories that detail 
the specific differences.

'yes or no'" ( 1986:4-5). What I understand him to mean is that syntax 
often involves soft choices rather than hard rules; that is, the speaker's 
own internal grammar is not structured entirely in categories, but includes 
continua as well, and this grammar allows him or her a great degree of 
control in how he or she presents information to his or her interlocutor. 
While sociolinguistic studies have for years recognized the centrality 
of speaker control to the use of language, this point of view has received 
less attention in syntactic studies of spoken Arabic (Belnap 1 99 1  being 
one notable exception). Holes ( 1 983) and Haeri ( 1996) show that the 
speaker controls phonological variables in a communicative way; this 
view of speaker control can and should be extended to the syntactic 
level as well. 
Pragmatic principles of information packaging are more or less 
available to the speakers in the same way that formal rules are. The 
sociolinguistic model for communicative competence in code switching 
can be used to describe speakers' competence in syntactic form-switching 
according to a pragmatic competence. In code-switching, speakers 
negotiate their identities and relationships to the social contexts of 
speech events. In choosing among syntactic variants, speakers negotiate 
the mapping of a linguistic system of representation onto the real world, 
in which things are rarely black and white. 
This approach also provides a useful model for linguistic change 
on the syntactic level, since the reinterpretation of the pragmatics of 
choice may be responsible for change in the choice of form. 
Grammaticalization studies have shown that diachronic syntactic change 
can take place through shift in pragmatic meaning (Traugott and Konig 
1991). For diachronic reconstruction, tracing change in function is as 
important as tracing change in form. 
This view find itself at odds with formal approaches to syntax. 
In their introduction to generative syntax, Green and Morgan stress that 
[tJhe essence of .. . formal syntax ... is that principles of syntax 
have to do just with matters of linguistic form, and are independent 
(in the mind, hence also in the correct theory) of matters of 
meaning or communicative function (1996:5). 
Formal syntax lacks the tools to address the kinds of questions asked 
here, questions about the variation in meaning and function that I assume 

10 
Introduction 
to underlie variation in fonn. Moreover, the highly specialized technical 
tenninology of fonnal syntax renders it difficult for the lay reader to 
understand. The vast differences that separate the aims of generative 
syntax from the aims of this study preclude reference to generative and 
post-generative syntactic theory here. 
While this presentation assumes a basic knowledge of Arabic 
structure on the part of non-linguist readers, formal Arabic syntax is 
not taken as framework for analysis for several reasons. First, most 
grammars of fonnal Arabic do not provide an appropriate model for a 
functional study of the syntax of spoken Arabic, because they focus on 
the desinential inflection system.6 Second, the goal here is to describe 
the syntactic patterns found in the dialects without reference to a 
prescriptive nonn. A number of Arabists have assumed that the dialects 
have descended from or developed out of Classical Arabic (e.g., Blau 
1965, 1966-67, Blanc 1970, Harning 1980), but I agree with Fischer 
(1995) that the modern dialects represent descendents of older dialects. 
It follows from this assumption that any attempt to reconstruct a history 
of spoken Arabic should begin with as thorough as possible a description 
of the present. Occasional reference is made to Classical Arabic syntax 
only to point out previously unnoted points of comparison with spoken 
Arabic. 
Shortcomings of this Approach 
Among the problems of balancing cross-linguistic theory with a 
description of Arabic is that attempting to give the two somewhat equal 
weight has led to the inevitable result that neither area is satisfactorily 
addressed. This study may with fairness be accused of downplaying 
the range of syntactic variety in spoken Arabic. The attempt to create a 
framework for a comparative functional study has imposed a somewhat 
greater degree of attention to shared patterns than to individual cases of 
variation. In seeking solutions to certain syntactic problems, I have at 
times taken the liberty of using evidence from one or two dialects to 
generalize to all dialects, and then sought supporting evidence in the 
6But see Moutaouakil (1989) for a functional analysis of modern formal 
Arabic. 

Approaches to the Study of Syntax 
1 1  
others where possible. While I have tried to avoid the trap of theory 
dictating results, it has been helpful to propose some generalizations 
where they seem warranted. 
The practical goal of this study is to present a comparative overview 
that accounts for a range of actual data, even if that overview emerges 
at the expense of a more detailed inventory of forms. Here economy 
takes precedence over exhaustive description, in the hope that a "lowest 
common denominator" framework can be established within which to 
explore, in future research, a more detailed inventory. This approach 
differs from that of studies of particular dialects or regions, which aim 
to document and describe the complete range data found. Perhaps a 
combination of approaches will lead us eventually to the best possible 
analyses. 
The quality, quantity, and range of data presented here falls far 
short of ideal for proving the analyses proposed. Only as this study 
progressed did certain gaps in the data become clear, and temporal and 
spatial constraints have ended the search at this point. In a number of 
instances, the analyses are qualified with calls for further research and 
more contextualized data. 
The arguments presented here tend, at times, to be somewhat 
circular: in certain cases, analyses are proposed and then used to 
support each other. Many of them cannot be proved at this point. 
However, most of them find precedence in hypotheses generated and 
substantiated by typological and cross-linguistic analyses. In other 
cases they represent guesses, presented here as hypotheses with a plea 
for further testing and revision-or discarding. If they prove to be 
wrong, then they will have contributed in their own way to our 
understanding of Arabic. 
Shortcomings notwithstanding, I hope that the present study can 
provide a basis for further work, both in expanding the scope of the 
picture with more data from more dialects, and in providing a theoretical 
framework within which to ask more sophisticated and detailed questions. 
Finally, it is necessary to stress that this study includes, but does 
not represent, varieties of Arabic spoken with the borders of four 
geopolitical entities. Obviously, no linguistic map would match these 
boundaries, and terms such as "Moroccan dialect" and Syrian dialect" 

12 
Introduction 
do not in any sense reflect an actual linguistic situation. As Penny 
argues,7 the term dialect implies discontinuity, a sharp or sudden 
transition in features that does not reflect the gradual, continuous nature 
of linguistic variation. The word "dialect" appears here merely as a 
convenient label for a heterogeneous group of varieties of Arabic. 
The Data 
This study is data-driven: the collection and examination of the 
basic corpus of data preceded decisions on theoretical approach. I 
began by taking notes on features and structures that emerged as 
unexpected, contrasting across dialects, or in need of description, and 
then I went in search of theory that seemed to describe or explain the 
phenomena that caught my attention. 
The analyses offered herein are based on data collected from 
three sources: (a) tape-recorded data I collected from informants in 
Morocco, Syria, Kuwait, and Egypt; (b) commercial tape recordings of 
plays and interviews from these countries; and (c) published texts and 
studies. I have sought and used elicited data only as a last resort, in the 
final stages of documentation. Circumstances have imposed several 
limitations on the study. The data I collected are scattered at best, and 
do not fully represent any of these dialect regions. I had only three 
months of fieldwork in each country, scarcely time to carry out extensive 
interviewing. The quantity of my Egyptian and Kuwaiti data ended up 
being rather less than that of Moroccan and Syrian data. While informant 
data includes a range of sociolinguistic backgrounds (see Appendix 1), 
the amount of data collected from speakers with at least a high-school 
education outweighs that collected from lesser- or uneducated ones. 
The study reflects a marked urban bias, and few rural and no bedouin 
dialects are represented. 
The body of data I collected consists of recordings and field 
notes I wrote down while observing spontaneous conversations. The 
recordings consist of both semi-formal interviews and free conversations; 
topic choice was left to circumstance. Whenever possible, I left the

interviewing and conversing to native speakers, with the aim of 
minimizing interference from my non-native speech patterns, especially 
in Morocco and Kuwait. Many of the Moroccan interviews and 
conversations were recorded with the help of Ahmed Jebari, and the 
folktales from a rural region near Meknas were collected through the 
auspices of an American friend who had lived in the community for 
over a year and spoke the local dialect fluently. Much of my Kuwaiti 
data comes from two long formal interviews conducted by Kuwaiti 
folklorist Mariam al-'Agrouga, to which I was merely an observer. 
Appendix 2 contains excerpts from representative texts from each region. 
When I have needed additional information or assistance in 
puzzling out pragmatics, I have used Lebanese, Gulf, and Najdi grammars 
and data as supplements to the grammars of the dialects examined 
here. Justification for including information from these neighboring 
regions is three-fold. First, national boundaries do not represent linguistic 
ones, and shifts in speech patterns take place gradually. Second, the 
supplementary material I have used comes from dialects or communities 
closely related to those under study here: Lebanon and Syria have only 
recently been separated politically, and Kuwaitis originally came from 
the Najd. Third, the point of limiting the study to these particular 
dialect areas was simply that I could not hope to examine all features in 
all dialects at this point. During later stages of this project, personal 
circumstances have given me full-time access to a linguistically 
sophisticated Beiruti informant; where I have sought his judgements I 
refer to Lebanese rather than Syrian. 
Contents of the Study 
Reference grammars are available for all the dialects investigated 
here; thus, this book is not meant to be a description or inventory of the 
grammar(s) of these dialects. It also falls short of a complete inventory 
of syntactic structures, and it does not claim to include the full range of 
variation within each dialect region. The syntactic features for this 
study have been chosen either for their theoretical or comparative interest, 
or because the data I have collected is not satisfactorily documented or 
explained by the existing grammars.

Introduction 
The ten chapters that comprise this study fall into three broad 
categories: nominal syntax, verbal syntax, and sentence typology. 
Nominal Syntax 
Nominal syntax in Arabic presents a number of features of interest 
to Arabists, language typologists, discourse analysts, and dialectologists. 
These features include definiteness, relativization, demonstratives, 
number agreement, and genitive and possessive constructions. Spoken 
and written registers of Arabic all share basic morphological and syntactic 
properties: 
the definite article I-I/, the obligatory agreement of the 
noun and modifying adjectives in definiteness, the construct or liQafa/, 
also called the genitive construct, and relative clause structure. Most 
forms of spoken Arabic share the relative pronoun lilIi! and a number 
agreement system that allows feminine singular verb and adjective 
agreement with plural nouns, and each dialect has one or more genitive 
exponents that coexist with the genitive construct. It seems that the 
dialects share the same basic properties of nominal syntax. However, 
each of these syntactic structures has a particular question or questions 
associated with it, due to the fact that previous analyses cannot account 
for certain data, and because the tendency to rely on morphological 
markers to describe syntactic behavior results in an incomplete picture, 
especially of spoken Arabic. 
It is argued here that, in order to 
satisfactorily explain the problematic data, account must be taken of 
the pragmatic and discourse roles that nouns play. The picture that 
emerges within this kind of framework supports the hypothesis that the 
native speaker's internalized grammar consists not only of rules and 
categories but also of principles and continua that the speaker utilizes 
to express subtleties of meaning. 
The first four chapters of the book explore various aspects of 
nominal syntax. Chapter 1 examines the various definite and indefinite 
articles that modify nouns, and shows that the traditional treatment of 
articles as either definite or indefinite cannot satisfactorily account for 
their meaning and distribution in the dialects. 
As an alternative, a 
continuum of definiteness and a hierarchy of individuation are adopted 
to account for the use of articles across dialects. Chapter 2 uses the 
hierarchy of individuation to account for certain patterns of number

agreement of plural nouns in the dialects, and look briefly at the 
pragmatics of possessive constructions, contrasting the construct (Jic;lafa/) 
and the functions of the genitive exponents or possessive adjectives 
that express the periphrastic genitive (ldyal/, /hitac/, /tabac/, and /mal/). 
Chapter 3 explores the structures and strategies of relativization across 
the four dialect areas. Finally, Chapter 4 examines syntactic and discourse 
roles of commonly occurring demonstrative articles and pronouns. 
Verbal Syntax 
Any discussion of the verbal system of a language must take into 
account a number of morphosyntactic categories and semantic properties 
that most human languages share, such as tense, aspect, and mood. 
However, these categories overlap and interact in ways that are not yet 
fully understood, and differ in their realization in each language so 
widely that they defy universal definition and description. Mood and 
aspect are used in different senses and are grammaticalized in some 
cases and lexicalized in others, and tense, a morphological category, 
intersects with time reference without overlapping entirely. Moreover, 
aspect, mood and time reference are all features that operate at the 
sentence level as well as the verb phrase level, interacting with each 
other and with other sentential elements such as objects and adverbs, as 
well as the speech context. 
The meanings of the verbal forms in Arabic, whether Classical 
or modem, formal or spoken, have long been the subject of debate 
among Arabists and linguists.8 The questions most frequently addressed 
include: (1) Do the Arabic perfective and imperfective verb forms 
represent aspectual or temporal forms? and (2) What is the temporal 
and/or aspectual nature of the participle? Previous scholarship on tense 
and aspect in Arabic has been summarized by Eisele, who classifies the 
literature in two camps: (1) the 'aspectualists,' who claim that the 
perfective and imperfective are aspectual in nature and not temporal, 
and (2) the 'tense-aspectualists,' who contend (often vaguely) that these 
verb forms combine both temporal and aspectual natures (1988:8-36). 
8Participants in the tense-aspect debate include Comrie (1976, 1 985), 
Kurylowicz (1973), McCarus (1976), Fleisch (1974), and especially Eisele 
(1988), who reviews this scholarship in detail.

Introduction 
Eisele cites a lack of attention paid by aspectualists to the role of tense 
in the dialects; other literature tends to dismiss the role of aspect in the 
verbal system of spoken Arabic (e.g., Comrie 1 985:63). However, 
both views seem to be based largely on intuition, since no comparative 
studies have yet been undertaken. While most previous studies are 
concerned with the theoretical meanings of verb forms at the sentence 
level, the focus here is on the use of verb forms in larger discourse 
contexts taken from natural data. 
Studies of tense and aspect in Arabic have received so many 
different definitions and treatments that it is difficult to find consensus 
even on terminology. While 1 have tried to avoid adding to the confusion, 
it has been necessary to use terminology that reflects the analysis proposed 
here, even when that terminology differs from that of other studies. In 
analyzing the verb system, I have substituted pel/ective and imperfective 
for the traditional terms peifect and imperfect, because I use the term 
pel/eel to refer to an aspect that 1 argue is expressed by the participle. 
Chapters 5 through 8 treat various aspects of verbal syntax. It is 
here that the four dialects show at once the greatest similarity and the 
greatest variation. Chapter 5 presents an overview of verb categories, 
with particular attention to pseudo-verbs and other types of verbs whose 
syntactic behavior and function set them apart from "typical" verbs. 
Chapter 6 deals with the aspectual nature of the morphological forms 
of the Arabic verb, joining the chorus of voices that agree with Mitchell 
and El-Hassan, among others, that "Arabic has two tenses, which refer 
only tenuously to temporal distinctions" ( 1994: 13). Here evidence is 
presented that aspect plays a greater role than time reference in 
determining the choice of verb form used, particularly in narrative 
contexts. 1 also argue for the aspectual, atemporal nature of the participle, 
and that participles function in the same manner across all four dialect 
regions. Chapter 7 explores the nature of tense and time reference in 
spoken Arabic as seen in data from the four dialects, and points to the 
importance of "relative tense" to time reference in spoken Arabic. A 
group of verbs called "temporal verbs" is examined here as well. 
Temporal verbs form a functionally distinct group in that their main 
role is to set the temporal frame of reference for the event or proposition, 
and they also share certain syntactic behavior patterns across dialects.

Chapter 8 contrasts the morphological mood markers of the dialects, 
and examines the interaction of mood and aspect in conditional sentences. 
Sentence Typology 
The last two chapters explore aspects of sentence-level syntax 
and the information packaging strategies that appear to govern negation 
and word order. Chapter 9 examines patterns of negation across dialects, 
with particular attention to the pragmatics of negative sentences. The 
dialects are shown to share three main negating strategies, as well as a 
"negative copula." Negation is unusual among the syntactic structures 
examined here in that it provides the only case of a single syntactic 
isogloss separating geographic regions. Hence negation provides 
evidence of contact and borrowing in a way few other syntactic features 
do. Chapter 10 discusses word-order typology in the dialects. The 
order of the constituent parts of a clause or sentence is one of the most 
basic components of syntax, and has been a major concern of linguists 
regardless of their methodological frameworks. The goal of some 
approaches is to formulate grammar rules in terms of changes in word 
order, a practice which is best suited to languages that have a fairly 
fixed word order, such as English, in which "many syntactic processes 
can be described in terms of changes in linear order" (Comrie 198 1 :219). 
However, such an approach is less suited to languages with more flexible 
order, such as Arabic. A number of previous studies of spoken Arabic 
have concluded that the order of sentence elements is "variable.,,9 The 
word order of main sentence constituents plays little part in syntactic 
processes in Arabic; minimally constrained in Classical Arabic, it retains 
the same flexibility in the modem dialects. Chapter 10 analyzes word 
order patterns according to theories of information structure, and 
demonstrate some of the ways in which pragmatic considerations 
influence the variable order of sentential elements that is characteristic 
of all forms of Arabic. 
9 See e.g. Grand'Henry (1976:85) and Rosenhouse (1984:49). Caubet's (1993) 
Moroccan grammar provides a welcome exception to this trend, offering a 
detailed functional analysis of word order variation in Moroccan. 

1 THE DEFINITENESS CONTINUUM 
1.0 
Introduction 
It is increasingly recognized that, in natural language, many 
grammatical features such as definiteness, number and animacy interact 
with each other, and behave more like continua than like strictly delimited 
categories (Comrie 198 1 ,  Giv6n 1979a, Croft 1990). In Arabic, nouns 
are said to be either definite or indefinite, but this dichotomy imperfectly 
represents the real world, in which entities can be more or less definite 
and specific. Natural language data from spoken Arabic in all four 
dialect areas contain entities that are neither wholly definite nor wholly 
indefinite, but rather lie somewhere in between, in an area that may be 
called 'indefinite-specific.' In this chapter, I will argue that speakers of 
Arabic exercise a degree of control in manipulating the rules of syntax 
to try to approximate these shades of meaning. This control allows 
speakers the flexibility they need to more closely describe the continuum 
of definiteness that the natural world presents. 
1.1 
Definite and Indefinite Markers 
Definiteness in Arabic seems, at first glance, to be quite 
straightforward. Prescriptive and descriptive grammars alike describe 
the system of definiteness and indefiniteness as dichotomous: nouns 
are either definite or indefinite, and proper nouns are definite whether 
or not they are marked by the definite article. Nouns can be made 
definite with the addition of the definite article /(i)l-/, or by the 
specification of a noun by the addition of another substantive to it to 
form a possessive construct Ui<;iafa/). In all of the dialects examined 
here, the definite article is /{i)l-/ or a phonetically determined variant. 
The following examples demonstrate:

In addition to the definite article, several of these dialects make 
use of other articles. Moroccan and Syrian employ the partie Ie ff,i/ 
some, and all four dialects permit limited use of the article /wal}id/ 
(Moroccan /wal}Vd I-I) one (f /wal}dal). 
In Moroccan, Harrell ( 1962) notes two "indefinite" articles: a 
"concretizing" article /wal}Vd 1-/ one, and a "potential" article ff,i/ some 
( 1962: 147, 1 89). Examples of these articles from my data include:

Syrian Arabic shares with Moroccan the article /Ui/, although 
Cowell classifies Syrian ff,i/ as a partitive noun rather than an article 
( 1964:467). Syrian speakers also use /wal}id/ (f /wal}de/ (Grotzfeld 
1965:76), primarily with human nouns. Examples of both /Ui/ and 
/wiiQid/ from my data include:

Holes notes the use of /wa!:tid/ in Gulf Arabic preceding a noun 
to mean a certain (1990: 1 14). My Kuwaiti data contain several examples 
in which /wa!:tid/ modifies human nouns, including: 
K3 
tી .,.,.1.J ..s... ..:..:0.1.)

went-she to one religious-man 
She went to a learned religious man 
While the grammars of these dialects 'vary widely in their treatment 
of 1Si/ and /wa!:tid/, the recurrence of these articles across dialects invites 
comparative study of them. What is the motivation for marking nouns 
in these ways? What pragmatic role(s) do they play? Harrell's descriptive 
names, "concretizing" and "potential," allude to the fact that /wiil)Kd 1-/ 
and lsi! fulfill particular discourse functions, which may now be further 
specified and defined in light of developments in discourse theory in 
the years since Harrell wrote. 
The traditional definite/indefinite dichotomy does not leave room 
to account for the function of these articles. Why do the dialects need 
"indefinite" articles such as lSi! and /wa!:tid/ if the unmodified noun is 
also indefinite? The contexts of the sentences cited above show that 

1.2 Definiteness, Indefiniteness, and Specification 
21 
the "indefinite" articles !W and /wa1:Iid/ are in fact not wholly indefmite. 
Why are they used in some cases and not in others? Why does /wa1:Iid/ 
modify only human nouns? Answers to these questions may be found 
in typological and pragmatic approaches to syntax. 
1.2 
Definiteness, Indefiniteness, and Specification 
Chafe gives a good description of 'definite' status: "I think you 
know and can identify the thing I have in mind" ( 1 976:39). In other 
words, in order for a nominal phrase to assume defmite status in discourse, 
it must meet one of several conditions: (a) it must have been previously 
mentioned in t!le discourse; or (b) it must be a member of a universal 
set of entities, such as the sun, that can be assumed to be known and 
identifiable without further specification, or (c) the speaker must have 
good reason to think that the entity is retrievable by the listener through 
knowledge shared by the interlocutors (Chafe 1976). Pragmatically, a 
definite noun usually represents given information, or information that 
has already been established in the discourse or can be assumed by the 
speaker to be present or active in the mind of his or her interlocutor. 
An indefinite noun, then, does not meet any of the above conditions, 
and represents an unknown, irretrievable entity. 
However, not all indefinite nouns are created equal. Medieval 
Arab grammarians called the grammatical specification of nouns !tax'ijI'ij/ 
specifying. 
Wright notes that /tax'ijI'ij! includes modification of an 
indefinite noun by adjectival phrases and annexation ( l898ii: 198). A 
Lebanese encyclopedia on Arabic grammar defines it thus:

• 
Specification is the lessening of the commonality that occurs in 
indefinite entities, and [this] may occur through modification or 
the genitive (lierMa{), such as: He is a man of learning, as the 
addition of 'man' to 'learning' has lessened the indefiniteness of 
[the former], because if we say, He is a man, [the statement] is 
general, but if we say, He is a man of learning, we will have 
eliminated from it some of that generality (al-Tunji and al-'Asmar 
1993:156). 

22 
The Definiteness Continuum 
The principle of partial specification of nouns is thus not new to the 
description of Arabic. Nor is it new to language typology. Croft calls 
it referentiality, and formalizes this definiteness hierarchy (1990: 1 16): 
Hierarchy of definiteness 
definite 
referential indefinite 
nonreferential indefinite 
Croft's term referential indefinite describes al-TOnji and al-Asmar's 
phrase a man of learning, and his nonreferential indefinite describes 
their nonspecific noun a man. 
Khan's work on Semitic provides a good model to use in the 
analysis of nominal syntax in spoken Arabic. Khan (1984) has adapted 
the work of Chafe ( 1976), Timberlake ( 1977), Hopper and Thompson 
( 1980), and others to show that one or more of the features listed in 
Table 1-1 may operate to attract object marking and agreement pronouns 
in Semitic, such that the more individuated the noun, the greater the 
tendency of these markers to occur. He groups these qualities together 
under a rubric he calls individuation or salience, which he illustrates as 
follows (1984:470): 
Table 1-1: Khan's Hierarchies of Individuation 
Individuated/Salient 
1. Definite 
2. Non-reflexive 
3. Specific

The notion of individuation provides great explanatory power for 
the syntactic behavior of nouns in spoken Arabic. However, I will 
modify Khan's framework slightly to include those features that most 
influence the syntactic behavior of nouns in spoken Arabic. Reflexivity, 
while relevant to the individuation of nouns, is often expressed in 
Arabic through verb morphology. And since abstract nouns in Arabic 

1.2 Definiteness, Indefiniteness, and Specification 
23 
normally take the definite article, concreteness appears to have less 
central a role than specification and qualification in the syntactic marking 
of nouns. Parallel to Khan's textual prominence is physical prominence: 
nouns tend to be marked as more salient when they are present in the 
immediate environment (see further 4.2). Three other modifications 
are inspired by and adapted from the work of Cowell and Janda. 
First, I will add to the list the feature quantification. Cowell 
contrasts agreement patterns of nouns denoting "collectivity or 
generality" with those denoting "heterogeneity or particularity" 
(1964:423). Belnap's study of number agreement in Cairene Arabic 
lends further support to this analysis ( 1 99 1  :68-72). Quantification 
involving numbers ten and lower also appears to have some relevance 
to the marking of new discourse topics (see 1 .5). 
Cowell also contrasts concepts of identification and classification, 
which play a role in the expression of possessive constructions. 
Identificatory annexion refers to the assigning of an entity to a specific 
possessor, while classificatory annexion assigns an entity to a set or 
group (1964:458). This notion of a proper identification contrasted to 
a generic one parallels Khan's hierarchy of specificity vs. genericness, 
and Khan's terms specific and generic are defined here to include Cowell's 
insight. 
Finally, I will add to Khan's animacy hierarchy the concept of 
agency, defined here as the degree to which an individual or entity has 
the ability to act independently. Agency may be viewed as a kind of 
sociolinguistic parallel to textual prominence. 
The concept finds 
precedence in the work of linguists who have argued for the role of 
social status and power in language variation and change, among them 
Janda, who argues for the centrality of a feature she calls "virility" to 
salience in Slavic languages, which helps explain both synchronic 
patterns and diachronic changes in Slavic case and number agreement.' 
While virility represents an appealing concept in the age of feminist 
theory, the concept of agency applies more generally. Factors that 
contribute to agency include animacy and social status; thus for humans, 
ILaura A. Janda, UNC Chapel Hill, public lecture at Emory University, 
10/16/1997, "Virility in Slavic: A Conspiracy of Factors Over Time and 
Space;" see also Janda 1999. 

24 
The Definiteness Continuum 
gender and age play a role as well. Children have less agency than 
adults, animals have less agency than humans, and inanimate objects 
are unlikely to be perceived as having agency at all. I will argue here 
and in Chapter 2 that agency provides a possible explanation for certain 
patterns of definite marking and agreement in some dialects. 
The major objection to hierarchies of individuation or salience 
lies in their vagueness. The features that comprise such hierarchies 
need detailed investigation and definition involving a large corpus of 
naturally occurring data. Pending such a study, attention will focus 
here on those features which seem to have the greatest relevance to or 
explanatory power for the syntax of spoken Arabic. The list in Table 
1-2, revised from Khan's (Table 1- 1), includes syntactic, semantic, 
pragmatic, and sociolinguistic features, covering a range of levels that 
interact in the production of language. These features appear to play a 
role in pushing a noun toward higher or lower individuation, affecting 
the speaker's choice of syntactic marking of nouns in spoken Arabic 
when a choice of marking presents itself. 
Table 1-2: Features Affecting Individuation 
1. Agency: includes humanness/animacy, social status or power, 
perhaps gender and age groups as well. 
2. Definiteness: syntactic marking or semantic status (e.g., proper 
nouns). 
3. Specificity vs. genericness: the extent to which a speaker has 
a specific entity in mind. 
4. Textual or physical prominence: the extent to which a noun 
plays a role important to the discourse, or is physically present 
and prominent. 
5. Qualification: modification of a noun with adjectives and other 
descriptives. 
6. Quantification vs. collectivity: the extent to which a noun is 
specifically quantified, especially with numbers from 2-10. 
Taken as a group, it is clear that these features affect the syntactic 
behavior of nouns, but in a way that is not (yet) possible to describe 
formally. It is more convenient to formalize them using a continuum, 
which has the additional advantage of priVileging speaker control in 
determining the marking of a given noun. In Figure 1, the features on 
the right tend to reflect (or, from the speaker's point of view, attract) 
higher individuation or salience, the ones on the left, less: 

1.3 Definiteness and Individuation

+ collectivity 
Partly individuated 
Individuated : 
+ agency/animacy 
+ definite 
+ specific 
+ prominence

25 
The importance of this continuum lies less in predicting the 
marking on the noun itself than in explaining the syntactic behavior of 
the noun in the larger sentential context, as I will show. In other 
words, the higher the individuation of a noun in the mind of the speaker, 
the more that noun will attract certain kinds of syntactic marking. 
1.3 
Definiteness and Individuation 
The correspondence between individuation and definiteness in 
Arabic is not direct, because syntactic rules also affect defmite marking. 
For example, abstract and generic nouns in Arabic are marked with the 
definite article. Thus an unspecified noun referring to any member of 
the class may be marked with /(i)l-/, while a specified human noun 
may not be marked definite. In the following introduction to a joke, 
the unnamed but somewhat specified bedouin is marked indefmite with 
the indefmite article /waid/, while the generic restaurant and waiter 
are both marked defmite?

There's this bedouin who went into a restaurant. He said to the 
waiter, give me ice cream. 
Grammar views definiteness as a dichotomy: nouns are either 
definite or not. But the real world that a speaker knows and desires to 
represent is far from black and white: some nouns may be somewhat 
defined or specified but not entirely, either from the point of view of 
Ǟhe joke is cited in full, and its nominal markings further discussed, in 1.5. 

26 
The Definiteness Continuum 
the speaker or in the assumptions the speaker makes about the listener's 
knowledge. Definiteness is a grammatical category in which the speaker 
has a degree of control, and speakers of Arabic need to represent a 
range of undefmed, partially defined, and fully defined entities. Definite 
and indefinite represent the black and white ends of a definiteness 
continuum, while the grey area of partially defined or specified entities 
falls in between. I will call this range indefinite-specific, after Wald 
(1983).3 It includes nouns that are syntactically indefinite, but carry a 
degree of specific reference that may be reflected in a number of possible 
syntactic constructions. In other words, an indefinite noun that carries 
a degree of individuation or specificity may attract a degree of definite 
or specifying syntactic marking. Or, as described from a different 
perspective, a speaker may be influenced by these features to mark a 
noun in a certain way. The rest of the chapter will explore the use of 
definite and indefinite markers in the dialects, and show how spoken 
Arabic uses various combinations of syntactic markings to indicate a 
range of indefinite-specific status. 
1.4 
Indefinite-Specific Marking 
The semantic range from highly individuated (e.g. definite, 
specific, or animate) nouns to non-individuated (e.g. indefinite, non­
specific, or inanimate) nouns includes varying degrees of definiteness 
and specificity. The more specific the reference of the noun, the greater 
the probability that the noun will be syntactically marked with some 
kind of article or specifying construction. This section will examine 
two kinds of indefinite-specific marking, the article I8il in Moroccan 
and Syrian, and the indefinite suffix I-in/, found in some Gulf regions. 
1.4.1 Indefinite-Specific Article i§ii 
Both Syrian and Moroccan speakers often identify a noun in the 
indefinite-specific range with the referential indefinite article /§il some 
(kind of). In the following sentence, /§i/ lends a degree of specificity to 
the noun /muqaddimel introduction. 
JWald uses the term 'indefinite specific' to explain the use of this in spoken 
English in sentences such as I saw this guy ...

Here, as in the Syrian example, the article i/ indicates the partial 
specificity of the nouns it modifies. It is worth noting that all of the 
nouns in the Moroccan examples are modified, reflecting the relevance 
of qualification to the individuation of a noun. The Moroccan data 
thus provide evidence of correspondence among qualification, 
specificity, and syntactic marking on nouns. All these examples 
demonstrate that speakers use i/ to indicate that they have a particular 
type of entity in mind. 
1.4.2 Nunation as Indefinite-Specific Marking 
In formal Arabic, nunation or ltanwinl refers to the endings I-un/, 
I-anI, and I-inl that function as indefinite case markers on nouns and 
adjectives. Nunation thus represents part of the case-marking system 
of formal Arabic. However, spoken Arabic has no case-marking system. 
In a number of dialects, nunation in the form of I-anI (/tanwin fatl.lal) 
occurs in certain fixed adverbial expressions, such as /'abadanl ever, at 

28 
The Definiteness Continuum 
all, and /dayman/ always. Adverbial I-anI is of higher productivity in 
the educated registers of spoken Arabic. 
Another type of nunation, usually realized as /-in/ and occurring 
on indefinite nouns in a number of bedouin dialects, especially in their 
poetic register, are considered to be vestiges of the case-marking system 
of formal Arabic. Yet this suffix provides no case information. Holes 
mentions "the vestige of' a suffix Joint, found in "the speech of some 
less educated Gulf speakers, and in dialect poetry," which marks 
indefinite nouns only when occurring in "Noun + Attributive Adjective" 
phrases (1990: 1 15). In his study of Najdi Arabic, Ingham includes the 
indefinite marker I-in/ as part of noun phrase structure (1994:47):4 
indefinite 
indefinite (marked) 
definite 
possessed 
bet 
bet-in 
aI-bet 
bet-i/-ik 
'house' or 'a house' 
'a (particular) house' 
'the house' 
'my/your house etc.' 
This schema suggests that /-in/ functions as an indefinite-specific marker, 
and Ingham's description of the usage patterns of this ending further 
confirms this analysis (1994: 49; IND = indefinite): 
(i) where a nominal follows another nominal as in bet-in kibir 
(house-IND large) 'a large house;' (ii) where a modifying 
prepositional phrase follows a nominal as in wabd-in min ar-rabu' 
(one-IND from the group) 'one of the group' (Le. one of my 
friends) ... (iii) where a noun is followed by a modifying clause 
as in kalmit-in gal-o-hii-Ii (word-IND said-they-it-to-me) 'a word 
which they said to me.' 
Nunation in Najdi Arabic occurs on indefinite nouns modified by 
an adjective or relative clause, in other words, on specified indefinite 
nouns. The fact that this ending occurs on indefinite nouns that are 
modified in some way is significant, for it indicates that such a noun is 
not purely indefinite, but has a degree of specificity. Urban Kuwaiti 
seems to have lost the ending except in highly formalized contexts 
such as poetry; most published material on this phenomenon does not 
distinguish between poetic use of /-in/,which belongs to a special artistic 
register, and examples taken from naturally-occurring speech. Al­
Ma<lUq's study of the tribal dialect of the <Ajman in Kuwait reports 
41t occurs on plural nouns as well: /mgaddm-in-in/ submitted-p-indef (Ingham 
1994: 167). 

1.4 Indefinite-Specific Marking 
29 
similar use of /-in/, but her examples too are taken largely from proverbs 
and poetry, rather than extemporaneous speech ( 1986:1 90-91). 
This function of nunation appears to be quite old. Evidence for 
the use of nunation with /-an/ as an indefinite-specific marker may be 
found in early Spanish Arabic texts. Corriente reports that this kind of 
nunation has "the function of linking constituents," these constituents 
being an indefinite noun with a following adjective or relative clause 
(1977: 121-2). Corriente's examples clearly show contexts in which an 
indefmite noun is qualified or partly specified, resulting in an indefinite­
specific noun phrase marked with /-an!. These phrases include (121-2): 
kalban abyac;l 
a white dog 
bi-xiΛiran yattaqad mi!1 aI-niT 
with a mind as bright as fire 
<ala qalban katir 
with an unfaithful heart 
Shumaker's ( 1981) study of the indefmite suffix /-an! in Galland's 
fourteenth or fifteenth century manuscript of Alf Layla wa Layla (The 
Thousand and One Nights, ed. Mahdi 1 984) establishes patterns of 
/-an/ as a syntactic marker of textually prominent entities that appear to 
correspond to indefinite-specific patterns. Her conclusions suggest that 
/-an! functions in the text as a type of indefinite-specific article. Examples 
from the text support this analysis; in the following passages, indefinite 
nouns that are specified with adjectival or relative phrases end in /-an/. 
From the "Story of the Porter and the Three Girls" (Arabic text from 
Mahdi 1984i: 126; transcription and translation mine):

When suddenly there stood before him a woman wrapped in a 
Mosuli shawl fringed with silk 
The suffix I-ani on limra'at-anl woman is marked in the Arabic text, 
and the noun is partly specified by the following phrase. Another part 
of the story contains an instance of nunation marking an indefinite 
noun modified by a relative clause (Mahdi 1984i: 138):

Jatar said, Caliph, those are people in whom drunkenness has

It may be argued that these examples belong to an artistic register and 
do not necessarily reflect everyday speech. At the very least, though, 
these texts provide evidence for the indefinite-specific function of 
nunation as part of some register of Arabic in the medieval period. 
Evidence thus exists supporting the use of Itanwin/ as an indefmite­
specific marker in a number of geographic locations from an early 
period, and surviving until today in parts of the Peninsula, perhaps also 
in Levantine lQadanl someone, anyone, which may be a reflex of this 
indefinite-specific nunation. 
Egyptian dialects do not appear to have any articles that specify 
or individuate an indefinite noun. In order to express the notion of 
specificity when referring to an indefinite noun, Egyptian speakers 
commonly employ the adverb /kidal thus, so as a modifier: 
E2 
. . .  I஠ 4b. .:..L!. 
§uft J:tilga kida 
saw-I thing like-this 
I saw something . .. or I saw this thing ... 
In addition, Egyptians use several nouns that function in similar 
fashion, that is, to lend certain kinds of specificity to an indefinite 
noun, and thus can be identified as specialized indefinite-specific 
markers, since they have more specialized meanings than does I§i/. 
The meanings of these articles involve plurality or intensification: I'Bit 
some or a bunch of, in a series, something in certain idiomatic phrases, 
and lQittitl what a . .  .! (Badawi and Hinds 1986:25,190). Clearly, I'BiI 
is related to l§if. Badawi and Hinds give three contexts for this article; 
the first is of interest here (1986:25):

[at-him of-what all-it 'Bi cheese and-'i8i olives and-'i8i sardines] 
he has something of everything-cheese, olives, sardines ... 
In such cases, /'Bi/ intensifies the following noun, and in doing so 
specifies it; however, /)i8i/ is not regularly used to specify indefinite 
nouns, but only in contexts where quantity or variety is stressed. 
Other intensifiers are more commonly used in Egypt, among 
them /Qittit/, literally a piece of While this particle is mainly understood 
as an intensifier expressing astonishment or admiration, part of its 
function is specification:

We found a mouse this big, what a mouse this big! 
1.5 Definiteness and First Mention: New Topic 
On the continuum of definiteness, near the indefinite-specific 
range, there appears to be an area reserved for the first mention in 
discourse of 'textually prominent' entities (one of Khan's features, see 
Table 1-1). The first mention of a nominal entity in discourse may be 
indefinite, indefinite-specific, or, in some cases (and in Moroccan in 
particular), definite in marking. Not all first-mention nouns are of 
equal importance to the discourse; some nouns play a more prominent 
role than others. Discourse analysts distinguish between figure and 
ground, or central and marginal entities (and events) in discourse 
respectively (Hopper and Thompson 1 980). An entity that plays an 
important role in a text is likely to be marked in a way that reflects that 
status, whereas an entity that is part of the background is Jess likely to 
be so marked. 
In the following joke, the specified and textually prominent figure 
bedouin is marked with an 'indefinite' article /wal)id/, while the inanimate, 
unspecified, even generic nouns /l-maГ'am/ restaurant and /l-garson/ 
waiter are marked with the definite article, and inanimate /bfJ?-a/ ice 
cream has no article in its first occurrence:

There's this bedouin who went into a restaurant. He said to the 
waiter, give me ice cream. He brought him a plate of ice cream, 
he began to eat it with bread. The waiter started laughing at 
him. He said, what are you laughing at? Your ice-cold cooking?! 
The speaker telling this joke introduces its subject, /badwi/ (a) bedouin, 
with the indefinite /waJ:lid/ one, for two reasons: first, because the 
bedouin's existence is previously unknown, and second, because he 
plays a key role in the joke and therefore specific referentiality must be 
established. On the other hand, /il-mat'am/ the restaurant and /il-garson/ 
the waiter are marked definite at their first mention, the former due to 
its generic status and the latter because any restaurant may be presumed 
to have a waiter working in it. Were the speaker to have said /rat 'a 
mat'am/ he went into a restaurant, it might imply that the restaurant 
had some importance to the story, in which case further specification 
would be expected. In contrast, ice cream, which also has some textual 
prominence, is less individuated because it is inanimate, and so its first 
mention is indefinite but not marked with an indefinite-specific article. 
These 'textually prominent' entities fall in the indefinite-specific 
range, but represent a special case within it. Such entities may be 
called "new topics," making the article /waJ:lid/ a "new topic" article.s 
Evidence from Syrian suggests that /waJ:lid/ modifies only human 
nouns. Egyptian data exhibit a similar pattern, with the usage of /wa}:lid/ 
5r have adapted the term 'new topic' from Wald (1983).

also syntactically restricted to human nouns: 
E2 
. .. ::.... i.bl.J ( iJlS 
kan fi waJ:tda sitt 
was-it there-is one woman 
There was a/this woman ... 
33 
In this Kuwaiti example (repeated from 1 . 1 . 1  above), /wal,tid/ also 
modifies a human noun, /mŌawwa'/ learned religious man. 
K3 
tn .b1.J .s... .:..:o.IJ 
ral,tat I}agg wal}id möawwa' 
went-she to one religious-man 
She went to a learned religious man 
Evidence thus suggests that "new topic" status as marked 
syntactically by the article /wal}id/ is restricted in Egyptian, Syrian, and 
Kuwaiti dialects to textually prominent, highly individuated, and 
specifically human, nouns. 
In contrast to the restricted use of /wal,tid/ in the other dialects, 
the Moroccan article /wal,tRd 1-/ is not restricted to human or even 
animate nouns, but extends to inanimates as well: 
MlO 
.. . ..:.౦I ol ஘i t.,.:J1 .b1.J &IS

There's this other kind offish ... 
In Moroccan, Iwal}Rdl is obligatorily followed by the definite 
article II-I: Iwal}Rd I-I, and it is used with a much broader range of 
entities, not only human but also inanimate entities if they are textually 
prominent. The following Moroccan passage introduces two characters 
in similar fashion, and a third differently (all marked in boldface):

34 
The Definiteness Continuum 
I tell you a story, this is a man who doesn't have children. He 
has only the wife, and his wife never bore children. Then she 
had a daughter. 
This story opens with the introduction of a main character identified by 
the article Iwii}:ld I-I a. The next characters introduced are II-wliidl 
children, marked definite because of their high animacy, except that 
their existence is negated, and so they do not constitute a topic. The 
wife /I-mral is not marked as a new topic, however, presumably because 
her existence may be inferred, as most men are married, and she thus 
constitutes a retrievable entity that does not need Џo be singled out for 
introduction. The next topic introduced is II-bntl girl, marked with 
Iwiil:td I-I as a new topic and important to the story. The function of 
IwaQd I-I as a new topic marker is substantiated by the fact that the 
man and the girl are the only two characters who reappear in the story. 
Two entities are introduced in the next passage. The first, Iwld 
I-malikl {aJ king's son is human, and also has an important role to play 
in the story, and so the speaker takes care to establish textual prominence 
for him by marking the phrase with Iwa}:ld/. The second identity, 
rsr'i.dm/ window is neither animate nor topical, and thus is not marked 
by the new-topic article. 
M I l

So, my lady, this prince up and -- She had a window like that. 
She leaned out of the window 
In the third passage, the repetition of /mra xWra/ another wife 
with the addition of the 'new-topic' article /wiil:td I-I may be due to the 
necessity of marking this second wife as a significant character in the 
story. After omitting the article in her first mention of the woman, the 
speaker may have subconsciously felt that the character needed more 
of an introduction:

He up and married another woman, married this other woman 
Further evidence that /wal)id/ functions as a new topic marker 
lies in the use of /§i/ without /wal)Rd/ in both Moroccan and Syrian. 
While partially individuated, textually prominent persons may be 
introduced with !§i wal)(i)d/ someone, speakers of both dialects can use 
/§i/ to mean someone when the reference is non-individuated, non­
specific, not textually prominent, and of low social status. An example 
from Caubet's Moroccan texts ( 1993ii:7):

The marking of an indefinite noun with the new-topic article 
/wal)id (1-)/ appears to be motivated by the high degree of textual 
prominence played by that noun. The derivation of the article itself, 
/wal.rid/ one, further supports the notion that quantification, individuation, 
and textual prominence are all related to each other as well as to the 
syntactic marking of nouns. 

36 
The Definiteness Continuum 
1.6 Definite Marking in Moroccan6 
Moroccan speech in particular is characterized by the occurrence 
of unexpectedly "definite" nouns that fulfill none of the conditions 
specified by Chafe (see 1 .2). First-mention nouns are normally indefinite 
in Arabic, as in most languages that mark definiteness. But in the 
following passage (repeated from above), even though children is 
semantically indefinite, since the man in question has none, and his 
wife is introduced for the first time, both /1-wUid/ the children and 
/I-mra/ the wife both have definite marking in this passage: 
, 
M l l  1;11 ΐ .Ø ,J'(,JI utJØL. Α1.;11 .b.IJ IJLA ,dJ எ6.

told-I-to-you this one the-man neg at-him the-children, at-him 
only the-wife 
I'll tell you a story, this is a man who has no children. He has 
only a wife 
The next passage contains the first mention of /bit! room in the story; 
therefore, it would be expected to be indefinite. On the other hand, the 
noun /bItt has highly individuated reference in this case, which 'attracts' 
the definite article here.

father-hers king sultan and arose-he made-he for-her the-suite 
gen-hers by-herself 
Her father [was] a king, a sultan, and he up and made her a 
suite of her own 
Similarly, /l-w;}ld/ the son in the following refers to a nonexistent 
child. The importance and (future) agency of the desired son attract 
definite marking to a noun that should otherwise be indefinite:

6See Caubet (1983) for a more detailed, formalized approach to definiteness 
in Moroccan Arabic. 

1.6 Definite Marking in Moroccan 
37 
There is no previous mention of /mr/ bull in the passage from 
which the next example is taken, nor does it appear to have specific or 
generic reference, and yet it is marked definite. In this case, either 
animacy has influenced the 'indefiniteness' of the noun and pushed it 
towards the definite end of the continuum, or the speaker assumes that 
a slaughtered bull is an expected and retrievable part of celebrating a 
son's birth: 
Ml l U"W '  u1c QJI- ' J.,:J '  .J 
dbRJ.t t-tiir, (ra" (la n-nas 
slaughtered-he the-bull, invited-he the-people 
He slaughtered a bull, invited people 
Finally, even though the reference of /l-J.tiit/ fish in the following sentence 
is semantically indefinite, generic, and nonspecific, it carries definite 
marking. 
What attracts definite marking here may be the textual 
importance of fish to the passage on the depressed fishing economy of 
Larache from which this sentence is taken: 
MlO -=.,pJ' &:!LS " J  Jȯ દ..;ધ *l. 
ma§i t§iif b-(ink tqiil rab kayn I-J.tiit 
fut you-see with-eye-your you-say see-here there-is the-fish 
You'll see with your own eyes and say there are fish 
The examples just cited may be contrasted to the following passage, 
in which an indefinite noun does occur. Here true indefinite nouns are 
not marked with the so-called "indefinite" articles: /hIM/ a place is 
without marking, due to its indefinite, unspecific, and inanimate status 
in the story; in other words, it is not individuated.

Of the four dialects, Moroccan speech is clearly the most influenced 
by the specificity and animacy factors, both of which may trigger the 
use of definite marking. In the following, all animate nouns are marked 
with either the definite article or a possessive pronoun, even though not 
all are semantically definite and specific:

You have seven sisters, and your father took a second wife for 
fa] son,for her to bear fa] son 
Kuwaiti speech contains instances of this phenomenon as well. 
In these examples, /waladha/ her son has specific reference, at least in 
the mind of the speaker, as does /I-'ahal/ the people in the second.

The difference between specific and non-specific reference is 
demonstrated by the following passage. The woman in this passage 
replies twice to the slave's question, saying at first /wbdt bnt/ I had a 
girl, and the second time, /wldt l-wld/, literally I had the son.

The slave went to her, said to her, 'My master says, what did you 
bear?' She told him, '/ had a girl.' He told her, 'Tell me what 
you had--if you had a girl, / will slay you and slay her.' Until 
she saw him coming at her with the knife. She told him, 'Calm 
down, / had a son.' 
The discrepancy in marking between the indefinite girl and definite 
son may be attributable to the social importance of the male child, 
giving him a higher degree of individuation. In any case, it is clear that 
these features operate as semantic continua, leaving a fair degree of 
control to the speaker. 
Another feature that seems to attract defInite marking to Moroccan 
nouns is that of inalienable possession. Diem (1986) investigates the 
concepts of alienability and inalienability in Semitic, and suggests that 
this broad distinction is useful in determining the grammaticality of 
sentences containing pseudo-verbs /'and/ and /Ii-/, both meaning to 
have, in spoken Arabic. These concepts are indeed important, and in 
fact they are more broadly applicable than Diem suggests, especially to 
Moroccan. Diem cites two contrasting examples from a Fez informant, 
the one on the right judged to be grammatical, and the one on the left 
ungrammatical (1986:278): 
M 
Ý G .¹ '" 
.)س . 
.. 'ndu bba mUhiir 
.. Er hat einen beriihmten Vater 
[He has afamousfather] 
M 
iǡ .)J..I .¹ 
'ndu dar kbrra 
Er hat ein grosses Haus 
[He has a big house] 
The ungrammaticality of the second example, Diem claims, is due to 
the inalienable nature of father. A more precise explanation is that this 
inalienable nature interferes not with the construction to have, but with 
the reference of the noun itself: Ibba/ father is interpreted by my 
informants as my father: 

40 
The Definiteness Continuum 
Ml 
4 I J 
';}yy;}n 'la bba 
called-I on father 
1 called my father (elicited) 
When pushed to make some sense out of Diem's "ungrammatical" 
example, my Moroccan infonnants came up with the interpretation He 
thinks my father is famous. Moreover, they found the following sentence 
acceptable: 
Ml 
JK .4 . .l.U 
'ndu bbah m8hUr 
at-him father-his famous 
He has a famous father or Hisfather isfamous 
The concept of inalienability applies to /bba/ father as a noun, regardless 
of its syntactic position, in that a father cannot be indefinite or 
"unassigned." The word /bba/ may not be interpreted as a father but 
only as my father. An unusual "double' genitive construction cited by 
Harning shows a similar pattern ( 1980: 132): 
M 
ત J lA77 
babaha de-yimma 
father-her gen Mother 
der Vater meiner Mutter {my mother'sfatherJ 
Here, too, the double marking of the possession seems to be motivated 
by the need to mark the noun Ibaba/ father as definite. 
Similarly, my Moroccan infonnants have difficulty producing an 
indefinite fonn of the word /xa-/ brother. In the next passage, the 
speaker marks /xay/ my brother and /'ammi/ my uncle for possession, 
resulting in definite noun phrases, even though the sentence clearly 
indicates that she has neither a brother nor an uncle: 
M9 ħ   c.PL. J.aIJ ǿ L-. .l.U L. ';- .l.U L. L.i. .l.U L.

neg at-me brother-my neg at-me uncle-my neg at-me even any 
one will act-on-behalf of-me 
I don't have a brother, 1 don't have an uncle, 1 don't have anyone 
who would act on my behalf 

J.6 Definite Marking in Moroccan 
41 
Moroccan speakers thus consistently avoid using tenns for male 
relatives in the indefinite. Diem's concept of inalienability, applied to 
the individuation continuum, explains this pattern. In tum, it is worth 
noting that these persons have a high degree of agency, which also may 
operate to attract specific, definite marking. The individuation hierarchy 
explains why certain kinds of nouns cannot remain "unassigned" or 
unspecified. The higher the individuation of a given noun or noun 
phrase, the more likely it is to receive definite syntactic marking. In 
the case of Moroccan, certain nouns with high animacy indicating 
close familial relations seem to take definite marking even in contexts 
low in definiteness. 
The continuum of individuation also explains another feature 
particular to Moroccan speech. In most varieties of Arabic, both members 
of a defmite noun-adjective phrase must agree in defmiteness, such that 
both will carry the definite article, as the following Egyptian and Syrian 
examples show: 
El 
..J.,J.I ঃt:J1 
it-tayer iI-mav 
the-outfit the-mauve 
the mauve outfit 
S2 
(.jJ% I &1 
iI-muztama< s-siiri 
the-society the-Syrian 
Syrian society 
However, my Moroccan data include examples of asymmetrically 
definite constructions such as the following: 
MlO (.j' ..:..,.:a6J1 ... Iǻl# ... 
... kaytba<u f I-Q.anut 'aWri 
... indic-they-are-sold in-the-store modem 
. . .  they are sold in a modern store 
The phrase /l-Q.anut <aWri/ althe modern store consists of a definite 
noun (l1-Q.aniit/) modified by an indefinite adjective (I<aWri/), a 
construction not pennitted under the syntactic rules of Arabic. If it 
were an isolated occurrence, it could be dismissed as a perfonnance 
error; however, several such examples occur in my data. Moreover, 
Harrell notes the occurrence of asymmetrically definite noun-adjective 
phrases in Moroccan, and notes that the adjective tends to remain 
unmarked unless the reference is quite specific (1962: 166). In fact, 

42 
The Definiteness Continuum 
specificity may not be the only factor involved. The following example 
contains a noun-adjective phrase in which the noun is specified, but the 
adjective is indefinite: 
Ml (.)AΓ l+i-,J LAØ 
';)ndha duqha xa__ 
at-her taste-her special 
She has her own taste or She has a special taste of her own 
The asymmetric definiteness of the phrase /duqha xa__/ her own special 
taste may be explained by the low animacy and high abstractness of 
the noun /duq/ taste, rendering the noun relatively low in individuation, 
and attracting the indefmite form of the adjective. A Moroccan informant 
confirms that the adjective is marked definite only in highly individuated 
contexts, such as the following: 
M3 tJY1 Z 'ΔI )J.lI LAØ 
';)ndha d-dar l-mxayy;)ra f §-§ar;)' 
at-her the-house the-choice in the-street 
She has the best house on the street (elicited) 
These Moroccan examples show that indefinite marking can 
interact with definite marking when the noun in question is not highly 
individuated. The reverse can also happen: at times definite marking 
can interact with indefinite to give higher specificity or individuation 
to an otherwise indefinite noun. Chapter 3 will show that this latter 
phenomenon occurs as well in relative clause structures in all four 
dialects. 
1.7 Summary 
The data cited in this chapter show clearly the inadequacy of 
traditional categories of definite and indefinite, and suggest that definite 
and indefmite marking represent two ends of a continuum of definiteness, 
which includes an indefinite-specific range that may be expressed 
syntactically by one of several strategies. 
The articles j§i/ and /wal:tid/ do not mark true indefinite nouns, 
but rather nouns that lie somewhere between definite and indefinite, in 
an indefinite-specific range. This range is represented in the syntax of 

1.7 Summary 
43 
all four dialects, in Moroccan and Syrian by the article /Si/, in all four 
dialects by the article /walJid (1-)/, which functions as a "new-topic" 
article, and in Syrian, Egyptian and Kuwaiti by the interaction of the 
semantics with other defmite and indefmite markers, such as the use of 
definite relative pronouns with morphologically indefinite nouns.7 
The geographical distribution of indefinite articles in Moroccan 
and Syrian, both of which share /Si/, the related Egyptian article /'iJi/, 
and the apparent indefinite-specific function of the suffix I-in! in the 
Arabian Peninsula-even though it is disappearing in urban dialects-are 
facts that invite further diachronic research. The fact that Moroccan 
and Syrian dialects share the article /Si! and Tunisian and Iraqi share a 
similar article /fard/ suggests that these articles have fulfilled this function 
for a very long time. Likewise, evidence that nunation plays a role as 
specifying marker in Andalusian texts, a medieval Thousand and One 
Nights manuscript, and the bedouin dialects of the Gulf, suggests that 
this function has long been part of spoken Arabic. The absence in 
Egyptian and urban Kuwaiti of an indefmite-specific article suggests 
that these dialects may have undergone a linguistic levelling process 
which reduced the number of syntactic markers of definiteness and 
specificity. 
Overall, Moroccan and Syrian dialects show greater richness and 
variation in nominal syntactic marking, leading to speCUlation of a 
degree of cross-dialect hierarchy in which Moroccan shows highest 
definite and indefinite-specific marking, while Egyptian shows the least. 
The fact that Cairene Arabic falls on the lower end of the spectrum of 
dialects in the range of specifying articles is paralleled also by its 
relative paucity of demonstrative forms, as Chapter 4 will show. 
70ther dialects appear to have indefinite-specific articles as well: Tunisian 
and Iraqi appear to share a specifying article /fard/ one (see Marèais 1977 for 
a description of Tunisian and Erwin 1963 for Iraqi). 

2 NUMBER, AGREEMENT, AND POSSESSION 
2.0 
Introduction 
This chapter examines patterns of plural number agreement and 
genitive (possessive) modification of nouns in the four dialect regions. 
Each of these structures has two possible syntactic manifestations in 
spoken Arabic: plural nouns may be modified with either plural or 
feminine singular forms, and possessive relationships may be expressed 
using either the construct (/ic;lafa!)1 or a periphrastic genitive with a 
genitive particle or exponent. Patterns of feminine singular agreement 
with plural nouns occur in all four dialects, and are difficult, if not 
impossible, to explain in purely formal terms. I will argue that the 
continuum of individuation ( 1 .2) helps explain the choice of one 
agreement form over another. Harning's (1980) study of genitive 
constructions in spoken Arabic proposes certain "stylistic" motivations 
for the choice of the periphrastic genitive over the construct; her 
conclusions are reexamined here within the framework of individuation. 
Chapter 1 proposed that speakers use definite and indefinite 
markings to indicate the degree of individuation of a noun such that the 
higher the degree of individuation of the noun, the more likely the 
speaker to assign to it a specifying or definite article. The following 
features were shown to affect the individuation of nouns (repeated 
from section 1 .2): 
1. Agency/Animacy 
2. Definiteness 
3. Specificity 
4. Textual prominence 
5. Qualification or modification 
6. Quantification 
These features also play a role in the syntactic realization of agreement 
phenomena and genitive/possessive constructions in the dialects. 
'The construct consists of two consecutive nouns, the second of which 
"possesses" (literally or figuratively) the first. In general, the construct in 
spoken Arabic follows the same rules that govern it in formal Arabic, except 
that the former has no case markings. 
44 

2.1 The Dual 
45 
The discussion of number agreement begins with a brief overview 
of the dual in spoken Arabic. While the dual in formal Arabic constitutes 
more a morphological than a syntactic category, its counterpart in spoken 
Arabic carries syntactic implications and is of comparative interest. 
2.1 
The Dual 
Two major articles by Blanc and Ferguson stress that the dual is 
not a productive category in spoken Arabic.2 While the dual suffix 
I-enl (Moroccan I-ayn/) is productive in many areas as a nominal ending, 
no dual adjectival or verbal markings exist. Ferguson (1959b) identifies 
the absence of dual agreement as one case of grammatical consistency 
among the dialects which is not found in Classical Arabic. He finds 
that the dual is least productive in Moroccan and South Arabian dialects, 
and most productive in the Syro-Mesopotamian area. 
Blanc's ( 1970) seminal study of the dual in spoken Arabic 
concludes that Arabic dialects share a two-part dual system, comprised 
of dual and pseudo-dual. Blanc distinguishes regular, productive duals 
from a non-productive, frozen pseudo-dual category consisting mainly 
of words referring to paired parts of the body (e.g., Syrian /'izren/ 
legs). These pseudo-duals function semantically and syntactically as 
plurals, and in a number of dialects, no alternate plural forms for such 
words exist. Blanc concludes that the dual is not a concord category in 
spoken Arabic; rather dual nouns function syntactically like other 
enumerated nouns, and generally take plural agreement.3 
2.1.1 Non-specific Dual 
Cowell's Syrian grammar claims that the dual is "used to specify 
exactly two of whatever the noun base designates" (1964:367, emphasis 
2By contrast, the dual in formal Arabic carries full inflection in nouns, 
adjectives, relative and demonstrative pronouns, and verb conjugations. 
3Exceptions noted by Blanc for Syrian and Moroccan, in which dual nouns 
can be modified by feminine adjectives or verbs, may be explained using the 
individuation hierarchy. All examples cited contain temporal nouns, such as 
day, month, or year. These nouns consistently occur in syntactic constructions 
low in individuation, such as non-resumptive relative clauses (see 3.4) Sections 
2.2 and 2.3 show that feminine or collective agreement is consistent with 
speaker's perceptions of such nouns as not highly individuated. 

46 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
in original). This assertion is refuted by examples from various dialects 
in which the dual represents a small but inexact quantity, translatable 
as a couple of or several. Expressions such as /yomen/ a couple of 
days or several days and /kilamten/ (Egyptian /kilmiten/) a couple of 
words or a few words are common in both Syria and Egypt. Feghali 
confirms that the dual in Lebanese usually expresses "une quantite 
indeterminee" ( 1928: 141). 
This dual clearly falls in the non-specific range in the Syrian 
region, where it is often modified by the indefinite-specific article /8i/: 
L 
UI.,.... ౓L... * l.AǴ ,౔Iౕ ':;",Jز &-a 
min bayIiit la-trablus, badha si sa'ten swa'a 
from Beirut to-Tripoli, wants-she si hours-2 driving 
From Beirut to Tripoli it's about a two-hour drive 
In the central dialects, then, one function of the dual suffix /-en/ 
is to indicate a non-specific paucal plural, a couple of or several. 
Moroccans, on the other hand, use the periphrastic dual, rather than the 
dual suffix /-ayn/, for such expressions. A Moroccan informant gives 
two possibilities for a couple of steps, meaning a short distance (both 
elicited): 
M3 
.:;.l.i1.:i.. t:._ 
zuz xalrat 
two steps 
.:;.1றI J t:._ 
zuz d al-xatwat 
two gen the-steps 
Of all four dialects, Moroccan has the most restricted use of dual 
suffixes. Section 2. 1 .2 will discuss several features of the Moroccan 
dual that set it apart from the dual as used in other dialects. 
2.1.2 Dual in Moroccan 
Moroccan distinguishes phonetically between dual forms such as 
/'amayn/ two years and what are in other dialects pseudo-duals, namely 
parts of the body, which in Moroccan take the suffix /-in/: as in 
/yaddin/ hands and /rajlln/ legs (Harrell 1962: 105, Blanc 1970:48). In 
Moroccan speech, the suffix /-ayn/ (also pronounced as /-ayn/) is 
restricted to a finite set of nouns involving a few numerals, physical 
measures, time, and money, such as /'amayn/ two years, /'alfayn/ two 

2.1 The Dual 
47 
thousand, and Iyumaynl two days (see Harrell 1 962: 100-1 ;  see also 
Lerchundi 1 900 for a similar, century-old description of northern 
Moroccan). These forms are frozen, containing an unusual layl diphthong 
that occurs only in certain contexts in Moroccan (Harrell 1 962: 14); 
hence the normal Moroccan reflex of the diphthong layl is /I (rather 
than leI as found in other dialects), as in /bit! room for /baytl (or /bet!). 
Educated Moroccan informants reject forms such as /kHibaynl as not 
Moroccan. The Moroccan I-aynl suffix is thus not productive, as 
contrasted to the eastern I-en/, which may be attached to many types of 
nouns. Finally, whereas the pseudo-dual forms in other dialects may 
be paired with plural forms with which they closely correspond in 
usage (Blanc 1970:46), the Moroccan "pseudo-dual" I-inl is the only 
possible non-singular form for parts of the body. 
Blanc uses these facts to support the distinction he makes between 
what he calls the "true" dual and the pseudo-dual. As Blanc notes, 
pseudo-dual constitutes a limited class shared by most, if not all, dialect 
regions ( 1970:43). But while the "true" dual in other dialects is a 
productive category, the only productive dual in Moroccan is the 
periphrastic construction IzOz dl two of followed by a plural: IzOz d 
l-ktubl two books (Harrell 1962:206; my informants give /ktObal for 
books). 
Moroccan is the only dialect among the four whose only productive 
dual is periphrastic, but forms of periphrastic dual are found in all 
regions. The following section examines the forms and functions of 
these non-suffixed duals. 
2.1.3 Periphrastic Duals 
In addition to the Moroccan periphrastic dual Izoz d-I two of with 
a following plural, two other dialects contain periphrastic dual 
constructions as well: Kuwaiti and a rural dialect in southern Syria. 
Holes notes that some Gulf speakers use a periphrastic dual form of the 
construction plural noun + numeral two, as in /kutub i!nen/ two books, 
which alternates with /kitaben/ two books (1990: 1 49). One example of 
this periphrastic dual occurs in my Kuwaiti data, from the oldest and 
least educated speaker:

that-one neg pretty but he-loves-her 
A man is married, has two wives, one is pretty, but he doesn't 
love her, the other one isn't pretty, but he loves her 
The fact that this example is used by an elderly uneducated speaker 
suggests that this periphrastic dual is not a recent development. The 
same form of periphrastic dual was used twice in conversation by an 
educated female speaker originally from I:Iilran, a southern Syrian area 
whose dialect has a number of bedouin features (Cantineau 1946).

My Kuwaiti and rural Syrian examples of the periphrastic dual contain 
only human nouns. 
It seems significant that Moroccan and Gulf dialects and a rural 
Syrian dialect all share the feature of periphrastic dual, since one would 
expect these regions to be more conservative linguistically than the 
central regions.4 
Egyptian and Syrian speakers also make use of a periphrastic 
dual for certain classes of words. They have the option of using a 
periphrastic dual of the form numeral two + plural noun with human 
nouns. The following Egyptian example is also acceptable in Syrian: 
E 
Jat.:....o · · - I 
. 
஌ 
itnen :?ubba¯ 
two officers (Wise 1972: 12) 
40n the other hand, Ingham's description of Najdi syntax lists only a regular 
dual, and does not mention periphrastic dual forms. Ingham also notes feminine 
singular adjectival agreement with dual nouns (betenin zenah/ two good houses, 
1994:63), a construction rejected by informants from the four dialects areas 
examined here. 

2.1 The Dual 
49 
This periphrastic dual is obligatory in certain cases, as the dual suffix 
I-enl cannot be affixed to certain classes of words:5 Thus in Lebanon, 
one can only say two Lebanese using the periphrastic dual (below left), 
not the dual suffix (below right): 
L 
(.u l.:a..J 
• ' - 1 
-
. 
உ 
itnen libnaniyye 
two Lebanese-p 
• • • •  l.:a..J .. 
ر
.
 
It libnaniyyen 
It Lebanese-two 
The dual of other word classes may be expressed with either the 
periphrastic dual or the dual suffix. Both of the following forms are 
acceptable: 
L 
.Ŕt...1 ǐI 
&:!,jL:....1 
itnen 'asatze 
two teachers 
'istazen 
two teachers 
However, my Lebanese informant confirms that periphrastic litnenl 
two does not modify inanimates, or even animals: the form IQmarenl 
means two asses of the animal kingdom, while litnen l}amlrl refers to 
the human variety. 
Periphrastic dual constructions in which the numeral two either 
precedes or follows a human noun thus occur in all regions. This use 
of the numeral two parallels syntactically and functionally the use of 
the numeral Iwal}idl one as a "new topic" marker (see 1 .5). That is, 
like new topic article Iwal}idl one, new topic two functions in part to 
indicate the relatively high individuation (animacy, specificity, and/or 
textual prominence) of the entities it introduces. Further evidence 
supporting this analysis follows. 
2.1.4 Dual as New-Topic Marker 
Blanc notes that the dual may -be used to introduce two figures 
into a story, whereas mention of them after that is usually plural (1970:44, 
his sources: Spitta 1 883, Blau 1960, and his own data). Cowell remarks 
that "[i]f the number happens to be two but is beside the point, or to be 
taken for granted, then the plural is used (1964:367, emphasis in original). 
SBlanc remarks only that U[i]n all dialects, there are nouns that do not admit 
the dual at all" (1970:43). An inventory of morphological and lexical restrictions 
on the use of the dual suffix is a subject suitable for a morphological study. 

50 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
The fact that dual marking often occurs on the first mention of nouns 
suggests its use is pragmatically marked, and not simply a case of free 
variation. Nouns marked with the dual suffix usually represent new 
topics; that is, they represent the first mention of textually prominent 
entities. Cowell notes that the dual is used in contrast to the singular, 
not the plural, and that expression of a quantity of two in definite 
possessed form uses the definite plural followed by the number two 
( 1964:367): 
s 
. . "'/1 இஈ( 
ஊ
஋
 
k;)tbi t-tnen 
books-my the-two 
my two books 
Further evidence that the dual ending represents a new-topic marker 
lies in speakers' avoidance of pronoun suffixes on dual nouns, with the 
exception of body parts. Holes points out that Gulf speakers refrain 
from using pronoun suffixes on dual nouns but not on human plural 
nouns ending in I-inl (1990: 150), suggesting that the restriction on 
affixing pronoun suffixes to dual nouns has more to do with pragmatic 
factors than with rules of formal Arabic.6 If the dual suffix reflects a 
kind of salience marking similar to the marking of new topics with the 
article Iwa}:tid/ one, then it is more likely to occur in the more individuating 
syntactic construction containing a genitive exponent than in construct 
genitives (see 2.4). 
Moroccan speakers do not appear to make use of this kind of 
dual, and I have no evidence for its existence in Kuwait either. Both 
dialects use the periphrastic dual described in 2. 1 .3. The lack of this 
dual in the two peripheral, conservative dialects suggests that it has not 
always been a feature of spoken Arabic. 
Language typology and the hierarchy of number marking posits 
that dual is marked relative to plural. As Croft notes: "Most commonly, 
the dual is marked with respect to distributional behavior. Frequently, 
dual forms are found only with personal and demonstrative pronouns" 
6Rules for adding pronoun suffixes in formal Arabic dictate that the /n/ in 
both dual and sound masculine plural suffixes be dropped. In spoken Arabic, 
the /n/ may be retained, but the resulting construction is usually avoided. 

2.1 The Dual 
51 
( 1 990: 100). 
Taken together with this general linguistic pattern, 
synchronic evidence from these dialects suggests that it is not so much 
a matter of spoken Arabic losing a productive dual with full agreement 
complement as of not having it in the first place. A future diachronic 
study of the dual in spoken Arabic might explore the possibility that 
the dual ending I-en! as a new-topic salience marker represents a point 
of contact between formal and spoken Arabic, and a window on the 
role of pragmatics in the process of syntactic borrowing. 
2.1.5 Pseudo-duals 
As Blanc notes, pseudo-duals of parts of the body actually 
constitute a form of plural in Syrian and Egyptian. In fact, Cowell 
points out that a separate, "true" dual form also exists for such words 
in Syrian, formed by inserting a I-t-I before the dual suffix /-en/. Cowell 
gives the following examples ( 1964:367): 
S 
છજ, 
ઝ$, 
ઞ 
'RzRrteno 
'ilten 
tenten 
his two legs 
two hands 
two eyes 
This "new dual" ending must have developed sometime after the original 
dual ending (Blanc's pseudo-dual) was reinterpreted as a plural. This 
development, the apparent result of speakers' "need" to express the 
quantity "exactly two" specifically for parts of the body, suggests that 
the historical development of the pseudo-dual has been divorced from 
that of the "true" dual. While Syrian I-t-I distinguishes /'iden! hands 
from /'i(d)ten/ two hands, it cannot be used to differentiate between 
/yomenl a couple of days and /yomten/ two days. The fact that a 
particular dual ending exists for a specific semantic field does not 
necessarily mean that it extends to others, and any history of the dual 
in spoken Arabic must be category-specific, taking into account the 
fact that different kinds of dual exhibit different behavior. For example, 
Blanc points out that only pseudo-dual forms admit pronoun suffixes 
with the elision of the Inl from I-en/ (as in formal Arabic), such as in 
Egyptian /riglayyal my legs ( 1970:48). His "true" duals rarely admit 
such suffixes, except in formal registers of Arabic. This pattern suggests 
that the pseudo-dual may be older than the "true" dual in spoken Arabic. 

52 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
Egyptian speakers have at their disposal plural fonns that alternate 
with pseudo-dual fonns, such as I'inen in-nasi, pseudo-dual, and I'uyun 
in-nasi, plural, both meaning people's eyes. It should not be assumed, 
as Blanc does, that at most "perhaps a shade of stylistic difference" 
( 1970:46, n. 15) lies between them, because "stylistic difference" often 
points to an underlying pragmatic principle, perhaps a difference in 
degree of individuation. However, a larger corpus of contextualized 
examples needs to be examined before conclusions can be drawn. 
2.1.6 Adverbial Dual 
Another kind of dual, the adverbial, may not be dual in origin. A 
small, closed class of adverbial expressions found mostly in the Levant 
end in the suffix I-en/: 
s 
౐I 
'ahlen 
welcome! 
. 
அ 
_aQQten 
bon appetit 
ஆj-A 
marQ;}bten 
welcome! 
&' 
ba'den 
later 
Blanc claims that I'ahlen! welcome, I_al:l:ltenl bon appetit and ImarQ;}btenl 
welcome are duals; however, it seems more likely that the first two are 
actually cases of I'imalal deflection, or pronunciation of the vowel lal 
as a more fronted vowel, deflected towards Iii, known to occur in the 
Levant. At some later point I-enl (or a stressed, lengthened I-en!) was 
then reanalyzed as a dual ending, and ImarQ;}btenl was then fonned by 
analogy. The vowel shift of I'imalal may also be responsible for the 
suffix I-enl in /ba'denl after that, the origin of which would in that case 
be /ba'd 'ani after (with following verb), found in Syria and Egypt. 
2.2 
Agreement Patterns of Plural Nouns 
The 
Arabic plural has a number of subcategories.' 
Morphologically, Arabic distinguishes sound and broken plurals, and 
collective and distributive ones. Semantically, human nouns constitute 
a group distinct from inanimate ones. However, agreement patterns in 
spoken Arabic follow none of these delineations. 
Agreement patterns of plural nouns in spoken Arabic seem at 
first to be fraught with difficulties; complicated sets of rules are found 
7For an overview of plurals in educated spoken Arabic, see Sallam (1979). 

2.2 Agreement Patterns of Plural Nouns 
53 
in the grammars of several Arabic dialects. Holes notes for educated 
Gulf Arabic, which includes Kuwaiti, four "systems" of number/gender 
agreement, divided along gender and animacy lines ( 1990: 155-7). Three 
of these 'systems' are found in Kuwait: (1) in the first, all plural nouns 
take masculine plural agreement; (2) the second system distinguishes 
between human and non-human, and all non-human nouns take feminine 
singular agreement; and (3) a third system combines rules from (1) and 
(2) and allows either masculine plural or feminine singular agreement 
with non-human nouns.s However, Holes admits that it is common for 
speakers to freely alternate between systems, a fact which would seem 
to preclude calling them systems. 
Holes' analysis might stand as an example of interdialectic contact 
in the Gulf, except that dialects in other regions show similar overlapping 
agreement patterns. Adjectives and verbs modifying plural nouns 
alternate between feminine singular and plural marking.9 Thus examples 
like the following occur in all dialect regions. In the first sentence, the 
plural subject /nas/ people takes deflected agreement (feminine singular) 
on the verb Ibitfakkir/ she thinks, whereas the second sentence contains 
the same subject with a plural verb, Ibisafru/ they travel: 
53 
u... Ε I.".".; 4. I.J" L:. ...i ஄

There are people who think that it is a normal thing, that is 
SHoles (1990) does not include data on collective nouns, non-human animate 
nouns, or verbal agreement. 
΍he feminine singular agreement pattern, called deflected agreement, was 
regularized and codified in formal Arabic during its early history. However, 
the Quran and other early texts contain examples of both strict and deflected 
agreement (see Belnap 1991). It is reasonable to assume that these two types 
of agreement, deflected and plural, have coexisted for a long time. 

54 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
Moreover, in the latter example, speaker S2 uses a masculine adjective, 
Nidi! normal, to modify a feminine noun, /§agle/ thing. 
The agreement patterns in the examples cited above are difficult 
to explain in purely formal terms. Clearly, lexical items do not "control" 
agreement of nouns and adjectives; rather, the speaker determines the 
semantic or pragmatic content of the nouns themselves and chooses 
agreement patterns accordingly. Variation in agreement patterns appears 
to correlate with patterns of collective and individuated reference. In 
the case of feminine agreement cited above, /nas! people is collective, 
referring to a group of people who all think alike. Individuation-or in 
this case, lack thereof-helps explain this pattern: Human nouns lower 
in individuation, not specified or modified, but rather viewed as being 
part of a collective whole, tend to take feminine singular agreement. 
Several studies of agreement in spoken Arabic point to the role 
of individuation in determining verbal and adjectival agreement with 
plural nouns. Cowell notes that in Syrian, some plurals and collectives 
take feminine singular agreement "when collectivity or generality is 
emphasized rather than heterogeneity or particularity" (1964:423). This 
description suggests that the adjectival and verbal agreement of a plural 
noun depends on the degree to which the members of that plural set are 
individuated, and that agreement may be seen as a continuum ranging 
from collective to individuated. 
Sallam shows that quantification affects agreement in the educated 
spoken Arabic of Egypt and the Levant .( 1979:37). He contrasts the 
unacceptability of a plural adjective with a collective plural noun in the 
first of the following minimal pair to the acceptability of the second, to 
which the quantifier /8wayyit! some, afew {pieces of] is added (1979:37):

2.2 Agreement Patterns of Plural Nouns 
55 
In the following two Moroccan passages (both taken from the 
same speaker and text), the same noun is given two different agreements, 
one feminine singular and one plural. In the first, the speaker treats the 
noun In-nasi people as an unspecified, unqualified, homogenous, generic 
group. The convergence of these features, all of them non-individuating, 
serves to push the noun to the non-individuated end of the individuation 
continuum. The low individuation of In-nasi people is manifested in 
the feminine singular form of the verb Ima katfPhPmsl they don't 
understand, and the pronoun /hal on /ba'<;Ihal each other. The second 
statement contains a different kind of reference to In-nasi people. In 
this case, a more specific group of people is named, and the noun is 
qualified by Iwlad I-bladl sons of the town. This higher degree of 
specificity is reflected in the plural agreement shown on the verb phrase 
Ima bqaws kaymslwl they no longer go.

You see many people, town natives, no longer go to the beach 
The feminine singular agreement on the reflexive pronoun /ba'<;Iha/ 
each other in the former sentence is worth noting, since reflexivity is 
one of the features Khan classifies as non-individuating ( 1984:470). 
However, not all reflexive nouns are entirely non-individuated, as the 
following Syrian example shows (Cowell 1964:425): 
S 
஁ ,ౄǯ L. ţ I"J'JLA 
ha I-'alwiin rna binasbu ba'<;Ion 
[this the-colors neg indic-they-are-appropriate-for each-other] 
These colors don't go together 

56 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
Cowell argues that the reflexivity here adds to the individuation of 
these colors; however, the speaker's reference to certain specific colors 
suggests that individuation is a property of the colors themselves. Cowell 
himself observes that the same idea may be expressed by a feminine 
reflexive verb, Ima bt;}tnasabl they [3fsJ don't match. 
The principle of individuation affects agreement patterns in the 
opposite manner as well, in that some morphologically "singular" nouns 
that refer to a collective group may take plural agreement. In the 
following two Syrian passages about premarital dating, the speaker 
comments that some people accept it and some do not. In both instances, 
she uses masculine nouns, I'alaml (people, literally world) and IW 
(literally, thing) with plural agreement. In each case, it is not the 
lexical item itself that determines the agreement, but its referent, a 
group of people:

people in general:

Viewing the grammatical feature of plural agreement as a 
continuum allows a principled account of the variation that occurs, and 
reflects the speaker's control over this feature. 
At one end of the 
continuum lies collectivity, which corresponds to feminine singular 
agreement, and at the other, individuation, which corresponds to plural 
agreement. The choice of agreement depends on the features that 
influence individuation, especially specificity and agency. 
This 
continuum allows for the prediction that many plural nouns will not be 
limited to one agreement pattern: /nas/ people may be more or less 
individuated and thus may show either feminine singular or masculine 
plural agreement. 
This view of number agreement also predicts that dual nouns 
take plural agreement rather than singular: by nature, a dual noun 
indicates some degree of individuation, and hence usually does not 
provide collective reference. Similarly, in the dialects that have an 
overlap of plural and pseudo-dual fonns, the patterns of usage may be 
influenced by the degree of individuation of the noun phrase; in other 
words, the choice an Egyptian speaker makes between /'enen in-nasi 
the eyes (pseudo-dual) of the people and ruyiin in-nasi the eyes (plural) 
of the people may be based on the degree to which lin-nasi the people 
is individuated. 
In the most extensive study of agreement patterns in Arabic to 
date, Belnap investigates agreement patterns in Cairene Arabic, 
concluding that a number of factors combine to affect agreement, among 
them animacy (199 1 :61), salience (85), distance from the head noun to 
the modifier (85), and sentence typology (89). His study confinns that 
pragmatic ("functional and psychological") factors subsume fonnal and 
positional principles (99). Belnap also concludes that it is the speaker 
who really controls agreement patterns, not the head noun (143). 
The following Egyptian example, from Belnap's data, provides 
another case in which the speaker controls agreement patterns, and 

58 
Number. Agreement. and Possession 
suggests that individuation plays a central role in the selection of 
agreement. This speaker uses a feminine adjective, I'ayyanal sick, and 
a plural verb, /biyi"udul they stay, to modify the same noun within the 
same sentence (Belnap 1991 :61): 
E 
r-A(.,.J IJ)J ੾4 ȩ੿ cJ"L:J1 JS 
kull in-nas 'ayyana bi-s-sukkar wi-biyi"udu Ii-wal)duhum 
all the-people sick-f with-the-sugar and-they-sit by-themselves 
All the people are sick with diabetes and live by themselves 
Why does this speaker use a feminine adjective and a plural verb to 
describe the same group of people? In the first clause, people are 
viewed and treated as a homogenous group, whereas in the second, the 
adverbial phrase lli-wal)duhuml by themselves adds individuation, since 
every single person lives alone. A similar example shows the agreement 
shifting from feminine singular /hal to plural /huml when the speaker 
moves from talking about /Siwayyit l)agatl some things as a homogenous 
group to separating and ranking them (example from Belnap 1991 :86; 
translation mine): 
E 
US Ijl ...i"..!U &'J '" 1.",.;' '. -I *+ ut-- ... .:.o4L.. "...!.

some things ... neg by-rank importance-3fs ... and-then we-see if 
were-we we-order-them 
... a few things ... not in order of their importance ... and then 
we'll see if we can order them 
The 'distance from head noun' principle Belnap notes may be 
related to individuation. The more that is said about a noun, the more 
specified and textually prominent it becomes; therefore, if the "distance" 
between the noun and its modifier includes further mention or 
specification of that noun, its individuation will increase, and the 
probability of plural agreement will likewise increase. The following 
Syrian example echoes Belnap's Egyptian ones: while the first verb 
modifying lal-'a_diqa/ friends is feminine, the rest of the sentence shows 
plural agreement (example from Grotzfeld 1965:97, translation mine):

happy-holidays for each-other] 
Friends go to each other's [houses] and wish each other happy 
holidays 
Unfortunately, the Kuwaiti texts I collected have no examples that 
contrast deflected and plural agreement. 
The speaker's perception of the individuation of a noun thus 
affects his or her choice of agreement. If a noun is highly individuated, 
animate, specific, textually prominent, or quantified, the speaker tends 
to choose plural agreement; conversely, if the noun is collective, non­
specific, collective, and less prominent, the agreement will tend to be 
feminine singular. It makes sense to call these agreement patterns 
individuated and collective: individuated agreement referring to the 
use of plural verbs, adjectives, and pronouns, and collective agreement 
to feminine singular modification. These terms reflect the pragmatic 
choice made by the speaker in representing the nature of the entity she 
or he is describing. 
One corollary of the theory that individuation underlies agreement 
patterns is that modified plurals will be more likely to take plural 
agreement than unmodified ones. An unmodified plural noun is less 
likely to be individuated, and thus more likely to be treated as a collective, 
taking a feminine singular verb or predicate, whereas adjectival 
modification automatically makes the noun more specified and thus 
more individuated. Examination of agreement data in the dialects yields 
several indications that agreement patterns of verb and subject differ 
from those of adjectives. 
In Moroccan, Harrell notes that inanimate nouns only rarely, "in 
isolated idioms and stereotyped phrases," take feminine singular 
agreement (1962: 158). My Moroccan corpus contains one instance in 
which a plural noun takes a feminine adjective, and here, the noun in 
question, /masa'il/ things, belongs to the formal register of Arabic, 
which probably explains the feminine singular adjective /qbil.ta/ ugly:

Caubet's Moroccan grammar includes a similar example, also somewhat

There are Indian movies they translate into colloquial 
The formal register of these examples notwithstanding, both contain 
indefinite, non-specific nouns low in individuation, which may also 
play a role in the use of collective agreement. 
Sallam's study of agreement treats adjectival concord in educated 
spoken Arabic of Egypt and the Levant. He finds that non-Egyptians 
showed little acceptance of deflected adjectival agreement with human 
plurals ( 1 979:42-9). The Egyptian pattern of collective (deflected) 
agreement with human groups is well-documented by Belnap (199 1). 
However, my Syrian data and Cowell's grammar contain a number of 
examples in which human plural subjects collocate with a feminine 
singular verb. From my data:

Cowell lists a number of examples containing subjects Inasl people, 
I'ahl/ people, folks, and plurals ending in the feminine leI (a Syrian 
variant of la/) such as Isaggilel workers, and I'asatzel professors 
( 1964:424). All but one of Cowell's examples contain deflected verb­
subject agreement, but not noun-adjective agreement. The exception 
contains two types of agreement with the noun, the plural pronoun 
I-honl them and the feminine adjective Ikbirel large ( 1964:423):

These envelopes [that] you brought are too large 
61 
This case of split agreement reflects a shift in the individuation of 
/mgallafiit/ envelopes: in the subject clause, the speaker identifies a 
specific, identifiable group of envelopes, while the predicate /kbire/ 
big classifies them, in that they all belong to the class of envelopes that 
is too large. 
In addition to adjectival modification, possession adds specificity 
as well. A contrasting pair of Egyptian sentences suggests that possessed 
nouns tend to take individuated rather than collective agreement. The 
first example contains the plural predicate /mitrabbiYin/ raised properly 
modifying /ciyalu/ his children, while the second contains a collective 
verb /bitCalla'/ (3/s) hangs modifying collective /il-ciyal! children:

More evidence may be found in other varieties of Arabic. 
Rosenhouse notes a difference between verb-subject concord and noun­
adjective concord in Palestinian bedouin dialects, such that the former 
tends to be feminine, the latter plura1. (1984a:1 16). And Belnap's study 
of agreement in Classical Arabic results in a much higher percentage of 
pronouns and verbs showing collective agreement than adjectives, 
reflecting the same patterns found in the dialects (1991: 126). In general, 
then, collective (feminine singular) verb-subject agreement occurs more 
frequently than collective singular noun-adjective agreement, and this 
tendency is predicted by the higher degree of individuation associated 
with modified nouns. 

62 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
Within this general pattern, individual dialects appear to show 
some degree of variation. 
Moroccan speakers appear to favor 
individuated (plural) agreement over collective (feminine) agreement, 
a tendency which parallels the Moroccan preference for a higher degree 
of individuation marking (see section 1 .6). Cairene seems to fall at the 
other end of this spectrum: Belnap and Sallam both indicate that 
"Cairenes tend to use deflected [feminine] agreement more than speakers 
of other dialects" (Belnap 199 1  :64). This Cairene tendency to accord 
less syntactic attention to the individuation of nouns is mirrored as well 
in the absence in Egyptian of certain specifying articles and demonstrative 
forms found in other dialects (see Chapters 1 and 4). 
2.3 
Agreement Neutralizationto 
Agreement neutralization refers here to the absence of gender 
(feminine) or number (plural) grammatical agreement marking on verbs 
and adjectives whose subjects or head nouns are feminine or plural. 
Neutralization of adjectival agreement is prevalent in Egypt among 
certain classes of adjectives, and a few isolated cases may be found in 
the Levant and Kuwait. Neutralization of verb-subject agreement can 
occur in verb-initial sentences (VS typology), and represents a more 
general pattern found in most varieties of Arabic. 
2.3.1 Neutralized Adjectival Agreement 
Sallam's (1979) study of concord in the noun phrase examines 
data collected from a number of educated speakers from Egypt and the 
Levant, and notes a pattern of agreement loss or neutralization frequent 
among Egyptian speakers. Building on the research of Mitchell (1956, 
1973), and Wise (1972), Sallam notes that certain adjectives, generally 
belonging to the morphological class of relational adjectives (Arabic 
/nisba/), especially those denoting place of origin or color, often show 
no gender or number agreement. His examples, most of them indefinite, 
include /)a_Ida 'arabi! an Arabic poem, and /rasma nglIzi/ an English 
design (1979:27). In both, the nouns are feminine and the adjectives 
neutralized (masculine). 
1°1 have adapted the term agreement neutralization from Belnap 1991. 

2.3 Agreement Neutralization 
63 
Sallam finds this phenomenon to be far less frequent in the Levant. 
Even so, evidence exists of agreement neutralization on certain relational 
adjectives when modifying nouns of low individuation. Sallam notes 
that most of his informants accept a masculine adjective in the phrase 
/lira libnani/ a Lebanese pound (1979:41). And in the following Syrian 
proverb depicting a first-rate person or thing, the masculine classificatory 
adjective /Eini/ china modifies the feminine noun /zibdiyye/ bowl 
(example from Nelson et al. 1996:424). The low specificity of the 
noun phrase (any china bowl will do) may also help attract neutralized 
agreement.

Individuation thus seems to affect the neutralized agreement 
patterns of certain adjectives. Most of Sallam's examples consist of 
words for nationality, educational classes, such as class or course 
curriculum, and the like; in other words, they provide classificatory 
description (membership in a class) rather than the identification of a 
specific or particular item (1.2). Classificatory adjectives are more 
likely to show neutralized agreement. Sallam's data and Belnap's 
elicitation tasks both center on indefinite nouns, and thus do not provide 
adequate samplings covering the entire individuation continuum. Indirect 

64 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
evidence supporting this analysis lies in the parallel of neutralized 
agreement in Egyptian to the relative frequency of feminine singular 
agreement with plural nouns, as compared to other dialect regions (2.2). 
To really test this theory, however, a full range of both definite and 
indefinite data is needed. 
Sallam's Egyptian data present a particular problem: while (a), 
(b), and (c) below are attested, his informants reject (d) as ungrammatical 
( 1979:25-8; all these nouns are feminine, all the adjectives masculine):

• J ,),J

This pattern can be explained using the individuation hierarchies. The 
masculine adjective /ma_ri/ Egyptian can modify the defmite but abstract 
feminine noun /il-Iahga/ dialect, but not the indefinite but otherwise 
individuated /warda/ rose, flower. The fact that /warda/ one rose can 
be modified by masculine /baladi/ native, unsophisticated is a function 
of the adjective /baladi/. Like other adjectives that tend to take neutralized 
agreement, viz., /tani/ other, another, /'adi/ usual, normal, and /kUrt 
many (Belnap 199 1 :93), /baladi/ describes something completely 
unremarkable, and in that sense, unindividuated.1 1  
An unexpected use of the infrequently used plural adjective /kutar/ 
many, usually neutralized as /kUrt (masculine singular form), not only 
supports this analysis, but also provides a sociolinguistic motivation 
for some of these agreement patterns. Belnap cites a rare instance of 
plural agreement /kutar/ many with both the plural /wuzara/ ministers 
and the (often) collective /nas/ people (1991 :93): 
II Sallam's observation that Ibaladi/ occurs in the feminine in the phrase /magalis 
baladiyya/ local councils (1979:27) is explained by the fact that Ibaladi/ in this 
latter case has a different meaning, referring to the local township (the phrase 
does not mean native or unsophisticated councils). I suspect that the adjective 
/maĝri/ Egyptian functions in a way opposite that of Ibaladi/, at least to some 
extent. For most Egyptian speakers, /maĝri/ carries a highly positive identity 
connotation, and in this sense should tend to show patterns of high individuation. 
A sociolinguistic investigation of this topic might produce interesting results.

people many-p in-the-country 
Many, many ministers, I did work for them ... I worked with 
many people in the country 
The context of this example suggests a reason for the unusual plural 
form /kumrl many. The speaker, a cabinetmaker, cites the many important 
people for whom he has worked. The plural agreement raises the 
individuation of Iwuzaral ministers and Inasl people, heightening the 
speaker's portrayal of them as prominent and powerful individuals. In 
elevating their status, the speaker increases his own status by association, 
since they have sought him out. This use of agreement may reflect a 
kind of sociolinguistic posturing, a way for speakers to signal high 
individuation, and hence status, of themselves and others. 
Sectarian identity in the Levant provides another possible example 
of the social use of agreement. In the following passage, a Syrian 
Christian attributes the rather strict mores of her society to the 
conservative Islamic country in which she lives. In modifying the 
feminine /baladnal our country, the speaker uses feminine adjectives 
Imuta'aEEibel fanatic and Imul)afi!ja/ conservative, but uses the masculine 
form of I'islamil Islamic:

The context and seemingly deliberate use of a masculine Islamic followed 
directly by the feminine conservative suggest a kind of distancing posture 
assumed by the speaker.

Another text from northern Syria contains the noun /'islam/lslam 
(rather than /muslimin/ Muslims) to specify the sectarian identity of 
Muslims who moved into the (Christian) speaker's town of Sulaymaniyya 
(Behnstedt 1989:66, translation mine):

(in it). Then it started getting built up, people started moving 
{there], and now, there, there {have] come to be, you know, 
people, they {have] come to be "Islam" {Muslims]. 
Does the use of /'islam/ Islam in this text also represent linguistic 
posturing? Lebanese informants confirm that the terms /'islam/ lslam 
and /masiĤiyye/ Christian or Christianity are often used by Lebanese 
of both religions to refer to the sectarian identity of groups of people 
(an informant insists that these terms do not refer to the religions 
themselves but rather to people). The use of the nominal form /'islam/ 
rather than the adjective, which would have to be the more individuating 
plural /muslimin/ Muslims, may simply emphasize the collective identity 
rather than the individual. 
As Belnap points out, the search for the purpose of agreement, 
syntactically redundant in many languages, has frustrated linguists for 
years (1991:25). What is the motivation for retaining a syntactic function 
that seems to carry little or no meaning of its own? Perhaps the reason 
lies partly in social meaning. Evidence from spoken Arabic suggests 
that agreement is a feature that allows speakers to claim for themselves 
or others a degree of social status or power, a kind of linguistic posturing. 
Belnap notes among his informants a "general tendency of male 
speakers to favor deflected agreement more than female speakers," 

2.3 Agreement Neutralization 
67 
suggesting this finding as possible evidence of linguistic change in 
progress (1991:95). However, another plausible hypothesis is that social 
identity (in this case, gender) might affect agreement choice. In other 
words, adult male speakers, having a relatively high degree of status or 
agency vis-a-vis other social groups, tend to use non-individuating 
agreement patterns more than less privileged groups. If Belnap's results 
do reflect a general social trend, and if certain social groups use deflected 
agreement patterns to speak about others, the agreement might reflect 
or reinforce their own high status vis-a-vis the lower status of others. 
2.3.2 Verb-Subject Number Agreement 
Verb-initial sentences (V[erb] S[ubject] sentence typology) occur 
in all registers of Arabic. Formal Arabic has a rule that governs verb­
subject neutralization in VS sentences: a verb that precedes its subject 
must show singular agreement. Gender agreement rules normally apply, 
except that a verb separated from its subject may show masculine 
singular agreement regardless of the number or gender of the subject. 
These patterns commonly occur in most dialects as well. 
In VS sentences, then, verb-subject agreement may be neutralized 
in most (if not all) forms of Arabic. Cowell notes that this phenomenon 
most often occurs in Syrian when the subject is indefmite (1964:421-2). 
Belnap notes that this type of agreement pattern "sometimes occur[s]" 
in Egyptian; his example also contains an indefinite subject (1991: 19): 
E 
W* +J/. , ':'L. 
mat-3ms minha 'arbae Eubyan 
died-he from-her four boys 
Four boys of hers died 
Normally, verbal idioms whose subjects express periods of time exhibit 
masculine singular agreement regardless of the subject's number and 
gender. In examples such as the following, the low individuation of 
the time period may affect the degree to which verb and subject agree: 
En

Another example, from Behnstedt and Woidich's rural Egyptian Delta 
texts, introduces a stolen water buffalo. In the first sentence, indefinite 
feminine /gamOsa/ (a) water buffalo is preceded by a masculine singular 
verb, /insara'/ it was stolen, while in the second, the now defined 
/ig-gamOsa/ the water buffalo is preceded by a feminine singular verb 
/insara'it/ it was stolen (Behnstedt and Woidich 1987 :26, translation 
mine):

water-buffalo and got-away-3fs ... 
There [was] one day a man among us who had a water buffalo 
stolen/rom his house. So when the water buffalo was stolen and 
got out ... 
While verb-subject neutralization patterns in spoken Arabic often 
parallel formal Arabic rules, these formal rules themselves reflect the 
same pragmatic principles that other agreement patterns do. One pattern 
that emerges from the examples of verb-subject neutralization cited 
here is that the subject is often indefinite, non-specific, or non-human. 
In other words, these subjects are of low individuation. Another possible 
explanation for the agreement neutralization is that the indefinite subjects 
in some of these cases represent new topics; as such, they carry the 
pragmatic focus of the sentence. The verb, on the other hand, is thematic. 
Perhaps the neutralization of thematic sentence elements, such as 
sentence- or clause-initial verbs, lends greater prominence to the new 
topic. 

2.3 Agreement Neutralization 
69 
Moroccan does not seem to show the same degree of agreement 
neutralization as do other dialects. Harrell and Caubet do not mention 
variation in verb-subject agreement in their grammars of Moroccan, 
and examples I found of verb-subject word order show plural agreement 
even with indefinite nouns, such as the following with plural /zaw/ they 
came preceding /drari/ kids (Caubet 1993ii:273, translation mine): 
M 
c I",.(, ... ؠ <!J1JoJ 1-,4-
zaw drari ysuwwlu <lik 
came-they kids they-ask about-you 
[Some J kids came asking for youl2 
A Moroccan informant confirms this general pattern, and finds the 
singular verb /Za/ unacceptable here, but provides the following minimal 
pair contrasting a plural verb (right) with a neutralized verb (left): 
M 
oJ'(,JI oJ ÜJI 4J ..:.L. 
oJ'(,JI oJ ÜJI 4J IÝL. 
mat-Iha rnb<a d l-wlad 
matu-lha rnb<a d l-wlad 
died-3ms-of-hers 4 gen the-kids 
died-p-of-hers 4 gen the-kids 
She had four kids die 
Four of her kids died 
The translations given for each sentence reflect my informant's 
explanation of the difference in terms of focus between them: in the 
example on the right, the focus is on the children who died, whereas 
the neutralized example on the left focuses on the woman herself. His 
intuition can be rephrased using the individuation hierarchy. In the 
example on the right, the children who died are more individuated, and 
hence plural agreement is used. By contrast, in the sentence on the 
left, the children have lower textual prominence, and hence less 
individuation, which helps to explain the neutralized agreement. 
Moroccan speakers thus tend to favor plural agreement for both 
adjectives and verbs. If substantiated by further research, the lower 
frequency of collective and neutralized agreement variation I perceive 
in Moroccan would provide an interesting parallel to the Moroccan 
tendency to mark individuation, especially in human nouns (1.6). 
12 A Moroccan informant finds this example unusual, preferring f§i drm-il some 
kids to the unmarked Idrm-il kids cited by Caubet. His intuition confirms the 
Moroccan tendency to favor marking individuation in human nouns noted in 
1.6.

2.4 
Genitive and Possessive Constructions 
Spoken Arabic makes use of two constructions to express 
possessive and genitive relationships: the construct phrase (Arabic 
/iQafal) that links two nouns together to specify a genitive or possessive 
relationship between them, and the so-called "analytic" genitive, which 
makes use of a genitive exponent to express that relationship. Harning's 
1980 study of these two constructions includes all documented forms 
of spoken Arabic and is far more detailed and comprehensive than is 
possible here. Her use of the terms synthetic and analytic, respectively, 
to refer to them, and her characterization of the genitive exponent as a 
"dialectal innovation" (1980: 10) reflect a widely shared view that spoken 
Arabic has long been in the process of shifting from a synthetic language 
to an analytic one whose syntactic relationships are expressed through 
strings of discrete morphemes. 
Overlooked in this analysis is that Arabic has, throughout its 
documented history, had a number of alternative constructions to the 
iQlifa. As Harning mentions, a number of "analytic" annexation particles 
are well-documented for Classical Arabic, most common of them /li-/ 
for, belonging to and /min/ of. The dialects also make use of these 
prepositions as genitive markers. Cowell includes among his examples 
two pairs of synonyms, on the left the construct phrase and on the right 
its near equivalent with an exponent ( 1964:460) 
S 
 J ')' I ti.i.!J LA

While it may be argued that the contexts of these preposition­
exponents are limited in scope, the same holds true for the genitive 
exponents in most dialects (the main exception being urban Moroccan). 
Moreover, the construct phrase also has syntactic restrictions: its first 
tenn cannot be indefinite. In the following, the indefinite noun phrase 
/'arba' _ubyan/ four boys cannot take a possessive suffix, and /minha/ 
of hers indicates the possession (example from Belnap 1991: 19): 

2.4 Genitive and Possessive Constructions 
E 
o* +JI '-f.:... ..:.oL. 
mat minha 'arba' oubyan 
died-he from-her four boys 
Four boys of hers died 
71 
The use of /Ii-I in formal Arabic is of particular comparative 
interest here. While it is grammatically possible to translate The Yemeni 
Language Center using a construct phrase, (a), the preferred rendering 
uses the preposition /Ii-I, (b): 
(a) 
CA ઊI ..:.oWJI jS.>-' 
markaz al-Iugat al-yamani 
center (of) the-languages 
the-Yemeni 
(b) 
..:.0 lA1.J ઋ I jS..,.11 
al-markaz al-yamani Ii-I-Iugat 
the-center the-Yemeni 
for-languages 
The preferred title, (b), places a contrastive focus on Language not 
conveyed by (a), and for this reason, presumably, is favored, since the 
title refers to the Yemeni Language Center, as opposed to the Yemeni 
Cultural Center, the Yemeni Trade Center, or any other center in Yemen. 
By contrast, (a) places a focus on Yemeni, and might refer to a Yemeni 
Language Center as opposed to an Egyptian or Saudi Language Center. 
This function of /Ii-I parallels one of the functions of the dialect 
exponents. Cowell provides examples from Syrian, including the 
following minimal pair, of which (a) is preferred over (b) (1964:460): 
(a) 
(b) 
S

$ȮI ડI ";'ઢ 
fars 'I-bet 'z-zdid

the new furniture of the house

I will show that constructions involving the exponents often convey 
specific pragmatic information that the construct phrase does not. The 
choice a speaker makes between the two constructions is governed by 
general principles shared to some extent by most dialect regions, even 
though the frequency of the exponents varies considerably. 
Table 2-1 lists the most common genitive exponents in the four 
dialects:

Gender and number agreement is obligatory only in Egypt. Syrian 
grammars give no feminine form corresponding to Itaba'l; Cowell 
gives two optional plural forms, /taba'atl and Itaba'Ul/ (1964:489). 
Kuwaiti masculine Imall often modifies feminine and plural nouns. 
2.4.1 Harning's Study 
Haming's ( 1980) comparative study of the construct and genitive 
exponents covers all documented Arabic-speaking regions, and explores 
the relative frequency of the genitive exponents and factors that motivate 
their use in Arabic dialects. Haming classifies the genitive exponents 
in six groups, mainly according to frequency, geography, and type of 
society (rural, bedouin, and urban), ranging from Group I, in which the 
exponents are limited to fixed expressions, to Group VI, in which the 
exponent is more productive than the construct (1980: 158-60). She 
notes two "major dividing line(s)," one separating western North Africa 
from the rest of the region, and the other separating urban, rural, and 
bedouin societies (160-61). 
The four dialects studied here represent three of Harning's six 
groups, ranging from the highest frequency count of Moroccan (Harning's 
Group VI) to the second lowest frequency of Kuwaiti and Syrian (Group 
II). In the middle range stands Egyptian (Group IV). 
For the Persian Gulf dialects, Harning lists both /mal/ and /Dagg/ 
as genitive exponents; according to my data, only the former fulfills 
that role in Kuwaiti. Johnstone ( 1967 :90) confirms that Kuwaiti /Dagg/

functions as an indirect object marker that may be used predicatively, 
and has the same meaning as /li-I to,for. From my data:

The following typical examples show that /l,lagg/ usually (but not always) 
precedes nouns, whereas /I-I normally occurs with pronoun objectsɚ

Harning observes that narratives tend to contain a higher percentage 
of exponents than dialogues, and proposes discourse motivation for the 
selection of that particular construction in certain narrative contexts 
( 1980:36-38). 
However, not all narrative contexts are naturally 
conducive to the appearance of exponents. The absence of exponents 
from one of my Kuwaiti narrative texts is to be explained by its topic 
of arranging marriages, since genitive exponents tend not to be used to 
modify familial and marital relationships (for exceptions in Egyptian, 
see 2.4.5). Most of the examples of genitive exponents in my Kuwaiti 
data come from an interview with an elderly, illiterate woman, rather 
than the interviews with the younger, more educated speakers. 
The aim of this brief overview of genitive constructions in the 
dialects is to investigate possible formal and pragmatic constraints or 
factors motivating the choice of construction. Harning's study makes 
several important observations about what she calls "stylistic" factors, 
which may be more precisely described as pragmatic and discourse 
functions. She notes, for example, that certain climactic passages in 
narratives tend to contain exponent phrases that give more weight to 

74 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
the passage, and that in parallel genitive constructions, the longer, 
weightier exponent phrases tend to occur at the end of the list, as a 
signal of closure (1980:37, 91, 143). 
Rather than viewing the choice between the construct and the 
exponent phrase as a choice between "two parallel genitive systems" 
signalling "a dynamic process of language development" (Harning 
1980: 1), the exponent is better viewed as belonging to the same system 
as the construct, just as /li-I and other prepositions have always provided 
alternatives to the construct in formal Arabic. The speaker chooses 
between a coɛstruct and an exponent on the basis of formal, semantic, 
and pragmatic considerations that will now be examined. 
2.4.2 Formal Motivations for the Use of the Genitive Exponent 
In a study of the genitive construction in North African dialects, 
Mars:ais (1977) points out that the morphological form and weight of 
the phrase play a role in the choice between the construct and an 
exponent. He attributes the use of the latter to a multi-term noun 
phrase, suffixed or otherwise modified nouns, or to a phrase in which 
direct annexation would "disfigure" the syllabic structure ( 1977:17 1). 
Harning lists similar motivations for the use of exponents in Kuwaiti 
( 1980:35-6), Egyptian (90), and Syrian (52). 
Borrowed words of foreign origin and words ending in a long 
vowel in general cannot take pronoun suffixes and do not readily fit 
into Arabic morphosyntactic patterns; therefore, they tend to occur 
with a possessive exponent rather than in a construct (see el-Tonsi 
1982i: 16). Duals (excluding the pseudo-dual parts of the body) also 
tend not to be used in construct phrases (Harning 1980:61 ;  el-Tonsi 
1982i: 16; Mars:ais 1977: 17 1), perhaps because of the morphological 
awkwardness of adding a suffix to the dual suffix I-en/. Pragmatics 
might play a role here as well, because the dual ending often indicates 
a degree of individuation, a factor that tends to favor the use of the 
genitive exponent. 
The main formal motivations for the choice of the exponent 
include: multi-term annexation (three or more nouns), the presence of 
modifying adjectives, and parallel phrases with more than one head

Cowell gives two possible Syrian variants formy uncle's gasoline station, 
both of which contain exponents (1964:461). The variant on the right 
carries an emphasis on gasoline, while the one on the left highlights my 
uncle as possessor. In each case, the exponent focuses attention on a 
particular piece of infonnation:

The following Kuwaiti sentence contains a complex phrase consisting 
of three nouns, one of which is a possessive pronoun: Irab'l friends, 
/hal her, and lil-madrasel the school. It is syntactically impossible to 
append a noun after a possessive pronoun, so this speaker has little 
choice but to use the exponent Imal/: 
K3 r+>.l.;J.,J 4-' .:.l:!,J l.f.:.న 4....J.l.l.1 JL. ఩.J

friends-her gen the-school they-come-to-her and came-she mother­
her and threw-out-them 
Her friends from school would visit her and her mother came 
and threw them out 
These structural factors parallel the pragmatics of infonnation 
packaging. In the following section, I will show that the use of exponents 
allows a focus on the possessor not present in the construct phrase. 
Another possible motivation for avoiding multi-tenn constructs may lie 
in the ambiguity of the multiple relationships. In processing two 
possessive relationships at the same time, it may help the listener to 
know which one carries particular weight or focus. Hence, structural 
and pragmatic considerations seem to be at least partly related.

2.4.3 Pragmatic Functions 
Haming notes for individual dialect areas "stylistic factors" that 
influence the choice of genitive construction, including the introduction 
of a new theme and contrast (1980:37-8, 63-4, 91 -2). This observation 
may be more precisely phrased ill pragmatic terms: the genitive exponents 
fulfill specific pragmatic functions that the construct phrase does not. 
First, the exponent places a focus on the possessing noun (in linear 
terms, the second noun) not conveyed by the construct phrase. In 
addition, the exponent lends a possessive phrase greater textual 
prominence, signalling a relatively high degree of individuation, 
contrastive focus, or the first mention of an entity in discourse. These 
features naturally overlap; thus it is not surprising to find more than 
one at work in many cases. 
The exponent is likely to occur in genitive phrases that are specified 
or individuated. Cowell points out that Syrian /taba'/ generally indicates 
identificatory annexion, and only rarely classificatory (1964:461). It is 
often used to express professional relationships, such as his officer in 
the following: 1 3  
S2 
ౙǵౚI  
i<;l-<;labit taba'u

his officer 
In the following passage, the Egyptian speaker describes how an 
insect crawled into her ear. The insect is highly individuated, textually 
prominent and has the power to cause the speaker pain, all factors 
which help attract the use of the genitive exponent /bita'/ in the phrase 
/l-miswar bita'ha/ its journey.

\J As Diem (1986) has shown, the concept of alienability helps explain why 
genitive exponents are not generally used to express relationships involving 
family and parts of the body, which are inalienable relationships.

[The insect] entered, entered as far as the [ear]drum, not being

The exponent can also add contrastive focus to a genitive phrase, 
usually to the possessor. In this Moroccan example, the girl's possession 
of the room is singled out and contrasted in the absolute, her very own 
room: 
Ml l u.J.:.,H lfJ4.J : I  lfJ J I.J vAl.:.." .iJu..L.. d1.. uL;>

Her father was a king, a sultan, and he up and made for her her 
very own room (suite) 
The next passage contains both constructs and exponents, first the 
construct, /waldha/ her son, then the exponent, /l-wald dyalha/ her son 
(in boldface). After the first mention of the son, in construct, the 
narrator explicitly contrasts the identity of the man's two wives. The 
second mention of the son contains the exponent /dyaiha/ her [own] in 
reference to the man's first wife, highlighting the focus on her identity 
as possessor, while simultaneously emphasizing the horror of her deed:

'''he occurrence of /d/ in /1.01. d 1-'yliHit/ two wives is not a true possessive, 
but marks the specification of a quantity, in this case two. Moroccan /d/ 
fulfills this syntactic role for quantities between two and ten.

She said to him, 'Husband, the woman ate her son-this is the

Kuwaiti /mal/ often occurs in phrases contrasting with other named 
or implied entities. In the first example, the speaker uses /mal/ to 
contrast the forgetfulness of old age with that other kind. In the second, 
she contrasts love in the old days with love in the post-oil era:

Nouns that play a role as discourse topic, that is, figure importantly 
in a narrative, often attract special syntactic marking ( 1 .5, 2. 1). Genitive 
phrases with exponents often play a role as discourse topic. In the 
following, the hair of a lion will play a discourse role in the story, 
hence its first mention is marked with /mal/: 
K3 
_ JL. ` B a bJJ 
rilĤi ylbI-li sa'ar mal sibi' 
go-f bring-f hair gen lion 
Go bring me a hair of a lion 

2.4 Genitive and Possessive Constructions 
79 
Another factor at work in this example is the identity of the possessor. 
Although the genitive phrase remains indefinite, the identity of the 
possessor is implicitly contrasted, since the woman is requested to get 
the hair of a lion, not the hair of any other animal. 
Haming found Syrian to have one of the lowest frequencies of 
genitive exponents of any urban dialects (1980: 158). One reason for 
this low frequency may be that Syrian speakers have at their disposal 
another construction that helps the speaker package (and helps the 
listener process) genitive information. This construction is the so-called 
"object marker" /la-/ (see further 10.3.5). The following example 
contains a complex possessive construction consisting of four terms, 
/sikirter(t)/ secretary, /mar(t)/ wife, /ra'is/ president, and fmally /hj-jam'a/ 
the university. The genitive is formed in a two-step process: first, the 
secretary's relationship to a female figure is established using a possessive 
pronoun, /sikirtert[h]a/ her secretary, then the second figure is defined 
as /mart ra'is hj-jam'a/ the president of the university's wife, using a 
three-term construct. The larger possessive consists of two parts, both 
genitive constructs, combined using the resumptive topic marker /la-/ 
(see further 10.3.5), which places a topical focus on the latter term. 
S5

sikirtert[h]a la-mart ra'is ij-jam'a da"it talifon

The secretary of the president of the university's wife called 
Although the primary function of /la-/ involves marking a resumptive 
topic, it often occurs in genitive constructions, where it fulfills a role 
similar to that of genitive /taba'/ in that both particles allow the speaker 
to order and rank the relationships among multiple terms in a way that 
aids the listener to keep track of them. In Egyptian, the only acceptable 
way to express this idea would contain genitive /hita'/ (or feminine 
/bita'it/): 
E

The secretary of the wife of the president of the university 

80 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
Egyptian /bita'/ shares with Syrian /taba'/ syntactic restrictions 
and most semantic and pragmatic functions, the main exception being 
the greater Egyptian use of /bita'/ in defining social relationships, as 
contrasted to Syrian /taba'/ (see 2.4.5). From this perspective, the 
discrepancy Haming finds between the frequency of the exponents in 
these two urban areas is unexpected. However, the availability of /la-/ 
to Syrian speakers as an infonnation packaging device helps to explain 
both the lower frequency of /taba'/ and why Syrian speakers tend not to 
use it as often in describing social relationships. 
2.4.4 Exponents and Individuation 
The genitive exponents tend to reflect a high degree of specification 
or individuation as contrasted with the construct phrase. Syrian and 
Egyptian exponents seem to be limited to this pragmatic function for 
the most part. Moroccan and Kuwaiti, on the other hand, allow exponents 
to classify (rather than individuate) nouns. In syntactic terms, the 
exponents in Moroccan and Kuwaiti are more frequently used to modify 
indefinite nouns and/or nonspecific possessors than their Egyptian and 
Syrian counterparts. 
Haming notes "qualification" as a common semantic characteristic 
of exponent phrases, but she does not make the distinction that Cowell 
does between classification and identification. Thus her examples of 
"qualification" include the use of exponents to individuate, such as 
Egyptian /il-kitab bita' is-sil:lr/ the book of magic, which clearly refers 
to a specific book (87) and Moroccan /l-ma d[] l-bakor/ Ie jus des 
figue-fleurs [sap of unripe figs 1 (136), a classificatory identification. 
It is important to make this distinction between classification 
(generic identity, low individuation) and identification (specific identity, 
high individuation), because it corresponds to a difference in the usage 
of the exponents in the dialects. Moroccan and Kuwaiti speakers use 
their exponents to classify and individuate, while Egyptian and Syrian 
speakers generally use the exponent to individuate but not to classify 
(except in certain idiomatic expressions noted below). 
The following examples from Moroccan and Kuwaiti data show 
the exponents qualifying or classifying, but not individuating the nouns 

2.4 Genitive and Possessive Constructions 
81 
they modify. The nouns that constitute the first tenns of these genitive 
phrases are all indefinite, and the possessors are generic rather than 
specific. The genitive phrase as a whole is thus low in individuation:

women, the inventions of old women 
In contrast to these Moroccan and Kuwaiti examples, in which 
the genitive exponent is used to classify rather than individuate, the 
following Egyptian example shows /hita'/ in an individuating phrase. 
Although the first noun /Qaga/ thing is indefmite and non-specific, the 
high individuation of /rabbina/ God allows the exponent /hita'it/, since 
a thing 0/ God's is unique among all other things: 
ElO L.:..:aJ dǬ 46.., ఠ., t.....l IJ d:aట ..:.J.l L. <:,j

Lord-our 
Like I told you, Ma'am, this is/ate, and something of God's 
Syrian and Egyptian infonnants reject constructions with non-
specific possessors as weak. Grammars of both dialects confinn: Cowell 
remarks that it is rare for Syrian /taba'/ to annex an indefinite possessor 
(1964:489); for Egyptian, el-Tonsi specifies a limited set of idiomatic, 

82 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
predicated contexts in which /hita'/ can annex an indefinite noun 
( 1982i:20). 
One of the few instances in which Egyptian and Syrian exponents 
/hita'/ and /taba'/ annexes an indefinite possessor is a shared idiomatic 
expression meaning someone who likes (a meaning I have not found 
for Moroccan /dyal/ or Kuwaiti /mal/):

I'm not all talk [and no action] 
This particular use of the exponent is not limited to urban dialects, 
however. Even conservative Najdi speakers make use of a parallel 
construction, /fed/, which Ingham defines as (1994: 182):15 
a possessive particle Ifed-ihl something belonging to him, 
concerned with him, also used meaning a sort of person fond of 
. . .  as in lana mani fed hassuwalifl I am not the sort of person 
who likes this sort of thing. 
Exponents derived from nouns show varying degrees of 
grammatical agreement governed by the head noun. For Egyptian 
/hita'/, agreement is obligatory according to most sources (Harning 
1980:85, el-Tonsi 1982i: 14). Kuwaiti and Syrian exponents, on the 
other hand, show agreement only occasionally. In the first example, 
plural /malot/ agrees with /l->ashum/ stocks, but in the second, masculine 
/mall modifies feminine /jam'a/ university. 
The first context is 
individuating, as particular stocks are indicated, whereas the second is 
merely descriptive, as the elderly, uneducated speaker does not know 
or remember the name of the university:

Cowell's examples include plural forms /taba'at/ and taba'OI/. In the 
following, the contrasting agreement on /taba'/, first singular then plural, 
may reflect the relative importance of the pictures to each speaker. 
The first speaker lays no claim to them, and uses neutralized agreement; 
the second, on the other hand, owns the pictures, and in claiming 
possession, perhaps emphasizes their uniqueness or importance to him 
or her by using the plural /taba'Oll (example from Cowell 1964:489):

Moroccan /dyall, derived from a particle rather than a noun, does not 
show agreement in urban dialects.16 
The partial agreement of certain exponents may find explanation 
in the individuation of the modified noun: the more individuated the 
genitive phrase, the greater the tendency for the exponent to agree in 
number and gender. 
Further evidence supporting this analysis is 
Haming's observation that agreement tends to be marked on /mall if 
the modifier is a personal pronoun suffix (1980:27), that is, in the 
framework used here, if the phrase as a whole is more individuated. 
2.4.5 Sociolinguistic Motivations 
Haming's study concludes by hypothesizing sociocultural reasons 
for the higher frequency and distribution of the analytic genitive in 
urban dialect groups. Haming notes that urban dialects tend to show a 
higher frequency of exponent phrases than rural or bedouin ones, 
'6Harning cites a claim by Levi-ProvenΎ1 that a certain rural dialect of Moroccan 
has feminine and plural forms of /dyal/: /dyalt-/ and /dyaul/, but can find no 
attested occurrences (Harning 1980:132). 

84 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
attributing this high frequency to the heterogeneity of urban society 
and the rapid social changes that can occur in such environments 
(1980: 164-5). Evidence supporting this analysis includes the use of 
exponents to indicate certain kinds of extrafamilial social relationships. 
Egyptian speakers appear to employ the most highly developed 
system of exponent use, reflecting a highly marked social order.17 EI. 
Tonsi provides a detailed explanation of the use of /hita'/ to describe 
relationships between two human beings (adapted from 1 982i:15): 
For human relationships the use of bitii< is limited to four circles: 
1. Wifels (husband in rural dialects); euphemistic expressions for 
girlfriend and boyfriend. 
2. Relationships with people lower in the social pyramid. 
3. Relationships with people higher in job classification. 
4. Service-based relationships with professionals. 
In other words, Egyptian speakers usually use /hita'/ to define 
relationships that are alienable, temporary, or contractual. Intuitively it 
seems possible that the physical distance caused by the exponent's 
separation of the two nouns might reflect relational distance as well. 
The use of the exponent in such cases may reinforce the social distance 
involved in these hierarchical and contractual relationships. 
Professional relationships in other dialects appear to be expressed 
with an exponent optionally. In my Syrian data, a distancing authority 
is signalled with the exponent (see also Haming 1980:57):

In the opposite direction socially, I have heard in Lebanon both /oan'';Jtna/ 
and /';Jo-oan'a ta'itna/ for our maid (Cowell confirms the use of both 
constructions in Syrian, 1964:460). 
My Kuwaiti corpus contains one example of /mal! modifying a 
human, the guard of the lion: 
17For a sociolinguistic study of social hierarchy in Egypt, see Parkinson (1985). 
18However, lis-sitt bita<til is necessitated by the use of Isittil to mean my

However, the context here is that of a general statement, rather than a 
specific driver of a specific woman. The exponent tends to be used in 
cases which indicate a degree of specificity of either party, or both. 
At the other end of the continuum, Moroccan speakers can use 
/dyal/ to refer to any human relationship, even immediate family:

2.4.6 Moroccan/ dyall 
Of all the exponents in the four dialect regions, Moroccan /dyal/ 
(variant /d/) shows the highest frequency.19 Haming concludes that the 
exponent phrase is more productive than the construct, except in limited 
contexts of intimate relationships (1980: 160; see Harrell 1962: 194-201 
for a list of "limited" contexts in which the construct is normally used). 
This high frequency is due at least in part to the wider range of syntactic 
roles that Moroccan /dyal/ plays compared to its counterparts. 
19Haming and Fischer and lastrow, among others, claim that the particle 
/dyaJ/ is "always" (Haming 1980:1 15) or "usually" (Fischer and lastrow 
1980:93) used with pronoun suffixes. Not only is that notion dismissed by 
several informants, but my data contain numerous counter-examples to such 
claims. 

86 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
Moroccan /dyal/ occurs in various semantic and syntactic contexts 
in which other exponents are rarely, if ever, used. One of these contexts 
is quantification with numbers from two to ten, which may not be 
expressed with the construct in other dialects.w

In most dialects, the genitive exponent may not modify an inalienable 
noun, but Moroccan /dyal/ often does:

These examples show that Moroccan /dyal/ functions as a genitive 
case-marking particle that marks not only possession, but also 
20Harning notes that a (century-old) text from the southwestern Moroccan 
dialect of Houwara uses /nta'/ as the normal genitive exponent (as does the 
entire region), but contains /d/ in the quantifying phrase /s΋b'a d-I-U1ad/ seven 
sons (1980: 131). 

2.5 Summary 
87 
quantification, which the exponents of the other dialects may not do. 
The higher frequency of Moroccan /dyal/ is thus partly explained by its 
greater functional capacity. 
Chapter 1 demonstrated that animacy and specification seem to 
affect definite marking in Moroccan nominal phrases in such a way 
that Moroccan speakers tend to prefer definite marking on animate and 
specified nouns. It seems possible that the high frequency of /dyal/ 
relative to exponents of other dialects may be partly related to the 
relatively wider use of the definite article in Moroccan speech, since 
/dyal/ allows the definite article to be retained on one or both nouns in 
a genitive phrase. 
2.5 
Summary 
This chapter has explored the influence of individuation on two 
types of noun modification, number agreement and possession. The 
discussion of number agreement included an exploration of the category 
of dual in spoken Arabic. 
Examination of various phenomena of dual number and agreement 
led to several conclusions and a hypothesis concerning its historical 
development. Building on Blanc's distinction between dual and pseudo­
dual (1970), I proposed further distinctions between productive and 
non-productive, and specific and non-specific duals. The category of 
dual consists of several different kinds of dual: frozen fonns, most of 
which refer to body parts, a non-specific dual meaning a couple of, and 
a "new topic" dual that has specific pragmatic functions and is limited 
to individuated nouns. The productivity of the dual suffix /-en/ on 
nouns appears to be limited, either to certain classes of words in some 
cases, or to pragmatic functions in others. Periphrastic dual fonns 
appear to be the nonn in Morocco and Kuwait; and the dual suffix 
/-ayn/ is not a productive fonn in Morocco. This evidence led to a call 
for a reevaluation of the history of the dual in spoken Arabic, one that 
takes into account category-specific developments. 
Number agreement patterns in the dialects were shown to be 
affected by the hierarchy of individuation. The agreement of adjectives, 
verbs and pronouns tends to be plural if the noun is highly individuated, 

88 
Number, Agreement, and Possession 
i.e., is specific, definite, and/or high in textual or social prominence, an 
agreement pattern called here individuated plural agreement. By contrast, 
plural nouns that reflect collective, abstract, non-specific, and/or 
inanimate entities of low textual prominence tend to attract feminine 
singular or deflected verb and pronoun agreement (adjectival agreement 
less so, because adjectives tend to specify, giving the nouns they modify 
greater individuation). This latter agreement pattern is designated as 
collective plural agreement. 
Similarly, the individuation of a possessive phrase, and particularly 
the possessor, influences the choice of genitive construction, such that 
the more individuated the phrase as a whole, or one of its members, the 
more likely the speaker to express that relationship using a genitive 
exponent. Formal and sociolinguistic motivating factors for the use of 
the exponent were also noted. 
Within this general shared framework, slight variations occur. 
Moroccan speakers seem to have a greater tendency to use plural 
agreement patterns than speakers of other dialects. This tendency 
provides an interesting parallel to the high frequency of the genitive 
exponent /dyal/ in Moroccan, and also the greater use of definite and 
specifying articles in Moroccan noted in Chapter 1 .  
A distinction i s  found between the two central dialects on the 
one hand and the two peripheral dialects on the other in the use of the 
genitive exponent (as opposed to the construct). Moroccan and Kuwaiti 
speakers can use genitive exponents to indicate classificatory as well as 
individuated identity, while Egyptians and Syrians tend to restrict the 
use of the exponents to individuated phrases. The fact that the Moroccan 
exponent /dyal/ has a much higher frequency than Kuwaiti /mal/ is 
probably due in part to the Moroccan tendency to mark individuation 
in nouns and to its wider syntactic range (/dyal/ also quantifies nouns 
between two and ten in number). Even so, this parallel between Moroccan 
and Kuwaiti in the use of genitive exponents bears watching for future 
developments. 

3 RELATIVE CLAUSES

Introduction 
Ferguson (1959:630) includes the definite relative pronoun JilIi/ 
as one of fifteen features common to most modem Arabic dialects. I 
Grammars of the dialects concur: Mitchell (1956:57) notes that the 
definite relative pronoun for Egyptian is /ilIi/; Cowell (1964:494) lists 
for Syrian /halli/ and /yalli/ as variants of /illi/;2 Johnstone (1967) gives 
filIi! for Kuwaiti; and Harrell (1962:164) notes /lli/ and /ad/ for Moroccan. 
These grammars specify that /ilIi! only relativizes a definite head noun, 
and that no relative pronoun is used if the head noun is indefinite. 
In his Moroccan grammar, Harrell claims that /lli/ in definite 
relative clauses "indicates specifically that the subordinate clause is a 
restrictive adjectival modifier" of the head noun (1962: 164). This 
claim is not made for any other dialect, and it is refuted for Moroccan 
by this counter-example from my data in which /lli/ modifies the already 
restricted /I-walida/, [my] mother: 
M2 Ħ.J " '!Þ .:.4- .}J1 ioU I"J I ǡJlA. .:.:ats 
kant xarfa l-walida iii fat 'ndi hiyya w 'ammti 
was-she going-out the-mother reI came-she at-me she and aunt-my 
My mother, who had come to my house, she and my aunt, was 
going out 
This example shows that /ilIi! can modify both restricted and non­
restricted nouns in Moroccan, as it can in the other three dialect regions. 
IRelativization in formal Arabic utilizes a set of definite relative pronouns 
inflected for gender and number (see Cantarino 1975iii:162), which contrast 
with the invariant pronoun lillil used in spoken Arabic. 
2It is not clear whether Iyalli/, /hallil and lilli! are free variations or reflect 
some nuance of meaning. Some of Cowell's examples suggest that Iyallil 
tends to be restrictive, whereas /hallil appears to be parallel to anaphoric 
demonstrative /hal in that the reference is to an established or otherwise 
identifiable referent, and is thus non-restrictive (Cowell 1964:495-8; see also 
4.2). Cowell has few examples of lilli/, whereas my northern Syrian texts 
contain only lilIi/; this discrepancy may reflect regional differences. Cowell 
prefers to call these particles attributives, since in his view they do not correspond 
to the English relative pronouns (1964:495).

Relative Clauses 
Relativization in spoken Arabic thus seems at first glance to be 
almost uniform and highly analogous to the rules of literary Arabic in 
its distinction between definite and indefinite head nouns and clauses, 
the existence of a definite relative pronoun and the absence of an 
indefinite one, and the lack of distinction between restrictive and non­
restrictive clauses. Formal Arabic and most of the dialects make use of 
what Keenan and Comrie (1977) call case-marking relativizing strategy; 
in Arabic relative clauses, a resumptive pronoun normally marks the 
syntactic position of the relativized noun.3 
However, relativization in the four dialect regions turns out to be 
more complicated, and more interesting, than this simplified picture 
suggests. 
Relative clauses in spoken Arabic include a variety of 
structures. First, the pronoun lillil can relativize not only definite 
nouns, but also indefinite nouns, in all four dialect regions. Second, 
while lillil clauses normally leave a resumptive pronoun in the position 
of the relativized noun, the resumptive pronoun in the direct object 
position is optional in many varieties of Arabic.4 Among the four 
regions examined here, Moroccan speakers in particular regularly omit 
the resumptive pronoun in direct object position, whereas Egyptian and 
Syrian speakers regularly reject its omission. My Aleppan data contain 
lillil clauses in which the head noun of the relative clause stands in 
construct (li<;lafal) with lillil, rather than the more usual noun-modifier 
construction in which the head noun is marked definite. At the same 
time, the function of lillil extends beyond relative clauses. Several 
dialects use lillil as nominalizer andlor sentential complementizer in 
certain contexts that will be explored here. 
Relativization with particles other than lillil, while limited 
geographically, is of comparative interest. While non-attributive relative 
clauses headed by lillil are found in all areas, non-specific, non-attributive 
relative pronouns Imal and Iminl appear only in certain areas: Imal 
3Keenan and Comrie (1977) differentiate between word order relatives and 
case-marking relatives. The former is exemplified by English, in which the 
relativized position is moved to the head of the clause, while Arabic typifies 
the latter, leaving a resumptive pronoun as a "case-marker" of the relativized 
noun. In the case of relativized subjects, the pronoun is normally expressed as 
a verbal prefix, suffix, or circumfix, according to verb morphology. 
4For Classical Arabic examples, see Wright (l898ii:320). 

3.1 Relativization of Indefinite-Specific Nouns with /illi/ 
91 
something, anything occurs only in my Moroccan data and Iminl 
someone, anyone only in Syrian.s The existence of non-specific relative 
pronouns provides an important parallel to the existence of an indefinite­
specific article {§il in these two dialects (1.4). Moroccan speakers also 
have at their disposal an additional relativizing strategy in which oblique 
objects may be relativized with pronoun lia§! in a word-order type 
relative clause. The final section documents examples of a relative 
pronoun Idl and variants in the speech of an elderly woman originally 
from rural northern Morocco. 
How do speakers of these dialects manage this range of relative 
structures? A comparison of the contexts and types of nouns that 
appear in these various clauses reveals that the degree of individuation 
of the head noun affects the strategy used to relativize it. The more 
individuated the noun, the greater the tendency to use the standard lilli! 
clause with resumptive pronoun. Temporal nouns, lower on the scale 
of individuation, have greater tendency to be relativized without 
resumptive pronouns. The use of lilIiI as nominalizer or sentential 
complementizer often occurs when a highly individuated noun appears 
anywhere in the preceding clause, suggesting that high individuation 
affects not only the noun phrase but also the sentence as a whole.6 
This chapter will examine these relative structures and other clauses 
involving lillil in the four dialect areas. 
3.1 
Relativization of Indefinite-Specific Nouns with filIiI 
The grammars of Cowell 1964 (Syrian), Harrell 1962 (Moroccan), 
Mitchell 1956 (Egyptian) and Holes 1990 (Gulf) all state that, in the 
construction of relative clauses, definite head nouns require the relative 
pronoun lillil, whereas indefinite head nouns do not admit it. Examples 
of definite relative clauses from each'dialect region: 
éese two pronouns are reflexes of fonnal Arabic relatives /mat and /man/. 
Wright defines these relative pronouns as "either definite or indefinite" 
(1898ii:319), but a better description according to the analysis proposed here 
would be "partly specified." 
6Cf. Hopper and Thompson's (1980) theory of transitivity, which argues for 
a symbiotic relationship among various sentence constituents such that features 
of "high transitivity," e.g., nominal salience, agency, perfective verbal aspect, 
tend to co-occur in highly transitive clauses.

3.1 Reiativization of Indefinite-Specific Nouns with fillil 
93 
Based on this description and these examples, then, the use of the 
definite relative /ilIi/ appears to be controlled by the definiteness of the 
head noun of the clause. However, data from all dialects contain 
examples in which an indefinite head noun is relativized using the 
definite /ilIi/. Such data constitute clear violations of the "rules" for 
relative clause formation. While it might be argued that such sentences 
represent performance errors on the part of the speaker, the repeated 
occurrence of this structure should not be dismissed without further 
investigation. The traditional view that a head noun "controls" the 
syntax of a modifying clause cannot account for a range of naturally 
occurring data in which the structure of the modifying clause is at odds 
with the definiteness of the head noun. Rather, both the marking of the 
head noun and the marking of the relative clause are controlled by the 
speaker, who can combine definite and indefinite markings to indicate 
a range of specificity. 
All four dialects allow indefinite head nouns to be relativized 
with the definite relative marker /ilIi/ (or Syrian variant /yalIi/). A 
Moroccan informant supplied the following example (based on a sentence 
cited by Harrell 1962: 165): 
M3

serial is modified by a clause headed by the defmite relative /(i)lli/:

To test for performance error, this sentence was repeated to two other 
Egyptian speakers, and both found it perfectly acceptable. Subsequent 

94 
Relative Clauses 
observation of Egyptian speakers has confirmed that similar examples 
occur with some regularity. 
The individuation hierarchy provides a principled explanation 
for this syntactic behavior. In the example given above, the speaker 
appears to have in mind a specific serial program. He introduces this 
program using the indefinite form because he assumes that it is unfamiliar 
to or unidentifiable by his interlocutors, but at the same time, the use of 
/illil implies a particular, and presumably identifiable, serial. The noun 
in this case is thus not entirely indefinite, but rather falls in the indefinite­
specific range. Lacking a syntactic indefinite-specific marker, however, 
the speaker utilizes a combination of indefinite and definite markings 
across the clause to represent the specific identity of the serial. 
Cowell notes that "some [Syrian] speakers occasionally use /yalli/ 
to introduce clauses that are attributive to an indefinite term" ( 1964:499).7 
Cowell has no explanation for this infraction other than that "some 
speakers occasionally" do this (1964:499); to leave it at that would 
suggest thaАas many native speakers of Arabic believe-colloquial has 
no rules. The answer here, as above, seems to lie in the indefmite-specific 
quality of the relativized nouns. Similar to the Egyptian example given 
above, the head noun in Cowell's data appears to fall in the indefinite­
specific range; here, the speaker clearly has a specific entity in mind

The inability of the definite/indefinite marking dichotomy to 
predict the occurrence/absence of the relative pronoun /illi/ shows that 
specificity is a feature that can extend beyond the noun to the noun 
phrase as a whole, affecting the interaction of nouns with modifiers. In 
the next example from Kuwait, the speaker uses the definite /illi/ to 
relativize the indefinite noun /bnayyal girl. The speaker combines 
lSimilarly, Feghali's study of Lebanese syntax concludes that fellif can be 
used with indefinite as well as definite nouns and gives several examples 
resembling those cited here (1928:31 1).

This construction may be contrasted to the (normative) alternate, /bnayya 
tnasib-la/, which would mean a/any girl that would suit him, the identity 
of such a girl being less specific. 
In a number of examples of this type, the head noun is human, 
including /bnayya/ girl in the previous Kuwaiti example and /rayyal/ 
man in the next:

Look, if -- whenever there is a man who loves [his] wife, see, my 
daughter, neither the words of his family nor anyone else's words

Similarly, the following Syrian example contains the indefinite human 
noun /nas/ people relativized with /yalli/ (Cowell 1964:499): 
S 
..u"J.I I੸I ȥ U"L:. ੵ ੶ wlS ..:.J.,JI dl੷

[in-that the-time was-it there-is many people reI exploited-they

At that time there were a lot of people who took advantage of the 
situation 
Since humanness is one of the most important features in the hierarchy 
of individuation, the tendency of this mixed marking to occur with 
human nouns lends further support to the theory that the individuation 
of a head noun can affect the syntax of relative clauses. 

96 
Relative Clauses 
One might then ask why speakers only occasionally make use of 
this pattern, since indefinite nouns described by relative clauses by 
definition have a degree of specificity. In the following example, the 
speaker mentions an American friend who arrived recently, using an 
indefinite relative clause (Cowell 1964:497). 
S 
.l3 1 t ..L:!Ż 401 SlSTi J-:! <!  
fi 'andi _adi' 'amerkani 'za zdid 'al-Бlad 
[there-is at-me friend American came-he new to-the-country] 
1 have an American friend who has just recently come to this 
country 
The speaker obviously has a particular person in mind, and the combined 
features of specificity and animacy might be expected to "push" the 
speaker towards using /illi/ as an indication of the heightened specificity 
of the noun. However, native informants much prefer the indefinite 
clause to a definite clause introduced by /illi/. The following sentence 
was deemed unlikely to occur: 
S 
.l3 1 t ..L:!Ż 401 QI SlSTi J-:! <!  " 
*fi 'andi _adi' 'amerkani iii 'za Mid 'al-'blM 
*there-is at-me friend American rei came-he new to-the-country 
*1 have an American friend who has just recently come to this 
country 
The best explanation for these seemingly paradoxical data appears to 
lie in the pragmatic role of the noun itself. In this sentence, the noun 
/_adi' 'amerkani/ an Americanfriend represents an entity being introduced 
for the first time. The speaker needs to establish both the new identity 
and the topical role of the person, and therefore must mark the noun as 
indefinite. Pragmatic and discourse roles thus also play a role in 
determining the use of definite and indefinite markings in relative clauses. 
Relativization also provides further evidence that nouns marked 
with new-topic article /wal:tid/ (Moroccan /wal:td 1-/; see 1.5) fall within 
the indefinite range of the definiteness continuum. In all dialects, 
nouns marked with this article are modified as indefinite nouns (Harrell 
specifies this rule for Moroccan, 1962: 165). In the following, /wal:td 
r-rzl/ one foot heads an indefinite relative clause /fih buzllOm/ it has 

3.1 Reiativization of Indefinite-Specific Nouns with lillil 
97 
arthritis. Here, the absence of the defInite Illi/ "balances" the specifying 
article Iwal,tSd l/ sc that the combination of syntactic markings does not 
overly "weight" the noun with defIniteness. 
M9 r.,jj-,";, ( .:Jw,6. ౥.,J' oA.'.J 4.J dJ.J c,t!"i ఈ JU 
qal liyya 'azi dlak-Iu wal,tad r-dal J:tadak f"lh buzallum 
said-he to-me come rub for-him one the-foot may-it-avoid-you 
in-it arthritis 
He told me, come and massage for him a leg that had-may you 
be spared-arthritis 
In contrast, Moroccan nouns with indefInite-specifIc article źi/ 
are commonly relativized with /Ilil (Harrell 1962: 165). Harrell cites an 
example containing źi tumubIl/ a car (1962:165):

I want a car that will run good 
More difficult to explain is the following Kuwaiti example, in 
which clearly non-specifIc lay by/ anything is modifIed using /illi/: 
K2 
.ੰ vl' '!' .&:!..,...6. z, {, r' us.:.. Þ¹ '!'

any thing at-you problem Umm Ahmed we present. any thing reI 
you-want 
Any kind of problem you have, Umm Ahmed, we're here. Any 
thing that you want 
The probable explanation for the use of defInite /illi/ here is that the 
speaker wishes to give prominence to lay by/ anything, to stress that 
every single request will be granted. 
Speakers from Egypt, Syria, and Kuwait thus make use of a 
combination of defInite and indefInite markings to indicate a higher 
degree of specifIcity or individuation in head nouns of relative clauses. 
However, pragmatic and discourse factors seem to mitigate against the 
widespread use of this combination. 
Classical Arabic grammars stipulate that relative clauses that 
modify a definite head noun must be headed by a definite relative

The grammaticality of these sentences rests on an interpretation of 
each head noun as indicating "not a particular individual (animate or 
inanimate), but any individual bearing the name" (Wright 1898ii:318). 
Thus these definite nouns are somehow "less definite" than others, or 
more properly less individuated, and the syntax of the relative clause 
that modifies these nouns reflects that status. 
The mirrored relationship between the dialect examples on one 
hand and Wright's Classical data on the other is worth noting: in the 
dialects, the noun is indefinite and the descriptive clause carries defmite 
marking, whereas in Classical Arabic, the noun carries definite marking 
while the absence of the relative pronoun indicates the non-specific of 
the referent. Both varieties of Arabic use similar strategies in combining 
definite and indefinite markings to weight partly definite, partly specific 
nouns in relative clauses, except that Classical Arabic marks definite 
non-specific while the dialects, in general, mark indefinite-specific.9 
In either case, the specificity of the head noun affects the syntax 
of the entire clause. The use of the definite relative pronoun lillil in 
relativizing an indefinite head noun cannot be predicted or explained 
80f the three examples Wright defines as relative clauses, native speakers of 
Arabic prefer to analyze the second and third as circumstantial clauses. However, 
the first example is difficult to dismiss. 
9There appears to exist a certain parallel between Classical Arabic and 
Moroccan in that Moroccan speakers tend to use the definite article to mark 
non-specific nouns (see 1.6).

by purely fonnal rules, nor can it be judged grammatically "correct" or 
"incorrect;" rather, the combination of definite and indefmite marking 
represents a middle range of a continuum of specifIcity, and demonstrates 
one way in which speakers control the syntactic rules of the language 
to represent the world as they see it. 
3.2 
Non-attributive Relative Clauses 
Two types of non-attributive relative clauses are found among 
the four dialects. The first type, which uses the relative pronoun /illi/ 
without a head noun or referent, is found across all four dialect regions.

The second type of non-attributive relative clause employs non­
attributive, non-specific relative pronouns /ma/ what or /min/ who(m).l0 
IOSome Moroccan speakers use /Iať/ as a non-attributive relative pronoun in 
indirect object position only (see 3.6).

Relative Imal does not appear to be a regular feature of Egyptian or 
Syrian speech, but Syrian speakers do make use of Iminl anyone as a 
non-specific, non-attributive relative pronoun. Cowell notes that this 
use of Iminl is limited to object position within the main sentence 
( 1964:568); his example parallels the following one from my data: 
S4

dialects of indefinite-specific article /Si/, suggesting that, in general, 
these two dialects incorporate into their syntax more structures that 
indicate a range of specificity or individuation in nouns than do Egyptian 
and Kuwaiti. While all four dialects employ various strategies to 
individuate or specify indefmite nouns, the number and kinds of strategies 
available differ. Moroccan in particular tends to mark partly definite, 
partly specific nouns with specifying or defmite articles. 
3.3 
Aleppan Relative Pronoun Iill 
In addition to lilIil, an abbreviated version, Ii II, is found in the 
northern Syrian city of Aleppo. This /ill might at first seem to be a 
variant of lilIi! (Ferguson 1 959 implies so, and lall is attested as a 
variant of lallaͅJiI in Classical Arabic, Wright 1898i:269); however, the 
syntactic structure of the lill relative clause differs from that of lilIi/: 
/ill in fact nominalizes the relative clause so that the relative pronoun 
lies in construct with the head noun. 
The following passage contains two examples of the lill 
construction, which together exhibit two syntactic features which 
distinguish the lill relative from the lilIi! construction: (a) the absence 
of the definite article on the head nouns, Imanti't-I area and /betl house, 
and (b) the pronunciation of the feminine It I in Imanfi't-I.12 These 
features clearly indicate that the head noun and the relative pronoun are 
in a genitive or construct state.

Relative /ill as nominalizer occurs in many other areas of the 
Levant as well, but in a more limited environment. Whereas Aleppan

speaker S5 nominalizes a range of nouns in this way, examples from 
other parts of the Levant mainly contain temporal nouns lsD-cal hour, 
time or Iwa'tl time, as in the following example from a northern Syrian 
speaker:

angel 
In his grammar of Lebanese, Feghali cites a number of similar examples 
of this construction with IsD-Ct ii-I the time that (1928:308). 
These constructions containing IsD-Ct ii-I and Iwa't ii-I differ from 
those in the S5 passage cited above in one important respect: while the 
nouns !betl house and Imani't-I area in the S5 example are specific, 
the nouns Isacal hour, time and Iwa't/ time are non-specific. Evidence 
from all four dialects suggests that the relativization of non-specific 
temporal nouns constitutes a special case of relativization that is the 
topic of the following section. 
3.4 
Relativizing Non-specific Temporal Nouns 
Data from the dialects show a range of constructions in which 
temporal nouns may be relativized. At one end of this range lie normative 
definite relative clauses containing lillil and resumptive pronouns, and 
at the other end are found nominalized clauses that resemble the construct­
like clause headed by lill. This latter use of lillil in temporal clauses 
does not follow normative relative patterns, in that lillil here functions 
as a nominalizer to adverbial phrases whose head noun refers to time, 
such as day, hour, and so forth. These clauses are not true relative 
clauses, since their head nouns are indefinite, and they function in the 
sentence as adverbial clauses. Pragmatically, these clauses often tend 
to be sentence-initial and thus thematic. In addition, the nouns used in 
this construction are low in specificity. 
Moroccan, Syrian, and Kuwaiti speakers all use lillil in temporal 
clauses without resumptive pronouns. These Moroccan and Syrian 

3.4 Relativizing Non-specific Temporal Nouns 
103 
sentences contain examples of temporal /illi/ with an indefinite head 
noun, the /illi/ clause being appended to it in construct state:

In the following Kuwaiti example, /illi/ modifies defmite /ha s-sinin/ 
these years, but no resumptive pronoun occurs within the relative clause: 
K4 
V.,..w. ੬ ''i੭ .:..w..JL. ..,.u' ఀLA . , ! .{j

good that-is you this the-years rei practiced-you like-this saw-you 
what? 
Okay, these years that you've practiced, what have you seen? 
This temporal /illi/ syntactically parallels the Egyptian use of 
/ma/ as a temporal nominalizer, seen in the following: 
E1

and when Manal saw-she-it day that got-I-it, went-crazy-she 
And when Manal saw it the day I got it she went crazy [over it] 
This parallel suggests that /illi/, when in genitive construct with a 
following non-specific temporal noun such as /saca/, acts as a nominalizer 
and not as a relative, which explains the absence of resumptive pronouns 
in these cases. Temporal nouns of low individuation seem to attract 
nominalization rather than relativization. 
It is thus difficult to draw a well-defined boundary separating 
relative clauses from nominalized ones, at least in the case of temporal 

104 
Relative Clauses 
nouns. Rather, the modification of temporal nouns is probably best 
viewed as lying along a continuum of specificity. The lower the 
individuation of the noun, and the less salient the clause as a whole, the 
more likely it is to be nominalized and/or not contain a resumptive 
pronoun. Figure 2 diagrams the range of specificity of temporal nouns 
and the syntactic structures that relativize them.

Syntactically, there appears to be a gradual transition from relative 
clauses to nominalized clauses, particularly with non-specific temporal 
nouns in Moroccan and Syrian. Nouns with low specificity, especially 
those that appear in adverbial clauses, tend to take attributive clauses 
that are restrictive, so identified by the fact that they stand in construct 
with the following relative or nominalizing pronoun. 
3.5 
liIIil as Complementizer 
In addition to its use as a relative pronoun and a temporal 
nominalizer, lillil functions in certain contexts as a kind of conjunction 
or sentence complementizer. The limited yet strikingly parallel contexts 
in which lilli! occurs in Morocco, Egypt, and Syria are worth noting. 
Mitchell and EI-Hassan note that lillil functions as complementizer 
for a "limited group of verbs (or verbal expressions)" in Levantine 
educated spoken Arabic (1994: 1 13). Among their examples (1 14): 
d੫...,.ul Á J·,\'.,:·,I 
nbasatna ktir illi (or 'inn il}na) Uufnak 
[were-happy-we very reI (or comp we) saw-we-you]

[great reI (or comp-you) were-able-you you-finish with-speed] 
It is great that you were able to finish quickly 

3.5 filIi! as Complementizer 
105 
For Egyptian, Badawi and Hinds give one of the meanings of 
lillil as seeing that, since and note that it has functions as a conjunction 
in this sense (1986:33; see also Woidich 1980a). They cite the following 
examples (33):

I elicited a number of similar examples from a Moroccan informant 
native of Meknas, including: 
M3

I was upset [I lost it] that you didn't come 
While Badawi and Hinds define this filii! as seeing that, since,it 
may not be freely used in any context with this meaning. Native 
informants reject sentences like:

What the previously cited examples all have in common-and 
what is missing from the ungrammatical examples-is not syntactic but 
semantic: an emotional reaction, such as happiness, anger, relief, or 
resentment. The "relativized" lillil clause is linked to that emotional 
state in that it contains the underlying reason or cause of that state, 
The lillil clause thus becomes a relative clause modifying an underlying 
or understood reason or cause for the emotional state. 
Speakers from all dialect areas report common usage of the 
construction lil-l:lamdu Ii-I-Iah illil Thank God that, as in the Egyptian 
expression: 
E 
'A ·J.i I P N' il ୩' 
il-Qamdu Ii-I-Iah illi gat 'ala 'add kida 
the-praise to-God reI came-it on extent of-that 
Thank God it wasn't worse 
In this case, it may be the highly individuated status of the noun God 
that attracts the relative pronoun lillil, 
3.6 
Moroccan Word-Order Relatives: Ifa§1 and Interrogatives 
The relative clauses examined so far have all used a case-coding 
relativization strategy in which the syntactic role of the relativized 
noun is marked by a position-marking resumptive pronoun in the relative 
clause (Keenan and Comrie 1 977). However, Moroccan Arabic has a 
second kind of relative clause which operates with a word-order 
relativization strategy, using a different relative pronoun, /faU/, and 
having no resumptive pronoun within the body of the clause,13 This 
kind of clause relativizes oblique objects of low individuation whose 
sentential role is generally locative or temporal. Harrell notes the 
IlIt was noted previously that Moroccan relative clauses with /lIil also do not 
normally code the direct object position with resumptive pronouns, Whether 
this point of similarity between the two constructions bears theoretical 
implications is left to future research.

relative I-aN, used in combination with prepositions If I and (less 
commonly) /hI "in those cases where a human being is not referred to" 
(1962: 164; /ha§1 does not occur in my data).14 In the following three 
examples, Ifa§! relativizes the nouns IW'Jqtl time, 11Ilai night, and 
Imaganatl watches. In the first, /I-w'Jqt/ the time is clearly not highly 
specified or textually prominent. In the second, /I-lila! the night refers 
to a particular night, but the exact identity of that night seems less 
important here than what happened at the time. In the third, /I-maganat/ 
the watches are generic rather than specific.

These examples suggest that relativization with Ifti§1 tends to modify 
nouns low in specification or individuation. 
In the following, Ifti§1 stands as a non-specific, in this case 
non-attributive relative pronoun:

'4Mar·ais cites a construction combining the two pronouns that my Moroccan 
informants found strange: /Ŧl-(lim ŦIli 1M m§it! "['annie ou je suis parti" [lit., 
the year that in which [ left] (1977:205). 

108 
Relative Clauses 
Northern Moroccan speakers I interviewed did not use this relative 
pronoun, but the data I collected contains several examples of a similar 
construction using the interrogative particle /fin/ where: 
MIO

Then again another one comes along drunk and comes and throws 
up on the place where he's sitting, he and his wife and children 
The same construction also occurs in the speech of a woman from the 
Middle Atlas region:

We are going to the place you don't know, you will follow just 
these ashes and chaff until that place where we will alight 
There appears to be some overlap in function between /Ilil as a 
nominalizer for non-specific temporal nouns and Ifasl as a relativizing 
particle for non-specific nouns or nouns of low individuation. As with 
temporal relative/nominalizer /Ilil, relative clauses with lIas/ and /finl 
contain no resumptive pronouns. 
This overlap may reflect regional 
variation, or perhaps constitutes evidence of a shifting paradigm in 
whieh different relativization strategies stand in competition. 
Relativization with lIasl parallels relativization with Illil in 
Moroccan in a lower degree of resumptive marking as compared to 
relative clauses in other dialects. Resumptive pronouns in Moroccan 
/lli/ clauses are only required when the relativized noun is a genitive or 

3.7 Moroccan Relative Pronoun IdJ

the object of a preposition, and the occurrence of a resumptive pronoun 
in direct object position in Moroccan is unusual (Harrell 1962: 164). 
However, the immediately preceding example contains a resumptive 
pronoun in direct object position: /l-bHid Ili rna ta'rfiha§/ the place you 
don't know [it}. The following is more typical; here /l-basfiyyat/ the 
pills is relativized from direct object position with no resumptive pronoun 
in the relative clause itself: 
M9 !J4-=J1 d.:!J I.j ·,.:-,.:b c ȴI .:.'.: b ", .. " d.:!J {I '!ୣ i 
'a sidi Qm_d dik l-basiyyat lli 'itini dik n-nhar! 
o Mr. Ahmed those the-pills reI you-gave-me that the-day! 
Mr. Ahmed, those pills that you gave me the other day! 
A Moroccan informant I questioned about this variation in the occurrence 
of the resumptive pronoun in direct object position offered the 
observation that resumptive pronouns tend to be used in negative 
constructions, such as /l-blad iii rna ta'rf'thM/ the place you don't know 
[it). The use of the resumptive pronoun in such cases may lend a kind 
of emphatic or categorical negation to the clause by specifying the 
negated object: the place you don't know at all. 
3.7 
Moroccan Relative Pronoun /d/ 
A relative particle unrelated to the /iIli/ pronouns exists in the 
mountains of northern Morocco, among speakers known as /̹bala/ 
mountain Arabs. IS 
The following examples are all taken from an 
interview with one speaker, an elderly, uneducated woman:

In the first and second examples, the particle Idhnnul modifies singular, 
highly individuated nouns, while in the third, Idl modifies a less specified 
plural. In the second sentence, Idhnnul in the second clause mirrors 
/lIil in the first, which also regularly occurs in this woman's speech, 
and which is used by the community in which she has lived for years. 
The third example contains the basic relative particle is Id/, which is 
for most Moroccan speakers a variant of the genitive Idyal/. This 
speaker uses Idyal/ overwhelmingly, if not exclusively, in genitive 
constructions. She also uses in the following sentence the interrogative 
particle ff,1 as a non-attributive relative pronoun: 
M9 
1,.0;-,( c.P .ȄI i .l+J Iȅ 
Ura-Iha, 'a l-l)bib, U kayxhooha 
bought-he-for-her the-dear what indic-it-is-necessary-for-her 
He bought/or her, my dear, what she needed 
These data indicate that this dialect also shows a range of relative 
constructions parallel to the urban dialects. However, the speaker I 
recorded has lived for a long time in the town of Larache, and her 
speech is mixed. Relativization strategies in this dialect area warrant 
further investigation. 
3.8 
Summary 
While definite relative pronoun lillil is found in all dialect regions, 
several alternative constructions coexist with it in certain areas. 
Moreover, the use of lillil itself does not quite follow the rules given 
for it in the dialect grammars. 
Relative clauses whose head nouns are morphologically indefinite 
reflect a semantic continuum that ranges from indefinite, non-specific 
to indefinite-specific. An indefinite, non-specific head noun is followed 
by an indefinite relative clause. An indefinite but specific noun, on the 
other hand, may be joined to its attributive clause by the (otherwise 

3.8 Summary 
1 1 1  
definite) particle /illi/. The use of definite relative /ilIi! to partly defme 
or specify indefinite nouns is a regular, if not common, feature of 
spoken Arabic. While the dialects normally follow formal varieties of 
Arabic in distinguishing between definite and indefinite head nouns, 
the definite pronoun /ilIi! can mark a relative clause describing an 
indefinite-specific head noun. 
Data from spoken Arabic point to links between relativization 
and other syntactic constructions. Northern Syrian speakers can relativize 
using /iI! in a clause in which the head noun stands in construct with . 
the following clause, and the mountain Arabs of northern Morocco use 
variants of /d/ in both relatives and genitives. Relativization also overlaps 
with nominalization in temporal clauses, as speakers from Morocco, 
Syria, and Kuwait sometimes use /illi/ to "relativize" temporal nouns 
in constructions where the head noun is marked indefmite, but is modified 
by an /illi/ clauses that stands in construct with it. /ilIi! in these clauses 
parallels the Egyptian nominalizer /mal. 
Moroccan dialects show additional relativization strategies not 
found elsewhere in my data pool. The relative pronoun /fad/ may be 
used to relativize non-human nouns that appear to be of low specification 
and less individuation. At the same time, Moroccan speakers normally 
do not use resumptive pronouns to mark relativized direct objects, 
except in negated clauses. 
In addition to clarifying aspects of the usage of indefinite articles, 
patterns of number agreement, and genitive exponents (Chapters 1 and 
2), the continuum of individuation also helps explain certain patterns of 
relativization in the dialects. A relatively high degree of individuation 
of an indefinite noun, or low individuation of a definite one, may be 
reflected in a mix of definite and indefinite syntactic markers, or the 
use of nominalized as opposed to relativized temporal nouns. Moroccan 
and Syrian speakers both use non-attributive, non-specific relative 
pronouns, Morrocan /mal for inanimates and Syrians /min/ for humans. 
strategies that parallel their use of indefmite-specific articles to indicate 
a middle range on the individuation continuum. Relativization thus 
provides further evidence that, to varying extents, speakers of all dialects 
use of a range of strategies to represent the continuum of individuation 
and specification that exists in the natural world. 

4 DEMONSTRATIVE ARTICLES AND PRONOUNS 
4.0 
Introduction 
This chapter will explore the main syntactic and discourse functions 
of demonstrative articles and pronouns in the four dialects. The primary 
aim will be to look for pragmatic patterns of demonstrative syntax 
across dialectrnot an easy task, given the number of forms and their 
distribution, some marked for gender, some not, some pre-nominal, 
some post-nominal. Nonetheless, evidence suggests that most of these 
dialects share demonstrative patterns and functions. I 
Moroccan, Syrian, and Kuwaiti dialects are characterized by 
considerable flexibility and variety of demonstrative forms and syntax, 
especially in comparison to Egyptian.2 
In the former group, 
demonstratives may precede or follow the noun, whereas in Egyptian, 
the syntax of demonstrative-noun phrases is fixed and homogenous: 
demonstratives must follow the nouns they modify. The range of 
demonstrative patterns in Moroccan, Syrian, and Kuwaiti parallels a 
range of pragmatic functions as well, and these functions will be explored 
in this chapter. 
In Arabic, nominal, pronominal, and adjectival forms normally 
show gender distinction, so it may be surprising to find a lack of 
gender distinction in some of the forms examined here.3 Three of the 
four dialect areas (the exception being Egyptian) have genderless 
unstressed demonstratives. The syntactic and pragmatic functions of 
these pronouns will be explored here. 
(This discussion is limited to the most commonly occurring demonstratives. 
For an exhaustive catalogue of demonstrative forms in spoken Arabic, see 
Fischer (1959). The analysis here relies chiefly on my own data because 
context has been crucial in trying to determine discourse functions of the 
various demonstrative pronouns. 
2Demonstratives in spoken Arabic show greater syntactic flexibility than do 
demonstratives in formal Arabic, which precede the noun except in genitive 
constructions. 
3Rosenhouse attempts to explain away Fischer's citation of ungendered 
demonstrative forms in the Έan(a) (Yemen) dialect (Rosenhouse 1984b:254, 
citing Fischer 1959:71).

4.1 Proximal and Distal Demonstrative Forms 
1 1 3  
The basic function of demonstratives is to manage discourse 
topics.4 Demonstratives identify, recall, highlight, and contrast entities 
that play important roles in discourse. In spoken Arabic, demonstratives 
perform these functions with anaphoric, deictic, topic recall, 
specification, and contrastive reference. All non-deictic demonstratives 
are anaphoric, but a distinction must be made between those pronouns 
that are only anaphoric, and not contrastive, and those that involve at 
least some degree of contrast. 
It is important to distinguish between unstressed and stressed 
demonstrative forms (except in Egyptian, which apparently lacks an 
unstressed form). The unstressed forms serve only to signal anaphoric 
reference, either to an entity that has already been mentioned, or to an 
entity that the speaker presumes is shared with or identifiable by the 
interlocutor, or physically present. The "stressed" forms and functions 
of demonstratives likewise show similar patterns across dialects. It is 
well-known that the proximal and distal forms of demonstratives function 
deictically to refer to near and far objects in both time and space; in 
addition, these two sets of forms can indicate "discourse distance:" 
that is, when used to recall a topic previously mentioned in the discourse, 
the form of the demonstrative helps to signal the degree of proximity in 
a figurative sense, that is, the degree of "retrievability" of the topic.s 
Finally, it is primarily the distal forms that are used to signal contrastive 
reference, perhaps because through distancing two entities from each 
other, their separate identities are more clearly highlighted. 
4.1 
Proximal and Distal Demonstrative Forms 
Grammars of the dialects subdivide demonstrative pronouns into 
two sets, proximal and distal, referring either to temporal or locative 
distance. With the exception of Egyptian, the forms of these pronouns 
are relatively homogenous. Common forms of the proximal set are 
summarized in Table 4-1, and the distal set in Table 4-2. 
4"Discourse topic" is used here in a non-technical sense, to refer to any entity 
that plays an important role in the discourse. 
'Lord and Dahlgren's (1997) study of anaphora in newspaper articles was 
helpful in formulating this analysis.

and Hinds 1986:273).

A cursory glance at Tables 4- 1 and 4-2 reveals similar proximal

of the morpheme /hal from all demonstrative forms is immediately 
apparent.

Unstressed Anaphoric Demonstrative Articles Ihal and Ihadl 
In addition to the fonns given in Tables 4-1 and 4-2, Moroccan, 
Syrian, and Kuwaiti Arabic share a kind of short, ungendered, pre­
nominal, unstressed demonstrative that can only occur prefixed to a 
following noun. I will call these fonns demonstrative articles, adapting 
the tenn from Harrell (1962: 147) with a modified definition. Harrell 
uses the tenn for all fonns that are used with the defmite article and 
precede the noun they modify, gendered and ungendered, short and 
long fonns (1962:147-48, 190). It is necessary to maintain a distinction 
between fonns that only occur prefixed to a following noun, and those 
that can occur independently, a distinction that happens to parallel the 
absence or presence of gender marking as well. Table 4-3 lists the 
fonns of the demonstrative article.

Harrell describes the function of Moroccan /had/ as having 
"generalized demonstrative meaning" with "none of the implications of 
distinguishing between near and far as do the English demonstratives 
this and that" (1962:147, emphasis mine). The lack of ability of /had/ 
to distinguish between objects suggests that its function is anaphoric. 
Similarly, Cowell, analyzing examples of Syrian /hal from his corpus, 
concludes that /hal may be used in either an anaphoric or a "deictic" 
sense6 (1964:556). By the latter he means present in the immediate 
6Cowell uses deictic as "presentational," referring to an entity in the immediate 
speech context, and calls /hal a "demonstrative preftx" (1964:556).

environment, as is clear from the example he gives, in which /ha l-binaye 
l-l)amral that red building stands clearly in view of the interlocutors 
(1964:556): 
S 
LAI..).J '1 1"...J1 LA W. - !ħ.J-A Ĩ ĩ Ī 2.J 
wen fi ma¯(am ƕmnil) hon? --- §ayef ha l-binaye l-l)amra? waraha 
[where there-is restaurant good here? having-seen this the-building 
the-red? '" behind-it] 
Where is there a good restaurant around here? --- Do you see 
that red building? Behind it. 
Cowell's analysis can be simplified by noting that this particular kind 
of deictic function falls within discourse ana ph ora, for entities within 
the physical view of the speakers belong to the current discourse registry 
because they are known and therefore retrievable. 
Both /hal and /hadl share certain grammatical characteristics and 
pragmatic functions. They are numberless and genderless, and do not 
show agreement with the noun they modify. They are sometimes 
called 'unstressed' demonstratives, reflecting the fact that they are never 
used to specify or contrast? Rather, they are only used to mention 
entities whose unique identity is already known to both speaker and 
listener. They belong to a class of demonstratives Croft (1990) calls 
the "anaphoric demonstrative." 
Croft defines the difference between anaphoric demonstratives, 
deictic demonstratives, and definite articles (1990:219):8 
[A]naphoric demonstratives differ from "true" (deictic) 
demonstratives in that they may refer to an object previously 
mentioned in the discourse, but they differ from "true" definite 
articles in that they are not used to refer to uniquely identifiable 
objects not previously referred to (as in I found a jar and unscrewed 
the lid). 
This general definition of anaphoric demonstratives helps us to identify 
the function of /hal and /hadl by contrasting their function to that of the 
7Compare to Wald's discussion of "unstressed that" in English, where "that" 
marks the first mention of an entity that is presumed to be shared knowledge. 
Wald's example: "My sister works in--you know that deer?" (1983: 1 13). 
8The unstressed demonstrative pronoun /hal has been noted by Rosenhouse, 
who claims it is used "more or less as a definite article" -an inexact description 
(1984:251). 

4.2 Unstressed Demonstrative Articles

proximal and distal forms (which also have anaphoric functions, as I 
will show), but it needs to be slightly modified to fit Arabic. 
As Croft notes, in languages that have both anaphoric 
demonstratives and definite articles, the former "competes with" the 
latter (1990:219). However, unlike English that, and like the Arabic 
definite article, Arabic /hal and /hadl may refer to uniquely identifiable 
objects not directly referred to in the discourse, but which exist in the 
permanent registry,9 or can be implied or "retrieved" from the context 
or the registry of topics already established in the current discourse . . 
These anaphoric demonstratives serve to "retrieve" or recall the noun 
from that permanent registry. Another distinction between the definite 
article and the anaphoric demonstratives lies in the specificity of the 
modified noun. The definite article in Arabic can modify generic and 
abstract nouns, whereas the anaphoric demonstratives always refer to 
specific entities, which also have a degree of textual prominence. 
Like definite marking and number agreement, the use of the 
anaphoric demonstrative is subject to a degree of speaker control. The 
choice between the anaphoric demonstrative and the definite article 
depends on the speaker's choice of representation of the textual 
prominence of the noun. Nouns modified by the anaphoric demonstrative 
are more individuated, and play a more important role in the discourse, 
than nouns modified only by the definite article. 
4.2.1 Syntactic Functions of Demonstrative Articles 
Of all demonstrative forms, only the anaphoric demonstrative 
article has syntactic license to modify any definite noun regardless of 
number, gender, or genitive status. 
The following two Moroccan sentences pair /hadl with a masculine 
singular, Il-insanl person, and a human plural, In-nasi people: 
M9 
dJl:!.l JßI àI ..:.WáI .lLA .l JI.l.l1 
d-dar d had l-'insan IIi z-zar dyalk 
the-house gen this he-person reI the neighbor gen-yours 
the house of that person who is your neighbor 
'1'he "permanent registry" refers to unique objects known to everyone, such 
as the sun (see Chafe 1976).

those people of long ago 
Next follow analogous examples from Syrian and Kuwaiti, in which 
/hal modifies masculine, feminine, and plural nouns: 
S2 
J,.UI. . t..:.aJ 1 . . I 
• 
ŦJ 
Ŧ ૕Jŧ

They go in that darkness and that night ... 
K4 NJL.. ...,ul īLA 
ha s-snin illi marasti 
this the-years which practiced-you 
in all these years you've practiced ... 
Harrell and Cowell note that the demonstrative article can precede 
genitive constructions (not pennitted in fonnal Arabic). The following 
Moroccan examples contain /hadl modifying possessed nouns: 
M 
ĬL... ..ILA 
had oaQbi 
[this friend-my] 
thisfriend of mine (Harrell 1962: 191) 
M9 
!,!JI..I ..ILA  
fin had dari? 
where this house-my? 
Where is this house of mine? 
Likewise, in Syrian and Kuwaiti, /hal may precede genitive constructions. 
In this construction, /hal assimilates the defmite article /I-I into a combined 
article that modifies the entire construct, not just the first noun (Cowell 
1964:459): 
S 
'ĭI ..:,ĮLA 
ha l-fhmzan ɝl-)ahwe 
[this the-cup of-the-coffee] 
this cup of coffee 

4.2 Unstressed Demonstrative Articles 
My Kuwaiti data contains a parallel example: 
K3 
ਫ਼, ,j".;..LJLA r ¬ JS 'i[ 
tidtri kil yom ha l-fxug il-Ial}.am 
she-buys every day this the-Iegs-of-meat 
She buys every day these legs of meat 
1 19 
The demonstrative article is thus syntactically distinguished from 
the deictic stressed demonstrative pronouns by virtue of the former's 
ability to modify masculine and feminine, singular and plural nouns, as . 
well as genitive and possessive constructions. These unique synfactic 
features parallel specific pragmatic roles this article plays in discourse. 
4.2.2 Discourse Functions of the Demonstrative Article 
The anaphoric demonstrative article in Syrian, Kuwaiti, and 
Moroccan modifies a unique referent that is already established in the 
conversational registry in one of the following ways: (a) it has been 
previously mentioned in the discourse, directly or indirectly; (b) it is in 
the permanent registry; or (c) it is present in the immediate environment. 
The anaphoric demonstrative normally occurs with the first or second 
mention of a noun. 
Unlike the definite article, the anaphoric 
demonstrative only modifies individuated, textually prominent nouns. 
Unlike the deictic demonstrative, the article may not be used in contrastive 
reference; that is, it can be used to establish coreference just when 
there is only one possible referent. By highlighting the anaphoric 
nature of the reference, /hal and /hadl add cohesion to the discourse in 
several ways. 
Examples from Moroccan, Syrian, and Kuwaiti 
demonstrate the discourse roles these demonstrative articles play. 
In the following Kuwaiti passage, Ifxug il-Ial}.aml legs of meat is 
repeated, the second time with the anaphoric demonstrative, reiterating 
the specific identity of the meat and its importance to the story: 
K3

The interview from which the following question is taken centers 
around the experience of a Kuwaiti professional matchmaker. After a 
discussion of the matchmaker's years of experience, the interviewer 
frames the following question with /ha s-sinin/ these years, referring to 
and summarizing this experience: 
K4 
<.!1 ..s.... uį .İ ı <.!4 ĲJL. OI ĳl.Ji Ĵ1 
!..:.ĵI &-a ௷௸

you this the-years which practiced-you like-this saw-you what 
they-incline to which type of the-girls 
In all these years you've practiced like this, you have noticed 
what? They are inclined toward which kind of girls? 
The previous example contrasts with the following, in which the 
elderly Kuwaiti speaker tells her life story, including all of the places 
she has lived. Among them she mentions this house, using /haga 
I-bet/, because it is only one among a set of possible referents: 
K3 
u.. 2ĶJ t....a..o. !ķ UJJĸ JI IjLA ĹI L:Jj.:a &-a

from moved-in-we now this the-house you-know how-many? five 
and twenty year 
Do you know how long now since we moved into this house? 25 
years 
Similarly, in the next passage, the function of the deictic 
demonstrative /hagi! this in /hagi I-mara/ this woman contrasts with 
that of the anaphoric /hal in /ha s-say/ this thing. The fact that /I-mara/ 
is further modified with a relative clause tells us that she is not uniquely 
identifiable, whereas /ha s-say/ has only one referent, and it is the 
discourse topic here: the protocol of matchmaking.

In the lion-taming Kuwaiti parable from which the next example 
is taken, anaphoric /hal modifies the one and only lion, /ha s-sibi'l that 
lion. Moreover, the syntactic position of that lion indicates that it 
functions as the topic of the sentence, which in tum reflects its importance 
to the narrative:

The next speaker is a Moroccan woman recalling the harsh

indicate both temporal "presence" of this generation and its role as a

Another Syrian passage from the same text contains two 
anaphorically modified nouns whose previous mention is indirect. From 
the phrase Imin if-fSbS1;11 from the early morning, the listener can infer 
the state of darkness and night mentioned directly afterwards. In this 
case, the use of /hal to modify /I-(atmel the darkness and /I-Iell the 
night heightens the semantic impact of these nouns by bringing them 
into the immediate environment: because /hal carries the implication 
of physical presence, the speaker can use it to sumon physical sensations 
associated with the nouns.

In the next Moroccan example, the identity of the house is not in 
question, since the character has only one house. Rather, the meaning 
of the anaphoric article here is subverted and sarcastic: the boy has 
taken the sheep to the wrong house, and the man who sent him uses 
/hadl to let him know that he has confused its unique identity with that 
of another house:

Demonstrative Articles and Prollouns 
Objects in the physical vicinity of the speaker are normally 
identified with the anaphoric demonstrative. The next speaker was 
pointing to a cemetery within sight of the house in which the audience 
was sitting while recounting this passage:

She kept on going and going ... until she got close to where they 
were,following just the marking on the road, {until] she arrived, 
as if she had come up to where those graves are 
Also within the realm of the immediate physical environment is 
the current time frame, regardless of whether the speaker specifies it as 
hour, day, week, month, or year. The demonstrative article is normally 
used in such cases, indicating the immediate temporal environment that 
is the only possible referent: 
MlO ¡La:; ¢ £ I"WI JLA",  ¢ £ ¤"I I"WI t.:.1 
'ana l-'am l-axur mUit §i x;:)msa w had l-'am mUIt Ui tmanya 
I the-year the-other went -I some 5 and this the-year went -I some 8 
Last year I went about 5 {times] and this year I went about 8 
In all of its functions, then, the demonstrative article serves to 
indicate the established identity of a noun, its presence in or importance 
to the speech context itself, whether physical, temporal, or topical. 
One final observation may be made concerning unstressed /hal. 
This pronoun also occurs in Moroccan and Kuwaiti speech as an adverbial 
demonstrative, as these two examples show:

4.3 
Unstressed Distal Demonstratives 
125 
The unstressed anaphoric demonstrative articles are by virtue of 
their form and function proximal forms. However, one particular distal 
demonstrative pronoun, Moroccan /dik/, functions as an unstressed form 
in certain environments. In Moroccan, /dik/ functions as the short form 
of the feminine distal demonstrative, corresponding to masculine /dak/ 
and feminine /dUk/. The following sections propose a distinction between 
distal, gendered /dik/ and unstressed, ungendered /dik/. 
4.3.1 Ungendered Moroccan /dikl and /dakl 
Moroccan speakers from the area surrounding Tangiers use the 
distal form /dik/ in ways analogous to the (proximal) anaphoric /had/. 
That is, when it functions as an anaphoric demonstrative, /dik/ is 
numberless and genderless. The following sentences, taken from 
recorded interviews in the coastal town of Larache, contain nominal 
phrases in which /dik/ modifies masculine nouns. In all of these contexts, 
/dik/ functions anaphorically, modifying a previously mentioned or 
known entity (analogous to unstressed English that). It should also be 
noted that the referent nouns in these contexts are of low individuation, 
such as /Ui/ thing, and /l:tawli/ sheep:

Idik l-blaŻal shows that the demonstrative phrase is non-specific:

You will just follow those ashes and chaff until [you get to] the 
place where we will alight 
The absence of examples in which Idik/ modifies masculine human 
nouns supports the interpretation of its function as modifying nouns of 
low individuation. 
Caubet's data from Fez and the surrounding region contain several 
examples in which masculine Idak/ modifies feminine and plural nouns. 
In the following sentence, Idak/ modifies feminine ISl-bhzal the dialect 
(Caubet 1993ii:6): 
M

In the next example, masculine Idak/ modifies plural /l-iyyam/ the days 
(Caubet 1983:309, translation mine):

Both masculine Idak/ and feminine Idik/ are thus attested as non­
gendered forms, perhaps regional variants of non-stressed, non­
specifying demonstrative forms. 
4.3.2 Non-specific Temporal Demonstrative Idikl 
Moroccan Idlk/ commonly occurs with non-specific temporal 
nouns, such as Isa(al time and Inharl day. to These two Moroccan 
passages both contain Idlk/ modifying a temporal noun, the first 
masculine, loharl day, and the second feminine, Isa(a/ hour.

The fact that these nouns lack specific reference suggests that 
Idlk/ is non-specifying. Rather, Idlk/ here indicates temporal distance. 
Moreover, this non-gendered use of Idik/ is not limited to Moroccan, 
but is also attested in rural Egyptian. Syrian, and Kuwaiti speech. Badawi 
and Hinds report lolk in-naharl the other day from rural Egypt (1986:274):

In all attested cases, the use of /dIk/ as an ungendered form is 
limited to non-specific temporal expressions day and time (fyom/, Inhar/, 
Isa'a/). While these are clearly idiomatic expressions, the degree of 
similarity from Morocco to Kuwait is striking. Data cited in Chapter 3 
shows that non-specific temporal nouns across dialects may be relativized 
in a kind of genitive relative clause not used with other nouns; here is a 
second instance in which the non-specific nature of temporal nouns 
appears to affect their syntactic behavior. 
4.4 
Demonstrative Pronouns in Post-Nominal Position 
While demonstratives obligatorily occur in post-nominal position 
in Egyptian, the other dialects exhibit both pre- and post-nominal 
demonstrative constructions.

4.4 Post-Nominal Demonstratives 
129 
demonstrative forms in Moroccan, Syrian, and Kuwaiti is obligatory 
when the modified noun occurs in genitive constructions. This discussion 
is concerned only with situations in which the post-nominal placement 
is optional. 
Harrell (1962) does not mention post-nominal demonstrative 
constructions in his Moroccan grammar, but several examples occur in 
my data. For Syrian, Ambros remarks that demonstratives "may be 
placed before or after the head noun" (1977:73). Holes noles that 
demonstratives in Gulf Arabic may follow the noun phrase (1990:62). 
In this section, I will examine possible pragmatic motivation for 
placement of the demonstrative pronoun after the noun. 
Post-nominal demonstratives occur in two types of constructions, 
which appear to have distinguishable pragmatic functions. In the first 
type, the noun is followed by a demonstrative pronoun, proximal or 
distal. In the second, the noun is preceded by the anaphoric demonstrative 
article (/had/ or /hal) and followed by a proximal demonstrative, resulting 
in a "double-demonstrative" construction. The nature of the reference 
in both of these constructions appears to be highly individuated, but 
not contrastive, suggesting that the degree of individuation plays a role 
in the choice of word order in demonstrative phrases. 
4.4.1 Post-Nominal Demonstratives 
Both proximal and distal demonstrative forms occur post­
nominally in all dialects. Obligatory and unmarked in Egyptian, this 
construction seems to represent marked usage in Moroccan and Syrian, 
judging by the lower frequency of its occurrence in those dialects. For 
Syrian, Cowell notes that "[l]ess commonly, the demonstrative follows 
a single noun" (1964:558). The examples he gives are without context, 
and I have not yet found examples in my data pool. On the other hand, 
I have found a relatively high frequency of this construction in Kuwaiti 
data, where it may be less marked than in Moroccan and Syrian.12 
The post-nominal position does not seem to be deictic, nor does 
it manage discourse topics, that is, contrast or distinguish among a 
12Por Najdi Arabic, Ingham lists both pre- and post-nominal constructions as 
equally possible (1994:55-56). 

130 
Demonstrative Articles and Pronouns 
number of possible referents. Since post-nominal position is normally 
adjectival, its meaning might be expected to be descriptive rather than 
identificatory. In general, examples I have found in Moroccan and 
Kuwaiti data share two characteristics: the references are clearly 
anaphoric, to previously mentioned nouns, and the discourse contexts . 
in which they occur contain no other topics which might compete for 
attention. The post-nominal demonstrative does not seem to contrast 
the modified noun with another possible referent, but rather to reinvoke 
a previous discourse topic, uniquely identifiable but not current or 
physically present. Its function thus differs slightly from that of the 
demonstrative article /ba(d)/, which establishes coreference with a current 
discourse topic or an entity in the immediate environment. 
The Moroccan speaker of the following statement has been talking 
about her special healing powers. After mentioning a particular man 
whose arthritis she healed, she reinvokes the topic of her healing gifts 
with the reference /s-si hada/ that thing: 
M9 
IJ\.A ੗ I u-k SUV ,-:,ȆI J Jt.-.!.J 
w sJ:tal d I-J:tbab y'arfuni 'Ia s-si hada 
and how-many gen the-friends they-know-me for the-thing this 
And so many friends know me for this thing 
This post-nominal demonstrative construction occurs regularly in 
Kuwaiti speech. In the first passage below, the matchmaker specifies 
the people she takes with her to meet a prospective bride: her partner 
and her customer. The man she mentions, /S-sax_ haga/ that person, 
has already been mentioned, and moreover he is the only plausible 
referent in this case. She uses /baga/ to refer back to the previous 
mention of the man and recall him into the present context.

OK, Umm Ahmed, how can you, let's say, explain to the boy? 
Do you describe the girl to him or do you say to him, Really, this 
girl is pretty and good and so forth 
The post-nominal demonstrative thus functions to alert the listener 
to recall a previously mentioned topic. 
4.4.2 "Double" Demonstrative Constructions 
The second type of post-nominal construction combines the pre­
nominal anaphoric demonstrative article with a post-nominal proximal 
demonstrative pronoun, resulting in a "double" demonstrative. The 
combination of /hal or /had! and the proximal demonstrative gives this 
construction both anaphoric reference and heightened specificity or 
immediacy, similar in force to the English adjective particular. 
It 
seems to have an effect somewhat like a "zoom-in" camera shot in the 
way it focuses attention on the noun it modifies. This construction also 
appears to add cohesion to the discourse, signalling either the closure 
of a particular topic, or a heightened focus on the topic at hand. Cowell, 
analyzing his Syrian data, gives the basic meaning of this construction 
as contrastive, but the examples cited here will show that specificity is 
a more exact description, since any contrast with another possible referent 

1 32 
Demonstrative Articles and Pronouns 
is indirect at best. Cowell too notes the cohesive role played by this 
construction in one of his examples (1964:558). 
The first example is taken from a narrative about the invasion of 
the Moroccan resort town of Larache by rude tourists. After discussing 
the problem at some length, the speaker summarizes his analysis with 
the phrase /had I-qa<;liyya hadi/ this particular problem:

In the following two Syrian examples, /ha l-maJta hay! this 
dressing-woman and /ha -abi hada! this boy signal anaphoric reference 
to the immediate topic. Neither reference is contrastive, rather, the use 
of this construction adds cohesion to the narratives by signalling the 
immediacy of the current discourse topic.

1 34 
Demonstrative Articles and Pronouns 
This double-demonstrative construction focuses attention on a 
discourse topic to heighten its immediacy, or to add cohesion to the 
discourse by further highlighting the relevance of the noun to its context. 
4.5 
Discourse Functions of Distal Demonstratives 
The choice between the proximal and distal forms of the 
demonstrative pronoun in any given context is a relative one involving 
the speaker's perception of distance. Moreover, this distance may be 
physical, temporal, or what will be called here "discourse distance:" 
that is, the relative accessibility of the topic in question within the 
context of the discourse itself. The choice between proximal and distal 
forms often reflects the speaker's judgement about the relative presence 
or distance of the noun in question in the mind of the audience, and the 
relative ease or difficulty of recalling or retrieving it. 
Speakers tend to use proximal demonstrative forms to indicate 
topics close at hand. In the following Kuwaiti passage, the speaker 
uses /hiiga/ twice, in each case to refer to the immediately preceding 
referent because it represents the closer and more easily retrieved topic:

4.5 Discourse Functions of Distal Demonstratives 
135 
Distal demonstrative forms, by contrast, refer to relatively difficult 
to retrieve topics, distant in time, space, or discourse. They often mark 
topic switches in discourse. Distal demonstratives also serve to contrast 
possible referents, by putting distance between them. When contrasting 
between two possible referents, most speakers choose the distal form to 
refer to both. Examples from Moroccan, Syrian, and Kuwaiti provide 
representative contexts in which distal demonstratives fulfill these 
functions. 
In the first Moroccan example, the stressed distal pronoun !hadIk/ 
signals both that {§-Ura/ the knife is not physically present, and that it 
is, in contrast to all other possible knives, the specific one the speaker 
wants:

She said, 0 sir, I have only the knife of the feast, I wouldn't like

The following excerpt from a joke represents an instance in which 
/hadik/ is used to signal to the listener within the joke itself to retrieve 
the topic, /d-dar/ the house from a distance. The house has been a 
previous topic of conversation but is not immediately under discussion; 
it is retrievable but relatively distant.

In the next example, /hadik/ is used three times, each time to 
contrast and put "distance" between the two wives:

The next Moroccan passage contains a number of distal 
demonstratives, and illustrates how the speaker manipulates these forms 
on several different levels. Of particular note here is the shift among 
stressed and unstressed distal forms: the stressed forms recall discourse 
topics to the center of attention, helping to anchor them in the narrative, 
while the unstressed forms are used once the topic has been sufficiently 
established and anchored, usually by the second or third mention of the 
topic.

The final Kuwaiti example shows stressed distal !hagic/ indicating 
both contrast and distance. The story revolves around two characters; 
proximal !hagi/ indicates the central character, the jealous first wife, 
while the distal form refers to the mentally "farther" or lesser topic of 
the second wife. The post-nominal position of !hagi/ indicates that, 
despite the presence of two women, the central character is clear in the 
mind of the speaker, and she expects it to be clear to the listener as 
well. The main character then later uses !hagic/ to refer to her co-wife

Badawi and Hinds cite a number of variant demonstrative fonns in 
Egyptian, and Belnap notes that sociolinguistic interviews he conducted 
in Cairo showed "considerable social evaluation of the distant deixis 
demonstratives" (1991:155). These fonns, and their discourse functions, 
deserve an in-depth study in their own right. 
4.6 
Summary 
Moroccan, Syrian, and Kuwaiti dialects distinguish between 
unstressed, anaphoric demonstratives and deictic demonstratives. These 
dialects share an unstressed anaphoric demonstrative article (Syrian 
and Kuwaiti /hal, Moroccan /had!), a genderless, numberless 
demonstrative whose function is to modify a textually prominent, highly 
individuated noun. Deictic demonstratives consist of proximal and 
distal fonns, and Moroccan speakers have both stressed and unstressed 
distal fonns at their disposal. While proximal fonns tend to be used to 
establish the coreference of entities in discourse, distal fonns are more 
likely to have contrastive reference. 
Unstressed demonstratives that modify non-specified temporal 
nouns do not always agree in gender with the noun they modify. A 
feminine fonn, Idik/, occurs in rural speech across dialects in certain 
fixed expressions involving temporal nouns of low specificity. This 
non-specific feminine marking may be parallel to the feminine singular 
agreement used with collective plurals, both representing a kind of 
neuter gender. 
Proximal and distal demonstrative fonns, too, have discourse 
functions in addition to their deictic meaning. The fonner tend to 
modify discourse topics close at hand, while the latter indicate the 
relative "mental" distance of a topic and signal the need for the listener 
to retrieve it from (relatively) far away. 

140 
Demonstrative Articles and Pronouns 
Speakers from all four regions employ demonstrative constructions 
in which the demonstrative pronoun follows the noun (this position is 
obligatory in Egyptian). Post-nominal demonstratives in the other 
dialects are not contrastive, but rather add physical or temporal 
immediacy to the noun or cohe'3ion to the discourse. 
The absence of an anaphoric demonstrative article in Egyptian 
seems to parallel the absence of an indefinite-specific article (1 .4), and 
perhaps also the higher frequency of neutralized adjectival agreement 
in this dialect (2.3). Perhaps additional synchronic and diachronic 
research will reveal whether or not this pattern has resulted from syntactic 
levelling involving several different types of nominal marking. 

5 CATEGORIZING VERBS 
5.0 
Introduction 
This chapter provides a brief overview of the category "verb" in 
spoken Arabic. The boundaries that separate linguistic categories are 
not absolute, and for some lexical items, membership in one category . 
does not preclude membership in another as well. The category of 
verb itself overlaps with pseudo-verbal elements that may indicate verbal 
meanings without containing all the nonnal morphological traits of 
verbs, such as voice, subject marking, and tense fonns. 
Descriptions of the dialects often cite certain verbs that perfonn 
auxiliary functions or show modified syntactic behavior, such as a 
partial loss of agreement. As Eisele ( 1992) shows, while a fixed category 
of auxiliary verbs in English can be defmed in tenns of syntactic behavior 
patterns,1 no such syntactic tests exist for "auxiliary" in Egyptian Arabic. 
Eisele thus finds no syntactic justification for the category of auxiliary 
in Egyptian Arabic, although he proposes a lexical subclass of auxiliaries 
based on patterns of sentence complementizers, embedding, and subject 
coreference (1992: 160ff.). 
Eisele's analysis will be modified here, 
with particular attention to different types of embedding that occur in 
compound verb phrases. 
The chapter begins with a brief overview of verbs in spoken 
Arabic. It will then propose three categories of verbs that can be 
shown to exhibit special patterns of syntactic behavior and/or function: 
verbs of motion (also called translocative verbs), temporal verbs, and 
pseudo-verbs. Following Eisele, "category" is understood here to be 
"fuzzy," that is, consisting of core and peripheral members, with the 
core members providing the basis for the syntactic and functional 
definition of the category ( 1992: 160). 
'Eisele cites a number of syntactic characteristics that have been shown to 
define English auxiliaries, among them subject-auxiliary inversion in yes-no 
questions (Have you seen?), negative contraction (wouldn't), and "do-support" 
(do cannot negate auxiliaries) (1992: 148). 
141 

142 
Categorizing Verbs 
5.1 
Overview of Verb Forms 
The two basic morphological stems of spoken Arabic are called 
here the pelfective (lfa'al/, also called suffix-stem and perfect tense) 
and the imperfective (lyif'al/, also called prefix-stem and imperfect 
tense). The more commonly used terms for these two forms are 'perfect' 
and 'imperfect,' respectively; however, the term 'perfect' is used here 
and in general to designate a specific formal aspect, to which the Arabic 
/al-ma<;li/ does not correspond. The terms perfective and imperfective 
more clearly describe the aspectual nature of the Arabic morphological 
stems, and the use of these terms in Slavic for a similar aspectual 
distinction makes them preferable to any other. Following Eisele (1988), 
the term tense is defined here to refer only to a morphological verb 
stem; calling the two morphological verb forms "tenses" does not imply 
that their basic meaning is one of time reference. 
For Moroccan, Egyptian, and Syrian dialects, a further distinction 
must be made between marked and unmarked forms of the imperfective. 
This distinction is largely modal, rather than aspectual: one of the 
primary functions of the unmarked imperfective is to indicate subjunctive 
mood, while marked forms of the imperfective represent indicative, 
future, and, in the eastern dialects, progressive and/or intentive moods. 
Kuwaiti, on the other hand, makes no morphosyntactic distinction 
between subjunctive and indicative, and this lack of distinction has 
implications for the modal system of this dialect. These topics will be 
explored in Chapter 8. 
The active (and to a slightly lesser extent, passive) participle 
presents an interesting nexus linking verb and non-verb. Participles in 
spoken Arabic have nominal, adjectival, and verbal meanings and 
functions. When used verbally, participles are tenseless (see Chapter 
7) , but carry aspect (discussed in Chapter 6), and show certain syntactic 
behavior patterns of verbs, such as negation (Chapter 9). 
The perfective stem of the Arabic verb describes a completed 
event, and relative past time reference. Its aspectual meaning has been 
described as "realized" (Mitchell and EI-Hassan 1994) and "complete" 
(Eisele 1990a). The perfective also functions as the prescribed norm in 
formal Arabic for expressing the protasis in most conditional sentences; 

5.2 Auxiliaries and Other Categories 
143 
however, most forms of spoken Arabic allow both the perfective and 
the imperfective stems in conditional sentences. This perceived move 
away from the perfective as the conditional mood has led some to 
speculate that modem spoken Arabic is moving away from an aspectual 
distinction towards a tense-based one (e.g., Holes 1995:177). Chapter 
8 will argue that the variation of tense forms used in conditional sentences 
reflects not temporal location but rather a combination of aspectual and 
modal distinctions. 
The verb system of spoken Arabic also includes lexical items 
that are capable of carrying verbal meaning and sharing some of the 
syntactic functions of verbs. These latter are called here pseudo-verbs, 
after Qafisheh (1975); their main syntactic characteristics are outlined 
in this chapter. 
Finally, the imperative stem of the verb does not differ significantly 
from one variety of Arabic to another, except in its phonological 
realizations. Prohibitives in all four dialects are formed using the 
unmarked imperfective with negating particles /ma! or /lat. 
The 
imperative and prohibitive are not of syntactic contrastive interest and 
thus will not be treated in this study. 
5.2 
Auxiliaries and Other Categories 
The problem with defining auxiliary verbs across languages lies 
partly in the fact that auxiliary is by nature a category that arises out of 
diachronic developments in a particular language's verbal system (Givan 
1979a:221-2). "Auxiliary" in English includes both temporal and modal 
verbs, and their Arabic lexical counterparts have been described as 
auxiliary as well. Thus Harrell calls a number of different Moroccan 
verbs and particles auxiliaries: /bga/ to want, !kan! to be, /x';jff/ must, 
future marker /gadi/, and others ( 1962": 1 78-85). Mitchell and EI-Hassan 
join Harrell in naming these kinds of verbs auxiliaries, classifying them 
as auxiliaries of aspect (according to their definition of aspect, 1994:36). 
However, taken together, the members of these "auxiliary" categories 
have little in common in either syntactic behavior or function. Harrell's 
grouping appears to consist of lexical items that are derived from verbs 
but lack a full conjugation. Any cross-dialect analysis of verbal syntax 

144 
Categorizing Verbs 
must begin with a description of the syntactic functions of different 
types of verbs before any kind of classification can be made. 
The task of describing the verbal syntax of spoken Arabic may 
be streamlined by distinguishing among several types of verbs and 
verb-related particles. A number of verbs having to do with the temporal 
location and/or contour of events, such as onset, cessation, and 
continuation, share certain characteristics of behavior, including frequent 
use in compound verb phrases (phrases consisting of two or more verbs 
that belong to the same clause)? These kinds of verbs may be grouped 
into two "fuzzy" categories: one consisting mostly of translocatives, or 
verbs of motion, whose core members perform special functions in 
narrative contexts, and one consisting of verbs whose primary function 
is to establish time reference, which I will call temporal verbs. In 
addition to their special narrative functions, the syntactic behavior of 
temporal verbs and verbs of motion in compound verb phrases sets 
them apart from other verbs. 
Eisele tests for a lexical class of auxiliary, including /U.n/ to be 
and "aspectualizers" (some of which are designated here as temporal 
verbs), using four subcategorizing and selectional features. He identifies 
four characteristics shared by the core members of his auxiliary class: 
( 1) they may not take a sentence complementizer (linn-/ that); (2) they 
exhibit obligatory subject coreferentiality among members of the verb 
phrase; (3) they admit both modal and non-modal embedding (i.e., 
unmarked and marked imperfectives); and (4) they do not allow 
embedded verbs to carry deictic time reference ( 1 992: 160- 1). This 
discussion will focus on the nature of verbal embedding, thus excluding 
by definition verbs that take sentential complements. Of interest here, 
then, are claims (2), (3), and (4). 
2As Eisele (1992) points out, asyndetic coordination is a regular feature of 
spoken Arabic clauses and sentences, because complementizers can often be 
omitted (unlike formal Arabic, in which a subordinate relationship is normalJy 
signalled by the use of complementizers). However, the relationship of sentential 
complements (clauses that complement verbs such as to thi1lk, to understa1ld, 
to say, and so forth) to main verbs does not concern us here, because the 
sentential complement constitutes a separate, finite clause that can be 
distinguished semanticalJy and that has no syntactic restrictions on the type of 
verb that may occur in it. (The temporal relationship between main clauses 
and sentence complements is treated in 7.1) 

5.2 Auxiliaries and Other Categories 
145 
Eisele cites obligatory subject coreferentiality for /kant to be and 
other "aspectualizers" and modal verbs in Egyptian. However, while it 
is normal for /kfm/ to exhibit coreferentiality with subordinated verbs, 
this feature is not obligatory, as the following example shows. In this 
sentence, the feminine gender of the masculine /kant was-3ms is not 
coreferent with either the feminine subject /sakta 'albiyya/ heart attack 
or the feminine verb /t).atgi-li/fut-3fs-come to me:

l.F" ୈu 
kan Ćatgi-li sakta 'albiyya! 
was-3ms fut-3fs-come-to-me stroke (0 heart 
I was going to have a heart attack! 
Non-coreferentiality with /kant and /!?ar/ to become occurs regularly in 
Syrian Arabic. In the following Syrian sentence, the plural verb /!?aru/ 
they started does not share the singular subject of /yi'zim/ he invites:3 
S5

 IJJL-J 
w !?aJi ya'ni kill w̼id yi'zimna 
and became-they that-is every one he-invite-us 
They started, every person would invite us 
Subject coreferentiality; then, cannot be used as a definitive criterion 
for membership in a cross-dialectal auxiliary class. 
As Eisele's analysis suggests, verbs in spoken Arabic can be 
embedded in two ways: modally and temporally. Modal embedding 
consists of the obligatory use of a subjunctive verb form (in Moroccan, 
Egyptian, and Syrian; Kuwaiti has no distinct form), and is mandatory 
with deontic modals (such as to want, to be necessary, to be able) and 
"causatives" such as to make, to encourage ,  and to advise (Eisele 
1992: 164). Examples of modal emb̽dding from Moroccan, Egyptian, 
and Syrian include:

Categorizing Verbs 
Temporal embedding, on the other hand, is a regular feature of 
time reference in Arabic. This point will be argued in more detail in 
Chapter 7, but briefly, time reference in a main clause, or the head verb 
of a main clause, is normally relative to the moment of speech, and the 
time reference of any subordinate verb or clause is relative to that of 
the main clause, where perfective signals relative past and imperfective, 
relative non-past (see 7.1 for discussion and examples). 
Modal and non-modal embedding may be contrasted in the 
following Egyptian minimal pair cited by Eisele (1992: 1 53). Both 
verbs Irahl he went and lyiruQI he go are temporally embedded by the 
pseudo-verb Ilaziml it is necessary. the imperfective lyitiiQI he go 
signals concurrence with Ilazim/, while the perfective IraQI signals 
relative past, he must have gone, the act of going having taken place 
prior to the time indicated by Ilazim/. However, only the verb lyiruQI 
he go on the right is modally embedded, signalling deontic modality. 
On the left, IraQI he went is not modally embedded, being a finite form 
with epistemic, not deontic meaning. (The clausal boundary may be 
reconstructed semantically: it must be [the case] that he went).

The relationship between two or more verbs in any given sentence 
is thus indicated in part by the type of embedding involved: given a 
compound verb phrase, the second may be modally and temporally 
embedded by the first, or temporally embedded, or, in one exceptional 

5.2 Auxiliaries and Other Categories 
147 
case, not embedded at all. Of the two fuzzy categories examined here, 
temporal verbs embed other verbs temporally but not modally, while 
certain verbs of motion, such as /ral}./ (Moroccan /mJa/) to go, and 
/'am/ (Moroccan /nacJ/, Kuwaiti /gam/) to get up, begin, do not embed 
following verbs either modally or temporally, as the following section 
will show. 
5.2.1 Verbs or Motion 
Certain core members of the category verbs of motion (also called 
translocative verbs) exhibit special syntactic characteristics. Some 
grammars call these verbs auxiliaries, referring perhaps to the absence 
of temporal embedding exhibited by some of these verbs in narrative 
contexts. Harrell lists /mJa/ to go and /Za/ to come as the most common 
"auxiliary verbs of motion" in Moroccan ( 1962: 1 82). Mitchell and 
El-Hassan specify fam/, to get up /ral}./ to go, /iza/ to come, and /rizi(/ 
to return as punctual auxiliaries common in Egypt and the Levant 
( 1994:76-7). 
Across the four dialect regions, the most commonly occurring 
verbs of motion in narratives are verbs meaning to go, to come, to get 
up, and to sit. The actions of getting up and sitting are usually meant 
figuratively, not literally, referring to the onset or finality of an action. 
The following examples represent typical usages of these verbs, highly 
parallel across dialects:

These verbs, M InaQI to get up, and Imsal to go, E IraJ:t1 to go; S 
faml to get up and IraJ:t1 to go; and K IraJ:t1 to go and Iga'adl to sit, all 
occur in compound verb phrases without embedding the following verb 
either temporally or modally. In each case, the two verbs are not 
sequential but simultaneous: that is, the people whose actions are 
described above did not first get up or sit and then perform the other 
actions. It may be argued that the two verbs in these cases actually 
constitute two separate main clauses, and that the conjunction and is 
merely omitted. However, native speakers I consulted find the addition 
of Iwal and to these sentences to be either questionable, unacceptable, 
or different in meaning. 
Another reason for viewing verbs of motion as a distinct group is 
that their participles give a progressive aspectual meaning not associated 
with other participles (see further 6.4). The special functions involving 
the sequencing and aspectual contouring of events in narrative contexts 
are examined in more detail in section 6.5. 
5.2.2 Temporal Verbs 
Temporal verbs include the copula /kanl to be, verbs meaning to 
become, to begin, signalling entry into a state or onset of habitual 
action, verbs meaning to continue, indicating continuation of a habit or 

5.2 Auxiliaries and Other Categories 
149 
state, and the verbal expression to no longer [do], signalling loss of 
state or cessation of habitual activity. Several dialect gramars designate 
some of these verbs as either "auxiliary verbs" or "aspectualizers" 
(Harrell 1962: 179-185; aI-Najjar 1984; Mitchell and EI-Hassan 1994:36). 
Badawi and Hinds call some of the Egyptian variants "preverbs" (see 
e.g. 1986:59,91). None of these terms elucidates the function of these 
verbs, which is not to lend a formal aspectual character to the verb 
phrase, but rather to set the time frame for other actions and states. 
Temporal verbs differ from other verbs in that they embed other yerbs 
temporally but not modally. 
As the archetypal temporal verb, /kant differs from all other 
verbs in spoken Arabic as the only verb that can embed all three verb 
forms, perfective, imperfective, and participle,4 in compound verb 
phrases. The meanings and functions of the verb /kant are almost 
identical across dialects, and it has unique semantic and syntactic status 
as a verb that marks only the time frame of an action relative to the 
moment of speaking, not aspect.s The formation of various tenses with 
/kant embedding perfectives, imperfectives, and participles is detailed 
in Table 5-1. 
Temporal verbs embed other verbs temporally but not modally. 
Unlike other verbs, temporal verbs can embed participles (a non-finite 
verb form). Examples from Moroccan, Egyptian, and Levantine: 
Mi l ɢJl.i ɣ 
bqat gadya 
remained-she going-f 
She kept going 
L 
dL.. ' . _ ,  ఼

remained-we standing-p hour 
E 
We remained standing there for an hour 
,uLJ j..G.l 
fiQil 'a'id 
remained-he sitting 
He kept sitting 
'The acceptability and meaning of participles in temporal phrases is affected 
by the aspectual nature of the verb from which the participle is derived (see 
6.4). 
SIn addition, /kanl functions in conditional clauses as a marker of conditional 
mood (8.7).

no overt subject (1984: 130-1); he gives only participle forms for the future 
perfect. My Kuwaiti corpus contains few examples of compound tenses. 
Moroccan speakers nonnally use marked imperfective with all 
temporal verbs (presumably the reason Harrell designates them as 
auxiliaries, 1962: 179ff). In this example, /tayx;:)mm;:)m/ he thinks

In Syrian. temporal verbs embed either a marked or an unmarked 
imperfective. In the first of the following two examples. the verb 
embedded by IWarl to become is unmarked. while in the second the 
embedded verb is marked with the progressive particle Imma/ (a variant 
of learn/):

Pseudo-Verbs 
A number of expressions belonging to the verb phrase but are 
not fully verbal themselves have been labelled auxiliary verbs. modals, 
preverbal elements (Eisele 1988. Ingham 1994). and pseudo-verbs 
(Qafisheh 1 975). I adopt here the term pseudo-verb. since it best 
describes the partially verbal syntactic nature of these expressions. 

152 
Categorizing Verbs 
Pseudo-verbs function as main verbs in a sentence: they are negated as 
verbs, and many can modally embed other verbs. Predictably, the 
membership of many lexical items in the pseudo-verbs class is not 
stable, for several reasons. Some lexical items have both verbal and 
non-verbal meanings. In addition, some verbs and verb-like elements 
are undergoing processes of evolution by which they are gaining or 
losing verbal characteristics. These changes are neither unidirectional 
nor recent; nor are they limited to urban, high-contact areas. 
Most if not all varieties of spoken Arabic contain lexical items 
that do not belong to the morphological category of verb but do occupy 
a slot within the verb phrase and often share certain features of verbal 
syntax. In the following sentences, prepositions are used to establish 
existence or possession. The prepositions /fit there is and /'and/ (/'indl) 
at take the sentence-initial verb position, and are negated with standard 
verbal negation, in Egyptian /ma - 'S/, Syrian and Kuwaiti /ma/. 6

6Word order typology is discussed in Chapter 10, where it is contended that 
VSO is a normal sentence typology for spoken Arabic. Chapter 9 describes 
the system of negation in spoken Arabic and the distinction between verbal 
and predicated negation forms. 

5.3 Pseudo-Verbs 
153 
Membership in the pseudo-verb category is not lexically but 
semantically determined, and lexical items whose semantic domains 
incorporate a range of verbal and non-verbal meaning do not always 
function as pseudo-verbs. For example, the Syrian preposition Pil-/ to 
have or belong(ing) to may be verbal or locative. Both of the following 
sentences contain /'ilak/ belonging to you, but the underlying structures 
of the sentences differ. The flrst example shows a more verbal structure 
and meaning, marked by word order and the verbal negative particle 
/ma/, while in the second filak/ is clearly predicated, and negated with 
the predicating negative particle /mfJ./.

The "fuzzy category" of pseudo-verbs is useful in describing the 
syntactic behavior of certain lexical items in certain semantic and 
syntactic contexts. The constellation of features shared by pseudo-verbs 
include verbal negation, the ability to subordinate, semantically and (in 
most cases) syntactically, and the ability to take pronoun subjects and 
logical objects. A number of lexical items can be seen to behave 
sometimes, but not always, as pseudo-verbs. 
5.3.1 Characteristics of Pseudo-Verbs 
In general, most pseudo-verbs consist of either prepositions that 
give locative or possessive meaning, or of nominally derived forms 
that give modal meaning (particularly obligatory mood). Pseudo-verbs 
are characterized by one or more semantic or syntactic features. A 
pseudo-verb can be a nominal or prepositional phrase that is used 
semantically to convey a verbal meaning, often but not necessarily 
possessive or existential in nature. This type of pseudo-verb may take 
its logical subject in the form of a pronoun object. Modal pseudo-verbs 

154 
Categorizing Verbs 
that take a verbal complement normally subordinate the verb 
syntactically, requiring the verb to be subjunctive. Pseudo-verbs are 
usually negated with verbal negation (see 9.3). Finally, a few pseudo­
verbs appear to have developed in an opposite direction: rather than 
arising out of non-verbal elements that took on verbal function and 
(subsequently) verbal structure, these pseudo-verbs appear to be the 
result of partial loss of verbal status. 
The semantic feature is an essential part of the definition, because, 
as seen above, many lexical items that often function as pseudo-verbs 
have other, non-verbal roles as well. On the other hand, the expression 
of logical subject as object is not limited to pseudo-verbs, since some 
verbs, such as I'azabl to please, have the same construction. 
The best syntactic test for determining whether a particular word 
may belong to this category is negation: many lexical items that function 
as pseudo-verbs are negated in the same way as verbs. In the following 
examples from Morocco and Egypt, possessive pseudo-verbs I'[a]ndl 
and lIiI take the verbal negation pattern of Ima - Į/:

E 
௏J..:J La 
rna liĮ nifs

The main exception to this rule of thumb is found in Cairo,' 
where pseudo-verbs derived from participles are normally negated with 
the predicate negating particle ImiĮ1 rather than the verbal negative 
particle Ima - ĮI (negating particles are discussed in Chapter 9):

7Behnstedt and Woidich find negation with /ma - §/ to be common in many 
parts of Egypt (1985). 

5.3 Pseudo-Verbs 
155 
The characteristics that make up the loose category of pseudo-verbs 
are thus better envisioned as syntactic norms rather than hard and fast 
rules, since particular lexical items may be "more" or "less" pseudo­
verbal in nature. In Syrian Arabic, /baed/yet functions as a pseudo-verb 
meaning to still [be} :8 
S3 
V4 DW 
ba(dni b-SI-bet 
still-me in-the-house 
I'm still at home 
The verbal nature of this expression appears in the use of the direct 
object pronoun /ni/ me as an object of /ba(d/. However, /ba(d/ may be 
"less verbal" than many other pseudo-verbs in that it cannot be negated; 
Syrian speakers reject sentences such as */ma ba(dni bi-l-bet! I am not 
still at home. 
A number of pseudo-verbs expressing necessity or obligation (E, 
S, K /lazim/, M /xSff/ must), ability (E, S /ft/ able), desire (S /bidd/, K 
/wudd/, E fayiz! want, E /nifs/ appetite), and so forth, behave syntactically 
like main verbs in that they subordinate their verbal complement. This 
subordination can be demonstrated in Moroccan, Egyptian, and Syrian, 
because subordinate verbs in these cases must be unmarked imperfective. 
(Kuwaiti, on the other hand, does not morphosyntactically mark 
subordination.) The following contain subordinating pseudo-verbs: 
M3 
l.!.a.J1 Iਬ ୅

entered-it to-until at the-drum neg knowing-Chow] it-cross 
[The insect) went in as far as the eardrum, not being able to 
cross 
7he pseudo-verb /baed/ [to be] still [doing] is also common in the Najd 
(Ingham 1994:107-8), but does not occur in my Kuwaiti data. This meaning 
is verbal in most varieties of Arabic (compare to formal Arabic /ma zala/ to 
remain, to not cease).

Some Syrian prepositional pseudo-verbs, such as /'and/ at 
(possession) and /fi-/ can, be able, have adopted accusative marking 
for their objects (which represent in some cases the logical subject). In 
the following, /fi-/ takes the accusative first-person singular pronoun 
obejct /ni/ (first-person singular is the only pronoun whose accusative 
form, /ni/, differs from its genitive, Ii/).

the accusative marker / ya-/:

In addition to the more common pseudo-verbs cited above, these 
four dialects appear to share a pseudo-verb /'umr-/ (Moroccan 
/'am(m);)r-/) meaning never. The following constructions demonstrate 
the optional use of this particle as a pseudo-verb (it may also be used 
adverbially):

157 
Most interesting about this pseudo-verb in particular is its semantic 
resemblance to temporal verbs, which delineate the time frame of an 
action. To never [do} bears semantic affinity with to no longer [do}, 
and this affinity may have helped to attract verbal syntactic behavior to 
the noun /'umr/. 
5.3.2 Pronouns as Copulas 
Subject pronouns that "separate" subjects and predicates in 
copulative sentences optionally occur in all dialects. Khan explains the 
tendency for this kind of topic-comment construction to occur in certain 
environments in Semitic by noting that these pronouns, which he calls 
agreement pronouns, appear in equational sentences whose predicate is 
highly individuated (1988:50). Cowell identifies this structure as marked, 
calling it "extraposition;" among the examples he cites is the following, 
containing subject pronoun /hiyye/ it as copula (1964:434): 
S 
+",,'il " .IJక.J ਪ * rJll 
ahamm Ui bi-khll doktOIii hiyye l-'htril}a 
[most-important thing in-each doctorate it the-dissertation] 
The most important thing in every doctorate is the dissertation 
Of interest here is that this "agreement pronoun" has become in some 
dialects a full-fledged, pseudo-verb copula.9 
This kind of copula 
development is noted as a regular cross-linguistic phenomenon by Li 
and Thompson (1977). 
Moroccan speakers can use masculine and feminine third person 
pronouns in equational sentences whose subject is first person. This

feminine /hiyya/, and appears only with highly individuated predicates.

Eid cites similar Egyptian examples that show third person 
masculine pronoun /huwwa/ as a non-gendered copula ( 1992: 122): 
E 
YI ,.,.. YI 
.:.:al ,.,.. .:.:al

inti huwwa inti

ana huwwa il-mudir 
I am the director (m) 
I have not found examples of this construction in Kuwaiti, and 
attempts to elicit sentences similar to the examples above from Lebanese 
and Syrian speakers have proven unsuccessful. Evidence suggests, 
then, that the pronoun has developed into a copula only in the western 
dialect regions. However, all four dialects make use of a negative 
copula, consisting of a verbally negated pronoun; this copula will be 
surveyed in section 9.3.5. 
5.3.3 Pseudo-Verbs in Rural Northwestern Syria 
It was noted above that pseudo-verbs normally subordinate a 
verbal complement so that the subordinate verb must be non-finite. 
However, evidence from a female 'Alawite speaker from a northwestern 
village near Lattakia shows the use of certain pseudo-verbs meaning be 
able to and have with finite verbal complements, including perfective 
verbs. The following two examples show pseudo-verbs /fit be possible 
for and /'il-/ belonging to playing an ambiguous role in the grammar of 
the verb phrase. In the first, /fi-/ be possible for is negated as a verb 
with /ma/, but followed by the perfective /rl).t/ I went, rather than the 
expected subjunctive /riil)./ I go. Similarly, in the second example, /'ili/ 

5.3 Pseudo-Verbs 
159 
I had occupies a verbal position following Ima 'ad! no longer (lit., it 
did not come back, yet the semantically subordinate verb lr.it).';Jt/ I went 
is also perfective. In the third sentence, lfi-I carries the future particle 
Irat).I normally restricted to verbs:

[The program] "Rimi" came on, I no longer had the heart to go 
ȡ C:J L. 
rna rat). fini 
neg fut possible for-me 
I won't be able to 
These constructions do not occur in the other varieties of spoken 
Arabic examined here. On the one hand, lfi-I able is more verbal than 
its counterpart in other dialects, taking verbal future marking, and on 
the other hand, it is less verbal, in that it does not subordinate a verbal 
complement. Does this ambiguity mean that lfil in this dialect is less 
developed, or developing in a different fashion, than it is in urban 
dialects of the region? Or do these examples result from dialect­
switching, since the speaker in question is also a student at the University 
of Damascus, and her speech shows adaptation to the norms of this 
prestige dialect in a number of ways (for example. she normally changes 
her native Iql for the more prestigious urban />/)? More research into 
these kinds of construction is needed. 
5.3.4 Loss of Verbal Status 
The process by which certain non-verbal lexical items acquire 
features of verbal behavior is mirrored by a process of verbs losing 
verbal characteristics. This process is evident in the dialects as well. 
Of the impersonal Moroccan verb Ixrss1 it is necessary. Harrell 
remarks that the marked imperfective /kayxrss1 is "sometimes" used.

indic-it-is-necessary-for-him it-be the-beach gen-his all-of-it 
He wants the beach to be all his 
Some verbs have undergone partial agreement loss in another 
way: certain functions of the verb lose markings. This phenomenon is 
evident in Kuwaiti lean/, derived from /kanl to be. The latter retains 
full conjugation as a verb, but appears in the frozen form leanl without 
subject marking when it marks mood (see Chapter 8).

Other verbs that have lost or are in the process of losing verbal 
features include Moroccan I'adl then, again and Syrian Ima 'adl no 
longer. The particle I'adl, originally a verb, to return, has become in 
many areas a frozen particle whose discourse function lies in signaling 
a subsequent event in a logical chronology. Examples include:

5.3 Pseudo-Verbs 
161 
Nor is this process limited to the urban dialects: the Gulf and 
Najdi dialects show traces of this process too. The presence of such 
particles in Najdi indicates that this kind of development is neither new 
nor tied to the spread of Arabic outside the Peninsula. In Najdi, the 
frozen particle I'adl means still, anymore, the antonym of Ima 'adl no 
longer, no more, as Ingham's examples show (1994: 107-8): 
N

• 
N 
uS1 t .,I .It&. L. ":"..)-'4 IXI 
axiran firt rna 'ad algah 'a t-tilifon 
Finally I became unable to get him on the telephone 
This process is more or less complete in some cases: 
what 
presumably began as time frame and narrative contour verbs, Moroccan 
I'ad! then, again, Egyptian ltannl kept on, then, and Kuwaiti leanl would 
are now frozen particles (see 6.5.2, 8.5). 
In other cases, this process seems still to be underway. Syrian 
Ima 'ad! no longer shows subject agreement much of the time, especially 
with first and second person subjects, but is beginning to lose agreement 
in some cases, especially with third-person subjects. In the following, 
Ima 'adl lacks number agreement with the plural subject they that is 
marked on the subordinated verbs Iyisma'ul they listen to and IY'J§'alu/ 
they turn on: 
S2 
U..HಂI Iಃ .It&. L. 'Y.Y' IZ .It&. L.

no longer-ms they-listen music, no longer-ms they-turn-on the­
television 
They no longer listen to music, they no longer turn on the television 
Clearly, processes of grammaticization, Bybee, Perkins, and 
Pagliuca's (1994) designation for the diachronic development of 
grammatical morphemes, show a number of parallels across dialect 
regions. A comparative study of the evolution of verbal morphemes 
across all dialect regions, especially in light of grammaticization theory, 
would make an important contribution to the field. 

162

5.4 
The Participle 
The Arabic participle presents several problems to the would-be 
analyst.1O The classification and description of the active and passive 
participles in formal Arabic describe a form more nominal than verbal, 
reflecting the more common nominal and adjectival usages of the 
participle in formal Arabic. In spoken Arabic, however, the participle 
maintains a primarily verbal function (see further 6.4 and 7.3). Participles 
can be used to refer to actions and events that have taken place, are 
taking place, or will take place in the future. At times the participle 
seems to describe a completed event, at others a state, and at other 
times a continuous activity. The reason for this ambiguity lies in part 
in the attempt to include time reference in the definition of the participle, 
and in part in the conflation of formal aspect with lexical aspect, problems 
to which I will return in Chapters 6 and 7. The participle is included in 
this survey of categories that are verbal in nature, without being full­
fledged verbs. 
The verbal features of the participle have been well documented 
by Mitchell ( 1952), Harrell (1962), Cowell (1964), Wild ( 1964), and 
Eisele ( 1988). The most obvious characteristic that participles share 
with verbs is that active participles can take both direct and indirect 
objects, as the following examples show: 
MI l '4-:0.>-' / I ³J 
dik lli mrćbbyah 
this which having-raised-him 
The one who had raised him 
El 
IJJ8I .9: ;

just having-brought-f-it today 
/('ve) just got(ten) it today 
'OParticiple here refers to the active and passive forms /ism fii'il/ and /ism 
maf'iil/ and their derived forms. I will avoid here the question of the relationship 
of the /fa'ian/ form to /ffi'il/ and its derivations. It appears that /fa'ian/ is most 
productive in Syrian (see Grotzfeld 1965:30); my data contain very few examples 
of it, and these are purely stative, e.g. /kant nafsiytha ta'bana/ her emotional 
state was tired (Kuwaiti). This form is of limited productivity in the western 
dialects, and does not occur at all in my Moroccan data.

163 
The examples cited above raise a point of comparative interest 
involving the morphosyntactic behavior of feminine participles. Within 
the four dialect groups treated here, an east-west isogloss exists for the 
pronunciation of the feminine suffix /-a[tl/ when direct and indirect 
pronoun objects are suffixed to it (as in S5 and K2 above). In the 
western dialects, the /-t/ is not pronounced, and the /-a/ is lengthened, 
whereas in Syrian and Kuwaiti the /-t/ is pronounced, as if the participle 
were a noun in construct. It is not an absolute east-west isogloss, since 
Mitchell's (1952) description of Liby̾ shows the /-t/ pronounced as in 
the eastern dialects. The pronunciation of /-t/ may be historically related 
to the /tanwln/ suffix /-in! on participles in Peninsular bedouin dialects 
(see Ingham 1994: 49); in any case, it deserves further study. 
Participles carry gender inflection for subject, but not person .. 
An exception to this rule is found in the Syrian area, where active 
participles whose subject is second-person feminine have developed an 
ending that looks very much like a perfective verbal suffIx. The following 
example shows a feminine singular participle, źayfa/ having seen, with 
the genitive pronunciation /-t/, and the addition of the feminine second­
person verbal suffix /-i/: 
So 
1j ..l.A.:l.\I ொw. 
§aySftI la-'aJ:tmad? 
having-seen-you-f-him obj-Ahmed? 
Have you (f) seen Ahmed? 
The motivation for this development seems to lie in the quasi-verbal 
nature of the participle, and in particular an aspectual association between 
it and the perfective, an association discussed further in Chapter 6. 

164 
Categorizing Verbs 
Variations in the negation patterns of participles show that the 
participle sometimes functions as a verb, and at other times takes its 
syntactic position within the predicate (see Chapter 9). Chapter 7 will 
show that the participle may be used in past, present, and future time 
frames, a fact which prevents its formal association with any particular 
tense or time reference. 
5.5 
Summary 
The category of verbs in spoken Arabic contains both core and 
peripheral members. The latter group includes members called here 
pseudo-verbs, defined not lexically but syntactically, as non-verbal 
expressions that show certain aspects of verbal behavior, such as negation 
patterns and syntactic objects, which often represent logical subjects. 
Two other subcategories of verbs were also proposed: verbs of motion 
and temporal verbs. Verbs of motion exhibit unique syntactic behavior 
in their occurrence in non-embedding compound verb phrases. While 
other types of verbs embed temporally and modally, the core group of 
motion verbs do neither, and some verbs of motion have special narrative 
functions (see Chapter 7). Temporal verbs, which function to delineate 
the time frame of an event, also consist of core and peripheral members. 
Temporal verbs embed other verbs temporally but not modally. The 
quintessential temporal verb, !kan/ to be, embeds a full range of perfective, 
imperfective, and participle forms, something no other Arabic verb can 
do. Other members of this class may embed participles; the extent to 
which they embed indicative imperfectives varies from dialect to dialect, 
being most common in Morocco and least common in Egypt. (Kuwaiti 
has no distinct indicative forms.) Chapter 7 contains further discussion 
on the syntactic behavior of temporal verbs. 

6 ASPECT 
6.0 
Introduction 
Comrie defines aspect as consisting of "different ways of viewing 
the internal temporal constituency of a situation" (1976:3). For example, 
events and actions may be represented as punctual, i.e., having no 
internal dimension, or as durative, i.e., action-as-process.1 Comrie's 
(1976) discussion includes three main cross-linguistic aspectual 
distinctions: perfective, imperfective, and perfect. I will argue here 
that these three cross-linguistic categories are realized in Arabic as the 
morphological forms of the verb, perfective, imperfective and participle.2 
The primary aim of this chapter is to provide a basic description of the 
aspectual meanings of these Arabic forms with particular attention to 
narrative contexts. 
An important step in describing the nature of verbal aspect in 
Arabic has been Eisele's recognition of the distinction between two 
different types of aspect, 'formal' and 'lexical' ( 1990a:190; cf. Comrie 
1976:6, n. 4). Formal aspect refers to the way in which the action in 
question is represented: as a complete, punctual event, as a duration or 
process, or as a resultant state. Lexical aspect (also called aktionsart, 
type of action), on the other hand, refers to a semantic feature inherent 
'Mitchell and El-Hassan define aspect as "first and foremost a matter of 
duration, of progress from one location in time or space to another" (1994:74). 
Their study of aspect in the educated spoken Arabic of Egypt and the Levant 
concerns itself with interrelationships among aspect, tense, and modality, and 
explores a number of fine distinctions in meaning. This discussion treats 
these three verbal categories as distinct from one another. 
2Arabic has both active and passive participle forms (/ism fii'ill and lism 
maf'(U!), and both forms can give verbal, nominal, and adjectival meanings. 
The term participle as used throughout this chapter refers to participles with 
verbal meaning. Active participles occur more commonly than passive ones, 
and most of the examples in this chapter happen to he active, but passive 
participles can also carry perfect aspect, as the passive participle Imal:ttiltl 
having been put demonstrates here:

Aspect 
in an individual verb, such as punctuality or duration, telic or atelic 
meaning, or stative or dynamic (Comrie 1976). Lexical aspect is not 
itself a syntactic category, but it does have implications for syntax in 
that interpretations of contextualized meanings of the imperfective and 
the participle depend in part on the lexical nature of the verb. 
6.1 
Lexical Aspect 
A number of studies have investigated lexical aspect in various 
registers of Arabic, and examined the ways in which different 
interpretations of surface meaning are explained or predicted by the 
semantic nature of the individual verb. McCarus (1976, Syrian), el-Tonsi 
(1982, Egyptian), Eisele (1990b, Egyptian), Ingham (1994, Najdi) and 
aI-Najjar ( 1984, Kuwaiti) have proposed classifications of verbs 
according to their lexical aspect. 
These classifications range in 
complexity from Ingham's bifurcation of aktionsart into state/motion 
and action ( 1994:89-90), to McCarus' rather elaborate system based on 
analyses of aspect in English. 
Harrell classifies Moroccan verbs in four categories: durative, 
punctual, state/motion, and a fourth unnamed category whose description 
matches that of inceptive verbs (1962: 176-177) . These verbs refer 
either to an immediate activity or a necessary resultant of that 
activity, e.g. rkeb 'to mount' or 'to ride' (mounting being a necessary 
prerequisite to riding), Ibes 'to put on' (clothing) or 'to wear' 
(putting something on being a necessary prerequisite to wearing 
it (1962: 177). 
McCarus (1976) compares lexical aspect in formal Arabic, Syrian, 
and English, and proposes a semantic categorization of lexical aspect 
based on the meanings of the participle and the imperfective. He 
distinguishes among a number of aktionsart categories, including state, 
movement, accomplishment, achievement, developmental, and 
inceptive. 
Eisele ( 1990b) demonstrates the ways in which lexical aspect 
interacts with formal aspect in Cairene Arabic, affecting the semantic 
interpretation of a given verb in its active participle and marked 
imperfective forms. 

6.1 Lexical Aspect 
167 
AI-Najjar's study of aspect in Kuwaiti conflates lexical and formal 
aspect. 
His primary aim is to describe the roles and meanings of 
certain verbs he calls "aspectual markers" (1984: 1 1). Ingham's approach 
to aspect in Najdi more closely conforms to the goal here, which is a 
simplified description of verbal behavior. Ingham describes Najdi as 
"exhibit[ing] an Aktionsart category dividing verbs into two classes (1) 
Action and (2) State/Motion verbs" (1994:87). He recognizes that 
verbs of all types can have mUltiple interpretations, telic and atelic, 
inceptive and non-inceptive, and that this multivalence of verbs makes 
their categorization problematic (1994:91).3 
Most of these studies classify the possible lexical aspect or 
aktionsart readings given by the various verb stems. Depending on 
whether the verb is stative, motion, inceptive, or act, the marked 
imperfective allows habitual, progressive, and/or gnomic meanings, 
and the participle allows perfect, "present state" (called here resultant 
state), present progressive, or simple future interpretations. 
A 
comparative analysis of Egyptian and Syrian studies, combined with 
extrapolations from Moroccan and K̿waiti data, reveals similar patterns 
of lexical aspect form and meaning throughout all four dialect regions. 
Table 6- 1 summarizes the results of this analysis in chart form.4 
Even in the brief summary presented in Table 6-1 ,  the semantic 
classification of verbs looks rather complex, and there remains a good 
deal of overlap among the various categories The main shortcoming of 
this kind of approach lies in the attempt to classify verbs lexically in 
these categories. Many Arabic verbs contain within their semantic 
fields more than one lexical aspect, and may thus belong to more than 
one semantic category. 
Ingham's distinction between telic and atelic verbs̀r, more 
precisely, verb meanings-1lroves central to understanding verbal 
semantics. Ingham defines telic verbs as verbs whose action "leads up 
to a definite conclusion, as in to build a house or to write a letter" 
3Ingham's discussion of aspect in Najdi, and his insights on the telic/atelic 
distinction were crucial in the formulation of the analysis presented here (see 
also Comrie 1976:44-48). 
4Sample verbs are given in English due to the practical difficulty of including 
transcriptions from four different dialects. 

168 
Aspect 
( 1994:89). Atelic verbs, by contrast, describe an action with no definite 
conclusion, such as to work or to read. A telic/atelic classification of 
verb meanings simplifies the classification of lexical aspect, particularly 
of the participle.

Eisele reports two different aspectual readings for the participle 
/m'aggara/ having rented in the following sentence (l990b:21O): 

6.1 Lexical Aspect 
E 
.r-'" ,":-,J..I ! :if ., . •  ";"t. ] ^.a 
huda lissa m'aggara Ja»a fi darb il-'al:tmar 
[Huda just/still having-rented apartment in Darb al-Ahmar] 
Huda has just rented an apartment in Darb al-Ahmar or 
Huda is still renting an apartment in Darb al-Ahmar 
169 
The two readings of this sentence reflect two different lexical aspects 
of the verb /'aggar/ to rent: telic to make a rental agreement, and atelic 
to be or begin renting (a place). The combination of telic with the 
action nature of the verb results in a perfect reading of the participle in 
the former, and the atelic, stative character of the verb in the second 
gives a progressive reading. Mitchell gives a similar example containing 
the participle /m'addi/ having crossed, crossing (1978:249): 
E 
tJl..!JI ^_ ؐ 
Juftu mi'addi iJ-Uri' 
[saw-I-him having-crossed the-street] 
I saw him crossing the street or I saw he had crossed the street 
The motion verb /'adda/ to cross may· be atelic, signalling the entry into 
the state of motion but not its completion, or it may signify the act of 
crossing the street in its entirety, a telic act. These mUltiple readings 
suggest that it may not be desirable-<>r possible-to assign a given 
lexical item to just one aktionsart class. 
The semantic analysis of verbs can be simplified by allowing 
verbs membership in more than one category, depending on context. 
Many verbs in Arabic have both telic and atelic meanings that are 
realized by both form and context, such that /naml can mean either to 
fall asleep or to sleep, /qa'ad/ to sit down or to be sitting, /daras/ to 
study or to study something, /'irif/ to know or to find out, depending on 
the context and the morphological form used. The verb /gakar/ to 
study, review [a lesson] can be either telic or atelic, and hence punctual 
or durative, in some dialects. Ingham admits only an ateIic meaning 
for Najdi, and thus cannot give a reading for the active participle 
(1994:91). In Egyptian, however, telic use of this verb is common, and 
gives rise to a perfect interpretation of the participle: /'ana mizakir 
id-dars/ I have studied the lesson. 

170 
Aspect 
A general reluctance to designate a reading of resultant state for 
verbs of motion seems to be based mainly on the usage of the verb 
/ra'r)./ to go, which cannot give a resultant meaning in some dialects. 
However, other verbs of motion commonly give resultant state meanings, 
among them /za/ to come, arrive and /misi/ to leave: 
S 
*4- SZ 
E 
*L. ; .J-A 
ba'dni jaye 
huwwa lissa masi 
just-me having-arrived 
he just having-gone 
I have just arrived 
He has just left 
The verb /l:labb/ has both a stative, atelic meaning, to love, and 
an inceptive, telic meaning, to fall in love with. The speaker's choice 
to use the participle /'r).abbe/ having fallen in love with rather than the 
imperfective /bit'r).ibb/ she loves in the following sentence stresses the 
telic meaning, that she has fallen in love or had a love affair. The telic 
meaning emphasizes the completion of the act, and implies that the girl 
in question has stepped over the line of acceptable social behavior: 
S2 
u.. ਦ .:..:,IS <,:'u u. F .:..:,IS <,:'LA oŵ 1A .:..:,IS <,:'LA 
hayy kanit 'r).abbe flan hayy kanit tiÇla' ma'u hayy ka.nit titmassa 
ma'u 
this was-she having-fallen-in-Iove-with so-and-so this was-she 
she-go-out with-him this was-she she-go-walking with-him 
This [girl] was in love with so-and so, she would go out with 
him, she would go out walking with him 
These semantic categories, then, can best be viewed as categories 
of verb meanings, and not categories of verbs. The complexities of 
lexical aspect analysis can be reduced by classifying meanings rather 
than verbs. Since verbs can have both telic and atelic, or inceptive and 
non-inceptive meanings, depending on context and lexical item; these 
features provide the key to a simplified classification. The analysis 
proposed here will focus on the participle because it represents the 
most problematic of all verb stems. 
Both the completion of an action and entry into a state share telic 
meaning, and both are commonly expressed with the perfective and the 
participle. 
Using Ingham's bifurcation of verbs into action and 

6.1 Lexical Aspect 
171 
state/motion categories, two patterns emerge. (1) Participles of action 
verbs can only give perfect meaning when they are telic. (In fact, 
participles of atelic action verbs are rarely, if ever, used in spoken 
Arabic.) In the following sentence, fari/ gives a telic meaning, to read 
[and finish reading] something; it cannot give the reading I am still 
reading this book. 
E 
IJ .... toS.Jl (SJu ; 
. 
-
lissa 'ari k-kitab da 
just having-read the-book that 
I've just read this book 
(2) Participles of stative and motion verbs are used both in telic and 
atelic meanings. An atelic lexical aspect gives rise to interpretations of 
stative or progressive aktionsart, such as fa'da/ sitting in the following 
Egyptian sentence (el-Tonsi 1982:41): 
E 
'I vL.. w t.:u. • .uu -=..:.I 
inti 'acda hina nuff-S saca? 
you sitting here half hour 
Will you be sitting here for (another) half an hour? 
Telic lexical aspect, on the other hand, gives rise to a perfect or resultant 
state reading: 
L 
'I rઆ1 #4 .!lȢ ச !.uU #ઇ 
bacdni 'acid! 1M beddik yani 'urn? 
just-me having-sat! why want-you me I-get-up? 
I've just sat down! Why do you want me to get up? (elicited)

172 
Aspect 
The aspectual reading of the participle can thus be linked directly 
to the context-specific meaning of its verb. If the meaning is telic, the 
participle will give a resultant state (perfect aspect) reading. If the 
meaning is atelic, the participle may be used only to express a progressive 
reading for states and verbs of 'lotion. These findings, summarized in 
Table 6-2, have obvious implications for the aspectual nature of the 
participle, which will be explored in section 6.4. 
6.2 
Formal Aspect 
Formal aspect refers to the way in which a verbal form describes 
the contour of a particular action as an event, process, or state. As 
such, formal aspect cannot always be judged according to grammatical 
correctness; rather, the speaker chooses to describe an action as, for 
example, a process that extends over time, as a completed event viewed 
in its entirety, or as a resultant state. The remainder of this chapter will 
be concerned with the roles that formal aspect plays in the verbal 
system of spoken Arabic, with particular attention to narrative contexts. 
The three main categories of aspect discussed by Comrie (1976) 
are perfective, imperfective, and perfect.s These three categories map 
onto the Arabic system quite neatly, finding expression in the 
imperfective, perfective and participle, respectively. Though these three 
Arabic verb stems may not correspond exactly with perfective and 
imperfective aspects in other languages, they do conform closely to the 
defining characteristics of these aspects as listed by Comrie ( 1976: 18-21, 
24-26). The perfective aspect presents the action as a completed, 
indivisible whole, and contrasts to the imperfective, which describes 
the act!on internally, as a non-complete process, which may be iterative, 
habitual, or progressive. The perfect describes an action as a state that 
bears relevance to the moment of speaking. 
Several dialect grammars have approximated this analysis without 
committing to this terminology and framework. For Moroccan, Harrell 
describes perfective and perfect without using the terms, and he calls 
the imperfective "durative" ( 1962: 173). For Egyptian, Eisele prefers 
not to equate Arabic tense forms with Slavic aspect, but sees an aspectual 
5See also Li, Thompson, and Thompson (1982: 19) and references therein. 

6.2 Formal Aspect 
173 
correspondence between the English 'event' or simple tense forms (e.g., 
go, went) and the Arabic perfective on one hand, and between the 
English 'process' or compound forms (e.g., was going, am going) and 
the Arabic imperfective ( 1990a: 191). AI-Najjar ( 1984:6) uses the terms 
perfective, imperfective, and perfect as I do here, although his study of 
aspect in Kuwaiti focuses on lexical aspect. Ingham also uses the 
terms perfective and imperfective (1994:87), and describes the participle 
as a perfect in the cases noted above (1994:89). 
It is important to distinguish clearly between the perfect and . 
perfective aspects. The overlap in terminology is unfortunate, but 
commonly occurs, and is unavoidable at present, since it would be 
even more confusing to invent new terms for old concepts (see further 
Comrie 1976: 12 and Lyons 1977:714- 15). Comrie uses the term perfect 
to designate "a past situation which has present relevance;" the perfective, 
on the other hand, "denotes a situation viewed in its entirety, without 
regard to internal temporal constituency" (1976: 12). 
These aspects are familiar from other languages. 
Slavic in 
particular grammaticalizes perfective and imperfective aspect in a more 
elaborate system than Arabic, and English has a perfect which is similar 
to the Arabic. 
However, these three aspects are not necessarily 
grammaticalized in exactly the same way in all languages. It need not 
be claimed that Arabic perfective and imperfective are equivalent to 
Slavic, nor that the Arabic perfect matches the English perfect, for 
these terms to be used. It must only be shown that the meanings of 
these Arabic forms conform to general linguistic definitions of these 
aspects. 
Slavic languages have a highly developed aspectual system, with 
separate verb stems for the perfective in various tenses, so that a future 
event can be described as perfective, as a complete, punctual event. 
Arabic does not have separate tenses, and so the expression of a present 
or future event as perfective, as a punctual whole, is much less common 
than the expression of a past event as such (although punctuality may 
be implied by the participle, see 6.4). Arabic may have a less elaborate 
aspectual system than Slavic, but this does not mean that Arabic verbs 
are less aspectual. While the meaning of the Slavic perfective is highly 
punctual, that of the Arabic perfective appears to be more focused on 

174 
Aspect 
the completed nature of the event. Mitchell and EI-Hassan seem to 
concur: "The difference between that which has been realized (fulfilled, 
accomplished, brought about) and that which has not is at the root of 
Arabic distinctions of tense and mood" (1994:8). Cross-linguistically, 
perfective aspect consists of a constellation of features, and its realization 
in a given language may favor one particular feature over others. In 
Arabic, the "completed" feature of the perfective plays a primary role. 
In addition, the 'perfectiveness' of the perfective may vary 
somewhat among different varieties of spoken Arabic. Mitchell contrasts 
the following two Jordanian examples, the first judged by his informants 
to be ungrammatical and the second acceptable (1978:237): 
J 
..:.oXL.. .` ´µI ..:.oi..,:a 
.. qara't il-kitab 'iddit sa'at 
.. [read-past-I the-book several hours] 
.. [I read the book for several hours] 
J 
..:.oXL.. .` ¶µI · ..:.oi..,:a 
qara't fi il-kitab 'iddit sa'at 
[read-past-I in the-book several hours] 
1 read (in) the bookfor several hours 
In the second example, the aspectual nature of the perfective /qara't/ I 
read is altered by the preposition /fit, which permits an atelic 
interpretation of the action that correlates with the adverb /'iddit sa'at/ 
(for) several hours. This use of /fit as an aspectual "durative" particle 
is common in Morocco, Egypt, and the Levant. However, a sentence 
based on Mitchell's Jordanian example and translated into Moroccan 
was rejected by Moroccan informants, who corrected the sentence to: 
Ml 
´t.:.S.J I J.:o.I,., ...i I¸ L:.I,., t-:!I,.,... J t:J)W 
tlata d sway;}' w ana kanqra f wa\:l;}d l-ktab 
three gen hours and I indic-read-I in one the-book 
I've (I had) been reading a bookfor three hours (elicited) 
This judgement suggests that some educated Moroccan speakers, in 
contrast to educated Jordanian speakers, have difficulty associating the 
perfective with a duration of time. The educated register of Mitchell's 
Jordanian speaker, indicated by the glottal stop in /qara't/ 1 read (which 

6.2 Formal Aspect 
175 
in a less formal register would be faret!) ,may also play a role in usage 
here. In any case, a blanket statement on the use of the perfective in 
spoken Arabic is not yet warranted, and more research is needed both 
into regional and social variation.6 
At the other end of the dialect spectrum lie the following examples, 
taken from an interview with an elderly Kuwaiti woman. In this passage, 
she reports a conversation with a male relative, speaking in his voice. 
Noteworthy here is the use of perfectives /r_l).t/ I went and /agget/ she 
called juxtaposed with imperfectives /arfJl)./ I go and /ma a'yi/ I am not 
aware in the same narrative context, even though both verbs clearly 
refer to the same temporal frame. These perfectives indicate recurring 
events, but describe the events as punctual ones fitting within a larger 
series of events.

Similarly, the following passage about how Kuwaiti society used to 
deal with infertility "in the old days" contains perfectives /yat/ she 
came and /tzaww_jaw/ they got married, contrasting with imperfective 
/yańrUn/ they wait: 
6See also Mitchell and EI-Hassan (1994) for a detailed comparison of aspectual 
usages in the educated spoken Arabic of the Levant.

The perfective moves the narrative forward, and serves to foreground 
the events it represents, in contrast to the use of the imperfective to 
provide background descriptions. Foregrounding and backgrounding 
will be explored further in section 6.5. 1 .  
6.3 
Translation and Speaker Point of View 
Anderson's study of aspect as a cross-linguistic category rests on 
the premise that "[a] grammatical category, such as the '[p]erfect,' will 
not have exactly the same range of uses in one language as it does in 
another" ( 1982:227).7 In trying to determine the aspectual meanings of 
verb forms, it is important to allow for two kinds of variables: problems 
that arise in translating across languages, and the degree of control 
maintained by speakers in representing actions and events. For the 
first, if a certain aspectual distinction is made by one language but not 
another, translations that maintain the original distinction may be difficult 
to find. In the case of speaker control, two speakers may report the 
same event or elicit the same information using different aspectual 
forms, depending on the way she or he chooses to represent that event 
or question. The following, while not the only means of asking, represent 
common variants for Do you remember? in each dialect:

7 Anderson proposes a schema for the mapping of uses of the perfect in a 
variety of languages; unfortunately, his discussion of (formal) Arabic focuses 
on what is called here the perfective, not the participle. 

6.3 Translation and Speaker Point a/View 
177 
Do these different verb stems mean that the aspectual systems of the 
dialects differ? Not necessarily. Lexical aspect, formal aspect, and 
speaker attitude all affect the formation of these questions. As the 
Moroccan version suggests, the perfective in Moroccan sometimes has 
a performative function, at least in certain common expressions, such 
as the generalized use of the perfective /bgit! I want and !x-;,ff! must, it 
is necessary. By contrast, in using the imperfective, the Syrian and 
Kuwait questions stress the act of remembering as a process. The 
Egyptian participle contains an implied perfective event as we1l3 but · 
adds to it a relevant resultant state. Moreover, the use of the participle 
in this case goes beyond a request for information to a social interaction: 
by phrasing the request in terms of a resultant, relevant state, the speaker 
adds connotations of shared experience, relevant to the present moment, 
and hence a reinforcing of social or emotional ties. The use of different 
verb stems in these questions may tell us as much about speaker attitudes 
as about the nature of verbal aspect in these dialects. 
Lexically stative verbs, such as to know, interact with aspect in a 
way that defies translation. The context of the following Kuwaiti 
example clarifies the reason for the speaker's choice of the participle 
!'rnif! having learned. An interviewer has asked the speaker about her 
opinion of marriage at a young age. In her reply, the speaker stresses 
that a man should have already come to understand the responsibilities 
of marriage. The use of the participle !'arif! having learned adds this 
dimension of completed comprehension, while the imperfective would 
stress comprehension as an ongoing process.

178 
Aspect 
Adjectives, participles, and verbs can all be stative. In addition, 
the lexical aspect of a number of verbs is "stative." Thus Mitchell and 
El-Hassan ( 1 994:86-87) claim "synonymy" between /'ana 'arif tarix 
al-'arab/ I know Arab history and /'ana ba'rif tarix al-'arab/, I know 
Arab history, not only because of the "stative" nature of the act of 
knowing in both cases, but also because English has only one form to 
express states of knowing. By way of investigating Mitchell and El­
Hassan's claim, I elicited from a linguistically trained Lebanese speaker 
a number of sentences containing the participle /'arif/ knowing, having 
found out and the imperfective /ba'rif/ I know, from which the following 
four have been chosen as representative:

Is it possible to determine the motivation behind the choice of verb 
forms in these contexts? Eisele ( 1990a:204) claims that, in certain 
contexts, the perfective and the perfect can "imply" events and states 
not primarily grammaticalized by the verb form; if this is so, then the 
imperfective should have similar capability. A possible motivation for 
the use of the imperfective in examples (a) and (b) is to imply the 
underlying process of learning a certain body of knowledge, here the 

6.4 Perfect Aspect 
179 
way certain people think and the names of the students. Examples (c) 
and (d), on the other hand, contain no body of knowledge to be learned 
through a process. Rather, the participle indicates a completed knowing, 
or not knowing, as a resultant state that has special relevance to the 
speech act (see 6.4). 
The use of the participle in these and other contexts conforms to 
Li, Thompson, and Thompson's (1982) pragmatics of perfect aspect in 
Chinese. I will cite their findings here not to propose that the Arabic 
perfect is equivalent to the Chinese, but to offer a cross-linguistic ' 
perspective on the functions of perfect aspect. 
6.4 
Perfect Aspect 
Li, Thompson, and Thompson (1982) examine the discourse 
properties of the Mandarin Chinese perfect. They see the same two 
essential, defining properties of the perfect in Chinese that the Arabic 
participle has: stativity, and relevance to reference time. The pragmatic 
functions of the perfect in Chinese include (adapted from 1982:28-37): 
1. to indicate change of state, or change of perception on the part 
of the speaker; 
2. to correct a wrong assumption; 
3. to report progress so far; update, relevance; 
4. to signal what happens next, in a narrative sequence; 
5. to close a statement, marking 'speaker contribution.' 
Of special interest here are functions (1) and (2), because they explain 
the use of the participle in examples (c) and (d) above.8 Example (c) 
represents a loss of perception on the part of the speaker, which falls 
under the rubric of a change in perception. From the point of view of 
the speaker, example (d) corrects the erroneous assumption on the part 
of the interlocutor that the speaker does not know what he is talking 
about. The use of the participle in these particular contexts thus seems 
to follow certain aspectual principles. 
The lack of an equivalent distinction in English between participle 
/'ana (iirif/ I know and imperfective /ha'rif/ I know does not preclude a 
difference in perspective expressed in the Arabic. Just as speakers 
SOther functions also prove relevant to the Arabic perfect, in particular (4) 
"what happens next," which will be discussed further in section 6.5.3. 

180 
Aspect 
control the degree to which they specify or individuate nouns (see 1 .3), 
they also retain a degree of control in choosing the aspectual 
representation of an event. 
Eisele 1990a and Mitchell and EI-Hassan 1994 are reluctant to 
assign a direct relationship between perfect aspect and the participle in 
part because the English perfect is often used to translate the Arabic 
perfective. However, the use of one fonn to translate another form 
from another language does not necessarily establish a grammatical 
equivalence between the two fonns. In a number of European languages, 
the semantic field of the perfect has been gradually expanding at the 
expense of the simple past (Comrie 1976: 1 1). Conversely, the English 
perfect has syntactic restrictions that the Arabic perfect does not. As 
Comrie notes, in English, the specific time reference of the prior event 
may not be expressed. "[Olne cannot say I have got up at five o'clock 
this morning" (Comrie 1976:54). In several dialects of spoken Arabic, 
on the other hand, such a sentence is perfectly acceptable, as these 
elicited sentences show:

Today I (have) got(ten) up at six o'clock (elicited) 
Arabic allows temporal conflation of the prior event and the resultant 
state in a way English does not. In these examples, six o'clock represents 
both the time of the prior event and the onset of the relevant state. In 
contrast, the English perfect precludes overt reference to the exact time 
of the previous event itself, but almost requires overt expression of the 

6.4 Perfect Aspect 
181 
non-specific time frame of the resultant state. Hence one can say in 
English I have just gotten up, but not I have gotten up five minutes ago. 
In the following excerpt, a Kuwaiti matchmaker describes the 
first steps in arranging a marriage. The problem here is the translation 
of the participle Idaggat-lil having called me. An idiomatic English 
translation would favor the use of the English past tense rather than the 
present perfect: the mother called sounds more natural in this context 
than the mother has called.

On the other hand, as Eisele notes, the Arabic perfective may 
often be rendered more idiomatically into English using the English 
present perfect, especially in the case of inchoative verbs (1990a:202): 
E 
.:.l.A j • (,)A଺ 
xalaf, zihi)t 
finished, I-became-bored 
Enough already, I've become annoyed (I'm annoyed) 
Here again, the difference lies in idiomatic expression. English does 
not generally accord grammatical attention to the punctual entry into a 
state, especially if that state is still on-going and relevant. Arabic 
speakers, on the other hand, can choose to represent either the entry 
into the state as a punctual event, or the state resulting from that event. 
Eisele notes that the Arabic perfective "asserts" the event and "implies" 
the resulting state (1990a:204); this implication is not grammatical but 
contextual and translational.

Aspect 
6.4.1 Perfect Aspect and the Participle 
The meaning and function of the active participle in spoken Arabic 
has been under investigation for some time. Johnstone (1967: 142) 
notes of Eastern Arabian dialects that "the syntax of these dialects does 
not differ greatly from that of literary Arabic ... except in the extended 
use of the active participle." Johnstone undoubtedly refers to the 
widespread use in spoken Arabic of participles with verbal force, as 
opposed to participial forms serving as adjectives, impersonal predicates 
or frozen forms (such as /lazim/ must, it is necessary), a distinction 
maintained here as well. 
But if it is correct to assign perfect aspect to the participle, as is 
claimed here, then its near absence from written genres with a verbal 
meaning does not result from difference in syntax between written and 
spoken Arabic so much as in differences in discourse type and context. 
Written language is often distanced from the force of relevance to the 
speech act. It may be precisely the relevance aspect of the participle 
that precludes its extensive use in most written contexts, especially 
expository writing. The perfect aspect would therefore be a feature of 
language more naturally associated with spoken, not written, language.9 
The aspectual nature of the participle in a number of dialects has 
been analyzed by Wild (1964), Woidich (1975), Mitchell (1978), el-Tonsi 
( 1 982), AI-Najjar ( 1984), Eisele ( 1 988, 1990a), and Ingham (1994). 
Some of these analyses have attempted to codify the use of the active 
participle with various time references; all have investigated the nuances 
of its aspectual meanings. 
Terms like 'resultative' and 'stative' are often used to describe the 
participle. Mitchell (1978:230), AI-Najjar (1984), and Holes ( 1990) 
hint at a relationship between perfect aspect and the active participle, 
but stop short of associating the two. Ingham recognizes the perfect 
9Li, Thompson and Thompson's research on Chinese supports this theory: 
they find that the Chinese perfect is "very rare in expository and scientific 
writing and practically non-existent in news-reporting, speeches, lectures ... 
[and descriptive writing]" (1982:26). Only in narratives is the Chinese perfect 
likely to occur. In Classical Arabic, then, one would expect to find participles 
with perfect aspect in literary anecdotes and narratives. It is my impression 
that this is precisely the context in which this use of the participle most 
frequently occurs; however, this speculation awaits further research. 

6.4 Perfect Aspect

nature of participles in Najdi Arabic: "it [is] possible to interpret the 
[a]ctive participle as meaning having begun to ... or having performed 
the initial action which results in the state of .. . " (1994:91). However, 
he too is reluctant to assign perfect aspect to the participle because of 
the progressive reading of participles of certain state and motion verbs. 
Eisele ( 1990a) labels the participle as "stative." While the 
participle clearly represents a state, stativity is not in and of itself the 
defining characteristic of the participle. First, as noted above, the term 
'stative' is also used to denote one type of lexical aspect. Verbs of 
epistemic knowledge in most languages are stative: to know, to perceive, 
and to believe all refer to states of knowledge rather than acts. Thus 
'stativity' is not limited to the participle, but is also a lexical quality 
inherent in certain types of verbs. Secondly, copulative sentences, 
including those containing a null-copula, may also be said to represent 
a state, whether permanent or not. Finally, it is not the stative quality 
of participles alone that lends them their aspectual nature. Rather, it is 
the resultative and relevance features that allow participles to be 
associated with the perfect aspect. Stativity is therefore a necessary 
but not sufficient quality of the perfect aspect. 
The following examples demonstrate the importance of the 
resultative (relevance to speech act) character of the participle. In each 
case, the participle denotes a state resulting from a prior act and concurrent 
and relevant to the speech context. (The question of time reference 
will be taken up in Chapter 7.) 
The female character in this story is able to recognize her son 
years later because the angels had marked him when he was born with 
certain birthmarks, and the resultant state is crucial to her recognition:

These participles all fit the defmition of perfect aspect: the resultant 
state of a prior action that has special relevance to the speech act.

6.4.2 Participles of Motion 
The biggest problem presented by the participle as a grammatical 
form is that a small category dominated by participles of motionlO 
seem to behave in an altogether different manner than the participles 
cited above. Rather than indicating the resultant state of a prior act, 
these particular motion participles often indicate a progressive act. Hence 
E,S /masi/ can mean both going and having left, and E, S, K /nazil/ 
either going down/out or having gone. The participle /waŻil/, on the 
other hand, can only mean having arrived in all four dialects. 
In Egyptian, /rayity./ means only going, not having gone. Kuwaiti 
speakers, however, use this participle in both meanings. In the following 
passage, the speaker recounts his last birthday party, listing the 
preparations undertaken by his friends. Past time reference is established 
by contextual framing. The participle of motion /rayty.in/ having gone 
is clearly parallel in aspect to /msawwin/ having made, /Sarin/ having 
bought, and /yaybin/ having brought.

AI-Najjar notes, but does not explain, the use of /rayity./ going and other 
participles of motion with both progressive and perfect meanings 
(1984: 145). 
The existence of what appear to be two contradictory usages of 
the same form has motivated various analyses of the participle along 
IOMitchell and EI-Hassan (1994) point out that translocation is a more 
appropriate term for this category of verbs, since it is verbs expressing movement 
from one location to another that exhibit this behavior. I will use motion in 
the sense of translocation.

semantic lines, as seen in section 6. 1 .  Eisele's solution to this problem 
is to call the perfect usage "non-characteristic" with respect to aspect 
( 1990a:204). An alternate explanation is offered here, one that views 
this as an historical problem, resulting in the development of a secondary, 
stative meaning. 
As any dictionary of Arabic shows, many Arabic verbs have a 
range of meanings both telic and atelic. The problem of the motion 
class participles is resolved by viewing the range of telic and atelic 
meanings inherent in each verb. The verb /miW can mean, in different 
contexts, to walk, to go, and to set out to go somewhere, leave. If 
/miTi/ is understood to mean to set out to go rather than the process of 
going. the semantic extension of /maW from perfect having set out to 
progressive in a state of going is not problematic, but well within the 
normal parameter of perfect meaning. Verbs meaning to go can carry 
both telic (to go somewhere) and ate lie (to set out) meanings; it is the 
atelic meaning of these verbs that gives rise to the interpretation of the 
participle as motion in progress. 
The overwhelming preponderance of evidence from a number of 
dialects thus confirms that the basic aspectual nature of the participle is 
perfect. The question of time reference, however, is a different one 
entirely, and will be examined in Chapter 7. 
6.5 
Aspect in Narrative Contexts 
This overview of aspect in spoken Arabic will conclude with a 
brief look at aspect in narratives across dialects. Narratives provide a 
range of meanings of forms and structures. While ostensibly about 
another time and place. narratives are often present in a way that 
emphasizes the relevance to the moment of speaking: to be as close as 
possible to the audience, the narrative context is brought into the here 
and now. Narrative uses of verb forms are strikingly similar across 
dialects, and reflect the centrality of aspect to the verbal system of 
Arabic. 
The use of the so-called "historical present," the progressive present 
that relates past events, is a well-known cross-linguistic phenomenon 
also common in Arabic. The following Kuwaiti narrative shifts abruptly 

6.5 Use of Aspect in Narrative Contexts 
187 
from perfective to imperfective at a moment of tension, when the narrator 
discovers that his friend is no longer speaking to him. Perfective verbs 
/ga'adt/ I got up, and /ala' raQ/ he left [and] went, move the plot 
forward, while the imperfective forms, fagul! I say, and /ma YQacini/ 
he doesn't speak to me, as a kind of historical present, heighten the 
immediacy of these actions:

neg he-speaks-to-me left-he want-he the-work 
The next day I got up in the morning and I say good morning to 
M. and he doesn't talk to me! He left and went to work. 
However, the historical present does not by itself explain non-past 
usage of imperfective forms in spoken Arabic. The historical present 
in English often consists of event forms, like a recent television 
commercial for a kind of toothpaste, in which the speaker relates a past 
event using present forms: My dad picks me up at the airport, and 
right there on the highway he starts examining my teeth! As Eisele 
notes, the English event form is parallel to the Arabic perfective (1990a), 
so the use of present tense event forms in English narratives cannot be 
equated with the use of the imperfective in Arabic which, while conveying 
the narrative immediacy of a relative non-past occurrence, describes 
the event in a different fashion. Another unexplained feature of Arabic 
narratives is that many of them combine perfective and imperfective 
forms, both describing past events. Clearly, aspect is involved in the 
choice of forms in narrative. The next four sections describe different 
strategies Arabic speakers use in narration. 
6.5.1 Foregrounding and Backgrounding 
Hopper has identified what he calls "a universal of narrative 
discourse," a phenomenon he calls fore grounding and backgrounding 
( 1979:213). These terms refer to the "parts of the narrative which 
relate events belonging to the skeletal structure of the discourse," and 

188 
Aspect 
the "supportive material which does not itself narrate the main events" 
(1979:213). This discourse universal is realized with different strategies 
across languages, but a number of core syntactic and semantic phenomena 
can be identified, including aspect. Several languages studied by Hopper 
use "event" forms to move the narrative along, and "process" forms to 
describe the internal content of supporting or descriptive material. Arabic 
follows this pattern as well: the perfective and the imperfective verb 
stems are used to narrate and describe, respectively. The perfective 
relates the event or action as a completed whole, while the imperfective 
provides a picture of event as process, and opens it up for internal 
viewing.1 1  
A typical narrative, the following text contains both perfective 
and imperfective forms. The choice between them is motivated by 
status of the events themselves within the narrative: the former represent 
actions that move the plot forward, the latter descriptive or scene-setting 
material. Background is given using imperfective forms /t'ul-lu/ she 
says to him and /tTUf/ she looks, in both cases preceded by the participle 
of motion /gayya/ coming. The plot of the narrative moves forward 
through the perfective verb forms, /'al-Iaha/ he told her, /miTi/, he left, 
and /la'it/ she found.

IIHopper's analysis suggests that he would see the historical development of 
the Arabic perfective and imperfective as, in part, a natural consequence of 
this discourse universal. Arabic features such as word order and the suffixed 
and prefixed forms of the verb stems seem to fit his framework.

The next passage, from Morocco, shows similar use of the verb forms. 
The only event that belongs to the plot here is the king's setting up a 
private room for his only daughter, /dar-Iha/ he made for her. The 
background description of the room itself is carried out using imperfective 
verb forms, /ma txra'g/, she doesn't go out, /ma tdxal§/, she doesn't 
come in, /makatnOQJ/ she doesn't get up.

This next excerpt shows more of the story's plot, and most of the 
verbs are perfective. The imperfective verb, /tatbat/ she spends the 
night stands out as a description tangential to the main plot events:

Where is she, poor thing? When they left her on the road, and

The choice of verb form in narrative, then, has at least as much 
to do with aspect as with tense or time reference. The descriptive, 
scene-setting events and states reported with the imperfective in these 

190 
Aspect 
passages are not unimportant to the narrative, just to the forward motion 
of its basic plot. Indeed, the background descriptions are what make 
the narrative vivid; without them, there would be a plot but no story. 
Alternating between perfective and imperfective forms can have 
other uses as well. In the following text, a Kuwaiti match-maker 
describes her work. She has been relating the process of taking a man 
to see a prospective bride. She uses the perfective aspect to summarize 
the events she narrated in the previous section, presenting these events 
as points along a time line, seen externally. Returning to the imperfective 
opens up the internal description of an action, permitting the speaker to 
describe events as processes, rather than as one-time events.

She asks him, we sat, and he asked her and she asked him,

or did you not like the girl? 
The following Egyptian narrative contains a background 
description involving three verbs: /biyi'fiz/ he jumps, /nisi/ he forgot 
and /yiliff/ he would run around, all in parallel syntactic construction, 
and all taking place in immediate succession, and yet they alternate 
between perfective and imperfective. Particularly surprising is the use 
of the perfective /nisi/ he forgot in between two imperfective verbs. 
This may be a consequence of the interaction of formal and lexical 
aspect, in that the imperfective /byinsa/ he forgets can only give a 
habitual reading, whereas the context clearly calls for what Eisele (1990b) 
calls an "event form." Here, the perfective /nisi/ he forgot must be

used to give the force of an event, emphasizing the momentary lapse of 
consciousness.

The next passage contains a Syrian's description of a year of 
living in the United States. The events all took place in the past, yet 
they are described here using imperfective forms, because they are 
viewed and presented by the speaker as habitual or recurring actions. 
Conversely, the use of the perfective here, as for example !kanu 'am 
bimaUUu klabon/ they were walking their dogs, would indicate that the 
action occurred only once, for /,am/ cannot mark habitual action. Context 
dictates a past-time reference for these events, because the speaker was 
no longer residing in the U.S. at the time of the interview, and so these 
events could not have been occurring in a (then-)present time frame.

However, foregrounding and backgrounding do not explain all of 
the verb fonn usages in narrative texts. Two other patterns of usage 

192 
Aspect 
may be detected in spoken Arabic narratives. One is the use of certain 
verbs, mainly verbs of motion, to give narrative texts aspectual contour, 
and the other involves the use of imperfective and participle forms in 
special constructions to highlight sudden events. 
Both of these 
constructions contour the sequencing of events, indicating a sudden or 
important event. The use of the participle in these contexts bears 
striking parallel to Li, Thompson and Thompson's function of the perfect 
in Chinese to signal the next event in a narrative (see 6.4). 
6.5.2 Aspect and Narrative Contour 
Discourse fore grounding and backgrounding help explain the 
choice of aspectual forms in narrative. In addition, a group of verbs 
consisting of certain verbs of motion seem to play a role in highlighting 
narrative events. AI-Najjar 1984 examines some of these verbs at 
length in his study of aspect in Kuwaiti. He calls these verbs "aspectual," 
and so they are, but theirs is lexical aspect. Since they seem as a group 
to mark the twists and turns of narrative events, I will tentatively call 
their function "narrative contour." Some of these verbs seem to allow 
verb phrases to combine two lexical aspects, punctual and 
stative/progressive, for certain narrative purposes. 
Speakers use this tool in two ways. Some of these verbs control 
the narrative "dimension" of actions, to add some highlight to a 
backgrounded action or event, or to add a stative or progressive dimension 
to a foregrounded event. Another function is to give contour to the 
narrative as a whole, by drawing the attention of the listener to the next 
in a series of foregrounded events.12 The most commonly occurring 
"contʹuring" verbs in my data are listed in Table 6-3. This partial 
listing should suffice to give a general idea of this proposed group, 
which contains striking semantic parallels across dialects. Even where 
individual lexical items differ, their semantic fields correspond (e.g., to 
get up, Moroccan /nacJ./ and Egyptian and Syrian /'am/). 
Syntactically, these verbs exhibit unique behavior in that they 
may be followed by non-embedded (modally or temporally) verbs in 
12Palva (1991 )  and Caubet (1995) have studied uses of the verb /'la/ to come 
in Jordanian and Moroccan dialect narratives respectively, analyzing the 
narrative functions of this particular verb.

asyndetic construction. Mitchell and El-Hassan dismiss this feature as 
simple coordination (1994: 1 13); while this may be true, the fact remains 
that no other verbs may be coordinated asyndetically in this manner.

Verbs meaning to go combine the idea of physical motion, the 
act of going somewhere, with the end result, expressed by the following

the different lexical aspects to color or contour each other so that the 
motion and the end result are conveyed together as a whole, seen from 
both perspectives at once.

The verb to come is used similarly in the dialects, and differs from to 
go in physical or psychological perspective, depending on where the 
speaker locates himself or herself with respect to the actions involved. 
Subsequent actions in narrative, and particularly sudden or 
surprising ones, are often introduced by verbs whose lexical meaning is 
to get up, stand up: Moroccan /nag/, Egyptian and Syrian /'am/, and 
Kuwaiti /gam/, as these examples show:l3

I஬his narrative use of /gam/ in Kuwaiti differs slightly from another use of 
this verb as a temporal verb, discussed in Chapter 7. In the latter, /gam/ 
indicates the onset of an action or a change of state, and is followed by an 
imperfective. In narrative usage, /gam/ signals subsequent action and may be 
followed by a perfective verb, or a participle in some dialects.

These verbs also function as verbs of beginning (see further7.2). 
Verbs meaning to sit down combine with following imperfectives 
(of action verbs only, not stative or motion verbs) to lend continuous or 
progressive aktionsart to an action. In Kuwaiti, the participle of this 
verb functions as a progressive marker for imperfective verbs (8.3.3). 
The verb /tamm/ to complete occurs in all dialect regions. Harrell 
notes that /tamm/ (originally, to complete) in Moroccan is used with 
participles of motion (1962: 184).14 If his definition is expanded to 
include stative participles, it can apply to Egyptian and Syrian as well. 
Harrell does not give a meaning for /tamml, noting that it adds "tense" 
to the following participle. His description can be refmed: as a narrative 
contour verb, /tamm/ allows the combination of completed or punctual 
aspect and the continuous aktionsart of the following participle to give 
both a sense of the duration of a state or translocation and its completion 
up to a certain (often implied) point in time, as these examples show: 
M7 /.!4-
.-,.;':; 
tammit fay 
continued-I coming-ms

14Harrell's counterexample of /tamm/ followed by a perfective is arguably a 
misinterpretation: reading /tamm mhuwwed/ for Harrell's /tamm huwwed/ he 
went down (1962:184), all attested examples contain participles.

The Egyptian pseudo-verb /tann/ probably derives from this verb. 
Badawi and Hinds note that /tann/ signals "the continuousness or 
habitualness of an action or state" or "the immediate succession of one 
action or state to another" (1986: 139), and give its truncated conjugation 
forms which show a partial loss of subject agreement and acquisition 
of the logical subject as an object. Their examples include the following 
pair, both of which show the combination of continuousness with the 
perfectivity of completion. Here, the implied end or completion points 
are not temoral but physical: the interior of a structure and the arrival 
at the company, respectively.

Kuwaiti /tamm/ seems to focus on the second meaning that Badawi 
and Hinds give for /tann/, the immediate succession of events (a function 
that all narrative contour verbs share, but in different senses). In my 
Kuwaiti data, /tamm/ occurs only in the speech of one elderly woman, 
who uses it with a following perfective, as if to signal a logically 
subsequent event, or movement forward chronologically and logically. 
In the first example, the speaker has been describing a series of meetings

parents have prevented the girl and her beloved from marrying. -The 
next event is:

Verbs meaning to return, resume signal either a narrative return 
to or the resumption of a previously mentioned action, with the effect 
of bringing a section of narrative "full circle." The first example 
shows the use of Moroccan /'awed/ to return to indicate the close of a 
circular series of events (example from Harre11 1962:184-5):

The following Syrian passage demonstrates the use of /'ad/ to 
return to mark a return to a previous action. Here the speaker describes 
a rather involved process of renting a house in the United States, a 
process that includes her landlady acquiring the approval of the neighbors. 
The use of /'adit/ she went back followed by perfective fajjaritna/ she 
rented to us returns the narrative explanation to the point of origin and 
closes the narrative circle, signalling the end of this part of the narrative.

The striking parallels in meanings and functions of these verbs 
across dialects suggest that verbal narrative devices in spoken Arabic 
warrant further comparative attention. 
6.5.3 Suddenly, all of a sudden with Participle 
Most of these dialects (I lack evidence for Moroccan) make use 
of participles in narrative in similar ways, preceded by a verb of motion 
and indicating a next event. This usage of the perfect aspect coincides 
with the description of one the functions of the Chinese perfect by Li, 
Thompson, and Thompson: to signal "what happens next, this has just 
happened/is about to happen" (1982:36). This function explains the 
use of the aspectual nature of the participle to highlight sudden or 
important plot events. 
Egyptian favors the verbs /ral).l to go and ramI to get up with the 
participle. In this passage, from a film plot narrative, the villain ram 
l:taiV up and put his briefcase, an act intended to confuse the heroine:

The next passage shows the function of /ral:t/ with a following participle 
to indicate subsequent action. When the captain of the ship tells the 
mate to stop /wa"af/ the ship, the narrator says, /rul:tna mu'Va"afin/ 
[and so} we went and stopped (Behnstedt 1980:42, translation mine):

6.5.4 Suddenly with the Imperfective 
Finally, the two peripheral dialects use the imperfective in ways 
that do not seem to be paralleled in the central dialects. Harrell identifies 
a Moroccan construction he calls a circumstantial clause (!Qal/) as a 
commonly used narrative technique. Structurally, this construction 
does resemble the circumstantial clause, in that it consists of /w/ followed 
by a pronoun and an unmarked imperfective; however, the meaning of 
this construction differs, as it does not denote an event simultaneous to 
a- main verb, but rather a sequential action. Harrell notes that this 

6.6 Summary 
201 
construction "carries the implication of thereupon ocforthwith, suddenly" 
(1962: 175). The following passage contains an example, /w huwwa 
Y'Jrzac/ suddenly he returns:

passed-it one the-week sat-he in-it and-he he-return 
A week passed during which he stayed, and suddenly he returns 
This unusual use of the imperfective may function as a kind of historical 
present. 
Similarly, in Kuwaiti narratives, the modal /Ùan/ had, would 
precedes an imperfective to indicate a foregrounded action, sometimes 
sudden. This device occurs frequently in the narratives of a young 
male speaker:

In other cases, this use of /Ùan/ with an imperfective looks very much 
like a kind of historical present, and it will be revisited in that context 
in section 7.1 .  
6.6 
Summary 
This discussion of aspect in spoken Arabic has distinguished 
between lexical aspect, which refers to semantic features inherent to 
the meaning(s) of a particular verb, and formal aspect, which is viewed 
here as being grammaticalized in Arabic in the morphological forms 
perfective, imperfective, and participle. 
Previous studies of lexical aspect have classified verbs in a number 
of categories according to the meanings of the morphological forms, 
resulting in a complex representation of the interaction of formal and 

202 
Aspect 
lexical aspectual meaning. The aspectual meanings of the participle 
present a special problem in Arabic, since some participles carry perfect 
aspect (a relevant, resultant state) while others give a stative or progressive 
aktionsart, resembling an imperfective aspect. This problem is solved 
by distinguishing between telic and atelic lexical meanings, resulting in 
a simplified prediction of participial meaning. Telic verbs have perfect 
aspect, and atelic verbs of motion and stative verbs give rise to progressive 
interpretation. Atelic action verbs cannot be used in participial form. 
Formal aspect, following Comrie ( 1976) and others, is defined as 
a way of describing the internal constituency of an action or event. 
The three verb stems, perfective, imperfective, and participle, correspond 
to the three major cross-linguistic types of formal aspect in language: 
perfective, imperfective, and perfect. The usage of the participle across 
dialect regions corresponds closely to descriptions of perfect aspect in 
other languages, among them Chinese. Functions of the perfect in both 
Arabic and Chinese include indicating a change of perception, correcting 
a wrong assumption, and signalling sudden or important events in a 
narrative (Li, Thompson, and Thompson 1982). 
I have argued here for the primacy of aspect to the verbal system 
of spoken Arabic, especially in the choice of verb forms in narrative 
contexts. As a means of representation, aspect is controlled by the 
speaker, who chooses aspectual representation according to his or her 
perspective of an action or event. In narrative contexts, Arabic speakers 
consistently choose aspectual representation over external (deictic) 
temporal representation. 
A certain core group of verbs of motion, parallel across dialects, 
plays important roles in narrative texts, signalling subsequent or 
immediately successive. action, the ordering of events, the beginning 
and final actions in a logical series, and the combination of lexical 
aspects in a single action. Speakers of all dialect regions employ 
narrative contour verbs in strikingly similar fashion to give aspectual 
depth to narratives. 
These conclusions are not meant to deny a role for time reference 
in the verb system of spoken Arabic, the topic of the next chapter. 

7 TENSE AND TIME REFERENCE 
7.0 
Introduction 
After years of debate over the temporal or aspectual nature of 
Arabic verbs, the trend in most recent studies has been to view the 
verbal system of spoken Arabic as combining aspect and time reference 
(Eisele 1988, Ingham 1994). Chapter 6 presented evidence supporting 
the centrality of aspect to the verbal system of spoken Arabic . If the' 
morphological forms of the verb are aspectual and temporal, as has 
been argued, what role does time reference play? This chapter will 
examine mechanisms through which time reference is established in 
the four dialects. 
Following Eisele, a distinction will be made here between the 
terms tense and time reference (1988:49). Tense refers to morphological 
verb forms, and time reference to the role of these forms (and other 
sentence elements) in establishing the location in time of actions, events 
and states with respect to the reference time. In other words, the 
Arabic perfective and imperfective represent morphological categories 
that interact with other grammatical features to produce time reference. 
Time reference is understood in this study to be a feature of the sentence 
as a whole, and even beyond the bounds of the sentence, of the discourse 
unit.t Time reference may be determined by a number of different 
sentential and contextual means, including verbs, clausal structure, 
discourse context, and, in some dialects, certain non-deictic adverbs. 
Most previous studies of Arabic verbal systems have aimed to 
establish the basic or context-independent meaning of verb forms, as 
opposed to context-specific meaning. Full investigation has yet to be 
made of the use and meaning of verbs in narrative and conversational 
contexts. The goal here is to describe naturally occurring speech patterns, 
with particular attention to narrative contexts. 
Eisele's study of tense, aspect and time reference in Cairene 
Arabic (1988, 1990a) represents the first serious attempt to define the 
(The term 'discourse unit' has yet to be defined in terms of length or 
composition, but it has been shown to exist by studies of definiteness and 
referentiality (see e.g. Wald 1983, Khan 1988). 
203 

204 
Tense alld Time Reference 
relationship between tense and aspect in spoken Egyptian Arabic. His 
analysis of the context-independent meaning of the verb forms in 
Egyptian Arabic forms concludes that tense forms in Cairene Arabic 
have "two primary meanings ... time reference and aspect" ( 1990a: 190). 
Eisele characterizes the verbal system of Cairene as a past/non-past 
dichotomy of the morphological tenses, a framework taken as the point 
of departure here. 
However, this chapter will expand his context­
independent framework to include context-dependent tense as well. 
It is maintained here that Comrie's ( 1 976:80) assessment of 
Classical Arabic, that the perfective and imperfective represent relative 
past and relative non-past respectively, holds true for the dialects as 
well. Two mechanisms can shift relative time reference from the moment 
of speaking to another point, past or future: embedding, which shifts 
the reference point to the main clause, and tense neutralization, a discourse 
mechanism. These two mechanisms allow aspect to play a greater role 
than time reference in the choice of verb form in many contexts. In 
addition, a special class of verbs called here temporal verbs has as its 
primary function the establishment of time reference. Finally, it will 
be argued that some of the confusion over the interpretation of the 
meaning of the participle arises from the attempt to associate time 
reference with it. As Holes notes, the participle is a tense less form that 
does not signal any particular time reference (1990: 1 89). 
7.1 Relative Time Reference in Arabic 
The Arabic tense system is inherently tied to context. Cowell 
(1964:340) and Mitchell and EI-Hassan ( 1994:65) define main clause 
time reference as being relative to the moment of speaking. In fact, it 
can be argued that this "default" reference of the moment of speech is 
grammaticalized in Arabic, because time reference is not marked in 
copulative to be (also called equational) sentences unless it is past or 
future. In the following sentences, the absence of a tensed form indicates 
that the time reference is understood to be the moment of speech.

The perfective and imperfective also locate an action relative to 
the moment of speech, as past and non-past, respectively. However, 
this point of reference may be overridden or shifted by grammatical 
processes or discourse contexts. These processes and contexts are the 
subject of the following sections. 
7.1.1 Adverbs and Relative Time Reference 
In the eastern dialects, the temporal reference point may be shifted 
from the moment of speech to a past or future point by means of 
adverbs. Evidence from Kuwaiti in particular indicates that non-deictic 
adverbs can collocate with imperfective verb forms to establish past 
time reference. In the first example, the adverb /'awwal/ in the old 
days shifts the reference point of the verb /'axaf/ I (was] afraid.

comp I-go and I-come 
He told me, Go, he gave me permission, that is. Before. I {used 
to be] afraid to come and go 
Both grammars of Gulf Arabic agree on this point, and give 
supporting examples. Johnstone notes that "the imperfect[ive] indicates 
an incomplete act in the present or future, less frequently an incomplete 
event in the past" (1967: 143). His example:

Tense and Time Reference 
K 
ǒǓ1 0""',J$ 
yriiJ:tUn il-kwet 
[they-go the-Kuwait] 
They used to go, would go to Kuwait 
Holes is even more explicit (1990:26-7): 
It is frequently the case, in certain types of discourse, that an 
adverbial clause of time is used to set a 'past' time frame for the 
main clause ... In such cases, the main clause verbs do not need 
to be marked for past time. 
Holes identifies this mechanism as narrative-specific; however, the 
narrative context may be quite limited in scope, since time reference is 
easily "retrieved" by native speakers from a number of dialects. Egyptian 
and Syrian speakers easily accept a past time reference for sentences 
like the immediately preceding Kuwaiti one. A Syrian informant judged 
the following elicited sentence acceptable: 
S3 
͸ J,Jǔ V"WI 0L.j rg1 
'ayyam zaman in-nas bitzUr ba'<;l[h]a 
days of-(old)-time the-people indic-she-visit each-other 
In the old days, people {would} visit each other 
Mitchell and EI-Hassan cite an example from Jordan containing 
imperfectives /byTraJ:t/ he explains and /bya'ti/ he gives referring to past 
events ( 1994:66).

Moroccan informants, by contrast, categorically reject sentences like:

However, my Moroccan corpus includes a number of examples 
of imperfective verbs referring to past events, including imperfective 
/tat:lbqa/ she remains in the following, taken from a passage in which 
the speaker recalls problems with her mother-in-law as a young bride: 
M2

'iwa w tat:lbqa tatxaom w tatdbqa tat --
well indic-she-remains indic-she-quarrels and indic-she-remains 
indic-she --
She [would] keep quarrelling, and she [would] keep -- [pause] 
The larger context of this utterance marks its past context, and hence 
interpretation. A possible conclusion would be that Moroccan speakers 
cannot retrieve past narrative reference as easily as speakers of other 
dialects. Time reference in discourse will be discussed in 7. 1.3; for 
now, I will note in passing that the two dialects whose aspectual system 
is arguably the most "conservative," or closest to classical Arabic usage, 
appear to differ in their acceptance of adverbially marked relative time 
reference. Moroccan speakers seem to have the most difficulty accepting 
past readings of imperfective, while Kuwaiti speakers more easily retrieve 
past time reference for imperfective verbs. This unexpected contrast 
suggests that aspect and time reference do not necessarily relate 
reciprocally; that is, a loss or shift in one category does not have 
automatic implications for the other. 
7.1.2 Relative Time Reference in Complement Clauses 
While time reference in the main clause is relative to the moment 
of speaking, time reference in complemental clauses is relative to that 
of the main clause (cf. Cowell 1964:340). This tense shift represents a 
syntactic means of transferring the reference point from the moment of 
utterance to another point in time? The imperfective in this case indicates 
concurrence with the main verb, while the perfective signals past relative 
to the main clause, or a pluperfect. 
2Comrie's (1985) investigation of tense and time reference as a cross-linguistic 
syntactic category makes a parallel distinction between what he calls "absolute" 
and "relative" tense. Relative tense has to do with subordinate tense relations, 
or other means of establishing time reference such as adverbs (1985:63), 

208 
Tense and Time Reference 
Sentential complements show relative tense to the main clause. 
The following pairs contrast relative past and relative concurrent or 
future reference (examples elicited):

'rft b-lli gadi ymsi b-I)alu 
found-out-I comp fut-he-Ieave 
with-himself 
I found out that he was going to 
leave 
Relative clauses also show relative tense. The first example, 
from Morocco, shows a relative clause containing a perfective, /zat! 
she had come, signalling a pluperfect time reference with respect to the 
main clause verb phrase, /kant xarZa/ she was going out: 
M2 ,=, ..:.4- > I i.u I"J 1 4). ":"':'lS 
kant xarza l-walida lli fat l-'ndi 
was-she going-out the-mother rel came-she at-me 
My mother, who had come to my house, was going out 
The Egyptian speaker here uses a perfective /iStareti/ you bought in a 
relative clause that is subordinate to the main verb, /ragga'ti/ you returned:

Did you take back the dress you had bought from St. Michel? 
The next example shows the participle, /ba'itton/ she having sent them, 
in a relative clause giving a past perfect reading, even though the 
participle has no time reference of its own (see further 7.3):

In the following Kuwaiti example, the time reference of imperfective 
/'abi/ I want[ ed] is concurrent with the main verb /g::lnni/ he dropped 
me off: 
K3 
<r.' /I utSll ਉ 
ganni iI-mekan illi 'abi 
dropped-he-me the-place reI I-want 
He dropped me off at the place I wanted 
Equational sentences that are subordinate to a main clause are 
understood to be concurrent with the time frame of that main clause. 
Circumstantial clauses (Arabic /I:l all) , which describe the state or 
circumstance of a sentence agent or topic, are by definition concurrent 
with the main clause they help modify. 
Typical examples of 
circumstantial clauses, marked and subordinated by /w(i)/ and, when, 
include:

210 
Tense and Time Reference 
Other subordinate clauses, too, contain imperfective verbs whose 
time reference is present relative to the main clause. The following 
Syrian example shows an adverbial clause with imperfective /iJ:tki/ [ 
talk referring to a past recurring event: 
S5 
&+a- ȘI ਈI,J &+a- Ș I La :u . t.:..:. 1ଞ .:.,.-. UJ.J I ¤

the-language 
[ learned the language from our neighbors, so much [ talked with 
them and was forced to talk with them [ learned the language 
from them 
7.1.3 Discourse Shift of Time Reference: Tense Neutralization 
It was noted in 7. 1 . 1  that Holes correlates the syntactic shift of 
time reference associated with non-deictic adverbs with narrative 
contexts. Even a sentence-length narrative frame suffices to allow 
shifts in time reference. Moreover, narrative contexts allow relative 
past time reference even without adverbs. Comrie calls this process 
tense neutralization (1985: 103- 104). Tense neutralization, which occurs 
in narrative sequencing, provides for one verb to establish a past time 
reference for subsequent non-past verbs, when the discourse proceeds 
as an uninterrupted sequence (similar to English speakers' use of the 
'historical present'). This discourse mechanism for shifting time reference 
depenqs in part on the assumption of a "natural" interpretation of events 
as being sequential and chronological, and allows aspect to play a 
primary role in the choice of verb form. 
The following examples show that time reference may be 
established outside the sentence, either by other sentences which are 
marked for past time, or by the context of the discourse itself. In the 
following Moroccan passage, the speaker establishes the time frame 
initially, with the perfective verb /dwwnna/ we passed, and once 
having done so, does not need to repeat the past time reference; the 
remainder of the clauses contain imperfectives or the zero-copula:

Finally, a Syrian speaker talks about a period of time she spent in the 
United States. She establishes past time reference with /inbasaë;}t/ I

Functioning like the colloquial American English expression I 
go, this /ean/ often precedes the verb /gal! to say, ostensibly to alert the 
listener to ensuing direct speech central to the narrative. Unlike the 
conditional use of /ean/ (see 8.7), the mood here is not counterfactual 
but factual. Clauses introduced with /ean/ seem to play a key role in 
Kuwaiti narratives, much like clauses using the historical present in 
English. If indeed these uses of /ean/ indicate the development of a 
narrative historical present marker, it represents a unique development 
among these dialects, and bears watching for future developments. 
7.2 Temporal Verbs 
Chapter 5 proposed a category of temporal verbs, motivated by 
their semantic function, to mark onset, duration, cessation, or continuity 
of an action or state, and their behavior as temporal but not modal 
embedders. Table 7- 1 includes a list of common temporal verbs. 
Some of the verbs included in this group, such as /nağ/ and /gam/ 
to get up, begin, and /'acad, ga'ad/ to sit, continue, also function as 
narrative contour verbs, verbs that combine time reference with lexical 
and formal aspect to give an internal contour to narrative actions or 
events (6.5.2). Temporal verbs combine time reference and lexical 
aspect, and the two groups show a degree of overlap. However, temporal 
verbs are not limited to narrative contexts. And while translocative 
verbs occur asyndetically conjoined to following verbs or participles in 
narrative contexts without subordinating them, temporal verbs as a

group show more complex relationships to the verbs whose time frame 
they provide. I will examine here certain syntactic characteristics 
particular to temporal verbs, with the caveat that some of these 
characteristics pertain only to core members of this set.

7.2.1 Temporal Verbs in Compound Verb Phrases 
Chapter 5 argued that temporal verbs constitute a unique class of 
verbs because they embed other verbs temporally but not modally. 
Here the dialects will be compared according to the syntactic restrictions 
on embedding by temporal verbs in Moroccan, Egyptian, and Syrian 
(Kuwaiti does not mark syntactic embedding). 
Moroccan speakers allow a following indicative with all temporal 
verbs. Harrell's examples include (1962: 181-2): 

216

Syrian speakers have two marked imperfectives at their disposal: 
an indicative with /h/ and a progressive with /<am/ (regional variant 
/mma/). The latter is commonly used with temporal verbs, as the 
following examples with /kant to be and /ma cadi no longer show:

However, the unmarked imperfective more commonly marks a 
past habitual action embedded by /kan!. Cowell (1964:336) and Mitchell 
and EI-Hassan (1994:98) note that the b-imperfective following /kant is 
generally reserved for use in conditional environments (see also 8.4). 
The following example shows /kan/ with an unmarked imperfective 
signalling past habitual action:

Egyptian shows more restricted use of marked imperfective forms 
in temporal compound phrases than do Moroccan and Syrian. Cairene 
speakers allow indicative forms only with /kan/:

Other temporal verbs normally embed unmarked imperfectives or, in

7.2.2 Topicalization of Temporal Verbż 
In some sentences containing /kan/ to be, the syntactic position 
of this verb is difficult to determine. In these cases, /kan/ seems to 
occupy a syntactic sentence position only tenuously related to the 
remainder of the main clause. 
At times, the subject agreement of /kan! differs from that of the 
temporally embedded verb in any obvious way. In the following, the 
syntactic subject of /kanit/ she was refers back to the topic of the 
previous sentence, the /masta/ woman who dresses brides for weddings, 
3"Topic" as a sentence category is treated at length in Chapter 10.

and is co-referential with the direct object /yaha/ her, not the subject of

This "dressing woman" [was] a woman who used to work in the 
bathhouse. In the old days they used to bring her to her [the 
bride] to henna her legs/or her 
In order to make syntactic sense of this sentence, it is necessary 
to posit a sentence category that /Un/ can occupy. This position cannot 
be called auxiliary, because of the discrepancy between the subjects of 
/kant and the subjects of the main verbs in the example cited above. 
The syntactic role of /kant in such sentences may be better analyzed as 
thematic or topical. The facts that support this analysis include: (a) in 
these sentences, /kant always occupies sentence-initial position, and (b) 
the subject pronoun of /kant in such cases is not coreferent with the 
main-clause subject. All four dialects all exhibit this use of /kant. 
In this Kuwaiti sentence, the relationship of /kant to the rest of 
the sentence is difficult to explain structurally, since /kan 'anal it was I 
is ungrammatical. Here, /kan 'awwal/ it was in the old days sets the 
temporal frame for the rest of the passage:

which I-do every thing 
It was in the old days here I who cooked, I who raised the kids 
and I who did everything 
While it could be argued that the entire sentence is the syntactic subject 
of /Un/, this analysis does not satisfactorily explain other examples. 

7.2 Temporal Verbs 
219 
The subject of /krm/ it was in the next sentence is not coreferent with 
either the subject of /t}atgi-li/ going to come to me, or any other sentence 
constituent. Here /kan/ can only be understood as establishing past 
time reference outside the clausal boundaries of the rest of the sentence.

The next Syrian sentence shows similar structure. In Arabic syntax, 
the main negating particles normally precede the initial verb, but in this 
sentence, /kan/ it was precedes the negative /mii/:

This sentence does not represent an isolated instance of such a 
construction, for Woidich lists similar Egyptian examples (1968:41). 
Often /kan/ will frame an embedded negative verb phrase to give a 
habitual reading, which may be related to the topical position of /kanJ, 
In the following passage, the second occurrence of /kiin/ it was 
does not agree with the embedded verb /kaysRyybuh/ they throw it out. 
The most likely referent is the discourse topic, /l-l:tut/ the fish. 4

The [fish] that has rag-like fins, [no one] valued it, they just 
threw it out 
Syrian /ar/ can also be topicalized. In the following passage, 
the subject of /ar/ is unclear, but it would be difficult to assign that 
role to /il-(alam/ because the following verb, /it(awwdu/, shows that 
4Another problematic use of !kanl in this sentence is that the singular subject 
of Ima kan§ kaya'tihl he didn't use to give it has no clear referent, unless an 
elided one is postulated. 

220 
Tellse alld Time Referellce 
1iI-(alam/ is plural in this context. 
Moreover, the perfective verb 
/it(awwdu/ they became accustomed to cannot belong to the same clause 
as /gar/, which does not embed a perfective verb:

became-it a-little the-world got-accustomed-they that they-see two 
walking-p with each-other 
People have gotten a bit used to seeing two people going together 
Similarly, in the following, /gar/ has no subject, since the main verb 
/mma yitqaddmu/ they are progressing shows a plural subject: 
S2

halla' ya(ni gar Twayye Twayye mma yitqaddmu 
now that-is became-it little little prog they-progress

It is difficult to translate the next two examples in a way that 
reflects their structure. The verb /gar/ to become occurs three times, 
and in no case does it agree with the syntactic subject of its sentence. 
Rather. all three verbs agree syntactically with their topics: in the first 
sentence, /garit/ refers to a hypothetical girl while /gar/ has no clear 
syntactic referent; in the second example, /bigIr/ he becomes refers to 
the hypothetical deceased:

Kuwaiti /gam/ to begin, a semantic equivalent to Syrian /War/, can 
be topicalized as well. In most Arabic dialects (as in formal Arabic), 
questions are formed by fronting the interrogative particle. Thus in the 
following, interrogative f*,/ what precedes the verb /tsawwi/ she does. 
However, the sentence-initial /gamat/ she began falls outside these 
normal syntactic parameters, preceding the interrogative: 
K3 
r-=J ,j৯ I.![ r¬ JS 'I.!੝ u:. ଍IS 
gamat ; tsawwi, kil yom ti;tiri fxug lal}am 
began-she what she-does, every day she-buys legs of-meat 
She began to do what? every day she [would] buy legs of meat 
Numerous cases exist in which /Un/, Syrian /War/, and Kuwaiti 
/gam/ exhibit an unusual relationship to the sentence they modify. It 
will be argued in Chapter 10 that the sentence position these verbs 
occupy may be defined as a topic position. Other temporal verbs, 
meaning to start/begin and to cease/no longer [do] show interesting 
cross-dialectal parallels, as the next sections demonstrate. 
7.2.3 To start, begin: Stative and Non-stative 
Most dialects have two sets of verbs that indicate the onset or 
inception of a state or action with a following imperfective, one group 
whose literal meaning is to become, and another whose meaning is to 
begin. The former set tends to place semantic focus on the change of 
state or habit, including motion, while the latter signals the onset of an 
activity. The following pairs demonstrate the use of these verbs. 
The first Moroccan example shows /da'/ to become with a verb 
of motion, emphasizing the state of rushing about, while the second 
contains /nac}./ to begin, indicating what the woman started doing next: 
M2

Examples contrasting Egyptian /ba'a/ to become and /ibtada/ to 
begin include the following. In the first, /ba'et/ I became signals entry 
into a state of confinement, while in the second, /ibtadat/ it began 
indicates the onset of melting (Badawi and Hinds 1 986:91 , 59):

The Syrian ice-cream joke (cited in full in 1 .5) contains both /War/ to 
become and /balla§/ to begin. The former emphasizes a change of 
expected state, namely, the unexpectedness of eating ice cream with 
bread, while the latter notes the ensuing action of the waiter:

My Kuwaiti corpus includes only /gam/ to get up, begin for both 
changes of state and the onset of activity (but see AI-Najjar for composed 
sentences containing /bida/ to begin, 1 984:30-32). From my data:

More importantly, the eastern dialects in particular show that Ima 
'adl is losing its status as independent' verb, perhaps on its way to 
becoming a frozen particle. In third-person contexts, Ima 'adl no longer 
shows agreement with plural subjects, as may be seen in the following, 
in which Ima 'adl is dependent on lyiSa"lul they turn on for subject 
agreement.

partial. A Beiruti informant claims that first and second person subjects 
require subject agreement, and even in the third person, Ima 'adl retains 
full agreement with its subject if it does not temporally embed another

7.3 The Participle and Time Reference 
Analyses of the role of the active participle in the verbal system 
of spoken Arabic have been troubled by meanings that appear at first to 
be contradictory: the participle is used in sentences that have past, 
present, present perfect and future time reference. Harrell says of the 
active participle in Moroccan that it "functions as a verb in the sense 
that it takes objects and indicates various degrees of time and manner 
of verbal action" (1962: 1 73, emphasis mine). 
In all four dialects investigated here, the active participle is 
commonly used in past, present and future time contexts. As Eisele 
notes for Egyptian, logical analysis of the time reference of the participle 
shows that the participle has no time reference, and that the time reference 
is supplied by the context, as is the case with non-present uses of the 
imperfective verb ( 1990a:206). The time reference of the resultant 
state expressed by the participle may be indicated in several ways. 
The fact that the participle itself has no time reference of its own 
is demonstrated by the fact that adverbs of all different time frames 
correlate with it. Eisele has determined that the collocation of various 
time adverbials with the participle in Cairene Arabic may be explained 
by the association of the adverbials with the underlying (perfective) 
event implied by the participle (1990a:204-6). The same analysis applies 
to the other dialects as well, for all of them allow reference to be made 
to the implied event underlying the participle. In the following sentences, 
adverbs ˉl;1al hadi/ for a long time, /imbaril;1/ yesterday, and /min zaman! 
for a long time all correlate with the perfective events assumed and 
subsumed by the participles:

Moreover, when the resultative state of the participle is not relevant 
to the moment of speech, past time reference must be specified by 
/kan/, as these examples show:

In contexts whose past time reference has been established, the 
participle can even express pluperfect time reference. The immediately 
preceding Egyptian example is translated had never imagined (rather 
than didn't imagine) according to its context, the narration of a past 
event. My corpus contains many examples of pluperfect time reference:

The problem of future time reference may be solved in the same 
way, if, instead of restricting the 'present relevance' of the perfect to a 
'past event,' the perfect is defined as having present relevance to an 
event past or future. Since the participle itself carries no specific time 
reference, the event implied by the participle may be either past or 
future, correlating respectively with past or future adverbs and other 
time referents. In the following examples, the adverbs /bukra/ and 
/g?dda/ tomorrow refer to the future time of the perfective event of 
setting off or leaving, and obviously not to the duration of the trip. 
E5

Both of these examples may also be translated as ... will have left. In 
all dialects, certain participles of motion commonly refer to future 
actions such as leaving, coming, and going. 

228 
Tense and Time Reference 
The use of non-motion participles to refer to the future appears 
to be limited to contexts of swearing an oath, and in particular negative 
oaths, as the following examples suggest. These participial oaths 
emphasize that the event to which they refer will not take place under 
any circumstance, strongly negating any possible resultant state from 
such an occurrence. It is in part the speech act itself, the act of swearing, 
that gives rise to the future interpretation of these sentences.s

The next Kuwaiti example confirms that participles of motion can be 
used in oaths as well: 
SThis function of the participle in spoken Arabic parallels the use of the 
perfective in Classical Arabic to deny the occurrence of an event in the future 
(see Wright 1898ii:2).

The participle thus constitutes an aspectual verb form that 
represents a resultant state of a perfective action or event. As Eisele 
( 1990a) suggests, the implied event can be a past or a future one, and 
thus the resultant state can refer to past, present, or future time relative 
to the moment of speaking. This time reference, however, is established 
through the use of adverbs or contextual meaning. 
7.4 Summary 
While Chapter 6 described the aspectual content of the Arabic 
morphological verb forms, the perfective, the imperfective, and the 
participle (perfect), this chapter has explored their role in establishing 
time reference. Comrie's (1976) assessment of Classical Arabic verb 
forms as representing relative past and relative non-past applies equally 
to the verb system of spoken Arabic. The relative nature of time 
reference in Arabic manifests itself in a number of ways. 
Time reference in Arabic is inherently relative to the moment of 
utterance, so much so that "present tense" requires no verb form at all. 
Verbless copulative ("equational") sentences rely on the moment of 
speech to temporally frame their propositions. 
However, while the most basic reference point for time reference 
is the moment of speech, that point may be fairly easily shifted by 
means of temporal sentence elements, such as adverbs, or by the larger 
discourse context. Two mechanisms play a role in shifting relative 
time reference from the moment of speaking to another point, past or 
future: syntactic embedding, which shifts the temporal reference point 
to the main clause, and tense neutralization, a discourse mechanism by 
which a single past time reference may set the narrative frame for an 
entire passage. These two mechanisms allow aspect to play a greater 
role than time reference in the choice of verb form in many contexts. 

230 
Tense and Time Reference 
A special class of verbs called here temporal verbs maintain as 
their primary function the establishment of time reference, especially 
of non-punctual events and states. These verbs embed other verbs 
temporally, but not modally (see also 5.2.2). Temporal verbs exhibit 
striking parallels across all four dialect regions. Finally, the participle 
itself carries no tense or time reference; rather, its time reference is 
established through relative tense, speech contexts (especially swearing 
oaths), adverbs, and temporal verbs. 

8 MOOD 
8.0 
Introduction 
Palmer defines modality as "the grammaticalization of speakers' 
(subjective) attitudes and opinions" (1986: 1 6), in other words, the 
speaker's characterization of the event as possible, desirable, necessary, 
and so forth.! 
However, while modality refers to a feature often. 
marked on the verb, it "does not relate semantically to the verb alone 
or primarily, but to the whole sentence" (Palmer 1986:2). In Arabic, as 
in other languages, mood can be expressed through a number of different 
means, lexical, morphological, and syntactic. Mitchell and EI-Hassan 
( 1994) note a number of sentence elements other than the verb that 
affect the interpretation of modality in educated spoken Arabic. They 
provide an extensive study of mood in the educated spoken Arabic of 
Egypt and the Levant, in which they explore the full range of means 
through which modality is expressed. What follows here falls far short 
of such an enterprise; I aim to compare the basic grammatical functions 
of the imperfective with its various markers across dialect regions. 
Excluded from this discussion are lexical mood markers such as /Uizim/ 
must, /yimkin/ may, and so on, which Mitchell and EI-Hassan examine 
at length. These lexical items contribute to the mood of a sentence by 
indicating the specific attitude of the speaker, that is, whether he or she 
presents the event as possible, desirable, necessary, and so forth. What 
is of concern here is the modal contribution of the morphological form 
of the verb itself, to the extent that it can be disengaged from lexical 
mood markers and other sentence elements. 
(Mood in formal Arabic consists of three forms of the imperfective, called 
indicative, SUbjunctive, and jussive. In general, the unmarked imperfective in 
spoken Arabic combines the functions of the Classical subjunctive and jussive 
forms (Mitchell and EI-Hassan use the term jussive for the unmarked 
imperfective in their study of mood in educated spoken Arabic, 1994:12-13). 
Cowell calls the subjunctive and jussive of Classical Arabic "not full-fledged 
grammatical categories, but only automatic syntactic alternates" (1964:343). 
That is, in formal Arabic, the choice of mood is often determined by one of 
several negative, conditional, or nominalizing particles, and not by speaker 
attitude. Hence, the analysis presented here is an attempt to classify moods of 
spoken Arabic without reference to formal Arabic. 
231 

232 
Mood 
The number and type of moods that are expressed morphologically 
(marked on the verb itself) vary from dialect to dialect in the four areas 
under study here. The imperative has its own morphological inflectional 
stem, consistent in all dialects. Moroccan, Egyptian, and Syrian all 
distinguish between the indicative mood, which represents an actual 
event, and the subjunctive, which indicates a potential event. Kuwaiti 
makes no such grammatical distinction, although it does have a particle 
leanl that can indicate non-actuality when used with the imperfective 
(see 8.5). 
Table 8- 1 summarizes these and other moods, using 
terminology adapted from Palmer ( 1986) and Mitchell and EI-Hassan 
( 1994).

Also included here is a brief discussion of the marked forms of 
the imperfective that indicate future time reference. Grammarians of 
Levantine Arabic in particular decline to classify these markers as 

8.1 Marked and Unmarked lmperfectives 
233 
future because of the tense implications of that term (see Cowell 
1964:322; Mitchell and El-Hassan 1994: 1 3). But according to Lyons, 
"[fJuturity is never a purely temporal concept" (1977:677), and Bybee, 
Perkins, and Pagliuca note that, cross-linguistically, "future is less a 
temporal category and more a category resembling agent-oriented and 
epistemic modality, with important temporal implications" ( 1994:280). 
Palmer cites a number of languages in which the future has a modal 
sense, and modals are used to indicate future events (1986:217-8).2 I 
will thus use the term future to refer to a grammatical mood rather than 
a morphological tense, since Arabic marks the future in the same way 
it marks other moods. 
Mitchell and El-Hassan classify the mood of the perfective as 
indicative (1994: 14), and its unmarked usage is so, but the perfective 
also has a non-indicative marked use in oaths (in modal terms, 
commissives, Palmer 1986: 1 15) and conditionals, which will be examined 
in the final sections of this chapter. 
8.1 
Marked and Unmarked Imperfectives 
Moroccan, Egyptian, and Syrian speakers distinguish between 
marked and unmarked imperfective forms (Table 8-2 lists the main 
imperfective markers found in the four dialect areas). Marked forms of 
the imperfective represent indicative and future moods. 
The 
morphologically unmarked form of the imperfective serves as a 
subjunctive mood, with non-indicative, potential, hortative, or optative 
meaning, and also functions as a subordinate, non-finite verb. In addition, 
the subjunctive in Moroccan and Egyptian can express polite questions, 
possibility, and desirability, similar to English modals would, should, 
could, and might. The marked imperfective, or indicative, contrasts 
with the unmarked imperfective, or subjunctive, in both syntactic 
distribution and modal function. 
Syntactically, the unmarked imperfective functions as a non-finite 
verb in subordinate clauses in all three dialects; the marked imperfective 
may not assume this function. The following pairs of Moroccan and 
Egyptian examples contrast grammatical sentences with embedded 
20ne such future modal is the imperfective inflection of the energetic mood 
of Classical Arabic, which generally refers to future actions (Wright 1898ii:24).

The two Moroccan forms' reflect northern and southern usage respectively. 
Indicative forms in parentheses represent progressive markers; Kuwaiti /ga'id/ 
(masculine) has feminine and plural forms /ga'da/ and ga'din/ (see 8.3.2). 
Kuwaiti /tan/ carries special modal meaning (see 8.5). Other local variants 
of these particles exist alongside the forms given here. 
Moroccan data 
containing future particle /'a-/ in place of ImaM was recorded in the town of 
Larache along the Atlantic coast, and future /'a/ is also found in rural Egypt 
(Behnstedt and Woidich 1985ii:224). Behnstedt and Woidich note indicative 
/'a/, /'am/ and variants in some rural Egyptian areas (1985ii:221). Many 
Syrian speakers add Ib-/ to progressive prefix /'am/, resulting in flam b-/. 
Variant /mma/ for /,am/ occurs in some of my northern Syrian data.

go out, /nishar/ we stay up at night, /nfOt/ we go, in /nidrus/ we study, 
/nitma;;a/ we go walking, and /nrut)./ we go are all subordinate to 
/bt).ibb/ I like. Marked imperfectives ("/bni­la'/ we go out, "/bnishar/ we 
stay up, and so on) would be ungrammatical this context.

The modal distinction grammaticalized by the marked/indicative 
and unmarked/subjunctive forms of the imperfective aspect corresponds 
to the distinction between actual and potential. Mitchell and EI-Hassan 
note that "the subjunctive indicates unrealized verbal action" (1994:29). 
I prefer the term potentiality: the subjunctive represents a potential 
event without reference-or speaker commitment-to actualization. The 
following minimal pairs demonstrate the actual and potential modal 
distinction as grammaticalized by unmarked and marked forms of the 
imperfective in Egyptian. Column (a) contains unmarked imperfectives,

236 
Mood 
Each of the dialects marks the imperfective with different modal 
prefixes, and it is here that these dialects show the greatest individuality. 
However, differences in the prefixes themselves do not always parallel 
differences in usage. Egyptian and Moroccan dialects share the same 
basic system of marked and unmarked imperfectives, even though the 
prefixes they use derive from different lexical sources. And Egyptian 
and Syrian share the indicative marker /b(i)-/, but while a number of its 
functions overlap, others differ. Syrian stands out among these three 
dialects in having the most complex system of imperfective markers. 
The discussion will begin with a comparison of the unmarked 
imperfective in Moroccan, Egyptian, and Syrian dialects, followed by a 
comparison of the marked forms, with special attention to Syrian /b-/. 
8.2 
Unmarked Imperfective: Subjunctive 
In addition to its grammatical role as a non-finite, embedded 
verb form, the SUbjunctive may express hortative and optative moods, 
or it may function as a kind of potential deontic mood,3 that is, it 
suggests the possibility, necessity, or desirabilit/ of performing an 
action. In Moroccan and Egyptian, the subjunctive plays a number of 
roles as a main clause verb, appearing in main clauses expressing event­
as-potentiality, and reflecting a non-assertive stance on the part of the 
speaker. It often expresses a degree of politeness in social interaction. 
Contrast the subjunctive in the Moroccan and Egyptian version with 
the indicative in the Syrian version of Would you [like toJ drink some

Mitchell and El-Hassan point out that Egyptians, in contrast to 
Levantine speakers, typically omit /bi-/ from the imperfective of certain 
verbs of knowing, remembering, liking, and other "mental" verbs 
3Deontic is used here, following Palmer (1986:96), to refer to moods involving 
human will, such as obligation, permission, and necessity. 
4Mitchell and El-Hassan propose the term desiderative for these exhortatory 
meanings (1994:29), but desiderative is used by other linguists to mean an 
unrealizable wish: would that . . .  (Palmer 1986: 10). 

8.2 Unmarked Imperfective: Subjunctive 
237 
( 1994:22-3). Presumably, the polite speaker does not want to commit 
too much to the truth of opinions or presume to know the mind of 
another person. In the following, the absence of /bi-/ may reflect the 
speaker's doubt that her listener knows her: 
E6 
\,..:..;Ǥ d::.Ȕ ..:;..:.1 ,$ ..:.JL.:i 
'alit-Iu, 'inta J:ta<,tritak ti'rafni? 
said-she-to-him, you sir you-know-me? 
She said to him, you, sir, Do you know me? 
Syrian speakers, in contrast, tend to use /b-/ imperfectives with 
verbs of thinking and knowing (example from Cowell 1 964:483; see 
also Mitchell and EI-Hassan 1994:23): 
S 
'lFL... G H I B "";J 
bta'rif-li ;i bint bti"od Òlln'a ? 
[indic-you-know-for-me some girl indic-she-sits maid] 
Do you know any girl who would work as a maid? 
Moroccan patterns appear to follow Egyptian ones. Here a speaker 
uses the subjunctive /ta'q;}li/ you remember: 
M5 
B ɮ .".ul EöI d.:!J .>I ৣ - E÷ '!Ǜ .:,.. J?I 
'uww;}l m;}rra tan;ri zllllba -- ta'q;}li 'uxti, dik ;}z-zllllba lli ;riti-li

dress reI bought-you for-us 
[It was J the first time I bought a jel/aba [type of dress J-remember, 
sister, that jel/aba you bought me? 
Mitchell and EI-Hassan claim that subjunctive "refers to a formal 
subjoining of sentence elements" (1994: 13), and this appears to be true 
in general for some of the Levantine dialects. According to Mitchell 
and EI-Hassan as well as Beiruti informants, Levantine speakers use 
the indicative marker /b-/ in polite requests, for possibility, or a deontic 
modal meaning might, could, would ( 1994:20ft).5 Cowell, on the other 
SMitchell and EI-Hassan note the following exception in their data from 
Lebanon (1994:32): 
L

to it suggestivity (1964:344): 
S 
 <:,w, 6 J • iJ-f-i J,..c I 
'a'mel 'ahwe, wlla Tay? 
[I-make coffee, or tea?] 
Shall I make coffee, or tea? 
This use of the unmarked imperfective is rejected by my Beiruti 
informants, who insist on the /b-/ imperfective here. The conflicting 
data and judgements of various Syro-Levantine grammars and speakers 
remain unsolvable at this juncture, and suggest dialect variation and 
possibly syntactic change in progress. The wider modal range of Syrian 
/b-/ as compared to Egyptian /bi-/ invites further analysis; this topic 
will be revisited in 8.4. 
In all three dialects, the definiteness or individuation of a verb's 
subject or topic may affect its modal marking. Cowell observes that 
the subjunctive often appears in clauses modifying an indefinite head 
noun (1964:356; cf. Mitchell and EI-Hassan 1994:42). In such cases, 
the non-specific reference of the indefinite noun may "attract" the 
sUbjunctive as an expression of lack of speaker commitment to an 
actual event or state of affairs. In the following, the Syrian speaker 
mentions /bint/ a girl who /ma tkOn/ might not be (subjunctive) a 
virgin, a potential rather than an actual case: 
S2 
.IJ¥ iJ¦ La # ௒l:! >I J.:.i.= :IJ L:.< #ઈ J.!, i,,·

'azra' 
impossible here at-us one he-accept that-he he-take girl neg she-be 
virgin 
It's impossible here for anyone to agree to marry a girl who 
isn't/might not be a virgin 
Moroccan data also suggest a tendency for unindividuated nouns 
to occur with subjunctive verbs. One of Harrell's Moroccan texts contains 
two examples parallel in structure, but containing different moods. In 
the first, a negated subjunctive /ma t'a!bk-Ti/ you might not like 
modifies a partly specified /Ti J:ta!a/ something. In the second, indicative 
/kat'arfu/ you know modifies lsi J:tadd/ someone, an indefinite-specific

Know that someone you know died and you will get news of this 
Another factor may also affect the speaker's choice of verb mood here: 
the negated verb in the first example, /ma t(dbek-W you might not 
like. Since a negated verb does not represent an expected action, there 
is little need for speaker commitment to the actuality of the event. In 
fact, the use of indicative forms in negative clauses should reflect a 
strong speaker commitment to the non-actuality of the event or state. 
Section 6.5 has shown that speakers of all four dialects often 
choose the imperfective to represent non-punctual past events in 
narrative. While this usage of the imperfective usually entails indicative 
forms, the subjunctive is occasionally used. In describing habitual 
events, speakers may use the unmarked imperfective to give a non­
indicative reading. In the next example, an elderly Moroccan speaker 
addicted to sniffing tobacco uses unmarked imperfective forms /nÁbqa/ 
I remain, /nWib/ I find, /nl}ibb/ I want, and /nqul/ I say, to describe 
events that occur repeatedly, whenever she tries to give up the habit:

In the next Syrian passage, an Aleppan speaker describes her experience 
with her American neighbors while living in the U.S. for a year. Here, 
the unmarked imperfectives /ykOnu/ they would be, /ydi"u/ they would 
knock, and /y'OIO-li/ they say to me give modal, past habitual readings:

I'm telling you, they would be walking their dogs, they would be 
strolling in the street, they'd knock on my door and say to me, Do 
you mind if we have some coffee? 
One usage of the unmarked imperfective seems to be distinctively 
Moroccan. Harrell observes that Moroccan speakers use the unmarked 
imperfective as an immediate future, as well as a future in the apodosis 
of conditional clauses (1962: 173-5). His observation is born out in the 
following excerpt from a Moroccan folktale, in which the highlighted 
unmarked imperfective /ndirha/ I do it clearly refers to a future action: 
Mi l 
'!LA . l+-!  LAJlw " J.:.:i J4-ੳ7 4=o)J .}J1 U I  ୴ ¹JLA

That is Shiha Bhiha who does it to men before they can do it to 
her. Ho ho ho, [just wait] 'til l do it to her, I [will] do it to her! 
Here, as well as in some of Harrell's examples, there seems to be more 
intentional commitment to acts expressed with an unmarked imperfective. 

8.3 Marked Forms of the Imperfective 
241 
Perhaps the omission of an indicative or future marker represents a 
deontic expression of speaker intention, as contrasted to an epistemic 
expression of the speaker's commitment to the actuality of the event. 
8.3 
Marked Forms of the Imperfective 
This section will briefly treat the moods of the various marked 
imperfectives. The main focus here will be on Syrian, since it has the 
most complex system of imperfective marking, with particular attention 
paid to the functions of Syrian verbal prefix /b-/. Kuwaiti, on the ?ther­
hand, will receive less attention, because its modal system does not 
make extensive use of verbal prefixes. 
8.3.1 Future and Intentive Moods 
Table 8-2 (section 8. 1) reveals a partial overlap across adjacent 
dialect areas in the case of particles /b(i)-/ and frat)!. Syrian and Kuwaiti 
share the particle /b(i)-/ as an intentive future, while Egyptian, Syrian, 
and urban Kuwaiti share the particle frat)! (Egyptian /t).a-/). The existence 
in Syrian and Kuwaiti of two future particles, /b-/ and /ral)./, necessitates 
a distinction between future and intentive moods. The western dialects, 
on the other hand, have only one future marker each, with regional 
variants. 
The most common future particle in Moroccan is /ˑ}i(di)/, my 
data include regional variants /(a-/ and /ma§/ in the area surrounding 
Tangiers and Tetouan. 
MIO t.:.ļ" t.:.'-:!j.a '-:!T J .dJ JÅ t u!.

I will put out my leg from the window for you 

242 
Mood 
In Egypt, most speakers use the particle IQ.a-/ (less frequently 
fha-/) to signify future reference: 
E l  ď l1 Đ Jt.:... đ6. 
J:ta-xalli manal tigibu lamma tigi 
fut-I-make Manal she-bring-it when she-come 
I'll have Manal get it when she comes 
The derivations of these future particles help shed light on their 
modal meanings. While Moroccan and Egyptian future particles derive 
from lexical variants of the verb to go, the Kuwaiti future marker /b-/ 
has its origin in the imperfective stem /(y)abi/ (he) wants, as the use of 
the full form shows (see also AI-Najjar 1984:87-90): 
K3 
·Ja., 
."..--: ଃ 
yabi yŌRggni 
he-wants he-beats-me 
He {was] about to beat me 
Kuwaiti /b-/ appears to indicate both future time reference and 
intentionality (AI-Najjar calls it "volition," 1984: 1 19), at least in the 
speech of an older Kuwaiti woman. In the first of the next pair, both 
taken from an interview with an elderly woman, /biydiJJ/ he will enter 
must signal future time reference, since one cannot exercise control 
over one's age. In contrast, /biytaŌallagOn/ they want to get divorced in 
the second clearly indicates the intention of the participants to get 
divorced: 
K3

raJ:taw l-maJ:tkama biytaŌallagOn 
went-they the-court will-they-get-divorced 
They went to the court wanting to get divorced 
A young Kuwaiti male, on the other hand, uses both /b-/ and 
/raJ:t/, the former in contexts reflecting a degree of personal will or 
intention, and the second as a future marker: In the first of the two 

8.3 Marked Forms of the Imperfective 
243 
examples taken from his narrative about a trip to Morocco, the speaker 
uses /b-/ to indicate the intention of his friends for the group to go to 
Egypt: 
Kl 
׳ C:Jx (:.1 `J.J.C.J 
wa<adOni inna bi-miJ:t maWar 
promised-they-me comp-we b-we-go Egypt 
They promised me that we will go to Egypt 
When the promise falls through, they encourage him to go visit Morocco, 
and the future particle /raI:t/ marks what will happen if he does: 
Kl 
L. ".J .#j ". .:J4J c)J1 7I ".J ·u8 C:j Eø .I C:Jj

go Morocco, experience fut it-be, if the-person with-you neg

traveling 
Go to Morocco, it will be an experience, if the person you're with 
isn't good, if you don't know him well, you will get to know him 
in traveling 
The intentive nature of Kuwaiti /b-/ is not limited to human will. In 
the following, the subject of /biƔir/ will happen is /mˊayib/ catastrophes, 
as if problems will single out the speaker: 
Kl 
!4 úL-..   ଁ ୮.୯ JJI jLA 
haˋi 'awwal muWiba <ayal biƔir-li maWayib bi-l-magrib 
this first catastrophe then b-3fs-happen-to-me catastrophes in 
Morocco 
This is the first catastrophe, then [more J catastrophes will happen 
to me in Morocco! 
Syrian speakers also have at their disposal the same two 
functionally distinct particles that refer to future events, /b-/ and /raI:t/. 
Cowell names /raJ:t1 a "particle of anticipation," and classifies the future 
meaning of /b-/, which he describes as either "annunciatory" or 
"dispositional," as a subcategory of the indicative ( 1964:322-27). 
Mitchell and EI-Hassan subsume under "nonpast tense" both the 

244 
Mood 
"intentive" mood marked by ̻a/ and the "indicative" marked by /b-/ 
(1994: 14), and note that, H[iJn the Levant especially, b-nonpast is often 
of straightforward future reference" (1994: 1 3). Both of these studies 
thus include the future meaning of /b-/ as a subclass of the indicative 
mood. I will argue that a distinction should be maintained between the 
two meanings, and suggest separate origins for intentive /b-/ and 
indicative /b-/ in 8.4. 
Both /b-/ and /rat)./ indicate future actions and events in Syrian, 
but each one has a distinct modal implication. The following four 
examples all occur in the Syrian play Wadi al-Misk:

Two significant differences in context emerge between the first two 
sentences, which contain /rat)./, and the latter two, with /b-/. First, /rat)./ 
is used with questions that specifically ask about future events: naming 
a child and seeking a pay raise, while /b-/ appears in statements about 
intended actions on the part of the speaker. (The fact that the /b-/ 
future often occurs on first-person verbs lends further support to the 
intentive reading of this particle.) Second, the first two examples with 
/rat)./ consist of questions seeking information. In the judgement of a 

8.3 Marked Forms o/the Imperfective 
245 
Lebanese infonnant, Ib-/ cannot be used to seek factual infonnation, 
such as what or where, about a future event; he rejects the following as 
ungrammatical: 
L 
 da.. ',,,!? -,: D .. 
.. ;u bitzlb ma(ak? 
.. what int-you-bring with-you 
.. What will you bring with you? 
However, Ib-/ may be used in infonnational questions if the question 
focuses on the addressee's intention:

- I 
OM 
_£ أ 
imta b?tzld Ina l-ma(a;? 
when int-you-increase for-us the-salary 
When do you plan to raise our salary? (elicited) 
The Levantine modal use of Ib-/ in polite questions-a usage not 
shared by Egyptian speakers-further supports its interpretation as an 
intentive particle expressing will: 
L

int-you-drink tea? 
Would you like to drink some tea? (elicited) 
Another special use of Syrian Ib-/ combines it with a negative 
particle to express a commissive mood, a commitment on the part of 
the speaker that an event will not, or must not happen, In this case Ib-/ 
gives a future modal meaning to the verb, The following two passages, 
taken from the same text, show modal future uses of Ib-/ in /ma btiftal)ha/ 
you must not open it and /ma biWIr/, which commonly carries the meaning 
it must not be, [one] must not ...

This and other meanings of Syrian /b-I will be discussed further in 8.4. 
8.3.2 Indicative Mood 
The indicative mood represents action as realized process, 
depending on the lexical aspect of the verb, habitual, progressive, or 
stative. Table 8-3 lists the indicative prefixes in the dialects.

Moroccan Ika-I and Ita-I, Egyptian Ibi-I, and Syrian Ib-I 
(disregarding its intentive meaning) all share the meaning of action-as­
state-of being, or a combined habitual/stative aktionsart.6 Harrell calls 
Moroccan /kal the durative, a term that neatly combines the habitual 
and the stative meanings, leaving the interpretation of specific examples 
to the lexical aspect of the verb and other sentential and discourse 
factors (section 6. 1 shows that stative and progressive readings depend 
6Comrie defines habituality to include non-iterative acts, such as used to 
believe (1976:27, but see Mitchell and EI-Hassan for arguments against this 
analysis, 1994: 100-1).

Moroccan and Egyptian data include:

You see , Uncle Ahmad plays the lute 
The western dialects, Moroccan and Egyptian, do not 
grammatically distnguish between indicative and progressive moods, 
using their indicative markers for both. Syrian and Kuwaiti, on the 
other hand, mark progressivity with other particles. 
The progressive prefix in urban Syria is I'am/, followed by the 
imperfective with or without the /b-I prefix: 
S5 
! Ȓ ৡ 
'am ba'il-lik! 
prog indic-I-say to-you! 
I'm telling you! 
Some northern Syrian speakers use Immal as a variant of I'aml 
(presumably reflexes of /'ammal!, intact in Egyptian as an intensifier): 
S2 
ȑ L. Jl£ l. . I© La .:.%I #&L. '

Nowadays girls have come to ignore [social pressure}, it no

Egyptian speakers have at their disposal an intensifying progressive 
/'ammal! (Badawi and Hinds 1986:602): 
E 
'L JL-
E 
cammal yakul 
continuous he-eat 
He keeps on eating 

248 
Mood 
Kuwaiti speakers, who have no indicative marker, use /ga'id/ (f 
/ga'da/, p /ga'dinl) to mark the progressive. From my Kuwaiti data: 
K l  
৙.J '-:'୫ c lS  ૽ / 1 vJ 
rifiji iii yam[b Ji ga'id ygrab wiski 
friend-my rei beside-me prog he-drinks whiskey 
My friend who is next to me is drinking whiskey 
AI-Najjar's examples show subject agreement in all cases, among them 
the feminine /ga'da/ here ( 1984:212): 
K 
rl:!'iLA ୪ u!od .clS Ŷj-A 
maryam ga'da tafriT beytha ha l-ayyam 
Maryam prog-f she-furnishes house-her this the-days 
Maryam is furnishing her house these days 
Syrian and Kuwaiti thus grammaticalize the progressive, while 
Moroccan and Egyptian do not. 
8.4 
The Multiple Meanings of Syrian /b-/ 
Syrian /b-/ presents a puzzle. Although lexically identical to the 
Egyptian fbi-I, its syntactic range is broader than its Egyptian counterpart. 
Syrian /b-/ occurs in a number of contexts with different meanings, 
summarized in Table 8-4. Most of these functions have already been 
discussed in 8.3, except for the use of /b-/ as a modal future. 
Unlike indicative prefixes Egyptian /bi-/ and Moroccan /ka-/, 
Syrian /b-/ may occur in embedded deontic clauses. While epistemic 
embedded clauses normally contain verbs with indicative prefixes in 
Moroccan, Egyptian, and Syrian, deontic clauses cannot embed indicative 
verb forms in Moroccan and Egyptian. The following sentences contain 
epistemic clauses with indicative verb forms (in boldface): 
M3 
'iwI ..ILA Ixy z {

However, only Syrian allows a /b-/-imperfective (or, in the case 
of Moroccan, Ika-/-imperfective) to be embedded in deontic subordinate 
clauses (example from Cowell 1964:347):

Comparison of the /b-/ markers in the two preceding Syrian 
examples reveals that the first, /bya'ref/ he knows is durative (in this 
case, stative), while the second, /ma by?zi/ he's not going to come is 
intentive future with respect to the main verb, /n?froQ/ let's suppose. 
Cowell gives a similar minimal pair ( 1964:347): 
s

ungrammatical: 
E 
@ 	' "b.J " 
.. wa'adni innu biyirga' 
.. promised-he-me comp-he indic-he-returns 
II- He promised me that he is coming back

Cowell notes that "the /b-/ prefix of a verb in the imperfect[ive] 
is not dropped after the hypothetical /kan/. as it is, usually. when /kanl 
is used for past time reference" (1964:336). In the following example, 
/b-/ gives a modal sense to /Áb)al l remain; it is clear that /b-/ here

Another distinctively Syrian use of /b-/ (as contrasted with 
Egyptian /bi-I) is its cooccurrence with temporal verbs. When /b-/ 
occurs in a verb phrase headed by temporal verbs (7.2), it adds a stative 
dimension to the verb phrase. Cowell's data include two contrasting 
examples of verbs embedded by IQall/ to continue, remain, the first 
with /b-/ and the second without (1964:356, 453):

[indic-he-remains he-talk about the-events the-past]

In the first of the pair, the indicative /b-/ focuses attention on the 
stativity of the act of speaking, whereas in the second, the absence of 
/b-/ maintains focus on the temporal verb /bic;lall/ he keeps on, and the 
habituality or iterativity of the act of speaking. The first sentence 
carries an element of stativity lacking in the second. 
A Beiruti informant interprets the construction with a /b-/ 
imperfective as a circumstantial clause (/t).all), providing the following 
pair of examples that contrast marked and unmarked imperfectives 
embedded by temporal verb /War/ to become, begin. In the first, the /b-/

imperfective fbyisbaQ/ he swims focuses on the onset of a state, that of 
being able to or knowing how to swim, whereas in the second, the 
unmarked /yisbaQ/ he swim focuses on the onset of an action:

The following examples from a Moroccan interview show a similar 
distinction. The verb fbqa/ (indicative /kaybqa/) to remain, keep on is 
followed in the first example by indicative /kayh;}wwdu/ they go down 
and in the second by unmarked imperfective /yqUl! he say:

The u&e of the indicative with the perfective form /ma bqaws/ they no 
fanger go emphasizes the change of state in the same way that Levantine 
fb/ functions in the previously cited examples. In contrast, the use of 
the unmarked imperfective with /kaybqa/ he keeps on focuses on the 
habitual or iterative use of bad language. 
EI-Tonsi (personal communication) confirms that this distinction 
cannot be made in Cairene Arabic, where fbi-/ only occurs in verb 
phrases headed by /kant to be. However, he notes that it occurs in 
other regions outside Cairo, and one of Behnstedt's Alexandrian texts 
contains this pair of examples ( 1980:42; translation mine): 

8.5 Kuwaiti Iclinl: Modal Auxiliary?

E 
ŝ ,":,Ş "I ş  
'umt ani bini<;lrab bi'eni 
[got-up-I indic-I-strike with-eye-my] 
I started staring 
253 
In the first of the pair, the unmarked imperfective /yi'Ul/ he says represents 
a non-stative action, whereas the fbi-i-imperfective in the second 
constitutes a stative action. Non-Cairene /bi-/ thus appears to join 
Syrian /b-/ and Moroccan /ka-/ in adding a stative or change-of-state 
meaning not found in the unmarked imperfective. 
Syrian /b-/ thus has two loci of meaning: future (intentive and 
modal) and durative (habitual/stative). The overlapping of /b-/ particles 
across several dialect areas and semantic fields suggests the possibility 
of two different origins. The future intentive meaning corresponds 
closely to Kuwaiti /b-/, whereas the durative and habitual meanings of 
/b-/ correlate with Egyptian fbi-I. It may be that Syrian /b-/ actually 
consists of two separate morphemes, each with its own origin, and that 
the phonological overlap of these two particles was, originally, mere 
coincidence. 
8.5 
Kuwaiti Ianl: Modal Auxiliary? 
Kuwaiti /ean/ plays several roles in the mood system of this 
dialect. It combines with the perfective to produce a pluperfect, such 
as lean tNbt/ I had gotten tired (speaker K l ). At other times it occurs 
in narrative contexts indicating a kind of historical present (see 7. 1 .4). 
Elsewhere, /ean/ occurs in counterfactual conditional sentences (see 
8.8).7 This section briefly discusses the function of /ean/ as a modal 
auxiliary (approximately, would).8 
'Ingham's description of /tan/ in Najdi suggests that this particle originated 
as a conditional marker (1994:139). 
8Holes notes that Gulf speakers sometimes use the invariable /yikOn/ (3ms 
imperfective of to be) as a "periphrastic subjunctive" (1990:189). My Kuwaiti 
corpus does not have /yikOn/, but contains /kOn/ in what I interpret to be a 

254 
Mood 
In the following, the particle /·an/ in the phrase /·an ta'­ini/ 
would you give me clearly lends a modal meaning to the sentence, 
similar to the subjunctive of Egyptian and Moroccan (see 8.2): 
K4 
" '.I·,.:b·; w4 '<:'-HI . 4-I # .... l:!I $I % &' ... 
  (IJ.J L:.I )I *I.J  
... banati· kilhum 'a­ini yahum. gilt-Iaha, 'ubuy ·an ta'­ini gaW;}r

girls-your all-them imper-give-me obj-them said-I to-her dear-my 
would you-give-me palace at-you and I-come I-live I and husband­
my then? 
[She said,] "All your girls. give them to me." I told her. "Dear. 
would you give me a palace there for me to come live with my 
husband as well?" 
In his grammar of Gulf Arabic, Qafisheh translates /·an/ as would and 
provides several examples similar to the ones cited here ( 1975:226). 
However, /·an/ has a narrower semantic range than, and is 
syntactically different from, the subjunctive in other dialects, which 
may express optative and hortative moods. polite questions. and 
potentiality.9 
Of note here is that while other dialects mark the indicative form 
of the imperfective. Kuwaiti appears to be doing the opposite: developing 
a marked form for the subjunctive. In this respect the Kuwaiti verb 
system is closer to that of English. since the modal /·an/ functions 
similarly to the English modal verb "would." Superficially. Kuwaiti 
verbs bear certain affinities to Classical Arabic verbs: 
they lack 
SUbjunctive sense:

something, you should give him a sweet countenance, a tasty meal, a

9Johnstone notes that the imperfective is most common in optative sentences 
(1967: 142). 

8.6 Commissive Mood: Marked Use of Perfective 
255 
imperfective modal prefixes, and the imperfective third-person plural 
and second-person feminine singular retain final InOnI, for example: 
lygUliin/ they say, /lil txallinl don't let. However, with an imperfective 
system that does not distinguish inflectionally between actual and 
possible, Kuwaiti may be innovating in a slightly different fashion by 
developing a modal particle, I·iln/. Structurally, then, it is the Kuwaiti 
indicative and modal system that stands unique among the four dialects. 
8.6 
Commissive Mood: Marked Use of the Perfective 
While the perfective nonnally represents a completed action, in 
certain marked, negated contexts it can represent an action that has 
technically not yet taken place, and the speaker, by using the perfective. 
indicates a commitment on his or her part that it never will. Palmer 
calls this the commissive mood (1986: 1 15). This mood is more 
commonly expressed with the imperfective, except in negative oaths, 
in which the perfect or (in rare cases) the perfective may occur. In 
negative oaths, the action expressed by a perfective verb is not actually 
realized, as both speaker and audience undoubtedly know. However, 
what gives the oath its semantic and pragmatic force is precisely the 
tension between the realized and the unrealized: by expressing the 
event using a fonn nonnally reserved for realized actions, the urgency 
of the oath is clearly communicated. The following two examples 
contain commissive perfectives Imil 'idtil you no longer and /kal/ (he) 
ate respectively. 
S2 
! L:.a.. ৖ ..:. .i.£  La 
mil 'idti tiskani ma'na!

women" in Egypt (1994:3 1):

This usage appears to be limited to the speech of women (the Syrian 
speaker is a young woman from a village in northern Syria) and may

be dying out. I have found no examples of this use of the perfective in 
Moroccan or Kuwaiti.to 
8.7 
Conditional and Hypothetical Moods 
This section explores the use of two different verb stems, the 
perfective and the imperfective, in the expression of conditional modality 
in the dialects. The primary concern here is with the conditional clause, 
or protasis; rather than the apodosis, except insofar as the latter helps 
us determine the modal nature of the former. While the unmarked 
mood of the perfective is indicative, in marked usage the perfective has 
a hypothetical mood. 
Because formal Arabic stipulates the use of the perfective to 
indicate conditional mood with particles /'ig'd/ and /law/,II whereas 
most varieties of spoken Arabic permit the use of the imperfective or 
zero verb with conditional particles, it has been assumed that the 
perfective and imperfective have become more temporal and less 
aspectual, since these conditional sentences often refer to a non-past 
event (Holes 1995 : 177). However, close examination of conditional 
data reveals that speakers of most dialects choose between perfective 
and imperfective forms on the basis of modal and aspectual meanings, 
not temporal considerations. 
8.7.1 Conditional Particles in the Dialects 
Formal Arabic rules for the conditional dictate that the mood of 
the conditional as realis or irrealis is signalled through the choice of 
particle, /'iga/ for realis, /'in/ for hypothetical, and /law/ for irrealis. 
Howeͼer, spoken Arabic does not follow these patterns. Conditional 
particles as described in the grammars show a range of variation and 
overlap of meanings. Egyptian, Syrian, and Kuwaiti all allow both 
perfective and imperfective forms of the verb, as well as non-verbal 
predicates, in conditional clauses. With the possible exception of Syrian, 
Iƣhe apparent absence of the perfective as commissive in Moroccan is 
somewhat surprising, given that this dialect makes regular use of the perfective 
as a performative. as in /qbiltha/ I accept it (see also Caubet 1993ii: 1 1 1-1 14). 
IIFor a description of conditional usages in formal Arabic see Cantarino 
(1975iii:297-306, 31 1 -326) or Wright (1898ii:6-17). 

8.7 Conditional and Hypothetical Moods 
257 
the dialects do not seem to rely upon the conditional particle to make 
an absolute distinction between possible and counterfactual sentences.

four dialects.

The particle /'int, found in proverbs in a number of dialects, occurs only 
once in my data, in Kuwaiti, but Behnstedt and Woidich report its use in 
rural dialects in the Egyptian Delta (1988:26). The use of /'iza/ as a reflex 
of formal /,iga! is found in Egyptian and Syrian regions, but not in Morocco, 
where /'ila! is common, or Kuwait, where /'ila! is often elided to/la!. Educated 
Moroccan and Kuwaiti speakers commonly use /'ida! and /,iga! respectively. 
Moroccan speakers normally use the perfective in conditional 
clauses. The normal conditional particle is pIlaf: 
MI l  JI" ȏ • .l.l"JI ..:..l.l" vA "I 
'ila hiyya waldat l-wald xalliha w iiZi 'ndi 
if she bore-she the-son leave-her and come to-me 
If shegave birth to a male child, leave her and come back to me 

258 
Mood 
Particles /kun/ if (variant /kunrahl) and /liikan! if only function as irrealis 
conditional markers (Harrell 1962: 168-9, see 8.7.2.2 for examples). 
Caubet also lists the expression /'iika ... 'iika/ (heading both clauses)12 
with irrealis meaning ( 1993:206, translation mine): 
M 
! lAILa.. ƥ 4.!... lS."i ,t.:..i ..:..4- lS."i 
'iika zat 'amina, 'iika mĮina l-l-bl:tar m(aha! 
if came-she Amina, if went-we to-the-sea with-her 
If only Amina had come, we would have gone to the sea with her! 
In Cairene, /law/ appears to be synonymous with /'iza/. EI-Tonsi 
notes that conditional particles must be followed by a perfective verb, 
except in non-verbal sentences (including sentences whose predicate 
consists of a participle), or in "clauses that express an offer or proposal, 
i.e., what is in English would/could," in which the unmarked imperfective 
is often used ( 1982ii:80- 1). The imperfective examples el-Tonsi gives 
all contain stative verbs, such as following /ti'dar/ you can and /til:tibb/ 
you like: 
E 
Ȏ., ;u., ȍ Jil ljl 
'iza ti'dar tigi 'ahlan wa sahlan 
[if you-can you-come welcome] 
If you can come, you're welcome {tol

law til:tibb tigi 'ahlan wa sahlan 
[if you-like you-come welcome] 
If you'd like to come, you're welcome {to] 
However, in the following, /bitl:tibbaha/ you love her must be preceded 
by perfective /kunt/ you were, suggesting that the verb /yil:tibb/ may 
appear in the imperfective in conditionals when it means to like or to 
want, but not when it means to be in love with (example from el-Tonsi 
1982ii:82): 
E 
lAI 
.

12A Moroccan informant from Meknas prefers /'Okan/ to /Oka/. 

8.7 Conditional and Hypothetical Moods 
259 
For Syrian, clauses with /'iza/ allow the use of imperfectives 
marked with either /b-/ or /'arn! (on the use of Syrian /b-/ in conditional 
sentences see Cowell 1964:336; this is intentive future /b-/, as shown 
in 8.4). Among Cowell's examples (1964:332): 
S 
Jl.A C,Jc l,jl d.J.l.c. dL. b L. ill l..!. .:,1 
n4aHa rna fi mane' 'andak 'iza bIil} halla' 
[God-willing neg there-is objection at-you if b-I-go now 
I hope you don't mind if I go now 
According to Cowell, Syrian speakers generally reserve /law/ for use in 
irrealis conditionals, which generally take perfective verbs (1964:335). 
Kuwaiti speakers use both /10/ if, even if and /la/ if, when. However, 
while /la/ normally occurs with a perfective verb,13 /10/ often occurs 
with imperfective verbs or zero-verb, in contexts that are hypothetical 
but not necessarily irrealis:4 Even the elderly Kuwaiti speaker K3, 
who regularly uses the perfective with /la/ meaning when, uses /10/ 
with the imperfective. In the following sentence, the conditional clause 
headed by /10/ contains the imperfective /nigdar/ we are able in a 
hypothetical (not irrealis) mood, while the result clause contains the 
perfective /ganena/ we could manage, do: 
K3 
e,Jc f ,/ JA.:. .,J 
10 nigdar nsawwi 4ay ganena b-Iil}na 
if we-are-able we-do thing managed-we with-selves-our 
II we are able to do something, we could do with just ourselves 
A young male Kuwaiti likewise uses /10/ with zero-verb or imperfective 
verbs in stative conditionals, often meaning even if, as in the following: 
Kl 
C,JJI gh .,J " .,>;-... 1 L. i,J j,J kJl ' 
kil 'arba' w xamis w yim'a rna asta!gilha, 10 yomen aIil} 
every Wednesday and Thursday and Friday neg I-consider-heavy­
it, if days-2 I-go 
Every Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, I don't consider it too 
tiresome, [even] iflor two days, I go 
'Ώhe use of /la/ to mean when parallels Classical Arabic use of /'iga/, see 
Cantarino (1975iii:297), Wright (1898ii:9). 
'4Ingham's description of and data from Najdi concur (1994:137). 

260 
Mood 
In Kuwaiti, then, /10/ is more likely than /'ila/ to be followed by an 
imperfective verb. 
In three of four dialects, then, both perfective and imperfective 
stems occur in similar conditional contexts (Moroccan being the 
exception). But the use of the imperfective in conditional clauses 
(which happens even in the most "conservative" dialects, see e.g. Ingham 
for Najdi 1994: 13 1ff) has not affected the status of the perfective, and 
the verb /kfm/ to be in particular, as the primary expression of hypothetical 
mood, as the following sections will show. 
8.7.2 Hypothetical and Counterfactual /kan/ 
Palmer notes a high cross-linguistic frequency of past tense forms 
functioning modally as counterfactual (irrealis) mood markers 
(1986:210). Spoken Arabic follows this pattern as well: all four dialects 
contain reflexes of /kfm/ that mark "hypothetical distance," that is, a 
position taken by the speaker that the condition is less likely to happen, 
or is counterfactual. In fact, /kan/ has developed into a conditional 
particle in several dialects, and acquired a counterfactual or irrealis 
meaning in certain conditional contexts, as the next sections will show. 
8.7.2.1 /kan/ as Frozen Hypothetical Marker 
Cowell notes the existence in Syrian of a frozen form /kant was 
that he calls "hypothetical /kan/." Two of his examples show /kant 
functioning more as a particle than a verb, forming a syntactic unit 
with /'iza/ if(1964:334). In the second example, the impersonal subject 
of /kant does not agree with that of the following verb, na'et/ you met: 
S 
৔I .",J I.j.'J?-'! `I .",JL. wlS IaI 
'iza Un mali al)san btzibi-li l-l)akim

let-him he-drink] 
If you meet someone on the road who says to you "Give me 
water," let him drink 

8.7 Conditional and Hypothetical Moods 
261 
The following sentence shows a similar pattern. Here frozen lkanl 
does not agree in gender with the subject, feminine /l)altu/ his condition:

b-l-like that-is comp kids-two 
If I marry a rich man ... I'd like to have 4 kids,2 girls and 2 boys, 
but ifhis circumstances are modest ... I'd like to [have] 2 kids 
Ingham remarks that /kant, lin-kant, IĀant and lin-Āant all represent 
hypothetical conditional particles in Najdi ( 1994: 1 39). Some of his 
examples contain pronoun suffixes marking the logical subjects of the 
sentences, indicating that these particles have become pseudo-verbs 
(see 5.3). In the following, lin-kan-kum/ if you are contains the suffixed 
object pronoun /kuml you, which is the logical subject of the clause 
(1994: 152): 
N 
b,J l. ulS ul,J c ȦJ,J iJ(...J4 bJ k1I,J dIS ul 
৑,J ǍJ

if-kan-you ready-p put-I-you-p in-the-car and went-I-with-you-p 
and if-kan neg make ready-you-p went-I and left-I-you -p 
If you are ready I will put you in the car and take you with me 
and if you are not ready I will go on and leave you 
This frozen fonn of /kant as a hypothetical marker may be more common 
in the Najd than in Syria, however, since some of my Syrian and 
Lebanese infonnants find Cowell's thirty-odd-year-old examples strange. 
It is worth investigating the current use of frozen /kant in urban Syrian 
to compare with Cowell's examples. 
In 7.2.2, it was argued that /kant sometimes occupies a topical 
sentence position. The analysis of hypothetical /kant as a topic is also 

262 
Mood 
supported by Haiman ( 1985:34), who believes that "the protasis of a 
conditional functions more like a topic or background state of affairs 
against which the apodosis is evaluated" (cited in Croft 1990: 167). 
These frozen fonns of /kant may have developed through this process: 
the topical use of /kan! in conditionals probably helped give rise to the 
frozen fonn some Syrian and Gulf speakers use. 
8.7.2.2 Ikanl with Perfective as Counterfactual (lrrealis) Mood 
The verb /kant to be is frequently associated with counterfactual 
or irrealis mood, whether in direct or indirect conditional contexts. 
Examples from the four dialects show /kant (or Kuwaiti derivative 
lean/) in indirect (implied) unreal conditional contexts. From Moroccan 
(Harrell 1962: 185): 
M 
B r-K L ulS

Several dialects have conditional particles that are derived from 
this association between /kanJ and the irrealis mood. 
Moroccan speakers use /kfin/ or /kunrih/ (/kurah/) followed by a

indirect conditional contexts:

Feghali notes that Lebanese use /kfm/ (derived from Iykfm/, the 
imperfective of /kfiDl) in the same sense ( 1928:25; translation mine):

Kuwaiti Icanl, derived from /kan/, marks counterfactual mood in 
the apodosis of conditionals:

264 
Mood 
I, if I knew how to write and read, there would become a serial

Finally, the imperative mood in Egyptian may be embedded by 
/kanl to give a counterfactual reading:

8.7.3 Habitual and Non-hypothetical Conditionals: Perfective 
Ingham calls the use of Najdi I'ila! if, when "habitual" (1994: 138). 
Moroccan and Kuwaiti speakers use I'ital (Moroccan I'ita/) to mean 
when, nonnally followed by the perfective. Another type of habitual 
conditional involves the use of the particle I-mal with interrogatives in 
expressions meaning whenever, wherever, and whatever. These "habitual 
conditionals" nonnally take perfective verbs; however, they are not 
true conditionals but show the aspectual use of the perfective as a point 
in time. 
8.7.3.1 l'i1al, llal If, when 
The Moroccan and Kuwaiti conditional particle /"ilal (and Kuwaiti 
variant Ila!) may be used to mean when without a hypothetical sense. 
All my examples contain perfective verbs: 
K3 
 '-'J I JL.. 'J! J.  
bet ¯ 'ita gar ::lŸ-Ÿ::ll:ta yisawwOn cay 
house T if became-it the-mid-moming they-make tea 
The T's, when it becomes mid-morning, they have tea 
Moroccan speakers also use /'i1a! in this sense. Harrell cites the following 
example (1962: 172): 
M 
   .I  IJ 4- 'J! 
'l\a za razl::lk f::l-l-lil, x::lllih I:t::ltta yn'::ls 
[if came-he husband-your in-the-night, let-him until he-sleep] 
When your husband comes home tonight, leave him alone until 
he goes to sleep 

8.7 Conditional and Hypothetical Moods 
265 
Speakers of the central dialects, on the other hand, do not appear to use 
the corresponding conditional particle fiza! in this manner. 
8.7.3.2 I-mal-ever 
All four dialects share a construction that is a kind of habitual 
conditional: the particle I-mal suffixed to an interrogative particle to 
give the meaning -ever. This construction utilizes I-rna! as a conditional 
marker and is normally followed by a perfective in Moroccan and 
Syrian (for Syrian, see Cowell 1964:338).

In Egyptian, the habitual conditional with a perfective occurs 
most commonly with the particle Imahma! no matter how much. is 
E5 
,- . d.- /  
mahma 'amalt mi4 J:taysamil:mi 
however-much did-I neg fut-he-forgive-me 
No matter what I do he'll never forgive me (elicited) 
l1'he first syllable of Imahmal , Imah/, is presumably a Classical variant of 
interrogative Ima! (see Wright 1898i:274). 

266 
Mood 
Kuwaiti speakers use I-mal conditionals with perfective and 
imperfective verbs. An elderly, uneducated Kuwaiti speaker uses an 
imperfective here: 
K3 
ƦJƧ L.. V:!J ৌX L.. V:!J .Èl...i ǢI 
al-l:tin ta'aley, wen rna tdiJJin wen rna tIiil:tin 
now come-f, where ever you-enter where ever you-go 
Nowadays come [look], wherever you come and go [you see it] 
8.7.4 Aspect and Mood in Conditional Sentences 
Both aspect and mood appear to play a role in the choice of verb 
form in conditionals from all four dialects. 
Ingham's analysis of 
conditional sentences in Najdi makes a useful distinction between stative, 
punctual, and habitual conditionals (1994: 133-); his analysis of Najdi 
Arabic serves as a useful comparative framework. The aspectual nature 
of the event is reflected by the choice of verb stem: the perfective 
often represents a punctual action, whereas the imperfective or a zero­
verb marks a continuous or stative action or event. 
At the same time, degree of hypotheticality plays an important 
role in determining verb stem. Cowell emphasizes the hypothetical 
nature of the use of the perfective with I>izal (1964:33 1-33), and the 
higher expectation created by the absence of the perfective. Non­
perfective predicates often signal generalities, or that the speaker expects 
the condition to be fulfilled (see Cowell 1964:333). 
The more 
hypothetical the situation, the higher the tendency of the speaker to 
choose .a perfective verb form, while zero-verb or the imperfective 
normally indicate a "non-hypothetical" conditional mood!6 
The perfective is the true conditional mode, in the sense that 
there exists an equal possibility of the event happening and not happening, 
so it remains neutral or unmarked in this context. The use of the 
imperfective indicates a higher degree of speaker expectation or 
commitment to the possibility of it happening, and is marked in this 
context. The range of conditional choices the speaker makes may be 
represented as a continuum of hypotheticality, shown in Figure 3. 
'&Yhe term "non-hypothetical conditional" is borrowed from Haiman, who 
uses it to designate a conditional whose protasis is factual (1985:33-4, cited in 
Croft 1990: 167). 

8.7 Conditional and Hypothetical Moods

Counterfactual: 
/kan/ with 
perfective 
Punctual hypothetical: 
perfective 
267 
Stative hypothetical: 
imperfective or 
zero-verb 
The speaker chooses from among zero-verbs, imperfectives, and 
perfectives according to the degree of hypotheticality and the aspect of 
the action. Non-hypothetical factive conditionals, or conditionals with 
a degree of expectation, tend to be stative and tend not to contain 
perfective verbs, except if the aspect is punctual. Less factive, more 
hypothetical clauses tend to be punctual and tend to contain perfective 
verb forms. Counterfactual conditionals usually contain, in addition to 
a perfective verb form, a reflex of /kant as well. It is as if the temporal 
distance signalled by /kan/ in these counterfactual conditionals indicated 
a kind of "hypothetical" distance, or speaker distance from a commitment 
to the truth of the conditional. 
The following Syrian passage contains a two-part conditional 
with two different morphological forms: imperfective /mma Yi:Iibbu/ 
they are in love and perfective /sim'u/ they heard. Both are governed 
by the particle /'iza/; the difference cannot then be temporal and must 
be modal or aspectual. The progressive indicative /mma Yi:Iibbu/ gives 
the imperfective aspect of an action that takes place over a long period 
of time. By contrast, the perfective /sim'u/ they heard, gives a perfective 
aspect: a one-time, non-durative, completed event. The choice of verb 
form here is not temporal but aspectual.

The next example is taken from a Kuwaiti folklorist's interview 
of an elderly woman about life in the old days. The use of the imperfective 

268 
Mood 
/tl)am1/ she gets pregnant here has nothing to do with time reference, 
marked past by the context; rather, the imperfective here signals a 
factive modality: 
K4 
'1 ఐ ¿఑ఒ ut ఓ L. ŕl ljl 
'iga 'ihiya rna tl)am1 4 yigulUn 'anha? 
if she neg she-gets-pregnant what they-say about-her? 
If she wouldn't get pregnant what would they say about her? 
By contrast, in the next example, the speaker uses a perfective verb in 
reference to the present. The aspect is punctual, hence the choice of 
the perfective: 
K3 
ɳ Č rD1 .:.1.- L.. 'i ! LAୠ ! lli4-

and the-praying, kid! teach-p-her! if neg prayed-she today, she­
pray tomorrow 
As for praying, she's a kid! teach her! If she doesn't pray today, 
she'll pray tomorrow 
If hypotheticality is signalled by the use of the perfective, then 
conditional sentences that set up an either/or choice with equal 
probabilities should normally contain a perfective verb. In the next 
example, whether the matchmaker gets the entire fee or not is contingent 
upon whether she works by herself or with another matchmaker. Both 
equally likely possibilities are marked with the perfective /kant:

The next passage, from Syria, contains a double conditional 
showing a modal difference. Both clauses in the following are stative; 
the first, fiza l,1ilwe/ if she is pretty, contains no verb, and the second, 
fiza mli Unit mit(allme/ if she [was] not educated, contains the-verb 
/kanit/ she was. The meaning of the first clause would not change very 
much with the omission of /'iza/, and is thus marked by the speaker as 
being factive through the absence of /kan/, while the second, the "true" 
conditional, is clearly hypothetical, and contains /klin/:

The next set of examples illustrate the role of aspect in determining 
verb stem choice in conditional sentences. If the conditional event is 
punctual, it tends to be expressed with a perfective. If the conditional 
is stative, on the other hand, it tends to be expressed with a non-perfective, 
often zero-verb. The following sentences all contain punctual actions 
expressed by perfective verbs: in the first, /(aĪitiha/ you gave it, in the 
second, /gat/ she came, and in the third, īiftha/ I saw her. The time 
references here include both future and non-specific non-past:

In contrast, Egyptian, Syrian, and Kuwaiti speakers often express 
stative conditionals with zero-verb, as the following examples 
demonstrate. In the first, from Kuwait, the second conditional /10 fil if 
there is has a past time reference, even though the clause does not 
contain a perfective but rather the tenseless participle IWayirl having 
occurred.

The zero-verb in the next example hints at what this matchmaker knows, 
thˎt many prospective grooms like the matches she picks for them. 
Hence she uses the zero-verb rather than lkanl in the conditional clause:

The following Kuwaiti passage responds to the question, "What 
do you tell your clients about prospective brides?" The matchmaker's 
answer contains six stative conditionals, three headed by /l}atta 10/ even 
if and three by /'ifja/. Of these six clauses, five contain imperfectives 
/t'artin/ you know, /a'arf/ I know or /tair/ she is related to, and one 
contains a tenseless perfect (participle) /daxla/ having entered. 
In 
addition, the text contains one punctual quasi-conditional (a clause 
hypothetical in meaning but missing a conditional particle) so marked 
by the use of the perfective: /inti 'aÜetini raqam it-tilifon/ [if, let's say] 
you gave me the telephone number.

Moroccan presents an exception to this pattern, not allowing 
zero-verb conditional clauses. All of Harrell's conditional examples 
contain /krm/ (1962: 170-7 1) as do Caubet's (1993:205), and mine:t1 
M6

17The only Moroccan conditional I found with a zero-verb is the following: 
M 
.୍..r- ..!.l୎୏! ୐j ୑୒I 4J JL.:i 
qal-lha zri 'a binti 'ila 'ndk §i §;;,fra 
said-he-to-her run 0 daughter-my if at-you some knife 
He said to her, Run daughter, please, if you have a knife {bring it]. 
However, it is doubtful that this should even be classified as a conditional, 
since the expression /'ila rna; is used as a polite request formula (Harrell 
1962: 171). While /ma/ is missing from this particular utterance, the sentence 
clearly expresses a polite request to bring the knife. 

8.7 Conditional and Hypothetical Moods 
273 
By way of concluding the discussion on conditionals, the analysis 
proposed here will be applied to several Syrian texts that happen to 
contain a number of conditional sentences. These passages may contain 
more information than at first meets the ear. 
\ 
The following short sentence contains an imperfective verb, 
marked for low hypotheticality. The speaker herself has previously 
mentioned that she did learn the language (English). Having removed 
herself from the field of possible "subjects," the use of the imperfective 
suggests that being in a foreign country and not learning the language 
is in fact a regular occurrence, and further, serves to elevate her own 
achievement of learning English.

Three final passages all come from an interview with a young 
female Syrian informant. The topic of the first passage is marriage 
customs, specifically financial expectations and the right of the girl to 
choose whom she will marry. Talking in generalities, and not about a 
particular situation, the speaker uses /'iza/ repeatedly with zero-verb or 
pseudo-verbs (marked in boldface). The absence of /kan/ here gives 
her statements a degree of expectation of fulfillment, making them less 
hypothetical. Whether or not the groom buys gold jewelry for his 
fiancee, either situation can and does occur regularly. In contrast to 
these non-tensed forms, an even if clause contains the perfective verb 
/i'tara<;lu/ they objected, showing both the non-stative nature of the verb 
and less speaker commitment to the regularity of parental objection.

this case, not only does /kant give a higher degree of hypotheticality, 
but it may also signal the speaker's own "distance" from the ideas she 
is expressing. While the speaker admits of the possibility of girls

Mood 
8.8 Summary 
Of all the syntactic features examined in this study, modality 
shows the greatest range of variation from dialect to dialect. While 
Moroccan and Egyptian show essentially the same modal system, their 
indicative prefixes differ. Egyptian and Syrian appear to share the 
indicative marker /b(i)-/, but the range of meaning of Syrian /b-/ only 
partially overlaps with its Egyptian counterpart. Evidence suggests 
that Syrian /b-/ may have two sources: intentive /b-/, found in the 
Gulf, which AI-Najjar claims derives from the verb /'abi/ I want 
( 1984:87-90), and another source, perhaps preposition /b-/, giving an 
indicative (continuous or habitual) meaning. 
While Moroccan, Egyptian, and Syrian speakers have developed 
indicative markers, Kuwaiti seems to be headed in another direction by 
developing a non-indicative marker, /ean/, which has several functions, 
including a modal would, an irrealis conditional, and a narrative device 
that may signal non-progressive or non-present action. More research, 
and more contextualized data, are needed in this area. 
In general, the use of the morphological tense forms in conditional 
sentences is not subject to temporal considerations, but rather reflects 
aspectual and modal factors. Speakers normally choose a perfective 
verb or /kan/ in punctual conditionals, a choice which contrasts with 
their consistent use of imperfective and zero-verbs in stative conditionals. 
These patterns show clearly the primacy of aspecͽnot tense-{o the 
choice of verb form in conditional sentences. Finally, the association 
of /kan/ with counterfactual mood remains consistent across dialects. 

9 NEGATION 
9.0 
Introduction 
Of all the syntactic features examined in this study, only one 
major feature emerges as an isogloss separating eastern and western 
dialect areas: the use of /-4/ as a negative enclitic. 
The western 
dialects, Moroccan and Egyptian, combine variants of /ma/ with /-M, 
while Kuwaiti and urban Syrian dialects use /mat and particles derived 
from it. Of course, the isogloss that separates east and west is difficult 
to locate and is surely not a continuous line: features do not disappear 
abruptly but rather fade out gradually, and the history and socio-sectarian 
diversity of the Levant have contributed to a rich patterning of dialects 
in the region, some of which use /-4/ in negation (Cowell 1964:383, 
Feghali 1928:220-21). Despite this surface-structure variation, however, 
all four dialects exhibit striking parallels in negative strategies and 
structures on the whole. Studying cross-dialectal patterns of negation 
can thus serve both to elucidate historical developments in spoken 
Arabic, and to demonstrate the importance of looking beyond surface 
structure to underlying strategies and pragmatic principles in studying 
the syntax of spoken language. 
9.1 
Overview of Negation in the Dialects 
Grammars of the dialects vary in their treatment of negation, but 
all of them present negation in lists of particles and their possible uses. 
I will first present a brief overview of the most comprehensive treatments 
of negation in each dialect, then attempt to find parallels and pragmatic 
functions that can explain negation in the dialects with more precision 
and economy. 
Harrell's Reference Grammar of Moroccan Arabic lists a "Basic 
Procedure" in which the split particle /ma - 4/ is used, a separate category 
of "Negative Imperative" in which the same construction forms the 
prohibitive, "Additional Negative Forms," in which the /-4/ is omitted, 
a separate category of "Categorical Negative" in which the /-4I is also 
dropped, and under "Non-Verbal Negation," he notes that "[nlouns and 
277 

278 
Negation 
adjectives are also sometimes prefixed with Imal and suffixed with 
lsi/" (1962: 152-55). The presentation is a bit confusing, since a total of 
seven separate categories are given to detail three syntactic structures, 
and it appears that nouns and adjectives can be negated exactly as 
verbs. However, Harrell's analysis attempts to ascertain the various 
syntactic strategies that Moroccan Arabic uses, and his construction of 
'categorical negation' as a distinct negating strategy with its own syntactic 
marking stands out as a significant contribution to the description of 
negation in Moroccan. In fact, this pragmatic function exists in all four 
dialects, as will be shown in 9.5. 
Woidich (1968) examines in great detail every possible negative 
construction in Egyptian Arabic, resulting in a complete inventory of 
negation in Egyptian Arabic. His presentation is quite detailed, but no 
overall picture of negating strategies emerges. 
Cowell classifies negation in Syrian Arabic according to four 
negative particles: Imal, Imu/, /la/, and the "negative copula" (1964:383-
88). 
Cowell's streamlined approach describes the basic syntactic 
strategies in this dialect, making it useful for comparative studies. 
Cowell's distinction of the 'negative copula' as a separate syntactic 
category also has comparative value, and is adopted here as a subcategory 
of verbal negation. 
Holes (1990) divides negation in Gulf Arabic into two categories, 
"sentence negation" and "constituent negation." Under the former, he 
lists Ima/ for perfective and imperfective verbs, /la/ for imperatives, 
and /la .. wila/ for coordinated clauses; under the latter, he includes 
Imul and its variants.' Holes also illustrates another unnamed negative 
structu_re in which /ma/ is prefixed to personal pronouns (1 990:244). 
He makes several important observations on the pragmatic aspects of 
the various syntactic structures, most notably his distinction between 
sentence negation and constituent negation, and his analysis of /mu/ as 
the negation of a negative sentence proposition (such as, It's not that I 
don't want to 1990:72). Johnstone's cursory treatment of Kuwaiti records 
I Holes lists /mfib/ as the primary negative particle for this category (1990:73); 
according to my data this is not commonly used in Kuwait, where /mul is 
preferred. The particle Imu/ has a feminine variant Imi/ which also does not 
occur in my data (Holes 1990:73-4). 

9.1 Overview of Negation in the Dialects 
279 
"negation of adjectives and participles" by /mu/ and negation of "other 
nominal constructions" by /mat; he also lists "negated forms of the 
personal pronouns" (1967: 148). 
What can be concluded from a preliminary comparison of these 
analyses? Features that appear to be common to two or more dialects 
include the fact that most of the'se dialects discriminate between a 
loosely 'verbal' category and a corresponding 'non-verbal' one that 
negates predicated structures. Moroccan and Egyptian dialects negate 
verbs with /ma - 'f./, urban Syrian and Kuwaiti with /mat. Sentence 
predicates are negated in the western dialects with /mi'f./ or /maW while 
the eastern dialects normally use /mu/ or a variant thereof. Examples 
from each of the dialect regions illustrate these patterns. The first two 
sentences exemplify verbal negation in the western dialects: 
Ml l «.llj c.fJ1 ¬WI d:!.l ­I 4J ૓૔  L.

rna §uftW§ ii-mOdel da 'ab1 kida

I didn't see that style before 
The following sentences illustrate predicate negation in these dialects, 
with /ma'f.i/ in Moroccan, and /mW in Egyptian:

The next Syrian passage contains both verbal negation, /ma btufruq/ it 
makes no diference, and non-verbal negation, /mu m'allme/ not educated:

it's all the same [to him]. Now too it's all the same, that is, [if]

or not, also it makes no difference to him. 
Likewise, this Kuwaiti sentence includes verbal negation Ima yil)ibbhal 
he doesn't love her, and non-verbal negation Imil l)ilwa/ not pretty: 
K3

that-one neg pretty but he-loves-her 
A man has a wife, two wives, one is pretty but he doesn't love 
her, the other one is not pretty but he loves her 
. 
However, these unmarked forms of negation exist alongside other 
marked forms in which the use of these particles is reversed: that is, 
Ima - ƩI and Imal can negate syntactic predicates, while ImBI and Imill 
can negate verbs. The first two following sentences contain examples 
of the verbal particles Ima -ƩI and Imii/ negating predicates, Ima ma'rua/ 
[he is] unknown, and Ima lazirn/ must not. The third and fourth examples 
contain the predicate negative particles ImW and Imill negating verbs, 
ImiƩ tisallimil [should] you not say hello, and Imil yiyinil he [better] 
not come to me.

281 
Do these contradictory examples, or marked forms of negation, 
render invalid the proposed schema of negation as verbal and non-verbal? 
If it can be assumed that the use of these negative particles in a variety 
of syntactic environments is not arbitrary, there must exist underlying 
principles guiding the choice of negating particle. I will begin by 
distinguishing between unmarked and marked usage, and demonstrate 
certain pragmatic principles which can account for both types of negation. 
9.2 
Three Strategies of Negation 
It is significant that all four dialects have two basic particles of 
negation. These are: in Moroccan and Egyptian, ( 1)  /ma - 4/ and (2) 
variants of /mi4/ in Egypt or /ma4i/ in Morocco; and in Syrian and 
Kuwaiti, (1) /ma/ and (2) /mu/ and variants. 
Both the syntax and 
pragmatics of these pairs correspond closely to one another from dialect 
to dialect, indicating that negation in all four dialects is of two standard 
types, which will be called Verbal Negation and Predicate Negation, in 
order to reflect their normal, unmarked usage. Table 9- 1 summarizes 
the particles of each type.

The categories verbal and predicate negation have the additional 
advantage of reflecting Arabic sentence typology. Spoken as well as 
formal Arabic make use of two main sentence patterns, called by the 
medieval grammarians the verbal sentence (Arabic /al-jumla al-fi'liyyal) 
and the nominal sentence (/al-jumla al-ismiyyal). The former exhibits 
VSO typology and represents unmarked sentence order in formal Arabic 
(it is the normal structure for subordinate clauses such as relative clauses). 
Nominal sentences exhibit SVO order and reflect topic-prominent word 
order (see 10. 1). While the claim has been made and repeated that 
modem spoken Arabic has all but lost its VSO typology, Chapter 10 
will present evidence that refutes this claim. Both VSO and SVO 
typologies play prominent roles in spoken Arabic, and the fact that the 
dialects have different negating strategies for these two patterns offers 
one piece of evidence in support of this hypothesis. 
The terms 'verbal' and ' predicate ' negation refer to the normal, 
unmarked negation of VSO and SVO typologies respectively. They 
are not meant to refer to absolute structural rules: while the verbal 
negation particles normally negate verbs and pseudo-verbs, and the 
predicate negation particles normally negate nominal sentences, data 
from all of the dialects include examples of marked negation patterns 
that violate these "rules," as I have shown. One possible explanation 

9.2 Three Strategies of Negation 
283 
for these apparent violations is that sentences of the same syntactic 
type may not necessarily have the same underlying pragmatic structure. 
In fact, there exist few absolute syntactic restrictions on the use of 
negative particles with various sentence constituents, and purely formal 
syntactic analysis cannot completely explain negation in spoken Arabic. 
In addition to the two standard particles, each of these dialects 
has a negative particle that will be called here, following Cowell, the 
"negative copula." The negative copula represents a special case within 
verbal negation, is distinguished by its combination of a verbal negation 
particle with a personal pronoun, and differs in structure and function 
from a negatively predicated sentence. For example, Egyptian Arabic 
allows both of the following: 
E 
l.:.A ut-a ".. 
huwwa mi4 hina 
He is not here 
E 
l.:.A c.J.1.,.a1. 
mahuwwM hina 
He is not here 
The analysis that follows will show a pragmatic distinction between 
these two structures. 
In addition to verbal negation and predicate negation, a third 
type of negation found cross-dialectally is a kind of emphatic negation 
I will call "categorical negation," adapting the term from Harrell. Like 
its syntactically more restricted counterpart in formal Arabic, the !la! of 
absolute negation /lii al-niifiya li-I-jins/, categorical negation negates 
absolutely and categorically. Syntactically, categorical negation is 
marked in the western dialects by the absence of /-4/. While the eastern 
dialects have no counterpart to western /-4/, there exists evidence for 
this category in the use of negation in listing, for which all the dialects 
share a form of categorical negative listing, using the particle /la/. 
There thus exist three different types or strategies of negation 
shared by all four dialects: verbal, predicate, and catagorical negation. 
All of these negative strategies share essentially the same pragmatic 
functions across all four dialects, with minor regional variations that 
will be explored in the following sections.

9.3 
Verbal Negation 
The basic function of the particles of verbal negation Ima - ÃI and 
Imal is to negate the imperfective and perfective verb fonns. Examples

All the examples cited above represent unmarked patterns of 
negation. The main exception to this rule is found in urban Egypt, 
where the future /I:la- + imperfective/ is obligatorily negated with /mi4/, 
which normally functions as the particle of predicate negation?

286 
Negation 
In the case of complex verb phrases, or verb phrases that consist 
of more than one constituent, such as compound verbs, the first linear 
element normally constitutes the focus of syntactically and semantically 
unmarked negation. In the western dialects, Imal and I-TI enclose the 
focused element: 
MIO ǲI ǳ utǢ L. JY..;JI .l.lJ 
wld l-blad rna bqM kaymTi l-bJ:tar

The people of the town no longer go to the beach 
E3 
U). iIS L. ..,-A 
hiyya rna kfinig 'arfa 
she neg was-she knowing 
She didn't know 
In the eastern dialects, Imal precedes the focused element. In 
compound verb phrases, this focused element may be a temporal verb, 
as /kan/ was , used to in the following Kuwaiti example, or a temporally 
embedded verb, like /yTUful they see in the Syrian example: 
K2 
I • m h 
• IS L. J I 
.... ע u  
J 
'awwel rna kan yTUfha

fathers-our and grandfathers-our were-they neg they-see the-bride 
until-night of-the-wedding 
Qur fathers and grandfathers used not to see the bride until the 
wedding night 
The syntactic flexibility of the western dialects permits other 
elements to be targeted when they constitute the semantic focus of 
negation. In the following minimal pair, the first sentence was uttered 
during a conversation about the next day's activities. Since it was a 
normal work day, the speaker's statement can be seen as a negation of 
a natural presupposition that he was physically going to work, hence 
the focus of negation on going. 

9.3 Verbal Negation 
Ml I0 r1 ஒl. l.

but with a focus on not working. 
Ml 10 .1 J.1. 
mM n;)xd;)m4 gWdda 
neg-will I-work tomorrow 
I'm not working tomorrow (elicited) 
In Moroccan, indirect and oblique objects may fall inside or 
outside the focus. The following minimal pair shows that indirect 
objects with the preposition /Ii/ to may fall inside or outside the scope 
of negation:

The next examples show prepositional phrases with /li/ and /fi/ contained 
within the scope of the negating particle:

Cowell lists as possible foci of Syrian /rna/ "verbs and other 
verb-like expressions" (1964:384). This description applies to all four 
dialects, and the "other verb-like expressions" consist of pseudo-verbs, 
which are negated like verbs in all dialects, with /rna - Ã/ or /rnfJ./:

Pseudo-verbs consisting of nominal and prepositional phrases 
are thus normally n'!gated as verbs. The following section will examine 
another class of "verb-like expressions" that can at times function as 
pseudo-verbs: participles? 
9.3.2 Negation of Participles 
Negation patterns involving participles reflect the partially verbal 
nature of this syntactic category. Participles are commonly predicated, 
and in such cases are negated with predicate negation. The following 
Moroccan, Egyptian, and Syrian examples contain participles /Sarfa/ 
having grown old, /(arfa/ having found out, knowing and !babbe/ having 
fallen in love with negated with predicate negatives /maW, /mis/, and 
/mu/ respectively:

(or whatnot) 
In this Kuwaiti passage, negation of the verbal phrase /ma tiStWgWl/ 
doesn't work contrasts with the predicated participle /mil mitl)ajjba/ not 
veiled:

In the examples cited above, the participles all designate states. 
In other cases, participles carry more verbal meaning, often representing 
perfect aspect (see 6.4), and sometimes (in the case of active participles) 
taking syntactic objects. 
Hence it is not surprising that participles 
occasionally become more "verb-like," and that, in such cases, they 
may be negated with /ma/ in Syrian and Kuwaiti or /ma - T/ in Morocco 
and much of rural Egypt.4 The following examples contain participles 
with verbal meaning and verbal negation:

In this Syrian passage, the passive participle /ma()UI/ reasonable is 
negated with verbal /ma/ because it functions here as a pseudo-verb, 
4Woidich's Egyptian examples containing /bayin/ seeming and /fa<;lil/ 
remaining negated with /ma - / are to be explained thus as well (1968:32).

Verbal negation of participles in Egypt seems in part to be a 
matter of geography. Behnstedt and Woidich draw an isogloss separating 
the negation of the active participle with /mg/ as opposed to /ma - §/ in 
southern Egypt: the former is used from Cairo to al-Minya, and the 
latter south of al-Minya (1985: 1 1 1). However, they do not clarify 
whether participle negation with /ma - §/ is optional, as is the case in 
Moroccan Arabic, or obligatory. Examples from their rural Egyptian 
data include /ma xabirhɲ/ I don't know himlit (1994:107) and /ma-ɳayid§/ 
I am not fishing (1994:271).5 
9.3.3 Verbal Negation of Predicates in Moroccan 
It was noted above that verbal negation in the western dialects 
permits direct and oblique objects to be contained within the clitics /ma 
- §/ such that the semantic target of negation is focused. Moroccan 
differs slightly from Cairene Arabic in that it allows a comparatively 
broad range of syntactic structures, including non-verbal predicates, to 
be contained within the scope of the verbal negative /ma - 4/: 
Ml 
ଷIJ .... L.

51 am grateful to Devin Stewart for providing references to these and subsequent 
examples of /ma - §/ negation in Behnstedt and Woidich (1994). 

292 
Negation 
The next utterance came in response to a question about a Moroccan 
writer. The speaker, surprised at the question, denies the implied 
presupposition that the writer is well-known in Morocco: 
M3

A hotel clerk in Fez replied in response to a telephone inquiry asking to 
speak to a guest (whom the caller presupposes is in his room): 
M 
JoJ-H-J-A L. 
rna muwzUd; 
neg present-; 
{He's] not here 
Caubet designates this type of negation as marked, citing the 
following as a "polemic response" (1993ii:70, translation mine): 
M 
! Jo௥ L. .'/ 
-
! ଶ d;:..i.1
-
xt?k qbil)a ! 
--- la, rna qbil)a ; ! 
--- sister-your malicious! 
--- neg, neg malicious 
--- Your sister is malicious! --- No, not at all malicious! 
This kind of negation thus appears to be marked in Moroccan. 
Similar examples from rural Egypt, however, do not appear to be marked. 
Behnstedt and Woidich's glossary contains a number of examples in 
which non-verbal entities are negated with /ma - ;/ in rural Egypt, 
among them the following pair, the first from the Fayyum, and the 
second from the Delta ( 1994: 100, 444; translations mine).

9.3 Verbal Negation 
293 
In the other dialects, verbal negation of a nominal predicate 
represents marked usage. In the next two Cairene examples, the use of 
/ma - §/ to negate nominal predicates marks the denial of a presupposition. 
In the first sentence, the speaker has been called by the name Sayyid, 
but denies that this is his name. In the second, the speaker has been 
misunderstood, and seeks to correct the misunderstanding.

Cowell gives several analogous Syrian examples, among them 
the following, in which verbal /ma/ negates the pronoun /huwwe/ he. 
Cowell's translation clearly indicates that this speaker is denying the 
presupposition that /huwwe/ he is responsible (Cowell 1964:385): 
S 
o!.o.l6J1 ! J,J,;..JI ,YI L. 
rna huwwe l-mas'UI 'an ɵl-I}ades 
[neg he the-responsible for the-accident] 
He's not the one responsible for the accident 
My Kuwaiti corpus contains a single example of verbal /ma/ 
negating a nominal form, but I believe it is more accurately analyzed as 
the result of the interrogative /le§/ attracting /ma/ to a pre-verbal 
interrogative position: 
K2

Negation 
If a boy calls me up and says to me, I want [you to find me a 
wife] I have doubts about him, why didn't his mother or why 
didn't his sister call me and tell me? 
There is thus no evidence for marked verbal negation in Kuwaiti (with 
the exception of the negative copula; see 9.3.5). 
9.3.4 Negation of the Imperative: The Prohibitive 
The prohibitive constitutes a special case of verbal negation, in 
that some dialects use a different negating particle with this mood than 
they do with the indicative and subjunctive moods. The Moroccan and 
Egyptian dialects employ /ma - ;/ to indicate the prohibitive, while 
Syrian and Kuwaiti nonnally use /I'd/ rather than /ma/. However, there 
is a great deal of geographical overlap in the use of these two particles: 
while /ma/ is found across North Africa and into Syria, /la/ is used in 
the prohibitive everywhere except Cairo, including the Egyptian Delta, 
and seems to be the only particle used in Kuwait: 
Kl 
wx 'i wI..!.&. .r 'i JǇ 'i b B N 'i ণ 
bass la tI:lU!Hi fi la 'lid la ;ay la hada 'a;an la YQissOn 
only neg you-put for-me in-it neg stick neg thing so-that neg 
they-feel 
But don't put in it either a stick or anything else so they won't 
sense [what it is] 
The distribution of /13./ and /ma/ might be geographical in the 
Syrian and Egyptian areas. Speaker S2 is from a Christian village 
south of Aleppo, while S5 is from Aleppo: 
52 
િ6. .:..:.ts IA LAPl.:. 'i

affairs)

9.3 Verbal Negation

A colleague reports that /la - 4I is normally used in villages in the 
Egyptian Delta: 7 
E 
ଲ'i 
la ti4kI4 
neg you-complain 
Don't complain 
Cairene speakers, on the other hand, use Ima - 4I exclusively:

,",c:,! . ਜਝ L.. 
ો c.)-A ..;- .....-:-
rna tidfa'i4 'aktar min miten 
neg you-pay more than two-hundred 
Don't pay more than two hundred 
The coexistence of /lat and Imal as prohibitive particles should 
signal a distinction in pragmatic function, and indeed, Harrell found in 
his study of Moroccan that /lat carries a "morally admonishing" sense 
(1962: 153). His analysis is supported by my data: the same speaker 
uttered the following pair of sentences, the first to a group of peers, the 
second to her husband. If it can be assumed that one takes more care 
to be polite with friends than with relatives, then her use of the /lat 
form with her husband and Imal with her peers suggests that /la - 4I 
carries less imperative force than Ima - 4/:

M9 ĉ uf.S, .0; L. 
rna taQl}ak4 'liyya 
neg you-laugh at-me 
Don't make fun of me! 
Lack of sufficient contextualized examples makes it difficult to 
detennine whether the same distinction holds true in other dialects that 
share both particles. The patterning of Imal and /lal across dialects 
indicates that further research into the prohibitive might yield insight 
into linguistic variation and the processes of change. 
1Dwight Reynolds gave me this example from his fieldwork in the Delta.

Negation 
9.3.5 The Negative Copula 
All four dialects have a special negated copula form consisting 
of a personal pronoun combined with Ima - JI or Ima/. Cowell calls 
this form in Syrian the "negative copula" (1964:387), this term fits 
analogous copulas in the other three dialects as well. I include in this 
category a parallel form consisting of the impersonal pronoun, /l)ad(d)(a)1 
one, negated with the verbal particle to give the meaning no one . 
Table 9-2 lists the forms of the negative copula.

Moroccan forms are taken from Harren (1962:155-56), Syrian from Cowen 
(1964:387-88), and Kuwaiti adapted from Johnstone (1967: 148; cf. Holes 
1990:244), with several additional forms taken from my data. Cowen also 
notes the existence of a third Syrian stem, /mann-/ that shares the pronoun 
suffixes of /man-/ and /mal-/; I have found this latter set common in Beirut. 

9.3 Verbal Negation 
297 
In Moroccan, Egyptian, and Kuwaiti dialects, the negative copula 
shares not only syntactic, but also pragmatic characteristics. 
Syntactically, this form is marked by the use of verbal negation to 
negate a nominal form. Pragmatically, the contradictory force of the 
negative copula, which negates verbless sentences, stands in marked 
comparison to the neutral constructions in which a copulative sentence 
with a pronoun subject is negated with /mi4, ma4i/ or /mfJ/. Contextualized 
examples illustrate that the negative copula in these three dialects marks 
the negation of a presupposition on the part of the interlocutor. 
The context of the following Kuwaiti example is that a group of 
people are going downstairs, but the speaker has decided not to join 
them. His use of /mani/ I am not negates the presupposition that he 
will join the group. The second example is analogous, for the speaker 
does (or did) have a family, but it is not the people to whom she is 
speaking. However, she has been living with them, so they have assumed 
the role of her family; here, they are attempting to discipline her and 
she resists by negating their assumption that they have a right to do so.

The speaker later mimics the petty way in which people argue about 
social status. The negative copula /mantu/ you are not represents the 
attempt of one party to deny the other the very status the former claims:

her interlocutors that the /'umra/ minor pilgrimage is an obligation for 
Muslims:

sunna (imitating the practice of the Prophet) 
Each of the next two Moroccan sentences represents the speaker's denial 
of a presupposition. The first, taken from the lyrics of a popular song, 
signals the speaker's feelings of alienation. The second carries the 
implication ff .. . so stop treating us as ifwe were!'

[neg-we children sitting with-you] 
We aren't children sitting with you (Harrell 1962: 155) 
The pragmatic function shared by the negative copulas of all 
these dialects, then, seems to lie in contradicting a presupposition, by 
targeting the subject pronoun and emphatically negating the applicability 
of the predicate to the subject. In this sense it actually represents a 
marked usage of verbal negation. parallel to other instances of marked 
negation noted above (9.3.4). 
Syrian dialects, however, present a more complex case. Analysis 
of the forms in Table 9-2 reveals that the Syrian negative copula has 
developed into a pseudo-verb, because its semantic subject is expressed 
in the form of an object pronoun, whereas the other dialects all exhibit 

9.3 Verbal Negation 
299 
the standard negative particles affixed to independent personal pronouns. 
This syntactic development parallels an apparent difference in pragmatic 
function. While the negative copula represents a pragmatically marked 
form in Moroccan, Egyptian, and Kuwaiti, the Syrian negative copula 
seems not to be pragmatically marked. 
A Damascene informant 
emphasizes that, of ImOI and the negative copula, ImOI represents the 
more "emphatic" or marked form. In my Syrian data, the use of ImOI 
seems to be restricted to negating "subjectless" sentences, such as the 
first example below, or sentential subjects, as in the second examp'le, in ' 
which /l:lada yfakkir fi[h]al for anyone to think of her functions as the 
subject of Imo mumkinl not possible (mirrored in the English translation 
with the "dummy" subject it:

It is not possible anymore for anyone to think of [marrying] her 
The negative copula, on the other hand, negates sentences that have a 
pronoun subject or topic, such as the following: 
S2 
ȤI D #L. ¶t.:.- Ȥ7 .:.fil L. l,jl 
'iza rna fakkart bi-I-muztama' ma'nat[h]a mani min il-muztama'

The pattern that emerges in Syrian, then, is that sentences with pronoun 
subjects or topics are negated with the negative copula, while topicless 
sentences are negated with Imol (see also 9.4).

Negation 
In addition to the Syrian negative copulas listed in Table 9-2, 
Cowell remarks that /mahu/ and /mahi/ are variants of the third person 
singular negative copula used in "some areas" (1964:388). In my data, 
these variants occur in the speech of an Aleppan informant:

The impersonal negative copula is unmarked in all dialects, in 
the sense that there is no alternative word for no one. However, the 
meaning of no one itself is marked in a certain way: it is an example 
of categorical negation, which is a related form of marked negation 
(see 9.5) Typical examples of the impersonal negative copula from

The one syntactic characteristic common to all of the data given 
in this section is that verbal negation particles /ma/ and /ma - s/ negate 
verbs and pseudo-verbs, but do not normally negate predicated structures. 
It may be concluded that, in general, verbal negation is the least marked 

9.4 Predicate Negation 
301 
negation strategy in these dialects. Its basic function is to negate a 
particular sentence element, rather than a predicate taken as a whole 
proposition, and as such may be contrasted with predicate negation, 
which is a strategy that negates an entire predicate as a single, embedded 
proposition. 
9.4 
Predicate Negation 
The common particles of predicate negation are ImU/, in Syriɶ. 
and Kuwait, with variants Imahul (feminine Imahi/); ImB/, in Egypt, 
and Ima4il in Morocco. These particles negate predicated sentence 
constituents, including participles: 
M9

In marked predicated environments, this construction negates 
arguments that are predicated, whether they are verbal or nominal 
complements. The syntactic and semantic scope of the negation must 
be the entire predicate, and not just the verbal argument. The following 
examples are taken from contexts that are clearly predicated 
pragmatically. 
In the next Moroccan example, the comment ImMi Y:lddi mzyanl 
it's not that my hand is good is made in response to the compliment 
IyRddk mzyanl your hand is good. The thus speaker negates the entire 
proposition, as a predication.

A female Egyptian colleague uttered this remark in a casual conversation: 
E 
u-:i.>-! W 
mis bar'u 
neg indic-I-dance 
! don't dance 
Taking' advantage of her linguistic training. I discussed with her possible 
motivations given the context. We concluded that Imis b-I usually 
indicates a kind of categorical negation. a marked (but not emphatic) 
form of verbal negation. A similar example was heard from a teenage 
girl denying that she drinks (unhealthy) soft drinks: 
E 
d -< ,-,
' 
• L:.I 
J-" 
• ȭ (.)"'-A 
'ana mis basrab k6k 
I neg indic-I-drink Coke 
! don't drink Coke 

9.4 Predicate Negation 
303 
Another speaker uses this construction to deny an assumption expressed 
by her interlocutor that she is refusing his request: 
El 
. . .  'J J< . =I 
'ana mi4 ba'Ul la' 
I neg indic-I-say no 
I'm not saying no 
EI-Tonsi observes that female speakers tend to use this construction 
more than males, and that its occurrence is on the rise (personal 
communication). If /mi4 b-/ continues to spread, it may eventually lose 
its categorical status, perhaps the path that the Cairene future took from 
/ma l:ta - 4/ to the now obligatory /mi4 l:ta-/. 
The eastern dialects also use predicate negation as a marked 
form of negation with verbs. In the following Syrian passage, the use 
of /mO/ to negate the verb !byizi/ it comes about reflects its semantic 
predication, which is paraphrased in the English translation: 
S2 
i>IJ ?@ A "" ''iB'iB C >I"J1 
il-waI:tid byim4i 4wayy 4wayy, mO byizi c.tarbe wal:tde 
the-one he-moves a-little a-little, neg he-comes blow one 
One moves a little at a time, [it] isn't [the case that] it happens 
all at once 
The meaning of the following sentence, that the speaker wishes to be 
left alone, is likewise reflected in the syntactic predication of /yiyini/ 
he come to me (show up): 
Kl 
!ȁ "..
9  dJ4 ছ 
xal balak 'ala MJ:tammad -- mO yiyini! 
imper-keep attention-your to M -- neg he-comes-to-me! 
Pay attention to M -- [it better not happen that] he show up! 
Predicate negation is also used interrogatively to signal that the 
speaker presupposes and expects a positive answer to his or her question. 
In this case, the question is marked by a fronted particle of predicate 
negation, whether the question itself has an underlying verbal or 
predicated structure. In using predicate negation to frame a question, 
the speaker signals his or her own presupposition and requests 
confirmation or denial of that assumption. The following pair of Egyptian 

304 
Negation 
questions contrasts marked and unmarked uses of verbal negation. The 
first question clearly signals that the speaker had assumed her addressee 
had bought a suit and requests confirmation. Syntactically, it contrasts 
with the second question, in which normal (pragmatically unmarked) 
verbal /rna ... ;/ negation is used: 
El 
"U..1.:' D . 
mB gi bti badla? 
neg got-you suit 
Didn't you get a suit? 
E2 
"   L.. 
rna gibtiha; Ie? 
neg got-you-it why 
Why didn't you bring it? 
In the next example, the Moroccan speaker signals that he had assumed 
his addressee was at home and seeks confirmation or explanation: 
Ml 
" JI.l.lI "'; > ?L.. 
mMi kunti f d-dar? 
neg were-you in the-house? 
Weren't you in the house? 
Similarly, this Syrian speaker signals his assumption that his friend had 
finished what he was doing: 
So 
"ç "",, 
mO xallaW? 
neg finished-he? 
Didn't hefinish? 
In all of the previous examples, the negated constituents function 
syntactically and pragmatically as single pieces of information, and as 
such, are negated as predicates. There are other syntactic consequences 
as well. When the verb contained in this proposition is imperfective, 
this type of negation has the effect of further embedding it, giving it a 
subjunctive meaning. In the Kuwaiti example above, /mO yiyini/ may 
be loosely translated it had better not be the case that he come to me, 
reflecting the semantically subjunctive status of the verb /yiyini/ he 
come to me, as well as the pragmatically predicated status of the negated 

9.4 Predicate Negation 
305 
clause. (Since Kuwaiti does not distinguish between main and embedded 
imperfective fonns, syntactic embedding is not marked in this dialect.) 
Similarly, the embedded Imu tgulInl it's not (that) you'd say in the 
following sentence contrasts with its corresponding verbal negation, 
Ima tgulin/ you don't say/are not saying:

Well, our chalet, that is, not that you would say very lavish, but 
it's pretty 
In Moroccan, Egyptian, and Syrian, syntactic embedding is 
grammatically marked through the use of the unmarked imperfective. 
Therefore, the embedded status of predicate-negated verbal clauses is 
clear. Examples from each of these dialects illustrate this point. In the 
first, the unmarked imperfective /yiktib/ to write is syntactically, 
pragmatically, and semantically embedded:

In the next sentence as well, predicate negation particle Ima4i/ it's not

character.

306 
Negation 
The following two sentences show a clear pragmatic and syntactic 
contrast. On the left is a prohibitive with normal verbal negation; on 
the right, an embedded subjunctive carrying the force of an imperative 
or reprimand to a small child: 
En 
ુ.J";:' L. 
rna trul:tJ 
neg you-go 
Don't go 
El 
'ić ut-
miJ tisallimi? 
neg you-say-hello-f? 
Shouldn't you say hello? 
Predicate negation, then, represents an unmarked strategy for 
negating non-verbal predicates (with the possible exception of 
Moroccan). As a marked strategy, predicate negation negates a verbal 
argument as a whole, embedding it within a new overarching predicate 
structure. 
9.5 
Categorical Negation 
As noted above, the normal patterns of negation in the western 
dialects include the enclitic /-J/, as either /maJi/, /miJ/, or /ma - J/. 
While the first two are morphologically fixed, the third, /ma - J/, is not, 
for in a number of cases /-J/ is omitted. Harrell identifies this omission 
in Moroccan Arabic as the 'categorical negative,' since the negated 
complement "refers to a whole category rather than to some specific 
item or member of a category" ( 1962: 154). Harrell identifies both the 
syntactic and semantic features that identify this category in Moroccan, 
but he unnecessarily excludes some negative constructions that share 
these features. Egyptian Arabic, too, shares the omission of /-J/ in 
cases where the negation is absolute or unqualified, and all four dialects 
sh.are ,the syntactic structures /wala/ none, not any, and /la ... wala/ 
neither ... nor. With modification of Harrell's definition of "categorical" 
negation from negation of a "whole category" to absolute, unqualified 
negation, a coherent syntactic and pragmatic description of all these 
structures emerges. I will show that categorical or absolute negation 
exists at three levels in spoken Arabic: the verb phrase, a single sentence 
element, usually a noun phrase, and coordinated structures, by which I 
mean a list of entities that constitute a set (Le., this, that, and the 
other). 

9.5 Categorical Negation 
307 
9.5.1 Categorical Negation of the Verb Phrase 
Categorical verbal negation is syntactically marked only in dialects 
whose unmarked verbal particle is /ma - 4/. In Moroccan and Egyptian, 
this type of categorical negation is distinguished by the absence of the 
negative particle /-4/. In Moroccan speech, ī/ may be omitted from 
any verb phrase. Normally, /kayn/ there is is negated as /ma kayn4/ 
there isn't, but here /-4/ is omitted, signalling a categorical negation of 
the existence of help or sympathy.

reI he-help-you neg there-is and reI he-take-pity in-you neg there-is 
There's nobody to help you, nobody to take pity on you 
In Egyptian, the use of categorical negation in verb phrases is 
more limited than in Moroccan. It occurs mainly in oaths and certain 
fixed expressions, such as /cumr .. mal never and /waHahi/ by God! 
EIO ŰI ".,.  	I מ L. • .r-

Moroccan particles /<amm(::» r-/ ever, /ga</ at all, /(!:l::>t)ta/ any, 
/(!:l::>t)ta !:laza/ anything, /(!:l::>t)ta wa!:l::>d/ anyone, and /gir/ only, /ma/ 
anything, and /walu/ nothing, all function in negative sentences as 
particles of categorical negation, semantically and syntactically. Harrell 
specifies that they may not occur with /-J/ (1962: 153-54). Examples 
from my data include:

Syrian and Kuwaiti, on the other hand, lack I-sf, and hence verbal 
negation has no marked categorical form. However, these dialects 
share with Moroccan and Kuwaiti the two other types of categorical 
negation, discussed in the next two sections.

of environments.

9.5.3 Categorical Negation of Coordinated Structures 
A third type of categorical negation, called here "categorical 
negation of coordinated structures," is recorded, but not identified as 

310 
Negation 
such, in the grammars of Moroccan (Harrell 1962: 156), Egyptian 
(Mitchell 1956:46), Syrian (Cowell 1964:390), and Kuwaiti (Holes 
1990:72). Coordinated structures may consist of lists of nouns or 
parallel clauses, which are negated with the conjunctions /lii ... walal or 
Ila ... lal neither ... nor. The following Egyptian example, typical of 
this construction in all four dialects, contains two verbs in parallel 
construction, coordinated by /la ... wala/. The two phrases, la'dar 'a;Uf 
farxa btindibiIJI I can watch a chicken being slaughtered and la'dar 
'a;iif damml I can look at blood, are meant to be taken as a complete, 
closed set of acts that is "categorically" negated: 
E8 
rJ ....;I J'ul 'J.J ਭਮ Űű ...;I J'ul 'J IJJ4-:J1 ଢ L:.I 
'ana li-I:tadd in-naharda Hi a'dar 'a;iif farxa btindibil:t wala a'dar 
'a;iif damm 
I to-extent of-today neg I-can I-see chicken indic-it-is-slaughtered 
nor I-can I-see blood 
I to this day can neither watch a chicken being slaughtered nor 
look at blood 
The dialect grammars all describe this construction, but fail to 
point out that the use of particles Ila ... walal in negating coordinated 
structures is not syntactically obligatory. As the next three examples 
show, negative coordination may also be expressed as unmarked 
negation. In the first, the speaker lists two cities of origin among a 
number of possible alternatives before giving the correct information. 
Larache and Alcazr are not the only possible members of this set, they 
merely constitute representative members of the set: 
M 1 
4:..b &-0 .]A • ."...:LJ I &-0 ..,.-tL..J Y I.r-J I &-0 ..,..-tL. .]A

he neg from Larache and neg from Alcazr, he from Tangiers 
He's not from Larache and he's not from Alcazr, he's from Tangiers 
(elicited) 
In the next passage, the speaker lists several activities that a family in 
mourning refrains from doing. It is not an exhaustive listing, but a 
partial, illustrative, list, as signalled by the use of Imal rather than llii ... 
wala/.

neg they-wear colored, neg they-go invitations, neg they-hold

They don't wear colored (clothes), they don't accept social 
invitations, they don't hold weddings ... 
These unmarked negated structures coordinated by Iwl and stand 
in contrast to categorical negation with /la .. , walal, which signals a 
closed set of acts or entities that is completely negated or denied. The 
speaker in the next example does not want anyone to know he is 
having an alcoholic drink, and so requests that it be served without any 
of the typical decorations associated with such drinks:

312 
Negation 
Categorical negation of coordinated structures frequently involves 
double negatives, in which the verb is negated along with the listed 
items, whether they be nouns or clauses:

He did not do right, neither for himself nor his kids 
This type of categorical negation extends in some dialects to the 
negative copula, in which the morpheme Ima-I is replaced with /la-I. 
Examples from Lebanese (Feghali 1928:2 16, translation mine) and 
Kuwaiti:

It's all the same, I've neither gained nor lost 
Negative listing and categorical negation of coordinated structures 
thus contrast semantically in that categorical negation is exhaustive, 
including all possible members of an implied closed set, while unmarked 
verbal or predicate negation contains illustrative examples of an open­
ended set. 

9.6 Summary 
313 
9.6 
Summary 
Analysis of negation patterns in the four dialect regions has 
revealed that all of them utilize three basic strategies of negation: verbal, 
predicate, and categorical negation, each of which shares certain syntactic 
and pragmatic features. The two most basic negating strategies, verbal 
and predicate negation, have both unmarked and marked usages. 
Egyptian and Syrian make use of marked verbal negation in which 
verbal particles negate predicate structures. Kuwaiti seems to restrict 
marked verbal negation to the negative copula, a special form of verbai . 
negation that is marked in all dialects except Syrian. 
Some languages have a special negative form that performs the 
function of denying a presupposition or a proposition (Chinese is one, 
Li and Thompson 198 1). In the case of Arabic, it appears that the two 
basic unmarked negation strategies, verbal and predicative, share that 
function in the following manner: each is used as the marked form of 
negation for the other category. Thus, negation of verbs with the 
predicate negative /mu/, /mB/, or /ma§i/ constitutes marked negation, 
the negation of the verb phrase as a predicated proposition. Likewise, 
negation of a predicate with verbal negation, /ma/ or /m! - §/, constitutes 
marked negation, lending verbal force to participles and nominal phrases 
functioning as pseudo-verbs. 
The two dialects that use /-§/ exhibit an interesting syntactic 
divergence: while Moroccan allows a wide range of sentence components 
to be contained within the particles /ma/ and /-§/, Egyptian exhibits the 
opposite trend: /mB! is becoming increasingly inseparable into its 
component parts. The increasing frequency noted by el-Tonsi of the 
construction /mi§ + indicative imperfective/ suggests that it may 
eventually replace the normative /ma + indicative imperfective + §/, in 
the same way, probably, that /mi§ + future/ replaced /m! + future + §/ 
(a construction still prevalent in southern Egyptian dialects, see Behnstedt 
and Woidich 1985, 1994). Further evidence of this trend is found in 
Behnstedt's and Woidich's isogloss of the negation of the active participle 
with /mB! as opposed to /ma - §/ in southern Egypt; the former is used 
from Cairo to al-Minya, and the latter south of al-Minya ( 1985: 1 1 1). 
Moreover, while participles retain their verbal characteristics in Egyptian, 

314 
Negation 
they never seem to be negated verbally in Cairene Arabic, nor is the 
future. In a number of constructions, then, Cairene speakers favor 
predicate negation over verbal negation, a phenomenon which points to 
a process of historical change. 
Within the broad framework proposed here, much work remains 
to be done. The Syrian region in particular needs further syntactic and 
pragmatic study, having a number of regional variants that it has not 
been possible to examine in depth here. The complex patterns of 
negation in all areas bear watching for future developments. 

10 SENTENCE TYPOLOGY 
10.0 Introduction 
Variations in Arabic word order are often attributed to a rather 
vague "emphasis." Thus Wright says of the difference between /zaydun 
mata/ Zayd died and /mata zaydun/ died Zayd, that the former implies 
or expresses a contrast between /zayd/ and another (unnamed) person, 
whereas in the latter the "logical emphasis rests almost solely on the ' 
verb" ( 1898ii:255). 
Two problems undermine this analysis: 
in 
constructions of the former type, Zayd is not necessarily contrastive, 
and the term "logical emphasis" is too vague. A clearer explanation of 
the types of contrast and emphasis signalled by changes in word order 
will be sought here. As Ingham notes, "the term 'emphatic' is much 
abused in linguistics as a blanket term for undetermined distinctions" 
( 1994: 148).1 
In 7.2.2, it was proposed that /kant and other temporal verbs 
sometimes occupies a sentence position called topic, which will be 
defined here in greater detail. The analysis of negation in Chapter 9 
distinguished between predicate-complement and verbal negation, 
reflecting an underlying pragmatic distinction in argument structure. 
Here I will argue for a parallel distinction in sentence typology, and 
propose that sentence structure in spoken Arabic is best analyzed as 
being of two distinct, equally basic types: topic-prominent and subject­
prominent, each type having its own discourse function. 
The term topic is used here, following the literature, in two different 
senses. At the sentence level, topic is used in a technical sense to refer 
to a particular pragmatic function in a particular type of sentence structure, 
the topic-comment sentence, in which the topic position is syntactically 
defined as sentence-initial (see further 10.2). At the discourse level, 
topic refers in a non-technical sense to any one of a number of subjects 
under discussion in any given conversation. Here I use topic to mean 
sentence topic in the technical sense, while discourse topic will refer to 
the non-technical meaning of a subject under discussion. 
IAn important and welcome exception to this trend is Caubet's (1993) detailed 
functional approach to sentence typology in Moroccan Arabic.

Sentence Typology 
10.1 Sentence Typology 
Language typology, being concerned with universal laws and 
patterns, began with the study of the relative order of sentence constituents 
verb (V), subject (S), and object (0), arranged into permutations of 
SVO, VSO and others? Even though typologists themselves warn that 
not all languages can be classified according to this system (Comrie 
1 98 1  :32, 82), this taxonomy has been adopted by some Arabists as a 
construct within which Arabic may be situated. Grand'Henry (1976:85) 
and Rosenhouse ( 1984a:49), among others, have remarked that in general, 
both SVO and VSO are found in the dialects. Verb-initial sentences 
from my data include:

Verb-initial sentences that lack independently expressed subjects are 
classified here as having VSO typology. 
Several studies on modern dialects postulate a typological 
development from VSO-prominent Old Arabic or Classical Arabic to 
the SVO-prominent modern dialects. Feghali, assuming that pre-verbal 
pronoun subjects occur in the dialects more frequently than in Classical 
Arabic, explains this 'development' by means of semantic shift: Classical 
/'ana katabtuhu/ I'm the one who wrote it came eventually to mean I 
wrote it (1928:85; see also Ingham's discussion of similar statements, 
1994:38, and Fassi-Fehri 1988: 127). This purported development is 
seen as evidence of a major break between written or formal varieties 
of Arabic on one hand and spoken or informal ones on the other. 
However, no frequency studies of modern Arabic have yet been 
undertaken to either support or challenge this assumption. Both VSO 
and SVO are common enough in all varieties of Arabic to be considered 
"basic;" a thorough study of word order typology in all varieties and 
registers of Arabic would be necessary to show if or how the basic 
typologies of Arabic have changed over time. Until such a study is 
conducted, the discussion must remain limited to indirect evidence.3 
The investigation of sentence typology presented here has three 
related aims. First, evidence will be adduced in support of the claim 
that the dialects retain VSO as a basic word order. Second, it will be 
argued .that a functional approach to sentence typology that distinguishes 
between subject-oriented and topic-oriented typologies gives a more 
complete description of sentence construction in spoken Arabic than a 
structural approach that relies on subject-oriented analysis alone. Finally, 
the basic discourse functions of word order typologies characteristic of 
spoken Arabic will be examined. 
3See Khan (1988:30) for a study of word order in Classical Arabic, discussed 
in 10.1.2. 

10.1 Sentence Typology 
319 
10.1.1 Structural Evidence for the Primacy of VSO 
Arabic shares with other VSO languages a number of corollary 
typological patterns that are statistically typical of verb-initial languages. 
These patterns include the post-nominal position of adjectives and 
genitives, and the use of prepositions rather than postpositions (Croft 
1990:203). Longacre classifies languages with this typology as "strong 
VSO" types (1995:332). 
Typologists use several kinds of evidence in determining the 
markedness of alternative grammatical forms (Croft 1990:70-72). One ' 
kind of evidence they consider is the relative number of morphemes 
each one contains, assuming that-other factors notwithstanding-the 
marked structure contains as many or more morphemes in comparison 
to the unmarked (Croft 1990:73). According to this criterion, VSO 
sentences in Arabic stand unmarked with respect to SVO, because the 
latter contains two separate subject markings, one a subject marker on 
the verb, and the other the overt subject noun or pronoun. 
Relative clause structure also typically shows VSO order, 
especially indefinite relative clauses, which are almost always headed 
by a verb or pseudo-verb. Eid (1983:288) and Fassi-Fehri (1988:124-6) 
point out that definite relative clauses in Egyptian and Moroccan only 
allow an initial subject pronoun if it contrasts with another possible 
referent. Normally, relative clauses show VS order, two instances of 
which occur in this Syrian example: 
52

first thing. ---
yeah. was there-is one-m died-he father-his 
There was a [guy] whose mother died. --- His father died first. 
---
Yeah. There was a guy whose father died 
When a relative clause contains SVO order, it is usually possible 
to point to a pragmatic motivation. In the following Egyptian passage, 
the occurrence of the pronoun /hiyyal it in the second relative clause 
parallels the use of the definite relative pronoun lillil in the first, and 

320 
Sentence Typology 
may be motivated by the speaker's desire to mark the specificity of the 
indefinite noun /tamsiliyya/ seriae

she-says was-necessary-she 0 mayor? 
There's a serial that they used to show on TV that says, Is it 
really necessary, Mayor? 
10.1.2 Typological Frequency and Discourse Type 
Typologists also rely on frequency as a measure of markedness: 
if a particular construction occurs more often than an alternative one, it 
is likely to be unmarked in comparison to that alternative (Croft 1990:84-
5). However, the frequency of VSO and SVO in Arabic main clauses is 
not readily answerable, because the frequency of both typologies varies 
from text to text and from context to context. If patterns can be 
established correlating the frequency of a given word order with a 
particular type of text, it may be that Arabic has more than one basic 
word order, one for each type of discourse. 
Discourse analysts distinguish primarily between language as an 
"expression of content," which they call transactional, and language as 
expression of "social relations and personal attitudes," which they 
designate interactional (Brown and Yule 1983: 1). 
Transactional 
situations tend to be primarily information-giving, and much of the 
information is "new," in the discourse sense, whereas the discourse 
topic tends to remain constant. Narratives, which constitute one type 
of transactional language, often revolve around the actions of a particular 
entity or group. In such cases, when the discourse topic remains stable, 
one might expect VS word order to dominate. On the other hand, 
narratives also contain descriptive passages that break the recounting 
of events to focus on a particular discourse topic. In conversation, 
which is often primarily interactional, the discourse topic is likely to

10.1 Sentence Typology

shift many times, often with each change of speaker. Since people 
tend to talk about themselves, a higher percentage of independent pronoun 
subjects should also occur in this type of language. The passages in 
this section, taken from the four dialect regions, support the notion that 
word order variation varies with the type of language use. 
In the following descriptive passage, a Moroccan informant 
discusses problems caused by the influx of summer tourists into his 
quiet beachfront town. He introduces a number of discourse topics, 
/I-playal the beach, In-nasi people, and several unspecified indivḯuals, . 
referred to as /l-axurl another [person]. The passage is primarily 
descriptive rather than narrative, and SV order predominates:

The following Egyptian passage shows a clear jump from 
transactional narrative to interactional language within the narrative. 
The fIrSt four main clause verbs, /kiin/ he was, /kanu/ they were, /'al-Iaha! 
he said to her, and I'alit-Iul she said to him, are all clause-initial, and 
no independent pronoun subject appears either before or after the verb. 
However, as soon as the narrator begins to quote the actors, subject-initial 
word order predominates. The shift from VS to SV order occurs at the 
exact points at which the transactional (here, narrative) nature of the 
passage gives way to an internal, interactional dialogue (SV in bold).

The next Syrian joke shows clearly that VS order predominates 
in the narration of events. In this text, thirty main and subordinate 
clauses exhibit verb-initial order (clause-initial verbs are highlighted in 
boldface). Only seven clauses exhibit SV (or, in the case of 4, OV) 
typology: (1) constitutes a circumstantial clause (Arabic /Qal/) that 
describes a state, and has obligatory SV order, while (2), (3), (4), (5), 
and (7) indicate shifts of discourse topic from one character or set of 
characters to another. The SV word order of (6) echoes that of the 
preceding clause, (5), the repetition here being a narrative device.

how? She said, well, I did such and such and took [it] from him. 
While these few examples hardly suffice to constitute proof, a 
consistent pattern has begun to emerge. The plot-focused parts of 
narratives usually center on one or two discourse topics which vary 
little from sentence to sentence. Moreover, other discourse topics which 
SOn the use of the imperative in bedouin narrative style, see PaIva (1977). 

328 
Sentence Typology 
are introduced into the narrative must usually be introduced as new 
entities or information, and marked as such (see section 1 .5). On the 
other hand, in conversational or interactional discourse, the change of 
speaker often necessitates a change of discourse topic, since each speaker 
tends to talk about himself or herself, or the conversation moves from 
one discourse topic to another. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect 
different patterns and frequencies of word order to emerge in narrative 
texts and conversational texts. The assumption that dialects have 
normalized SVO order may be based largely on transactional, 
conversational texts in which it is natural that the topic of discourse 
would shift frequently. 
It is worth noting that Khan's study of Classical Arabic syntax 
supports this analysis. His count of SV in narrative and expository 
texts reveals a significant difference in frequency: 45 clauses out of 
550 lines of an expository text constitute SV structure, whereas an 
equivalent length of narrative text contains no SV clauses at all (1988:30).6 
If both VSO and SVO represent basic typologies, each one 
unmarked in its own context, is one context less marked than another? 
Longacre argues that "[i]f storyline clauses in narrative discourse in a 
given language are VSO, then that language should be classified as a 
VSO language" (1995:333). Whether or not he is right, VSO typology 
can be shown to be prominent in spoken Arabic narratives, and remains 
a basic word order of the language. 
Structural typology cannot take the analysis beyond this point. 
Functional typology, on the other hand, investigates not only the syntactic 
roles or- constituents, such as subject, object, and verb, but also semantic 
and pragmatic roles. Semantic roles are identified by the "logical" role 
of the .entity in the action, such as agent, patient, and receiver. Pragmatic 
roles involve the status of the information carried by a sentence 
6Khan also remarks that VSO sentences in Classical Arabic are usually headed 
by a perfective verb, and further, that SV sentences tend to be descriptive 
(1988:30). The same is true for the dialects, as our examples have shown. 
This tendency reflects a universal pattern that Hopper and Thompson (1980) 
call "transitivity," by which they mean the degree of "effectiveness" of verbal 
action as expressed not only in the verb, but in the entire clause. High 
transitivity is associated with punctual. telic verbs. object marking, and other 
features, all of which tend to co-occur in fore grounded clauses in discourse. 

10.2 Topic- and Subject-Prominent Sentence Structures 
329 
constituent as perceived by the speaker and presented to the interlocutor, 
and it is at this level that explanation will be sought for the variations 
in spoken Arabic word order. 
10.2 Topic-Prominent and Subject-Prominent Sentence Structures 
Li and Thompson challenge the "assumption ... that the basic 
sentence structure should be universally described in terms of subject, 
object, and verb" (1976: 461). They argue that in some languages, "the 
notion of topic may be as basic as that of subject" ( 1976:459): and ' 
propose a typology that classifies languages into topic-prominent, 
subject-prominent, both topic- and subject-prominent, and neither topic­
nor SUbject-prominent. According to their theory, then, some languages 
may incorporate both topic-prominent and subject-prominent structures. 
There is considerable evidence that spoken Arabic is one of these 
languages. 
Both traditional and modern analyses of Classical Arabic support 
a distinction between topic-oriented and event-oriented typologies. 
Traditional Arabic grammatical terminology separates SV and VS orders, 
called /al-jumla al-ismiyya/ noun-initial sentences and /al-jumla al­
fi'liyya/ verb-initial sentences, respectively. In sentences headed by 
nouns (not necessarily subjects), 'new information' is called /xabar/, 
usually translated as predicate, but etymologically meaning a piece of 
information, news (the subject here being called /al-mubtada>/ the primary 
or basic [partf).7 The Arabic term /xabar/ describes the predicate of 
noun-initial sentences only, whereas the terminology used for verb-initial 
sentences derives from the Arabic word for verb, /al-fi'l/ the action. 
Arabic terminology thus distinguishes between topic-prominent, given­
new information packaging,S and event-prominent, or verb-initial 
packaging. VSO word order, as seen by Arab grammarians, does not 
follow the same information packaging principles as noun-initial 
1The tenn /mubtada'/ starting point echoes a metaphor used by psycholinguists 
Gernsbacher and Hargreaves for the process of cognitive processing: first, 
"laying a foundation," then "mapping" information onto it (cited by Payne 
1995:450). 
8Given-new, also called theme-rheme, refers to the linear order of presentation 
of information in a sentence. Given (old, known, or shared) infonnation 
leads, and new infonnation follows (Chafe 1976). 

330 
Sentence Typology 
sentences. Moreover, Khan points to a syntactic and distributional 
congruence between SV word order and topic-prominent infonnation 
packaging in Classical Arabic texts ( 1988:29-30). He lists a number of 
specific discourse functions of SV word order in Classical Arabic, 
which show a high degree of correspondence to Li and Thompson's 
topic-prominent functions (Khan 1988:32-40; see further 10.2. 1). 
It is well-known that topic-comment structure commonly occurs 
in spoken Arabic. However, discussions of topic-comment structure 
(e.g., Harrell 1962: 160-61 ,  Cowell 1964:429) tend to focus on sentences 
with fronted or dislocated nouns, such as Ahmad, I know (him). The 
view taken here holds all SV sentences, not merely those with explicit 
topics distinct from subjects, to be topic-prominent. 
Li and Thompson's approach to sentence typology thus provides 
a powerful theory of sentence typology in Arabic, one that coincides 
with analyses of other varieties of the language, and helps to account 
for the motivations behind the patterns of both noun-initial and verb­
initial typologies in different environments. 
10.2.1 Spoken Arabic as a Topic-Prominent Language 
Li and Thompson list a number of characteristics which, taken 
together, tend to characterize topic-prominent languages (1976:461-64). 
These characteristics include: (1) the topic is syntactically distinct 
from the subject, and the verb agrees with the subject but not the topic; 
(2) sentence construction with dummy subjects tend not to occur in 
topic-prominent languages; and (3) topic-prominent languages tend to 
make limited and/or specialized use of passive constructions. Examples 
from the dialects will show that spoken Arabic shares these properties 
with other topic-prominent languages (but in the case of the passive, 
only partly SO).9 
The topic position in Arabic is sentence-initial, as it is in other 
topic-prominent languages. Since subjects may also be sentence-initial, 
9However, Li and Thompson also list other properties which are not shared 
by Arabic, among them that topic-prominent languages tend to be verb-final 
(1976:490). The fact that Arabic shares some properties but not others, and . 
some properties to a greater extent than others, may perhaps be explained by 
the fact that Arabic incorporates both topic-prominent and subject-prominent 
typologies. 

10.2 Topic- and Subject-Prominent Sentence Structures 
331 
a noun in that position sometimes fulfills two roles at once, that of 
grammatical subject, and that of pragmatic topic. However, many 
sentences contain sentence-initial topics that do not fill the syntactic 
role of subject. 
The following examples contain sentence-initial nouns that are 
topics, but not subjects. In the first, the topic, /martu/ his wife, cannot 
be the subject of the main verb, /h::lrbu/ they fled.

In the next passage, the two topics, /I-(a'ila/ the family and /I-(azri/ the

The speaker in the following passage is a female addressing a 
group of women and pointing to her husband, the only male present. 
The masculine gender of /(arif/ he knows clearly does not agree with 
the sentence-initial pronoun pana/ I. The only plausible grammatical 
analysis, then, is that Pana/ 1 represents the sentence topic, whereas the 
unexpressed subject of the main clause, he, is indicated by the masculine 
singular gender of /(arif/ he knows.

Topics must be definite; subjects, on the other hand, may be 
either definite or indefinite. Arabic sentences follow this principle by 
definition: in formal Arabic, syntactic restrictions prohibit sentence­
initial indefinite subjects, and in spoken Arabic, they are rare. 
Among Li and Thompson's criteria for topic-prominence is that 
the "verb determines subject but not topic" ( 1976:462). In the following 
sentences, the topics do not fulfill subject roles, and in some cases, the 
sentence-initial topic has no syntactic referent in the sentence it heads. 
The topic of the first sentence, /d-drari Ò-Ògar/ little kids, is plural, and 
as such_, has no syntactic relationship to the main clause, although it 
does have an obvious semantic one, in that the masculine singular 
pronouns in to him and he says refer to a kid.

the rest of the sentence:

clothing of-the-winter. only 
In the old days, we, I swear! the woman [had} the summer outfit 
and the winter outfit. That's all. 
The dialects share with other topic-prominent languages the 
absence of dummy subject constructions (Li and Thompson 1976:467). 
Dummy subjects function as place-holders for an empty syntactic subject 
position, such as English It in sentences like It's snowing. Spoken 
Arabic does not require a dummy subject, as the following examples 
show: 
10 
(<The Egyptian pronoun /huwwa/ he, it in sentences such as /huwwa I-'ustaz 
rna gM.?/ Didn't the teacher come? is not a true dummy pronoun but rather 
functions as an interrogative particle that signals a presupposition on the part 
of the speaker. For a discussion of the functions of this pronoun, see Eid 
(1992).

Lastly, Li and Thompson note that topic-prominent languages 
often do not have a passive voice, or have passives with special meanings 
( 1976:467), While the passive voice occurs in spoken Arabic, in many 
cases, speakers prefer a topicalized construction using a dummy subject

Ingham recognizes the similarity of Arabic sentence patterns to 
Li and Thompson's description of topic-prominent languages, but stops 
short of recognizing Arabic as a topic-prominent language because of 
Li and Thompson's claim that the topic is not syntactically related to 
the rest of the sentence (Ingham 1994:36). However, Li and Thompson's 
analysis is based largely on Chinese, the structure of which differs 
from that of Arabic in important ways, including the fact that Chinese 
is a low anaphoric language that makes limited use of referent pronouns 
(Li 1997). Arabic, on the other hand, is a high anaphoric language that 
requires a high degree of reference among various sentences parts 
signalled by referent or resumptive pronouns. To my knowledge, it has 
not been established that topic-prominent sentence structure requires a

may not be specifically Kuwaiti. 

336 
Sentence Typology 
low degree of anaphoric reference, or that a language with a high 
frequency of anaphoric pronouns cannot be a topic-prominent language. 
Even so, it is not difficult to find examples of topic-prominent sentences 
in which the topic has no direct syntactic relationship with the rest of 
the sentence. In addition to the Moroccan and Kuwaiti examples cited 
above, Cowell's Syrian examples include (1964:429):

[For] me, the age of adventures was between 17 and20 
A final piece of evidence supporting the analysis of SV sentences 
as topic-prominent is found in a situation in which a Kuwaiti speaker 
catches herself and "corrects" a misstep. The speaker describes here 
how she goes about making contact between the two families when 
trying to arrange a marriage. Several people are involved: the prospective 
bride and groom and both of their mothers, in addition to the matchmaker 
herself. The speaker first structures the sentence VSO, then changes 
her mind about the information packaging, ostensibly because the number 
of participants involved may cause confusion about the narrative. The 
speaker "corrects" the original VS word order, /tirja' tigul-li umm 1;)­
bnayya/ to SV /umm l;)-bnayya tirja' tigul-li/ the girl's mother comes 
back and says to me, clarifying the topic of the sentence:

Umm Ahmad. We give her [the information] and tell her. She 
says, the girl's mother comes back and tells me, the girl's mother 
comes back and tells me, Umm Ahmad, do you know him? 
Spoken Arabic thus shares several features with the topic-
prominent languages Li and Thompson describe. The following sections 
explore the functions of sentence topic as Chafe (1976) defines it. 
10.2.2 Temporal Frame as Topic 
The sentence position of topic is difficult to define beyond a 
rather vague "what the sentence is about,"12 but Chafe identifies the 
function of the topic as establishing "a spatial, temporal, or individual 
framework within which the main predication holds" (1976:50-5 1, 
emphasis mine). Many examples cited in the previous section contain 
topics that establish an individual framework for their sentences. This 
section will explore Chafe's concept of temporal framework as it is 
syntactically realized in spoken Arabic. 
In 7.2.2, I argued that temporal verbs, especially /kfm/ to be, can 
be topicaiized, on the basis that they sometimes lie outside the main 
clause, showing no direct syntactic relationship to it. Examples cited 
therein contain the verbs /kan/ to be and Syrian /,:!ar/ to become with 
subject agreement differing from that of the main verb. Moreover, 
temporal frames as sentence topics are not limited to infonnal registers 
of Arabic. Khan's study of extraposition in Classical Arabic contains a 
number of examples similar to the ones cited in 7.2.2, such as the 
following, in which the temporal verbs /kanat/ was and /'a':!bal:ttu/ I 
became in the morning precede the perfective particle /qad/, which 
heads the verb phrase it modifies (Khan 1988:9): 
12See Tomlin (1995) for criticism of the vagueness of the term topic.

CA ઎ -=.L. .u .-., 0'.01

It is interesting to note that these Classical examples, and several 
additional ones from the Syrian region in particular, contain topics that 
combine both a temporal frame and an individual one. Of Khan's 
examples, the topic in the first consists of the phrase /kanat il-yahiid/ 
the Jews were, and in the second, /'aÄba\:ltu/ I became in the morning. 
Parallel examples from Syrian include the following pair. In the 
frrst example, the use of feminine /Äarit/ she became rather than masculine 
/Äar/ is unusual in two respects. First, this syntactic structure, in which 
the syntactic subject is indefinite and sentence-final, normally attracts a 
masculine verb. Second, the syntactic subject of the clause is masculine 
singular, /mantiiZ/ that which is produced. What motivates the speaker 
to use /Äarit/ rather than /Äar/? I believe it is to give the sentence a 
topical frame with both temporal and individual referents: the change 
in circumstances signalled by the verb it became, and the generic educated 
young woman, she.

Now, when she is educated and so forth and she has come to be 
productive and she goes out and workS 
Similarly, in the second sentence of the following passage, the verb 
/kanit/ she was contains both temporal and individual topic frames, 
past time reference and she, in reference to /l-maÃċa/ the "dressing

This "dressing woman" [was) a woman who used to work in the 
bathhouse ... In the old days they used to bring her to her [the 
bride] to henna her legs for her 
I have heard similar patterns in Egypt, though infrequently. In 
the following example, the syntactic structure of the sentence should 
trigger a neutralized, masculine singular verb /kan / it was. Instead, the 
verb /kanl is conjugated for person, providing a topic that combines 
both past time reference and person. 
E5 
ul rj'i Ŷ 
kunt lazim aG[ifu 
was-I necessary I-see"him 
I had to see him (elicited) 
These examples, and those cited in 7.2.2, show that temporal 
verbs can function to set a topic frame for sentences in two ways, 
either as a temporal frame alone, or, when conjugated for person, as a 
temporal and individual topic frame. 
10.2.3 Topical Circumstantial Clauses (/.,311) 
Using Chafe's definition of topic as a "spatial, temporal, or 
individual framework within which the predication holds" (1976:50-51), 
I have claimed that topic in Arabic includes nouns and temporal verbs. 
Adverbs, too, often occur sentence-initial position, in which case their 
function in providing a frame for the sentence fits in with Chafe's 
definition of the function of sentence topic. The ordering of information 
in a sentence such that topical elements are sentence-initial, and new 
information sentence-final, can apply not only to the main clause 
constituents subject, verb, and object, but also to adverbial clauses, 

340 
Sentence Typology 
including the large and heterogeneous Arabic class called circumstantial 
clauses (/al-jumla al-J:Ialiyya/). 
As defined in formal Arabic, circumstantial clauses "describe the 
state or condition" of a main sentence subject or object (Wright II:330). 
Circumstantial clauses may be syndetic, signalled by /wa/ (literally 
and), or asyndetic.13 In discussing circumstantial clauses in Syrian, 
Cowell places more emphasis on the temporal nature of these clauses 
than on their descriptive nature ( 1 964:531). Rosenhouse notes that 
circumstantial clauses in the dialects (unlike in formal Arabic) may 
precede the main clause. She attributes this difference to a vaguely 
defined semantic shift: in the dialects, "there is a heavier stress put on 
the subordinate part, so that it becomes as important (psychologically) 
as the main clause" and is "more deeply connected" to the sentence 
(1978:229). A more precise linguistic description for the sentence-initial 
position of these clauses is "frame-setting," or topicality. 
When 
circumstantial clauses occur in sentence-initial position, they function 
to give a temporal and descriptive frame within which the action of the 
main verb takes place. 
The following Egyptian example demonstrates this point. The 
clause /w':J humma mas yin/ while they were leaving, provides the 
situational frame within which the focused event, forgetting the bag, 
takes place. 
E6 
LA LA_04..:J 
••. ..w. य़ ૷L.. r-J 
, . i 
'ah, W':J humma mas yin nisi santitu m'aha 
Oh, and they leaving forgot-he bag-his with-her 
Oh yeah, when they were leaving he forgot his briefcase with her 
. 
T-wo examples from Morocco contrast the topicality of the 
circumstantial clause in sentence-initial position with the focus of new 
information of the sentence-final position. The first example sets up 
the frame, /w }:Ina !al'in/ as we were going up, for the important event, 
seeing Khadija. In the second, the temporal frame is provided by the 
adverb /yumayn/ two days, while the circumstantial clause provides 
new information, that he was angry. 
13For an extensive description of circumstantial clause structures in Egyptian 
Arabic, see Woidich (1991).

341 
A major variation in the structure of the circumstantial clause 
occurs in Syrian speech. In this variation, the subject of the circumstantial 
clause may be extraposed, or fronted, resulting in a topical pronoun 
subject followed by a topical circumstantial clause headed by Iw-I and. 
It is significant that the extraposed subjects consist of highly individuated 
personal pronouns, suggesting that the highly individuated nature of 
the subject attracts this kind of syntactic movement, lending it syntactic 
and pragmatic prominence. The following examples show extraposed 
I'intl you and I'anal I heading their respective clauses. While each 
clause as a whole provides a topical frame for the following sentence, 
the pronoun subject plays a special role in linking the two: 
S

he-to-me] 
While I was coming and carrying it on my chest, he up and told 
me .. . (Grotzfeld 1965: 101, translation mine) 
This pattern does not seem to occur regularly in other dialects, 
although a sentence-final circumstantial clause with subject fronting 
/l:tna wu rgayyarIn/ when we were young occurs in a text from Upper 
Egypt (Behnstedt and W oidich 1988iii:264, translation mine):

10. 3 Variation in Word Order: Information Packaging 
The previous sections have demonstrated that both VS and SV 
typologies are well established in the dialects. However, these two 
word orders do not account for all sentence typologies found in spoken 
Arabic. Even a relatively small body of data is sufficient to show that 
almost any basic constituent may begin an Arabic sentence, even, at 
times, an indefinite predicate. These non-VS, non-SV types of sentences 
represent marked forms of topic-prominent or subject-prominent 
sentences. 
Discourse theory on information packaging helps explain the range 
of word order typologies in spoken Arabic, because it proposes principles 
that speakers use to present information in a way accessible to their 
interlocutors. Chafe summarizes "packaging phenomena" that affect 
way nouns are presented in discourse (1976:28): 
(a) the noun may be either given or new; (b) it may be afocus of 
contrast, (c) it may be definite or indefinite; (d) it may be the 
subject of its sentence; (e) it may be the topic of its sentence; and 
(0 it may represent the individual whose point of view the speaker 
is taking, or with whom the speaker empathizes. 
The remainder of this chapter will explore the ways in which these 
features affect sentence structure in spoken Arabic. I will add to the 
ones Chafe lists a function that may be syntactically expressed in Syrian 
dialects, one that I will call resumptive topic. 
By resumptive topic, I 
mean a topic that the speaker assumes is known to the interlocutor, but 
that the former believes needs to be recalled or resumed. A resumptive 
topic is not new, but is often in some sense unexpected, hence its 
position is sentence-final (also called "right-dislocated"). 
It was noted previously that topics must be chosen from information 
that is given, that is, entities that can be assumed by the speaker to be 
known to his or her interlocutor, whether because they belong to the 

10.3 Variation in Word Order: Information Packaging 
343 
permanent registry (meaning that they are universally known), or because 
they are present in the conversational registry (meaning that they have 
been mentioned or alluded to in the conversation at hand, Chafe 1976:26). 
One of the main organizing principles of information packaging is that 
new information tends to follow old information. Thus new information, 
expressed by an indefinite noun or predicate, tends to gravitate toward 
the end of a sentence or clause. Formal Arabic syntax adheres closely 
to this discourse principle: the normal word order for a copulative 
sentence with an indefinite subject (/mubtada'/) is predicate-subject 
(/xabar muqaddam/), indicating a strong propensity against an indefinite 
noun assuming a place at the head of a sentence. 
It is important to distinguish Chafe's "focus of contrast" from 
another kind of focus, focus of new information. Nouns that represent 
focus of contrast do not constitute new information, since only known 
entities can be contrasted. Moreover, unlike new information, which 
occupies sentence-final position, the focus of contrast does not have 
one definable sentence position, because it occupies a marked position 
with respect to its normal, unmarked one. I will show that, in YSO 
typology, the unmarked position of object is post-verbal, whereas objects 
that are contrastive may occupy pre-verbal position (OYS). Subjects 
that are contrastive, on the other hand, can occupy clause-fmal position 
(YOS). 
The following sections investigate the information packaging 
strategies of various marked word orders and nominal marking that 
occur in spoken Arabic. The discussion will begin with subject-initial 
structures, then tum to object-initial sentences, and finally, consider 
two object marking strategies that fulfill specific pragmatic roles. 
10.3.1 Right-Dislocated Subjects: New Information 
Among the common word order typologies in Arabic is the right­
dislocation (moving to the end of the sentence) of indefinite subjects, 
resulting in YOS word order. These indefmite subjects cannot function 
as topics, because their sentence-fmal position signals that they contain 
new information. In the following Egyptian and Kuwaiti examples, the 
indefinite subjects lie as close as possible to the end of their sentences, 
allowing the indefinite subjects to be focused as new information:

10.3.2 Pronoun Subject Position 
In spoken Arabic, the pronoun subject of a verb is obligatorily 
marked on the verb as a prefix, suffix, or circumfix, indicating gender 
and/or number. An independent pronominal subject may be optionally 
expressed as an additional subject marker in verbal sentences. The 
position of this independent pronoun subject vis-a-vis the verb is also 
variable, since it may precede the verb or follow it. 
The various 
combinations of these two options result in three possible cases: (a) no 
independent pronoun appears, (b) an independent pronoun precedes the 
verb, and (c) an independent pronoun follows the verb. These three 
cases all have quite specific pragmatic functions. 
No independent pronoun subject is expressed in cases where the 
discourse topic remains stable. The following exchange is taken from 
a conversation about a /tayyer/ woman 's suit that speaker E1 had bought 
and then taken to the cleaner. There are a number of places in which 
thː subject pronoun /huwwa/ he, referring to the suit, could be inserted 
in this conversation. The fact that this subject pronoun does not occur 
in this passage reflects the fact that the discourse topic has not changed, 
and in the absence of a change of topic, no pronoun is necessary.

Similarly, the next Moroccan example contains only two subject 
pronouns, and both occur at the point of topic switches, marked as ( 1) 
and (2) in the text. (1) /huwwa/ he occurs when the topic changes from 
the husband, the subject of the verb /rifzt/ he sent, to /l-'abd/ the slave; 
(2) /hiyya/ she appears at the topic switch from the slave (him) to the 
wife (her). In contrast, the second mention of the wife has no pronoun, 
because she remains the discourse topic.

When an independent subject pronoun occurs, it may precede or 
follow the verb, and the speaker's choice of sentence position reflects 
the pragmatic role of the pronoun in the information structure of the 

346 
Sentence Typology 
sentence. A pre-verbal independent pronoun subject fulfills a different 
pragmatic role than a post-verbal subject. In the former case, the 
underlying SV sentence typology is topic-prominent, and the pronoun 
fulfills the role of topic. In the latter case, the VOS typology represents 
a marked form of subject-prominent or VSO typology, and the pronoun 
usually acts as a focus of contrast, such as a contrast in expectations, or 
the sudden, unexpected (re)appearance of a known entity. 
Examples from all four dialects document the focus of contrast 
signalled by VOS typology with pronoun subject. In the first passage, 
the post-verbal pronoun subject signals a contrast between the older 
generation, whose marriages were arranged, and the young generation 
nowadays, who arrange their marriages /hinnin/ they (themselves).

The following Egyptian sentence is taken from a narrative of a 
movie plot. The speaker has just reported an ominous dialogue between 
the two main characters, a man and a woman, and now describes the 
ensuing events. When the discourse topic shifts from the man to the

contrast his actions to hers:

scale, then stipulates that the customers-not she and her partner-decide 
how much they will pay. The post-verbal repetition of the subject

In the next example, the post-verbal /'ana/ I singles out the 
Moroccan speaker, creating a contrastive distance between him and a 
situation he wants nothing to do with:

w-as bgiti ndic lzk 'ana? 
and-what wanted-you I-do for-you I? 
What do you want me to do for you? 
Another form of contrastive focus is the indication of 
unexpectedness or surprise. The immediately preceding Moroccan 

348 
Sentence Typology 
example hints at unexpectedness as well as contrastive distance, giving 
a sense of astonishment: You want me to do something? This kind of 
focus of contrast indicates surprise on the part of the speaker. The 
post-verbal pronoun in the following Syrian example likewise indicates 
both a contrast between I'anal I and I'intul you, and astonishment on 
the part of the speaker at her neighbors' unexpected visit:

now how came-you-p you-p?! 
Imagine, I would be sitting in the morning, there would be a 
knock at the door, now, how did you get here?! 
It may therefore be claimed that the occurrence and position of 
independently-expressed pronoun subjects is variable in spoken Arabic, 
according to the informational role played by the subject: a pre-verbal 
pronoun subject serves mainly as a sentence topic, which I argue is 
grammaticalized in Arabic, while a post-verbal pronoun subject supplies 
either contrastive or unexpected reference. 
10.3.3 Object-Initial Sentences 
Object-initial sentences consist of two types, one a marked form 
of topic-prominent sentence structure, and the other a marked form of 
subject-prominent structure. These two types differ syntactically in 
that the topic-prominent type contains a place-holding or resumptive 
pJ'onoДin that marks the original post-verbal position of the object. The 
fronted object in this case functions like other topics, to set the frame 
for the rest of the sentence. By contrast, sentence-initial objects in the 
latter type leave behind no trace pronoun. This difference in syntactic 
structure seems to parallel a difference in pragmatic function: while 
objects that have resumptive pronouns are topical. objects without 
resumptive pronouns are highly contrastive. Examples of both types 
are examined in the next two sections.

10.3.3.1 Topic-prominent OV: Object as Topic 
A large percentage of object-initial sentences show topic-comment 
structure; that is, the object is fronted, or moved to the sentence-initial 
position, and a resumptive pronoun marks its original place in the 
sentence. The sentence-initial position of the object in this case marks 
the syntactic object as taking the role of sentential topic. These examples 
contain objects as topics, all of them functioning as the frame for the 
rest of the sentence:

10.3.3.2 Subject-Prominent OV: Contrastive Function 
In contrast to the preceding topic-prominent, object-initial 
sentences, the following sentences are subject-prominent, object-initial. 
They show object extraposition or fronting, not topicalization, as 
demonstrated by the absence of a resumptive pronoun marking the 
object position after the verb. They also exhibit a clear contrastive 
function not present in topic-prominent sentences.

Cowell calls this construction object-verb inversion, remarking that it 
occurs in "certain kinds of exclamations with the elative" (1964:439).

The next passage, from Kuwait, mentions two groups of girls, one with 
fair complexions and one with dark complexions. In the second sentence, 
the speaker singles out dark complexioned girls as being less desirable 
as brides, fronting the object /is-sumur/ dark-skinned ones:

These days, they always want light-skinned [girls), they don't 
want dark-skinned ones. Very dark-skinned they don't want 
This kind of variation in word order further supports the distinction 
between topic-prominent and sUbject-prominent sentence structures, 
because object-fronting and subject extraposition perform different 
pragmatic functions. When the syntactic object is fronted without a 
resumptive pronoun, its function is contrastive, whereas a fronted object 
in topic-comment structure plays the role of non-contrastive sentence 
topic. Similarly, pre-verbal pronoun subjects are topical, while post­
verbal pronoun subjects are contrastive. For both subjects and objects, 
then, a reversal from unmarked to marked word order parallels a shift 
in function. 

352 
Sentence Typology 
10.3.4 Predicate-Subject Inversion 
Predicate-subject inversion falls under the rubric of topic­
prominent typology. This inversion can be either marked or unmarked, 
depending in part on the relative "weight" of the constituents. Inversion 
is common when the sentence consists of a short predicate and a sentential 
subject, and follows Hawkins' (1994) "heaviness principle:" that longer 
or morphologically 'heavier' constituents tend to follow shorter or 
morphologically 'lighter' ones. At the same time, fronted predicates do 
not represent new infonnation, but rather topics, or frames within which 
the subject clauses are to be assessed. Moroccan, Egyptian, and Syrian 
examples of predicate fronting include: 
MlO J.:J I ... ILA ऻ़ wऽ.J-. L.

I˗ other contexts, inverted predicate-subject order may fulfill a 
contrastive function, as suggested by the following Moroccan example. 
The in'ierted order here signals the denial of a tacit assumption (projected 
by the speaker onto her listeners) that there no longer remain true 
believers. In this sentence, stress falls on the inverted predicate, indicating 
a contrastive function (unmarked order here would be /l-mUminm baqym/ 
(the) believers remain, in which believers would function as topic): 
M9 
.,.11 4 .,.11 4 'i

no remaining-p the-believers remaining-p the-believers

10.4 Syrian Object-Marker /la-I: Resumptive Topic 
353 
Inverted predicate-subject structure occurs with some frequency 
in Syrian speech. Cowell calls it predicate-subject inversion, and notes 
that the inversion 
gives the impression that the subject was at first suppressed (to 
be "understood" from context), then restored later as an 
afterthought. Its effect is to put relatively more emphasis on the 
predicate, less on the subject (1964:419). 
Cowell's definition indicates that these inverted subjects contain given, 
not new, information. 
In normal, topic-initial word order, thesC? 
"subjects" would constitute the topics as well. The inversion of the 
word order functions to reinvoke or resume a topic that is given but not 
active, not present in the immediate discourse registry-Cowell's 
"afterthought." It is also worth noting that my narrative data contain 
no examples of this construction, and that all of Cowell's examples are 
interactional in genre, among them (1964:419):

This particular resumptive function of inverted predicate-subject 
word order, well-documented for Syrian, parallels in function another 
"resumptive topic" construction involving the Syrian object-marker /la-I, 
examined in the next section. 
10.4 Syrian Object-Marker /Ia-/: Resumptive Topi24 
Of the four dialect areas under investigation here, the Syrian 
region is distinguished by use of the preposition /la-I to mark certain 
right-dislocated objects (objects shifted to sentence-fmal position). This 
construction contains a resumptive or place-holding pronoun marking 
the syntactic position from which the marked object has been dislocated. 
14As a preposition, /la-/ has another meaning, to, direction toward. Here I am 
concerned only with /la-/ as an object-marker. 

354 
Sentence Typology 
In such clauses, the verb phrase contains an object pronoun, which is 
then followed by a coreferent full noun object complement marked 
with Ila-I. In the bedouin joke (excerpt repeated here from 1 .5), the 
verb I'fill he said is followed first by a pronoun object Ilul to him, then 
followed by the same object component, expressed this time as a full 
noun marked with /la-I, /la-l-garsonl to the waiter. The waiter here is a 
known entity, because his existence can be inferred from that of /l-mararn/ 
the restaurant. Hence he does not represent a new topic, but rather one 
that is recalled into active registry. In addition, Ila-I assigns the waiter 
discourse topic (but not sentence topic) status, and alerts the listener to 
the fact that the waiter plays an important role in the joke. 
S2

there-is one bedouin entered-he into the-restaurant said-he-to-him 
la-the waiter, give-me ice-cream 
There was a bedouin who went into a restaurant and said to the 
waiter, Give me some ice cream 
Since this /la-I can mark both direct and indirect objects (a combination 
only possible in this particular case), its function must be both syntactic 
and pragmatic. 
Cowell designates this construction as topic-comment inversion, 
and remarks that Ila-I often marks human inverted topics (1964:434-5). 
Khan (1984) reviews this construction in Semitic, and concludes that it 
marks individuated nouns only. Levin (1987) observes that this "defmite 
object marker" occurs in contexts with an emphasis or emotional content, 
such as wonder, impatience, or disapproval. What is the motivation for 
the inverted word order? And why should there be an emotional content 
associated with this construction? 
Objects marked with /la-I are always definite, representing given 
rather than new information. In the following, the speaker must assume 
that his interlocutor knows Muhammed: 
S3 
'i("D' ǵ Ƕ  
8iftu la-mryammad ii-yom? 
saw-you-him la-Muhammed today? 
Did you see Muhammed today? 

10.4 Syrian Object-Marker 110-1: Resumptive Topic 
355 
Since /la-/ marks highly individuated entities, it functions neither 
as a new topic, nor a contrastive topic marker. Rather, this kind of 
object marking fulfills a specific pragmatic function of recalling or 
reinvoking a topic into active registry. In doing so, the speaker assumes 
that the listener knows the topic and can identify the specific referent, 
but feels the need to reinvoke the topic, perhaps because it has not been 
active in the conversational registry, or perhaps because the speaker 
believes that the interlocutor has forgotten about it. In the immediately 
preceding example, the speaker assumes that Muhammed is not present 
in the interlocutor's active conversational registry, and therefore needs 
to be reinvoked. This phrasing may be contrasted with another equally 
possible construction that signals the speaker's belief that Muhammad 
is still within active discourse registry: 
S 
srt I
J..t..a..,o u 
Gift ml}.ammad ii-yom? 
saw-you Muhammad today? 
Did you see Muhammad today? (elicited) 
Cowell's designation of this construction as an inverted topic­
comment does not match the function of /la-/ as it occurs in my data. 
This type of construction is typically found in narratives with verbs 
that take two object complements, such as j>iiV to say and /,aƠa/ to give, 
in which /la-/ usually occurs in subject-prominent VSO typology (not 
topic-prominent typology). The tendency of /la-/ to occur in narrative 
contexts is a natural consequence of its pragmatic function. /la-/ marks 
highly individuated topics in general, often human beings, or entities 
with textual prominence, which often constitute discourse topics. Since 
subject-prominent typology normally focuses on events, the speaker 
needs pragmatic and syntactic help in managing discourse topics 
(discourse topic contrasting with sentence topic). 
The following joke demonstrates another dimension of the recall 
or resumptive (discourse) topic-marking function of /la-/. 
After 
introducing the main characters, /t-tUme/ the garlic and /1A:Jbse/ the 
watermelon in the first sentence, the speaker reinvokes them in the 
second, in this case not because they have been forgotten, but to specify 
their respective roles as addresser and addressee. Here, /la-/ marks 

356 
Sentence Typology 
both the indirect object position of /HUme/ the garlic and also its status 
as discourse topic.

The emotional content noted by Levin in his study of Palestinian 
Arabic can be seen as a natural consequence of the recall. Levin points 
out that teachers use this construction to reprimand students who have 
apparently not done their homework. By "recalling" the book, the 
teacher signals that the student has forgotten about the book-or perhaps, 
sarcastically, that he or she has pretended to forget about it-as his 
example shows (1987:35; translation mine): 
p 
× ,-:-,t.:&J ּ ..:..:.I 
inti fataúto la-I-ktab? 
you opened-you-it la-the-book? 
Did you [even] open the book?! 
Levin observes that some speakers also use this construction to express 
"sorrow and pity" ( 1987:34-5). In this example, the speaker's "recall" 
of the tree to the attention of the children indicates that they have 

10.4 Syrian Object-Marker /la-I: Resumptive Topic 
357 
indeed forgotten about it, hence their destructive behavior toward it:

inzalu! kassarruha la-G-GaZara! 
get-down-p! broke-you-it Ja-the-tree!

This and similar instances of resumptive topic parallel in form and 
function the ethical dative, whose function is to provide the means to 
express a point of view other than the speaker's (see further 10.5) 
Two unusual cases of /la-/ from my data, apparent performance 
errors, further clarify the pragmatic functions of resumptive /la-I. The 
first passage, about a party given by the wife of the president of the 
university, contains a rather complex clause containing /la-I marking 
the subject of the subordinate clause, a syntactic error. Although this 
construction has been judged by a native informant to be a performance 
error, it offers a unique perspective on the pragmatic function of this 
construction. The president's Wife is highly individuated (definite, 
specific, textually prominent, and has high social status), and this 
prominence is one reason for the attraction of /la-I. The second reason 
has to do with the speaker's desire to reinvoke or recall the topic of the 
president's wife, which has been superseded in the immediately preceding 
clause by other events (see full text in Appendix 2). The resumptive 
function of II a-I, together with the highly individuated status of the 
president's wife, have taken momentary precedence over its syntactic 
restrictions:

The second unusual case contains an OVS structure with a clause­
initial /la-/ phrase, /la-toni/ Tony: 
S2 
¥I L. DT ¦I .,J§ ¨t...:.JI .w.J I©I 
jZ(i la-'and iQ-Qabit xabbru 'innu la-toni matit 'immu 
came-they to-at the-officer informed-they-him comp la-Tony died­
she mother-his 
They came to the officer and informed him that Tony's mother 
had died 
The importance of this particular example lies in the sentence-initial 
position of /la-toni/ Tony'S. /Normally, la-/ occurs in or near sentence­
final position (hence Cowell's identification of it as an inverted comment­
topic construction). A Lebanese informant finds this sentence unusual 
because of the fronted position of /la-toni/, preferring instead /matit 
'immu la-toni/ Tony's mother died. If indeed it constitutes a performance 
error, what prompted the shift in the normal word order? 
The answer may lie in conflicting information packaging needs 
on two different narrative levels. First, the speaker is telling the joke to 
an audience, and she must package the information in a way accessible 
to them. Tony is the main topic in this joke, and as such, the speaker 
wants to organize the sentence around him. On the other hand, the 
narrative logic within the joke has a different organizing imperative 
involving the speakers within the text. These speakers (they in the 
t({xt) Їeed to package Tony as a resumptive topic for the officer in 
charge, because Tony is an entity in the officer's permanent registry, 
but in need of recall. The two packaging imperatives clashed, resulting 
in the unusual word order of a fronted /la-/ phrase. 
In addition to its object-marking function, then, /la-/ acts as an 
information packaging device that recalls or reinvokes a highly 
individuated entity from either the permanent or the conversational 
registry into discourse topic. Syrian Arabic thus stands unique among 
these dialects in possessing a syntactic means to mark resumptive topics. 

10.5 The Ethical Dative: Point of View and Empathy 
359 
10.5 The Ethical Dative: Point of View and Empathy 
The final pragmatic consideration Chafe lists as relevant to the 
packaging of nouns is that of point of view or empathy (cited in 10.3). 
All four dialect areas under investigation here make use of a syntactic 
feature, called the "ethical dative," whose function it is to highlight a 
certain point of view, indicate the speaker's empathy, or elicit empathy 
on the part of the hearer. Mitchell and El-Hassan, in their study of 
educated spoken Arabic of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, note the 
widespread use of this construction in Egypt and the Levant (1994:107-9}. 
The term ethical dative is commonly used to refer to prepositional 
phrases headed by /l(i)-I that are not complements, but rather indicate 
some sort of involvement of the marked person(s). Cowell's defmition 
of it as indicating "an assumed relevance or interest of the statement" 
to involved parties explains one aspect of this function (Cowell 
1964:483). A more precise statement of the function of this dative 
replaces "assumed" with "invoked," because the speaker controls and 
exploits this device. Rather than indicating "assumed relevance or 
interest," the ethical dative reflects the speaker's attempt to invoke the 
relevance of the statement by indicating a particular point of view and 
eliciting the listener's empathy.\.5 Examples of this construction in all 
four dialects demonstrate its function (dative constructions in boldface). 
The fIrst example, from Morocco, contains the speaker's expression 
of empathy for the victim and his invoking of the listener's empathy as 
well. Here /luI for him obviously does not imply that the victim's face 
was broken at his request or for his benefit, but that it happened to the 
victim. The use of /la-/ here invokes the victim's point of view, and by

10.6 Summary 
I have argued in this chapter that the sentence structure of spoken 
Arabic retains both VSO and SVO word orders as basic typologies. 
These two typologies fulfill different discourse functions, and tend to 
predominate in different discourse genres. Using the framework of Li 
and Thompson (1976) and evidence from the dialects, I proposed that 
Arabic be classified as a language with both subject-prominent and 
topic-prominent typologies, the former associated with VSO typology 
and the latter with SVO. VSO represents the dominant typology in 
event narration, while SVO functions as a topic-prominent typology 
that is used to describe and converse, contexts in which discourse 
topics either shift around, or are taken as a frame within which a main 
sentence predication holds. 
Beyond the two basic typologies, a number of marked sentence 
structures, such as OVS, VOS, and predicate-subject (verbless), were 
also examined, with the goal of identifying their pragmatic functions. 
Adopting Chafe's types of information packaging, and adding to them 
resumptive topic, a function found in Syrian, I found that the inversion 
of unmarked word orders often results in either a focus of contrast or 
one of several kinds of topicalization (new topic, contrastive topic, or 

362 
Sentence Typology 
resumptive topic). Thus object-initial word orders, inverted from the 
nonnal object-final VSO, indicate a contrastive topic or contrastive 
focus. Subject pronouns in post-verb position fulfill a different function 
than pre-verbal subject pronouns: the former represent a focus of 
contrast, while the latter represent (non-contrastive) sentence topics. 
The four dialects examined here all appear to share these 
infonnation packaging strategies. They also share a construction called 
the ethical dative, which is seen as invoking a particular point of view 
in an attempt by the speaker to elicit empathy from the listener. 
One area of syntactic divergence has been explored here. Syrian 
grammaticalizes a resumptive topic function that does not seem to be 
syntactically marked in other dialects. The object-resumptive topic 
marker Ila-I marks highly individuated direct and oblique objects and 
recalls them into active discourse registry. The marking of individuation 
in this case parallels other cases in which Syrian speakers accord syntactic 
attention to (partly) individuated nouns, such as the indefinite-specific 
article ( 1 .4), indefinite-specific relative clauses with lillil (3. 1 )  and 
unstressed demonstrati ves (4.2). 
As I argued to be the case for other syntactic structures examined 
in this study, speaker control plays an important role in the realization 
of sentence structure. The speaker's perception of a state or event 
detennines its portrayal as topic-focused, event-focused, and the framing 
of entities as new topics, resumptive topics, contrastive topics, or new 
infonnation. 

CONCLUSIONS 
This overview of the syntax of four Arabic dialects has raised as 
many questions as it has answered. The most basic question I sought 
to answer, to what extent do the dialects share a common syntax, may 
now be more narrowly specified and focused, as the similarities and 
differences uncovered here point in several promising directions. A 
number of tentative conclusions and suggestions for further research 
may be proposed. 
Individuation and Syntactic Marking 
It has been emphasized throughout this study that the syntax of 
spoken language reflects not only formal, structural rules, but also 
speaker-controlled continua. Adapting the work of Khan (1984, 1988) 
and others, I have proposed a continuum of individuation that helps 
explain many kinds of syntactic variation in spoken Arabic. Individuation 
continua undoubtedly affect the syntax of many, if not all, languages. 
But even if the effect of individuation on syntax is indeed a language 
universal principle, its language-specific applications still remain to be 
compared and contrasted. Arabic dialects differ in the number of 
morphosyntactic markings they employ to mark individuation on nouns, 
and certain dialects tend to mark individuation on nouns more than 
others. I will review the findings of the present study on the syntactic 
features affected by the continuum of individuation, first with a broad 
overview of shared features, and then with dialect-specific observations 
and hypotheses. 
In Chapter 1, the continuum of individuation was shown to explain 
variation in the use of definite and indefinite articles. Chapter 2 argued 
that individuation can help explain patterns of agreement marking and 
the choice of genitive exponents over a genitive construct phrase. 
Speakers choose between collective and individuated plural agreement 
to reflect their perception of the noun's identity. They also choose 
between the construct state and the genitive exponent on the basis of 
several kinds of motivating factors, ranging from formal structural ones 
363 

364 
Conclusions 
to pragmatic factors. These pragmatic considerations seem to be shared 
by most of the dialects. In Chapter 3, it was argued that the occurrence 
of the definite relative pronoun on clauses modifying indefinite head 
nouns is also motivated by the partial individuation of that noun, and 
Chapter 4 showed that the patterned use of demonstrative articles and 
pronouns reflects in part the degree of individuation of the noun they 
modify. In Chapter 8, it was suggested that the mood marking on 
imperfective verbs may be affected by the degree of individuation of 
the nouns they modify, such that individuated nouns tend to occur with 
indicative marking, while non-specific nouns may attract unmarked 
(subjunctive) imperfectives. 
The features of spoken Arabic most affected by this continuum 
may be plotted along the original model as follows: 
Figure 4: Individuation and the Syntax of Spoken Arabic 
Unindividuated 
+ construct genitive 
- article 
+ collective agreement 
+ neutralized agreement 
- indicative mood 
- resumptive pronoun (reI)

± genitive exponent 
± new-topic article 
± quantifier 
Individuated 
+ definite article 
+ plural agreement 
+ relative pronoun 
+ genitive exponent 
+ mdicative mood 
Nouns that are more individuated tend to be marked with the definite 
article, a definite relative pronoun if modified by a relative clause, and 
modified with a genitive exponent (within the bounds of other constraints, 
such as inalienable possession, 2.4). Moroccan speakers tend to use 
the definite article to mark even a partial degree of individuation in 
nouns, in contrast to the behavior of speakers from other areas (1.6). 
At the opposite end of the continuum, unindividuated nouns tend to be 
indefinite, and if modified by a genitive, it tends to be expressed as a 
construct phrase. Cross-dialect variation is evident in the choice of the 
genitive exponent to express partly or unindividuated nouns: while 
Moroccan and Kuwaiti speakers make this choice regularly, Egyptian 
and Syrian speakers tend to use the genitive exponent to modify specified 
or individuated nouns only (2.4). Partly individuated nouns take a

365 
wide range of markings, and it is in this middle range that speakers 
exercise the greatest control over syntactic structure. Syntactic markers 
that signal partial specification or individuation include the indefinite­
specific article Ǘil in Moroccan and Syrian (1.4), and the "new-topic" 
article IwaJ:rid/, in all four dialects (1.5). Evidence suggests that Egyptian, 
Syrian, and Kuwaiti speakers use the dual suffix I-enl as a kind of 
new-topic article as well, since it tends to occur only with nouns that 
have some degree of individuation (2.1). 
In modifying plural nouns, speakers from all regions choose 
between collective (feminine) and individuated (plural) agreement 
marking to highlight the degree of individuation of the noun (2.2). 
Unindividuated nouns tend to take neutralized agreement in Egyptian; 
that is, in noun-adjective phrases containing relational (/nisbal) and 
classificational adjectives, the adjective often shows masculine singular 
agreement regardless of the gender of the noun (2.3). Agreement 
neutralization occurs in limited environments in the Syrian and Kuwaiti 
regions; no evidence of agreement neutralization has been found in 
Moroccan data. 
The motivation behind unexpected patterns in the relativization 
of indefinite nouns also seems to lie with the individuation continuum. 
The definite relative pronoun lillil normally modifies definite nouns 
only; its occurrence in indefinite relative clauses poses a problem for 
the description of spoken Arabic syntax. This problem is solved by the 
individuation continuum: while indefinite, non-specific head nouns are 
modified by indefinite relative clauses with no relative pronoun, an 
indefinite but specific noun may be modified by a "definite" lillil clause. 
Speakers from all four dialect regions can use the definite relative 
pronoun lillil to partly define or specify indefinite nouns (3. 1). 
Several pieces of evidence indicate that temporal nouns such as 
day, hour, and time tend to have a naturally low individuation in all 
dialects. These temporal nouns regularly occur in two low-individuated 
constructions across dialects. First, they may be modified with a non­
gendered demonstrative pronoun, Idik/. Expressions such as Idik in­
naharl the other day are attested in all four areas, except for urban 
Egypt and Syria (4.3). Second, all dialects share a relative construction 
in which these temporal nouns are nominalized rather than relativized, 

366 
Conclusions 
as demonstrated either by the absence of resumptive reference within 
the lillil clause in Moroccan, Syrian, and Kuwaiti, or the use of 
nominalizer Ima! instead of the relative pronoun lillil (3.4). 
Nominal marking phenomena in the dialects thus indicate that 
speaker control plays an important role in the syntactic realization of 
noun modification. Within this framework, however, variation can be 
seen among the dialects. Greater syntactic attention is accorded to 
marking individuation in Syria and Morocco: while Moroccan and 
Syrian speakers have at their disposal an indefinite-specific article, rw, 
Egyptian and Kuwaiti speakers have no such article. Moroccan and 
Syrian speakers also make use of indefinite-specific relative pronouns, 
Imal in Moroccan and Iminl in Syrian. 
Of particular note is the absence in Egyptian speech of several 
kinds of individuating nominal marking. All dialects except Egyptian 
have non-gendered, unstressed demonstrative articles that play a role in 
the marking of discourse topics and other salient entities (4.2). Egyptian 
speakers lack both an anaphoric demonstrative article and an indefinite­
specific article. 
Moreover, Egyptians tend to favor agreement 
neutralization of adjectives (masculine singular adjective forms) when 
modifying unindividuated noun phrases. Perhaps additional synchronic 
and diachronic research will shed light on whether or not these patterns 
result from syntactic levelling involving several different types of 
nominal marking. 
The Verb System 
The analysis of aspect in the dialects has distinguished between 
formal .and lexical aspect. Lexical aspect a property not of verb itself 
but of verbal meaning, since many Arabic verbs have a range of meanings, 
e.g., Inaml to sleep or go to sleep or IraQI (M Im8al to set out to go or to 
go (from one point to another) (6. 1). It is helpful to distinguish between 
telic and ate1ic meanings, especially in predicting the meaning of the 
active participle: telic verbal meanings result in a perfect reading for 
the participle, while atelic verbs of state and motion result in a stative, 
progressive reading. I have argued here that the three verb stems, 
perfective, imperfective, and participle, correspond to the three major 
types of formal aspect in language: perfective, imperfective, and perfect 

Conclusions 
367 
(6.2). Evidence from all four dialect areas attests to the primacy of 
aspect to the verb system of spoken Arabic, especially in the choice of 
verb forms in narrative contexts (6.5). Moreover, the narrative use of 
certain translocative verbs, called here narrative contour verbs, show 
surprising parallels across the four dialect regions (6.5). 
The most basic meaning of the participle in spoken Arabic is a 
resultant state, which corresponds to cross-linguistic deftnitions of perfect 
aspect. The progressive state meaning often given by participles of 
motion can be shown to derive from the resultant one (6.4). The 
participle carries no tense or time reference; rather, its time reference is 
established through context, adverbs, and temporal verbs (7.3). 
The dialects also share strategies of time reference and narrative 
temporal framing. Time reference in the dialects may be established in 
a number of ways. The most basic reference point is the moment of 
speech, but that point may be fairly easily shifted both grammatically, 
through the use of adverbs and temporal subordination, and contextually, 
through tense neutralization (7.1). In all dialects, a group of verbs 
called here temporal verbs, whose core member is the verb IUnl to be, 
takes as its primary function establishing time reference, especially of 
non-punctual events and states (7.3). 
The choice of verb form in conditional clauses ranges from 
perfective to imperfective or zero-verb (representing the present tense 
of to be) in copulative sentences. The use of imperfective and zero-verb 
in conditional clauses is not primarily related to time reference, but to 
aspect and mood. Aspectually, perfective verbs tend to occur in non­
stative conditionals, in which the event is one-time or action viewed as 
a (to-be-) completed whole. Imperfective and zero-verb, on the other 
hand, occur in stative conditionals. Modally, the use of perfective verb 
forms in conditional sentences indicates a relatively high degree of 
hypotheticality of the condition itself. However, some cross-dialect 
variation can be discerned in the use of non-perfective verb forms. 
While Moroccan speakers appear to maintain the use of perfective 
verbs in most, if not all conditional clauses, Egyptian speakers use 
zero-verb and certain stative imperfectives in stative conditionals, and 
Syrian and Kuwaiti speakers make regular use of imperfective verbs 
and null copula or zero-verb in stative and low-hypothetical conditionals 

368 
Conclusions 
or conditional sentences in which the expectation of fulfillment is 
relatively high (8.7). While unmarked use of the perfective indicates a 
realized, factual mood, in conditional contexts, the perfective fulfills 
the opposite function, indicating counterfactual, irrealis mood. It is the 
markedness of the usage that makes this role reversal work: the marked 
usage is the exact opposite of the unmarked. 
The same kind of reversal of markedness holds true for negation 
patterns as well. All dialects have three basic strategies of negation: 
verbal (9.3), predicate (9.4), and a marked "categorical negation," which 
indicates the categorical or absolute negation of an entity or set (9.5). 
The two basic unmarked negation strategies, verbal and predicate, also 
function as the marked form of negation for the other category. Thus, 
negation of verbs with the predicate negative Moroccan Ima8i/, Egyptian 
Imi8/, or Syrian and Kuwaiti Imu/, constitutes marked negation, the 
negation of a predicated proposition or presupposition. Likewise, the 
negation of a predicate with verbal negation, Moroccan and Egyptian 
Ima - 8I and Syrian and Kuwaiti Ima/, constitutes marked negation, 
lending verbal force to a participle or a nominal phrase functioning as a 
pseudo-verb. Both unmarked and marked negation patterns show strong 
parallels across the dialects. 
Sentence Typology 
A number of dialect studies assume that the unmarked word 
order in spoken Arabic is SVO. I have argued here that these dialects, 
like formal registers of Arabic, make use of both SVO and VSO sentence 
typologies in a principled manner, and that word order in Arabic is 
properly treated as being of two different typological types, topic­
ptominent (SVO) and SUbject-prominent (V SO). These typologies, 
recognized by the Arab grammarians, do not merely represent a 
convenient way to notate surface structures, but rather reflect two 
different information packaging options: one based on topic-prominent 
information found in contexts demanding the management of multiple 
discourse topics, and another in which the narration of ordered events 
is the primary organizing principle ( 10.2). Other variations in word 
order common in spoken Arabic, such as OVS, fronting, and predicate­
subject inversion, have been shown to follow similar patterns across 

Conclusions 
369 
dialects, and constitute information packaging devices that signal 
functions of new information, contrastive subject, object, and topic, 
and resumptive topic (10.3, 10.4). 
Cases of Individual Dialect Variation 
Only in a few cases does the syntax of one dialect follow a 
unique pattern not found in the others. 
In the area of sentence typology, Syrian grammaticalizes a 
resumptive topic function that does not seem to be marked in other 
dialects. 
The objectlresumptive topic marker Ila-I marks highly 
individuated direct and oblique objects (10.4). 
The marking of 
individuation in this case parallels other cases in which Syrian speakers 
accord syntactic attention to individuated nouns, the indefinite-specific 
article and the anaphoric demonstrative article. 
In addition to the regular lillil clause, Moroccan dialects show 
relativization strategies not found elsewhere. A relative pronoun lfa§1 
may be used to relativize non-human nouns of low individuation (3.6). 
At the same time, Moroccan speakers generally do not use resumptive 
pronouns to mark the syntactic position of the relativized noun with 
lilIi! (except in negative sentences). Taken together, these two strategies 
suggest that Moroccan may be shifting from a relativizing strategy that 
relies heavily on case-marking to one in which case marking plays a 
less significant role. 
The one area in which a large number of 
divergent developments emerge is verbal morphosyntax. Moroccan 
and Egyptian dialects exhibit parallel imperfective categories and 
functions, even though their lexical markers diverge. However, the 
mood systems of Syrian and Kuwaiti dialects depart substantially both 
from each other and from the western dialects. Syrian in particular 
makes use of a greater number of mood markers than any of the other 
three dialects, while Kuwaiti has fewer modal categories. The Syrian 
verbal prefix /h-I fulfills two functions, one a future intentive modal 
marker and the other a stative indicative one. The former is shared 
with Kuwaiti future intentive /h-I, while the latter parallels indicative 
Egyptian /hi-I, suggesting the possibility of cross-dialect contact and 
borrowing (8.4). 

370 
Conclusions 
lsog/osses 
Very few syntactic isoglosses emerge from this comparative study. 
In contrast, several features occur in geographically broken patterns, 
such as the indefinite-specific article I8i/, found in Morocco and Syria, 
but not in Egypt or Kuwait,' and the anaphoric demonstrative article 
/hal (M /had/) in Morocco, Syria, and Kuwait, but not Egypt (4.2). 
The single syntactic isogloss separating eastern and western dialect 
regions that emerges from this study is the use of the negative enclitic 
I-8/. The western dialects, Moroccan and Egyptian, negate with I-8/, 
whereas the eastern dialects, Syrian and Kuwaiti, do not. 
The rather transparent origin of the negative enclitic I-8I is assumed 
to be the word l8ay)/, thing (pronounced in most varieties of spoken 
Arabic as I8el or Јi/): in parts of Morocco and Egypt, and in certain 
contexts, the negative clitic I-8I retains the pronunciation I-8il and 
sometimes I8ayl (Harrell 1962: 152). The origin of this negation pattern 
can be reconstructed along the following lines: 
ा ..JिI L.. 
rna atrif 8ay) 
not know-I (a) thing 
I do not know at all 
Originally, then, Ima - 8I must have been an emphatic form, motivated 
by the pragmatic function "categorical negation" that I have argued is 
part of the negative repertoire of Arabic speakers. The hypothetical 
example above must then have shifted semantically from I don't know 
at all to I don't know, and the previous unmarked form, without I-8/, 
became marked as categorical. The shift of a given form from emphatic 
'Since it is not found in Egypt, the indefinite-specific article ISi/ in Morocco 
and Syria must either have developed independently, or be of common origin, 
that is, be traceable to dialects of Old (pre-Classical) Arabic. Other patterns 
of nominal marking common to all four areas, such as the "new topic" article 
/waJ:tid/ one, demonstrative articles. the non-gendered use of demonstrative 
pronouns in modifying nouns of luw individuation. also suggest a common 
origin for the dialects. These and many other features explored in this study 
support the notion that the modern dialects have descended from older dialects, 
and not from what we know as Classical Arabic. The range and detail of 
parallel syntactic structures and strategies described here have obvious negative 
implications for the likelihood of pidginization as proposed by Versteegh 
(1984). 

Conclusions 
371 
or marked to non-emphatic or unmarked is a well-attested process of 
historical change. 
The distribution of /-)/ suggests that it spread by means of dialect 
contact and borrowing throughout the region that it now occupies. The 
fact that negative /-)/ is not found in the urban dialects of greater Syria 
indicates that the spread of /-)/ occurred before the prolonged and 
intense political ties between Syria and Egypt beginning in the Ayyfibid 
period. The fact that Shi(ite and Druze dialects of the Levant also use 
/-)/ suggests that this particle was already in use at the time of their" 
migration from Fatimid Egypt. It thus seems probable that the use of 
/-)/ as a negative particle spread throughout the Fatimid Caliphate during 
the tenth century, and continued to spread thereafter throughout North 
Africa and followed emigrants from there to the rural and mountain 
regions of greater Syria. 
The history of /-)/ before the tenth century is probably untraceable; 
however, it may be concluded with some degree of certainty that this 
feature had already undergone some development before it began to 
spread. 
If verbal negation with /-)/ originated as an emphatic or 
categorical negation strategy, coexisting with non-emphatic negation 
without /-)/, then at some point, this pragmatic distribution must have 
reversed itself, and /-)/ gradually lost its emphatic status. Because /-)/ 
fulfills the same functions in both Morocco and Egypt, it is unlikely 
that this reversal took place independently across such a large geographic 
area. It seems more likely that /-)/ had already lost its emphatic status 
at the time when it spread throughout Fatimid North Africa. 
It is also worth noting that Moroccan retains greater usage of the 
(now marked) form of negation without /-)/, and that Cairene Arabic 
restricts the contexts in which the marked form of negation occurs. 
Suggestions for Further Study 
All of the features examined here merit further attention, both to 
expand the framework to encompass data from other dialects and to 
test the analyses proposed. In addition, several features may be singled 
out as deserving of more intensive study than has been possible here. 
In the area of definite and indefinite marking, more synchronic 
research is needed in the dialect areas that retain the nunation or /tanwin/

Conclusions 
suffix I-inl to substantiate the hypothesis that this suffix fulfills a 
pragmatic function of marking indefinite-specific nouns. 
This study has suggested that further sociolinguistic attention to 
agreement patterns may uncover a role for agreement in signaling social 
status. Speakers' use of collective and individuated plurals for humans 
may, at times, reflect their perception of the social prominence of 
various social groups, and by extension, their own relative status. 
The development of mood markers for the indicative mood is 
widespread among the dialects, but is not necessarily an inevitable path 
of development. Kuwaiti may be developing in a different direction, 
increasingly marking non-indicative moods with the frozen particle 
leanl (8.5). Cross-dialect research into dialects that mark subjunctive 
or non-indicative moods is needed to establish both synchronic systems 
and diachronic patterns of development of modal marking in spoken 
Arabic. 
The two typological features of word order and negation appear 
to be parallel in structure. The principled use of verbal and predicate 
negation strategies may mirror the patterning of VSO and SVO word 
order and topic-prominent and subject-prominent typologies. Within 
this general framework, Cairene Arabic appears to be in the process of 
losing its verbal negation strategy. Compared to rural Egyptian and 
Moroccan patterns, in which verbal negation with Ima - 8I retains a role 
in negating non-topical structures, the Cairene use of Ima - 8I is restricted, 
and is losing ground to predicate negation with ImW. Both the processes 
of change and possible implications for underlying VSO sentence 
typology in Cairene should be explored further. 
Љinally, during my research, I made note of several 
morphosyntactic structures that seem to exhibit distribution patterns 
following an approximate (but not always absolute) east-west division. 
Further research into the distribution of these features may be worth 
pursuing.

when suffixed (5.4). This feature may be related to the pronunciation 
of the /tanwin/ suffix I-in! on participles, found today in some areas of 
the Arabian Peninsula (Ingham 1994). The distribution of this feature 
may thus contribute to the diachronic study of the /tanwin/ suffix. 
The use of /ya-/ to mark the direct object in double-object pronoun 
constructions is found in the two eastern dialects but not the two western 
ones. Thus Syrian and Kuwaiti speakers use /ya-/ to mark the direct 
object of ditransitive arguments:

elative patterns with faf<al/, and alternatively, regular adjectives paired 
with the "comparative" prepositions /min! than and lan/. The former 
is prevalent in Egyptian, Syrian, and Kuwaiti dialects:3

He should have returned her as she was,[it would've been] nobler 
pronunciation of feminine It I on the participle in Libyan follows eastern, not 
western, patterns (see examples in Mitchell 1952) . 
3Cowell's extensive list of I'af'al/ words suggests that this morphological 
pattern may be more productive in the eastern dialects than the western ones 
(1964:31 1-12).

Moroccan speech, on the other hand, exhibits "limited use of the 
comparative form as a superlative" (Harrell 1962:205); I have found no 
examples of this type of construction in my Moroccan data. Moroccan 
speakers do make use of the alternative comparative construction, in 
which any adjective may be made comparative by means of prepositions 
/min/ or fala/ than :

Finally, the frequency of two particular morphological patterns 
appears to vary from region to region. First, the morphological diminutive 
(the /fu'ayyil/ pattern and variants) is highly productive in Moroccan 
(the immediately preceding Moroccan example contains one, /_l:Iayyl:la/ 
a Ϗit healthy; see also Harrell 1962: 8 1 ), less common but present in 
Kuwait, limited to certain fixed expressions in Egypt, and quite restricted 
in the Syrian area. Second, the Levantine dialects show a more productive 
use of the stative participle form /fa'lan/ with a perfect meaning, such 
as Lebanese /inte Qa'ran/ you have lost weight.4 The /fa'lan/ pattern is 
limited to certain stative lexical items in Egypt and Morocco. 
These features represent only a few of the many morphosyntactic 
features deserving of comparative study.

Postscript 
This project originally began, in part, in response to the claim 
that Arabic dialects are mutually unintelligible, and that the only language 
Arabs have in common is the formal register. Over the course of many 
years studying Arabic here and abroad, I have often heard such statements 
as, "I don't understand Moroccans/Kuwaitis/Egyptians when they 
speak;" "Moroccans speak French, not Arabic;" and "Why don't Syrians 
speak ",'arabi/" Arabic like us?" While during this century speecl). 
communities in many parts of the world have found themselves in a 
position to take advantage of increased contact with other dialect 
communities via mass communication and travel, all-but-closed borders 
(and sometimes attitudes) in the Arab world have prevented an similar 
increase in interdialectal contact. Now, after echoes of the voices of 
Arab nationalists SaW al-Husari, Gamal Abd ai-Nasser, Michel 'Aflaq, 
and others have almost died, modem technology has begun to find 
away around-or above-these barriers. In the last eight years, between 
the time that a primitive version of this study was presented as a 
doctoral dissertation and the time that I finished reworking it for 
publication, the rapid spread of satellite television and the appearance 
of multinational broadcasting networks such as the ART Movie and 
Entertainment Network, MBC in London, and AI-Jazira in Qatar have 
begun to make their impact on the Arabic speech community by offering 
programming in a number of varieties and registers of Arabic. My 
Egyptian colleague Abbas el-Tonsi can now watch Moroccan movies 
at home in Cairo, and reports that, as a result, he has come to understand 
a great deal of the Moroccan dialect. Such developments, if they 
continue, will undoubtedly affect spoken Arabic over the long term, as 
larger "virtual" speech communities take their place beside local ones. 
A greater degree of consensus on what constitutes "Arabic"-now the 
subject of heated debates and disagreements-rnay emerge as a result. 
This trend will not decrease the need for studies of spoken Arabic; if 
anything, it should increase interest in, and lessen ' apprehension 
surrounding, such projects.

(2) He went and complained. They told him, my friend, what will you 
do? one thing: whoever you find telling a joke, take a book and write 
it down, and you write it down. (3) That's exactly what he did, whoever 
he found saying "What did Jummani do?," [he told him} tell me, and 
he would write it down. (4) Until he gathered them all, and he tears up 
the book. (5) He told them, now lookfor something to say! 
IAI-Jummani is a Moroccan Jul:ta-like character, the subject of many popular 
jokes.

'The recording begins here, in the middle of a narrative about how the 
speaker's mother-in-law made her early married life difficult. This portion 
recounts an incident in which the speaker ruined the sweet couscous she was 
making for guests and tried to cover up the waste for fear of being chastised. 

Moroccan Texts

(1) . . .  when I had some guests to whom I wanted to serve that platter of 
sweet couscous to eat. (2) Well, I got scared again of my mother-in-law 
that she would pick a fight with me or say something to me. (3) I 
emptied that other -- that pail all of it in that -- mush -- what had 
become like mush, (4) I emptied it in the pail and then sent and bought 
more semolina and then made another sweet coucous and served the 
sweet couscous, this other one, and said nothing. (5) My mother, who 
had come over, she and my aunt, was on her way out, and I was afraid 
that my mother-in-law wouldfind that thing [and} pick a fight wiJh m-e' 
or something, I was very afraid of her. (6) I told my mother, here's a 
scandal, for God's sake, this pail, take it from me, see where you can 
put it or throw it out or where .. (7) Here my mother-in-law has 
suspected (something), she said, Now, this one, see what she gave to 
her mother or what she stole or what she did or ... (8) Those people of 
old were a great dificulty. We had a rough time of it. (9) She began 
to criticize me, she says, well, so that's it, people eat, they eat and 
drink and when they are on their way out, stuff is given them and they 
take it too. (10) Madam, curse the devil, look, there is nothing at all 
[going on}. (1 1) Well, she kept on picking fights and kept on -- and we 
would get through the days.

(1) 1 tell you a story about a man whose wife bears only girls, she has 
no son. (2) He up and said to her, 1 need a son. (3) He up and 
married another woman, he married one other woman; two wives he 
took. (4) That one had seven children, the other one he married then 
so she could have {a son}. (5) That one who had seven was pregnant, 
was going to give birth, she too. (6) When her month arrived, they 
deserted her, (7) {the other wife} said, get up, man, the woman is going 
to have another girl again, now let's leave her here and let her take 
care of herself. (8) Get up and let's leave this place and go to another 
place and leave her here in the house by herself. (9) Her daughters up 
and said to her, Mother, the girl [the second wife} ignores us, she 
doesn't pay attention to us at all. (10) {The father} said, Give me, my 
daughter, I am going to walk and take a basket of ashes, (11) one 
{daughter} will carry a basket of chaff on their backs when they set 
out, and their mother {can} follow them by the signs on the road. 
(12) {They told the mother} We are going to leave and go to the place 
that you don't know; you will follow only these ashes and chaff until 
that place where we will alight, and you follow us. (13) The girls left 
with their father, they set off, leaving at night. (14) In the morning, she 
got up, poor thing, didn't find a thing in the house except the walls, 
{she was} all alone. (15) Her labor pains took hold, {but} she kept 
going, kept going, kept going, until she got close to them, Joliowing 
only that road -- that marking on the road. (16) She arrived {to a 
place near them}, as if she arrived at that cemetery over there, the 
labor pains set in there. 
(1 7) There she lay down and gave birth. 
(18) The houris (beautiful spirits) and the angels came to her and 
helped her give birth. (19) They told her, Call out 'my good deed(s), 
my reward( s),' if you have given anything, any alms in this life it will 
come back to you now. 
(20) She didn't find anything, poor dear,

neither to eat nor to wrap the child in, and the child was born to her. 
(21) Well, she was overjoyed when the son was born to her, and she 
came on the road near to where her husband went. (22) She was close 
to reaching him, and gave birth on the road, as if she had come to 
that cemetery there by your house, and gave birth. (23) They say 
that people went and told him, So-and-so, a woman of such-and-such 
description gave birth in that cemetery. (24) His slave went shopping, 
and passed by her. 
She had given birth, and she had borne a son. 
(25) He said, How? [The slave] said, She had a son. (26) He said, If 
she had a son I'll take her back. (27) They say that he went and took, 
dear lady, fine clothing, the caftan, with the dress and the shoes, a 
whole ensemble, and was so happy, and took the flutists and the drums 
and went to where she,was. (28) But he sent the slave first, he told 
him, go, if she bore [a] son leave her and come to me. (29) [If] she 
had a daughter, slay her and slay the girl and come. (30) That slave 
went to her, and told her, my master asks what you bore? She told 
him, I bore a girl. (31) He said, tell me what you bore, look, if you had 
[a] girl, I will slay you and slay her. (32) Until she saw him heading 
toward her with the knife, [then] she said calm down, I bore [a] son, 
[a] young man is what I had. (33) He went, dear lady, and got on [his 
riding beast] and went to [his master], he told him, she bore [a] son. 
(34) He brought her the ensemble, he brought her the flutists, he brought 
the drummers. (35) They brought and washed her and dressed her and 
dressed and carried the boy and took her to the house [because] the 
[other] wife said to him, Her I do not want to see. (36) Her daughters 
were very happy, they [were] serving [the guests], they slaughtered, 
[the father] invites people, and the flutes and the drums, it was as if 
you'd say he had just taken her as a bride, [so] happy with that son.

(1) The beach, really, what am I going to tell you, the beach is good 
and bad. (2) Good, because -- [it's] good, [but] it changed, on account 
that people are no longer the type that [have] respect, they no longer 
the type of -- the type of --
a type of harmony, (3) people don't 
understand each other, they don't understand at all, and they -- (4) The 
other [person] eats over here, the other one eats watermelon, the 
other one throws trash here, the other one is lying down by himself, 
(5) He has to take over [the space], he has to sit in that place by 
himself, he has to swim by himself, he has to do this and that, not 
- ­
(6) That is, because he has to -- he wishes the beach were all his, you 
understand? He has to have the beach to himself, all of it. (7) Then 
again even that liveliness of the person who comes there to the seashore 
is no longer as it was. (8) Now you see a lot of people native of the 
town no longer go to the seashore at aLL, the natives of the town. 
(9) Only the outsider is the one who goes; the native of the town no 
longer goes to the seashore. (10) Now the outsider has -- the native of 
the town all go to another spot -- like for instance some place far from 
the shore of Larache . . .  (11) Miami? No, the thing is, that [spot], 
Miami, is a nearby situation, no, like now for instance in front of the 
prison, where Msitro is, where l-Ma Jdid is, where you find [a] spot by 
yourself there, there aren't a lot of people. (12) And then again there 
at the beach there happen a lot of things that infringe, that touch the 
personal space of the person. (13) Like for instance [a] person drinks 
wine, he keeps on -- he keeps on saying a nasty word, he says some bad 
things that --
(14) [A] person is sitting with -- he and his wife, he 
hears tliat stuff, he gets upset. (15) He gets upset and he explodes and 
he is fo!ced to -- and he gets up in a hurry to leave, to no longer come 
to this place. (16) Then again when it occurs to them that they'd like to 
sit in a cafe and [so that he can] relax awhile and drink tea or coffee 
or water or a soft drink, another one comes along then drunk, and 
comes and throws up on the place where he is sitting he and his wife 
and kids. (17) What does he do, he gets up to fight with him, the police 
come and [people] come and -- rap! rap! here the [fight] is no longer, 
then they smooth things over. (18) Or for instance, [a] man lies on 
[the beach], he and his wife are sitting on the shore like so, another 
guy, a jerk comes along and "leans on" them [bothers them], teases 

Moroccan Texts

them, throws sand on them and so on - - (19) [There are] many things 
which make [a] person constantly no longer want to go to the shore ... 
(20) We, for instance, a young single guy is not like a married man. 
(21) The family ... families no longer go down [to the beach], the 
young single guy, even the young single men native to the town no 
longer go down, rarely. (22) And you notice this problem, you see 
these people a lot.

(1) Well, I'll tell you about something! (2) One day Susu, last year 
before she left maybe less than a month, it was fifteen or ten days, she 
woke up in the morning feeling very poorly, (3) saying, I got at three 
o'clock a horrible pain in my ear , (4) and she sat up for a long time, 
around two hours, and then about five o'clock as i/you'd say [the pain] 
settled down a bit, or she got tired and her eyes closed. (5) [She got 
up] at six o'clock and went to work. (6) I found her coming backfrom 
work early, and she said, I'm feeling very poorly, we're going to the 
doctor. (7) Indeed, we went to the doctor. (8) So we went, and she 
tells him, my ear, such and such happened. (9) So he examines her ear 
a bit, [suddenly] we found him bringing a tweezer, and he went and 
pulled out and put in a piece of cotton, I found an insect! (10) I mean, 
it [was] somewhat like afly, between afly and a worm. (11) And it has 
something like a tail, it was still alive, imagine, this is what went in her 
ear while she was sleeping. (12) A skinny little tail. (13) So he says to 
her, What's this? Were you sitting under a tree or something?!

(1) He didn't understand because he hadn't heard it before, but I'll tell 
you something. (2) There is a situation --
I understand what you 
mean. (3) For instance there is this serial that they used to show on 
]V that says "ls it really necessary, Mayor? Tonight?!" (4) Do you 
know "ls it really necessary, Mayor, tonight?!" why? (5) I'm telling 
you, there is an expression, there is a sentence that says "ls it really 
necessary, Mayor, tonight?" (6) He was -- he [was} married to two 
[women}. (7) Because I mean I understand the meaning you are saying. 
(8) {He was} married to two {women}. And each one, when he would 
go sleep with the other one, the other wife, her co-wife, that is, would 
get angry. (9) So each one of them, when he would go and sleep with 
his other wife, would go and knock on his {door} and {say} "Come 
here," I don't know what, [something} happened -- I didn't see it, but I 
heard [about it}. (10) She says to him -- he says to her, "ls it really 
necessary? Tonight?" She says to him, "Yes, come." (II) It is her 
night, the night of the other [wife], do you understand? (12) He sleeps 
with the other one, and she wants him {that} night. (13) He tells her, 
"Is it really necessary tonight?" Tonight, Mayor.

(1) Adel lmam was riding in an airplane, he and Yousra, they were 
deplaning, and he said, welcome home (thank Godfor your safe arrival). 
(2) She said, Do you know me, sir? (3) He said, yes, didn't you use to 
work in the Research Institute Such-and-Such? So -- she said to him, 
but how do you know? (4) He told her, I am a relative of Mister I 
don't know who, Jack or Jim. (5) So she told him, Yeah, that's who did 
a book with me, he did a book with me and stuff. 
(6) So, oh yeah, 
when they were leaving, he forgot his briefcase, [leaving it] with her. 
(7) So, she didn't know his address, so she one day -- she took the 
briefcase with her when they went home. (8) One day she found a cat 
inside the closet after the 
--
(9) She up and comes and puts the 
briefcase, his mother's briefcase, in its place and she shuts the cat in

Egyptian Texts 
the closet. (10) Then the cat up and disappeared, it and the briefcase. 
(11) After that she comes looking for the briefcase [but] didn't find it, 
and she doesn't know [where it is], and she's upset and so on. (12) So 
one day Adel lmam was annoying her, so then he came to her place of 
work and so on. She told him, there is a situation that happened that I 
can't tell you about. (13) He said, what is it? She told him, the 
briefcase that you leftfor me got lost. (14) He told her -- it was -- she, 
he tells (told) her that there are important papers and stuff but there 
really weren't. (15) So she told him, she told him that the briefcase 
that you told me had important papers in it got lost. (16) He told her, 
in all honesty, I was lying to you because it didn't have any papers that 
were important to me, and so forth. (17) She said to him, But then 
what was in it? (18) He told her, It had some papers about my 
mother's inheritance and ordinary stuff (19) So she told him, I'm very 
sorry, and so forth. (20) He came the next day, came in the morning, 
she wasn't in the office. (21) He up and put a briefcase for her [to 
find], just like the briefcase that had been in the closet. (22) She came 
and asked the secretary, Who brought that briefcase here? (23) [The 
secretary] told her, Mr. Fahmi. Then he came after a while and she 
asked him, how were you able to bring this briefcase? (24) He said, 
this isn't the other briefcase, this is a briefcase just like it. (25) But I 
bought itfrom the same guy I bought [the other one] from. (26) Then 
the secretary came and asked him, what would you like to drink? He 
said, coffee with medium sugar. (27) So she made him the coffee, he 
comes to drink it, he keeps drinking it, normal, and so on. (28) Finally, 
after they finished talking about the problem of the briefcase and stuff, 
she co"}es and tells him, 1 hope you liked the coffee. He said, it [was] 
go'Od .
. (29) After he left, she comes looking at the cup, and found the 
coffee just as it was [originally]. (30) But he was really drinking, but 
the coffee, that is, she didn't know what returned it [to its original 
state).

( 1) What's more, 1 mixed [socialized] a lot with the wife of the president 
of the university there. (2) The [wife of the] president of the university 
arranged for us a luncheon when 1 first arrived too, (3) and she 
invited me to it and sent me a private secretary to speak with me in 
Arabic to translate for me in Arabic because when 1 went 1 didn't know 
English at all -- my original [foreign] language is French -- (4) and 
they sent -- they called me on the phone and said we -- first they had 
sent the-card, two or three days later they called. (5) The secretary of 
the university president's wife telephoned saying we -- she talked with 
Muhan;mad because 1 didn't know English - - (6) A woman talked with 
him who said, we have invited [your] wife. (7) He said, we received 
the card. (8) She said, but we know she doesn't know English. (9) For 
that reason we have assigned for her a private secretary who will call 
within a couple of days because she can speak Arabic in order to take 
her to the visit, that is, to the luncheon that the wife of the president of 
the university has arranged for us. (10) We went, and there all of 
them were wives of doctors andfrom all the countries of the world, you 
know, French ... 1 swear to God, 1 had a very very good time when 1 

Syrian Texts 
399 
went there. (11) Yeah, because the life I lived, I mean, my neighbors 
used to tell me, you are living -- Reagan isn't living like you are, I 
swear to God, I'm telling you. (12) We had a very nice time, we got a 
very nice house. (13) The area where we took the house was very nice 
and very rich, and the house that we got was very nice: first of all, it 
wasn't a rental house. (14) [lnJ the whole region over there they don't 
rent to anyone at all, at all, ever, ever. (15) And if someone wants [to 
rent, it must beJ someone from among them, that is, [it'sJ practically 
closed off, no one enters it except for the people who live in the area in 
particular, there is -- in that entrance there is a security guard. (16) I 
mean, not just anyone can enter that area; there are no foreigners at 
all at all. (17) I mean, we, when she rented us the house, she rented us 
the house because -- by way of the dean of the School of Architecture 
she rented it to us. (18) After she sent a letter to all the neighbors 
explaining to them who we were and what we were, one by one, I'm 
telling you, the wife is such-and-such, Rana the oldest is studying 
architecture, the youngest, Dina, is in the tenth [gradeJ, (19) that is, 
she had written all sorts of details about us, [we knowJ because she left 
a [copy of] the letter in the house so that we could read what she had 
sent to the neighbors. (20) So, from the time we arrived, -- hadn't she 
sent the neighbors that letter? and they agreed that she could rent us 
the house, she then rented us the house -- all of them started calling 
on the telephone to say hello to us, and then they came and had coffee 
at our house. (21) One of them had a party, in the evening, after 
supper, at eight o'clock, she had a party for all the neighbors and 
introduced them to us. (22) They started, you know, every one [startedJ 
inviting us while we were -- after that we invited them and they came to 
our house and there started to be a lot of, you know -- (23) Imagine, I 
would be sitting in the morning, there would be a knock [atJ the door, 
now, how did you get here? (24) They would knock at the door and 
say to me, What are you doing? If you don't have anything [aren't 
busyJ, we'd like to come in and have a cup of coffee [withJ you. 
(25) I'm telling you -- Then they, I told them -- [OneJ said, What is 
your opinion about America? I told him, well, my opinion about America 
has changed a lot from the time that I was in Syria [toJ the time I came 

400 
Appendix 2 
to America. (26) He said, How has it changed? / told him, We know 
that [a] neighbor doesn't know his neighbor, [but] / found here something 
else. (27) He said, no, don't suppose that this is America. We here are 
an area other than America. (28) He said, your idea is correct. Go 
outside of this area and you find the same thing, a neighbor doesn't 
know a thing about his neighbor at all at all. (29) I'm telling you, 
those [people] would be walking their dogs, they would be taking a 
stroll in the road, they would knock at the door and say, Do you have 
any objection if we [come in] to drink some coffee? I'd say to them, 
Why, no! (30) / learned the language, / learned the language from my 
neighbors, (from] the amount that / would talk with them and be forced 
to talk with them / learned the language from them. (31) But I took a 
language course at the university, I did [that] first, because / didn't 
know a single word, it wasn't reasonable to stay like idiots. (32) I 
mean, it's very difficult If one doesn't know a language. (33) I took a 
language course first, after that I found myselffrom the amount that I 
was going out and coming and going with them I got very good practice. 
(34) I mean, it was no longer important to me to take another course. 
(35) I had a very good time, a very good time. I told them, really, the 
life l ied in America is the life of "Dallas" and "Dynasty."

( 1) The customs of the old [generations J --our fathers and forefathers-­
they used not to see the bride until the night of the wedding. (2) Now, 
this present generation arrange their own marriages, they don't want 
anyone to arrange for them, that is. (3) And they see each other and 
get to know each other, neither the father need wear himself out nor 
the mother need wear herself out. (4) And they form their own friendships. 

Syrian Texts 
403 
Yeah. (5) It changed, that is, the old pattern changed. 
(6) And 
they say, you know, that the man wouldn't see the bride nor she see him 
but they [the marriages] would survive longer than nowadays. 
(7) There didn't used to be, didn't used to be thinking like there is 
today. 
(8) That is, now they get engaged and you get [them] 
engaged and [the bride-to-be] comes and goes and then he marries 
her, two weeks, three, a month, he tells you I love her, I don't love her. 
(9) But in the old days he wouldn't see the bride and right away you 
find there would come to be mutual understanding and they'd have 
children and all that and there wouldn't be--there wouldn't at all arise 
disagreements. (10) Now you see that they know each other, they 
interact with each other for a year or two years and then when they get 
married, [they] tell you, Disagreements with her have arisen, and I'm 
mad at him, and he's mad at me, we couldn't get along. ... 
- - ­
(11) Love with each other falls apart, they hate each other; that is, 
they would desire each other but as soon as they get married, they stay 
[together awhile, then] they turn around and hate each other, yeah, 
that's what happens. 
(12) ... This one, his friend [was] married, his 
mother is Egyptian, and she went and got him engaged to her brother's 
daughter. (13) She brought her from Egypt, from there to here, and 
she stayed with them fifteen days (two weeks) until the wedding took 
place. (14) After he married her, he said, I don't love her any more, he 
said, I don't want to go back in the house. (15) He came and talked to 
us here, and we thought to take him to a shaykh to write him something-­
that is, to make the marriage work, not something [bad]. (16) He 
didn't give her a chance, he divorced her and sent her back to her 
country. ---
(17) He sent her [back] to Egypt. ---
(18) Look here, 
now it hasn't even been a week, you haven't even been [married] ten 
days ... ---
(19) She stayed - she came with him from Egypt to here, 
she stayed fifteen days until the wedding took place. 
(20) His 
cousin, she is. 
- - -
(21) Fifteen days until, that is, so that they could 
buy her things and so forth, then they had the wedding. (22) He stayed 
with her three days, on the evening of the third day he told them I don't 
love her, I want to get rid of her. (23) Look here, son, we brought you 
your cousin, do you want to shame us before your uncle, and such, he 

404 
Appendix 2 
told them ... 
(24) [It's) an embarrassment, that is. 
(25) Within fifteen days she was in Egypt. (26) He bought her a ticket 
and sent [it) to her, he divorced he and sent her [back). 
- - ­
(27) [He is) poorly bred (doesn't know how to behave properly), he 
should have sent her back as she was [before marrying her, it would 
have been) more noble. (28) You aren't in love with her, you should 
have not loved her from the beginning, from the beginning, not [after) 
- and she stayed two weeks at his house without him marrying her ??? 
(29) And [her) lunch is his lunch (they have lunch together), [her) 
breakfast is his breakfast, [her) dinner is his dinner, and come one, 
come all [to the wedding). (30) And then when he married her three 
days and he told them, I didn't love her.

(1) [For] us, love in the village [is] very -- it was at first in the past a 
big deal and stuff (2) Now, girls have begun to pay no mind, they no 
longer care, that is. (3) In the past [people] would see a couple 
walking together: God! what a crime. (4) Now you find [with] this 
rising generation, that the smart girl [says] go for it -- they want to go 
out: my family is not a problem, let me love and have a good time and 
stuff, it's okay. (5) Now, in our village, if a couple are in love and 
everyone hears about them, God! it's a big deal. (6) Every time 
someone comes to askfor her hand they come [saying], this girl was in 
love with so and so, she used to go out with him, she used to walk 
around with him, she was despicable, she was such and such 
-­
(7) They don't let for example -- they try in all sorts of ways, the ones 
who have heard [something], so as to prevent the [prospective] groom 
-- don't marry her, she was involved with someone, she was -- (8) Now 
everyone has gotten somewhat used to seeing a couple walking together 
like that. (9) But as well, if a girl crosses the line and stuff, that is, if 
she is a bit loose in her relationships, they also shun her quite a bit. 
(10) Now often it is no longer the case that the guys no longer care for 
example that they marry a girl if she is very pretty and so forth, if she 
is not educated, no way will he think about [marrying] her, except 
someone who's quite inane, that is. (11) That is, she won't marry the 
man she really wants. (12) As for now when she is educated and so 
forth and has become productive and goes out and works, she has 
started finding other ways to meet [a] good, appropriate life-partner. 
(13) As for before, that's it -- if she's pretty - wow! educated, uneducated, 

408 
Appendix 2 
it's all the same. (14) Now, too, it's all the same, that is, a boy loves a 
girl, even if she has had a love affair and whatnot, also, it doesn't make 
any diference to him, and also if she had a relationship with someone 
else it's okay with him. (15) We remain in the village until today 
[suchJ that there is not this increase, that is, these explicit relationships 
and the like, (16) a girl still behaves with reserve, that is, [soJ they 
don't hear a lot [about what she doesJ -- that is, a substantial number 
of people, (1 7) because one still has her enemies and her friends, and 
so forth, because they ruin her future, for sure, [sayingJ she has had 
love relationships and she has messed things up and her record is 
blotted (torn) and so forth. (18) You know, stuff like that, they don't 
leave him alone, that is, they try by every means to get him away [from 
her]. (19) Of course, those who dislike her [do thatJ. Asfor those who 
like her, [they say, she'sJ good, sure, everyone falls in love, everyone 
gets infatuated, everyone 
... (20) That is to say, there's no longer a 
problem ... (21) 1 am the type that thinks about society because 1 am 
of the society, if I don't think abut society that means I'm not of the 
society. (22) I mean, one has to go slowly, not come all at once for 
example -- (23) This society is morally strict, veiled, [andJ so forth, it 
comes about all at once [thatJ you love and you go out and come in 
and sleep with the one you 10ve[?J (24) This thing society rejects, 
especially [sinceJ we have a country, that is our country is morally 
strict, they say about it Islamic and conservative. (25) That is, it 
doesn't permit this thing and especially until now there are places in 
Damascus for instance [they areJ so strict, it's impossible for a guy to 
talk to a girl. (26) In the house, for example, there are areas here in 
Damasŉus [where it'sJ impossible for you to enter the house for a 
quarter of an hour so that they can see [the women are hiddenJ "cover 
up, women and get out of the way!" and so forth, so that one is able for 
instance to enter the house. (27) And if -- it's impossible for them to 
show their hair for example to people: "What is this?!" (28) Does the 
father accept, or society, that a girl can come and go and have lots of 
relationships with guys and talk with guys and at the same time they 
know that she has a sexual relationship?! (29) Of course, this is a big 
problem, and it's impossible for anyone to think about [marryingJ her, 
that is.

matchmaker who makes matches, for years I used to come and go with 
her. She taught me how matchmaking is [done}. ---
(5) How is the 
way [to do it}? 
---
(6) The way to do it is that the boy's mother, the 
boy's sister calls you on the phone and says, Umm So-and-So, we want 
for our son a wife (girl). (7) You tell her, Okay, God willing. She asks 
me, she asks me, she says, We want for him such and such, (a girl who 
is) studying, we want for him someone who has finished her studies, we 
want for him a girl who works, or doesn't work, veiled or not veiled. 
(8) I tell her, Give me (information on) what his job is, I tell (ask) her 
(if) he works or doesn't work, she tells me he works. (9) I say, What 
degree does he hold? I ask her what his degree is, she says, well -
[there is one} who says he has finished secondary school, [one} who 
says he has finished university, [one} who says he has graduated from 
a school abroad, and [one} who says he has no degree. (10) Anyway, 
the important thing is, we tell her, Okay, God willing, whatever request 
you want. (11) We lookfor a girlfor him. We take hisfull name, the 
full name of the boy and his job, the information that we have, all of it, 
about him, we call the girl's family, [saying}, Get back in touch with 
me in three days and I'll give you an answer. (12) We look for a girl 
who is suitable for him. (13) We say to the girl's family, The boy is 
such and such,from - the son of so-and-so son of so-and-so, he works 
as such and such, she says, Okay, Umm Ahmed. We give her (the 
information) and tell her (all that). (14) She says, she comes back and 
tells us, the mother of the girl comes back and tells me, Umm Ahmed, 
do you know him? (15) I tell her, No, I don't know him. The mother 
has called me on the phone saying, I want you to find a bride for my 
son; the same way I don't know you, I don't know him, I don't know a 
thing about them. (16) When I bring him to [meet} you, you can 
inquire - [the girl's mother} inquires - you can inquire about him and 
he can inquire about you. (17) We have called the mother of the boy 
and told her we have found for you a girl, daughter of so-and-so, 
Daughter of whom? She asks me the same [things} that I had asked 
[the girl's family}. (18) She asks me, Daughter of so-and-so son of 
so-and-so, I tell her, and she takes [the girl's} full name to tell her son. 
(19) She says, Umm Ahmed, no, let me go and see her first. (20) I 
refuse, I tell her, No, first let the boy come and see the girl and take a

look at her without - You, that is, you [can come] with him and his 
sister, that's okay, but the boy must come with you. (21) I refuse to let 
her come alone. (22) Anyway, he comes - She tells me, Okay, make a 
date [for] which day we will come, and I'll go with you and we'll see 
the girl. (23) I call the girl's family and say, Look, today they're 
coming - we're coming, God willing, his mother and his sister and the 
boy with us. (24) The boy sits, the girl comes in, either bringing juice 
or bringing a cold drink, or anything, tea, the girl enters and he sees 
[her]. (25) He is sitting [there], I tell him, This is the girl, go ahead, 
take a look at her. He looks at her, okay. 
(26) If, that is, there is 
[positive reaction, I say], Ask her, if you want her or whatnot, ask her 
about the thing you want. He asks. (27) The girl, of course, is shy, it's 
not seemly, that is, [for] a girl after all to come running like that, she's 
shy. (28) He asks her, Where do you work, what have you studied. 
(29) Asfor me, I tell her, Then you ask. She asks. (30) There are girls, 
that is, who can ask, and there are girls who are too shy and don't ask. 
(31) She asks, we sit, he asks her and she asks him, good-bye, good-bye, 
we leave, that's that. (32) I, of course, I ask the boy in the car, I say, 
Hmm? Did you like the girl, son, or didn't you like her? (33) Sometimes 
they answer me in the same words, saying, Well, Umm Ahmed, I liked 
the girl, see what the girl's reply is, and sometimes by God he says, 
Hopefully it will work out for the best. (34) The one that tells you 
hopefully it will work out for the best, I know that he doesn't want the 
girl, and the one who tells you, Well, ask the girl, see what she said 
about me, what her opinion of me is, that one, I know that he likes the 
girl; as for the girl, she has an opinion [too}. (35) Anyway, the 
importq.nt thing is, they drop me off at my house, and I go back and 
cu"/l them, at the same time I call the girl, if he likes her, I call them 
and [ask], What is your opinion of the boy? (36) The mother of the 
girl says, Of course, now, we can't answer you right this very minute, 
even if the girl likes the boy, we can't answer you. (37) Be patient with 
us two or three days and we'll give you an answer. (38) I give them 
two or three days, again the mother calls me and says, Well, the girl 
likes the boy, and now [it's time] to ask [about him], we want to ask 
about him and all that, and they ask about him.

the old days they say with the old matches it [wasn't] like that.

(40) Now, us, our matchmaking now, this is the way it is. 
(41) In 
the old days [they} tell you she [the matchmaker} would praise her, 
you would find her [to be} not pretty, not beautiful, and she would 
raise her up to the sky (exaggerate in praising her) because in the old 
days [the groom} didn't used to see her, isn't that right? --- (42) Yeah, 
he didn't used to see her, in the old days he didn't used to see her, 
cross-eyed, blind, lame, [it was up to} him and his luck, they would 
bring her wrapped up, wrapped up in her abaya (cloak), no one knew 
anything about her, what she [was}. But now no, everything is (Jut in 
the open.

(3) Not like now, the girl works, the woman works, just like the man

with - that. (4) We in the time of the old days the mother-in-law, the 
keys [were] tied in [her] breast pocket, she would close [the door]. 
The mothers-in-law would lock the daughters-in-law in in the old days, 
and they would endure, hmm, in the old days, it was diferent. (5) In

the [one] outfit for the winter. That's all. (6) .. . Now, come [look], 
wherever you come, wherever you go, that old woman ... : Oh! [God] 
blast, the diabetes has gone [up], [the doctor] said this and the second 
doctor said that, and so forth. (7) And then [the old woman}" says, 
Didn't you see the Chabra Market? The box of apples is this big blah 
blah blah and the summer is such blah blah blah - just worries and 
complaints and illness. (8) That's us the old women. And the young 
people, Oh! Didn't you see the furniture in so-and-so's house? Oh! 
By God he wants to do better than me. (9) Didn't you see that - that 
style [furniture]? Well, I got it for ninety [dinars] ... Nowadays 
[everything is about] styles and furniture, and the old women are into

the old woman, her driver is standing by, her driver is standing by and 
all that, from the time she wakes up, today [she has] midmorning tea

(old woman) ... she raises that child, she cradles him, she washes him, 
she coddles him, hah, and the daughter-in-law cooks, cleans the house, 
washes, does [housework]. (13) Nowadays does an old woman hold 
the child? She doesn't hold him. By God she can't imagine [doing 
anything herself] - her driver is standing by. (J 4 ) Now, she takes from 
the [Bureau of Social] Affairs 100 dinars, see her, an Indian, a Filipino, 
a driver, three [servants]. (15) She takes from the [Bureau of Social]

[people] [used to let] girls study. The girl loves the boy, the boy loves 
the girl. Okay. (5) They came, they finished. They finished the 
University of Baghdad, they came [back). (6) This girl is in Basra, the 
boy is of the al-Zubayr. (7) The boy kept -- [the girl's family were] 
Christian, they wouldn't let -- they see him in love with their daughter, 
their daughter loves him, he comes and goes [visiting] her, they said, 
How [can we allow this]? (8) [The boy and girl] said, Let us get 
married. Fine. (9) They came [to do this], the boy came and askedfor 
her handfrom her father. Her father agreed; he said, If she wants you
