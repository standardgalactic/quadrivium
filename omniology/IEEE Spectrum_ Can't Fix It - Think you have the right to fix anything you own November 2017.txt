BACK STORY_
11.17
G
ROWING UP IN A SMALL TOWN near the northern Chinese 
city of Dalian, Zhenguo Yang dreamed of “designing cool 
cars.” At Jilin University in 1981, he applied to the automotive 
engineering program but was instead assigned to materials 
science and engineering. At the time, he notes, colleges in 
China could dictate a student’s major.
After graduating, Yang got a Ph.D. at the University of 
Connecticut and did a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon. In 
between his Ph.D. and postdoc, he worked in the car industry for 
several years, as a materials scientist focused on automotive parts 
design and materials processing. Along the way, he adopted the first 
name “Gary” after hearing Westerners struggle with his Chinese name. 
In 2001, he joined Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and his 
automotive dreams receded once again.
In 2007, Yang’s team at PNNL began studying energy storage 
technologies that could help promote the use of renewable energy. 
Eventually, the group settled on vanadium redox-flow batteries, 
or VRFBs, which had been invented in the 1980s but remained 
impractical. Several key breakthroughs by Yang’s team at PNNL 
seemed to finally make the technology viable. In 2012, Yang left the lab 
to cofound UniEnergy Technologies and commercialize VRFBs, which 
he writes about in this issue. 
“I didn’t plan to become an entrepreneur,” Yang says. “I was 49 years 
old. I already had a few gray hairs.” In the end, his desire to have a posi-
tive impact on society swayed him. Yang is quick to credit the “incred-
ible team” at PNNL and his startup company. Boyhood dreams may 
be well and good, but helping to create a greener, more reliable power 
grid has given him great satisfaction—“and a lot of gray hair,” he says.  □

Kyle Wiens 
In “The Fight to Fix It” [p. 24], Wiens 
of iFixit and Gay Gordon-Byrne of 
Repair.org argue that manufacturers should make 
repair information and parts more available. “It’s 
my life’s mission,” Wiens says, “fighting entropy 
and helping people to fix things.” A hundred million 
people visited iFixit’s website this past year, he 
notes, for one reason only. “People aren’t on a page 
describing how to replace the fan in an Xbox 360 
for entertainment.”
David C. Brock
Brock is a historian of technology and 
director of the Center for Software 
History at the Computer History Museum. In this 
issue, he delves into the origins of PowerPoint 
[p. 42]. In researching the software’s 30-year 
history, he was surprised to learn of its links 
to early 1970s visions of the office of the future. 
“I had no idea the interesting places it would 
lead,” says Brock, who also wrote this issue’s 
Past Forward [p. 56].
Katherine Bourzac
At conferences, freelance journalist 
Bourzac kept hearing how quantum com-
puters would revolutionize chemistry, but nobody 
ever gave specifics. After some digging, though, she 
learned that researchers hope to solve several big 
problems that have long stumped chemists [p. 7]. 
So why are they so vague when they talk about quan-
tum computing publicly? “I think they’re worried 
to tell theoretical chemists, ‘Here’s a problem you 
can’t solve, but we think we can,’ ” Bourzac says. 
Swarup Bhunia
Bhunia, a professor of electrical and 
computer engineering at the University 
of Florida, in Gainesville, Sandip Ray of NXP 
Semiconductors, and Abhishek Basak of Intel Labs 
are working to make hardware that’s destined for 
the Internet of Things more secure, as they discuss 
in this issue [p. 30]. Bhunia notes that he has smart 
lightbulbs, a smart thermostat, and a smart carbon-
monoxide detector in his home, so his interest is 
personal as well as professional.
CONTRIBUTORS_
Mark Anderson 
Anderson, an IEEE Spectrum contributing 
editor, is based in Massachusetts. In 
this issue, he writes about a researcher who’s 
investigating a little-known side of Albert Einstein: 
his life as an inventor [p. 19]. Asis Kumar Chaudhuri 
believes that Einstein’s efforts in refrigeration, 
audiology, and photography can give insight into 
the theorist. “Discovering Einstein’s storied career 
as a technologist helps us to see all sides of this 
icon of science,” says Anderson.

SPECTRUM.IEEE.ORG
eepak Aatresh, an electrical and computer engineer from India, 
joined Intel in 1989 as a chip designer—after reading an article 
I wrote for IEEE Spectrum on Intel’s project to build the first 
million-transistor chip! After seven years at Intel, he moved on to 
communications hardware companies. ¶  Then, in 2008, bitten 
by the startup bug but without a particular startup idea in mind, 
he joined Artiman Ventures as an entrepreneur-in-residence. He 
thought he’d try to find ways to reduce energy waste and improve 
energy efficiency. ¶ Although he didn’t know much about it at the start, 
he zeroed in on building construction because buildings consume huge 
amounts of energy. He taught himself how construction works, from site 
clearing to excavation to putting up a building. As part of his research, 
he watched a time-lapse video created from images taken by a camera 
mounted at a construction site, in which more than a year of work flicked 
by in minutes. ¶  “That’s when it hit me,” he says. “It’s just like we make 
silicon chips—first we etch away, and then we deposit layers. We have the 
same end process.” ¶ He knew that the two industries had very different 
design processes. But then he thought, why should they? Why shouldn’t 
buildings be designed the same way chips are designed, using automated 
tools, circuit libraries, simulation, and formal design verification? ¶ With 
Zigmund Rubel, he founded Aditazz to try to make a go of it. “My instinct was 
to make it a software play,” Aatresh says, meaning to build the design tools 
and sell the software. His software works in essentially the same way that 
chip design tools do. It has libraries of different space patterns (the design 
elements) and other rules—for example, the spatial elements that make 
up, say, an ultrasound room. “We can algorithmically adjust the design for 
the volume of patients or size of the foot-
print.” Essentially, Aatresh says, “we cre-
ate a functional description of a building, 
and use a compiler to build the design.”
Before going to market, Aditazz had 
to prove that its algorithms worked. The 
best way to do that was to start out as a 
service provider, bidding on contracts 
and designing great buildings using 
the new tools. (This approach is being 
embraced by other entrepreneurs; see 
my September View From the Valley post 
“Starting a Robotics Company? Sell a Ser-
vice, Not a Robot.”)
Aditazz decided to focus on the design 
and construction of hospitals and other 
health care facilities, reasoning that these 
are particularly difficult design prob-
lems that could benefit significantly from 
being approached with better tools.
So the company entered Kaiser Perma-
nente’s “Small Hospital, Big Idea” com-
petition. The challenge was to design a 
100-bed hospital that could be duplicated 
around the country. About 300 firms 
applied. Aditazz was one of two winners. 
Kaiser had initially planned to build several dozen 
hospitals based on the winning design, but due to 
uncertainty surrounding the U.S. Affordable Care 
Act, the project has not gone forward. The win still 
gave Aditazz credibility, however, and the firm is 
now focusing on China, where it is using its technol-
ogy to redesign a cancer hospital and research lab.
“Our approach,” says Aatresh, “started [by looking 
at] the incidents of cancer in their catchment area, 
to determine how many patients might need to be 
treated” at the Chinese site. As a result, Aditazz ended 
up with fewer beds than in an earlier design and a bet-
ter match between the patient population and the 
diagnostic, treatment, and outpatient areas, shrink-
ing the overall size of the proposed building by about 
30 percent.
The chip designer in him can’t help but be pleased 
with these results. “From a semiconductor perspec-
tive, if you can shrink the die size by 30 percent, that’s 
huge,” Aatresh says. “Power goes down, frequency 
goes up, cost goes down. You improve quality and 
reduce cost.” Very nice indeed.  —TEKLA S. PERRY

Someday, engineers 
will design large quan-
tum computers that can solve 
seemingly impossible science 
problems, crack unbreakable encryption, and make artificial 
intelligence smarter. In the meantime, the companies now 
building quantum computers are trying to figure out how to 
use the small ones they expect to produce in the coming years.
One field in which the first generation of quantum computers 
may be able to make headway is chemistry. Theoretical work 
suggests that such computers—perhaps even relatively small 
ones—will eventually be able to solve important problems in 
chemistry that are intractable on existing computers. 
But before they can take on chemistry’s big challenges like 
understanding photosynthesis and improving catalysts for mak-
ing renewable fuels, researchers must prove they can simulate 
small molecules and atoms. And so far, they haven’t gone far

beyond what a math-savvy chemist can 
do with a pen and paper.
A recent paper in the journal Nature 
took this work to the next level. Research-
ers at IBM described using a small quan-
tum computer to simulate complex 
molecules. The IBM team used six of the 
quantum bits (qubits) on a 7-qubit system 
to push into the second row of the peri-
odic table, simulating molecules as large 
as beryllium hydride (BeH2). 
What’s significant, says Jerry Chow, 
manager of experimental quantum com-
puting at IBM, is how they did it: by devel-
oping more sophisticated algorithms 
that could carry out the simulations on 
a small, noisy quantum computer.
Beryllium hydride is easy to simulate 
on a classical computer. It’s the kind of 
thing theoretical chemists like Markus 
Reiher call a “toy problem.” But this 
type of work is necessary to make use-
ful quantum computers “that can solve 
chemical problems where classical com-
putation reaches its limits,” says Reiher, 
who’s based at ETH Zurich. 
On a classical computer, the difficulty 
of chemical simulations scales exponen-
tially with the size of the problem. To do 
useful work, researchers make approxi-
mations, which works much of the time. 
But sometimes, quantum effects that are 
impossible to simulate are key to under-
standing the chemistry. Quantum com-
puters can represent quantum states, 
such as the energy levels of electrons, 
more naturally. So if companies can 
make a large quantum machine, they 
should be able to solve chemistry prob-
lems more exactly—and tackle problems 
that are currently impossible to solve.
When will quantum computers be able 
to solve a chemistry problem that classi-
cal computers can’t? We don’t know the 
answer yet. Today’s quantum computers 
have fewer than two dozen qubits. The 
more qubits engineers add, the more 
noise enters the system, and the harder 
it becomes to do anything useful. Google 
has announced that its team is working 
on a 49-qubit system that should out-
perform a classical computer on some 
(probably not particularly useful) tasks—
a milestone called quantum supremacy.
Some chemists suspect that solving 
important chemistry problems will 
require hundreds of thousands or mil-
lions of qubits, in order to correct errors 
that arise from noise. Other chemists—
including those working at IBM and 
Google—believe it will be possible to 
do useful chemistry with fewer than 
100 qubits. As they try to build larger 
systems, the big question for these com-
panies is, “How do you get value from 
a quantum computer in the next few 
years?” according to Jay Gambetta, who 
works on quantum computing and infor-
mation theory at IBM. 
The IBM team hopes the chemistry 
community will help them find out. The 
company has made a 16-qubit quantum 
computer accessible in the cloud, and 
it has posted quantum chemistry algo-
rithms that scientists can use to simu-
late small molecules.
Here are some of the chemistry prob-
lems scientists want to tackle with quan-
tum computers:
It takes a lot of energy to synthesize fer-
tilizer because the catalysts for convert-
ing nitrogen gas into ammonia work only 
at high temperatures and high pressure. 
For some bacteria, making ammonia 
with the enzyme nitrogenase is no sweat. 
Chemists want to learn the details of how 
nitrogenase works in order to mimic it. 
But the active site of nitrogenase, the 
part that interacts with nitrogen, can’t be 
modeled on classical computers. Other 
important biological enzymes, such as 
the one that performs the first step in 
photosynthesis, present a similar prob-
lem. Researchers at Microsoft estimate 
it would take up to a million qubits to 
simulate nitrogenase’s active site.
The active site of nitrogenase can’t be 
modeled on classical computers because 
it’s made up of transition metals. These 
metals, such as iron, cobalt, and plat-
inum, have many electrons. For this 
group of atoms in particular, chemists 
can’t afford to ignore quantum mechan-
ics in their simulations. Many catalysts, 
including those used to make chemicals 
and fuels, are also based on transition 
metals. Simulating the behavior of cata-
lysts on quantum computers could help 
chemists make them work faster at lower 
temperatures, or allow the substitution 
of less expensive metals.

GOOGLE is one of IBM’s ﬁercest 
competitors in the race to build 
real-world quantum computers. 
The company has promised a 
quantum computer with 49 qubits—
the number it says it will need to 
prove that quantum computers are 
superior to classical ones—by the 
end of the year.

Drug and alcohol users 
will soon be able to get a pre-
scription for a mobile app that could 
help them stay clean. Developed by 
Pear Therapeutics in Boston and 
San Francisco, the app helps peo-
ple recovering from addiction stay 
on track while participating in out-
patient treatment. The U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approved the prescription-only soft-
ware in September. 
The FDA’s decision marks the 
first time in the United States that 
software has been approved to 
treat disease, says Corey McCann, 
founder and CEO of Pear Therapeu-
tics. The company plans to make 
the digital therapeutic available 
commercially in 2018. 
The app, called reSET, is aimed 
at people with substance use disor-
ders involving alcohol, marijuana, 
cocaine, and stimulants. Patients 
who are prescribed the software 
must be involved in some type of 
outpatient treatment. Only a pre-
scription will enable the patient to 
unlock the app. 
Each week, the app prompts 
patients to respond to questions 
about their cravings and educates 
them about ways to deal with 
their addiction—a type of treat-
ment called cognitive behavioral 
therapy. “It’s very much like what 
patients would get face-to-face” 
with clinicians, says McCann.
Patients can use the app to report 
cravings and what they think is trig-
gering them, along with any slip-
ups. That information is sent to the 
patient’s clinician, who can view 
the activity on a back-end dash-
board. Clinicians can then use 
those reports to help patients iden-
tify behavioral patterns that might 
lead to relapse. 
The FDA based its approval largely 
on data from a 12-week clinical 
trial of 399 patients, who received 
either standard treatment or stan-
dard treatment with the addition 
of the software program. The study 
found that patients using the digital 
therapy had more than 20 percent 
greater adherence to the treatment 
program and abstinence from sub-
stances than patients undergoing 
standard treatment alone.
Pear Therapeutics spent at least 
US $20 million developing the soft-
ware program and testing it in clini-
cal trials. Now, to recoup that cost, 
the company must convince health 
insurance companies to see the 
value of the software and cover it 
in their medical insurance plans.

Superconductors are highly conduc-
tive materials, but they behave this 
way only at very low temperatures. 
Like transition metals, superconduc-
tors are difficult to model because of 
the quantum mechanical behavior of 
their electrons. Today superconduc-
tors are used to make qubits, as well 
as strong magnets for medical imag-
ing systems and particle accelerators. 
By modeling them on quantum com-
puters, researchers hope to figure out 
how to make superconductors that 
work at higher temperatures.  
To figure out the composition of far-
away galaxies, astronomers gather 
clues from the wavelengths of light 
those galaxies emit. Small quantum 
computers may enable researchers 
to more accurately determine what 
colors of light different types of mol-
ecules give off, a property called 
molecular spectra. Armed with this 
updated information, astronomers 
could learn more about faraway celes-
tial objects.

We’ve all been there. You’re driving 
down the highway, just as your naviga-
tion app instructed, when Siri tells you 
to “proceed east for one-half mile, then 
merge onto the highway.” But you’re already on 
the highway. After a moment of confusion and per-
haps some rude words about Siri and her extended 
AI family, you realize the problem: Your GPS isn’t 
accurate enough for your navigation app to tell 
if you’re on the highway or on the road beside it.
Those days are nearly at an end. At the Institute 
of Navigation GNSS+ conference in Portland, Ore., 
in September, Broadcom announced that it is pro-
viding customers samples of the first mass-market 
chip to take advantage of a new breed of global 
navigation satellite signals. This new chip will give 
the next generation of smartphones 30-centimeter 
accuracy as opposed to today’s 5 meters. Even bet-
ter, it works in a city’s concrete canyons, and it con-
sumes half the power of today’s generation of chips. 
The chip, the BCM47755, has been included in the 
design of some smartphones slated for release in 
2018, but Broadcom would not reveal which.
GPS and other global navigation satellite systems 
(GNSSs), such as Europe’s Galileo, Japan’s QZSS, and 
Russia’s Glonass, allow a receiver to determine its posi-
tion by calculating its distance from three or more 
satellites. All GNSS satellites—even the oldest genera-
tion still in use—broadcast a message called the L1 sig-
nal, which includes the satellite’s location, the time, 
and an identifying signature pattern. A newer gen-
eration broadcasts a more complex signal called L5 
Pear is developing additional 
apps for opioid abuse, schizo-
phrenia, post-traumatic stress 
disorder, generalized anxiety 
disorder, and other conditions. 
The company plans to apply for 
FDA approval for each addi-
tional program. 
In 2010, the FDA approved 
another prescription-only 
app, called BlueStar, for use 
by people with type 2 dia-
betes. BlueStar offers moti-
vational and educational 
messages, and it also makes 
suggestions, in real time, about 
when patients should test their 
blood sugar. But the app wasn’t 
approved to treat disease, so 
Pear Therapeutics had to forge 
its own regulatory pathway 
with the FDA to claim that 
reSET treats disease.
The prescription-only model 
could have drawbacks. “Mak-
ing medical apps available 
only by prescription would 
limit access to the people who 
need it and the overall pub-
lic health impact,” says Jona-
than Bricker, a scientist and 
smoking-cessation researcher 
at Fred Hutchinson Cancer 
Research Center, in Seattle. 
Indeed, the U.S. govern-
ment has posted a list of rec-
ommended quit-smoking apps 
that can be accessed without 
a prescription. And many 
groups have developed digital 
psychiatry software. Some 
of these medical apps have 
proven effective in rigorous 
testing, says Bricker, and “they 
don’t need FDA approval to be 
distributed because they pose 
no risk to the patient,” he says. 
But most apps on the mar-
ket lack clinical validation, 
so although they are avail-
able directly to the public, 
it’s unclear how well each 
one works. In 2015, research-
ers reviewed 14 depression 
apps endorsed by England’s 
publicly funded health care 
system, the National Health 
Service, and found that only 
two had been clinically vali-
dated. Prior to their review, 
a slew of other reports had 
also found that mental health 
apps lack rigorous testing. 
“Ultimately, digital thera-
peutics will likely play out 
much like drugs versus nutri-
tional supplements,” says 
McCann. In his view, apps 
designed to treat disease 
should require a prescrip-
tion because patients could 
be at risk if they download 
untested apps to manage a 
serious illness instead of vis-
iting a doctor. For these apps, 
a “physician prescription [is] 
critical for patient safety,” 
he says. Apps that address 
wellness issues such as 
smoking cessation may 
not require the same level 
of scrutiny, McCann says.

SKINNY SIGNALS: To be accurate, receivers need the signal that takes the shortest path 
from the satellite [green]. Classic L1 satellite signals overlap with their reﬂections [blue and 
purple] to form signal “blobs,” which mask the shortest path. L5 signals don’t overlap with 
their reﬂections, so receivers can easily ﬁnd the signal that arrives ﬁrst.
is looking for the peak of that blob 
to fix the time of arrival. But the 
messier the blob, the less accurate 
that fix, and the less accurate the 
final calculated position will be.
However, L5 signals are so 
sharp that the reflections are 
unlikely to overlap with the most 
direct signal. The receiver chip 
can simply ignore any signal after 
the first one it receives, which 
is the shortest path. The Broad-
com chip also uses information 
embedded in the phase of the car-
rier signal to improve accuracy.
Although there are advanced 
systems that use L5 on the mar-
ket now, these are generally for 
industrial purposes, such as 
oil and gas exploration. Broadcom’s 
BCM47755 is the first mass-market chip 
that uses L1 and L5.
Why is this only happening now? “Up 
to now there haven’t been enough L5 sat-
ellites in orbit,” says Manuel del Castillo, 
associate director of GNSS product mar-
keting at Broadcom. At this point, there 
are about 30 such satellites in orbit, 
counting a set that flies only over Japan 
and Australia. Even in a city’s “narrow 
window of sky you can see six or seven, 
which is pretty good,” del Castillo says. 
“So now is the right moment to launch.”
Broadcom had to get the improved 
accuracy to work within a smartphone’s 
limited power budget. Fundamentally,

at a different frequency in addition to the 
legacy L1 signal. The receiver essentially 
uses these signals to fix its distance from 
each satellite based on how long it takes 
the signal to go from satellite to receiver.
Broadcom’s receiver first locks onto 
the satellite with the L1 signal and then 
refines its calculated position with the L5. 
The latter is superior, especially in cities, 
because it’s much less prone to distor-
tions from multipath reflections than L1.
In a city, the satellite’s signals reach the 
receiver both directly and by bouncing off 
one or more buildings. The direct signal 
and any reflections arrive at slightly differ-
ent times, and if they overlap, they add up 
to form a sort of signal blob. The receiver 
that came down to three things: moving 
to a more power-efficient 28-nanometer-
chip manufacturing process, adopting 
a new radio architecture (which Broad-
com would not disclose the details of), 
and designing a power-saving dual-core 
sensor hub. In total, they add up to a 
50 percent power savings over the com-
pany’s previous, less accurate chip. 
The BCM47755 is just the latest devel-
opment in a global push for centimeter-
level navigation accuracy. Bosch, Geo++, 
Mitsubishi Electric, and U-blox established 
a joint venture called Sapcorda Services in 
August to work toward that goal. Sapcorda 
seems to depend on using ground stations 
to measure errors in GPS and Galileo satel-
lite signals due to atmospheric distortions. 
Those measurements would then be sent 
to receivers in handsets and other systems 
to improve accuracy.
Japan’s US $1.9 billion Quasi-Zenith Sat-
ellite System (QZSS) also relies on error 
correction, but it further improves on 
urban navigation by adding a set of satel-
lites, guaranteeing that one of them is vis-
ible directly overhead, even in the densest 
part of Tokyo. The third of those four sat-
ellites launched in August. A fourth was 
planned for October, and the system is 
scheduled to come on line in 2018.
Competing GNSS chipmakers have not 
announced mass-market L1/L5 chips for 
smartphones, but some are working on 
similar products. U-blox says it is working 
on a dual radio chip but would not give 
details; Qualcomm says it will be deliver-
ing products “soon.” STMicroelectronics, 
as a member of a research consortium 
called the European Safety Critical Appli-
cations Positioning Engine, is working on 
a mass-market chip for the automotive 
sector. The chip will take advantage of 
the Galileo satellites’ new spoof-proof sig-
nals, which begin broadcasting in 2018.

Despite innovative off-grid tech-
nology and high-profile initiatives, 
electrification in sub-Saharan Africa still 
trails population growth. In 2009 there 
were 585 million people in the region 
without power. Five years later, that fig-
ure had risen to 632 million, accord-
ing to the latest International Energy 
Agency statistics.
A first-of-its-kind analysis of the flow 
of capital, released in September by the 
United Nations’ Sustainable Energy for 
All program, shows that off-grid sys-
tems simply are not getting the support 
they deserve. 
“This research shows that only 1 per-
cent of financing for electrification 
is going into this very promising and 
dynamic energy solution,” says pro-
gram CEO Rachel Kyte, who calls the 
findings “a wake-up call” to the inter-
national community. 
The 20 countries targeted in the U.N. 
report account for 80 percent of the esti-
mated 1.06 billion people around the 
globe living without electricity. The report 
found that total investment in electricity 
infrastructure averaged US $19.4 billion a 
NEWS
OFF-GRIDELECTRICITY 
PROJECTSARESTARVED 
FOR FUNDS
Despite the promise of off-grid solar, 99 percent of 
funding still goes to grid projects
year in 2013 and 2014 (the latest year with 
full statistics). Of that, only $200 million 
per year was dedicated to off-grid systems.
This is “alarming,” the authors write, 
considering off-grid solar’s “enormous 
promise” to rapidly and cheaply deliver 
basic electrical services compared with 
the ability of traditional grids. The Interna-
tional Energy Agency estimates that 70 per-
cent of rural electrification is best achieved 
by off-grid systems, including solar. 
The report does note a few hopeful 
developments: The World Bank this year 
committed $150 million to rural off-grid 
renewable projects in Kenya, and com-
panies installing pay-as-you-go off-grid 
solar systems raised $223 million last year.
Even those solar enterprises, however, 
face an enduring “grid is best” mental-
ity. “Most of the political actors in this 
sphere still believe that the ‘real’ power 
is the national grid,” says Daniel Becker, 
founder of Rafiki Power, a company that 
has built minigrids in Tanzania and wants 
to invest throughout East Africa.
Becker says vague plans for extending 
national power grids also create a barrier 
to off-grid developers. “No one wants to 
give you money to build a minigrid where 
the government says the grid will be there 
in five years,” he says.
Other financing hang-ups relate to 
project scale and revenue expectations. 
Lenders and governments are only will-
ing to support projects providing about 
10,000 electrical connections, Becker says, 
whereas Rafiki’s modeling predicts that 
cost-saving economies of scale start to kick 
in after 200,000 to 300,000 connections.
And then there is the matter of funders’ 
expectations that off-grid investments will 
be paid back with fees from rural consum-
ers. That contradicts the history of electri-
fication in major economies, where urban 
consumers subsidized power-grid exten-
sions to the hinterlands. “If the govern-
ment plan is to electrify certain regions, 
they need to subsidize part,” says Elham 
Ibrahim, the African Union’s Commis-
sioner for Infrastructure and Energy. 
Andy Schroeter, whose Laos-based 
firm Sunlabob Renewable Energy has 
been an off-grid rural electrification pio-
neer since 2001, echoes Becker’s views. 
For over a decade, he says, international 
lenders have prioritized low cost over 
long-term sustainability, resulting in 
shoddy systems that lack local support.
 In Myanmar, international investment 
in electrification has risen sharply in 
recent years amid democratic reforms. 
Sunlabob recently completed a Japa-
nese government-funded project there, 
installing 11 village minigrids at a price of 
$8.20 per watt of peak solar generation. 
But Schroeter says award values have 
crashed, noting that a recent minigrid 
project in Myanmar backed by the 
World Bank was awarded to a bidder 
for $4.20 per watt. “For this price, you 
really can’t come up with a long-lasting 
project. It’s impossible,” says Schroeter.

WIRED

WHAT IF WE PUT ALL 
the electric-vehicle 
innovations that 
automakers have been 
introducing piecemeal 
into one car? Well, it 
happened, and here's 
the result. Instead of 
a steering wheel, this 
research vehicle, called 
the SpeedE, has a side-
stick steering system 
electronically connected 
to actuators that enable 
the wheels to turn 
completely sideways. The 
designers, led by a team 
from the Institute for 
Automotive Engineering 
at RWTH Aachen 
University, in Germany, 
also incorporated drive-
by-wire and brake-by-
wire systems to eliminate 
the heavy mechanical 
components that 
normally control speed. 
In their place are wires 
that link the accelerator 
to motors at the rear axle 
and link the brake pedal 
to four electrohydraulic 
brake actuators. The 
actuators kick in to slow 
the vehicle, maintain 
stability control, and turn 
some of the kinetic energy 
of the car’s momentum 
into electricity, which 
is returned to the 
EV’s batteries.

RANDI KLETT
hen I first learned to solder, I did so using a cheap iron, not realizing
how atrocious such things are. It wasn’t until several years later that I purchased a 
temperature-controlled soldering station. These use thermal feedback to keep the tip 
at a set temperature, and I soon learned that good solder joints are easy to make when you have 
good equipment. I’ve had that very same Weller WTCPN soldering station for almost four decades now, having forsaken non-temperature-
controlled irons completely.  This stance on soldering irons did, however, put me in a quandary recently when I started to explore the 
options for cordless soldering irons. Cordless irons are essential for those times when you need to solder something and there’s no power 
outlet available. Yet I could not ﬁnd a cordless iron for sale that had temperature control. So I ﬁgured I’d build myself one.  My fondness 
for my faithful Weller soldering station dictated the ﬁrst design criterion—it had to provide the same quality temperature control—and also 
suggested a strategy to attain that goal: Weller’s Magnastat system. Let me explain. Weller long ago devised a clever way to provide tem-
perature feedback and control without using any electronics. It’s based on the physics of ferromagnetic materials, which lose their mag-
netism when heated above a certain temperature, known as the Curie point. Weller’s Magnastat system uses three magnetic components 
near the tip: two inside a normally open switch, the other built into the tip itself. The components inside the switch (one movable) have a 
very high Curie point, whereas the one in the tip has a Curie point equal to the desired soldering temperature.  When the iron is cold,

a movable permanent magnet in the switch 
is drawn to the ferromagnetic tip, closing 
the switch and sending power to the heat-
ing element. The tip then gets hot. When 
the magnet in the tip exceeds its Curie tem-
perature and loses its magnetism, the mov-
able magnet shifts toward the ﬁxed one in 
the switch, causing the switch to open and 
shutting off power. When the tip cools be-
low its Curie point, it is magnetized by vir-
tue of the field from the nearby movable 
magnet, which is then drawn to it, closing 
the switch and reapplying power. Presto—
temperature feedback!
For my cordless iron, I duplicated this sys-
tem by ordering some Magnastat replace-
ment parts from Mouser Electronics: the 
magnetic switch, the heating element, a tip, 
and the barrel used to hold the tip on. The 
challenge was to supply the tip with 24 volts 
or so. My Weller soldering station contains 
a massive transformer that runs off a wall 
socket, whereas my cordless iron would ob-
viously need to run off batteries.
You could easily take an entire 
Magnastat soldering iron and 
power it with a couple of 12-volt 
lead-acid batteries. But I was aim-
ing for something more portable. 
That’s when it occurred to me to 
package my cordless iron into 
another piece of equipment I’m 
fond of: a Maglite ﬂashlight. 
Maglites are made of nicely 
machined and anodized alumi-
num with attractive knurling. I 
purchased a non-LED, two-D-
cell model at a nearby hardware 
store and took it apart, which re-
quired purchasing a replacement 
switch for the ﬂashlight so I could 
get the needed Torx wrench.
Of course, two D batteries would pro-
vide only a meager 3 volts. But this flash-
light offers sufﬁcient space for six 14500 
lithium-ion cells, which together can pro-
vide about 22 volts. After considerable 
digging, I found a source for a three-cell 
holder for AA batteries that puts them in 
series and is about the size of a D battery. 
So all I needed to do was to purchase two 
such holders and outﬁt them with 14500 
lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, which 
are about the size of AA cells.
The difﬁculty here is that I wanted to use 
protected lithium-ion cells. These have 
a little bit of circuitry built in that handles 
problems like overcharging or short cir-
cuits, which can cause lithium-ion batter-
ies to do unpleasant things, like bursting 
into ﬂame. These cells tend to be a little long 
because the protection circuit awkwardly 
adds to their length. (Flashlight enthusi-
asts, it seems, run into this problem a lot.) 
My solution was to purchase six Xtar cells, 
which are a little shorter than most 14500s. 
I was happy I did that because they ﬁt into 
my holders perfectly.
These 800-milliampere-hour cells are 
nominally rated for only 1.6 amperes, but 
that’s the most they’d need to supply for 
all but perhaps a few tens of seconds in a 
charge cycle. And a very helpful online re-
viewer showed that their protection circuits 
don’t kick in until almost 3 A, which is higher 
than my soldering iron would ever need.
Usually packaging a DIY gizmo is the hard-
est part. But marrying the Weller Magnastat 
technology with a Maglite ﬂashlight proved 
remarkably easy. It required drilling just ﬁve 
holes into two aluminum disks purchased on 
eBay for US $1 each. The disks take the place 
of the clear plastic lens of the ﬂashlight and 
provide a sturdy and heat-insensitive surface 
onto which to mount the heating element. All 
that was left was to make four solder connec-
tions (to the flashlight contacts and a 5-A 
fuse), connect the Magnastat components 
with wire nuts, and put the disassembled 
ﬂashlight back together. I turned it on, and 
soon made a perfect solder joint with my new 
cordless iron.  —DAVID SCHNEIDER

INGO WAGNER/DPA/AP
lbert Einstein is a legend for 
his breakthroughs in theoretical 
physics, but sometimes even the 
most abstract theorists have a practical side. 
In collaboration with other scientists and 
technologists throughout his career, Einstein 
also ﬁled patents and promoted practical in-
ventions that included a refrigerator, a hear-
ing aid, and a camera. 
One retired research scientist has taken 
a particular interest in Einstein’s forays into 
engineering: Asis Kumar Chaudhuri, who 
had worked at the Variable Energy Cyclotron 
Centre, in Kolkata, India. He’s not the ﬁrst to 
note Einstein’s rather mixed record as an 
inventor, and Chaudhuri acknowledges that 
none of Einstein’s contributions to technol-
ogy ranks with E = mc2, but he believes the 
man’s brilliance—and humanity—still shines 
through and his inventions deserve to 
be remembered.
“If you read between the lines and read the 
stories behind his inventions, you’ll find a

WANTS EINSTEIN’S 
ENGINEERING EFFORTS TO BE 
BETTER KNOWN
sympathetic man,” a human who is troubled 
by others’ bad fortune, Chaudhuri says. 
In 1926, Einstein read a newspaper article 
about an entire family in Germany that had 
been killed by a leak from their refrigera-
tor. Refrigerators at the time used lethal 
gases, such as methyl chloride and sulfur 
dioxide, as coolants. Einstein reached out 
to his friend the young Hungarian physicist 
Leo Szilard (who would later be the ﬁrst to 
realize that chain reactions could liberate 
huge amounts of nuclear energy) to find 
an alternative. 
Einstein and Szilard’s design used a me-
tallic ﬂuid moved back and forth by an elec-
tromagnetic pump that eliminated gaskets 
and seals. Ultimately, Chaudhuri notes, 
there were 45 patent applications ﬁled for 
the Einstein-Szilard refrigerator technology 
in six countries. Yet no commercial prod-
uct emerged from the flurry of paperwork 
and prototypes. However, in 2008 the idea 
was revived as a possible low-maintenance 
technology for developing markets. And last 
year a British inventor adapted the Einstein-
Szilard design to make an electricity-free 
refrigerator to keep vaccines cool in hot cli-
mates for up to 30 days. 
Back in 1928, Einstein continued try-
ing his hand at technology by collaborating 
with German engineer Rudolf Goldschmidt. 
Their goal was to develop a hearing aid that 
could assist Einstein’s friend, the singer Olga 
Eisner, who had become hard of hearing. 
Einstein and Goldschmidt’s idea was to 
use the magnetorestrictive property of some 
materials in which a magnetic ﬁeld alters the 
shape of the material in a reversible way. In 
the case of the hearing aid, electriﬁed coils 
would alter the length of rods and so vibrate 
a diaphragm to produce sound. The two ap-
plied for a patent for this nascent hearing 
aid technology in 1929. However, they had 
to abandon their work as the rise of Hitler led 
both men to ﬂee Germany.
Not long after Einstein arrived in the United 
States, he struck up a friendship with the doc-
tor who was treating his ailing wife, Elsa, and 
this led to Einstein’s last major foray into prac-
tical invention. Gustav Bucky was a German-
American radiologist who had previously 
invented X-ray blur-reduction technology. In 
1935, Bucky and Einstein filed a patent ap-
plying the physics that won Einstein his Nobel 
prize. The proposed Einstein-Bucky camera 
used the photoelectric effect to automatically 
adjust the exposure of the film in a camera 
depending on light levels. Light striking a 
photoelectric cell would produce a current 
proportional to the intensity of the light, and 
this was used to move a screen with regions of 
varying transparency across the ﬁlm accord-
ingly. Once again, the invention went nowhere.
Chaudhuri says that despite their com-
mercial failure in Einstein’s lifetime, these in-
ventions provide an important window into 
understanding the great scientist. “He was 
really a reasoning man,” Chaudhuri says. “But 
he was not just a theoretical physicist living in 
his ivory tower either.”  —MARK ANDERSON

THE DEAD TVs OF NYC
A PHOTOGRAPHER CAPTURES THE 
LAST TRACES OF AN OBSOLETE 
TECHNOLOGY
Stephen Cass: What provoked you to 
create Screen Saver?
Tom Starkweather: I started noticing in 
2015 that there were a lot more of these 
TVs being left out on the street, or in the gar-
bage area of buildings. I thought it was just 
because of people upgrading their televi-
sions. But I did a little more research, and I 
found out that the state made a law that you 
can’t dispose of televisions with the nor-
mal waste; they have to either be taken to a 
recycling center or it’s on the manufacturer 
to take them back. Of course, some of these 
television companies no longer exist, and 
from a building manager perspective they 
keep them together and then [dispose of 
them all at once]. But I’ve seen some of them 
hang out for six months. I saw one yesterday 
that’s been there for a year! 
And those televisions—at least those with 
that kind of cathode-ray tube and big, bulg-
ing back—are not something you’re going to 
see as much of in the future. So I started pho-
tographing. I have hundreds of pictures of 
these TVs.
S.C.: How does this relate to your earlier 
pay phone photographs?
T.S:. I’m inﬂuenced by photographers from 
the ’60s and ’70s in New York. What I get out 
of looking at some of their photographs is the 
things that might have seemed ordinary at the 
time and now really stand out as [part of] a dif-
ferent era.... Things are going to change as 
VERY JANUARY AT CES, IN LAS VEGAS, IEEE SPECTRUM
editors ﬁnd themselves strolling through enormous 
cathedrals of television: Multistory facades of lumines-
cent images ﬂood the eye from screen after screen. At press conferences, 
the manufacturers try to outdo one another with razzmatazz presenta-
tions as their latest wares make their glitzy debuts before heading out into 
showrooms around the world.  ǑPhotographer Tom Starkweather is inter-
ested in the utter antithesis of what happens at CES.He recently published 
Screen Saver, a hand-bound book featuring oddly compelling photographs 
of televisions discarded in the streets and yards of New York City. Devices 
that would have once been the literal center of attention now lie abandoned, 
with the images on their screens formed only by the reﬂections of their sur-
roundings. (Starkweather has also chronicled the fading presence of the 
pay phone.) Spectrum senior editor Stephen Cass spoke to him about his 
fascination for the public fate of yesterday’s technologies.

society progresses, and technology is a huge 
inﬂuence on how things are changing. The pay 
phone project started in a similar way, where 
I just started collecting as many as I could. It 
was something I started right after I moved to 
the city. I hadn’t seen so many pay phones in 
one place, but I realized, “Oh, wow, there’s a 
lot of them, and they’re not going to be here in 
the future.” In some ways, you’re trying to pre-
dict how things are going to change. But with 
the pay phones and the TVs, it’s pretty obvious.
S.C.: What tech are you currently 
tracking?
T.S.: I photograph cash whenever I see any-
one who has cash. Newspapers, things like 
that, things I don’t believe are going to exist 
in the physical form they currently do.
S.C.: How do you approach composing 
photographs of what’s generally con-
sidered junk?
T.S.: It’s like, “How do you make garbage 
interesting?” I didn’t really think about the 
reﬂections until much later, when I was review-
ing what I had shot. But I started noticing the re-
ﬂections being an interesting component. The 
TVs used to have so many different images on 
them, but now they’re static, unless something 
moves in the reﬂection.
S.C.: What was the motivation in making 
a physical book instead of just, say, a nice 
website?
T.S.: I’ve been into bookmaking since I took a 
class in college on making editioned books. I 
make the whole thing in my apartment. I print 
it myself; the binding is a simple staple binding. 
But I ﬁnd it’s a good way to chronicle the events 
of a year or a particular project. And I actually 
felt a lot of pressure to put that book together 
because I started noticing other people photo-
graphing the TVs! They were out there. People 
are going to take pictures of them. A neighbor 
from a different neighborhood saw my project 
and bought my book because he had been run-
ning a blog himself about it!

IT’S IN THE CARDS: India will soon supplant China as the world’s 
most populous country. The question is whether India will also rise 
to challenge China as an economic powerhouse.   At least since the 
unraveling of the Roman Empire, successive Chinese dynasties have 
ruled over more people than any other government. China had about 428 million
people in 1912, when imperial rule ended; 542 million in 1949, when the Commu-
nists took power; 1.27 billion by the year 2000; and about 1.41 billion by mid-2017. 
The slowing growth rate is the direct result of the one-child policy, adopted in 1979 
and ended in 2015. Meanwhile, India’s population expanded from 356 million in 
1950 to 1.05 billion in 2000 and to 1.31 billion in 2016.  China’s edge comes to 
just 7 percent, a mere 100 million people—about the population of the Philippines. 
And, given the reliability of short-term demographic forecasts, it’s clear that India 
will surpass China’s total before 2025, perhaps as early as 2023.  Meanwhile, it is 
fascinating to compare the two giga-states. Both countries selectively abort many 
girls, creating abnormal sex ratios at birth. The normal ratio is 1.06 males per one 
female, but India stands at 1.12, China at 1.15.  Both countries are riddled with 
corruption: The latest Corruption Perceptions Index, from Transparency Inter-
national, puts them both at 79th place among the 176 included countries (with 
Denmark at the top and Somalia at the bottom). In both countries the economic 
inequality, as measured by the Gini index, is over 35 and (given the poor data) it 
might have moved much higher still. And in both countries the moneyed classes 
compete in ostentatious consumption, collecting expensive cars and palatial 
residences. Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries Limited, owns the 
world’s most expensive private residence; it has a perfect view of Mumbai’s slums.
But there are fundamental differ-
ences. Rapid economic growth since 
1980 has made China by far the richer 
of the two, with a nominal GDP nearly 
five times that of India (US $11.2 trillion 
versus $2.3 trillion). China’s per capita 
average, measured in terms of purchas-
ing power parity, was more than twice 
as high ($15,400 versus $6,600). 
On the other hand, China is a tightly 
controlled one-party state run by a 
politburo of seven aged men, while 
India continues as a highly imperfect 
but undeniably democratic polity. Free-
dom House assigns India 77 points on its 
freedom index compared with a measly 
15 points for China. The United States 
gets 89, Canada 99.
Another comparison is equally reveal-
ing: One of China’s top high-tech achieve-
ments is to employ ferocious censorship
of the Internet; one of India’s great high-
tech achievements is its disproportion-
ate contribution to high-tech corporate 
leadership at home and abroad. Many 
Indian emigrants have risen to leader-
ship in Silicon Valley—Sundar Pichai 
at Google, Satya Nadella at Microsoft, 
Shantanu Narayen at Adobe, and Sanjay 
Jha at GlobalFoundries, to name a few.
It will be fascinating to see to what 
extent India can replicate China’s eco-
nomic success. China, for its part, must 
cope with its loss of the demographic 
dividend, manifest in an aging popula-
tion. Since 2012, China’s dependency 
ratio—the number of people of work-
ing age divided by the number of those 
who are too young or too old to work—
has been rising. The question is whether 
the country will become old before it can 
become truly rich.
One last complication: These two 
nuclear powers have yet to sign a bind-
ing treaty to end their territorial dis-
agreement in the Himalayas. They’ve 
come to blows over the matter, most 
notably in 1962. Things can get touchy 
when rising powers sit athwart a dis-
puted border.  ■

IN THE MOST RECENT SEASONof the TV comedy“SiliconValley,” 
lead character Richard Hendricks is obsessed with trying to cre-
ate his dream vision of a decentralized Internet. This theme did 
not go unnoticed in the print media, as a number of publications, 
including IEEE Spectrum, noted that there do exist ongoing efforts to build 
a decentralized Internet. This provoked me to consider the relative advan-
tages of centralization and decentralization Until the 1980s, most commu-
nication networks were relatively centralized. In the United States, AT&T 
had a monopoly that was regulated by the government. Connections were 
dedicated, point-to-point channels, and the attachment of foreign devices 
(meaning anything not manufactured by AT&T’s Western Electric Co. subsid-
iary) was forbidden. I remember with embarrassment my testimony at the 
federal antitrust trial, trying halfheartedly to justify AT&T’s fallback strategy 
of allowing digital connections to such devices via a Western Electric “data 
coupler.”The antitrust trial resulted in the dismantling of AT&T. At the same 
time, the rise of the Internet was causing centralized communication net-
works to unravel. The Internet was designed to be open and decentralized. 
Packet switching ensured robustness, and the Internet Protocol enforced 
open and universal interconnection. The end-to-end principle—whereby 
the network’s job is simply to move data from one point to another while 
making the existence of all the points in between as invisible as possible—
became a guiding philosophy of network transparency. After almost 
a half century, the plumbing of the Internet is still decentralized, but 
the overlay of the World Wide Web is not. A handful of giant companies 
has virtual monopoly control of traffic 
and commerce. And governments censor 
the Web, control access, and are one of 
many sources of surveillance. But, I ask 
myself, Is Hendricks’s peer-to-peer net-
work the answer to these ills?
We technologists have some powerful 
tools to create distributed systems, includ-
ing mesh networks, peer-to-peer protocols, 
cryptography, and blockchains. Ongoing 
efforts like blockchain-based Ethereum
offer exciting potential. One review asked 
readers to imagine “facebook without 
Facebook, uber without Uber.” This is 
possible, but it does seem rather unlikely.
In a way, we’ve been there, done that. 
Napster was a peer-to-peer network not 
unlike Hendricks’s. For a while it was a 
supernova on the Net, but it had a cen-
tral directory and thus someone to sue, 
and is no more. BitTorrent, however, also 
employs a peer-to-peer protocol and has 
been widely used for quite a few years.
Richard Hendricks envisions his peer-to-
peer network storing data on a distributed 
swarm of cellphones. I’ve been wonder-
ing about this. Do I want my data stored on 
random cellphones? I’d have no problem 
if it were transient data or entertainment 
files, but what about my family photos? Ten 
years from now, when the photos might 
be wanted, all those cellphones would be 
gone. The data would have probably been 
erased years earlier. The problem with 
systems implemented with peers is that 
no one is responsible. Whom do you call 
when your mesh network is out? Or who, 
ultimately, stands behind a blockchain?
On the other hand, distributed architec-
tures have an engineering appeal. They 
offer organic growth and resilience and 
are a cradle for democratic usage and con-
trol. Sometimes having no one in charge 
can be a good thing. However, as legal 
scholarLarry Lessig has pointed out, regu-
lation is achieved through four means: law, 
norms, market, and architecture. We engi-
neers usually control only one of these, 
and that’s something we should always 
keep in mind. □

T
HE CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION estimated that residents of 
the United States bought 183 million smartphones in 2016. There are already as 
many TVs in this country as there are people. That’s a lot of electronics, and these 
numbers are just going up. ¶ On balance, all this technology is probably making 
our lives better. But there’s a downside, too: The stuff often malfunctions. Unlike 
the 30-year-old mixer on your kitchen counter that refuses to die, new technology—
especially the smart devices with fancy, embedded electronics—breaks more quickly. 
That trend, confirmed by a recent study by the German government, applies not just to delicate prod-
ucts like smartphones and tablets but also to equipment we would expect to last for a long time—
like televisions, washing machines, and even tractors.
Manufacturers would prefer to sell 
you their latest models rather than 
repair your old electronics, so they 
work to make fixing their products 
too expensive or too impractical. It’s 
a global problem because the market-
place for technology is global, and peo-
ple everywhere are affected. With so 
many people throwing out so much bro-
ken stuff, it should come as no surprise 
that e-waste is the fastest-growing waste 
stream, with tens of millions of tons 
discarded annually around the world.
Tossing things out instead of fixing 
them has far-reaching consequences—
for consumers, for the economy, and 
for the environment. Indeed, a future 
in which nothing ever gets repaired isn’t 
bright for anyone except the people 
trying to sell you new products. And 
many of us are not prepared to accept 
that future without a fight.
In 2013, a group of concerned con-
sumers, recyclers, refurbishers, envi-
ronmentalists, digital-rights advocates, 
and repair specialists in the United 
States teamed up to found Repair.org, 
of which one of us (Gordon-Byrne) is 
executive director and the other (Wiens) 
is chairman of the board. We’re work-
ing to make sure that when something 
breaks, U.S. consumers can easily find 
the information and parts they need 
to repair it, or else have it repaired by 
whomever they choose.
Over the past few years, this battle 
has been heating up. In 2017, twelve 
states introduced “right to repair” leg-
islation that would make it easier for

That scarcity is by design. Manufacturers don’t want you to 
fix that broken microwave or air conditioner; they want you 
to buy a new one. Some even send cease-and-desist letters 
to people who post repair information online. Back in 2012, 
Toshiba told laptop repair tech Tim Hicks that he needed to 
remove 300 PDFs of Toshiba’s official repair manuals from 
his website, where he was offering the information for free. 
To avoid being sued, Hicks complied, and now fewer people 
have the guidance they need to repair Toshiba laptops.
Toshiba isn’t the only guilty party. Go to Apple’s website 
and try to find a repair manual for a MacBook Pro. It’s not 
there. Go to Samsung’s website and look for ways to fix your 
flat-screen TV. You’ll come away empty-handed. Same for 
your Keurig. Or your Kindle. Or your GoPro. Or your  Lexmark 
printer that’s always broken. You’ll probably find user man-
uals and perhaps a few other online resources created by 
people who figured out how to fix the broken product on 
their own. But manufacturers by and large remain silent on 
the topic of repair.
Instead, they put official service information and diagnos-
tic tools behind passwords and paywalls, limiting the dis-
tribution of repair information to a select few “authorized” 
providers. Without access to repair instructions, customers 
are forced to use these authorized service centers, which 
can charge high prices because there are no alternatives—
except perhaps buying a new device. 
That’s why one of us (Wiens) created iFixit, a company 
that takes apart popular models of consumer electronics to 
reverse-engineer repair instructions and then posts the infor-
mation for free online. The instructions come from iFixit, not 
the manufacturer, so iFixit can’t be sued for disseminating 
proprietary repair information. 
consumers to fix broken digital equipment. With grassroots 
support, Repair.org is leading the charge to turn these bills 
into laws. Not surprisingly, we’ve encountered significant 
resistance, not from lawmakers but from lobbyists hired 
by large tech companies to kill right-to-repair bills behind 
closed doors. 
You might think that these legislative battles are inconse-
quential or don’t have too much to do with you personally. 
But if you believe that when you buy something you actually 
own it, you should pay attention as we explain why that may 
not be the case and give the history of how we got to today’s 
very odd situation.
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FIXING ELECTRONIC DEVICES 
for as long as they have existed. You know the drill: When 
something breaks, you troubleshoot the problem, take the 
thing apart, fix or replace the failed component or subassembly, 
and turn the machine back on. If it works, great. If not, try 
again. It’s as simple as that.
The trouble with repairing computerized products—a category 
that just keeps growing and includes pretty much anything you 
plug into the wall or run off a battery these days—is that the 
path to repair isn’t always so straightforward. Sometimes it’s 
easy to see that a connection has come loose or that a capaci-
tor has gone bad, but for the most part identifying and correct-
ing the underlying problem requires sophisticated diagnostic 
tools and detailed service documentation. If the manufacturer 
refuses to provide those things, repair is still possible, but it’s 
a lot more difficult. Every repair becomes an R&D project. 
In past decades, companies that made electronic equipment 
typically provided the information needed for repair—and usually 
free of charge. Computers came 
with schematic diagrams showing 
how the various components on 
the circuit boards were connected. 
Even Apple, now one of the most 
repair-unfriendly gadget makers in 
the business, sent a free, exhaustive 
manual—complete with schematics—
to owners of the Apple II. It was 
expected that many owners would 
repair and maybe even tinker with 
their equipment.
But as the years went on, this 
kind of information became 
scarcer. It’s ironic. We live in 
the age of information. And 
yet, at the very moment when 
information about how to repair 
electronics should be easiest for 
owners to get their hands on, it 
has dried up.

Even if you happen to find repair 
instructions on iFixit’s website or else-
where, you still have to locate replace-
ment parts. In some cases, parts are 
so difficult to get from the manufac-
turer that people instead extract them 
from junked equipment, as if they were 
harvesting organs from the recently 
deceased. Things are even harder for 
small repair shops, which struggle to 
find reliable sources of high-quality 
replacement parts.
The lack of service parts is an espe-
cially big impediment when it comes 
to repairing smartphones, tablets, and 
gaming devices. Together, those prod-
ucts number in the billions, and yet 
many models have no independent 
sources for fragile items like glass. 
That’s crazy because glass, of course, 
breaks frequently. Fixing it is a big 
business for phone manufacturers like 
Apple and Samsung, which are fighting 
vigorously to protect their monopolies 
on repair. As of September 2014, gad-
get insurance company SquareTrade 
estimated that Americans had spent 
US $10.7 billion on iPhone repairs since 
the phone’s 2007 introduction. 
Apple may be the worst offender when 
it comes to refusing to sell service parts or provide repair infor-
mation to anyone but its authorized service providers. The 
company doesn’t even provide such information for equip-
ment that Apple won’t repair anymore (Apple has a long list 
of “vintage and obsolete” devices it no longer supports) or 
for repairs that its “Geniuses” aren’t skilled enough to do, 
like fixing a computer’s motherboard. 
In 2015, the company went even further—remotely disabling 
iPhones whose screens had been repaired outside of Apple’s 
authorized network. One of those dead devices belonged to 
Antonio Olmos, a photographer for The Guardian. He broke 
his screen while covering the refugee crisis in the Balkans. 
There’s no Apple store in Macedonia, so Olmos had a local 
repair shop replace the broken screen with an aftermarket 
part. It worked great. Months later, though, after a routine 
software update, Olmos’s phone stopped working simply 
because of that screen.
At first, Apple defended “error 53” (as the problem was 
identified) as a security measure. The company blamed 
unauthorized repair shops: “When an iPhone is serviced 
by an unauthorised repair provider, faulty screens or other 
invalid components that affect the touch ID sensor could 
cause the check to fail if the pairing cannot be validated. 
With a subsequent update or restore, additional security 
checks result in an ‘error 53’ being displayed,” an Apple 
spokesperson told The Guardian.
But that explanation didn’t fly with owners. Independent
repair shops didn’t break these phones; Apple did. And the 
aftermarket screens hadn’t been faulty; they just hadn’t been 
made by the original equipment manufacturer—because Apple 
refuses to sell OEM screens to independent repair shops.
Bowing to public pressure, Apple apologized and fixed the 
broken phones with a new update. But a precedent had been 
set. Previously, Apple had made it difficult for people to fix its 
products by restricting access to parts and service informa-
tion. Now, to those owners who dared to repair their equip-
ment without the company’s blessing, Apple could dole out 
punishment—with software. 
IN 2011, THE ENTREPRENEUR and venture capitalist 
Marc Andreessen quipped in an op-ed for The Wall Street Jour-
nal that “software was eating the world”—meaning that it’s 
now in pretty much everything: phones, microwave ovens, 
coffeemakers, sewing machines, even Barbies. And it’s threat-
ening to gobble up repair with it. 
NO SERVICEABLE 
PARTS:Or so 
manufacturers would 
have people believe 
when it comes to 
electronic devices 
such as smart watches 
and mobile phones. 
But repair is often 
possible, using 
replacement parts 
and instructions from 
other sources.

machine. There is no discussion. No negotiation. No signa-
ture requirement. Just turn the key and you waive your right 
to own critical parts of the machine you just bought. 
S
O HOW CAN PEOPLE in the United States pre-
serve their right to repair electronics? The answer 
is now apparent: through right-to-repair legislation 
enacted at the state level.
Popular support on this issue has been clear since 2012, 
when 86 percent of the voters in Massachusetts endorsed a 
ballot initiative that would “[require] motor vehicle manufac-
turers to allow vehicle owners and independent repair facilities 
in Massachusetts to have access to the same vehicle diagnos-
tic and repair information made available to the manufactur-
ers’ Massachusetts dealers and authorized repair facilities.”
Carmakers howled in protest, but after the law passed, they 
decided not to fight independent repair. Indeed, in January 
2014 they entered into a national memorandum of under-
standing, voluntarily extending the terms of the  Massachusetts 
law to the entire country. The commercial vehicle industry 
followed suit in October 2015.
Now we need right-to-repair legislation for other kinds of 
equipment, too, particularly electronic equipment, which is 
the focus of “digital right to repair” initiatives in many states.
Similar to the Massachusetts legislation for automobiles, 
these digital-right-to-repair proposals would require manu-
facturers to provide access to service documentation, tools, 
firmware, and diagnostic programs. They also would require 
manufacturers to sell replacement parts to consumers and 
independent repair facilities at reasonable prices.
The bills introduced this year in a dozen states have some 
variations. The ones in Kansas and Wyoming, for example, 
are limited to farm equipment. The one most likely to be 
adopted soon is in Massachusetts, which seeks to outlaw the 
monopoly on repair parts and information within the state. 
If it passes, electronics manufacturers will probably change 
their practices nationwide. 
Consumers would then have more choices when some-
thing breaks. The next time your smartphone screen cracks, 
your microwave oven gets busted, or your TV dies, you may 
be able to get it fixed quickly, affordably, and fairly. And you, 
not the manufacturer, would decide where your equipment 
is repaired: at home, with the manufacturer, or at a local 
repair shop that you trust.
The right to repair electronics isn’t just about repair or even 
about technology—it’s about ownership. You bought the thing, 
and therefore you own it—and not just part of it but all of it. 
And that means you should be able to fix it or get it fixed by 
whomever you choose. The terms of ownership shouldn’t 
change just because the product has a chip in it.  □

All computerized equipment comes with embedded 
software—code that tells the machine what to do and how 
its components should function together. Without that code, 
our coffee doesn’t brew, our cars don’t shift gears, and our 
sewing machines can’t stitch.
When you buy such a machine, the hardware becomes 
yours. But if you ask manufacturers, they’ll say that the soft-
ware inside still belongs to them. It’s copyrighted, and most 
manufacturers don’t want you to touch it, even if the thing 
is broken. And thanks to a controversial U.S. law called the 
Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), manufacturers are 
allowed to put digital locks on the code to stop people from 
meddling with (or even looking at) it. The European Union’s 
Copyright Directive has similar provisions. Originally, these 
sorts of laws were designed to prevent pirates from copying 
movies and music. But, increasingly, manufacturers use them 
to maintain control of the products they sell to you. 
Lexmark famously used the DMCA to sue Static Control 
Components, which was making chips that allowed other 
companies to refill Lexmark toner cartridges and sell them 
again. Recently, HP went so far as remotely disabling unli-
censed cartridges installed in its printers. Even John Deere 
deploys digital locks to make sure that only its own tech-
nicians can fix anything software-related on its agricul-
tural machines.
When asked why it was standing in the way of farmers who 
want to fix their own tractors, the company replied that farm-
ers didn’t really own their tractors. According to John Deere,
farmers have only “an implied license for the life of the vehi-
cle to operate the vehicle,” and farmers (or their mechanics) 
aren’t allowed to fiddle with the software to effect a repair.
Naturally, that position upset a lot of farmers, who assumed 
that when they plopped down $75,000 or more for a new trac-
tor, they were buying the whole thing. They felt they should 
be able to fix their tractors on their own terms. And it turns 
out that the farmers were right.
Authorities in the U.S. Copyright Office—who presumably 
have a deeper knowledge of U.S. copyright law than John 
Deere does—have generally sided with consumers when it 
comes to repair. In 2015, copyright officials told John Deere 
that owners do have the right to repair their own tractors 
and other equipment. And, in December 2016, the copyright 
office concluded a yearlong study on copyright law, repair, 
and embedded software that solidly confirms that repair is 
legal under copyright law. The same study argues that federal 
copyright law can’t be used as an excuse to prevent repair. 
But that hasn’t stopped some manufacturers from continu-
ing to try. For example, as part of John Deere’s 2016 End User 
Licensing Agreement, the buyer agrees to give up all control 
over the electronics within the machine—including sensors, 
actuators, and computing units, as well as data, documen-
tation, and diagnostics. What’s more, the buyer is assumed 
to have agreed to the contract simply by switching on the

and other information, hold the information they 
steal for ransom, and even bring systems down com-
pletely, as happened with the attack on Dyn. The 
result is an ongoing arms race between hackers and 
computer-security experts, forcing the rest of us to 
live on a treadmill of security updates to the soft-
ware we run on our various computers.
The current paradigm—a cat-and-mouse game 
of increasingly sophisticated hacks and software 
patches—presents a particularly thorny challenge 
for the Internet of Things. One reason is that secu-
rity attacks on the IoT can have catastrophic con-
sequences for our power grids, water supplies, 
and hospitals, to name just a few pieces of critical 
infrastructure that are vulnerable. The other rea-
son for worry is that mass-produced smart devices 
may simply not have hardware capable of being 
programmed to resist all the threats that will arise in their 
lifetimes. These realities cast into doubt whether we are 
indeed ready for the regime of pervasive, ubiquitous com-
puting devices. And yet it’s upon us.
Here we explore what might be a way out of this predica-
ment. In a nutshell, we propose that the various gizmos mak-
ing up the IoT should be built so that their very hardware can 
adapt to future security threats. That won’t be easy to engineer, 
but in our view, it’s the smart way to design smart devices.
WHY ARE IOT 
DEVICES SO
VULNERABLE
TO HACKING?
One obvious reason is just their numbers. With billions 
of devices around, there will always be a multitude—
many millions—that behave maliciously or are otherwise 
compromised. And each compromised device connected to 
the Internet may attempt to infect many others. So on the Inter-
net of Things, the barrage of attacks will be vast and relentless.
The personalization factor is another reason to expect 
that security vulnerabilities of these devices will have espe-
cially catastrophic results. We now have small digital sys-
tems that track and record many of our daily activities: 
our sleep, our contacts with one another, our health care 
measures, our browsing patterns, and so forth. The informa-
ON 21
OCTOBER 
OF LAST
YEAR,
a variety of major websites—including those of Twitter, 
PayPal, Spotify, Netflix, The New York Times, and The Wall 
Street Journal—stopped working. The cause was a distributed 
denial-of-service attack, not on these websites themselves 
but on the provider they and many others used to support 
the Domain Name System, or DNS, which translates the 
name of the site into its numerical address on the Internet. 
The DNS provider in this case was a company called Dyn, 
whose servers were barraged by so many fake requests for 
DNS lookups that they couldn’t answer the real ones.
Distributed denial-of-service attacks are common enough. 
But two things made this attack special. First, it hobbled a 
large DNS provider, so it disrupted many different websites. 
Also, the fake requests didn’t come from the usual botnet of 
compromised desktop and laptop computers. Rather, the 
attack was orchestrated through tens of millions of small, 
connected devices, things like Internet-connected cameras 
and home routers—components of what is often called the 
Internet of Things, or IoT for short. 
For several years now, the number of things connected to 
the Internet—including phones, smart watches, fitness track-
ers, home thermostats, and various sensors—has exceeded 
the human population. By 2020, there will be tens of billions 
of such gadgets online. The burgeoning size of the Internet 
of Things reflects the fastest economic growth ever expe-
rienced for any sector in the history of human civilization. 
For the most part, this development promises great excite-
ment and opportunity for engineers and society at large. 
But there is a dark cloud hanging over the IoT: the concomi-
tant threats to security and privacy, which will be of a scale 
never experienced before.
Our digital systems are vulnerable to malicious hackers 
attempting to gain unauthorized access, steal personal data

tion from these devices is typically communicated through 
the Internet to central repositories and servers for storage 
and analysis, and an adversary breaking into that commu-
nication at any point can access some of your most intimate 
personal information.
Still another concern with attacks on these devices pertains 
to their interaction with the physical world. A smart toaster at 
home or sensors in a factory, when hacked, can lead to disas-
trous consequences that affect the machines being controlled. 
Traditional mechanisms used to keep computers secure 
will probably not be adequate. For one thing, most of those 
protections—designed for laptops, desktops, servers, and 
even phones—consume significant amounts of power. They 
won’t work for a tiny device such as a watch or sensor node, 
which must operate using very little energy. 
What’s more, protection mechanisms are typically 
designed for computing systems that remain in opera-
tion for only a few years. People tend to replace their desk-
top and laptop computers every three to four years, and 
they upgrade their smartphones and tablets even more 
frequently. But a smart car, Internet-connected power 
meter, or smart traffic light may have a significantly lon-
ger life span, in some cases measured in decades. So you 
can’t just expect that the replacement will fix any secu-
rity problems the old one had. Nor can the manufacturers 
anticipate what sort of hardware resources their devices 
might need to thwart the kinds of attacks they will expe-
rience in the distant future. 
Indeed, it’s hard today to imagine how exactly these 
devices will be used, much less what the threats are going 
to be 10 or 20 years from now. Perhaps by that time your 
refrigerator will communicate with your autonomous car 
so that it can automatically fetch groceries when they’re 
needed—but a compromised smart lightbulb in your kitchen 
will also be able to eavesdrop on that communication and 
make mischief with the information. We simply don’t know 
enough to predict the uses of different smart gadgets in the 
future or the repercussions of their being compromised. 
So we need somehow to design these systems to protect us 
against attacks that we will only discover later.
How then can engineers possibly make the Internet of 
Things secure? In seeking solutions, we enter into highly uncer-
tain territory, with lots of unknowns and very few 
concrete answers. Consequently, while security 
experts need to do the best they can to develop 
protections to known threats, they should also 
design devices so that they can be configured 
and upgraded in response to unanticipated vul-
nerabilities and compromises. Our approach to 
achieve that is called hardware patching.
ANIOT DEVICEsuch as a smart 
lightbulb can easily be hacked 
and infected with malware, 
which could then spread to 
other devices on the network. 
Future, patchable hardware 
could reduce this threat.

at least in the realm of software. People today are painfully 
aware of the need for software updates to ensure the con-
tinued secure operation of their phones and computers. 
Most of us get a steady stream of notifications informing us 
that new software is ready to be installed—reminders that 
become increasingly persistent the more we ignore them 
until finally the thing that’s complaining refuses to operate, 
at which point we give up and agree to the update.
Often, some applications stop working afterward and need 
to be updated themselves, taking more time and sometimes 
causing significant disruptions, which is why most users agree 
to software updates only grudgingly. And yet, these security 
updates are necessary because a typical computing device 
is exposed to dozens of new vulnerabilities every month. 
Up until now, patching has been done only to software or 
“firmware,” which is how people often refer to the system 
code running on small devices. The underlying hardware is 
itself immutable. We submit that engineers must permit not 
just the software but also the hardware to be patchable on 
devices intended to become part of the Internet of Things. 
Why? Because it may not be possible to fix all security vul-
nerabilities simply by modifying the software. For example, 
the hardware might implement a cryptographic encryption 
algorithm that is secure now but could become outdated 
long before the end of the system’s lifetime. The only way 
to address that possibility is to have hardware that can be 
reconfigured after the device is manufactured.
Another reason to make the hardware patchable is that small 
connected devices frequently must operate using very little 
energy, and software implementations of a given functionality 
typically consume more power than do hardware 
implementations of the same thing. So engineers 
often can’t design a small, low-power device that 
does what it needs to do just by using software 
running on some generic hardware—the devices 
must use special-purpose hardware for the job. 
As a result, software patching will probably be 
insufficient to make the needed security upgrades.

Clearly, one requirement for a patchable hardware design 
appropriate for the IoT is that it must work under highly aggres-
sive energy constraints—some wireless sensors, for example, 
draw on average just a few microamperes. Our work provides a 
design that can operate well under such constraints. One way 
to achieve that is with something called a field-programmable 
gate array (FPGA), a general-purpose chip on which the logic 
can be configured after manufacture. Our contribution to this 
line of research is to develop an architecture, one built around 
an FPGA, that can satisfy different security requirements.
To understand how this would work, consider a chip to be 
used in a small device destined for long-term deployment 
on the IoT. It could be for a smart lightbulb, a refrigerator, 
or whatever. In our proposed architecture, a centralized 
hardware block, called the security-policy engine, manages 
a comprehensive set of security-critical events, including 
communication among other design blocks in the system 
and with the outside world. 
As an example, the security-policy engine may require 
that a secret cryptographic key used for communication 
should be accessible only to certain specific hardware blocks. 
To enforce this rule, the security-policy engine must man-
age the sharing of secret keys between blocks, forbidding 
exchanges that don’t satisfy the specified security require-
ments. What if one day you learn that one hardware block 
contains a security vulnerability and should no longer be 
allowed access to a cryptographic key? If the hardware is 
immutable, there may be nothing you can do.
Now imagine that this security-policy engine is built using 
an FPGA. Because an FPGA is upgradable, you can patch 
it. In particular, if you need to protect the device against a 
newly discovered threat, you patch the hardware to enforce 
a new set of security requirements while still using just a 
few microamperes.
In principle, this sounds simple enough. In practice, there 
are a lot of details that need to be worked out. That’s because 
even small digital devices typically contain many diverse 
blocks of hardware designed by different third-party sources. 
In the lingo of the trade, these are referred to as intellec-
tual properties, or IPs. A security-policy engine needs to 
track communication between the different IPs so that it 
can enforce security requirements and identify violations. 
What’s more, a security-policy engine needs to have access 
to the security-critical events going on inside each of those 
IP blocks so it can properly flag those and react. 
What’s needed for that is a special interface that allows 
each IP vendor to use a common mechanism for its block 
of hardware to communicate with a security-policy engine. 
That doesn’t exist now, and it may take a very long time for 
standards for such an interface to emerge. Fortunately, most 
IPs already have what’s called a debug interface, which is 
normally used to check whether the IP is working as it’s sup-
posed to after it’s fabricated in silicon on a chip. If we con-
nect the security-policy engine to this interface, that engine 
can track a large number of different events going on inside 
the block in question. And if a new security requirement 
involves monitoring or reacting to an event that is already 
considered critical for validation of the IP, which it most 
likely will be, a hardware patch can allow the security-policy 
engine to track the relevant events straightaway—no need 
to alter the IPs at all.
Of course, if a new security requirement involves events 
in an IP that are not accessible through its debug interface, 
you’re out of luck. Our hope is that this situation won’t arise 
very often and that over time IP vendors will only make their 
debug interfaces richer—at least until a standard security 
interface for IPs is developed.
In the long run, as security experts understand the needs 
better, they will develop even more flexible protection mecha-
nisms for these low-power devices. Like the software security 
patches so common now, hardware patching will become a 
routine occurrence on the Internet of Things. The challenge 
will be figuring out a way to have these systems upgrade them-
selves on a regular basis, in a painless manner, without all the 
fear and loathing that accompanies software upgrades today.
There are already efforts to provide automated software 
updates for a variety of small Internet-connected devices 
like phones, a process called over-the-air, or OTA, updating. 
Such mechanisms must of course ensure that only authen-
tic software upgrades get loaded, and they must be robust 
enough to handle the loss of power or communications 
during an upgrade without “bricking” the device. Similar 
considerations will apply when hardware-configuration 
updates are made automatically. And those requirements 
will be difficult to meet in small IoT devices, which don’t 
typically have the hardware or software necessary to sup-
port such complex tasks.
While there will certainly be challenges to keeping the 
Internet of Things secure without asking users or system 
managers to manually upgrade dozens if not hundreds of 
different devices, we are hopeful that progress will be made 
and that systems for automatic upgrading will proliferate 
along with the devices themselves. If that happens, and if 
the components making up the Internet of Things are suf-
ficiently flexible, we believe that reasonable levels of secu-
rity can be maintained, even as the number of such devices 
grows into the trillions. And that’s probably going to hap-
pen sooner than you think.  ■

redox-flow batteries, a specialized type whose time has finally 
come. The VRFB was invented decades ago but has emerged 
only recently as one of the leading contenders for large-scale 
energy storage. 
How large? VRFBs are being touted for grid-scale uses in which 
they would store up to hundreds of megawatt-hours of energy. 
In these applications, they may be charged by large baseload 
power plants, which generate electricity cheaply but are too 
sluggish to accommodate sharp increases in demand during 
peak hours. Or they may be charged by renewable sources like 
wind farms, whose generation doesn’t always align well with 
demand. Like most batteries, VRFBs can deliver power nearly 
instantaneously, so they can stand in for the traditional means 
of meeting peak demand: fossil-fueled “peaker” plants that, in 
comparison with batteries, are costly to maintain and operate 
and not as fast. 
Lithium-ion batteries, too, have been proposed for grid-scale 
uses. But here they are no match for VRFBs, which have longer 
lifetimes, can be scaled up more easily, and can operate day in, 
day out, with no significant performance loss for 20 years or more. 
Soon this technology will be the cornerstone of the largest 
battery installation in the world: a 200-MW, 800-megawatt-hour 
storage station being built in Dalian. The first 100 MW will be 
installed by the end of this year, with the remainder coming on 
line in 2018. The station will help balance supply and demand on 
the Liaoning province power grid, which serves about 40 mil-
lion people, filling the same function as a peaker power plant 
but without using scarce water. Furthermore, if the batteries 
are charged by the wind-generated power that’s abundant in 
northern China, no fossil fuels will be burned. Should demand 
spike or the supply dip suddenly, the battery station will be able 
to dispatch all or just part of its 200 MW within milliseconds.
The result will be a stable grid that can integrate more renew-
able energy. At times, wind generation in Liaoning province 
tops 7 GW, or about 15 percent of total generation. But much of 
that power isn’t used because other sources already meet grid 
demand. Earlier this year, the amount of wind power in Liao-
ning that was curtailed, or wasted, reached 15 percent; in the 
neighboring province of Jilin, it was 30 percent. The Dalian site 
will store that wasted energy for later use, adding up to a few 
hundred gigawatt-hours per month. 
The Dalian site is just one of several big VRFB installations 
being built in China, so its reign as the world’s biggest battery 
may be short. Meanwhile, other countries are adopting VRFBs. 
According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s global energy stor-
age database, since 2014, more than 30 VRFB projects in 11 coun-
tries have been deployed or begun construction; these range in 
power from a few tens of kilowatts up to Dalian’s 200 MW. While 
these projects reflect the surging interest in all forms of energy 
storage, what’s driving the renewed push toward VRFBs are 
important technological distinctions.

Inside, it’s brightly lit and filled with humming machin-
ery, a mammoth futuristic manufactory. Robot arms 
grab components from bins and place each part with 
precision, while conveyor belts move the assembled 
pieces smoothly down production lines. Finished 
products enter testing stations for quality checks 
before being packed for shipping. 
It has been called a gigafactory, and it does indeed 
produce vast quantities of advanced batteries. But 
this gigafactory is in China, not Nevada. It doesn’t 
make batteries for cars, and it’s not part of the Elon 
Musk empire. 
Opened in early 2017, in the northern Chinese port 
city of Dalian, this plant is owned by Rongke Power 
and is turning out battery systems for some of the 
world’s largest energy storage installations. It’s on 
target to produce 300 megawatts’ worth of batter-
ies by the end of this year, eventually ramping up to 
3 gigawatts per year. 
The scale of this “other” gigafactory may be impres-
sive, but the core technology it makes is even more 
compelling. The Dalian factory produces vanadium

THE POSITIVE and negative sides 
of a vanadium redox-ﬂow battery 
are separated by a membrane 
that selectively allows protons to 
go through. During charging, an 
applied voltage causes vanadium 
ions to each lose an electron on the 
positive side. The freed electrons 
ﬂow through the outside circuit to 
the negative side, where they are 
stored. During discharging, the 
stored electrons are released, 
ﬂowing back through the outside 
circuit to the positive side.

TODAY’S STATE-OF-THE-ART vanadium redox-
flow batteries started out as a modest research 
project at the Pacific Northwest National Labora-
tory (PNNL), a U.S. Department of Energy lab in 
Washington state. The PNNL team, which I led, 
came together in 2007, at a time when world oil 
prices were steadily climbing. The economies of China and India 
were experiencing double-digit growth, and environmentalists were 
concerned about the accelerating rate at which they (and other coun-
tries) were consuming fossil fuels. In the United States, awareness 
was starting to build about the potential of renewable but intermit-
tent energy sources like wind and solar. 
Against that backdrop, we decided to search for a better way to store 
renewable energy as a means of promoting its adoption while also 
improving grid reliability. Our group included the lab’s top experts on 
power, materials, and chemistry, as well as an intellectual-property 
lawyer, Peter Christiansen, who has a background in power engi-
neering. Peter helped focus our efforts on tech-
nologies that would have the greatest societal 
impact. In 2009, our group began receiving sig-
nificant support from the DOE’s Energy Storage 
Program, which boosted our annual R&D budget 
to US $10 million.
At the outset, it wasn’t at all obvious that flow bat-
teries were the way to go. Indeed, we started off by 
reviewing all of the various battery technologies, 
including lithium ion, sodium sulfur, advanced lead 
acid, redox flow, and a few other novel concepts.
Then as now, attention was being lavished 
mainly on high-power lithium-ion batteries. 
According to Greentech Media, over 90 percent 
of energy storage systems deployed in the United 
States in 2015 and 2016 were Li-ion batteries, and 
that’s likely to be true this year as well. The tech-

battery maker, NGK Insulators, recalled its products and temporar-
ily halted production. 
Redox-flow batteries (RFBs), by contrast, offer features not 
found in other batteries. In theory, they can be easily scaled up to 
megawatt-hours, sustain their performance over much longer life-
times, and be much safer, if built around nonflammable materials. 
In contrast to Li-ion and other solid-state batteries, which store elec-
tricity or charge in electrodes made from active solid materials, an 
RFB works more like a reversible fuel cell: To discharge, the battery 
takes the chemical energy stored in liquid electrolytes and converts 
it into electrical current, reversing the process to charge.
Each flow battery cell has a negative side and a positive side. Depend-
ing on whether the battery is charging or discharging, each side will 
either produce or take in electrons that are flowing through an out-
side circuit. The two sides are separated by a membrane that selec-
tively allows protons to pass through. During charging, a voltage 
applied across the positive and negative sides causes vanadium ions 
in the electrolyte—which is flowing through the battery’s stack of thin, 
platelike cells—to each lose an electron on the positive side. The freed 
electrons pass through the outside circuit to reach the negative side, 
storing electrical energy. During discharging, the accumulated elec-
trons on the negative side flow back through the outside circuit and 
are taken up on the positive side, releasing the stored electrical energy. 
The first redox-flow batteries were developed in the early 1970s 
by Lawrence Thaller and his group at NASA, as a possible energy 
source for deep-space missions. They used an iron solution on the 
positive side and a chromium solution on the negative side. But the 
use of different elements led to cross-contamination, as iron and 
chromium ions tended to diffuse across the membrane separating 
the two solutions. 
In the mid-1980s, Maria Skyllas-Kazacos and her group at the Uni-
versity of New South Wales, in Sydney, demonstrated an improved 
RFB that used the same element—vanadium—on both sides of the bat-
tery, so there was no risk of contamination. Vanadium is an abundant 
silvery-gray metal, cousin to niobium and tantalum, that is primarily 
nology has steadily advanced as a result of several 
decades of intense work on batteries for electric 
vehicles and also mobile devices, such as laptops, 
tablets, and smartphones. Tesla’s Powerwall, for 
example, is intended for residential and business 
energy storage, but it uses essentially the same 
Li-ion cells as those in the company’s electric cars. 
For the grid-scale applications we were target-
ing, however, lithium-ion has major shortcom-
ings. To make battery packs capable of storing 
megawatt-hours requires many thousands or even 
millions of Li-ion cells, each of which needs to be 
managed individually as well as collectively with 
the other cells. Even then, Li-ion batteries can 
supply power over only relatively short durations, 
typically 2 hours or less. 
To create a longer-duration battery, manufac-
turers would have to make the electrodes thicker 
and pack them with more active materials, which 
would raise the price. Or utilities could simply 
install more Li-ion battery packs, adding to the cost.
The performance of a Li-ion battery also degrades 
over time, giving the battery a typical lifetime of 
10 years or so. That may be fine for a family car but is 
less desirable for use on the power grid. And Li-ion 
batteries have known safety issues, most notably 
the occasional explosion or spontaneous fire.
We also looked at sodium-sulfur batteries. Once 
considered quite promising for utility-scale instal-
lations, this type of battery operates at around 
300 °C to liquefy the sulfur and sodium, which 
respectively form the positive and negative elec-
trodes. But these batteries, too, have flammabil-
ity issues. After a 2-MW system at a plant in Joso 
City, Japan, caught fire in 2011, for example, the

more, retain their capacity even when fully discharged and charged,

And there’s every reason to expect more utilities 
to opt for this energy storage technology. China 
looks set to lead the way. The country’s 13th Five-
Year Plan for Power-Sector Development, released 
last year, aims to revitalize the electrical infra-
structure to allow the integration of over 300 GW 
of wind and solar power by 2020. It cites energy 
storage as a key technology in realizing this ambi-
tious goal and specifically recommends the scaling 
up of vanadium redox-flow batteries. 
Meanwhile, in California, Hawaii, Massachu-
setts, New York, and other states, mandates and 
policies are colliding with simple economics to 
compel utilities to deploy energy storage at rates 
unimaginable even a decade ago. 
As electricity customers come to expect every 
step of the electrical power chain—from energy 
generation through transmission and distribu-
tion to the end user—to be clean, efficient, reliable, 
flexible, and affordable, the case for energy stor-
age grows ever stronger.  ■

mined in China, Russia, South Africa, and Brazil. But the early VRFBs 
couldn’t store much energy—just 12 to 15 watt-hours per liter of elec-
trolyte. To serve any useful function, the batteries would have to be 
huge: A 1-MW/4-MWh system would have occupied an area equal to 
one or two basketball courts. 
Another problem was that the vanadium oxide tended to precipi-
tate out from the electrolytes, resulting in a gradual loss in the bat-
tery’s capacity. And as if those problems weren’t enough, keeping 
the vanadium in solution meant that the batteries could operate only 
within a narrow temperature range, between about 10 to 40 °C. The 
addition of thermal-management equipment and other control elec-
tronics further cut the battery’s overall efficiency while increasing its 
size and complexity.
HESE SHORTCOMINGS NOTWITHSTANDING,
the PNNL team believed the technology had great 
potential. So we resolved to develop new electro-
lyte chemistry, membranes, and prototypes. With 
the VRFB’s inventor, Skyllas-Kazacos, serving as 
an advisor, we began by running simulations to 
investigate different electrolytes. We tested the most promising ones 
in the lab and optimized their chemistry. 
Finally, in 2011, we succeeded in developing a new vanadium-
based electrolyte that relied on reactions with a chloride solution. 
This seemingly simple change effectively doubled the energy density 
over that of existing VRFBs: Because more vanadium ions remained 
stable in solution, more of them were available during charging 
and discharging. 
The resulting battery had a footprint that was one-third to one-fifth 
as large as its predecessors and could function within a much wider 
ambient temperature range, from 0 to +50 °C, without additional ther-
mal management. Other modifications made the battery more reli-
able, simpler to manage, and more tolerant of electrolyte impurities. 
PNNL licensed the breakthrough electrolyte chemistry to three 
U.S. companies, including UniEnergy Technologies (UET), a com-
pany that I cofounded in 2012 to commercialize the new VRFBs. In 
the five years since then, UET, based in Mukiteo, Wash., has success-
fully scaled up the batteries and deployed several megawatt-level 
field demonstrations. Our battery systems fit compactly in shipping 
containers, making them easy to transport and deploy. 
We’ve also brought down the batteries’ cost: A few years ago, the 
cost of a 4-hour VRFB system was about $800 per kilowatt-hour. 
These days, it’s about half that, comparable to the cost of a station-
ary lithium-ion system. But that’s not an apples-to-apples compari-
son. As mentioned earlier, like that of other solid-state batteries, 
lithium-ion’s capacity degrades over time, and its life span is shorter. 
We’ve tested individual VRFBs through more than 14,000 cycles, 
fully charging and discharging each cycle, and they still perform 
at 100 percent capacity. This should translate into a life span of 
20 years or more. To date, our company has installed several mega-
watt-scale systems around the world, with an additional 200 MWh 
either awarded or in contract.

alking into the hall to 
deliver the speech was a 
“daunting experience,” the 
speaker later recalled, but 
“we had projectors and all sorts of tech-
nology to help us make the case.” The 
technology in question was PowerPoint, 
the presentation software produced by 
Microsoft. The speaker was Colin Powell, 
then the U.S. Secretary of State.
Powell’s 45 slides displayed snippets of 
text, and some were adorned with photos 
or maps. A few even had embedded video 
clips. During the 75-minute speech, the 
tech worked perfectly. Years later, Powell 
would recall, “When I was through, I felt 
pretty good about it.”
The aim of his speech, before the United 
Nations Security Council on 5 February 
2003, was to argue the Bush adminis-
tration’s final case for war with Iraq in 
a “powerful way.” In that, he succeeded. 
While the president had already decided 
to go to war, Powell’s speech—inseparable 
from what would become one of the most 
famous PowerPoint presentations of all 
time—did nothing to derail the plan. The 
following month, the United States, United 
Kingdom, Australia, and Poland launched 
their invasion.
Powell’s speech dramatized how 
PowerPoint had become, by 2003, a nearly 
inescapable tool of communication and 
persuasion in much of the world. Since 
then, its domination has only become 
more complete. The same tool used by U.S. 
State Department and CIA officials to pivot 
an international coalition toward war is

domination was not the result of first-
mover advantage. What’s more, some 
of its most familiar features—the central 
motif of a slide containing text and 
graphics; bulleted lists; the slideshow; 
the slide sorter; and even the animated 
transitions between slides—did not origi-
nate with PowerPoint. And yet it’s 
become the Kleenex or Scotch Tape of 
presentation software, as a “PowerPoint” 
has come to mean any presentation cre-
ated with software. 
With PowerPoint as well as its prede-
cessors, the motif of the slide was, of 
course, lifted directly from the world 
of photography. Some presentation pro-
grams actually generated 35-mm slides 
for display with a slide projector. In most 
cases, though, the early programs cre-
ated slides that were printed on paper for 
incorporation into reports, transferred 
to transparencies for use on overhead 
projectors, or saved as digital files to be 
displayed on computer monitors. 
The upshot was that personal 
computer users of the 1980s, espe-
cially business users, had many 
options, and the market for busi-
ness software was undergoing 
hypergrowth, with programs for 
generating spreadsheets, docu-
ments, databases, and business 
graphics each constituting a 
multimillion-dollar category. At 
the time, commentators saw the 
proliferation of business software 
as a new phase in office automa-
tion, in which computer use was 
spreading beyond the accounting 
department and the typing pool to 
the office elites. Both the imagined 
and actual users of the new busi-
ness software were white-collar 
workers, from midlevel manag-
ers to Mahogany Row executives. 
PowerPoint thus emerged dur-
ing a period in which personal 
computing was taking over the 
American office. A major accel-
erant was the IBM Personal 
Computer, which Big Blue unveiled 
in 1981. By then, bureaucratic 
America—corporate and govern-
ment alike—was well habituated to buying 
its computers from IBM. This new breed 
of machine, soon known simply as the 
PC, spread through offices like wildfire.
The groundwork for that invasion had 
been laid the previous decade, in the 
1970s technosocial vision of the “office 
of the future.” It started, like so much 
of what we now take for granted in our 
contemporary world of networked per-
sonal computing, at Xerox’s legendary 
Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). The 
site was established in 1970 to invent 
the computing systems that would 
equip the future’s white-collar office, 
an arena the company hoped to domi-
nate in the same way it did photocopy-
ing. Many of the bright young computer 
scientists and engineers recruited to 
work at PARC knew one another from 
the major computer science pro-
grams funded by the Department of 
Defense’s Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (ARPA) at MIT, Carnegie Mellon, 
also used by schoolchildren 
to give classroom reports on 
planets, penguins, and poets. 
Microsoft rightly boasts of 
1.2 billion copies of PowerPoint 
at large—one copy for every 
seven people on earth. In any 
given month, approximately 
200 million of these copies are 
used, and although nobody’s 
really counting, our cumula-
tive generation of PowerPoint 
slides surely reaches well into 
the billions. So profound is 
PowerPoint’s influence that 
prominent figures have decried 
the software’s effects on think-
ing itself. Edward Tufte, the 
guru of information visual-
ization, has famously railed 
against the “cognitive style” of 
PowerPoint, which he charac-
terizes as having a “foreshort-
ening of evidence and thought” 
and a “deeply hierarchical 
single-path structure.” 
PowerPoint is so ingrained 
in modern life that the notion 
of it having a history at all may 
seem odd. But it does have a very defi-
nite lifetime as a commercial product that 
came onto the scene 30 years ago, in 1987. 
Remarkably, the founders of the Silicon 
Valley firm that created PowerPoint did 
not set out to make presentation software, 
let alone build a tool that would transform 
group communication throughout the 
world. Rather, PowerPoint was a recovery 
from dashed hopes that pulled a strug-
gling startup back from the brink of fail-
ure—and succeeded beyond anything its 
creators could have imagined.
P
owerPoint was not the 
first software for creating 
presentations on personal 
computers. Starting in 
1982, roughly a half-dozen other pro-
grams came on the market before 
PowerPoint’s 1987 debut. Its eventual 
“Evasion and Deception”: In a 2003 
speech to the United Nations Security 
Council, then U.S. Secretary of State Colin 
Powell made the case for going to war 
with Iraq. The accompanying PowerPoint 
slides included satellite imagery [top] 
that Powell said showed secret work on 
chemical and biological weapons.

TOP: DENNIS AUSTIN; BOTTOM: TAYLOR POHLMAN
Stanford, UC Berkeley, the University 
of Utah, and SRI. 
In 1972, PARC researchers began 
to focus on a new personal computer 
they called the Alto. Led by Alan Kay, 
Butler Lampson, Bob Taylor, and Chuck 
Thacker, they were captivated by an 
extraordinary idea: that in the 
office of the future, every individual 
would have a dedicated computer 
like the Alto. Moreover, these com-
puters would be networked to one 
another and to other, larger com-
puters, both locally and far away. 
This networking would form a web 
of communication and computing 
resources well beyond the capacity 
of any single personal computer. In 
the pursuit of this vision, Ethernet 
emerged, as did the PARC Universal 
Packet protocol, or PUP, an important 
predecessor of the TCP/IP standard of 
today’s Internet. 
The Alto’s creators emphasized 
the machine’s graphics capabilities, 
dedicating much of the computer’s 
hardware and software to rendering 
high-resolution imagery onscreen, 
including typography, drawings, digi-
tal photographs, and animations. It was 
a huge step up from the mainstream 
computers of the day, which still used 
punch cards, paper printouts, teletypes, 
and “dumb” terminals. Alto users inter-
acted with it through a graphical 
interface to access, generate, and 
manipulate information. Even the 
text was treated as an image. The 
computer was controlled through 
a standard keyboard and the then-
novel mouse that had emerged from 
Doug Engelbart’s SRI laboratory.
This graphical turn in computing 
was perhaps most pronounced in 
one of the Alto’s programming lan-
guages, called Smalltalk. Developed 
by Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Gold-
berg, and other collaborators, Smalltalk 
wasn’t just a programming language; 
it was also a programming and user 
environment. It introduced the graph-
ical user interface, or GUI, to personal 
computing, including a metaphorical 
the Lisa project, he seized control of 
another effort aimed at creating a low-
cost computer and pushed it, too, toward 
the PARC idiom. That computer became 
the Macintosh.
What does all this have to do with 
PowerPoint? Apple lavished resources—
people and cash alike—to embrace 
the PARC paradigm with the Lisa 
and the Macintosh, but not every-
one at Apple was happy about that. 
In particular, those working to 
maintain the existing Apple II and 
III lines felt that their efforts were 
being shortchanged. By 1982, the 
product marketing manager for the 
Apple III, Taylor Pohlman, and the 
software marketing manager for the 
Apple II and III, Rob Campbell, had 
had enough. They quit and went 
into business together, founding the 
company that would create PowerPoint.
But PowerPoint was not at all in their 
original plan.
O
ne thing that united 
Pohlman and Campbell—
but alienated them at 
Apple—was that they were 
cut from a different cloth than the 
computer-science types working on the 
Lisa and the Macintosh. Though 
both Pohlman and Campbell were 
technically minded, they were also 
oriented toward marketing and sales. 
Before Apple, Pohlman had worked 
in marketing at Hewlett-Packard, 
and Campbell had run a small 
accounting software company. 
The pair left Apple late in 1982, 
and by early 1983, they had secured 
US $600,000 in venture capital to 
create a software company, which 
they called Forethought. Ironi-
cally, the startup’s aim was to bring 
the PARC idiom to the IBM PC and its 
clones—in essence, to outplay Apple 
at its own game. That year, the Apple 
Lisa appeared, priced at nearly $10,000 
(more than $25,000 in today’s dollars). 
were routinely discussing their findings 
with outsiders and publishing details 
of the Alto system in journals. PARC 
researchers were, after all, still part of 
the broader ARPA community of com-
puter scientists and engineers. Many 
visitors who saw the Alto system con-
sidered it transformative. 
One such visitor was Apple cofounder 
Steve Jobs. Following Xerox’s invest-
ment in Apple in 1979, PARC researchers 
gave Apple engineers and management 
detailed demonstrations of Smalltalk 
and other programs previously reserved 
desktop with overlapping windows, con-
textual and pop-up menus, file browsers, 
scroll bars, selection by mouse clicks, 
and even cut, copy, and paste. 
While such innovations were osten-
sibly proprietary, by the end of the 
1970s, Xerox managers and PARC staff 
for Xerox insiders. Jobs was so enthralled 
by what he saw that he decided to reori-
ent the Lisa, a business computer Apple 
was developing at the time, to fully 
embrace the PARC idiom. A few years 
later, when Jobs was transferred out of 
Rob Campbell
quit Apple 
to cofound 
Forethought, with 
the ambitious 
goal of creating a 
graphical-software 
environment for the 
IBM PC.
Taylor Pohlman 
cofounded 
Forethought with 
Rob Campbell. When 
their initial plan failed, 
they pivoted to other 
projects, including 
presentation software 
called Presenter.

Two years earlier, Xerox had 
brought its own personal com-
puter, the Xerox Star, to market, 
at an even higher price. Pohlman 
and Campbell’s idea was to bring 
a graphical-software environ-
ment like the Xerox Alto’s to the 
hugely popular but graphically 
challenged PC. 
Forethought’s founders 
intended to go beyond the Star 
and the Lisa by incorporating an 
important dimension of Alto’s 
Smalltalk: object-oriented pro-
gramming. In simple terms, tra-
ditional programming of the day 
treated data and the procedures 
for manipulating it separately. In 
object-oriented programming, 
data and procedures are com-
bined in “objects” that interact 
with each other by passing mes-
sages between them. Proponents 
held that the modularity of object-
oriented programming made for 
speedier development, flexibility, 
and dynamic change. For exam-
ple, skilled Smalltalk program-
mers could quickly alter the GUI 
while the program was running. 
Object-oriented programming 
has since become the prevailing 
paradigm for the most widely 
used programming languages.
Pohlman and Campbell 
envisioned an object-oriented 
soft ware platform called 
Foundation, which was cen-
tered around documents. Each 
Foundation document would 
act like an object in Smalltalk, which 
a business user would stitch together 
with other documents to create, say, 
a report containing a graph of recent 
sales, a statistical analysis of customer 
traits, drawings of proposed changes to 
a product, and a block of explanatory 
text. Each element would be live, mallea-
ble, and programmable. Spreadsheets, 
databases, drawings, word processing—
Foundation would handle it all. Users 
would select a document with a mouse 
click, and contextual menus would then 
offer choices appropriate for that type 
of document. Foundation would be, in 
essence, Smalltalk for the office worker. 
Forethought staffed up, bringing in 
software developers from Xerox PARC 
who were familiar with object-oriented 
programming and WYSIWYG applica-
tions, in which the text and graphics dis-
played on screen look very similar to the 
way they will appear in print. To create 
certain functions, the startup inked deals 
with outside suppliers; Forethought also 
purchased a powerful VAX computer 
Slides Rule: Many of the elements of 
today’s PowerPoint were present from 
version 1.0, including its graphical, 
WYSIWYG environment; various 
presentation modes, such as the slide 
sorter and the slideshow; and the ability 
to easily format and size text, combine 
the text with images, and draw simple 
lines and shapes.

from Digital Equipment Corp. for the 
software-development effort.
Within a year, the company ran into 
difficulties. For one, the developers grew 
deeply concerned about which personal 
computers, if any, would be powerful 
enough to run Foundation. The Apple Lisa 
had the horsepower, but it was already 
failing in the market, while the Macintosh 
was deemed too feeble. And the IBM PC 
was still far behind where Forethought 
had hoped and planned it would be. 
More worrying was Oracle’s announce-
ment that it would need another year 
to deliver on its contract for the data-
base code. This meant that the launch 
of Foundation would be intolerably 
delayed. Forethought was running per-
ilously low on funds, and it didn’t have 
the resources to develop a database on 
its own. The company was facing, liter-
ally, an existential crisis.
Rather than liquidate the firm, manage-
ment and investors decided to “restart” 
Forethought—a “pivot” in today’s Silicon 
Valley parlance. Work on Foundation 
was set aside, while the firm focused 
on software publishing—that is, manu-
facturing, marketing, and supporting 
computer programs written by others. 
Forethought’s publishing arm produced 
software for the Apple Macintosh under 
the brand Macware. And it was a success. 
Its biggest hit, oddly enough, was a data-
base program called FileMaker. 
W
ith brightening finances 
from sales of FileMaker, 
Forethought began to 
develop a new software 
product of its own. This new effort was 
the brainchild of Robert Gaskins, an 
accomplished computer scientist who’d 
been hired to lead Forethought’s prod-
uct development. Gaskins was a poly-
math who had simultaneously pursued 
Ph.D.s in English, linguistics, and com-
puter science at UC Berkeley before join-
ing industry. He in turn hired a bright 
young software developer named Dennis

Austin, who had previously devel-
oped compilers at Burroughs and 
contributed to a GUI operating sys-
tem at a laptop startup. 
Gaskins and Austin worked closely 
to conceptualize, design, and specify 
Forethought’s new product. Gaskins 
spotted an opportunity in presenta-
tion software and believed they could 
apply the PARC idiom to this applica-
tion. He envisioned the user creating 
slides of text and graphics in a graphi-
cal, WYSIWYG environment, then 
outputting them to 35-mm slides, 
overhead transparencies, or video 
displays and projectors, and also 
sharing them electronically through 
networks and electronic mail. The 
presentation would spring directly 
from the mind of the business user, 
without having to first transit through 
the corporate art department.
While Gaskins’s ultimate aim for 
this new product, called Presenter, 
was to get it onto IBM PCs and their 
clones, he and Austin soon realized 
that the Apple Macintosh was the 
more promising initial target. Designs 
for the first version of Presenter speci-
fied a program that would allow the 
user to print out slides on Apple’s 
newly released laser printer, the 
LaserWriter, and photocopy the print-
outs onto transparencies for use with 
an overhead projector. 
Austin quickly got to work pro-
gramming Presenter in Apple 
Pascal on a Lisa computer, eventu-
ally switching to a Macintosh. He was 
joined in the effort by Tom Rudkin, 
an experienced developer, and the 
pair hewed as closely as possible to 
the Macintosh’s user interface and 
modes of operation. Indeed, the 
source code for Presenter included 
Apple-provided code for handling 
text, which Apple used in its own 
word processor, MacWrite.

In April 1987, Forethought introduced 
its new presentation program to the mar-
ket very much as it had been conceived, 
but with a different name. Presenter was 
now PowerPoint 1.0—there are conflict-
ing accounts of the name change—and 
it was a proverbial overnight success 
with Macintosh users. In the first month, 
Forethought booked $1 million in sales of 
PowerPoint, at a net profit of $400,000, 
which was about what the company had 
spent developing it. And just over three 
months after PowerPoint’s introduction, 
Microsoft purchased Forethought out-
right for $14 million in cash. 
PowerPoint then became Microsoft’s 
presentation software, first just for the 
Macintosh and later also for Windows. 
The Forethought team became 
Microsoft’s Graphics Business Unit, 
which Gaskins led for five years, while 
Austin and Rudkin remained the princi-
pal developers of PowerPoint for about 
10 years. Wisely, Microsoft chose to keep 
the Graphics Business Unit in Silicon 
Valley rather than move it to Redmond, 
Wash. The unit became Microsoft’s first 
outpost in the region, and PowerPoint is 
still developed there to this day.
While PowerPoint was a success from 
the start, it nevertheless faced stiff com-
petition, and for several years, Lotus 
Freelance and Software Publishing’s 
Harvard Graphics commanded larger 
market shares. The tipping point for 
PowerPoint came in 1990, when Microsoft 
unleashed its bundling strategy and 
began selling Microsoft Office—which 
combined Microsoft Word, Excel, and 
PowerPoint—as a $1,000 set. Previously, 
each part had been sold separately for 
about $500 apiece. 
Because most users of personal com-
puters required both a word processor 
and a spreadsheet program, Microsoft’s 
price for Office proved compelling. 
PowerPoint’s competitors, on the other 
hand, resented the tactic as giving away 
PowerPoint for free. And for more than 
a quarter century, Microsoft’s competi-
tive logic proved unassailable. 
These days, the business software mar-
ket is shifting again, and Microsoft Office 
must now compete with similar bundles 
that are entirely free, from the likes of 
Google, LibreOffice, and others. Pro-
ductivity software resides more often 
than not in the cloud, rather than on 
the user’s device. Meanwhile, the domi-
nant mode of personal computing glob-
ally has firmly shifted from the desktop 
and laptop to the smartphone. As yet, no 
new vision of personal computing like 
the one that came from Xerox PARC in 
the 1970s has emerged. And so for the 
moment, it appears that PowerPoint, as 
we know it, is here to stay.  □

PAST FORWARD_BY DAVID C. BROCK
Do you recognize this teapot? Tea bofﬁns might recognize it as a Melitta product. Computer graphics 
people, though, know this as the “Utah teapot.” In the mid-1970s, Martin Newell created an impressive 
3D model of the teapot for his Ph.D. work at the University of Utah. Other researchers adopted the 
iconic teapot to develop new graphics hardware and software. It also made cameo appearances in Toy 
Story, Monsters, Inc., and “The Simpsons,” eventually earning it the moniker of “World’s Most Famous 
Teapot.”
