Preface
Measure theory was initiated at the beginning of the twentieth century and “mea­
sure” is an important notion in analyzing the subsets of Euclidian spaces. In 1989, 
E. Borel first established a measure theory on subsets of the real numbers known as 
Borel sets, and Lebesgue measure was introduced by H. Lebesgue in 1902 and the 
related integral based on measure theory is more comprehensive than the Riemann 
integral (see [51, 117]). In fact, the notion of measure and its significance widely 
generalize the classical definitions of “length” and “area” in Euclidian spaces. In 
1918, the concept of outer measures was introduced and studied by C. Caratheodory 
(see [160]). Since then, measure theory and the calculus theory based on it were 
developed rapidly in the field of pure and applied mathematics.
In 1988, a new analysis theory called time scale theory that can unify continuous 
and discrete analysis was proposed by S. Hilger (see [118]). Then it has been widely 
used to study various classes of dynamic equations and models in the real-world 
applications (see [61, 63, 107, 141, 202]). Time scale is an arbitrary closed subset of 
the real line, and the calculus on a time scale includes the classical Riemann integral 
and the discrete sum, and the different form of the calculus between the classical 
Riemann integral and the discrete sum such as q-calculus and its generalizations is 
a big advantage. Measure theory based on time scales is powerful and significant in 
studying functions on time scales or hybrid domains (see [86]). In 1999, Agarwal 
et al. investigated the basic calculus on time scales and some of its applications 
(see [4]), and Guseinov et al. analyzed Riemann delta and nabla integration on time 
scales (see [112-114]). To understand basic integral on time scales, Cabada et al. 
formally introduced the concept of A-measure on time scales (see [69]) and the 
relation of the Lebesgue A-integral and the usual Lebesgue integral is thoroughly 
investigated. Based on these fundamental work, Deniz et al. introduced the notion 
of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure on time scales in both A and V forms, and the 
relation between Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral and Lebesgue-Stieltjes A-integral was 
established (see [87]).
With the rapid development of time scale analysis, a new view of dynamic 
derivatives on time scales was introduced by Q. Sheng (see [164]), and a new 
analysis method which can then unify A and V-cases together on time scales. In 
vii

Preface
2006, Q. Sheng et al. proposed the concept of combined dynamic derivatives on 
time scales, and it was the first time that A and V-dynamic equations can transfer 
mutually, and some new dynamic behavior which are between A and V-cases and 
outside of difference and differential equations can also be investigated based on 
this theory (see [165]). This combined idea was used to analyze different dynamic 
equations and inequalities and was also applied to hybrid dynamic behavior that will 
not appear in the real line and discrete time scales [16, 17, 159, 166].
Now it is natural to ask a question see how to analyze the measure of a time scale 
in a combined form which not only can the A and V measurability transfer mutually 
but also can induce a new hybrid measure. In this book, a new measure theory called 
combined measure theory on time scales is established, and ♦ a -measurability is 
proposed and studied.
Since time scale theory is a new and exciting type of mathematics and is 
more comprehensive and versatile than the traditional theories of differential and 
difference equations as it can mathematically and precisely depict the continuous- 
discrete hybrid processes and hence is the optimal way forward for accurate 
mathematical modelling in applied sciences such as physics, chemical technology, 
population dynamics, biotechnology and economics and social sciences. The one 
of the most important of applications is to study of almost periodic and almost 
automorphic functions and dynamic equations on hybrid time scales. Almost 
periodic phenomena are common and important in the real world, and the concept 
of almost periodic functions was first studied by H. Bohr and later generalized by V. 
Stepanov, H. Weyl, and A.S. Besicovitch, among others (see [54, 56, 57, 168, 211]). 
In 1955-1962, S. Bochner observed in various contexts that a certain property 
enjoyed by the almost periodic functions on the group G can be applied in obtaining 
more concise and logical proofs of certain theorems in terms of these functions, 
and S. Bochner called his property “almost automorphy” since it first aroused 
in work on differential geometry (see [58-60]). Based on well-known almost 
periodic and almost automorphic functions proposed by Bohr and Bochner, many 
new generalized concepts were introduced and studied by several researchers on 
the real line. Unfortunately, these theories do not work on non-translational and 
irregular time scales since the classical concepts of almost periodic and almost 
automorphic functions purely depend on the translation of functions, the results 
of the current study of almost periodic and almost automorphic problems are 
restricted to periodic time scales under translations. Nevertheless, for example, 
qZ := {qn : q > 1, n e Z} is not periodic under translations. This time scale leads 
to q -difference dynamic equations and plays an important role in different fields 
of engineering and biological science (see [43, 65]). However, it was impossible 
to study almost periodic problems for q -difference dynamic equations in the past 
because qZ is so irregular (the graininess function д is unbounded) and there was 
no concept of almost periodic functions defined on it. The irregular distribution 
on the real line leads to many difficulties in studying functions on time scales, 
especially in investigating functions defined by the arbitrary shifts of arguments such 
as periodic functions, almost periodic functions and almost automorphic functions,

etc. The classes of functions defined by the shifts of arguments are referred to 
as Shift Functions. In fact, the time scale without shift invariance will change 
the classical concept of relatively dense set on the real line, the convergence of 
function sequences, the completeness of function spaces, an almost periodicity of 
the variable limit integrals, etc. Therefore, it is very significant to make clear these 
basic properties before studying dynamic equations with shift operators on irregular 
time scales. In this book, the theory of matched spaces of time scales is established 
under which the closedness of time scales under non-translational shifts will be 
guaranteed so that qZ and some other types of irregular time scales can be regarded 
as the periodic time scales under shifts. Furthermore, the periods set of this new type 
of periodic time scale may be completely separated from the time scale T. These 
fundamental results established in this book will smooth the path to investigate the 
periodic, almost periodic and almost automorphic problems in which the definition 
of the functions is determined by the irregular shift of time variables.
In this monograph, we establish a theory of combined measure and shift invari­
ance of time scales and present the applications to realistic dynamical mathematical 
models on irregular hybrid time scales. The monograph is organized as 9 chapters:
In Chap. 1, the basic knowledge of calculus on the time scales is introduced 
including Riemann integration, stochastic calculus, combined derivatives and shift 
operators, etc., to make the book self-contained. Based on this knowledge, the 
combined Liouville formula and a -matrix exponential solutions to diamond-a 
dynamic equations are obtained and fundamental results of the quaternion combined 
impulsive matrix dynamic equation on time scales are established. The content of 
this chapter is the necessary theoretical knowledge to be used in the later chapters.
In Chap. 2, the combined measure theory on time scales is established, some 
important notions such as ♦a -measurability, ♦a -measurable functions, Lebesgue- 
Stieltjes combined ♦a -measure and the related integrals are introduced and studied. 
Based on the theory of combined measurability on time scales, the Riemann 
measure calculus is highly unified and deeply discussed on irregular hybrid time 
scales.
In Chap. 3, the concept of matched spaces of time scales is introduced and their 
basic properties are established. Based on it, the fundamental theory of the shift 
invariance of time scales is addressed. The whole chapter is devoted to the theory 
of the matched spaces of time scales and the intrinsic connections of some basic 
concepts introduced in this chapter are presented. Moreover, singularity theory of 
time scales under the action of the shift operators is established.
Chapter 4 is mainly devoted to establish a theory of almost periodic functions 
through the theory of matched spaces of time scales. Some basic notions and 
properties of periodic functions under the complete-closed time scales in shifts are 
presented. Moreover, a theory of S-almost periodic functions under matched spaces 
is developed and a generalized notion of S-almost periodic functions called n0-order 
A-almost periodic functions is proposed and investigated.
In Chap. 5, based on the theory of matched space of time scales, we develop 
a theory of almost automorphic functions. A notion of weighted pseudo S-almost 
automorphic functions and a new generalized type of almost automorphic functions

Preface
called n0-order weighted pseudo 3-almost automorphic functions under matched 
spaces are introduced and studied. Some of their basic properties are established. 
Moreover, some fundamental results of the discontinuous S-almost automorphic 
functions are obtained through introducing the S-equipotentially almost automor­
phic sequence under the complete-closed time scales under shift operators (short 
for S-CCTS).
In Chap. 6, some basic notions of C0-semigroup and Stepanov-like almost 
automorphic functions in matched spaces of time scales are introduced and studied. 
The concept of C0-semigroup on a quantum time scale is proposed and some basic 
properties are established and the notion of the Stepanov-like almost automorphic 
functions is introduced on a quantum time scale and their fundamental properties 
are investigated. Moreover, the weak automorphy of such functions in the quantum 
case is discussed. Finally, the theory of shift-semigroup and Stepanov-like almost 
automorphic functions under the matched space of time scales is established.
In Chap. 7, based the theory of 3-almost periodic functions and n 0-order A - 
almost periodic functions developed in Chap. 4, some fundamental results of the 
S-almost periodic solutions and n0-order A-almost periodic solutions of a general 
dynamic equations are established under matched spaces of time scales. Particularly, 
the basic results of almost periodic problems of the q -dynamic equations on a 
quantum time scale are included as the special case. In addition, by using the 
developed theory of matched spaces of time scales, the basic theory of dynamic 
equations under matched space of time scales is established and some effective 
methods are provided to study the almost periodic solutions of dynamic equations 
on hybrid time scales.
In Chap. 8, based on the theory established in Chap. 5, two types of almost 
automorphic solutions of dynamic equations under the matched spaces are dis­
cussed systematically. The weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic solutions and 
the n0-order weighted pseudo A-almost automorphic solutions of the general 
inhomogeneous dynamic equations are studied. Moreover, the almost automorphy 
of the solutions to dynamic equations with shift operators is analyzed, and some 
basic results of the discontinuous cases are established.
In Chap. 9, we will introduce some new types of neutral impulsive stochastic 
dynamical models on irregular time scales. By using almost periodic results of 
stochastic dynamic equations with shift operators, the mean-square almost periodic 
solutions for a new type of neutral impulsive stochastic Lasota-Wazewska timescale 
model are investigated. Moreover, the mean square almost periodic stochastic 
process with shift operators is applied to study the almost periodic oscillations for 
delay impulsive stochastic Nicholson’s blowflies timescale model on hybrid time 
scales.
This is a monograph devoted to developing a theory of combined measure and 
shift invariance of time scales with the related applications to shift functions and 
dynamic equations. The study of shift closedness of time scales is significant to 
investigate the shift functions such as the periodic functions, the almost periodic 
functions, and the almost automorphic functions and their generalizations, which 
have many important applications in dynamic equations on arbitrary time scales.

Chapter 1
Riemann Integration, Stochastic
Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time
Scales
This chapter mainly introduces basic knowledge of calculus on time scales. 
In Sect. 1.1, concepts and fundamental properties of Riemann delta and nabla 
integration on time scales are introduced including some basic results of Riemann 
integral and fundamental theorems of calculus. In Sect. 1.2, stochastic calculus and 
some basic results of stochastic dynamic equations on time scales are provided. 
Section 1.3 is mainly devoted to introducing the concept of shift operators on time 
scales by which a new concept of periodicity is introduced; shift operator plays 
an important role in discussing shift invariance of time scales in later chapters. In 
Sect. 1.4, momentous hybrid derivatives called combined derivatives or diamond- 
a derivatives which can strictly include delta and nabla derivatives are introduced, 
and some basic properties of combined dynamic derivatives and integrations are 
established. In Sect. 1.5, the combined Liouville formula and a-matrix exponential 
solutions to diamond-a dynamic equations are obtained. In Sect. 1.6, fundamental 
results of the quaternion combined impulsive matrix dynamic equation on time 
scales are established. The content of this chapter is the necessary theoretical 
knowledge to be used in the later chapters.
1.1 Riemann Integration on Time Scales
A time scale T (which is a special case of a measure chain) is an arbitrary nonempty 
closed subset of the real numbers R. Thus, it is a complete metric space with the 
metric d(t, s) =|t - s |.
For t e T, we define the forward jump operator a : T ^ T by
a(t) = inf{s e T : s > t},

1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
while the backward jump operator p : T ^ T is defined by
p(t) = sup{^ e T : s<t}.
In this definition, we put in addition a(max T) = max T if there exists a finite 
max T, and p(min T) = min T if there exists a finite min T. Obviously, both a(t) 
and p(t) are in T when t e T since that T is a closed subset ofR.
If a(t) > t, we say that t is right-scattered, while if p(t) < t, we say that t is 
left-scattered. Also, if t < max T and a(t) = t, then t is called right-dense, and if 
t>min T and p(t) = t, then t is called left-dense.
We introduce the sets TK and TK which are derived from the time scale T as 
follows: If T has a left-scattered maximum t1, then TK = T - {t1}; otherwise TK = 
T. If T has a right-scattered minimum t2, then TK = T - {t2}; otherwise TK = T.
For a,b e T with a < b, we define the closed interval [a, b]T in T by [a, b]T = 
{t e T : a < b}. Open intervals, half-open intervals, etc. are defined accordingly.
If f : T ^ R is a function and t e TK, then the delta (or Hilger) derivative of f 
at the point t is defined to be the number fA (t) (provided it exists) with the property 
that for each e > 0 there is a neighborhood U (in T) of t such that
| f(a(t)) - f(s) - fA(t)[a(t) - s]| < e|a(t) - s| for alls e U.
If t e TK, then we define the nabla derivative of f at the point t to be the 
number fv(t) (provided it exists) with the property that for each e > 0 there is 
a neighborhood U (in T)oft such that
| f(p(t)) - f(s) - fV(t)[p(t) - s]| < e|p(t) - s| for alls e U.
Note that the delta and nabla derivatives are particular cases of the alpha 
derivative introduced by Ahlbrandt et al. in [28], namely, with a = a and 
a = p, respectively. In fact, some important discrete dynamic equations such 
as Hamiltonian systems, Riccati equation, etc. (see [2, 24-27]) can be unified 
by time scales effectively (see [29-31]). The special and common feature of the 
continuous and discrete dynamic systems could be generally built by this powerful 
mathematical tool (see Aulbach et al. [20-23], Agarwal et al. [2, 3, 5-8, 10­
13, 16, 17], Akhmet et al. [34, 35], Akin et al. [36-38], Atici et al. [44-47]).
If T = R, then f is delta differentiable (nabla differentiable) at t if f is 
differentiable in the ordinary sense at t. In this case we then have fA(t) = fv(t) = 
f'(t). If T = Z, then f is delta differentiable (nabla differentiable) at t and we have
fA(t) = f(t + 1) - f(t) = Af(t), fv(t) = f(t) - f(t - 1) = V f(t),
where A is the usual forward difference operator and V is the usual backward 
difference operator defined by the last equations above.
A partition of [a, b)T is any finite ordered subset P = {10, 11,..., tn} c [a, b]T, 
where a = t0 <t1 < ... < tn = b. The number n depends on the particular

partition, so we have n = n(P). Let a and p be the forward and backward jump 
operators in T, respectively, and f be a real-valued bounded function on [a, b)T.
Denote
M = sup{ f (t) : t e [a, b)t}, 
m = inf{f(t) : t e [a, b)t},
Mi = sup{f (t) : t e [ti-1, ti)t}, 
mi = inf{f (t) : t e [ti-1, ti)t}.
The upper Darboux A-sum U(f, P) and the lower Darboux A-sum L(f, P) of f 
with respect to P are defined by
U(f, P) = YM^i - ti—1), 
L(f, P) = Ymiitii — ti-1).
Then
m(b — a) < L(f,P) < U(f,P) < M(b — a). 
(1.1)
The upper Darboux A-integral U(f) of f from a to b is defined by
U(f) = inf{U(f,P): P is a partition of [a, b)T}
and the lower Darboux A-integral L(f) is
L(f) = sup{L(f, P) : P is a partition of [a, b)T}
In view of (1.1), U(f) and L(f) are finite real numbers. Obviously, L(f) < U(f).
1.1.1 Riemann Delta and Nabla Integration on Time Scales
In this subsection, we will introduce the concepts and properties of the Riemann 
delta and nabla integration on time scales (see [112-114]).
Definition 1.1 (see [112, 113]) We say that f is A-integrable (delta-integrable) 
from a to b (or on [ a, b) T) provided L(f) = U(f). In this case, we write fb f (t)At 
for this common value. We call this integral the Darboux A-integral.
If P and Q are two partitions of [a, b)T such that every point ofP belongs to Q, 
i.e., P c Q, then we say that Q is a refinement of, or is finer than, P. The following 
lemma can be proved by using the similar way as that in the case T = R.
Lemma 1.1 (see [112, 113]) Let f be a bounded function on [a, b)T. If P and Q 
are partitions of [a, b)T and Q is a refinement of P, then L(f, P) < L(f, Q) <

U(f, Q) < U(f, P), i.e., adding more points to a partition increases the lower sum 
and decreases the upper sum.
Lemma 1.2 (see [112, 113]) If f is a bounded function on [a, b)T, and if P and Q 
are any two partitions of [ a, b) T, then L(f, P) < U(f, Q), i.e., every lower sum is 
less than or equal to every upper sum.
Proof The set P U Q is also a partition of [a, b)T. By applying Lemma 1.1 and 
P c P U Q and Q c P U Q, it follows that L(f, P) < L(f, P U Q) < U(f, P U 
Q) < U(f, Q). This completes the proof. 
□
Obviously, Lemma 1.2 yields the following result:
Theorem 1.1 (see [112,113]) Iffis a bounded function on [ a, b) T, then L(f) < 
U(f).
In fact, we can easily have L(f, P) < L(f ) < U(f) < U(f, Q) for all 
partitions P and Q of [a, b)T. In particular, for all partitions P of [a, b)T, it follows 
that L(f, P) < L(f) < U(f) < U(f, P). Hence the following result is immediate:
Theorem 1.2 (see [112, 113]) If L(f, P) = U(f, P) for some partition P of 
[ a, b) T, then the function f is Д-integrable from atob and fb f(t)At = L(f, P) = 
U(f, P).
In the following theorem, a “Cauchy criterion” for integrability and its proof can 
be given similar to the case T = R.
Theorem 1.3 (see [112, 113]) A bounded function f on [ a, b) T is Д-integrable if 
and only if for each e > 0 there exists a partition P of [ a, b) T such that U(f, P) - 
L(f, P) < e.
Lemma 1.3 (see [112, 113]) For every 8 > 0 there exists at least one partition 
P : a = 10 < 11 < • • • < tn = b of [ a, b) T such that for each i e {1, 2,..., n} 
either ti - ti-1 < 8 or ti - ti-1 > 8 and p(ti) = ti-1, where p denotes the backward 
jump operator in T.
Definition 1.2 (see [112, 113]) For given 8>0, the set of all partitions P : a = 
10 < 11 < • • • < tn = b is denoted by G8([a, b)T) or simply by G8 which possess 
the property indicated in Lemma 1.3.
The following criterion for integrability can easily follow from the case T = R.
Theorem 1.4 (see [112,113]) A bounded function f on [ a, b) T is Д-integrable if 
and only iffor each e>0 there exists 8>0 such that
P e G8 implies U(f, P) - L(f, P) < e 
(1.2)
for all partitions P of [a, b)T.
The Riemann definition of integrability is given as follows:

1.1 Riemann Integration on Time Scales

Definition 1.3 (see [112, 113]) Let f be a bounded function on [a, b)T, and let 
P : a = 10 < t1 < • • • < tn = b be a partition of [a, b)T. In each interval [ti-1, ti)T, 
where 1 < i < n, choose an arbitrary point ^i and form the sum
n
5 = E f(ti)(ti - ti-1).
i=1
(1.3)
S is called a Riemann A-sum of f corresponding to the partition P. f is said to be 
Riemann A-integrable from a to b (or on [a, b)T) if there exists a number I with 
the property that for each e > 0 there exists 8 > 0 such that | S - 11 < e for every 
Riemann A-sum S of f corresponding to a partition P e G8 independent of the 
way in which we choose %i e [ ti-1, ti) T, i = 1, 2,. ..,n .It is easily seen that such 
a number I is unique. The number I is the Riemann A-integral of f from a to b.
Theorem 1.5 (see [112, 113]) A bounded function f on [a, b)T is Riemann A- 
integrable if and only if it is (Darboux) A-integrable, in which case the values of the 
integrals are equal.
Proof Assume that f is (Darboux) A-integrable from a to b in the sense of 
Definition 1.1.Lete>0 and 8>0 be chosen such that (1.2) of Theorem 1.4 
holds. We claim that
f f(t)At < e 
a
(1.4)
for every Riemann A-sum (1.3) associated with a partition P e G8. In fact, we have 
L(f, P) < S < U(f, P) and so (1.4) follows from the inequalities
U(f, P) < L(f, P) + e < L(f) + e = jb f(t)At + e,
L(f, P) > U(f, P) - e > U(f) - e = j f(t)At - e.
i.e., (1.4) holds; hence f is Riemann A-integrable and I = fb f (t)At.
Now assume that f is Riemann A-integrable in the sense of Definition 1.3, and 
consider e>0. Let 8>0 and let I be as given in Definition 1.3. Select any 
partition P : a = 10 < t1 < • •• < tn = b of [a,b) such that P e G8, and 
for each i = 1, 2,... ,n, choose ^i in [ti-1, ti) such that f(^i) < mi + e, where 
mi = inf{ f (t) : t e [ti-1, ti)}. The Riemann A-sum S for this choice of ^i satisfies 
S < L(f, P) + e(b - a) as well as | S - 11 < e .It follows that L(f) L(f, P) > 
S - e(b - a) > I - e - e(b - a). Since e is arbitrary, we conclude that L(f) I .A 
similar argument shows that U(f) < I. Since L(f) < U(f), it follows that L(f) = 
U(f) = I. This shows that f is (Darboux) A -integrable and that /bt f (t)At = I. 
The proof is completed.

In the definition of fb f (t)At, we assumed that a < b. The following definitions 
remove this restriction:
f f(t)At = 0, 
[ f(t)At = -[ f(t)At, abb. (1.5)

Theorem 1.6 (see [112, 113]) Assume that a and b are arbitrary points in T. Every 
constant function f(t) = c(t e T) is A-integrable from a to b and
b cAt = c(b - a). 
(1.6)
J a
Proof Let a < b. Consider a partition P : a = 10 < 11 < • • • < tn = b of [a, b)t. 
Obviously we have U(f, P) = L(f, P) = c(b - a) and therefore Theorem 1.2 
shows that f is A-integrable and (1.6) holds. Formula (1.6) for a = b and a> b 
follows by the definition (1.5). Note that every Riemann A-sum of f associated with 
P is also equal to c(b — a). The proof is completed. 
□
Theorem 1.7 (see [112, 113]) Let t be an arbitrary point in T. Every function f 
defined on T is A-integrable from t to a(f) and
a(t)
f f(s)As = [ a(t) — t ] f(t). 
(1.7)
Proof If a(f) = t, then (1.7) is obvious, because both sides of (1.7) are equal to zero 
in this case. Let now a(f) > t. Then a single partition of [t, a(t))T is P : t = s0 < 
s 1 = a(f), and since [s0, s 1)t = [t, a(t))t = {t}, we have U(f, P) = f(t)[a(f) — 
t] = L(f, P). Therefore, it follows from Theorem 1.2 that f is A-integrable from 
t to a(f) and (1.7) holds. Note that the Riemann A-sum of f associated with P is 
also equal to f (t)[a(f) — t]. This completes proof. 
□
Theorem 1.8 (see [112, 113]) Assume a, b e T and a<b. Then we have the 
following:
(i) If T = R, then a bounded function f on [a, b)T is A-integrable from a to b 
if and only if f is Riemann-integrable on [a, b)T in the classical sense; in this 
case
b f(t)At = 
b f(t)dt,
aa
where the integral on the right is the usual Riemann integral.

(ii) If T = Z, then every function f defined on Z is Д-integrable from a to b and
[b f(t)At = 
f(k).
a 
k=a
(f.8)
Proof Clearly, the above given Definitions 1.1 and 1.3 of the Д-integral coincide 
in case T = R with the usual Darboux and Riemann definitions of the integral, 
respectively. Notice that the classical definitions of Darboux’s and Riemann’s 
integrals do not depend on whether the subintervals of the partition are taken closed, 
half-closed, or open. Moreover, if T = R, then GS([a, b)T) consists of all partitions 
of [a, b)t the norm (mesh) of which is less than or equal to S. So part (i) of the 
theorem is valid.
To prove part (ii), let a<b. Then b = a + p for some positive integer p. 
Consider the partition P * of [ a, b) Z defined by P * : a = 10 < t 1 < ... < tp = b, 
where 10 = a, t1 = a + 1,.. .,tp = a + p. P* contains all points of [a, b]Z and 
[ti-i, ti)Z = {ti—1} for each i <= {1, 2,..., p}. Then
pp
U(f, P*) = = Mi(ti - ti-1 = = f(ti-1), 
pp
L(f,P*)= = mi(ti - ti-1) = = f(ti-1).
So U(f, P*) = L(f, P*) = pi = £ f(ti-1) = £ f(k), and it follows from 
i=1 
k=a
Theorem 1.2 that f is Д-integrable from a to b and (1.8) holds. This completes the 
proof. 
□
The concept of V-integral (nabla integral) on time scales can be described briefly 
as follows:
Definition 1.4 (see [112, 113]) Let P : a = t0 <t1 <...<tn = b be a partition 
of (a, b]T and f be a real-valued bounded function on (a, b]T. Now let
M' = sup{ f (t) : t e (a, b]t}, m' = inf{ f (t) : t e (a, b]t},
Mi = sup{ f (t) : t e (ti-1, ti]t}, mi = inf{ f (t) : t e (ti—1, ti]t}.
We call the sums
U'(f, P) = YMM((ti — ti-1) and L'(f, P) = ^mi(ti - ti—1) 

8

respectively as the upper and lower Darboux V-sums of f.
It follows that
m'(b - a) < L'(f, P) < U'(f, P) < M'(b - a).
Definition 1.5 (see [112, 113]) The numbers
U'(f) = inf{U'(f, P) : P is a partition of (a, b]T}
and
L'(f) = sup{L'(f, P) : P is a partition of (a, b]T}
are called the upper and lower Darboux V-integrals off from a to b, respectively.
U'(f) and L'(f) are finite and the inequality L'(f) < U'(f) holds.
Definition 1.6 (see [112, 113]) f is said to be V -integrable (nabla integrable) from 
a to b (or on (a, b]T) if L'(f) = U'(f). In this case we write fb f(t)Vt for this 
common value. We call this integral the Darboux V-integral.
Definition 1.7 (see [112, 113]) A Riemann V -sum of f associated with the parti­
tion P is a sum of the form
n
*' = E f(^i)(ti - ti-1), 
i=1
where & e (ti-1, ti]T for i = 1, 2,. ..,n. The function f is Riemann V-integrable 
from a to b (or on (a, b]t) if there exists a number I' with the following property: 
For each e > 0 there exists 3 > 0 such that | S' - I' | <efor every Riemann V -sum 
S' of f associated with a partition P e G3, independent of the way in which we 
choose the points %i e (ti-1, ti]t, i = 1, 2,... ,n, where G3 denotes as above the 
set of all partitions P of (a, b]T possessing the property indicated in Lemma 1.3 
(note that the inequality ti -1 < ti with p(ti) = ti -1 is equivalent to ti -1 < ti with 
a(ti-1) = ti). The number I' is the Riemann V-integral of f from a to b.
Remark 1.1 A bounded function f on (a, b]t is Riemann A-integrable if and only 
ifit is (Darboux) V-integrable, in this case the values of the integrals equal.
For the special case T = R, the Riemann V-integral, as in the case of the V- 
integral, coincides with the usual Riemann integral. For the case T = Z, it follows 
bb
that a f (t)Vt = f (k), a<b. Comparing this with (1.8) shows that the 
k=a+1
delta and nabla integrals are in general different.

1.1 Riemann Integration on Time Scales

Remark 1.2 In the concept of the A-integral, the subintervals of a partition P : a = 
t0 <t1 < ... < tn = b were adopted as the intervals [ti-1, ti)T, i = 1, 2,...,n. 
In [110, 111], in the definition of the A-integral, the intervals [ti-1, p(ti)]T, i = 
1, 2,...,n, were adopted instead of the intervals [ti-1, ti)T, i = 1, 2,...,n. It can 
be shown that these two representations of the intervals are equivalent (see [113]).
1.1.2 Some Fundamental Results of the Riemann Integral
In this section, some properties of the Riemann delta integral are presented which 
also hold for the Riemann nabla integral.
Theorem 1.9 (see [112, 113]) Let f be A-integrable on [a, b)T and let M and m 
be its supremum and infimum on [a, b)T, respectively. Let, further, y : R ^ R 
be a function defined on [m, M] such that there exists a positive constant B with 
|y(x') — y(y) | < B |x — y| for all x and y in [m, M] (this condition is called as the 
Lipschitz condition). Then the composite function h(t) = <p(f(t)) is A-integrable 
on [a, b)T.
Proof For an arbitrary e > 0. By Theorem 1.3, there exists a partition P : a = tо < 
t1 < ... <tn = b of [a, b)T such that U(f, P) — L(f, P) < e/B. Let Mi and mi 
be the supremum and infimum of f on [ti — 1, ti)T, respectively, and let M* and m* 
be the corresponding numbers for h. By the condition on <p, we have, for all s and т 
in [ti—1, ti)T,
h(s) — h(T) <|h(s) — h(T)| = |<p(f (s)) — p(f(T))|
<B | f(s) — f(T)| < B(Mi — mi).
Hence M* — m* < B(Mi — mi) because there exist two sequences (sk) and (тк) 
of points in [ ti—1 ,ti) T such that h(sk) ^ M* and h(rk) ^ m* as к ^ те. 
Consequently,
U(h, P) — L(h, P) = £M — m*)(ti — ti—1) < B ^M — mi)(ti — tt — 1) 
i=1 
i=1
= B[U(f, P) — L(f,P)] <Be = e 
B
and h is A-integrable on [a, b]T by Theorem 1.3. This completes the proof. □
The following theorem is more general than Theorem 1.9 and can be shown 
similar to the case T = R; we will not repeat the proofs here.
Theorem 1.10 (see [112, 113]) Let f be A-integrable on [a, b)T and let M and 
m be its supremum and infimum on [a, b)T, respectively. Let, further, ^ : R ^ R 

10

be a continuous function on [m, M]. Then the composite function h = y ◦ f is 
Л-integrable on [a, b)T.
Corollary 1.1 (see [112,113]) If f is Л-integrable on [ a, b) T, then for an arbitrary 
positive number a, the function | f |a is Л-integrable on [ a, b) T.
Proof In fact, it is sufficient to consider the continuous function y(x') = |x |a and 
apply Theorem 1.10. 
□
Theorem 1.11 (see [112, 113]) Let f be a bounded function that is Л-integrable 
on [a, b)T. Then f is Л-integrable on every subinterval [c, d)T of [a, b)T.
Proof Let e > 0 and P be a partition of [a, b)T such that U(f, P) - L(f, P) < e. 
Adding to P the points c and d, we get a new partition P' of [a, b)T. Then by 
Lemma 1.1 we also have U(h, P') - L(h, P') < e. Now consider the partition 
P" of [c, d)T consisting of all points of P' belonging to [c, d]T. For upper and 
lower Л-sums U and L of f on [c, d)T associated with this partition P", we have 
U — L < U(f, P') - L(f, P'). So, U — L < e and by Theorem 1.3 the function f 
is Л-integrable on [c, d)T. 
□
The proof of the following theorem is similar to the case T = R.
Theorem 1.12 (see [112, 113]) Let f and g be Л-integrable functions on [a, b)T 
and c be a real number. Then
(i) cf is Л-integrable and fb cf(t)At = c fb f(f)^t;
(ii) f + g is Л-integrable and fb[f (t) + g(t)]Лг = fb f(t)^t + /b g(t)^t.
Theorem 1.13 (see [112, 113]) Let f and g be Л-integrable functions on [a, b)T. 
Then their product fg is Л-integrable on [a, b)T.
Proof We claim that if f is Л-integrable on [a, b)T, then f2 is Л-integrable on 
[a, b)T. In fact, f2(t) = <p(f(t)) with <p(x) = x2, and <p satisfies the Lipschitz 
condition on any finite interval [m, M]. Therefore f2 is integrable by Theorem 1.9. 
Now the desired result follows from the identity 4fg = (f + g)2 - (f - g)2 by 
Theorem 1.12. This completes the proof. 
□
Following the proof of the case T = R, the following theorem is immediate:
Theorem 1.14 (see [112,113]) Let f be a function defined on [ a, b) T and let c e T 
with a < c < b. If f is Л-integrable from a to c and from c to b, then f is Л- 
integrable from a to b and
[Ь f(t)At = Г f(t)At + fb f(t)At.

Theorem 1.15 (see [112, 113]) If f and g are Л-integrable on [a, b)T and if 
f(t) < g(t) for all t e [a, b)T, then fb /<(№ < /b gif^t.

1.1 Riemann Integration on Time Scales
11
Proof By Theorem 1.12, h = g — f is A -integrable on [ a, b) t. Since h(t) 0 
for all t e [a, b)t, it is clear that L(h, P) 0 for all partitions P of [a, b)T and 
so /b h(t)At = L(h) 0. Applying Theorem 1.12 again, we see that fb g(t)At — 
fb f (t)At = fb h(t)At 0. The proof is completed. 
□
Theorem 1.16 (see [112, 113]) If f is A-integrable on [a, b)T, then |f| is A- 
integrable on [a, b)T and
b f(t)At

|f(t)|At.
(1.9)
Proof The result easily follows from Theorem 1.15 provided we know |f | is 
A-integrable on [a, b)t. In fact, —| f | < f < | f | and so — /b | f(t)|At < 
fb f(t)At < fb | f(t) | At, which implies (1.9). We now prove that | f | is A - 
integrable. Consider the function <p(x) = |x|. This function satisfies a Lipschitz 
condition on any interval. Further, we have | f (t) | = <p(f (t)). Therefore, | f | is A - 
integrable by Theorem 1.9. This completes the proof. 
□
Corollary 1.2 (see [112, 113]) Let f and g be A-integrable on [a, b)T. Then

For the case T = R, the following theorem is immediate:
Theorem 1.17 Let (fk) be a sequence of A-integrable functions on [a, b)T, and 
suppose that fk ^ f uniformly on [a, b)T for a function f defined on [a, b)T. 
Then f is A-integrable from a to b and fb f (t)At = lim /b fk(t)At.
The statement for the series of functions of Theorem 1.17 can be stated as 
follows:

Theorem 1.18 (see [112, 113]) Suppose that

1.1.3 Fundamental Theorems of Calculus
In this subsection, we will present two versions of the fundamental theorem of 
calculus. Before this, some basic definitions concerning the time scales and some 
mean value theorems for derivatives on time scales will be presented.

12
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
Theorem 1.19 (see [112, 113]) Let f be a continuous function on [a, b]T that is 
Д-differentiable on [a, b)T (the differentiability at a is understood as right-sided) 
and satisfies f(a) = f(b). Then there exist %,т e [a, b)T such that /Д(т) < 0 < 
f^%).
Proof Since the function f is continuous on the compact set [a, b]T, f assumes 
its minimum m and its maximum M. Therefore there exist %, т e [a, b]T such that 
m = f(%) and M = f(r). Since f (a) = f(b), we may assume that %, т e [a, b)T. 
Hence f Д(т) < 0 and f Д(%) 
0. This completes proof. 
□
Theorem 1.20 (see [112, 113], Mean Value Theorem) Let f be a continuous 
function on [a, b]T which is Д-differentiable on [a, b)T. Then there exist %,т e 
[a, b)T such that
f*(T) < bbf , f*(%). 
b -a
Proof By applying Theorem 1.19 to the function
f(b)-f(a)
V(t) = f(t) - f(a) — 
, (t - a),
b -a
we can obtain the desired result immediately. 
□
Corollary 1.3 (see [112, 113]) Letfbe a continuous function on [a, b]T that is Д- 
differentiable on [a,b)T. If /Д(Г~) = 0 for all t e [a,b)T, then f is a constant 
function on [a, b]T.
Corollary 1.4 (see [112, 113]) Let f be a continuous function on [a, b]T that is 
Д-differentiable on [a, b)T. Then f is increasing, decreasing, nondecreasing, and 
nonincreasing on [a, b]T if /Д(1~) > 0, /Д(1') < 0, /Д(^) 0, and /Д(1') < 0 for
all t e[a, b)T, respectively.
In the similar way, the analogue of V-derivative of Theorem 1.20 can be obtained.
Theorem 1.21 (see [112,113]) Let f be a continuous function on [ a, b ]T that is V 
differentiable on (a, b]T. Then there exist %, т e (a, b]T such that
f V (T) < f(bf f V (%).
b-a
For Д -predifferentiable functions, there is a generalization of Theorem 1.20 as 
follows:
Definition 1.8 (see [112,113]) A function f : T ^ R is called Д -predifferentiable 
(with region of Д-differentiation D), provided that the following conditions hold:

1.1 Riemann Integration on Time Scales
13
(i) f is continuous on T;
(ii) D c Tk, Tk - D is countable and contains no right-scattered elements of T;
(iii) f is A-differentiable at each t e D.
Theorem 1.22 (see [112, 113]) Let f and g be real-valued functions defined on T. 
Suppose both f and g are A-predifferentiable with region of A-differentiation D. 
Then | fA(t)| < gA(t'y for all t e D implies | f(r) - f(s)| < g(r) - g(s) for all 
r, s e T, r s.
In Theorem 1.22 by letting f = 0, we have the following:
Corollary 1.5 (see [112, 113]) Let g : T ^ R be a A-predifferentiable function 
with region of A-differentiation D. If gA(t) 
0 for all t e D, then g is
nondecreasing on T.
Theorem 1.23 (see [112, 113]) Let f be a continuous function on [a, b]T c T 
that is A-predifferentiable on [a, b)T with region of A-differentiation D c[a, b)T. 
Suppose f (a) = f(b). Then there exist f,T e D such that fA(r) < 0 < f A(f).
Proof If f is a constant function, then fA (t) = 0 for all t e[a, b)T and, therefore, 
the theorem holds in this case. Now suppose that f is not constant. To prove that 
there exists т e D such that f a(t) < 0, we suppose the contrary: let fA(f) > 0 for 
all t e D. Applying Corollary 1.5 to the function f : [a, b]T ^ R, we get that f 
is nondecreasing on [a, b]T . But this gives a contradiction, since f(a) = f(b) and 
f is nonconstant. Therefore the desired point т e D exists. Similarly, considering 
the function - f, we can prove that there exists f e D such that f A(f) 
0. This
completes the proof. 
□
Based on Theorem 1.23, similar to the proof of Theorem 1.20, the following 
generalization is immediate:
Theorem 1.24 (see [112, 113]) Let f be a continuous function on [a, b]T c T that 
is A-predifferentiable on [a, b)T with region of A-differentiation D c[a, b)T. Then 
there exist f, т e D such that (b - a)fA(r) < f (b) - f(a) < (b - a)fA(f).
Let [a, b]t be a closed bounded interval in T. A function F : [a, b]T ^ R is 
called a A-antiderivative of f : [a, b)T ^ R provided F is continuous on [a, b]t 
and A-differentiable on [a, b)T, and FA(t) = f(t) for all t e[a, b)T.
Theorem 1.25 (see [112, 113]) (Fundamental theorem of calculus I). Let f be A- 
integrable function on [ a, b) T. If f has a A-antiderivative F : [ a, b ]t ^ R, then
I f(t)At = F(b) - F(a). 
(1.10)
a
Proof Let s > 0. By Theorem 1.3, there exists a partition P : a = 10 <t1 < ... < 
tn = b of [a, b)T such that

U(f,P) - L(f,P)<s. 
(1.11)
Applying Theorem 1.20 to F : [ti-1, ti]T ^ R for each i = 1, 2,... ,n, we obtain 
ti, Ti e [ti-1, ti)t such that (ti - ti—1 )f(Ti) < F(ti) - F(t — 1) < (ti - ti—1 )f&).
Hence summing we have £ (ti - ti-1 )f(Ti) < F(b) - F(a) < £ (ti - ti-1 )f(ti). 
i=1 
i=1
So the estimate
L(f, P) < F(b) - F(a) < U(f, P) 
(1.12)
follows. Since we have L(f, P) < fb f(t)At < U(f, P) for all partitions P of 
[a, b)t, inequalities (1.11) and (1.12) imply that | /b f (t)At - [F(b) - F(a)]| < s. 
Since s is arbitrary, (1.10) holds. This completes the proof. 
□
Theorem 1.26 ([112, 113], Integration by Parts) Let p and v be continuous 
functions on [a, b]T that are A-differentiable on [a, b)T. If uA and vA are integrable 
from a to b, then
f uA(t)vA(t)At + f u(a (t))vA (t)At = u(b)v(a). 
(1.13)
aa
Proof Let F = uv; then FA(t) = uA(t)v(t) + u(a(t))vA(t) and FA is A - 
integrable. Now Theorem 1.25 shows that fb FA(t)At = F(b) - F(a) = 
u(b)v(b) - u(a)v(a) and so (1.13) holds. The proof is completed. 
□
Theorem 1.27 (see [112, 113], Fundamental Theorem of Calculus II) Let f be 
a function which is A-integrable from a to b. For t e [a, b ]T, let F(t) = ft f(s)As. 
Then F is continuous on [a, b]T. Further, let t0 e[a, b)T and letfbe arbitrary at t0 
if t0 is right-scattered, and let f be continuous at t0 if t0 is right-dense. Then F is 
A-differentiable at t0 and F A(t0) = f (t0).
Proof Choose B > 0 such that | f (t)| < B for all t e [a, b)T. If t, t e [a, b]T and 
|t - T | < s/B where t<T, say, then
|F(T) - F(t)| = f f(s)As < 
| f (s)|As < BAs = B(t - t) < s.
This shows that F is (uniformly) continuous on [a, b]T. Let t0 e[a, b)T be right- 
scattered. Then, since F is continuous, it is A-differentiable at t0 and we have by 
Theorems 1.14 and 1.7,
F A(t0) = lim

A function F : [ a, b ]T ^ R is said to be a A -preantiderivative of f : [ a, b) T ^ 
R provided F is continuous on [a, b]T and A-predifferentiable on [a, b)T with 
region of A-differentiation D c [a, b)T, and FA(t) = f(t) for all t e D.
The following result is a generalization of Theorem 1.25:
Theorem 1.28 Let f be a A-integrable function on [a, b)T.IffhasaA- 
preantiderivative F : [a, b]T ^ R, then fb f (t)At = F(b) — F(a).
Proof The proof is analogous to that of Theorem 1.25 and uses Theorem 1.24. 
□
Let T be a time scale and a and p be the forward and backward jump functions 
on T. The following knowledge is about A-measure on time scales and can be found 
in [69].
Let J1 be the family (collection) of all left closed and right open intervals of 
T of the form [a, b)t = {t e T : a < t < b} with a,b e T and a < b. The 
interval [a, a)T is understood as the empty set. J1 is a semiring of subsets of T. 
Let m 1 : J1 ^ [0, rc>) be the set function on J1 (whose values belong to the 
extended real half-line [0, rc>)) that assigns to each interval [a, b)T its length b — a : 
m1 ([a, b)T) = b — a. Then m1 is a countably additive measure on J1. We denote 
by p.A the Caratheodory extension of the set function m 1 associated with family J1 
(for the Caratheodory extension, see [39]) and call p.A the Lebesgue A-measure on 
T.
Now we briefly describe the Caratheodory extension p.A of m 1. First, using the 
pair (J1, m i), an outer measure m| is generated on the family of all subsets of T as 
follows:
Let E be any subset of T. If there exists at least one finite or countable system 
of intervals Vj e J1 (j = 1, 2,...) such that E c Uj Vj, then we put m|(E) = 
infmi(Vj), where the infimum is taken over all coverings of E by a finite or 
j

16
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
countable system of intervals Vj e J1. If there is no such covering of E, then we 
put m J (E) = to. Second, we define the family M(mJ) of all mJ-measurable subsets 
ofT.
Definition 1.9 (see [69, 86, 87]) A subset A of T is called mJ-measurable (or Л- 
measurable) if mJ (E) = mJ (E П A) + mJ (E A Ac) holds for all E C T, where 
Ac denotes the complement of A : Ac = T - A. The family M(m1J) of all m1J- 
measurable subsets of T is a a -algebra.
Third, we take the restriction of m J to M(mJ), which we denote by //Л. This ^Л 
(the Lebesgue Л-measure) is a countably additive measure on M(m J).
All intervals of family J1 including the empty set are Л-measurable. From the 
definition it is obvious that the T is also Л-measurable. Suppose that T has a finite 
maximum т0. Obviously, the set X = T - {т0} can be represented as a finite 
or countable union of intervals of the family J1 and, therefore, is Л-measurable. 
Consequently, the single-point set {т0} = T - X is Л-measurable as the difference 
of two measurable sets T and X. Evidently, the single-point set {т0} does not have 
a finite or countable covering by intervals of J1. Therefore, the single-point set {т0} 
and also any Л -measurable subset of T containing т0 have Л-measure infinity.
Remark 1.3 According to definition of the Л-measure, the Л-measure of the max 
of a time scale which is bounded above is equal to infinity. In fact, if a subset E 
of the time scale is not coverable (by finite or countable systems of intervals from 
J1), then its outer measure is assumed to be infinity. This assumption guarantees the 
needed monotonicity of an outer measure.
Theorem 1.29 (see [69, 86, 87]) For each t0 in T - maxT, the single-point set {t0} 
is Л-mieasiircible, and its Л-measure is given by
Ea({10}) = a(t0) - 10. 
(1.14)
Proof If t0 is right-scattered, then {t0} = [t0,a(t0))T e J1. Therefore, {t0} is Л- 
measurable, and we have i±&(t0) = m 1 ([10,a(t0))T) = a(t0) - t0, which is the 
desired result. Further consider the case when t0 is right-dense. In this case there 
exists a decreasing sequence (tk) of points of T such that tk > 10 and tk ^ 10. Then 
TO
[10,t 1)t э [t0,t2)t э ••• and {t0} = П [10, tk)t. Hence {10} is Л-measurable
k=1
as a countable intersection of Л-measurable sets, and by the continuity property 
of the countably additive measure ^Л, we have ^Л({10}) = lim ^Л([10, tk)T) = 
k ^TO
lim (tk - t0) = 0, and so (1.14) holds in this case as well. The proof is completed. 
k ^TO
□
For each single-point subset of T is Л-measurable and every kind of interval 
can be obtained from an interval of the form [a, b)T by adding or subtracting the 
endpoints a and b, each interval of T is Л-measurable. For evaluating the Л-measure 
of any interval of T, the following theorem gives the formulas:

1.1 Riemann Integration on Time Scales
17
Theorem 1.30 (see [69, 86, 87]) If a,b e T and a < b, then
да([a,b)T) = b - a, 
EA((a,b)t) = b - o(a). 
(1.15)
If a, b e T — maxT and a < b, then
^A((a,b]t) = v(b) — °(a), 
да([a,b]t) = °(b) - a. 
(1.16)
Proof The first formula of (1.15) is obvious, since дА([a, b)T) = m 1 ([a, b)T) = 
b — a .To prove the second one, we write [ a, b) T = {a} U (a, b) T. Hence by the 
additivity of дА, we have дА([a, b)T) = дА({a}) + дА((и, b)T). This gives, using 
Theorem 1.29, b — a = a(a) — a + дА((и, b)T) and, therefore, the second formula 
of (1.15) holds. Similarly, the formulas of (1.16) can be proved. This completes the 
proof. 
□
Accordingly, the concept of the Lebesgue V-measure on T can be established 
(see [69, 86, 87]).
Let J2 denote the family of all right closed and left open intervals of T of the 
form (a, b]t = {t e T : a < t < b} with a, b e T and a < b. The interval 
(a, a]T is understood as the empty set. J2 is a semiring of subsets of T. Further, let 
m2 : J2 ^ [0, rc>) be the set function on J2 assigned to each interval (a, b]t its 
length b — a : m2 ((a, b]T) = b — a. Then m2 is a countably additive measure on 
J2. We denote by дА the Caratheodory extension of the set function m2 associated 
with the family J2 and call дV the Lebesgue V-measure on T.
Similar to the proof of Theorems 1.29 and 1.30, the following two theorems 
follow easily:
Theorem 1.31 (see [86]) For each t0 in T — {minT}, the V-measure of the single­
point set {t0} is given by дV({to}) = tо — p(tо).
Theorem 1.32 (see [69, 86, 87]) If a,b e T and a < b, then
дV((a, b]t) = b — a, дv((a, b)t) = p(b) — a.
If a, b e T — {min T} and a < b, then
дv([a, b)t) = p(b) — p(a), дv([a, b]t) = b — p(a).
Remark 1.4 For T = R both measures дА and дV coincide with the usual 
Lebesgue measure on R. For T = Z, we also have дА = дV, and for any subset 
E c Z, дА(Е) = д V (E) coincide with the number of points of the set E.
Definition 1.10 (see [112, 113]) The Lebesgue integral associated with the mea­
sures дА and д V on T is called the Lebesgue A -integral and the Lebesgue 
V-integral on T, respectively. For a (measurable) set E c T and a (measurable)

18
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
function f : E ^ R, the corresponding integrals of f over E are denoted by 
Ee f(t)At and fE f(t)Vt, respectively.
Therefore, all theorems of the general Lebesgue integration theory, including the 
Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem, are valid for the Lebesgue delta and 
nabla integrals on T.
The following theorem is a comparison of the Lebesgue A-integral with the 
Riemann V -integral:
Theorem 1.33 (see [112, 113]) Let [a, b)T be a half-closed bounded interval in 
T and let f be a bounded real-valued function on [a, b)T. If f is Riemann 
A-integrable from a to b, then f is Lebesgue A-integrable on [a, b)T, and 
R fb f (t )At = L faa b)T f (t)At, where R and L indicate the Riemann and 
Lebesgue integrals, respectively.
Proof Suppose that f is Riemann A-integrable from a to b. Then, by Theorem 1.4, 
for each positive integer k, we can choose 8k > 0 (8k ^ 0 as k ^ to) and a 
(k) 
(k) 
(k)
partition Pk : a = 10' < t< • • • < tnf) = b of [a, b)T such that Pk e Jgk and 
U(f, Pk) - L(f, Pk) < 1/k. Hence
lim L(f, Pk) = lim U(f,Pk) = R b f(t)At. 
(1.17)

By replacing the partitions Pk with finer partitions if necessary, we can assume that 
for each k the partition Pk+1 is a refinement of the partition Pk . Let us set

Mi = sup{f (t) : t e [ti-1 ,ti )T}
(1.18)
for i = 1, 2,... ,n(k) and define sequences (vk) and ф) of functions on [a, b)T 
by letting
Vk(t) = m(kk and 4>k(t) = M(k, for t e [ t(k), t(kk) T, i = 1, 2,..., n(k).
(1.19)
Then (pk) is a nondecreasing and (фk) is a nonincreasing sequence of simple A - 
measurable functions. For each k, we have
Vk < <Pk +1, 
Фk > Фk +1, 
(1.20)
Vk < f < Ф^

Vk(t)At = L(f,Pk), 
L 
Ф^А = U(f,Pk).

1.1 Riemann Integration on Time Scales

Since f is bounded, the sequences (pk) and (фк) are bounded by (1.18) and (1.19). 
Taking into account, in addition, the monotonicity (1.20) we conclude that there 
exist the limit functions
p(t) = lim pk(t), ф(Г) = lim фк(Ь), t e[a,b)t. 
(1.23)
k ^TO 
k ^TO
It follows from (1.21) that
p(t) < f(t) < ф(к), t e[a,b)T. 
(1.24)
The functions p and ф are A-measurable as limits (1.23) of the A -measurable 
functions pk and фк, respectively. Lebesgue’s dominated convergence theorem 
implies that p and ф are Lebesgue A -integrable on [ a, b) T and
lim L pk (t)At = L p(t)At and

Therefore passing on to the limit in (1.22) as k ^ to and taking into account (1.17), 
we get
L [ p(t)At = L y[ 
ф(ЬА = Rf(t)At. 
(1.26)
From (1.26) we have
bf 
[Ф(Ф) - p(t)]At = 0. 
(1.27)
[a,b)T
Since in addition ф(к) - p(t) 0 for all t in [a, bTT, (1.27) implies
p(t) = ф(Ь) for A — almost every t in [a, b)t. 
(1.28)
So (1.28) and (1.24) show that f(t) = p(t) A-almost everywhere on [a, b)T. It 
follows that f is Lebesgue A-integrable, and by (1.26), the Lebesgue A-integral 
of f over [a, b)T coincides with the Riemann A-integral of f from a to b. This 
completes the proof. 
□
A “Lebesgue criterion” for Riemann A-integrability is derived as follows:
Theorem 1.34 (see [112, 113]) Let f be a bounded function defined on the half­
closed bounded interval [a, b)T of T. Then f is Riemann A-integrable from a to b 
if and only if the set of all right-dense points of [a, b)T at which f is discontinuous 
is a set of A-measure zero.

20
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
Proof Assume that f is Riemann A-integrable from a to b. For each positive integer 
k, let a partition Pk of [a, b)T and the functions yk, фк, ф, and ф be defined as in the 
proof of Theorem 1.33. Let us set
to 
л = и Pk, 
k=1
Ard = {t e [a, b)T : t e Л and t is right-dense}, (1.29)
G = {t e [a, b) : f is discontinuous at t},
Grd ={t e G : t is right-dense},
(1.30)
A = {t e[a,b)T : V(t) — ф(Ь)}. 
(1.31)
Assume t is a point in [a, b)T such that
v(t) = f(t) = <Mt)
(1.32)
and that t is not in Л. Then f is continuous at t ; for otherwise there would exist 
e > 0 and a sequence (tj), limtj = t, such that | f (tj) — f(t)| > e for each j. But 
then ф(Ь) y(t) + e, which contradicts the assumption (1.32).
Note that for each right-scattered point t of [a, b)T, the equality (1.32) holds. 
Indeed, it is easy to see that all right-scattered points of [a, b)T belong to Л (i.e., 
they are partition points). Therefore, for each right-scattered point t of [a, b)T and 
all sufficiently large k, we have vk(t) = fk(t) = f(t), and hence v(t) = ф(Ь).
Consequently,
Grd c (A U Ard).
(1.33)
Further, ^a(A) = 0 by the proof of Theorem 1.33 (see (1.28)), and p.A(Ard) = 0 
by the fact that Л, and therefore Ard, is at most countable and that each right-dense 
point has A-measure zero. So from (1.33), it follows that ^A(Grd) = 0 and the first 
part of the theorem is proved.
Conversely, suppose that the set of all right-dense points of [a, b)T at which f is 
discontinuous is of A-measure zero: ^A(Grd) = 0. For each positive integer k, we 
choose 8k > 0 (8k ^ 0 as k ^ те) and a partition Pk : a — t0 < 11 < < • • • < 
t^kk) — b of [a, b)T such that Pk e J8k and that Pk +1 is a refinement of Pk. Further, 
let <pk, Фк, V, and ф be defined as before. So for each k, we have vk < Vk +1, Фк 
Фk +1 ,Vk < f < Фk and v(t) — lim Vk(t), ф(t) — lim фk(t),ф(t) < f(t) < 
k ^to 
k ^to
ф(Ь), t e [a, b)T.
Now assume that t e[a, b)T is a right-dense point and that f is continuous at 
t. Then, given e > 0, there exists 8 > 0 such that sup f — inf f < e, where the 

1.1 Riemann Integration on Time Scales
21
supremum and infimum are taken over (t - S,t + 3)T = {s e [a, b)T : t - S < 
s < t + S}. For all k sufficiently large, a subinterval of Pk containing t will be in 
(t — S,t + S)T, and so фк(Г) — <pk(t) < e. But e is arbitrary, so <p(t) = ф(Ь). Next, 
at each right-scattered point t of [a, b)T , we have, as above in the first part of the 
proof, <p(t) = ф(Г).
So we have shown that y(t) = Ф(Ь) provided either t is right-dense and f 
is continuous at t or t is right-scattered. Therefore we have the inclusion A c 
Grd, where A and Grd are defined by (1.31) and (1.30), respectively. Hence, 
since ^A(Grd) = 0 by our assumption, we get that ^a(A) = 0. Consequently, 
p(t) = ф(Ь) A-almost everywhere on [a, b)T. This implies that L j^a b)T <p(t)At = 
L f[ab)T Ф^'А and, therefore, taking into account (1.25) and (1.22), we get 
limk—to L(f, Pk) = limk— to U(f, Pk). This shows, by Theorem 1.3, that f is 
Riemann A -integrable on [ a, b) T. The proof is completed. 
□
Theorem 1.35 (see [112, 113]) Every bounded function f :[a, b)T - R having 
only finitely or countably many right-dense discontinuous points in [a, b)T is 
Riemann A-integrable from a to b. In particular, every bounded continuous function 
on [a, b)T is Riemann A-integrable.
Proof By Theorem 1.29, every right-dense point in T has the A-measure zero, and 
hence, by countably additivity of the A-measure, every finite or countable set of 
right-dense points has A-measure zero. Consequently, applying Theorem 1.34, we 
can obtain the desired result. This completes the proof. 
□
Definition 1.11 (see [61, 63]) A function f : T - R is called rd-continuous 
provided it is continuous at right-dense points in T and its left-sided limits exist 
(finite) at all left-dense points in T.
Remark 1.5 Note that every continuous function is rd-continuous. The jump oper­
ator a, in general, is not continuous but it is rd-continuous.
Definition 1.12 (see [61, 63]) A function f : T - R is called regulated provided 
its right-sided limits exist (finite) at all right-dense points in T and its left-sided 
limits exist (finite) at all left-dense points in T.
Remark 1.6 Note that every rd-continuous and also every monotonic function are 
regulated.
Theorem 1.36 (see [112, 113]) Every regulated function f :[a, b]T - R,in 
particular, every monotonic function on [a, b]T, is Riemann A-integrable from a 
to b.
Proof Noticing that every regulated function on a compact interval is bounded (see 
[61], Theorem 1.65), we now show that every regulated function on a compact 
interval may have at most countably many discontinuous points in this interval. It is 

22
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
sufficient to show that for each positive integer n, the set
1
Gn = t e [a, b]t : I f(t + 0) - f(t - 0) I > - 
n
is finite. Then the set of all discontinuity points of f in [a, b]T to be the union of the 
sets Gn for n = 1, 2,... will be at most countable. Assume, on the contrary, that 
Gn contains infinitely many points t1 ,t2 , ... so that
I f(tk + 0) - f(tk — о) I > 1 (k = 1, 2,...). 
(1.34)
n
Since tk e[a, b]T for all k = 1, 2, ... , we may assume, passing to a subsequence 
of {tk} if it is necessary, that
lim tk = t0 for some t0 e[a, b]T . 
(1.35)
k ^to
Note that t0 e T since tk e T (k = 1, 2,...)and T is closed. By (1.35), there exists 
a subsequence that tends to t0 from above or a subsequence that tends to t0 from 
below, and in any case the limit of f (t) as t ^ tо has to exist (finite) according 
to regularity. But this contradicts (1.34). Applying Theorem 1.34 we can get the 
desired result. This completes the proof. 
□
The following analogues of Theorems 1.33 and 1.34 for the nabla integral can 
also be obtained similarly.
Theorem 1.37 (see [112, 113]) Let (a, b]T be a half-closed bounded interval in T, 
and let f be a bounded real-valued function on (a, b ]t . Iff is Riemann V-integrable 
from a to b, then f is Lebesgue V-integrable on (a,b]t, and R fb f(t)Vt = 
L I 
f(t) Vt.
(a,b]T
Theorem 1.38 (see [112, 113]) Let f be a bounded function defined on the half­
closed bounded interval (a, b]T ofT. Then f is Riemann V-integrable from a to b 
if and only if the set of all left-dense points of (a, b]T at which f is discontinuous is 
a set of V-measure zero.
1.2 Stochastic Calculus and Dynamic Equations on Time 
Scales
In this section, we will introduce some basic knowledge of stochastic calculus on 
time scales (see [66]). Based on this, some fundamental results of linear stochastic 
dynamic equations will be introduced which will be used to study stochastic 
dynamic models in the later chapters.

1.2.1 Relation Between Classical Integrable Functions and
Д-Integrable Functions
In this subsection, the connection between A-Riemann integrable functions and 
Riemann integrable functions is introduced as well as the connection between A - 
Lebesgue integrable functions and Lebesgue integrable functions. These results 
constitute a key point in our construction of Ito-type stochastic integrals on general 
time scales. Let T be a time scale. We choose a couple of finite points a,b e T such 
that a < b. Let us consider the segment [a, b]T = [a,b] П T and the real-valued 
function f : [a, b]T ^ R. We now present the definition of the A-Riemann integral 
of the function f on [a, b]T (see [63], page 118). Let
P = {a = tо < t1 <...< tn = b : ti e T for 1 < i < n — 1}
be some partition of the interval [a, b]T. We denote the set of all partitions of [a, b]T 
by P(a, b).
Definition 1.13 (see [66]) Let f : [ a, b ]t ^ R be a function. The upper A - 
Darboux sum U(f, P) and the lower A-Darboux sum L(f, P) of f with respect 
to the partition
P = {a = tо < t1 < ... < tn = b : ti e T for 1 < i < n — 1} e P(a, b)
are given by
nn
U(f, P) = 
Mi(ti — ti—1) L(f, P) = 
mi(ti — ti—1),
respectively, where
Mi = 
sup f(t) and mi = inf f(t) for all 1 < i < n.
te[ti—1,ti)T 
te[ti—1,ti)T
The upper A-Darboux integral U(f) and the lower A-Darboux integral L(f) of f 
on the interval [a, b]T are defined by
U(f) = inf U(f, P) and L(f) = sup L(f, P), 
P eP(a,b) 
P eP(a,b)
respectively. Moreover, if U(f) = L(f), then we say that f is A-integrable on the 
interval [a, b]T and set
bfAt=U(f)=L(f),
a 

24
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
the common value of the upper and lower A-Darboux integrals.
Without loss of generality, we may assume that 0, 1 e T and we put a = 0 and 
b = 1. As before, we denote [0, 1]T = [0, 1] П T. Let a function f : [0, 1]T ^ R 
be given. We will show that an integral
1 fAt 
(1.36)
0
on the time scale [0, 1]T could be defined in another way (different from [63]), and 
the value of this integral coincides with the value of (1.36).
Definition 1.14 ([66]) For a function f : [0, 1]T ^ R, we define the extension 
f : [0, 1]^ R by
f (t) = f (sup[0, t]t) 
for all t e [0, 1].
Remark 1.7 Note that ff(t) = f(t)ift e[0, 1]T. If t e[0, 1]\[0, 1]T, then ff(t) = 
f(s), where s is the nearest left-hand point to the point t such that s e T. The 
function f(t) is well defined by Definition 1.14. In fact, for t e[0, 1], define the 
set S = [0, 1]T П [0, t]. Evidently, the set S is compact. Consider the function 
ф^') = t — s, s e S. Obviously, the function ф is continuous, monotone, and defined 
on the compact set. Hence, there exists a unique element s* e S satisfying ф^*) = 
infseS ф^'). The point s* is the nearest left-hand point to the point t such that s* e 
T,soff(t)= f(s*).
The connection between the A-Riemann integral of f on the interval [0, 1]T and 
f
the Riemann integral of f on the interval [0, 1] was presented as follows:
Theorem 1.39 (see [66]) The function f : [0, 1]t ^ R is A-Riemann integrable 
f
on the interval [0, 1]T if and only if the function f : [0, 1] ^ R is Riemann 
integrable on the interval [0, 1], and then the following integrals are equal:
1 f(t)At = 
1 ff(t)dt. 
(1.37)
Proof This statement can be proved by using Darboux sums. Let P e P(0, 1) be 
some partition of the interval [0, 1]T:
P = {0 = t0 < t1 < ...<tn = 1 : ti e T for all 1 < i < n — 1}.
The lower A-Darboux sum for this partition is

L(f,P) 5' mi(ti - ti-1), where mi = inf f(t), 
1 < i < n.

This partition is also a partition for the whole interval [0, 1]. Thus

where mi = inf f, 1 < i

Since the setoff values on [ti-1, ti) coincides with the setoff values on [ti-1, ti)T, 
^ 
р
we obtain mi = mi for all 1 < i < n and hence L(f, P) = L(f, P). Similarly, 
р
we can show U(f, P) = U(f, P). This proves that any A-Darboux sum for f with 
р
respect to the partition P is the same as the Darboux sum for f with respect to the 
р
same partition P. Now let P(0, 1) be the set of all partitions of the interval [0, 1], 
and as before denote by P(0, 1) the set of all partitions of the interval [0, 1]T. It 
follows that
р
P(0, 1) C P(0, 1).
From (1.38), it follows that
р р

L(f) = sup L(f,P) < sup L(f,P) = L(f)

рё P (0, 1)

P ё P( 0, 1)
< inf U(f, P).
P ё P( 0, 1)
Consequently,
L(f) < L(f) < U(f) < U(f).
(1.38)
(1.39)
From (1.39), we conclude that if the function f is A-Riemann integrable, then the 
function f is Riemann integrable and (1.37) holds.
On the other hand, let f be Riemann integrable. We will show that f is A- 
Riemann integrable. Let us use the criterion of A-integrability (see [63], Theorem 
5.6) which says that a function f is A-integrable if and only if for any e > 0, there 
exists P ё P(0, 1) such that
U(f, P) - L(f, P) < e.

26
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
P
Indeed, first we fix some e > 0. Since the function f is Riemann integral, there 
P
exists P e P (0, 1) such that the inequality
P P 
P P
U(f, P) - L(f,P) <e 
(1.40)
holds. Let
P = {0 = 10 <t 1 < ...<tn = 1 : ti e T for 1 < i < n - 1} e P(0, 1).
P
Using P , we construct a subpartition in the subsequent way. If t1 e[0, 1]T, then we
P
pass to the next point of P.Ift1 =[0, 1]T, then there exist points s1, s2 e[0, 1]T 
(possibly ^ 1 = 0, s2 = 1) such that 0 < s 1 <t1 <s2 and subsequently
f(t) = f(s1), t e [s1,s2).
Without loss of generality, we may choose s2 <t2. We add the points s1 ,s2 to the 
P
partition P . It is obvious that
PP 
inf f(t) = inf f(t) = f(s1). 
te[s1,t1) 
te[t1,s2)
Consequently
m1s1 + f (s1)(t1 - s1) + f (s1)(s2 - t1) = m1s1 + f (s1)(s2 - s1).
P
This shows that the “part” of the lower Darboux sum for f with respect to the points 
0 <s1 <t1 <s2 of the partition of [0, 1] coincides with the “part” of the lower 
Darboux sum for f with respect to the points 0 <s1 < s2. From s2 to t2, we 
P
repeat this procedure, and so on, until we go over all the points of the partition P. 
PP
As a result, we obtain two partitions. First, Q e P is a partition of the interval 
[0, 1] which is constructed by adding the points {si} to the points {ti}. The second 
partition Q e P(0, 1) consists of all points {si}. In view of these subpartitions’ 
constructions, it is easy to see that
PP
L(f, Q) = L(f, Q). 
(1.41)
Similarly,
PP
U(f, Q) = U(f, Q). 
(1.42)

Apparently, Q is a subpartition of P . It follows that 
f f 
f f 
f f 
f f
L(f, P) < L(f, Q) < U(f,Q) < U(f, P).

Due to (1.40), (1.41), (1.42), and (1.43), we obtain 
f f 
f f 
f f 
f f
U(f, Q) - L(f, Q) = U(f, Q) - L(f, Q) < U(f, P) - L(f, P) < e,
which establishes the integrability criterion. Therefore, f is A-integrable so that
U(f) = L(f). From (1.38), we obtain (1.37). This completes the proof. 
□
Similar to the proof of Theorem 1.39, the connection between the A-Lebesgue 
f
integral of f on the interval [0, 1]T and the Lebesgue integral of f on the interval 
[0, 1] is immediate.
Theorem 1.40 (see [66]) The function f : [0, 1]T ^ R is A-Lebesgue integrable 
f
on the interval [0, 1]T if and only if the function f : [0, 1] ^ R is Lebesgue 
integrable on the interval [0, 1], and then the following integrals are equal:
[ 
f(t)kA( d t) = j f FF( d t),
where X(•) is the Lebesgue measure and kA(•) is the A-Lebesgue measure on T.
1.2.2 Stochastic Calculus
According to Theorem 1.40, the stochastic integral on general time scale can be 
constructed. Let (Q, F, P) be a probability space. Let W be a standard Wiener 
process and suppose
{W(t + h) — W(t) : h 0} is independent of Ft := a{W(s) : 0 < s < t},
where FR := {Ft : t e R} is a filtration on R, and with a {•}, we mean the a-algebra 
generated by •. We construct a A-stochastic integral on [0, 1]T, denoted by
1 f(t)AW(t). 
0
First of all we determine the class H 2([0, 1]T) of random processes.
Definition 1.15 (see [66]) We say that the random process f : Tx Q ^ R belongs 
to class H 2([0, 1]T) if the following conditions hold:

28
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
(i) f is adapted to FT; i.e., f (t, •) is Ft-measurable for all t e [0, 1]T.
(ii) P(/o1 | f(t,F) |2At< <x>) = 1.
f
By adopting f e H 2([0, 1]T), we define the random process f on [0, 1] by 
f(t,rn) = f( sup[0 ,t ]T ,ш).
f
Proposition 1.1 (see [66]) The process f has the following properties: 
f 
f
(i) f is adapted to FR, i.e., f(t, •) is Ft-measurable for all t e [0, 1]. 
f
(ii) P(/o I f (t, ш) I2dt < M = 1.
f
Proof The first property follows from the construction of f. The second property 
follows from Theorem 1.40. The proof is completed. 
□
According to Proposition 1.1, starting with the processes f e H 2([0, 1]T) 
f
creates a family of processes f for which the Ito stochastic integral in the common 
sense is defined. Hence, the A-stochastic integral in the subsequent definition is well 
defined.
Definition 1.16 (see [66]) We say that the random process f e H 2([0, 1]T) has 
f
a A-stochastic integral on [0, 1]T provided the corresponding process f has a 
stochastic integral in the common sense on [0, 1], and then we set
£ f(t)AW(t) := j1 f (t)dW(t).
Remark 1.8 Note that for T = R, the integral given as in Definition 1.16 coincides 
with the common Ito stochastic integral, and in the case ofan isolated time scale, the 
integral given as in Definition 1.16 coincides with the integral introduced by Suman 
Sanyal [64, 163].
By Definition 1.16, it easily follows that the A-stochastic integral has all the 
properties of the common Ito stochastic integral without proofs.
Proposition 1.2 (see [66]) The A-stochastic integral has the following properties:
(i) If f1,f2 e H 2([0, 1]T) and c1,c2 e R, then
f (c i f1 (t) + C 2 f2 (t)) AW(t) = c if f1 (t)AW(t) + c 2 f f2 (t)AW(t).

(ii) If E^/01 | f(t)|2A^ < те, then
e(f(t)AW(t^ = 0
and the Ito-isometry holds:
E (([ 1 f(t)AW(t)V) = E (f 1 f2(t)At
00
Now the A-stochastic differential can be introduced in a standard way.
Definition 1.17 (see [66]) If for all t1 ,t2 e [0, 1 ]t such that t1 < t2 we have
t2 
t2
X(t2) - X(t1) = b(t, X)At + B(t, X)AW (t), 
(1.44)
t1 
t1
where b is Lebesgue integrable on [0, 1]T and B e H 2([0, 1]T), then we say that 
the process X has a A-stochastic differential indicated by the notation
AX(t) = b(t, X)At + B(t, X)AW (t).
In the equality (1.44), the first integral is the common Lebesgue integral, and the 
second integral is the A-stochastic integral.
1.2.3 Stochastic Dynamic Equations on Time Scales
Based on Definition 1.17, the concept of stochastic dynamic equations on general 
time scales can be introduced. Let T be a general time scale such that sup T =те. 
We consider the stochastic dynamic equation on [0, a]t c T
AX(t) = b(X, t)At + B(X,t)AW(t) 
(1.45)
with initial condition
X(0) = X0, 
(1.46)
where X0 is a random variable, independent of W(t). In the following, under 
filtration, we understand Ft = о{X0, W. : s < t}.

30
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
Definition 1.18 (see [66]) We say that a random process X(t) with X(0) = X0 
is a solution of the stochastic dynamic equation (1.45) on [0, a]T if the following 
conditions hold:
(i) X is adapted to the filtration F.
(ii) For all t e [0, a]T, we have almost surely
X(t) = Xо + 
b(X(s),s)As + jT B(X(s), s)A^(s). 
(1.47)
To present an existence and uniqueness theorem, we first give the following 
subsequent definition:
Definition 1.19 (see [66]) The function p : [0, a] ^ R is said to be continuous 
at the point tо e [0, a]T if for each sequence {tn e [0, a]T} such that tn ^ tо as 
n ^ те, we have <p(tn) ^ y(t0) as n ^ те.
The following theorem is a result on the existence and uniqueness of solutions of 
stochastic dynamic equations on time scales:
Theorem 1.41 (see [66]) Let the following conditions hold:
(i) The functions b, B : R x [0, a]T ^ R are continuous.
(ii) There exists a constant L>0 such that for each x1, x2 e R and all t e [0,a]T, 
we have
|b(x 1 ,t) - b(x2,t)| < L|x 1 - x2|, |B(x 1 ,t) - B(x2,t)| < L|x 1 - x2I,
(1.48) 
and
|b(x,t)| < L( 1 + |x|), 
|B(x,t)| < L( 1 + |x|). 
(1.49)
(iii) The real-valued random variable X0 satisfies the inequality E |X0|2 < w 
and is independent ofW(t)for t>0.
Then there exists with probability P = 1 a continuous solution X on [0, a]T of the 
stochastic dynamic equation (1.45) with initial condition (1.46) such that
eQ^ X2(т)Лт) < те. 
(1.50)
~
Moreover, if X and X are both such solutions, then
PI sup | X(t) - X (t) |= 0) = 1.
t e[0,a]T

1.2 Stochastic Calculus and Dynamic Equations on Time Scales
31
Proof First we show uniqueness. Obviously, the set [0, a]T is closed and bounded 
and thus is compact. Due to compactness of the set [0, a]T, for all e > 0, there 
exists a finite e-net {t1, 12,..., tn}. Hence we can chose the sequence {ej} such that 
for each ej = (1/2)j -1, there exists a finite ej -net Sej ={t1j,...,tnj} for [0, a]T. 
Now let Se = Uj Sej. In view of the construction, the set S is everywhere dense 
~
on [0, a]T. Let the processes X and X be solutions of Equation (1.45) with initial 
condition (1.46). On the basis of the a.s. continuity of the solutions and the fact that 
the set Se is everywhere dense, then
P( sup |X(t) - X(t)|= 0) = P( sup |X(t) - X(t)|= 0) = 1. 
t e Se 
t e[0 ,a ]T
Now we show existence. We will employ the method of iteration. For this purpose, 
we define
X0(t) := X0,
Xn(t) := X0 + jT b(Xn-1 (s),s) As + 
B (Xn-1 (s),s)AW(s),
where n e N and t e [0,a]T . Also we introduce
3n(t) := E(|Xn+1 (s) - Xn(s)|).
Let us show that the inequality
8n(t) < Mn+1 hn +1 (t, 0) 
(1.51)
holds for some constant M, which depends on L, a , and X0, and for all n e N, 
t e [0,a]T, where hn are the generalized monomials [61, Section 1.6]. Let us check 
(1.51) forn = 0:
30(t) = E(|X1 (s) - X0(s) |2)
= E( t b(X0,s)As +

where we set M = 4L2 (1 + | X0|)2. This confirms (1.51) for n = 0. Suppose now 
that the inequality (1.51) holds for some n — 1. Then
&n(t) = e{ |xn+1 (s) — Xn(s)|2

where we choose M 
2(a + 1 )L2. This proves the inequality (1.51). Using the
Lipschitz property of the function b(X, t), we have

where C = 2L2(a + 4). Therefore, let us apply the Borel-Cantelli lemma, since

imply

In view of this, for almost every ш, the series
n-1
X0 + 
Xj++1 - X')

converges uniformly. The partial sum of this series is an a.s. uniform bound of Xn 
and so Xn ^ X as n ^ те. Thus we have

1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
X(t) = X0 + jT b(X(s),s)As + jT B(X(s),s)AW(s) for all t e [0, a]T.
The process X is continuous being an a.s. uniform bound of a.s. continuous 
processes.
Let us show that (1.50) is valid. We observe
E (|Xn +1 (t)|2) < CE(|X0|2) + CE 
b(Xn(s),s)As
B(Xn(s),s)AW(s)

where by C we denote a constant. By induction, we get
e( | Xn+1 (t) |2) < (c + C2 h 1 (t, 0) + ... + Cn+2 hn+1 (t, 0)) (1 + E (| X o|2 )).
It follows that
E (|Xn +1 (t)|2) < C(1 + E(|Xо|2))ec(t, 0), 
where eC(•, 0) is a time scale exponential function (see [61], Section 2.2). As n ^ 
те, we obtain
E (|X(t)|2) < C( 1 + E(|Xo|2))eC(t, 0) for all t e [0, a]t, 
and thus

= (1 + E(|Xo|2))(eC(t, 0) - 1) < те,
which proves (1.50). The proof is completed.
□
Next, we consider the Markov property of solutions of stochastic dynamic 
equations. Notice that Theorem 1.40 could be reformulated in an obvious way for 
the case when instead of [0, a]T, now consider [u, a]T c T, where u > 0. Thus we 
consider the equation

We denote this solution Z by Zf(t), t e [u,a]T. For the process X = 
{X(t) : t e [0, a ]t} , which is a solution of Eqs. (1.45) and (1.46), we have
X(t) = Xо + jT b(X(s),s)As + 
B(X(s),s)A^(s)
= Xо + f b(X(s),s)As +[ B(X(s),s)A^(s)

+ ^ b(X(s),s)As + j B(X(s),s)A^(s)
= X(u) + f b(X(s),s)As + f B(X(s),s)AW(s).
The following auxiliary results will be used later:
Lemma 1.4 (see [66]) Let the process Y = {Y(s) : s e T} be progressively 
measurable on the time scale T with respect to the filtration FT = (Fs )seT in 
F. Let the real-valued function a(s,x) be defined on T x R and suppose it is 
B(T) ® B(R)-measurable. Then the process U = {U(t) = a (Y(t), t) : t e T} 
is progressively FT -measurable.
Proof First we show B([0,t]) ® Ft |B([0,t]) ® B(R)-measurability of the 
mappings {(s, rn) ^ (s, Ys(a>)) for 0 < s < t and ш e Q. Let 0 < u < t and 
B e B(R). Then
{(s, ш) e [0,t] ® Q : (s, Ys(o)) e [0, u] ® B}
= {(s, ш) e [0,t л u] ® Q : Ys(v) e B}
C B([0, t л u]) ® Ftлu C B([0, t]) ® Ft.
For (s, x) e [0,t] x Q, the mapping (s, x) ^ a(s, x) is B([0, t]) ® B(R)- 
measurable as a superposition of measurable mappings. The proof is completed.

Lemma 1.5 (see [66]) Let the functions b, B : Tx R ^ R satisfy conditions (1.48) 
and (1.49). Suppose that the value Z is F0-measurable and that E (Z2) < ж. Then 
the process X(n') = X(n')(t) : t e T is well defined by expression (1.54), and it is 
also progressively measurable. Thus supteT E(|X(n')(t) |2) < ж for all n e N and 
the right-hand side of (1.54) can be chosen a.s. continuous on T.
Proof The process Ys(a>) = Z(F), where s e T and ш e fi, is progressively 
measurable since Z e F01B(R). Due to Lemma 1.4, the functions b(s, Z(rn)) and 
B(s, Z(rn)) are progressively measurable. In view of conditions (1.48) and (1.49) 
on the function B, we have
sup E(B2(s, Z)) < c(1 + E(Z2)) < ж.
seT
As a result, we have {B(s, Z) : s e T} e AT П L T, and ft B(s, Z)AW(s) for t e T 
can be chosen a.s. continuous. Taking into account the progressive measurability of 
{b(s, Z) : s e T} and conditions (1.48) and (1.49), we have 
E( a |b(s,Z)|As 
\Jo
< (ac( 1 + E(Z2)))1 /2 < ж.
In the light of Fubini’s theorem, the integral 0a b(s, Z)As is finite for almost all 
ш, and for such ш, the process /J b(s, Z)As is continuous for t e T. This implies 
that 0a b(s, Z)As is progressively measurable. In the same way, the a.s. continuity 
and progressive measurability of the right-hand side of (1.54) are verified provided 
{x(n+1 )(t) : t e T} is progressively measurable and supseT E (|X(n+1) (s)|2) < ж.

It follows that supteT E (|X(n)(t) |2) < те. This completes the proof. 
□
Lemma 1.6 (see [66]) Let the functions b, B : T x R ^ R satisfy conditions 
(1.48) and (1.49). Then for all t e [u, a]t and for all f e Fu |B(R) such that 
E (f 2 < те, the value Zt(f, ш) is measurable with respect to the a-algebra
A[u,a]T = a{f, W(s) + W(u) : s e [u, a]t},
which is extended by the class of zero measure events.
Proof Using the proof of Theorem 1.41, we obtain that Zt(f, ш) is an a.s. bound of 
the values Z(n (f, ш) as n ^ те, where z\0) (f, ш) = f for t e [u, a]t. If n e N, 
then for t e[u, a]T, we havett
Z(\$,v) = f + 
b(s,Z(n-14f,v))As + 
B(s,Z(-1 )(f,®^4W(s).

Obviously, Zt(0) e A[u,a]T |B(R). By induction and due to Lemma 1.5, we get the 
A[u,a]t-measurability of Ztn) (f, ш) for all n e N. The proof is completed. □
Theorem 1.42 (see [66]) Assume that all conditions of Theorem 1.41 hold. Then 
a solution of the stochastic dynamic equation (1.45) is a Markov process, and its 
transition probability is given by
P(s,Y,t,B) = P({Xs,Y(t) e B}).
Proof It is sufficient to verify that for 0 < u < t < a and any Borel bounded 
function f : R ^ R, we have
E( f(X(t)) | Fu) = E (f(X(t)) | X(u)).
Since Xt(rn) = Zt(Xu(•), ш) a.s., instead of f(X(t)), we consider f (Zt(X(u), ш)). 
Due to Lemma 1.6, the value f(Zt (X(u), ш)) is bounded and A[u,a]T -measurable. 
Therefore, f(Zt(X(u), ш) can be presented as an a.s. bound and as L2(Q, F, P)- 
bound of a linear combination of random variables such that
П = g (X(u)) h 1( W(s 1) - W(u)). ..hm (W(sm) - W(u)),
where the functions g, h 1, • • • ,hm are Borel and bounded, u < s 1 < ... < sm < 
t, m e N. Since X(u) is Fu-measurable and W(s) - W(u) is independent of Fu 
for s > u, we have
E(n|Fu) = g(X(u))E (h 1(W(s 1) - W(u)) • • • hm(W(sm) - W(u)))
and

38
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
E(n|X(u)) = g(X(u))E hi(W(si) - W(u)) • •• hm(W(sm) - W(u))) .
Consequently, passing to the limit, we obtain the required equality
E( f(X(t)) | Fu) = E( f(X(t)) | X(u)).
This completes the proof.

1.3 Shift Operators on Time Scales
In this section, the concept of shift operators on time scales and their basic properties 
will be presented which are necessary to study dynamic equations with shift 
operators on time scales (see [32, 33]).
1.3.1 Shift Operators
Definition 1.20 (see [32, 33]) Let T* be a nonempty subset of the time scale T 
including a fixed number t0 e T* such that there exist operators S± : [10, ю)T x 
T* ^ t* satisfying the following properties:
P.1 The functions S± are strictly increasing with respect to their second argu­
ments, i.e., if
(Tо, t), (Tо, u) e D± := {(s, t) e [t0, ю)t x T* : S±(s, t) e T*},
then
T0 < t < u ^ S±(T0, t) < S±(T0, u).
P.2 If (T1u), (T2, u) e D- with T1 <T2, then
S-(T1 ,u) > S-(T2,u),
and if (T1, u), (T2,u) e D+ with T1 <T2, then
S+(T1 ,u) < S+(T2,u).
P.3 If t e [10, ю)t, then (t, 10) e D+ and S + (t, 10) = t. Moreover, if t e T*, then
(t0, t) e D+ and S+ (t0, t) = t holds.
P.4 If (s, t) e D±, then ss, S±(s, t)^ e D and ST ss, S±(s, t)} = t, respectively.

1.3 Shift Operators on Time Scales
39
P.5 
If (s, t) e D± and (u, S±(s, t)) e DT, then
(s,ST(u,t)) e D±
and
ST(u, S±(s, t)) = S±(s, ST(u, t)),
respectively.
Then the operators S- and S + associated with t0 e T* (called the initial point) are 
said to be backward and forward shift operators on the set T*, respectively. The 
variable s e [10, ж)T in S± (s, t) is called the shift size. The values S + (s, t) and 
S- (s, t) in T* indicate s units translation of the term t e T* to the right and left, 
respectively. The sets D± are the domains of the shift operators S±, respectively.
Now we shall denote by T* the largest subset of the time scale T such that the 
shift operators S± : [10, ж)T x T* ^ T* exist.
Example 1.3.1 Let T = R and t0 = 1. The operators
S-(s,t) =
t/s
st
if t > 0, 
for
if t<0,
s e[1, ^)
(1.55)
and
S+(s, t) =
st
t/s
if t > 0, f for
if t<0,
s e[1, ж)
(1.56)
are backward and forward shift operators (on the set R* = R - {0}) associated with 
the initial point t0 = 1. In the table below, we state different time scales with their 
corresponding shift operators.

Lemma 1.7 (see [32, 33]) Let S- and S+ be the shift operators associated with the 
initial point t0. We have

40
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
(i) S- (t, t) = 10 for all t e [10, ro)T.
(ii) S- (tо,t) = t for all t e T*.
(iii) If (s, t) e D+, then S + (s, t) = u implies S-(s, u) = t. Conversely, if (s, u) e 
D-, then S- (s, u) = t implies S + (s, t) = u.
(iv) 
S + tt, S- (s, 10)) = S- (s, t) for all (s, t) e D+ with t 
10.
(v) 
S + (u, t) = S + (t, u) for all (u, t) e ([10, ro)T x [10, ro)t) A D+.
(vi) 
S + (s, t) e [10, ro)t for all (s, t) e D+ with t 10.
(vii) S- (s, t) e [10, ro)t for all (s, t) e ([10, ro)T x [s, ro)t) A D-.
(viii) If S+(s, •) is Л-differentiable in its second variable, then S + (s, •) > 0.
(ix) 
S + (S- (u, s), S- (s, v^ = S- (u, v) for all (s, v) e ([10, ro)t x [s, ro)t) A D- 
and (u, s') e ([10, ro)T x [u, ro)t) A D-.
(x) If (s, t) e D- and S- (s, t) = 10, then s = t.
Proof
(i) The result follows from P.3—P.5 and that
S - (t, t) = S- tt, S + (t, 10)) = 10 for all t e [10, ro)T.
(ii) From P.3—P.4 and
S-(tо, t) = S-(tо, S + (tо, t)) = t for all t e T*.
Let u := S + (s, t). By P.4 we have (s, u) e D- for all (s, t) e D+, and hence,
S-(s, u) = S- s, S+ (s, t) = t.
The latter part of (iii) can be done in the similar way.
We have (iv) since P.3 and P.5 yield
S +(t, S-(s, tо)) = S-(s, S +(t, tо)) = S-(s, t).
P.3 and P.5 guarantee that
t = S + (t, tо) = S + tt, S-(u, u) = S- {и, S + (t, u)
for all (u, t) e ([tо, ro)t x [tо, ro)t) A D+.
Using (iii) we have
S + (u, t) = S + (и, S- (и, S + (t, u^) = S + (t, u).
This proves (v).
To prove (vi) and (vii), we use P.1—P.2 to get
S + (s, t) 
S + (tо, t) = t

3- (s, s') = 10
for all (s, t) e ([t0, те)t x [s, те)T) П D-.
Since b+ (s, t) is strictly increasing in its second variable, we have (viii) by [63] 
(Corollary 1.16).
(ix) According to P.5 and (v), we have
3 +(3-(u, s), 3-(s, v)) = 3- (s, 3 + (v, 3-(u, s)))
= 3-(s, 3-(u, 3 + (v, s)))

for all (s, v) e ([t0, те)T x [s, те)T) ПD- and (u, s') e ([10, те)T x [u, те)T) П D-.
Suppose (s, t) e D- = {(s, t) e [10, те)T x T* : 3- (s, t) e T*} and 3- (s, t) = 
t0. Then by P.4 we have
t = 3+ (s, 3- (s, t)) = 3+ (s, t0) = s.
This is (x). The proof is completed. 
□
Notice that the shift operators 3± are defined once the initial point t0 e T is 
fixed. For instance, we choose the initial point t0 = 0 to define shift operators 
3± (s, t) = t ± s on T = R. However, if we choose A e (0, те) as the initial point, 
~
then the new shift operators associated with A are defined by 3±(s, t) = t ^ A ± s. 
~
In terms of 3±, the new shift operators 3± can be defined as
3 ± (s,t) = 3 ± (A,3 ± (s,t)).
Example 1.3.2 Some particular time scales with shift operators associated with 
different initial points are provided to show the change in the formula of shift 
operators as the initial point changes, where A e Z+, N1 /2 = {jn : n e N},

1.3.2 Periodicity of Time Scales
In the following, we will state a classical concept of periodic time scales which was 
introduced in [128].
Definition 1.21 (see [128]) A time scale T is said to be periodic if there exists a 
P>0 such that
t ± P e T for all t e T.
(1.57)
If T = R, the smallest positive P is called the period of the time scale.
In this subsection, a new periodicity notion will be presented which does not 
require the time scale to be closed under the operation t ± P for a fixed P>0orto 
be unbounded.
Definition 1.22 (see [32, 33], Periodicity in Shifts) Let T be a time scale with the 
shift operators S± associated with the initial point 10 e T*. The time scale T is said 
to be periodic in shifts S± if there exists a p e (t0, те)T* such that (p, t) e DT for 
all t e T* . Furthermore, if
P := inf{p e (t0, те)t* : (p, t) e DT for all t e T*} = 10, 
(1.58) 
then P is called the period of the time scale T.
A time scale periodic in shifts may be bounded; the following example will be 
presented to show that a time scale, periodic in shifts, does not have to satisfy (1.57).
Example 1.3.3 The following time scales are not periodic in the sense of Def­
inition 1.21 but periodic with respect to the notion of shift operators given in 
Definition 1.22 (see [32, 33]).
(1) T1 = {±n2 : n eZ},
S±(P, t) =
(jt ±^P)2 
if t > 0,

if t = 0,

(2) T2 = qZ,S± (P,t) = P±11, P = q,t0 = 1,

□
Remark 1.9 Let T be a time scale that is periodic in shifts with the period P. 
Through P.4 of Definition 1.20, it follows that the mapping 3 + : T' 
■ T*
defined by 3+P (t) = 3+(P, t) is surjective. On the other hand, we know by P.1 
of Definition 1.20 that shift operators 3± are strictly increasing in their second 
arguments. That is, the mapping 3+P (t) := 3+(P, t) is injective. Hence, 3+P is an 
invertible mapping with the inverse (3+P)-1 = 3-P defined by 3-P (t) := 3- (P, t).
For the next two results, we will present that ifT is a periodic time scale in shifts 
3± with period P, then the operators a± : T* ^ T* are commutative with the 
forward jump operator a : T ^ T given by
a(t) := inf{s e T : s>t}.
That is,
(3± ◦ a) (t) = (a ◦ 3±) (t) for all t e T*.
(1.59)
Lemma 1.8 (see [32, 33]) The mapping 3 + : T* ^ T* preserves the structure of 
the points in T*. That is,
3(t) = t =^ a(3 + (P,?)) = 3 + (P,T).
8(t) >t =^ ^8 + (P,?)) > 3 + (P,T).
Proof From the definition, it follows that a(t ) t for all t e T*. Thus, by P.1
3 + (P,a(t)) > 3 + (P,t).
Since a(3+ (P, t)) is the smallest element satisfying

44
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
ст(3 + (P,t) > 3 + (P,t),
we get
3 + (P,0(t)) > 0(8 + (P,t)) for all t e T*. 
(1.60)
If o(t) =t, then (1.60) implies
8 + (P,-?) = 8 + (P, 0(f)) > 0(8 + (P,?)).
That is,
8+(P, t) = 0 (8+(P, t)) if0(t) = t.
If0(t) > t, then by definition of0,wehave
(T,0(t)) t* = 0 
(1.61)
and by P.1
8 + (P,0(f)) > 8 + (P,-?).
Suppose to the contrary that 8+ (P, t) is right-dense, i.e., 0(8+ (P, t)) = 8+ (P, t).
This along with (1.60) implies
(8 + (P,-t),8 + (P,0(t))) t* = 0.
Pick one element s e (8+(P, t), 8+ (P, 0 (t)))T. Since 8+(P, t) is strictly increasing 
in t and invertible, there should be an element t e (t, 0(t))T such that 8+ (P, t) = s. 
This contradicts (1.61). Hence, 8+(P, t) must be right-scattered, i.e., 0 (8+(P, t)) > 
8 + (P,T). The proof is completed. 
□
Corollary 1.6 (see [32, 33]) The following equalities hold:
8+(P,0(t)) = 0(8+(P, t)) for all t e T*. 
(1.62)
8-(P,0(t)) = 0(8-(P, t)) for all t e T*. 
(1.63)
Proof The equality (1.62) can be obtained similar to the proof of preceding lemma. 
By (1.62) we have
8+(P, 0 (s)) = 0(8+(P, s)) for all s e T*.
Substituting s = 8- (P, t) we obtain

1.3 Shift Operators on Time Scales
45
3 + (P, 0(8-(P, t))) = 0(8 + (P, 8—(P, t))) = 0(t).
This and (iii) of Lemma 1.7 imply
0(8 — (P,t)) = 8 — (P,a(t)) for all t e T*.
This completes the proof.
□
Note that (1.62) along with (1.63) yields (1.59).
Definition 1.23 (see [32, 33], Periodic Function in Shifts 8±) Let T be a time 
scale that is periodic in shifts 8± with the period P. We say that a real-valued 
function f defined on T* is periodic in shifts 8± if there exists a T e [P, ж)T* 
such that
(T,t) e D± and f (8±T (t)) = f(t) for all t e T*, 
(1.64)
where 8±(t) := 8±(T, t). The smallest number T e [P, ж)T* such that (1.64) holds 
is called the period of f.
Example 1.3.4 By Definition 1.22 we know that the real line R is periodic in shifts 
8± defined by (1.55)-(1.56) associated with the initial point 10 = 1. The function
f(t) = sin ( ln |t| ) , t e R* := R — {0} 
ln (1 / 2 )n
is periodic in shifts 8± defined by (1.55)-(1.56) with the period T = 4 since
f(8±(T, t)) =
f(t4±1)
f(t/4±1)

□
Example 1.3.5 The time scale qZ = {qn : n e Z and q > 1} U {0} is periodic in 
shifts 8±(P, t) = P±1t with the period P = q. The function f defined by 
f(t) = (—1) lnq, 
t e q N
(1.65)

46
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
is periodic in shifts S± with the period T = q2 since S + (q2, t) e qZ = qZ and
(
ln t 
In t
s ± (q2 ,t)) = (-1)ln q ±2 = (-1)ln q = f(t)
for all t e qZ. However, f is not periodic in the sense of Definition 1.21 since there 
is no any positive number T such that f (t ± T) = f(t) holds. 
□
Next, we introduce Л-periodic function in shifts.
Definition 1.24 (see [32, 33], Л -Periodic Function in Shifts S±) Let T be a time 
scale that is periodic in shifts S± with period P. We say that a real-valued function 
f defined on T* is Л -periodic in shifts on T if there exists a T e [P, те)T* such 
that
(T,t) e D± for all t e T*,
(1.66)
the shifts S± are Л-differentiable with rd-continuous derivatives, (1.67) 
and
f (ST(t)) S±T(t) = f(t) 
(1.68)
for all t e T*, where S±(t) := S±(T, t). The smallest number T e [P, те)T* such 
that (1.66)-(1.68) hold is called the period of f.
Note that Definitions 1.23 and 1.24 give the classic periodicity definition (i.e., 
Definition 1.21) on time scales whenever S±T (t) = t ± T are the shifts satisfying the 
assumptions of Definitions 1.23 and 1.24.
Example 1.3.6 The real-valued function g(t) = 1/t defined on 2Z ={2n : n e Z} 
is Л-periodic in shifts S±(T, t) = T±11 with the period T = 2 since
f(S±(2, t))SЛ(2, t) = 2±^2±1 = 1 = f(t).

To present the proof of next theorem, the following result is essential:
Theorem 1.43 (Substitution; see [61], Theorem 1.98) Assume: T ^ R is strictly 
^
increasing and T := v(T) is a time scale. If f : T ^ R is an rd-continuousfunction 
and is differentiable with rd-continuous derivative, then for a, b e T,

Theorem 1.44 (see [32,33]) Let T be a time scale that is periodic in shifts 8± with 
period P e [10, rc>)T* and f a Д-periodic function in shifts 8± with the period 
T e [P, rc>)T*. Suppose that f e Crd(T); then

1.4 Combined Dynamic Derivatives on Time Scales
In this section, we will present some necessary knowledge of studying hybrid 
dynamic equations on time scales; the knowledge framework is called the theory 
of combined dynamic derivatives or diamond-a dynamic derivatives on time scales.
1.4.1 Delta and Nabla Derivatives
We denote Tк П Tк by TК.
Definition 1.25 (see [164,165]) We say a time scale T is uniform if for all t e TК, 
p.(t) = n(t). A uniform time scale is an interval if p.(t) = 0 and is a uniform 
difference grid if ^(t) > 0.

Definition 1.26 (see [164, 165]) We say a function f defined on T is right 
continuous at t e T if for all e > 0 there is some 8 > 0 such that for all 
^ e [t, t + 8)t, | f(t) - f(s)| < e. Similarly, we say that f is left continuous 
at t e T if for all e>0 there is some 8>0 such that for all s e (t - 8, t]T, 
|f (t) - f(s)| <e. The function f(t) is said to be continuous if it is both right and 
left continuous.
For the sake of readability of subsequent formulas, we introduce the following 
notation: Let t, s e T and define
to = o(t) - s, 
nts(t) = p(t) — s.
To prove some results in the following, the theorem introduced by Hilger [63] 
will be used, the analogous theorem for the nabla case which can be found in [61].
Theorem 1.45 (see [164, 165]) Assume f : T ^ R is a function and let t e TK. 
Then we have the following:
(i) If f is delta differentiable at t, then f is continuous at t.
(ii) If f is left continuous at t and t is right-scattered, then f is delta differentiable 
at t with
fA(t) = fa(t) — f(t) 
ff(t) — t
(iii) Ift is right-dense, then f is delta differentiable at t iff the limit
lim
s ^ t
f(t) — f(s) 
t — s
exists as a finite number. In this case
fA(t) = lim
s ^ t
f(t) — f(s) 
t — s
Theorem 1.46 (see [164,165]) Assume f : T ^ R is a function and let t e TK. 
Then we have the following:
(i) If f is nabla differentiable at t, then f is continuous at t.
(ii) Iff is right continuous att andt is left-scattered, then f is nabla differentiable 
at t with
fv(t)_ f(t) — fP(t) 
f () t — p(t)
(iii) Ift is left-dense, then f is nabla differentiable at t iff the limit

1.4 Combined Dynamic Derivatives on Time Scales

lim
s ^ t
f(t) - f(s) 
t — s
exists as a finite number. In this case
fv (t) = lim 
s ^ t
f(t) — f(s) 
t — s
Corollary 1.7 (see [164,165]) Assume f : T ^ R is a function and let t e TК. 
The existence of the delta derivative of f at t does not imply the existence of the 
nabla derivative at t, and vice versa.
Proof Consider the function
f(t) =
t sin(1/t), t = 0,
0,t= 0,
on a time scale T = [—2, — 1] U [0, 1]. The function f is continuous at 0, and 
the point 0 e T is right-dense, left-scattered. By Theorem 1.46 (ii), f is nabla 
differentiable at 0. But a finite limit
lim
s ^ t
f(t) — f(s) 
t — s
does not exist at 0. Thus by Theorem 1.45 (iii), f is not delta differentiable at 0. 
To show the existence of the delta derivative does not imply the existence of nabla 
derivative, we may consider the same function f at point 0 on a time scale T = 
[—1, 0] U[1, 2]. 
□
1.4.2 Diamond-a Dynamic Derivative
In this subsection, some necessary knowledge of diamond-a dynamic derivative 
which can unify delta and nabla derivatives will be presented.
Definition 1.27 (see [164,165]) Let T be a time scale. We define f ♦a (t) to be the 
value, if one exists, such that for all e > 0 there is a neighborhood U of t (i.e., 
U = (t — 8,t + 3)t for some 8 > 0) such that for all s e U
|a[fa — f(s)]nts + (1 — a)[fp(t) — f(s)]^ts — f♦ a^tsnts\ < e|^nts|.
We say that f is diamond-a differentiable on T provided f ♦ a(t) exists for all t e 
T К.

Remark 1.10 Note that f ♦ a(t) reduces to fA(t) for a = 1 and fv(t) for a = 0.
Remark 1.11 The function described above is well defined. In fact, let each of ф 1 (t) 
and ф2 (t) be values such that Ve > 0 there exist neighborhoods U 1 and U2 of t such 
that V^ e U 1
|a[f°(t) - f(s)]nts + (1 - a)[fp(t) - f(s)]^ts — Ф1 (t)^tshts\ < e|^tshts|
and Vs e U2
|a[f°(t) - f(s)]nts + (1 — a)[fp(t) - f(s)]^ts — Ф2(t)^tshts\ < e|^tshtsI•
Let e > 0 be given and set e* = e/2. Then Vs e U = U 1 П U2
\ф 1 (t) - Ф2(t)11^tshtsI
= Iф 1 (t)^tshts - ф2(t)^tshts I
= | - a[fa(t) - f(s)]nts - (1 - a)[fp(t) - f(s)]^ts + ф 1 (t)^tsnts

< e*|^ts^tsI + e*|^ts^tsI
= e | ^ts^ts | •
Thus |фi (t) - ф2(t) | < e and letting e ^ 0, then ф1 (t) = ф2(t).
Theorem 1.47 (see [164,165]) Let 0 < a < 1. Iff is both A and V differentiable 
at t e T, then f is ♦ a-differentiable at t and f ♦ a(t) = af A(t) + (1 - a)fv(t)
Proof Assume fA(t) and fv(t) exist. Then Ve > 0, 3 neighborhoods U 1 and U2 
such that for all s e U1
|[ fa(t) - f(s) ] - fA(t)^ts\ < e | ^ts |
and for all s e U2
|[fp(t) - f(s)]- fV(t)^ts\ <e|nts|•
Then for all s e U1
|a[fa(t) - f (s)]nts - af A(t)p.tshts\ < ae|^tshts|

and for all s e U2
|( 1 - a)[fp(t) - f(s)]^ts - (1 - a)fv(t)^tsnts\ < (1 — a)e|^nts|■
(ii) fv exists and
Thus for all s e U = U1 П U2 we have
|a[fa(t) - f(s)]nts + (1 — a)[fp(t) - f(s)]pt, — [afA + (1 - a)fv(t)]MsVts\

< ae|^tsnts| + (1 - a)e|^tsnts| = e|Ptsnts|■
Thus f ♦a exists and f ♦ a(t) = afA(t) + (1 - a)fv(t). This completes the proof.
□
Corollary 1.8 (see [164, 165]) Let t e T be dense. Then if f'(t) exists we have
f ♦ a(t) = fA(t) = fv (t) = f'(t)
Proof Let the point t be dense and f'(t) = limh^0 f(t+h) f(t) exist as a finite 
value. For a sufficiently small neighborhood U of t, Vs, t e U, we may substitute 
h = s - t to see f'(t) = limh^0 f(t+h)-f(t) = lims^t f(t)-f(s). Then by 
Theorem 1.45 (iii), fA(t) = f'(t), and by Theorem 1.46 (iii), fv(t) = f'(t) 
Thus by Theorem 1.47,
f ♦ a(t) = afA(t) + (1 - a)fv(t) = af'(t) + (1 - a)f'(t) = f'(t)
The proof is completed.

Lemma 1.9 (see [164, 165]) Let t e T be scattered. Then f is continuous at t^
Proof Assume t e T is scattered. Then ^(t) > 0 and n(t) > 0. Let 0 < 8 < 
min ^i(t), n(t)\ Then Ve > 0; there is a neighborhood U = (t - 8,t + 8)t of t 
such that Vs e U, s = t and thus | f (t) - f(s) | = 0 < e^

(iii ) f ♦ a (t) — af *(t+) + (1 — a)f—(-)—f (t)

Proof For all neighborhoods U — (t — 8, t + 3)T of t such that 8 < t — p(t), we 
have Vs, t e U, s — t > 0. Thus we can substitute h — s — t in the limit from the 
right and obtain
lim f(t + h) — f(t) = lim f (t) — f(s)

f^(t) — lim f(t) f(s) — f'(t+).

Since f'(t+) exists, (ii) follows from Theorem 1.46 (ii). Then by Theorem 1.47,

The following corollary is immediate similar to the proof of Corollary 1.10:

Theorem 1.48 (see [164, 165]) Let T be a time scale and 0 < a <

1.Iff is
Proof Assume f is ♦a -differentiable at t e T.Ift is a dense or scattered point, 
the result follows from Corollaries 1.8 and 1.9, respectively. It remains to consider 
the two cases where t is right-dense and left-scattered, or t is right-scattered and 
left-dense.
Assume t is right-dense and left-scattered. Thus a(t) — t and p(t) < t.
Let e e (0, 1) and

Since t is left-scattered and right-dense, we have for all s e U 1, p(t) < t < s. Thus

|[f(t) - f(s)]a(p(t) - t)|

Theorem 1.49 (see [164, 165]) Let T be a time scale and 0 < a < 1 . If f is 
♦ a -differentiable at t, then f is both A and V differentiable at t.
Proof Let T be a time scale and 0 < a < 1. Let e > 0 be given, and set 
e* = e|+a > 0. Assume f is оa-differentiable at t e T. Thus by Theorem 1.48, 
f is continuous at t .If t is a dense or scattered point, the result follows from 
Corollaries 1.8 and 1.9, respectively. It remains to consider the two cases where t is 
right-dense and left-scattered, or t is right-scattered and left-dense. Assume t right- 
scattered and left-dense. Thus a(t) > t and p(t) = t. Also, since f is continuous 
at t, by Theorem 1.45 (ii), f is A differentiable at t. Then for all e* > 0, there is a 
neighborhood U1 of t such that for all s e U1
|a[f°(t) - f(s)]nts + (1 - a)[fp(t) - f(s)]pts - f ♦ a(.t)Ptshts\ < e*|ptshts|
and neighborhood U2 of t such that for all s e U2
|[ f°(t') - f (s) ] - f A(t)pts | < e *| pts | ■

Choose y such that f ♦ a(t) = afA(t) + (1 - a)y. Then there exists neighborhood 
U = U1 П U2 of t such that for all s e U
|a[f°(t) - f(s)]nts + (1 — a)[fp(t) - f(s)]nts - a[fa(t) + (1 - a)Y]ntsnts\
= |a[fa(t) - f(s) - fA(t)nts]nts + (1 - a)[fp(t) - f(s) - Ynts]nts\
< e *| ntsnts1 •
Thus
|( 1 - a)[fp(t) - /(s') - Ynts]nts| < entsnts| + |a[fa(t) - f(s') - fA(t)nts]nts\
< e*|nts nts | + ae*|nts nts | = (1 + a)e*|nts nts |•
Then
|[fp(t) - f(s)] - Ynts]| < e*i+a|nts| = e|nts|
Thus fv (t) = y exists.
Similarly, the case for t right-dense and left-scattered can also be obtained. The 
proof is completed. 
□
Remark 1.12 Notice that the strict inequalities in 0 <a < 1 are necessary for the 
results above. In the case a = 1, the ♦a derivative reduces to the A derivative, which 
by Corollary 1.7 does not imply the existence of the v, similar for a = 0.
1.4.3 Some Basic Properties of Combined Dynamic Derivatives
One may consult [61, 63] for a comprehensive development of the calculus of 
the A derivative, and we refer the reader to [63] for an account of the calculus 
corresponding to the v-derivative. A number of useful dynamic derivative relations 
are obtained by Ahlbrandt et al. in the study of the change of variables formulae on 
time scales [29]. Based on existing results and recent investigations in [103-106], 
we may state the following:
Definition 1.28 (see [165, 166]) Let T be a time scale and f(t) be differentiable 
on T in the A and v senses. For t e T we define the diamond-a dynamic derivative 
f ♦ a(t) by
f ♦a = afA(t) + (1 - a)fv(t), 0 < a < 1 •
Thus f is diamond-a differentiable if and only if f is A and v differentiable.

56
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
We may notice that the diamond-a derivative reduces to the standard A derivative 
as a = 1, or the standard V-derivative as a = 0, while it represents a “weighted 
dynamic derivative” for a e (0, 1). Furthermore, the combined dynamic derivative 
offers a centralized derivative formula on any uniformly discrete time scale T 
when a = |. Needless to say, the latter feature is particularly useful in many 
computational applications.

Theorem 1.51 (see [165, 166]) Let f : T ^ R be diamond-a differentiable at 
t e T. Then the following hold:
(i) f♦ aA(t) — afAA(t) + (1 — a)fVA(t).
(ii) f♦aV(t) — afAV(t) + (1 — a)fVV(t).
(iii) fA♦ a(t) — afAA(t) + (1 — a)fAV(t) — f♦ aA(t). 
(iv) fV^a(t) — afVA(t) + (1 — a)fVV(t) — f♦aV(t).

f ♦a ♦ a(t) — a2 f AA(t) + a( 1 — a)(fA V (t) + f V A(t)) + (1 — a)2 fVV (t)
— a2 fAA(t) + (1 — a)2 f VV.
Proof We only need to show (i), (iii), and (v) since proofs of the other identities are 
similar. Following the definition of the diamond-a differentiation, we have
f ♦ aA(t) — (f ♦ a)A(t) — (af A(t) + (1 — a)fV (t))A
— afAA(t) + (1 — a)fA V (t)

59
and this shows (i). By the same token,
fA♦ a(t) = afAA(t) + (1 - a)fAv(t) = f ♦ aA(t)
which ensures (iii). For (v), we observe that
f ♦a♦ a(t) = (afA(t) + (1 - a)f v (t))♦a = a(afA(t) + (1 - a)fv(t))A
+ (1 - a)(afA(t) + (1 - a)fv(t))v

1.4.4 Combined Dynamic Integrations
Definition 1.29 (see [61,63]) Let a, t e T and f : T ^ R. A function F : T ^ R 
is called a A-antiderivative of f provided that FA(t) = f(t) holds for t e T. We 
define the A-integral of f by
f f(T)AT = F(t) - F(a), t e T. 
a
On the other hand, let g : T ^ R. A function G : T ^ R is called a v- 
antiderivative of g provided that Gv (t) = g(t) holds for t e T. We define the 
v integral of g by
g g(T)vт = G(t) - G(a), t e T. 
a
Definition 1.30 (see [165, 166]) Let a,t e T, and h : T ^ R. We define the
♦a -integral ofh as
У h(T)♦ aT = a j h(T)AT + (1 - a) j h(T)vт, t e T, 0 < a < 1.
We may notice that since ♦a -integral is a combined A and A-integral, we in general 
do not have
( f f(T)♦ aT= f (t), t e T.

However, it may be interesting to see basic properties between different dynamic 
derivatives and the оa-integral. As it has been known, the interactions between 
different derivatives and integrals are closely tied to the function compositions 
o(p(t)} and p(a(t) [63]. Since o(p(t) = t at points which are left-dense 
and right-scattered and p(a(t) = t at points which are right-dense and left- 
scattered, we need to consider these points separately in our investigations. For the 
convenience of discussion, we define the following sets:
A := {t e T : t is left-dense and right-scattered},
B :={t e T : t is left-scattered and right-dense},
C := {t e T : t is left-scattered and right-scattered},
D := {t e T : t is left-dense and right-dense}.
The following lemma is a complete version of the similar result in [63]:
Lemma 1.11 (see [165,166]) Let a,t e T. If the left-sided limits of f : T — R 
exist at left-dense points in T, then ft f(r)Ar is V differentiable on T and

Based on the above, we state the following:
Theorem 1.52 (see [165, 166]) Let a, t e T. If the left-sided limits of f : T — R 
exist at left-dense points and the right-sided limits of the function exist at right-dense 
points in T, then ftt f(T)♦ aT is ♦ a-differentiable on T, and

A natural consequence from [104] and the above theorem is the following:
Theorem 1.53 (see [165, 166])
(i) f is diamond-a differentiable with respect to the first variable;
(ii) if the left-sided limits of f exist at left-dense points and the right-sided limits

1.5 Combined Liouville Formula and a-Matrix Exponential 
Solutions
In Theorem 5.28 from [61], Liouville formula of dynamic equations on time scales 
was given by Bohner and Peterson as follows:
Theorem 1.56 (see [61]) Let A e R be a 2 x 2-matrix-valuedfunction and assume 
that X is a solution of ХЛ = A(t)X. Then X satisfiesLiouville formula
det X(t) = etra+Mdet A(t,tо) det X(tо), for t e T. 
(1.70)
In this section, the Liouville formulas for delta, nabla, and a-diamond matrix 
dynamic equations on time scales are given and proved. Meanwhile, the combined 
Liouville formula and a-matrix exponential solutions for combined dynamic equa­
tions are presented.
1.5.1 Liouville Formula for Л-DDynamic Equations
In this subsection, we will discuss the non-eigenvalue form of Liouville formula 
for Л-matrix dynamic equations which will be used to study combined dynamic 
equations on time scales.
Definition 1.31 (see [61]) Define eA(t, t0) by the unique matrix solution of the 
initial value problem:
X\t) = A(t)X(t), Xо = I.

of trA + д det A, i.e., the Liouville formula (1.70) is not suitable for n > 3.

Remark 1.15 Let A be a 2 x 2-matrix-valued function. Then A is regressive iff the 
scalar-valued function trA + v detA is regressive. In fact, let
a11 a12
a21 a22
and then it follows that
det(I + vA) = det
1 + va11 va12 
va21 1 + va22
= (1 + va11)(1 + va22) - va12va21
= 1 + v(a11 + a22) + v2(a11a22 - a12a21) 
= 1 + v(tr A + v det A).
Hence A is regressive iff the scalar-valued function trA + v det A is regressive.
Remark 1.16 Assume that for n = k, we could obtain the similar characterizations 
as in Remark 1.15. For n = k + 1, let
Ak+1 =
Ak 0
0 a0
where Ak+1 is (k +1) x (k+1)-matrix-valued function and Ak is kxk-matrix-valued 
function. Then
det(I + vAk+1) = det Ik + vAk 
0
01+ va0
= (1 + va0) det(I + vAk),

1 + д( tr Ak +1 + д det Ak +1) — 1 + д [tr Ak + a 0 + до 0 det Ak ]
= 1 + дtrAk + доо + до0д det Ak.
Hence, there exists Ak +1 which is regressive, and hence trAk +1 + д det Ak +1 is 
regressive.

1.5.2 Liouville Formula for V-Dynamic Equations and Some 
Lemmas
In this subsection, we will present the Liouville formula for V-dynamic equations 
and some lemmas which will be used to discuss a-diamond dynamic equations.
Lemma 1.15 By Definition 1.31, the matrix function eA(t, t0) is nabla differen­
tiable at t with
eV(t, tо) = A(p(t))(I + v(t)A(p(t))) 1 eA(t, 10)• 
Proof For eA(t, 10) = eA(°(t),tix^eA(t,t0) = A(t)eA(t, 10), we have
V 
eA(t, t0) — eA(p(t),t0)
ev (t, 10) =-----------—------------= A,P(t))eA(p(t), 10)•
On the other hand, by f(t) - f(p(t)) = fv(t)v(t), we obtain
eA(t, 10) - eA(p(t), 10) = v(t)A(p(t))eA(p(t), 10),
that is, eA(t, 10) = (I + v(t)A^p(t)^eA(p(t), 10). Hence

1.5 Combined Liouville Formula and a-Matrix Exponential Solutions
77
ej(t, 10) = A(p(t))(I + v(t)A(p(t))) 1 eA(t, 10).
The proof is completed. 
□
Next, we consider the dynamic equations with nabla derivative.
Lemma 1.16 If A is an upper triangular n x n-matrix-valued function, then A is 
regressive iff each diagonal element of A is regressive.
Proof Let
A=
a11 a12 ... a1n
0 a22 . . . a2n 
00...ann
It follows that
det[I v vA] =
1 — va 11 — va 12 ...
01v va22 ...

n
П(1 — vaii).
i=1
00... 1 — vann
Therefore, A is regressive iff each diagonal element of A is regressive. The proof is 
completed. 
□
Remark 1.17 Let A : T ^ Rn xn be an upper triangular matrix; thus we obtain

det A = J~[ aii, trA = ^aii, det (I — vA) = J~[ (1 — vaii).

of trA + v det A.
It is easy to check the following j-derivative formula of the determinant 
function.

Remark 1.18 Let A be a 2 x 2-matrix-valued function. Then A is regressive iff the 
scalar-valued function trA — v det A is regressive (where tr A denotes the trace of the 
matrix A, i.e., the sum of diagonal elements of A). In fact, let
a11 a12
a21 a22
then it follows that
det(I — vA) = det
1 — va11 —va12 
—va21 1 — va22
= (1 — va11)(1 — va22) — va12va21
= 1 — v(a11 + a22) + v2(a11a22 — a12a21) 
= 1 — v(trA — v det A).
Hence, A is regressive iff the scalar-valued function trA — v det A is regressive.
Remark 1.19 Assume that for n = k, we could obtain the similar characterizations 
as in Remark 1.18. For n = k + 1, let

80

Ak+1 =
Ak 0
0 a0
where Ak +1 is (k +1) x (k +1)-matrix-valued function and Ak is k x k-matrix-valued 
function. Then
det (I - vAk+1) = det Ik — vAk 
0
0 
1 — va 0
= (1 - va 0) det (I — vAk),
1 - v(trAk+1 - v det Ak+1) = 1 - v [trAk + a0 - va0 det Ak] 
= 1 - v trAk - va0 + va0v detAk.
Hence, there exists Ak+1 such that Ak+1 is regressive iff trAk+1 - v det Ak+1 is 
regressive.
Theorem 1.61 (Liouville Formula) Let A e R be n x n matrix-valued matrix

Lemma 1.18 The matrix function e A(t, 10) is delta differentiable at t with
eA(t, 10) = A(o(t))(I - ^(t)A(a(t)))-1 eA(t, 10).
Proof For eJ(t, 10) = eA(t,t0)-eА^У0) = A(t)eA(t, 10), we obtain
eA(t, 10) = eA(a(t),t0)- eA(t,t0) = a(aet))eAeff(t), 10).

On the other hand, by f(<j(t)) - f(t) = fA(t)^(t), we get
eAeaet), 10) - eA(t, 10) = ^(t')A(a(t')}ea(<j(1), 10),
that is, eA(t, 10) = (I - pff)A(a(t))]eA(a(t), 10). Hence
eA(t, 10) = A(ff(t))(I - ^(t)A(a(t))) 1 eA(t, 10).
The proof is completed.

1.5.3 Liouville Formula for Diamond-a Dynamic Equations
In the sequel, we will introduce the a-matrix exponential function and obtain the 
Liouville formula for diamond-a dynamic equations. Several examples are provided 
on various time scales.
Definition 1.33 (see [165]) Let T be a time scale and f be differentiable on T in 
the A and V sense. For t e T we define the diamond-a dynamic derivative f ♦ a(t) 
by
f ♦ a(t) = afA(t) + (1 - a)fV(t), 0 < a < 1.
Thus f is diamond-a differentiable if and only if f is A and V differentiable.
Definition 1.34 (see [139]) Let f (•) : T ^ R; we define the generalized diamond­
exponential function by
ef(t, 10) = aef (t, 10) + (1 - a)ef(t, 10), 0 < a < 1.
Theorem 1.63 The generalized diamond-exponential function is the solution of the 
diamond a-dynamic equation

where 0 < a < 1 with the initial condition x(t0) = 1. When a = 1, the dynamic 
equation is Л-dynamic equation, and when a = 0, the dynamic equation is V- 
dynamic equation.
Proof By Definitions 1.33 and 1.34, we obtain
(e f(t, t о ) )♦ a(t) = a(aef(t, tо ) + (1 — a)e Л (t, tо )
aef(t, tо) + (1 — a)eV(t, tо)

Hence, the generalized diamond-a exponential function eft, 10) is the solution of 
(1.74). Further when a = 1, we obtain the dynamic equation (1.74) as follows:
x ♦ (t) = хл(() = f(t)ef(t,tо ), 
(1.75)
in the solution of (1.75) x = ef(t, 10), (1.75) can be written as хл(() = f (t)x(t). 
Similarly, we also have the case for a = 0. The proof is completed.

Hence, we have the solutions of (1.78) and (1.79) with the initial value f (t0) = 1

for any 0 < a < 1, thus fV(t) + fp(t)f(t) = fA(t) + f(t)fa(t) = 0; then we 
have
fV(t) = — fp(t)f(t), fA(t) = — f(t)fa(t),
i.e., f (t) with f (t0) = 1 is a solution of (1.76). The proof is completed.

Next, we consider the diamond a-dynamic equations on time scale as follows:
X♦a = (aA(t) + (1 — a)Ap(t)(I + v(t)Ap(t)) 1)aeA(t, tо)
+ (aA° (t) (1 — ^(t)A<x (t))
+ (1 — a)A(t))(1 — a)eA(t,tо), 0 < a < 1, 
(1.80)
where A : T ^ Rnxn, eA(t, 10) is solution of (1.71), and <?A(t, 10) is the solution of 
(1.73) with the initial value
X(t0) = X0 e Rn x n

Definition 1.35 Let T be a time scale and A(•) : T ^ Rnxn be Л and V 
differentiable on T. For t e T we define the diamond-a dynamic derivative A♦ a(t) 
as
A♦ a(t) = aA\t) + (1 - a)AV(t), 0 < a < 1.
Obviously, A(t) is diamond-a differentiable if and only if A(t) is Л and V 
differentiable.
Definition 1.36 Let A(•) : T ^ Rnxn; we define the generalized diamond matrix 
exponential function (i.e., a-matrix exponential function) by
eA(t, tо) = aeA(t, 10) + (1 - a)eA(t, 10), 0 < a < 1.
Remark 1.20 For the diamond a-dynamic equation (1.80), if a = 1, then (1.80) 
becomes (1.71); if a = 0, then (1.80) becomes (1.73).
Theorem 1.65 The generalized a-matrix exponential function eA(t,t0) is the 
solution of (1.80).
Proof Since
(eA(t, tо))♦a = a(aeA(t, tо) + (1 - a)efa, tо))
+(1 — a) (aeV(t, tо) + (1 — a)eV(t, tо)),
by Lemmas 1.15 and 1.18, it follows that
(eA(t, 10))♦a = a[aA(t)eA(t, tо) + (1 - a)A(c(t))(I - ^(t)A(c(t)))-1 eA(t, tо)]
+ (1 - a) [ A (P(t) )(I + v(t)A (P(t) )) eA(t, t 0 ) + (1 - a)Ae A(t, t 0 ) ]
= [aA(t) + (1 - a)A(p(t))(I + v(t)A(p(t)))-1]aeA(t, tо)
+ [aA(a(t))(I - p{t)A(a{t))) 
+ (1 - a)A(t)](1 - a)eA(t, tо).
The proof is completed. 
□
Theorem 1.66 Let A( •) : T ^ R n x n; then the diamond a-dynamic equation (1.80) 
can be written as
X♦a = A(t)X(t), 0 < a < 1,
iff A(t ) satisfies

93
A(t) = e - A.(t,tо ). 
(1.81)
Proof If A(t) is solution of the equation A(t) = e-A(t, 10), then
aA(t) + (1 - a)A(p(t))(I + v(t)A(p(t))) 1
= A(t) + (1 - a)(A(p(t)) - A(t) - v(t)A(t)A(p(t)))(I + v(t)A(p(t)))-1
= A(t) - v(t)( 1 - a)(Av(t) + A(t)A(p(t)))(I + v(t)A(p(t)))-1,
aA (a(t))(I - j(t)A(a(t))) 1 + (1 - a)A(t)
= a(-j(t))-1 (-j(t)')Aa(t)(I - j(t)Aa(t))-1 + (1 - a)A(t)
= a(-j(t))-1( - I + I - p.(t)Ao(t))(I - j(t)A°(t))-1 + (1 - a)A(t)
= a(-j(tf) 1[ - I(I - ^(t)A<J(t)) + (I - pili/A(t))(I - pili/A(t)) ]
+(1 - a)A(t)
= a(-j(tf) 1[(I - piii/A(t)) (-Г) + (I - р(Ш\п(t)) (I - ц(1)Аа(t))]
+(1 - a)A(t)
= a(-^(t))-1(I - ^(t)Ar(t))-1 (-^(t))Ar(t) + (1 - a)A(t)
= a(I - ^(t)Aa(t))-1(Aa(t) - A(t) + ^(t)^a(t)A(t)) + A(t)
= a^(t)(I - ^(t')Ar(t'))-1(AA(t) + Aa(t)A(t)) + A(t).
On the other hand, for A(t) = e- A (t, 10), we obtain
AA(t) = - Aa(t)e - A°(t,t 0) = - Aa(t)A(t),
A v (t) = - Aa(p(t))e - A°(p(t),t0) = - A(t)Ap(t).
Hence the dynamic equation (1.80) becomes
X♦a = A(t)X(t), 0 < a < 1.
If the diamond a -dynamic equation (1.80) can be given as
X♦a = A(t)X(t), 0 < a < 1, 
then
aA(t) + (1- a)Ap(t) (I + v(t)Ap(t) )-1 = aA°(t) (I - /jft)Aa (t) )-1 + (1 - a)A(t).

94

Hence
(1 - a)v(t)(Av(t) + A(t)Ap(t))(I + v(t)Ap(t))-1
= a^(t)(Aa + Aa(t)A(t))(I - p(t)Aa(t))-1
for any 0 < a < 1. Therefore,
Av (t) + A(t)Ap(t) = Aa + Aa(t)A(t) = 0,
and thus A(t) = e- A (t, 10). The proof is completed.

Theorem 1.67 (Liouville Formula) Let A(•) : T ^ Rnxn, X be a solution of 
(1.80); then X satisfies Liouville formula
detX(t) = det (aX 1 + (1 - a)X2) detX0, for t e T,
where X 1 is solution of XA = A(t)X(t) and X2 is solution of Xv = A(t)X(t).
Proof By Theorem 1.65, we obtain aX1 + (1 - a)X2 is a solution of (1.80). Hence
det X(t) = det (aX 1 + (1 - a)X2) det X0, for t e T.
The proof is completed.

In fact, ^(t) = v(t) = 0 for any t e T, so XA(t) = Xv(t) = XTherefore,

1.6 Quaternion Combined Impulsive Matrix Dynamic 
Equation on Time Scales
In 1843, Hamilton initiated the notion of quaternions which extends the complex 
numbers to the four-dimensional space (see [12о]). The multiplication of quater­
nions is determined by a noncommutative division algebra. Let q = q0+q 1 i + q2 j + 
q3k be a quaternion, where q0, q 1, q2, q3 e R, and i, j, k satisfy the multiplication: 
i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = -1,jk =-kj = i, ki =-ik = j, ij =-ji = k. In 
the real world, there exists the quaternionic differential equation structure in many 
research fields such as differential geometry, fluid mechanics, attitude dynamics, 
quantum mechanics (see [1]), etc., and many researchers focus on the subject with 
quaternionic background (see [71, 81, 133, 140, 142, 206-209, 213, 219]).
In this section, we will establish some works on the combined matrix dynamic 
equations on time scales under quaternionic background. Moreover, the dynamic 
equations with impulses demonstrate their advantages in describing the dynamic 
behavior with a sudden change or an impact; it is significant to investigate the 
impulsive dynamic equations on hybrid domains (see [172-176, 179, 182-184, 187, 
194]). Since impulsive dynamic equations play a vital role in depicting the natural 
phenomena with sudden changes in the practical applications (see [137, 162]), 

98
1 Riemann Integration, Stochastic Calculus, and Shift Operators on Time Scales
we will introduce a quaternion matrix combined-exponential function and study 
its properties. Based on it, a class of quaternion matrix dynamic equation with 
combined derivatives and bi-directional impulses is introduced and investigated; 
some basic results including the fundamental solution matrix and corresponding 
Cauchy matrix are obtained.
In what follows, we will present some fundamental knowledge of combined cal­
culus on time scales and generalize these results under the quaternion background. 
For convenience, we denote quaternion space by Q throughout this section.

(ii) уbf(t)At = - уa f(t)At;
(iii) уc f (t)At = уb f(t)At + уc f(t)At;
(iv) |Уbf(t)At | < Уb | f(t) |At.

Definition 1.39 (see [139]) Let A : T ^ Qn Xn be differentiable on T in Л and V 
sense. For t e T, define a diamond-a dynamic derivative A♦ a(t) by
A♦ a(t) = aA^t) + (1 - a)AV(t), 0 < a < 1.
Thus A(t) is diamond-a differentiable if and only if A(t) is Л and V differentiable.
Consider the following two initial value problems of homogeneous quaternion 
matrix dynamic equations on time scales.
XV(t) = A(t)X(t), X(t0) = I, 
(1.82)
ХЛ(Г) = A(t)X(t), X(tо) = I, 
(1.83)
where I is an identity matrix.
Now, we will derive a quaternion matrix V-exponential function eA(t,t0) by 
calculating the solutions of the initial value problems of the quaternion matrix V- 
dynamic equation (1.82). Similarly, a quaternion matrix Л-exponential function 
eA(t, t0) can also be obtained.
Theorem 1.70 The quaternion matrix exponential function e A(t, 10) is given by
eA(t,tо) = I +

1.6.2 Quaternion Matrix Diamond-Exponential Function and 
Quaternion Combined Matrix Dynamic Equation
In the sequel, we will introduce a definition of quaternion matrix diamond­
exponential function through matrix exponential functions introduced in Theo­
rem 1.70. For convenience, we introduce some notations, eA p(t), t0 := eAp (t, t0), 
A(p(t)) = Ap(t), eA(a(t), 10) := e^(t, 10), A(a(t)) = A'"(t); so does e.
Definition 1.40 Let A : T ^ Qnxn, where n e Z+; we define a quaternion matrix 
diamond-exponential function by eA = aeA(t, 10) + (1 - a)eA(t, 10).
Lemma 1.19 eJ(t, 10) = Ap(t)(I + v(t)AP(t)) 1 eA(t, 10) if I + v(t)AP(t) is 
invertible.
Proof By Theorem 1.70, we have

On the other hand, since
eA(t,t 0) = ep(t,t0) + v(t)ep (t,t0) = (I + v(t)A(p(t))) eA (p(t),t 0), 
then eA(p(t), 10) = (I + v(t)A(p(t))) 1 eA(t, 10). Therefore,
eA (t, 10) = Ap(t) (I + v(t)Ap(t))—1 eA(t, 10).

On the other hand, since
eA(t, 10) = eA(t, 10) + ^(t)e^(t, 10),
then eA(t, 10) = (I — ^(t)Aa(t)) 1 eA(t, 10). Therefore,
eA(t, 10) = Aa(t)(I — ^(t)Aa(t)) — 1 eA(t, 10).
The proof is completed.

Remark 1.21 Note that the quaternion combined matrix dynamic equation (1.85) 
becomes (1.82) for a = 0; moreover, it becomes (1.83) for a = 1.
Theorem 1.71 eA(t,t0) is the matrix exponential solution of the initial value 
problem of (1.85).
Proof By Theorem 1.70, Lemma 1.19, and Definition 1.39, we obtain

e^a(t, tо) = (aAa(t)(I - ^t)A°(t))-1 + (1 - a)A(t))eA(t, 1о).

(1.92)
Remark 1.23 For the impulsive term (1.92), ♦ X(t) = X(t+) — X(t) for the right- 
dense point ts (s > 0); ♦ X(t) = XL (a(t) — XL(t) for the right-scattered point ts 
(s > 0). Similarly, ♦ X(t) = X(t—) — X(t) for the left-dense point ts (s < 0); 
<♦ XX(t) = XL(p(t}) — X(t) for the left-scattered point ts (s < 0).
Theorem 1.75 For the quaternion impulsive matrix dynamic equation (1.91), if 
there exists finite number of points ts in any compact interval [a, b]T with a<b, 
and the matrices I + Bs are non-singular for all s e Z, then a fundamental solution

Chapter 2
♦ a-Measurability and Combined
Measure Theory on Time Scales
In this chapter, combined measure theory on time scales is established including ♦ a - 
measurability, ♦ a-measurable functions, Lebesgue-Stieltjes combined ♦ a-measure, 
and related integrals. In Sects. 2.1-2.3, concept of ♦ a-measurability is introduced 
and combined measure theory on time scales is presented. Particularly, A-measure 
theory and V-measure theory can be unified by this combined theory. Moreover, 
some criteria for ♦ a-measurability of a set are established, and the notion of 
Lebesgue ♦ a-measurable functions is introduced and investigated. In Sects. 2.4-2.5, 
concepts of Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦ a -measure, ♦ a-measurable function, and ♦ a - 
integral are introduced. Based on theory of combined measurability on time scales, 
some basic properties including the relations, the extensions, and the composition 
theorems are established. Particularly, through the switch coefficient a of the 
combined theory, one can obtain Lebesgue-Stieltjes A-measure and Lebesgue- 
Stieltjes V-measure by taking a = 1 and a = 0, respectively. In addition, several 
examples are provided to demonstrate these results in each section.
2.1 Lebesgue Measurable and Lebesgue ♦ a-Measurable Sets
We will introduce the following two definitions which will be used to prove some 
basic theorems and lemmas in the later sections.

istic function like S = ^2 aiXA is called a simple function, where Ai are pairwise 
disjoint sets with Ai = {t : S(t) = ai}, i = 1, 2, ...,n.
Definition 2.2 (See [160]) Assume f(t) is defined on E c T, and let
f+(t) = max{0,f(t)} =
f-(t) =-min{0,f(t)}=

iff(t) < 0, 
and 
- f(t), if f(t) < 0,
0, iff(t) > 0, 
called the positive and negative part of f, respectively.
In the following section, we shall establish a criterion for ♦a -measurability 
of sets and show the relation between Lebesgue ♦ a-measure ц.♦ a and Lebesgue 
measure L *.
2.1.1 ♦ a-Measure
Definition 2.3 (See [158]) Let T be a time scale, a and p be the jump operators 
defined in Sect. 1.1, and a combined interval (or a-interval) be
[a, b]a :=
(a, b]T, 
(a, b)T, 
[a, b)T,
a= 0, 
0<a< 1, 
a= 1,
where (a, b]T = {t e T : a < t < b, a,b e T}, (a, b)T ={t e T :a<t < 
b, a,b e T}, [a, b)t = {t e T : a < t <b, a,b e T}. Let K be the family of all 
combined intervals.
Then we present the set function m♦ a corresponding to [a, b]a as
m♦ a ([a, b]“) =
b - a, 
a = 0,
a b - a(a) + (1 - a) p(b) - a ,ae (0, 1), 
b - a, 
a = 1.
For a = b, we denote that [a, b]a = 0, and m♦ a ([a, b]a) = 0.

2.1 Lebesgue Measurable and Lebesgue ♦ a-Measurable Sets
119
Remark 2.1 If a e (0, 1), the a -interval [ a, b ]a turns into (a, b), and we can see
m♦ J(a,b)T) = lim m♦ a ([a, b]“) = P(b) - a, 
a ^0+
m♦ J(a,b)t) = lim m♦ a ([a, b]a) = b - o(a). 
a ^1
Definition 2.4 Let E c T. If there exists at least one finite or countable system 
of intervals [an, bn]a e K(n = 1, 2,...) such that E c UneN0[an, bn]a, then we 
call m♦ (E) = inf22neN0 m♦ a([an, bn]a) the outer ♦ a-measure of E, where the 
infimum is taken over all coverings of E by a finite or countable system of intervals 
[an, bn]a e K. If there is no such covering of E, we say m♦ (E) = те.
Remark 2.2 From the above definition, one can obtain that the outer m ♦ a -measure 
is equal to the outer V-measure when a = 0 and is equal to the outer A-measure 
when a = 1, and if a e (0, 1), it is a linear combination of outer V-measure and 
outer A-measure, so for [a, b]a e K we can get
m♦ a ([a, b]a) = amA([a, b]a) + (1 - a)mV([a, b]a),
where a e [0, 1]. Hence, let E c T; for a = 0, if min T e E, then m♦ a(E) = те; 
if a = 1, maxT e E, then m♦ a(E) = те; if a e (0, 1), and minT e E or 
maxT e E or {minT, maxT} c E, then m♦ a(E) = те.
Definition 2.5 We say a property holds everywhere except for a null set is ♦a - 
almost everywhere, briefly ♦a-a.e. in combined measure theory on time scales.
Theorem 2.1 Let A c T, B c T and m ♦ (A), m♦ (B) be the outer ♦ a-measure 
of A and B , respectively. Then
(1) m♦ (A) > 0; if A = 0, then m ♦ (E) = 0;
(2) let A c B; then m♦*(A) < m♦(B);
(3) m♦ (U“1 Ai) 
“1 m♦ (A)).
♦a =

Proof
(1) This is clear from the definition of m 1 .

(2) Let A c B, and for an arbitrary system of intervals {Ija}jeN0, Ija e K such that 
B c UjeN0 j, then A c UjeN0 j, and hence m♦ a(A) < EjeN0 m♦ а(1Р, 
and taking the infimum for all system of intervals {Ija}jeN0 , then

Proposition 2.1 If E is a ♦ --measurable set, then for any set P c T
m♦ a(P) = m♦ a(P n E> + m♦ «(P П E")
holds whether P is ♦ a-measurable or not.
Proof Let E c T and E is ♦ «-measurable, P is an arbitrary subset of T, and

Because of the arbitrariness of e, we have

On the other hand, from Theorem 2.1, we have
m♦ «(P П E) + m♦ «(P П E3) > m♦ «(P).
Therefore,
m* (P П E) + m* (P П E3) = m* (P).

This completes the proof. 
□
Remark 2.3 T is ♦«-measurable since T is a subset of itself, and for any P c T, 
P n T = P and P n T3 = 0. Hence, m* (P) = m^ (P n T) + m^ (P n T3).

Now the Lebesgue ♦ a -measure denoted by д♦ a is m ♦ restricted to N (m♦ ) 
and it is a countably additive measure.
Proposition 2.2 Let {Ei} be an increasing sequence of ♦ a -measurable set in T, 
such that E 1 c E 2 c • • • C En c • • •. If E = |J ^=1 Ei = limn ^ж En, then we 
have
Д ♦ a(E) = n Km, Д ♦ a(En).
If {En} is a decreasing sequence of ♦ a-measurable set in T such that E 1 d E2 d
• • • D En D • • •, and E = Q Ж1 Ei = limn ^ж En, then for д ♦ a(E 1) < ж, we 
have
Д ♦ a(E) = n Km, Д ♦ a(En).
Proof Let En e N(m♦ ) and {En} be a nondecreasing sequence of sets; then 
we have E e N(m♦). We may assume that д♦ a(En) < ж for all n, since if 
Д♦ a(Ej) = ж for some j, д♦ a(En) = ж for all n j, д♦ „(Un=1 En) = ж. 
Thus
U En = E1 U (EC П E2) U ■■■ U (EC_1) U ■■■

i.e., Un=1 En can be rewritten as a union of some disjoint sets; from Theorem 2.3, 
we get

For « = 0 and min T e E, or for « = 1 and max T e E, or for « e (0, 1) and 
min T e E (or max T e E or {max T, min T} c E), in these cases, m♦ (E) = o 
since we cannot find intervals Ij e K (j = 1, 2,...) such that E c X>=i Ij; then 
the equality (2.2) holds.
Now let E c T - {min T, max T} and 10 e E; then

m♦ a (E) < m♦ a E П {t0}) + m♦ a (E П {t0}^

Now suppose that t0 e [cj0, dj0]a for some j0 e N0, and then we have the following

(i) if a = 0, for interval (cj0, dj0]T, we rewrite it as j0, djJT = j0, t0]T U 
(tо, ((tо)]T U (attо), djJT.
(ii) If a = 1, for interval [cj0, dj0)T, we rewrite it as [cj0, dj0)T = [cj0, p(t0))T U

(iii) Ifa s (0, 1), for interval (cj0, dj0)T, we consider
(a) If t0 is an isolated point, we rewrite it as (cj0, dj0)T = (ptt0), ( (t0) T.
(b) Ift0 is a dense point, we rewrite it as (cj0, dj0)T = (cj0, t0)T U (t0-e1,t0+ 
e1 )T U (t0 ,dj0 )T, where e1 > 0 is a sufficiently small number.
(c) If t0 is left-dense and right-scattered, we rewrite it as (cj0 ,dj0)T = 
(cj0 , t0)T U t0 - e2, ( (t0) T, where e2 > 0 is a sufficiently small number.
(d) If t0 is left-scattered and right-dense, we rewrite it as (cj0 ,dj0)T = 
(p(t0), t0 + e3)T U (t0, dj0)T, where e3 > 0 is a sufficiently small number.
For the above four cases, we denote the intervals (p(t0), t0]T, [t0, ((t0))T, (t0 -

Theorem 2.4 ♦ a-measure of a single-point set {p 0} c T - {min T, max T} is given 
by
d♦ a ({p00 = a(°(p0) - po) - (1 - a)(p0 - p(p0O, 
(2.3) 
where a and p are defined in Definition 2.3.
Proof
(i) If p0 is left-scattered and right-scattered, then for a = 0 and a = 1, 
we consider {p0} = )p(p00),po]T e K and {p0} = [p0,a(p0))T e K,
respectively. Then when a = 0 we have
d♦ a ({p0}) = m♦ A(p(p0), po]t) = p0 - P(p0).
Also if a = 1, then
d♦ a ({p0}) = m♦ a ([p0, a (p0))t) = a(p0) - p0.
If a e (0, 1), we have {p0} = (p(t0),a(t0))T; then
d ♦ a( {p 0}) = m ♦ a((p(p 0 ),a(p 0)) t)
=a a(p0) - a(p (p0)) + (1 - a) p(a (p0)) - p(p0)
=a a(p0) - p0 + (1 - a) p0 - p(p0) .
(ii) if p0 is left-dense and right-dense, and for a = 0 there is a sequence of sets 
{pk} (pk e T) such that (p 1, p0]T D (p2, p0]T D • • • and pk ^ p0, p0 = 
й*=1 (pk, po]t. Also for a = 1, we consider [p0, p 1)T D [p0, p2)T D • • •, 
then if a e (0, 1), we consider (c 1 ,d 1)T D (c2,d2)T D •••, where p0 e 
(ci, di)T and limi^TO ci = p0, limi^TO di = p0, then from Proposition 
we 
get
2.2 
d ♦ a( { p 0} )
limk.,, d♦ a ((pk, p0]T) = p0 - pk = 0, if a = 0.
lim d♦ a([p0, pk)T) = pk - p0 = 0, if a = 1.
k ^TO
lim d♦ a((ci, di)T) = a(di - a(ci)) + (1 - a)(p(di) - ci) = 0, 
i ^to
ifa e (0, 1),
so Eq. (2.3) also holds for this case.
(iii) If p0 is left-scattered and right-dense, and for a = 0, similar to (i), we have

2.1 Lebesgue Measurable and Lebesgue ♦ a-Measurable Sets
129
V♦ a({P0}) = P0 — P(P0^
Also for a = 1, we use the way given by (ii); then д♦ a ({p0}) = 0•
For a e (0, 1), we consider the interval (ppp0), a(pk)}T, k e N0, pk e T, 
and pk ^ p0; it follows from {p0} = QkeN0 (p&0), a(pk)T that
д♦ a({p0}) = lim д♦ a(p(p0),&(pk)) = lim a(v(pk) — &(p(p0))) 
k~ю 
k^ю
+ lim (1 - a) (p(a(pk)) — p(p0)) 
k ^ю
=(1 - a) p0 - p(p0) •
(iv) If p0 is left-dense and right-scattered, similar to (iii), and we get
0,
a = 0 •
Д ♦ a( { p 0} ) =
a(&(p0) - p0), a e (0, 1 )• 
&(.p 0) — p 0, 
a = 1 •
From the above four cases, we finally obtain
m♦ a({p0}) = a(&(p0) — p0) + (1 — a)(p0 - p(p0^.
Then proof is completed. 
□
Remark2.4 From Theorem 2.4, if a = 0, then д♦ a({p0}) = дv({p0}) = p0 — 
p(p0), and if a = 1, then д♦ a({p0}) = дд({p0}) = a(p0) — p0.
Lemma 2.4 (see [69]) The set of all right-scattered points of T denoted by SR is at 
most countable, that is, there are I c N and {ti} ieI c T such that
{t e T : t < a(t)} = {ti} i e I.
Remark 2.5 We denote the set of all left-scattered points of T by SL , and the set of 
all left-dense points ofT by DL, the set of all right-scattered points ofT by SR, and 
the set of all right-dense points ofTby DR; then SL and SR are countable according 
to [69].
Remark 2.6 In what follows, we will denote the extensions of a set E c T by E♦1

where IE denotes the indices set of right-scattered points of E and JE denotes the 
indices set of left-scattered points of E.
Corollary 2.2 The sets SR, DR, SL, and DL introduced in Lemma 2.4 and 
Remark 2.5 are ♦ a-measurable.
Proof Since SR is a countable union of single-point sets, it is ♦ a-measurable. Con­
sequently, DR is ♦ a-measurable because of the difference of two ♦ a-measurable 
sets T and SR. For SL and DL, we can get the result in the similar way. 
□
We have proved that a single-point subset of T is ♦ a -measurable in the first step 
in order to show all types of intervals are also ♦ a-measurable. We will use the fact 
that by adding or subtracting point a or b to [a, b]a which is ♦ a-measurable to 
obtain that other types of intervals are ♦ a-measurable.
Theorem 2.5 If a, b e T — {min T, max T} and a <b, then
(i) д♦ a ((a, b)t) = a(b — a(a)) + (1 — a){p(b) — a).
(ii) д♦ a ((a, b]t) = a(a(b") — a(a)) + (1 — a)(b — a).
(iii) д ♦ a ([ a, b) t) = a(b — a) + (1 — a)[p(b) — p(a)).
(iv) д♦ a ([a, b]t) = a(a(b) — a) + (1 — a)(b — p(a).
Proof
(i) Firstly, if a = 0, from the definition of д♦ a, we have д♦ ((a, b]t) = b — a, 
and
Д♦ A(a, b)t) = Д♦Д(a, b]t) — Д♦о({b}) = b — a — (b — P(b) = P(b) — a.
If a = 1, we get д([a, b)t) = b — a; then д♦Д(a, b)t) = д♦Д[a, b)t) — 
Д♦1 ({a}) = b — c(a). If a e (0, 1), then д♦ a((a, b)t) = a(b — a(a)) + (1 — 
a)(p(b) — a).
(ii) Because (a, b]t = (a, b)T U {b} and (a, b)T and {b} are ♦ a-measurable, so is 
(a, b]T. Then
д♦ A(a, b]t) = д♦ a((a, b)t) + д♦ a({b})
=O^b — ff(a) + (1 — a)(^p(b) — a + Oo(b) — b)
+ (1 — a) (b — p(b))
=O^a(b) — a(a) + (1 — a)(b — a).
(iii) Similarly, since [a, b)T = (a, b)T U{a }, then
д♦ a ([a,b)t) = д♦ A.(a,b)t) + д♦ a({a})
= Ob — a(a) + (1 — a)(^p(b) — 
+ O^a(a) — a)

2.1 Lebesgue Measurable and Lebesgue ♦ a-Measurable Sets
131
+ (1 — a) (a — p(a)
= a(b — a) + (1 — a)(p(b) — p(a).
(iv) Since [a, b]T = [a, b)T U {b}, then
b♦ a ([a, b]T) = b♦ a ([a, b)T) + b♦ a ({b})
= a(b — a) + (1 — a)(p(b) — p(a) + a(a(b) — b)
+ (1 — a) (b — p(b))
= a(a(b) — a + (1 — a)(b — p(a).
This completes the proof. 
□
Remark 2.7 Notice that b♦ a = bV when a = 0, and b♦ a = Ьл when a = 1, and 
if a e (0, 1), b♦ a is a linear combination of bV and ьл . So for any interval E c T, 
we obtain
b♦ a(E) = a^(E) + (1 — a)bv(E), a e [0, 1].
2.1.2 Lebesgue Measurable and Lebesgue ♦ a-Measurable Sets
In this subsection, we will compare two outer measures, Lebesgue outer measure L* 
defined on R and outer measure m ♦ defined on T. We denote the usual Lebesgue 
measure on R by L and the corresponding outer measure by L*, i.e.,
L*(E) = inf

From the above we can easily see that the set of all left-scattered points of T is 
also countable; then the set of all isolated points is countable. For the convenience 
of discussion, we define the following sets:
A := {t e T : t is left-dense and right-scattered},
B := {t e T : t is left-scattered and right-dense},
C := {t e T : t is left-scattered and right-scattered},
D := {t e T : t is left-dense and right-dense}.

then we have that every interval [ai ,bi]a which may arise in the definition 
of m♦ (E) is also among intervals (ai, fii) which appear in the definition of 
L*(E). So the infimum defined by L*(E) is surely less than or equal to the one 
defined by m♦ (E); thus L* (E) < m(E) is proved.
(b) If E has no scattered points, then for any point t £ E, we have a(t) = t, p(t) =

i.e., m♦ a([a, b]a) = b - a if E is not a closed interval. If E is a closed interval, 
then we assume that E = [c, d] = [c, d) U {d}, c < d, from Theorems 2.4 
and 2.5; then m♦ (E) = d - c. Also we know that L* ([c, d]) = L*((c, d)) = 
L* ((c, d]) = L*([c, d)) = d - c, i.e., m♦ (E) = L*(E).
(c) Let tk e T - {max T, min T}. Then {tk} c [tk - s,tk + e] holds for each s > 0 
and so
L*({tk}) c L*([tk -s,tk+s]) =2s
and since s is arbitrary, L* ({tk}) = 0, which implies {tk} is Lebesgue 
measurable with measure zero. Since the set of all right-scattered points of any 
time scale is at most countable, then
L( U {tk 0 = E

L({tk}) = 0,
i.e., L* (A) = 0, so it implies L* (B) = L* (C) = 0. Hence, we can get (2.6) 
directly from Theorems 2.3 and 2.4.
(d) Suppose that E c T -{max T, min T}. Since E П A, E П B, E П C are Lebesgue

given by (

2.6
L*(E) = L* (E П A) + L* (E П B) + L*(E П C) + L*(E П D).
Furthermore, E П A c A and L* (A) = 0, we obtain L* (E П A) = 0, then we 
also get L* (E П B) = L* (E П C) = 0, and finally we get L*(E) = L* (E П D).

then we have
L*(P) < L*(P П E) + L*(P П ((T\E) U (R\T)))
< L*(P П E) + L*(P П (T\E)) + L*(P П (R\T)),
since P n (R\T) = 0, it implies L* (P n (R\T)) = 0, then
L*(P) < L*(P П E) + L*(P П (T\E)),

Hence, from (2.7) and (2.8), we obtain
L*(P) = L*(P n E) + L*(P n (R\E)),
which implies E is Lebesgue measurable.
(b) Let E c T — {max T, min T} and т0 be the minimum point of T and т 1 be the 
maximum point of T; then if a = 0, and P contains the minimum point т0 of 
T, we have
L*(P) < L*(P n E) + L*(P n (R\E)). 
(2.9)
Let P = M U {т0}; (2.9) becomes
L* (P) < L* ((M U {т0}) n E) + L* ((M U {т0}) n (R\E))
< L* (M n E) + L* ({т0} n E) + L* (M n (R\E)) + L* ({т0} n (R\E))
< L* (M n E) + L* (M n (R\E)) + L* ({т0})
= L* (M n E) + L* (M n (R\E)).
Then the same procedure follows as in a) to show E is Lebesgue measurable 
when a = 0. Then when a = 1 and т 1 e P, we let P = M U {т 1}, and if 
a e (0, 1), and {то, т 1} c P, we let P = M U {т0} U {т 1}; discussing in the

same way, we also get E is Lebesgue measurable when a = 1 and a e (0, 1), 
i.e., E is Lebesgue measurable.
(c) For a = 0, now suppose that E contains the minimum point т0 of T. It is 
obvious that if E is ♦ a-measurable, then E\{т0} is ♦ a-measurable, so E\{т0} 
is also Lebesgue measurable from (a); then we know that a single-point set 
{t0} is Lebesgue measurable and some union of Lebesgue measurable sets is 
Lebesgue measurable; (E\{т0}) U {т0} = E is Lebesgue measurable as well. 
Also for a = 1, we suppose that E contains the maximum point т1 of T; in the 
similar way, E is Lebesgue measurable. For a e (0, 1), if т0 e E or т1 e E, 
we can also get E is Lebesgue measurable. If т0 e E and т1 e E, we consider 
E = (E\{т0, т 1}) U {т0} U {т 1}; using the same way, we also get E is Lebesgue 
measurable.
The fact that if E is Lebesgue measurable then E is ♦a -measurable follows 
similarly. This completes the proof.

137
Proof Suppose that E c T, by Proposition 2.3, E is ♦ a-measurable if and only if 
E is Lebesgue measurable.
Now suppose that E П (R\T) = 0, i.e., E has some points that do not belong 
to T. Since T is Lebesgue measurable and if E is also Lebesgue measurable, then 
the intersection of two Lebesgue measurable sets is also Lebesgue measurable, and 
hence it is ♦ a-measurable. This ends the proof.

2.2 ♦ a -Measurable Functions and Lebesgue Measurable 
Functions
In this section, we will introduce the notions of combined measurable functions 
and establish some basic properties of ♦ a -measurable functions and Lebesgue 
measurable functions on time scales.
2.2.1 ♦ a-Measurable Functions
Definition 2.7 We say that f : T ^ R is ♦ a-measurable if for every в e R, the 
set
f -1((-rc,в)) = {t e T : f(t)<e}
is ♦ a -measurable.
n
Theorem 2.6 A simple function S : T ^ R with S = 
aixAi is ♦ a-measurable
if and only if Ai is ♦ a-measurable for all i e {1,..., n}.
Proof First, we suppose that the simple function S : T ^ R is ♦ a-measurable. By 
Definition 2.7, the set
S-1((-rc,в)) = {t e T : S(t) < в}
is ♦ a -measurable for all в e R with a 1 < a 2 < ... < an.
(i) If в < a 1, then S-1 ((-rc, в) = 0 which is known to be ♦ a-measurable.
(ii) If a 1 < в < a2, then S-1 ((-rc, в) = A 1 is ♦ a-measurable.
(iii) Let a2 < в < a3. In this case, S 1((-rc, в) = A 1 U A2 is ♦ a-measurable. 
From (ii), A2 is also ♦a-measurable since the difference of ♦a-measurable sets 
is ♦a -measurable.

138
2 ♦ a-Measurability and Combined Measure Theory on Time Scales
Repeating this procedure, for any value of в, the corresponding set U k=1 Ai.k = 
1. 2,.. .,n is ♦ a-measurable; then each Ai is ♦ a-measurable.
Now, suppose that each Ai is ♦ a-measurable for i = 1. 2.. ...n, then for 0 < 
k < n, the union Uk=1 Ai is also ♦ a-measurable which corresponds to the set 
{t e T : S(t) < в} for some в e R- For every в e R, there exists union |Jk=1 Ai; 
then we obtain that the corresponding simple function S is ♦ a-measurable. The 
proof is completed. 
□
Proposition 2.4 Let f be an extended real-valued function whose domain is ♦ a - 
measurable set E c T. For each real number в, the following statements are 
equivalent:
(i) the set {t e E : f(t)<0} is ♦ a -measurable;
(ii) the set {t e E : f (t) 
в} is ♦ a-measurable;
(iii) the set {t e E : f (t) < в} is ♦ a-measurable;
(iv) the set {t e E : f(t)>p} is ♦ a -measurable.
These statements imply
(v) For each real number в, the set {t e E : f (t) = в} is ♦ a-measurable.
Proof Since {t e E : f(t) < в} = E - {t e E : f(t) > в} and {t e E : f(t) > 
в} = E - {t e E : f (t) < в}, and the difference of two ♦ a- measurable set is ♦ a- 
measurable set. Then we just need to show (i) is equivalent to (iii). For this, we have
{t e E : f(t)

For (2.10), if (i) holds , then (iii) holds, and for (2.11), if (iii) holds, then (i) 
holds since the union of some ♦ a-measurable sets and the intersect of some ♦ a - 
measurable sets are also ♦ a-measurable sets. For the set {t e E : f (t) = в}, we 
can denote it by
{t e E : f (t) = в} = {t e E : f(t) > в} - {t e E : f (t) < в}.
or
{t e E : f (t) = в} = {t e E : f (t) < в} - {t e E : f (t) < в}.
so {t e E : f (t) = в} is ♦ a-measurable. This completes the proof.

Theorem 2.7 Let f be ♦ a-measurable on E c T and f = g, ♦ a-a.e.; then g is 
also ♦ a-measurable.
Proof Considering the definition of ♦ a-measurability and equivalent statements, 
♦ a -a.e., the difference between sets A = {t e E : f (t) < a} and B = {t e E : 
g(t) < a} is nothing but the set with ♦ a-measure zero, i.e.,
m♦ ((A - B) U (B - A)) = 0.
Thus, m ♦ (A - B) = 0and m ♦ (B — A) = 0. Without loss of generality, we assume 
f is ♦a-measurable. Since B = A U (B - A), it follows that the right-hand side of 
the equation is ♦a-measurable since it is the union of two ♦a -measurable sets. This 
completes the proof. 
□
Theorem 2.8 Let {gn(t)} be a finite ♦a -measurable function sequence on ♦a - 
measurable set E; then iBt) = infngn(t) and ^(t) = supngn(t) are ♦ a- 
measurable.
Proof According to the relation {t e E : ^(t) > в} = ПП=1{t e E : gs(t) > в} 
and {t e E : k(t) < в} = ПП=1{t e E : gs(t) < в}, we can get the desired result 
from Lemma 2.2 and Proposition 2.4. The proof is completed. 
□
Proposition 2.5 If f1 and f2 are ♦a -measurable functions on ♦a-measurable set 
E c T, then both set {t e E : f1 (t) < f2(t)} and {t e E : f1 (t) < f2(t)} are 
♦a -measurable.
Proof Since {t e E : f1 (t) < f 2(t)} = E - {t e E : f1 (t) > f 2(t)}, we just need 
to show {t e E : f1(t) < f2(t)} is ♦a-measurable. Assume x0 e{t e E : f1(t) < 
f2(t)}, i.e., f1 (x0) < f2(x0); then there must exist a real number p such that
f1 (x0)<p< f2 (x0),
i.e.,
xо e {t e E : f1 (t) <p} П {t e E : f2(t) > p},
and vice versa, so assume all such rational numbers are p1 ,p2,...; then
{t e E : f1(t) < f2(t)} = U ({t e E : f1 (t) < pi} П {t e E : f2(t) > pi f), 
and from Proposition 2.4, the right side of this equation obviously is ♦a-measurable.
The proof is completed.

Theorem 2.9 Every constant function defined on a ♦a -measurable set E c T is 
♦a -measurable.

2 ♦ a-Measurability and Combined Measure Theory on Time Scales
Proof Let f(t) = c for all t e E, where c e R. For the set {t e E : f (t) = c < в}, 
we consider в in two cases:
(i) For в 
c, this set corresponds E which is known ♦ a -measurable.
(ii) For в < c, this set corresponds the empty set which is already known ♦ a - 
measurable.
This completes the proof. 
□
Proposition 2.6 Let f and g be real-valued ♦ a -measurable functions defined on 
♦ a -measurable set E c T; y is a real number Then Yf, f + g , f — g, fg, and 
f 
— are also ♦ a-measurable. 
g
Proof For Yf, since f is ♦ a -measurable and the set {t e E : f (t) < в} is 
♦ a -measurable, for a = 0, obviously Yf is ♦ a-measurable since y is a constant 
function. If a = 0, we have {t e E : Yf(t) < в} = {t e E : f (t) < вY— 1} when 
Y > 0, then the result holds, and {t e E : yf(f) < в} = {t e E : f(t) > вY—1} 
when Y<0; from Proposition 2.4, the result also holds.
For f + g, if one of them is a constant function, then {t e E : f(t) + c< 
в, c, в e R}={t e E : f(t) < в — c, c, в e R}; the result obviously holds. 
If both f and g are not constant function, then {t e E : f(t) + g(t) < в, в e 
R}={t e E : f(t) < —g(t) + в, в e R}. Since —g(t) + в is ♦a -measurable, by 
Proposition 2.5, f + g is ♦a-measurable. For f — g, we can get the result similarly.
For fg, first we consider f2; for all в e E, we have
{t e E : f2(t) < в}=
0 
в < 0
{t e E : f(t) > JT>} П {t e E : f(t) < Jp} 
в > 0•
Hence f2 is ♦a-measurable. From the relation fg = ((f + g)2 — (f — g)2)/4, we 
obtain fg is ♦a -measurable.
For f = f ■ -, we need to show - is ♦ a -measurable. Since 
gg 
g
(t e E : - 
g
в) = (I {
e E

e E

e E 
: g(t)< 0} П {t e E : g(t) < в—1}),
в<0, 
в=0, 
в>0,
then i is ♦ a-measurable. This completes the proof.

Proposition 2.7 Assume that {fn(t)} is a ♦ a-measurable function sequence on ♦ a- 
measurable set E c T; then limn^OT fn(t) andlimn^OT fn(t) are ♦ a-measurable.

2.2 ♦ a -Measurable Functions and Lebesgue Measurable Functions
141
Proof Since
limn -\ fn(t) = sup ( inf fm(t)\, 
n m n
and
limn.... fn(t) = inf ( sup fm(t)\ 
n m n
from Theorem 2.8, the result holds. This completes the proof.
□
Corollary 2.4 Let {fn(t)} be a sequence of ♦ a-measurable functions on E c T .If 
this sequence is convergent with f(t) = limn^.v fn(t), thenf(t) is ♦ a-measurable.
Proof We need to show that for any в e R, f-1((-^■ в) = {t e E : f (t) < в} 
is ♦ a -measurable. In fact, we have
f-1 (
в)) = un r((
n=1 i=n

since {fn(t)} is ♦ a-measurable, according to Lemmas 2.1 and 2.2, we get the 
desired result. This completes the proof. 
□
Corollary 2.5 f is ♦ a-measurable if and only if both f + and f are ♦ a - 
measurable functions, where f+ = max{0, f} and f- = max{0, -f}.
Proof According to Definition 2.2, it follows that f = f+ - f -, where f+ = 
max{0, f}, f — = max{0, - f}. If f is ♦ a-measurable, then - f is also ♦ a- 
measurable; by Theorem 2.8, both f + and f- are ♦ a-measurable functions. If both 
f + and f- are ♦ a-measurable functions, f obviously is a ♦ a -measurable function 
since the difference of two ♦ a-measurable functions is also ♦ a-measurable. This 
completes the proof. 
□
Theorem 2.10 f is a ♦ a-measurable function if and only if for any в 1 < 
в2■ в 1 ■ в2 e R, the set {t e T : в 1 < f (t) < в2} is ♦ a-measurable.
Proof If f is a ♦ a-measurable function, for the set {t e T : в 1 < f (t) < в2}, we 
can rewrite it as
{t e T : в 1 < f (t)} - {t e T : f (t) > в2}■
from Proposition 2.4, it follows that {t e T : в 1 < f (t)} and {t e T : f (t) > в2} 
are ♦ a-measurable, and then {t e T : в 1 < f (t) < в2} is ♦ a-measurable. On the 
other hand, assume {t e T : в 1 < f (t) < в2} is ♦ a-measurable, since

2 ♦ a-Measurability and Combined Measure Theory on Time Scales
to
{t e E : f(t) >в 1} = U {t e E : в 1 < f(t) <в 1 + n}, 
n=1
then {t e E : f (t) > в 1} is ♦ a-measurable, and from Proposition 2.4, it follows 
that f is ♦ a-measurable. The proof is completed. 
□
Remark 2.9 For convenience, we use the definition of ♦ a -measurable: f is ♦ a - 
measurable if and only if for any open interval I c T, f-1 (I) is ♦ a-measurable.
By this fact, we will investigate the relation between the continuity and ♦ a - 
measurability of functions.
Proposition 2.8 Let f be a function defined on a totally discrete time scale T. Then 
f is ♦ a-measurable.
Proof We know that a single-point set and any countable union of single-point sets 
are ♦ a -measurable. If T is totally discrete, it can be represented as a countable union 
of single-point sets which are known ♦ a-measurable. For any function f defined on 
this time scale, we have f-1 (I) c T, which implies that the inverse image of any 
open interval under f can also be represented as some union of single-point sets; 
thus f is ♦ a -measurable. This completes the proof. 
□
Proposition 2.8 demonstrates ♦ a -measurability of any function defined on a time 
scale which only has isolated points. A time scale needs to be specified as it just 
has isolated points and does not have dense points; otherwise we cannot generalize 
this fact to all functions which are defined on any time scale since no one knows the 
property of a function on the set of left-dense and right-dense points and whether 
the inverse image of any open interval under f is ♦ a-measurable or not.
Remark 2.10 Notice that if f is defined on a subset of a totally discrete time scale 
T, then f is ♦ a -measurable.
Corollary 2.6 Let f be defined on any time scale T and f|SR represent the function 
restricted to the set of all right-scattered points of T. Then f | SR is ♦ a-measurable 
on SR.
Remark 2.11 Let f be defined on any time scale T and f|SL represent the function 
restricted to the set of all left-scattered points of T; we can also obtain f | SL is ♦ a - 
measurable on SL.
Theorem 2.11 If f is continuous function defined on a ♦ a-measurable set E c T, 
then f is ♦ a-measurable.
Proof Let 10 e {t e E : f (t) < в} = Q, в e R, since f is continuous; then there 
exists a neighborhood of t0, i.e., (t0 -8t0, 10+8t0)T; it satisfies (t0 -8t0, 10+8t0)ПE c 
{t e E : f(t) < в}. Let G = U10eQ(t 0 - 8t0, 10 + 8t0); then

t0eQ
On the other hand, since Q c G, we get Q c GH Q c GHE, i.e., Q = GHE. Thus 
we obtain that Q = G П E is ♦ a-measurable since G and E are ♦ a-measurable. 
This completes the proof. 
□
Corollary 2.7 If f is continuous function, then f is ♦ a-measurable.
Proof We adopt the definition given by Remark 2.9 to show the ♦ a-measurability 
of f. Firstly we consider the equality f-1 (I) = f |D 1 (I) U f |-1 (I) for any open 
interval I c T, where f |S-1 represents the inverse image of the function f restricted 
on the set of all right-scattered points and f |-D1 represents the inverse image of the 
function f restricted on the set of all right-dense points. Then it follows that f |S-1 
is ♦ a -measurable since the set of all right-scattered points can be represented as a 
union of single-point sets which is ♦ a -measurable, so we need to show f |D 1 is a 
♦ a-measurable function. Since f is continuous, thus for any given e > 0, there 
exists a 8 > 0 such that |f |DR(s) - f |DR(t)| < e, s e (t - 8,t + 3)T. Also, we 
have
(t-8,t+8)T={seT:|f|DR(s)-f|DR(t)| <e}
={s e T : f |DR (t) -e<f|DR(s) < f |DR (t) +e},
and since the left side of the equation is ♦ a-measurable, the corresponding right side 
is also ♦ a -measurable, i.e., f |DR is ♦ a-measurable. The proof is completed. □
Proposition 2.9 Assume f is defined on a ♦ a-measurable subset E of T. Then f 
is ♦ a-measurable if the set of all left-dense and right-dense points of E where f is 
discontinuous is a set with ♦ a-measure zero.
Proof Firstly, we classify E into five cases:
(i) A ={t e E : t is left-dense and right-scattered};
(ii) B ={t e E : t is left-scattered and right-dense};
(iii) C ={t e E : t is left-scattered and right-scattered};
(iv) Ds ={t e E : t is left-dense and right-dense and fis continuous at t};
(v) Db ={t e E : t is left-dense and right-dense and f is discontinuous at t},
and E = A U B U C U Ds U Db. Let p.♦ a(Db) = 0. We will approach to Db by 
defining a decreasing sequence of ♦ a-measurable sets. Let {Kn}neN be the sequence 
of ♦ a-measurable sets such that
Db c Kn c (Db U Ds ) for all n e N.

144
2 ♦ a-Measurability and Combined Measure Theory on Time Scales
Define Dn = Ar <n Kr; we obtain a decreasing sequence of the sets {Dn}neN. Let 
Db = QЖ= Dn and Fn = (Ds U Db)\Dn; it is obvious that f is continuous on 
Fn. Hence the restriction f | Fn of f is continuous, which implies that f | Fn is ♦ a - 
measurable from Corollary 2.7.
Moreover, {Fn} is an increasing sequence of the sets since {Dn} is decreasing. 
By taking the limit as n ^ ж, Ds U Cb = Dn U Fn, we have
Ds U Cb = lim (Dn U Fn) = ( lim Dn) U ( lim Fn)

Using this fact, we will investigate ♦ a -measurability of the function f defined on 
E = A U B U C U Ds U (UX1 Fn) and consider the following:
f-1 (I) = (f I-1) U (f I-1) U (f I-1) U (f I-1 (I)) U i f I-1

f (I) = (f|A ) U (f|B ) U (f|C ) U (f|D (I)) U f| ж F (I)

n=1
Notice that the right-hand side of this equation is ♦ a-measurable since it is a 
countable union of ♦ a - measurable sets, and so is the left-hand side, i.e., f is ♦ a - 
measurable. The proof is completed.

Theorem 2.12 Let f : T ^ R+ U {0} be a ♦ a-measurable function. There exists a 
sequence {<pn} of ♦ a-measurable simple functions for all t e T such that 0 < yn(t)

Proof Let f : T ^ R+ U {0} be a ♦ a-measurable function. For any k e N, divide 
[0, k] into k2k equal parts, and let
Bk = {t e T : (i - 1) 2-k < f(t) < i 2-k}, j = 1, 2,..., k 2k;
Bk = { t e T : k < f(t)} j = 1, 2,....
For each k, we define a sequence of ♦ a-measurable simple functions
Vk(t) =

k, t e Bk,
i = 1,2,...,k2k; k = 1,2,.....
Assume t e T; if f (t) = +ж, then 0 < f (t) - vk(t') < 2-k for k > f(t); 
if f (t) = +ж, then <pk(t) = k, k = 1, 2,.... Hence, for any t e T, we have 
limk^ж ^k(t) = f (t). This completes the proof.

2.2 ♦ a -Measurable Functions and Lebesgue Measurable Functions
145
Theorem 2.13 f is ♦ a -measurable if and only if it can be represented as the limit 
of a sequence of ♦ a-measurable simple functions which is uniformly convergent.
Proof If f (t) is ♦ a-measurable, then it can be represented as f (t) = f + (t) — 
f- (t), where f+ (t), f- (t) are the positive and negative part of f(t). From 
Theorem 2.12, we obtain that there are ♦ a-measurable simple functions {^kf(t)} 
and {v-(t)} such that
lim <p + (t) = f+(t), 
lim <p—(t) = f—(t).
k ^to 
k ^to
Let <pk(t) = ^+ (t) — yk (t), then {yk(t)} is ♦ a-measurable, and for any t e E, we 
have lim (pk(t) = g(t).
k ^to
If f(t) is bounded on E, assume sup{|f(t)|: t e E}=M; then from the proof 
of Theorem 2.10, we obtain that for any k>M,
sup{| f + (t) -Ф+(t)| : t e E} < 21k, 
sup{| f-)f)--(f)|: t e E} < 2k.
1
Hence, sup{| f (t) - yk(t)| : t e E} < 
^ 0 (k ^ to), so {yk(t)} is uniformly

2.2.2 Lebesgue Measurable and Lebesgue ♦ a-Measurable 
Functions
In this section, to compare measurable functions and ♦ a-measurable functions for 
a given function f : T ^ R, we need an auxiliary function which extends f to R, 
i.e., fk : R ^ R (k = 1, 2) defined as
fk1 (t) :=
f(t) if t e T, 
f k2 (t) = f(t) if t e T,
f(tf) if t e t^ott))), 
|f(ty) if t e (pttfftj).
(2.12) 
Denote I the index set of all right-scattered points in T, i.e., for i e I, ti represents 
a right-scattered point in T; similarly, J denotes the index set of all left-scattered 
points in T, i.e., for j e J, tj represents a left-scattered point in T.
Proposition 2.10 Let f be defined from T to the extended real line and f ♦ k(k = 
1, 2) is the extension of f defined by (2.12). Then f is ♦ a-measurable function if 
and only if f ♦ k(k = 1, 2) is Lebesgue measurable function.

2 ♦ a-Measurability and Combined Measure Theory on Time Scales
Proof Assume f is ♦ a -measurable; then for any real number в, f 1 ((-ж, в) = 
Вв is a ♦ a-measurable set. So it requires us to prove that for each в, f ♦ k ((-ж, в) 
(k = 1, 2)is Lebesgue measurable. In fact,
(f ♦1)-1((-ж,в)) = t e T J (ti,a(ti)) : f ♦1 (t) < в} 
i e Ibp
={t e T : f ♦1 (t) <в} U t e J (ti, a(t) : f ♦1 < в} 
i e 1вв
=Bp u( U (ti,v(ti))} = В%'.
' ieIbp 
'
Because we assume that f is ♦ a-measurable function, Вв is a ♦ a -measurable set; 
by Proposition 2.3, it is Lebesgue measurable. Hence (f ♦1)-1((-ж, в) = Bp 
is Lebesgue measurable since it is represented as countable union of Lebesgue 
measurable sets. The proof of the case for (f ♦2)-1 is similar.
Now we assume that (f ♦ k)-1 (k = 1, 2) is Lebesgue measurable. Using the 
equation
(f ♦ k)-1((-ж,в))р| T = f-1 ((-ж,в), k = 1, 2,
noting that (J♦ k)-1((-ж, в) is Lebesgue measurable, then we obtain 
f -1((-ж, в) is ♦ a-measurable from Corollary 2.3. The proof is completed.

2.3 ♦ a -Integral on Time Scales
In this section, we will introduce the notions of Riemann ♦ a -integral and Lebesgue 
♦ a-integral on time scales. Some basic properties of these two integrals are 
established and the relation between them is also presented.
2.3.1 Riemann ♦ a-Integral
Let T be a time scale and an interval [a, b]T; consider a partition of [a, b]T with a 
partition point set P = {10, 11,..., tn}, where a = 10 < t1 < ... <tn = b c [ a, b ]. 
Let f be a real-valued bounded function defined on [a, b]T .Weset

2.3 ♦ a -Integral on Time Scales
147
Ma = sup{ f(t) : t e [a, b)t}, ma = inf{ f(t) : t e [a, b)t},
Ma = sup{ f(t) : t e [ti—i, ti)t}, ma = inf{ f(t) : t e [ti — 1, ti)t}.
The upper Darboux ♦ a-sum Ua(f, P) and the lower Darboux ♦ a-sum La(f, P) 
of the function f are defined by
n
Ua (f, P) =
La(f, P) =
Mi [(1 — a){p(ti) - p(ti-1 )) + a(ti 
i=1
and
n
m2m1"[(1 - a)(p(ti) - p(ti-1)) + a(ti 
i=1
- ti -1 )
- ti -1 )
with respect to the partition P. The upper Darboux integral Ua (f) of f from a to b 
is given by
Ua (f) = inf{U a(f, P) : Pis a partition of [a, b]T},
and the lower Darboux integral La(f) of f from a to b is given by
La(f) = sup{La (f, P) : P is a partition of [a, b]T}.
Definition 2.8 f is said to be ♦ a-integrable from a to b if La(f) = Ua(f). We 
use the notation / f (s) ♦ as to denote this common value and call this integral 
a
Darboux ♦a -integral.
Lemma 2.6 (See [111]) For every 8 > 0, there exists at least one partition P : 
a = t0 <t1 < ... < tn = b of [a, b]T such that for each i e{1, 2, ...,n} either 
ti — ti-1 < 8 or ti — ti-1 > 8 and p(ti) = ti-1, where p denotes the backward jump 
operator in T.
Lemma 2.7 Let f be a bounded function on [a, b]T. If P1 and P2 are partitions of 
[a, b]a and P 1 c P2, then
La(f, P1) < La(f, P2) < Ua(f, P2) < Ua(f, P1).
Proof The inequality Laf, P2) < Ua(f, P2) is obvious, and the proof of the first 
and third inequalities is similar, so we will prove one of them

148
2 ♦ a-Measurability and Combined Measure Theory on Time Scales
La(f, P1) < La(f, P2).
An induction argument shows that we may assume that P2 has only one more point, 
say т, than P 1. If
P1 = {a = 10 <t 1 < • • • <tn = b},
and
P2 = {a = 10 < 11 < • • • < tk -1 < т < tk < ... < tn = b}
for somek e {1, 2,. ..,n}. Letting
ma = inf{ f(t) : t e [tk-1, tk)t}, m= inf{f(t) : t e [tk-1, т)t},
m2,,k = inf{ f(t) : t e [т, tk +1)t},
then
La(f, P2) - La(f, P1)
= m4k[(1 - a)(P(tk) - Р(т))
+ a(tk - т^ + ma,k[(1 - a)(p(t) - p(tk-1)) + а(т - tk-1)]
- mk[( 1 - a){p(tk) - p(tk-1)) + a(tk - tk-1)]
>m^txfk - т + т - tk-1 + tk-1 - tk)
+ (1 - a)(p(tk) - р(т) + р(т) - p(tk-1) + p(tk-1) - p(tk))] = 0.
Since ma k > ma,mak > ma, we get La(f, P 1) < La(f, P2). The proof is 
completed. 
□
Lemma 2.8 If f is a bounded function on [a, b]T and P1 and P2 are partition of 
[a,b]t,then La(f,P 1) < Ua(f,P2).
Proof It is obvious that P 1 U P2 is a partition of [a, b]t. Since P 1 c P 1 U P2 
and P2 c P 1 U P2, from Lemma 2.7 we obtain La(f, P 1) < La(f, P 1 U P2) < 
Ua(f, P 1 U P2) < Ua(f, P2). This completes the proof. 
□
Theorem 2.14 A bounded function f on [a, b]T is ♦a-integrable if and only if for 
any e > 0 there exists a partition P of [a, b]t such that
Ua(f,P) - La(f, P) <e.
(2.13)

2.3 ♦ a -Integral on Time Scales
149
Proof First, we assume that f is ♦ a-integrable. Then for any e > 0, there exists 
partitions P1 and P2 of [a, b]T satisfying
La(f,P 1 )>La(f) - 2 and 
Ua(f,P2)<Ua(f) + 2.
For P = P 1 U P2, Lemma 2.7 shows that
UafP) - LafP)<Ua(f,P2) -La(f,P1 )<Ua(f)+2 - (Lf - 2)
=Ua(f) - La(f) + e.
Since f is ♦ a-integrable and Ua(f) = La(f), then (2.13) holds.
Conversely, suppose that for each e>0 and (2.13) holds for some partition P. 
Then we have
Ua(f) < Ua(f, P) = Ua(f, P) - L'(l- P) + La(f, P) < e
+ La(f, P) < e + La(f).
Since e is arbitrary, in view of La (f) < Ua(f), we obtain that Ua(f) = La (f), 
i.e., f is ♦ a-integrable. This completes the proof. 
□
Theorem 2.15 A bounded function f on [ a, b ]T is ♦ a-integrable if and only if for 
each e > 0, there exists a 8 > 0 such that
Ua(f,P) - La(f,P)<e 
(2.14)
for all partitions P e P8, where P8 denotes the set of all partitions P that possess 
the property indicated in Lemma 2.6.
Proof Theorem 2.14 shows that the e-8 condition in (2.14) implies ♦ a-integrability. 
Conversely, suppose that f is ♦ a-integrable from a to b. Let e > 0 and select a 
partition
P0 = {a = то < т 1 < • • • <Tc = b}
of [a, b]T such that
Ua(f, Pо) - La(f, Pо) < e.
Let 8 = min{ Ti - Ti-1 : i = 1, 2,... ,c} ,t0 = т0, where c + 1 is the number of 
points of the partition P0. We assume that 8 = т1 - т0 ; then let t1 = т1; we have
(a) if a(t 1) = т2, consider the set A2 = {t : т 1 < t < т 1 + 8}; we have
(i) if A2 = 0, let 12 = max A2,
(ii) if A2 = 0,let 12 = a(t 1).

150
2 ♦ a-Measurability and Combined Measure Theory on Time Scales
Next, if a(t2) = т2 or т2 - t2 < 3, then let t3 = т2; if not, then we repeat the 
above step until we get some k such that a(tk) = т2 or т2 - tk < S.
(b) If a(t 1) = т2, then let 12 = т2.
By using the above step to add points into P0, finally we will get a partition Pn for 
some n such that Pn e PS, and P0 c Pn; by using Lemma 2.7, we obtain
La(f, P0) < La(f, Pn) < Ua(f, Pn) < Ua(f, Pо).
Hence we get Ua(f, Pn) - La(f, Pn) < Ua(f, Pо ) - La(f, Pо ) < e. The proof is 
completed. 
□
We now give the concept of Riemann ♦ a-integral.
Definition 2.9 Let f be a bounded function on [a, b]t and P : a = 10 < t1 < 
... <tn = b be a partition of [ a, b ]t. A Riemann ♦ a-sum of f associated with the 
partition P is a sum of the form
n
S= fj (nj) t a(ti - ti-1 ) + (1 - a)(p(tj) - p(tj-1 ^],
(2.15)
where n e [j-1 ,j)T for j = 1, 2,...,n. The function f is Riemann ♦ a- 
integrable from a to b if there exists a number I with the property that for each 
e > 0, there exists S > 0 such that | S - 11 < e for every Riemann ♦ a-sum S of f 
associated with a partition P e PS. The number I is called the Riemann ♦ a-integral 
of f from a to b.
Theorem 2.16 A bounded function f on [ a, b ]t is Riemann ♦ a-integrable if and 
only if it is (Darboux) ♦ a-integrable, in which the values of the integrals are equal.
Proof First, we assume that f is (Darboux) ♦ a-integrable from a to b in the sense 
of Definition 2.8. Let e > 0 and S > 0 be chosen so that (2.14) of Theorem 2.15 
holds. We need to show that
S - Lb 
♦ at
<e
for every Riemann ♦a -sum (2.15) associated with a partition P e PS .
Since La(f, P) < S < Ua(f, P) and Ua(f, P) - La(f, P) < e, then
Ua(f, P) < La(f, P) + e < La(f) + e = jb f(t)♦ at + e
and
La(f, P) > Ua(f,P)-e > Ua(f) - e = 1 f(t)♦ at - e,

2.3 ♦ a -Integral on Time Scales
151
and we get j f)s)♦ as - e < S < I f)s)♦ as + e. Hence, f is Riemann ♦ a- 
«/a 
a a
integrable and I = 
f)t)♦ at.
a
Now suppose that f is Riemann ♦ a-integrable in the sense of Definition 2.9. For 
any e > 0, let 8 > 0 and I be as given in Definition 2.9. Select any partition P = 
{a = 10 < t — 1 < ... < tn = b} such that P e P8, and for each j = 1, 2,. ..,n, 
we choose nj e [tj-1, tj)T such that f)nj) < mj + e, where m!' = inf{ f )t) : t e 
[tj-1, tj)t}. The Riemann ♦ a-sum S for this choice of nj satisfies
S < La(f, P) + ae(b - a) + (1 — a)e(p)b) - p)a)))
as well as |S - I | <e. It follows that
La(f) > La(f, P) > S - ae(b - a) - e( 1 - a)(p)b) - p)a)) 
> I - e - ae)b - a) - e) 1 - a)(p)b) - p)a).
Since e is arbitrary, we obtain that La(f) I. The proof for Ua)f) < I is similar. 
Since Ua)f) > La)f), it follows that La(f) = Ua)f) = I. Therefore, f is
(Darboux) ♦ a-integrable and 
f )t)♦ at = I. This completes the proof. □

Theorem 2.21 Let {fn(t)}neN be a sequence of ♦ a-integrable functions defined on

Proof Without loss of generality, we suppose that fn(t)

We define a sequence {gn}neN such that gn(t) = inf{fi(t) : i

Remark 2.13 Let {fn}neN be an increasing (or decreasing) sequence of functions

Proof We approach f(t) by a sequence of nonnegative ♦a -measurable simple

0 < J (yf) (s)♦ aS = J yf (s)♦ aS = У J f (s)♦ aS < +^,
so yf is ♦ a-integrable on E. Moreover,

If y < 0, then y = -| y |, and we have (- f)+ (t) = f — (t ), (- f )—(t) = f+ (t). 
So
(yf)+ (t) = IУI f — (t), (yf) — (t) = | y | f+ (t),
then

2.23
0 < (f + g)+(t) = max(f (t) + g(t), 0) < max(f+ (t) + g+ (t), 0)

0 < (f + g)-(t) = max(-f (t) - g(t), 0) < max(f -(t) + g-(t), 0)
= f - (t) + g - (t),
i.e., (f + g)+ and (f+g)- are nonnegative ♦ a-integrable on E; we have f+g 
is ♦ a-integrable on E.
(c) From (b), we obtain f + g is ♦ a-integrable on E, because f(t) = f(t) + 
- f-(t), g(t) = g+ (t) - g-(t), we have f (t) + g(t) = (f + g)+ (t) - (f +

and then (f+g)+(t)+f - (t)+g - (t) = (f+g)- (t)+f+ (t)+g+(t). According

2.3.3 Relation Between Lebesgue ♦ a-Integral and Riemann 
♦ a -Integral
In this section, we provide a comparison between Lebesgue ♦ a -integral and 
Riemann ♦ a-integral.
Theorem 2.27 Let [a, b)T c T and f be a bounded real-valued function on 
[ a, b) t . If f is Riemann ♦ a-integrable from a to b, then f is Lebesgue ♦ a-integrable 
on [a,b)t and j f(s)♦ as = j 
f(s)♦ as, where the left-hand side of the
equation is the Riemann ♦ a-integral and the right-hand side of the equation is the 
Lebesgue ♦ a -integral.
Proof Suppose that f is Riemann ♦ a -integrable from a to b. Then for each 
positive integer k, we can choose 8k > 0, (8 ^ 0 as k ^ to) and a partition 
(k) 
(k) 
(k)
Pk 
: a = 100' < t1 
< ■■■t„(k) = b of [a, b]T such that Pk e P8k and
Ua(f, Pk) - La(f, Pk) < 1 /k. Hence
lim La(f, Pk) = lim Ua(f, Pk) = Г f(s)♦ as. 
k ^to 
k ^to 
a
By replacing the partitions Pk with finer partitions if necessary, we can assume that 
for each k, Pk c Pk+1 holds. Let us set
a(k) 
r 
(k) Ak)x )
mi = inf f(t) : t e [ti-1,ti )T ,
a(k) 
(k) Ak)x
Mi 
= sup f(t): t e [ti-1,ti )T ,i= 1, 2,...,nk.
Then we define the following function sequences {vk} and {фk} on [a, b)T
Vk(t) = mf® and ф^) = M(k t e [ t^, t(k)) t , i = 1, 2,..., nk.
Then {vk} is a nondecreasing and {фk} is a nonincreasing sequence of simple 
♦ a -measurable functions with
Vk < Vk +1, 
Фk > Фk +1, Vk < f < Фk 
(2.17)
f 
Vk(s) ♦ aS = La(f,Pk), l 
Ф^') ♦ aS = Ua(f,Pk).
[a,b)T 
[a,b)T
Since f is bounded, the sequences {vk} and {фk} are bounded. Taking into account 
the monotonicity of (2.17), we obtain the limit functions

2.3 ♦ a -Integral on Time Scales

ф(Ь) = lim ^k(t), 
ф(Ь) = lim фк(Ь), 
t e[a,b)t. 
(2.18)
k ^to 
k ^to
It follows from (2.17) that
y(t) < f(b) < фО t e[a,b)T.
Since the functions y and ф are ♦ a-measurable as limits (2.18) of the ♦ a-measurable 
functions yk and фк, respectively, by Theorem 2.22, y and ф are Lebesgue ♦ a- 
integrable on [a, b)T and
lim ^k(s) ♦ aS =

k ^to [ a,b) T 
[ a,b) T
lim / фк($)♦ aS = 
фк(?)♦ aS.
k ^to [ a,b) t 
[ a,b) t
Therefore, according to the limit (2.18), we get
[ 
V(s) ♦ aS = У ф(?) ♦ aS = У f (s) ♦ aS
and we have
[ 
[ф(з) - y(S)]♦ aS = 0. 
(2.19)
[a,b)T
Since ф(Ь) - y(t) 0 for all t e [a, b)T, then (2.19) implies y(t) = ф(Ь), ♦ a- 
a.e. on [a, b)T. Thus, f (t) = y(t), ♦ a-a.e. on [a, b)T. Therefore, f is Lebesgue 
♦a -integrable, and the Lebesgue ♦a-integral of f over [a, b)T coincides with the 
Riemann ♦ a -integral of f from a to b. This completes the proof. 
□
The next theorem gives a Lebesgue criterion for Riemann ♦a -integrability.
Theorem 2.28 Let f be a bounded function defined on the bounded interval [a, b)T 
of T. Then f is Riemann ♦a -integrable from a to b if and only if the set of all 
left-dense and right-dense points of [a, b]T at which f is discontinuous is a set of 
♦a -measurable zero.
Proof First, for each positive integer k, let a partition Pk of [a, b]T and the functions 
^k, фк, ^ and ф be defined as in the proof of Theorem 2.27. We suppose that f is 
Riemann ♦a -integrable from a to b. Then let
to
П = II Pk, nD = {t e П : t is left-dense and right-dense}, 
k=1
H = t e[a, b]T : f is discontinuous at t},

HD = {t e H : t is left-dense and right-dense},
F = {t e [a, b]t : p(t) — ф(Ь)}.
Assume that the point t e[a, b]T such that
p(t) = f(t) = ф(Ь), t e П. 
(2.20)
Then f is continuous at t, otherwise there exist e > 0 and a sequence {ti}, lim ti = t 
such that | f (ti) — f(t)| > e for each i, and it contradicts the assumption (2.20). 
Note that for each right-scattered point of [a, b)T, (2.20) holds, i.e., they are 
partition points. From Lemma 2.15, for each right-scattered partition point ti, the 
next partition point ti+1 should be a(ti), i.e., ti+1 is a left-scattered point and hence 
all left-scattered points of [a,b]t are partition points. Therefore, we get HD c 
(F U nD). Moreover, since F and nD are at most countable and that each left-dense 
and right-dense point has ♦ a-measure zero and hence д♦ a(F) = д♦ a(nD) = 0, 
thus we get д♦ a(HD) = 0.
Now, we assume that the set of all left-dense and right-dense points of [a, b]T at 
which f is discontinuous is of ♦ a-measure zero: д♦ a(HD) = 0. For each positive 
integer k, we choose 8k > 0(8k ^ 0 as k ^ to) and a partition Pk : a = t0k < 
(k)

■< • • • << tn(k) — b such that Pk e ^p$ and Pk c_ Pk +1. Moreover, assu^me
t e[a, b)T is a left-dense and right-dense point and that f is continuous at t. Then 
for given e>0, there exists $>0 such that sup f —inff < e, where the supremum 
and infimum are taken over (t —$, t +$)T —{s e[a, b)T : t —$<s<t+$}. For all 
sufficiently large k, a subinterval of Pk containing t will be lying in (t — $, t + $)T 
and so ф^') — pk(t) < e. Since e is arbitrary, then p(t) — ф(Р). Next, at each 
right-scattered point t of [a, b]t, we have p(t) — ф(Ь).
Thus we have shown that p(t) — ф(Ь) provided either t is left-dense and right- 
dense or not by assuming f is continuous ♦ a-a.e. on [a, b)T. Therefore, F c HD. 
Since д♦ a(HD) — 0, we get д♦ a(F) — 0. Consequently, p(t) — ф(Ь) holds 
♦ a-a.e on [a, b)T. This implies that j <p(s)♦ as — J ф(я)♦ as and hence 
lim La(f, Pk) — lim Ua(f, Pk), i.ebf is Riemann ♦'^integrable on [a, b)T.

Proposition 2.13 Let f : [ a, b ]t ^ R be a monotone function. Then it is Lebesgue 
♦ a -integrable.
Proof First, we assume f is an increasing function; then if f is Riemann ♦ a- 
integrable, then it is Lebesgue ♦ a-integrable. We need to show that for any partition 
P e P$ , the following holds:

2.3 ♦ a -Integral on Time Scales
171
Ua(f, P) - La(f, P) <s for every s > 0,
where Ua(f, P) = 
Mf [a(ti - ti—1) + (1 - a)(p(ti) - p(t—1))] and
La(f, P) = m>n
ti e P
a(ti - ti-1) + (1 - a^p(ti) - p(ti-1))]
with
Mf = sup {f(t) : t e[ti-1 ,ti)T} and ma = inf ff(t) : t e[ti-1 ,ti)T}.
Thus
&
Ua(f, P)
La(f, P) =
(Mi - mi')[a(ti - ti-1) + (1 - a^p(ti) - p(ti-1 ^].
Now for the partition P e PS,S > 0, we need to consider two cases: the one case 
is for ti -1 is a right-dense point, and the other case is for ti -1 is a right-scattered 
point. For ti - ti -1 < S, ti -1 is understood a right-dense point; for ti - ti -1 > S, 
ti -1 is then a right-scattered point. Hence
Ua(f,P) - La(f,P)
= 
(Mi - mi)[a(ti - ti-1) + (1 - a)(p(ti) - p(ti-1))]
ti e (DrПP)
+ У } (Mi - mi)\_a(fi - ti-1) + (1 - a)(p(ti) - p(ti-1 ^].
(i) If t e SR n P, then Mf = mf. Hence
(Mi - mi)[a(ti - ti-1) + (1 - a)(p(ti) - p(ti-1))] = 0.
ti e (SRHP)
(ii) If t e DR П P, then Mi = f(t~) = lim f (t) and mf = f (ti-1). Hence

C ^2 (ft) - f(ti-1 ))[a(ti — ti-1) + 11 - a)(p(ti) - p(ti-1 ^]-

Now if ti-1 is right-dense, we will get
Ua(f,P) - La(f,P) < £ 
(f(ti) - f(ti-1))(ti - ti-1),
where ti - ti -1 < S 1 for any S 1 > 0, then
Ua(f,P) - La(f,P) < £

and now take S1 as
£
S 1 = —==---------------------------------- •

(f(ti) - f(ti-1))

If ti -1 is right-scattered, then
Ua(f, P) - La(f,P)
C 
(ft1)1 - f (ti-1 ^[a(ti - ti-1) + (1 - a){p(ti) - p(ti-1 ^],
ti e (SRnP)
then consider h = supi{ti - ti-1 : ti is left-scattered point}, we have
Ua(f, P) - La(f, P) < £ 
(f(ti) - f(ti-1))[(ti - ti-1) + (1 - a)h]
and take
£
S2 = —=--------------------------------------(1 - a)h^

f (f(ti) - f(ti-1))

Then let S = min{S1, S2}; we obtain
Ua(f, P) - La(f,P)<£
which implies Lebesgue ♦ a-integrability of f. This completes the proof.

2.4 Lebesgue-Stieltjes Combined ♦ a-Measure and Integral 
on Time Scales
In this section, we will introduce the notions of Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦ a-outer measure 
and Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦ a-measure and establish some main results.
2.4.1 Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦ a-Outer Measure and Related 
Properties
The original Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure is defined by introducing a pre-measure д 
on all intervals of R as follows:
Definition 2.13 (see [70]) The function д : JR ^ [0, +^) is called a pre­
measure if the following equalities are satisfied:
(i) д([a,b) = в(Ъ—) - в(а—),
(ii) д([a,b]) = в(Ъ+) - в(а—),
(iii) д'((a, Ъ]) = в(Ъ+) — в(а+),
(iv) д((а,Ъ)) = в(Ъ—) — в(а+),
where в : R ^ R is a monotone increasing function with в(Ъ—) = limt^ Ъ — 0(4) 
and в(Ъ+) = limt^Ъ + 3(t), JR denotes the family of all intervals of R, and дв 
denotes Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure.
Definition 2.14 (see [70]) Let P be a nonempty collection of subsets of a 
nonempty set X. The collection P is called an algebra of sets (or simply an 
algebra) if it satisfies the following properties:
(i) If A, B e P, then A П B e P
(ii) If A e P, then Ac e P, Ac = X\A.
In addition to being an algebra, if in=1 An belongs to P for every sequence 
{An}neN, P is said to be a a-algebra, and the pair (X, P) is called a measurable 
space, and the sets in P are called measurable sets.
In order to generalize this measure to time scales, we will first introduce the 
в
concept of a pre-measure m ♦.
Definition 2.15 The function m^ : Jt ^ [0, +^) is called a pre-measure if the 
following equalities are satisfied:
(i) m%a ([a, Ъ)t) = a(в(Ъ—) — 3(a—)) + (1 — a)(в(р(Ъ)—) — 3(p(a)—)),
(ii) m^a([a, Ъ]t) = а{в(а(Ъ)+) — 3(a—)) + (1 — a)(в(Ъ+) — 3(p(a)—)),
(iii) m^a (О1’ Ъ]t) = Дв(а(Ъ)+) — 3(a(a)+)) + (1 — а)(в(Ъ+) — 3(a+)),
(iv) If Ъ > a(a), then

174
2 ♦ a-Measurability and Combined Measure Theory on Time Scales
'm'a ((a,b)t) = a(0(b ) - 0(a(a)+)) + (1 — a)(0(p(b) ) - в(а+)), 
where a e [0, 1], JT denotes the family of all intervals of T, and в : T ^ R is a 
monotone increasing function.
Remark2.16 Note that the open interval {a, a(a)T is regarded as an empty set; 
then m^ (a:i,<Ea)')t) = 0. Similarly, [a, a)T and (a, a]T are also regarded as 
empty sets and have pre-measures zero according to Definition 2.15.
Remark2.17 Note that for T = R, since a(t) = p(t) = t, then Definition 2.15 is 
equivalent to Definition 2.13 immediately.
Now, we will introduce the notion of Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦ a-outer measure 
m0 )* as follows:
Definition 2.16 The function (m^ )* : JT ^ [0, +ж) associated with в defined 
by

♦a
i=1
m£ a(In),
is called Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦a -outer measure of Eif there exists at least one finite 
or countable covering system of intervals In c JT of E satisfies E c UП=1 In. 
We say (m^ )* (E) = ж if there is no such a covering of E. If
(m? )*(A) = (m? )*(A П E) + (m? )*(A П Ec) 
(2.21)
♦a 
♦a 
♦a
holds for all A c T, then we say E is (m^ )*-measurable (or в♦ a-measurable).
Based on Definition 2.16, the subadditivity of (m^ )* can be obtained.
Lemma 2.11 If A = |l n_ 1 Ii, then (m^ )* (A) < n 1 (m^ )* (Ii).

... U a(tn—1 ),tn U a(tn),b ; for each interval a(ti—1 ),ti (i = 1, 2, ••• ,n — 
1) or [a, tj]T and [сЕЕ), b|T, the smallest covering is itself for each interval. Hence 
from Definition 2.16, we obtain

Lemma 2.12 If E 1 and E2 are вVа -measurable, so is E 1 U E2.
Proof Let E 1 and E2 be вVа -measurable and A be a subset of T. Since E 1 is вVа -

Since S 1 n S2 = ((S 1 n S2)c}c = (SC U S2)c, S 1 n S2 is вVa-measurable. Further 
since S 1 - S2 = S 1 n SC, S 1 - S2 is also вVa-measurable. This completes the proof.

2.4.2 Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦ a-Measure and Related Properties
In this section, the symbol M((mp> )*) denotes the family of all (m^ )*- 
measurable subsets of T; then it forms a a -algebra according to Definition 2.14. 
We will use the symbols ^^, ^y to denote Lebesgue-Stieltjes A-measure and 
Lebesgue-Stieltjes V-measure, respectively.
Definition 2.18 The function (m^ )* : JT ^ [0, +ж) restricted to M(m1^ )*) 
is called a Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦ --measure and denoted by ^^ .
We know that each interval on T can be covered by itself, which is the smallest 
cover, i.e., any interval is в♦ a -measurable; thus for any interval I, pre-measure 
m^ (I) and в♦ a-measure ^^ (I) coincide, i.e.,
(i) ^la ([a, b)T) = a(в(Ь-) - в(а—)) + (1 — 
(в(р(Ь')-) — в(р(а) —)),
(ii) ^Ja([a, b]t) = a(P(a(b)+) — P(a—)) + (1 — ^')(P(b+) — P(p(a)—)), 
(iii) ^^a ((a, b]t) = a(P(((b)+) — P(a(a)+)) + (1 — ^')(((b+) — в(а+)),

(iv) If b > a(a), then
pja ((a, b)t) = a(f(b-) - f(a(a)+)) + (1 - a)(f(p(b)-) - f(a+)).
Proposition 2.14 Let {c} c T. Then it is pj -measurable and
pja ({cJ) = pja (fc,c]t)
= a(f(a(c)+) - в(с—)) + (1 - a)(в(с+) - в(р(с)-)).
Proof Note that a single-point set is a minimal cover of itself; the result is 
immediate. 
□
Remark2.18 There is a fact that [с, c]T, (p(c), c]T, and [c, a(c))T all have the 
same ♦ a-measure, but their pj -measures are completely different. For pj - 
measure, we need to consider one-sided limits of a monotone increasing function 
в at the endpoints of a given interval.
Example 2.4.1 Let T = [0, 3] U {7} U [8, 9], and
x + 1
f(t) =
5
x 2
if 0 < t < 3, 
if 3 <t < 8, 
if 8 < t < 9.
Now we calculate pj a -measure and pj -measure of the following sets:
(p(7), 7T, [7, 7]t, [7,a(7))T.
(1) Consider the pj a-measure of the above sets:
1. PJ Л(P(7), 7]t) = a(a(7) - 7) + (1 - a)(7 - p(7)) = 4 - 3a.
2. pj a ([7, 7]t) = a(a(7) - 7 + (1 - a^7 - p(7)) =4 - 3a.
3. Pj a ([7,a(7))t) = a(v(7) - 7 + (1 - aX7 - p(7)) = 4 - 3a.
(2) Consider the pj -measure of the above sets:
1. pj a ((p( 7), 7]t) = a (/3(v( 7)+) - f( 7+)) + (1-a) (7+-f(p( 7)+)) = 59 a.
2. pj a ([7, 7]t) = a (/3(v( 7)+) - /3( 7-)) + (1-a) (7+-f(p( 7)-)) = 58 a +1.
3. pja ([7,v(7))t) = a(/3(v(7)-)-/3(7-))+(1-a)(7--f(p(7)-)) = 1-a.

2.4 Lebesgue-Stieltjes Combined ♦ a-Measure and Integral on Time Scales
179
Example 2.4.2
(1) Let T = R; then pJ and pe measures (see [200]) coincide since for all t e 
T, a(t) = p(t) = t.
(2) Let T = Z; then
1. pJa ([a, b)t) = a(/3(b) - fi(a)) + (1 - a)(/3(b - 1) - /3(a - 1)),
2. pJa ([a, b]t) = a(P(b + 1) - fi(a)) + (1 - a)(j3(b) - /3(a - 1)),
3. pJa ((a, b]t) = a(P(b + 1) - P(a + 1)) + (1 - a)(j3(b) - fi(a)),
4. For b > a+1, pJ a ((a,b) t) = a (0(b) - 0(a + 1))+(1-a) (0(b-1) - 0(a)).
(3) Let в : T ^ T and 0(t) = t; then pJ-measure turns into ♦ a-measure:
1. pJa ([a, b)t) = a(b - a) + (1 - a)(p(b) - p(a)),
2. pJa ([a, b]t) = a(a(b) - a) + (1 - a)(b - p(a),
3. pJa (la, b]t) = a(a(b) - a(a)) + (1 - a)(b - a),
4. If b > a(a), pJ ({a, b)t) = a(b - o(a)^ + (1 - a)(p(b) - a),
which is equivalent to Theorem 2.5.
Example 2.4.3 Let T = [0, 4] U {5} U [7, 10] and
1 + e- t
if 0 < t < 2,
0(t) =
5 if 2 < t < 4,
3t - 4
212 + 3
if 4 < t < 8,
if 8 < t < 10.
Now we calculate peA -measure, pJ -measure, and pJ -measure of the following 
sets:
{3}, {4}, [4, 7), (8, 9], {5}, [0, 1).
(1) Consider the pJ-measures:
1. pA({3}) = в(o(3)+) - в(3-) = в(3) - в(3) = 0,
2. 
pA({40 = P(°(4)+) - в(4-) = в(5+) - в(4-) = 11 - 5 = 6,
3. pA ([4, 7)) = в(7-) - в(4-) = 17 - 5 = 12,
4. 
pA( (8, 9]) = f(a( 9)+) - f(a( 8)+) = в( 9) - в( 8) = 34,
5. pA({50 = P(a(5)+) - в(5-) = в(7) - в(5) = 6,

6. /У([0, 1)) = р(р( 1) — — р(р(0) — = ж since the limit from the left-hand

2. /♦ а ({4}) = /♦ а ([4, 4]) = а(в(о(4)+) — в(4—)) + (1 — а)(в(4+) — 
в(Р( 4)—)) = а(в( 5+) — в( 4—))+(1— а)(в( 4+) — в( 4—)) = 6 а+3 (1— а) =

3. /♦ а([4, 7)) = а(/3(7—) — в(4—)) + (1 — а)(в(р(7) — — /3(р(4)—)) =

4. /♦ а ((8, 9]) = а(р(а(9)+) — в(°(8)+)) + (1 — а)(в(9+) — в(8+)) =

5. /♦ а ({5}) = /^а([5, 5]) = а(в(а(5)+) — /3(5—)) + (1 — а)(в(5+) —

6. /♦ а ([0, 1)) = а(в( 1—) — в(0—)) + (1 — а)[в(р( 1) —) — в(р(0)—)) =

Remark 2.19 Through Example 2.4.3, one can obtain that the /♦ measure value 
of a set E c T is the following combination:
/♦ а (E) = а/Д(Е) + (1 — а)/У (E),
and we can obtain the /Д measure if а = 1 and the /У measure if а = 0.

2.4.3 Relationships, Extensions, and Composition Theorems 
for Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦ a-Measure
In this section, we shall compare the relationship between Lebesgue-Stieltjes 
measurable sets and Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦ a-measurable sets. Noticing that jf- 
measure of an interval ti,, a(ti )T with some right-scattered point ti or an interval 
p>tt)), jT with some left-scattered point tj is not defined, thus we need to extend 
в to the real line.
In fact, any function is left continuous at the left-scattered points and is right 
continuous at the right-scattered points; then the interval (p)))),)}T has a pe- 
measure that equals to e(tj) — P(p(tj). To prove this result theoretically, we need 
to extend the function в, and the extended function should be monotone everywhere 
and continuous at the scattered points.
Now, we extend в : T ^ R to the real line R as follows:
в ♦ (t) =
в к (t) =
f(t)ift e T,
в fitvtti) — PPPA f \ Q(f.\ 
( e(a(ti)) — fitt^Af.

(2.25)
which are linear functions at each ti,, ff(ti^ and (pjf), tj), respectively, where ti 
is right-scattered and tj is left-scattered, and also both of them are continuous at all 
scattered points of T. Hence we can obtain вк (tp) = P(ti )(k = 1, 2) where ti is a 
left-scattered point and вк(tj) = e(tj)(k = 1, 2) where tj is a left-scattered point.

(i) Let {11,12,.. .tn} be the set of all right-scattered points of [a, b)T such that 
a < 11 < 12 < ... < tn < b. Suppose that s = max{ti}n=1. Consider 
{d 1 ,d2, ...,dn} the set of all left-scattered points of [ a,b) T,suchthata < d 1 < 
d2 < ... < dn < b. Then we obtain [a, b)т = [a, 11)т U [a(t 1), 12]T U ... U

2.5 Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦ a-Measurable Function and
♦ a -Integral
In this section, we will establish some basic results of Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦ a - 
measurable function and ♦ a-integral.
2.5.1 Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦a-Measurable Function and 
Convergence Theorems
Definition 2.19 We say f : T ^ R is в ° a -measurable if for every y e R, the set
f-1( (-те, Y)) = {t e T : f(t) < y }
is в° a -measurable.
Theorem 2.29 A simple function S : T ^ R with S = П=1 "=1 aixAi is в ° a - 
measurable if and only if Ai is в ° a -measurable for all i e {1,..., n}.
Proof First, we suppose that the simple function S : T ^ R is ♦ a-measurable. By 
Definition 2.19, the set
S-1 ((-те,Y)) = {t e T : S(t) < у}
is в ° a -measurable for all у e R with a 1 < a 2 < ... < an.
(i) If y < a 1, then S-1( (-те, y) = 0 which is known в ° a -measurable with 
в
д° -measure zero.
(ii) If a 1 < y < a 2, then S-1( (-те, /)) = A 1 is в ° a -measurable.
(iii) Let a 2 < у < a 3. In this case, S-1( (-те, y) = A 1 U A 2 is в ° a -measurable. 
From (ii), A 2 is also в ° a -measurable since the difference of A 1 U A 2 - A 1 is 
в ° a -measurable.

2.5 Lebesgue-Stieltjes ♦ a-Measurable Function and ♦ a-Integral
185
Repeating the above same process, for any y, the corresponding set Uk=1 Ai,k = 
1, 2,. ..,n is в ♦ a -measurable; thus Ai is в ♦ a -measurable for each i.
Now, assume that Ai is в♦ a-measurable for i = 1, 2,... ,n, then for all у e R; 
there exist 0 < k < n, such that the union Uk=1 Ai = {t e T : S(t) < у} is 
в♦ a -measurable; then it follows that the corresponding simple function S is в♦ a - 
measurable. The proof is completed. 
□
Proposition 2.16 Let f be an extended real-valued function whose domain is в ♦ a - 
measurable set E c T. For each real number у, then the following statements are 
equivalent:
(i) the set {t e E : f (t) < у } is в♦ a -measurable;
(ii) the set {t e E : f (t) 
у } is в♦ a -measurable;
(iii) the set {t e E : f (t) < у } is в♦ a -measurable;
(iv) the set {t e E : f (t) > у } is в♦ a -measurable.
These statements imply:
(v) For each real number у, the set {t e E : f(t) = у } is в♦ a -measurable.
Proof For {t e E : f(t) < у} = E - {t e E : f(t) > у} and {t e E : f(t) > 
y} = E - {t e E : f (t) < у}, and the difference of two в♦ a-measurable set is 
в♦ a -measurable set. Thus it is sufficient to prove (i) is equivalent to (iii). Noticing 
that
{t e E : f(t)
y} = П |t e E : f(t) <y + j|
(2.26)
{t e E : f(t) < y}=
teE:f(t)
(2.27)
?c
УI

For (2.26), if (i) is true, then (iii) is true. Similarly, for (2.27), if (iii) is true, then (i) 
is true since the union of в♦ a -measurable sets and the intersect of в♦ a -measurable 
sets are also в♦ a-measurable. Since for the set {t e E : f (t) = у}, the following 
holds:
{t e E : f(t) = y } = {t e E : f(t) > у }- {t e E : f(t) < у },
or
{t e E : f(t) = y } = {t e E : f(t) < у } - {t e E : f(t) < y },
and then {t e E : f(t) = y } is в♦ a -measurable. This completes the proof. 
□
The following convergence theorem of в♦ a -measurable functions can be 
obtained.

2 ♦ a-Measurability and Combined Measure Theory on Time Scales
Theorem 2.30 Let {/„(t)} be a sequence of в♦ a -measurable functions on E c 
T. If this sequence is convergent with /(t) = lim„^v /n(t), then /(t) is в♦ a- 
measurable.
Proof We need to show that for any y e R, /-1((-rc>, y) = {t e E : /(t) < у} 
is в♦ a -measurable. In fact, we have
/ 4(-^,y )) = U n /i-,(( 
„=1 i=„

Since {/„(t)} is в♦ a-measurable, by Lemmas 2.12-2.14, then the desired result 
follows. This completes the proof. 
□
Theorem 2.31 Let / : T ^ [0, +^) be a в♦ a -measurable function; then there 
exists a sequence {фп} of в♦ a -measurable simple functions for all t e T such that 
Фп(Г) < Ф„ +1 (t) andlim„.... фп(Г) = /(t).
Proof Let / : T ^ [0, +^) be a в♦ a -measurable function, for any n e N, divide 
[0, „] into „2„ equal parts, and let
M„ = {t e T : (i - 1) • 2-„ < /(t) < i • 2-„}, 
i = 1, 2, ..., n2„,
M„ = {t e T : n < /(t)} i = 1, 2, ....
Then we can define a sequence of functions for each „ as follows:
Фп(ф) =
(i- 1)/2n,teBni, 
n, t e Bn
i = 1,2,...,n2n;n= 1,2,.....
Hence we obtain a sequence of simple functions фп(ф) with фп(Г) < фп+1 (t) < 
/(t),n=1,2,.....
Suppose that t e T, and if /(t) = +rc>, then 0 < /(f) — фп(1) < 2-n as 
k > /(t); if /(t) = +rc>, then фп(ф) = n,n = 1, 2,.... Therefore, for any t e T, 
we have lim„^OT фп(Г) = /(t). This completes the proof.

if 0 < t ф 4,
2 if0 < t < 4,
3 if 4 < t ф 10,
S2(t) =

Next we will evaluate the integrals of S 1 and S2 on [1, 9] with respect to в and 
compare the results.
In fact, 
[0, 4] П [1, 9] = [1, 4], (4, 10] П [1, 9] = (4, 9] and from the
Definition 2.20, the в♦ a -integral of S1 on [1, 9] is
£ S1 (s)♦ a0(s) = 2 • p^a ([1, 4]) + 3 • p^a ((4, 9]),
where
p^a ([1, 4]) = a(вФ(4)+) — в( 1—)) + (1 — a)(в(4+) — в(р( 1)—))

Thus we have

S 1 (5)♦ ae(s) = 2 • (3a + 7 - e-1) + 3 • (157 - 3a) = -3a + 457 - 2e-1.
[1,9]
Moreover, [0, 4) П [1, 9] = [1,4) and [4, 10] П [1, 9] = [4, 9]; from Defini­
tion 2.20, the в♦ a-integral of S2 on [1, 9] is
[ 
S2(s)♦ ав(5) = 2 • M>a ([1, 4)) + 3 • M>a ([4, 9])
with
M>a([1, 4)) = a(в(4-) - в( 1-)) + (1 - a)(в(р(4)-) - в(р( 1)-))
= a(5 - 1 - e-1) + (1 - a)(в(4-) - в( 1-)) = 4 - e-1
and
M>a ([4, 9]) = a(в(о(9)+) - 0(&(4)-)) + (1 - a)(в(9+) - в(р(4)-)) 
= a(в(9+) - в(4-)) + (1 - a)(в(9+) - в(4-)) = 160.
Thus
S s2(s)♦ ae(s) = 2 • (4 - e-1) + 3 • 160 = 488 - 2e-1.
[1,9]
Although these two simple functions are similar, the reason for the difference of the 
two integrals is the different values of the functions S1 and S2 at the discontinuous 
point t = 4.

Chapter 3
Shift Invariance and Matched Spaces 
of Time Scales
In this chapter, the concept of matched spaces of time scales is introduced and 
their basic properties are established. Based on this, the fundamental theory of shift 
invariance of time scales is addressed. In Sect. 3.1, the knowledge of periodic time 
scales with shift operators is introduced, and some properties of shift operators are 
provided. In Sect. 3.2, the singularity theory of time scales under the action of the 
shift operators is established. In Sect. 3.3, the notion of complete-closed time scales 
under shift operators is proposed and investigated. Section 3.4 is devoted to theory 
of the matched spaces of time scales, and the intrinsic connections of these basic 
concepts in these three sections are presented. In Sects. 3.5-3.6, the singularity of 
time scales under the action of the shift operators of the matched spaces and the 
shift with direction to avoid the singularity are presented.
3.1 Periodic Time Scales with Shift Operators
The discrete variable analysis has very important role in analyzing discrete dynamic 
equations (see DaCunha et al.[84], Kelley et al. [132], Kratz et al. [134-136], 
Lakshmikantham et al. [138], Marks et al. [145], Peterson et al. [153], Poulsen et al. 
[155], Potzsche [156,157], Sun et al. [167], Wang et al. [185,191]). In order to unify 
the common features of discrete and continuous analysis, the time scale calculus 
demonstrates the powerful function of unification (see Cheng et al. [81], Davis et al. 
[85], Hilscher et al. [124], Kaymakgalan et al. [130, 131]). In this section, we will 
introduce the notion of periodic time scales with shift operators based on the new 
concept of periodic time scales proposed in the literature [32, 33].

3 Shift Invariance and Matched Spaces of Time Scales
Lemma 3.1 If T* is the largest subset of T and includes a fixed number 10 e T* 
such that there exist operators S± : T* ^ T*, then
(1) S- (s,S + (u,t) = S + (S- (s,u),t\ 
S + (s,S- (u,t) = S- (S- (s,u),t\
(2) S- (s,S- (u,t) = S- (S + (s,u),t\ 
S + (s,S + (u,t) = S + (S + (s,u),t\
(3) 
S +(S-(u, s), S-(s, t)) = S-(S + (u, s), S + (s, t)) = S-(u, t).
Proof
(1) By using the properties of Definition 3 and Lemma 1 from [33], we can obtain
S-(s, S + (u, t)) = S-(s, S +(s, S-(s, S + (t, u)))) = S-(s, S +(s, S + (t, S-(s, u))))
= S-(s, S +(s, S +(S-(s, u), t)) = S +(S-(s, u), t). 
(3.1)
Since S + (S-(s, u), S-(u,s) = S-(s, s) = 10, we obtain S-(u,s) =
S- S-(s, u), t0 . Hence, we calculate that
S +(s,S-(u,t)) = S-(u, S + (s,t)) = S-(u, S + (t,s)) = S +(t, S-(u,s))
= S +(S-(u, s), t) = S +(S-(S-(s, u), 10), t) = S +(S-(S-(s, u), 10), t) 
= S +(S-(S-(s, u), t), 10) = S-(S-(s, u), t).
(2) By conclusion (1), we calculate that
S +(s, S-(S + (s, u), t)) = S-(S-(s, S + (s, u)), t) = S-(u, t).
Thus, we obtain S- {s, S-(u, t)} = S- (S + (s, u), t) immediately. Furthermore, 
we obtain
S-(s, S + (S + (s, u), t)) = S + (S-(s, S + (s, u)), t) = S + (u, t),
so we have S+ s, S+(u, t) = S+ S+ (s, u), t .
(3) Through calculation, we obtain the following:
S-(S + (u, s), S + (s, t)) = S +(S-(S + (u, s), s), t) = S +(S-(u, S-(s, s)), t)
= S + (S-(u, 10), 
= S- Ц,, S + (t0, f)) = S-(u, t).
Hence, S +(S-(u,s),S-(s,t)) = S-(S + (u,s),S + (s,t)) = S-(u,t). This 
completes the proof.

3.2 Singularity of Time Scales Under Action of Shift Operators 3±
199
3.2 Singularity of Time Scales Under Action of Shift
Operators 3±
In this section, we will introduce a notion called the “singularity of time scales.” 
Now we assume that 3 + (s, •) is a general forward shift operator and S- (s, •) is a 
general backward shift operator, where s denotes the shift size.
Definition 3.1 The point ш* is called the singularity of the time scale T under the 
action of the shift operators S± if for any t < ш* and any shift size s, we have 
S + (s, t) g ш +; or for any t > ш* and any shift size s, we have S + (s, t) g ш-, where 
ш + and ш- denote the right and the left neighborhoods of ш*, respectively.
Example 3.2.1 Consider T = {qn : q > 1, n e Z} U { - qn : q > 1, n e Z} U{0}. 
For any t e T*, take 10 = 1; we attach the shift operators
S+ (s, t) =
st, t > 0,
*-, t < 0,
S- (s, t) =
*-, t > 0, 
st, t < 0.
Hence, S± (q, t) e T* for all t e T* . However, for t<0 and any shift size s,we 
have S+(s, t) e 0+;fort>0 and any shift size s, we have S- (s, t) e 0-, so the 
origin t = 0 is a singularity of the time scale under S±. 
□

Example 3.2.2 Consider N± = { ± *Jn, n e N}. For any t e T*, take 10 = 0; we 
attach the shift operators
S+(s, t) =
Vs2 + t2, t > 0,
-^t2 - s2, t < 0,
t/t2 - s2, t > 0,
-^t2 + s2, t < 0.
S- (s, t) =
Now we have S-(s, t) e 0- for all t e (0, |s|]T* and S+(s, t) e 0+ for all 
t e [-|s|, 0)T*. Hence, 0 is a singularity of the time scale for the assigned shift 
operators. 
□
Remark 3.1 Note that if a time scale has a singularity ш* under the action of the 
shift operators S±, one can obviously observe that the point t will collapse into the 
singularity under the shift operators with the shift size s (see Fig. 3.1).
The following result is immediate:
Theorem 3.1 The subsets of time scales located on the two sides of the singularity 
cannot cross each other under the action of the shift operators S± with any shift 
size s.

In view of Theorem 3.1, we can obtain the following corollary:
Corollary 3.1 The time scales will never coincide with itself under the assigned 
shift operators 3± if it has a singularity for the assigned shift operators.
By Corollary 3.1, the two corollaries follow immediately.
Corollary 3.2 The time scales which are invariant under the shift operators have 
no singularity.
Corollary 3.3 The classical periodic time scales (i.e., the time scales with transla­
tion invariance (see [202])) have no singularity.
The next corollary follows from Corollaries 3.1 and 3.2 immediately.
Corollary 3.4 The time scales are invariant under shift operators 3± if and only if 
it has no singularity for the assigned shift operators.
Remark 3.2 Through Examples 3.2.1 and 3.2.2, the shift operators 3± are dis­
continuous at the singularity, which implies that the shift operators 3± are not 
A-differentiable at the singularity.
The following theorem follows according to Remark 3.2.
Theorem 3.2 If the shift operator 3- (s, •) (or 3 + (s, •)) is A-differentiable at t on 
the subset T of the time scale, then the set T has no singularity along the shift 
3- (s, •) (or 3 + (s, •)).
Remark 3.3 Notice that if one assumes that the shift operator 3- (s, •) (or 3 + (s, •)) 
is A -differentiable at t e T, it actually defaults that T has no singularity along the 
shift 3- (s, •) (or 3 + (s, •)).
Next, we will introduce a notion of “well shift” with respect to the shift 
operators 3±.
Denote О(ш*, e) the e-neighborhood of the singularity ш* and
S- := {3-(s,t) :Vt e T*};
S + := {3 + (s,t) :Vt e T*}.

3.2 Singularity of Time Scales Under Action of Shift Operators 3±
201
Definition 3.2 We say T* is a well shift with respect to the shift operator 3- (s, •) 
(or 3 + (s, •)) if for any e > 0, one has O(rn*, e) П S- =0 (or O(rn*, e) П S + = 0).
By Definition 3.2, the following result is immediate and basic:
Theorem 3.3 If T* is a well shift with respect to the shift operator 3- (s, •) (or 
3 + (s, •)), then the set S- (or S +) has no singularity during the shift 3-(s, •) (or 
3 + (s, •)).
To determine the set of a well shift with respect to the shift operators, we need 
the following definitions:
First, we give some necessary notations. Let T c T* .Denote the set
FTep := {s e R : 3 + (s, t) e T*, Vt e T}, sF := inf FTep;
and
B := {s e R : 3-(s, t) e T*, Vt e T}, sB := sup FTep.
Definition 3.3 We say the number s0F (or s0B) is the smallest forward step size (or 
the smallest backward step size) if T is a well shift with respect to the shift operator 
3 + (s, •) (or 3- (s, •)).
By Definition 3.3, we have the following theorem:
Theorem 3.4 If T is a well shift with respect to the shift operator 3- (s, •) (or 
3 + (s, •)), then the set T' := {s e T : s < sB} or (T' := {s e T : s > sF}) 
is a well shift with respect to the shift operator 3 + (s, •) (or 3- (s, •)).
Proof In view of Definition 3.3 and Theorem 3.3, the result is obvious. 
□
Remark 3.4 Theorem 3.4 demonstrates that a well shift can be equivalently 
described by both shift operators 3- (s, •) and 3 + (s, •) simultaneously. By arbitrarily 
choosing one of these two shift operators, one can equivalently depict the same well 
shift.
Remark 3.5 According to Theorem 3.4, we know that if T is a well shift with 
respect to the shift operator 3- (s, •) (or 3 + (s, •)), the set T := {s e T : s>s0B} 
(or T” := {s e T : s < s0F}) collapses into a singularity. For convenience of our 
future use, let X be a Banach space; we stipulate the function value of f : T" ^ X 
as follows:
f (3 + (s, t)) := f (t) (or f (3- (s, t)) := f (t)) for all t e T".

202
3 Shift Invariance and Matched Spaces of Time Scales
3.3 Complete-Closed Time Scales Under Shifts
In this part, we will introduce the concept of the complete-closed time scales under 
shift operators which are more general than the shift operators proposed in Sect. 3.1.
We assume that S± are shift operators fulfilling Definition 3 from [33] and DD± := 
{(s, t) e [t0, ж)T x T* : S±(s, t) e T*}, where T* is the largest (open) subset of 
the time scale T, i.e., T* = T. If S± (s, t) is A-differentiable to its second argument, 
then S±(s, t) denotes the A-derivative of S±(s, t) to its second argument.
Remark 3.6 According to Theorem 3.2 and Remark 3.3, the condition that S±(s, •) 
is A-derivable to its second argument implies that the point t will never collapse 
into a singularity after the step size s, i.e., all the singularities can be avoided in a 
A-differentiable domain of S±(s, •).
Now, we will provide an example to show Definition 1.22 must be improved.
Example 3. 3.1 Consider the following time scale:
T = -qZ и {1} = { - qn : q > 1 ,n e Z U {1}. 
(3.2)
For such a time scale, we can obtain that T* = {- qn : q > 1, n e Z U {1}. Take
the initial point 10 = 1 and the shift operators S-(s, t) = — st, S + (s, t) = -t.
Let П- = { - qn : q > 1, n e Z+} c T*. We can obtain S±(s, t) e T* for any
s e П-. Hence, according to Definition 1.22, the time scale T cannot be regarded 
as a periodic time scale under shifts S± since there is no number P e (1, +ж)T* 
satisfying (1.58). However, this time scale is the opposite number set of the time 
scale qZ = qn : q>1,n e Z и {0}, and the time scale (3.2) also plays an 
important role in q-difference equations. In fact, from (3.2), it is easy to observe 
that for any t e T*, one can obtain -(-q)t e T* but -q e [1, +ж)T*. 
□
For convenience, we introduce the following notations: Let
D± = {(s, t) e T* x T* : S±(s, t) e T*}.
For any s e T*, denote
T*s- := S-(s, T*) := {S-(s, t) : (s, t) e D-, Vt e T*}, 
(3.3)
Ts+ + := S + (s, T*) := {S + (s, t) : (s, t) e D+, Vt e T*}. 
(3.4)
Definition 3.4 Let T be a time scale with the shift operators S± associated with the 
initial point 10 e T*. The time scale T is said to be bi-directional shift complete- 
closed time scales (i.e., S-CCTS for short) in shifts S± if
П := {p e T* : (p, t) e D± for all t e T*} = П± £ {{t0}, 0}. 
(3.5) 

3.3 Complete-Closed Time Scales Under Shifts
203
Remark 3.7 Note that from (3.3) and (3.4), we have (3.5) can be written into the
equivalent form П = {p e T* : T*p± C T*} e {{t0}, 0}.
Furthermore, from (3.5), we will refine the following the concept of S-CCTS 
attached with shift direction. For convenience, we will use the notations
+ 
* 
Sp r— nr1* 
— 
* np^p — r— HT1* 1
П+ := p e T : T/ c T , П := p e T : T/ c T .
Definition 3.5 Let T be a S-CCTS; then (i) we say S-CCTS is with positive 
direction if П+ e {{t0}, 0}; (ii) we say S-CCTS is with negative direction if 
П— e {{10}, 0}; (iii) we say S-CCTS is with bi-direction if П e {{t0}, 0}.
Remark 3.8 From Definition 3.5, one can observe that a bi-direction S-CCTS is 
also with a positive direction and a negative direction.
Example 3. 3.2 From Definitions
 and 
, we provide the following examples of 
S-CCTS:
 3.4
3.5
(1) Let T = (—q)Z U {1} = {(—q)n : q > 1, n e Z} U {0, 1}. We obtain that 
П± = {(—q)2n : q > 1, n e Z+J. For such a time scale, for any t e T*, take 
t0 = 1; we attach the following shift operators:
3 + (s,t) =
st, t > 0, 
t, t < 0,
3—(s, t) =
t, t > 0, 
st, t < 0.
Then, there exists q2 e П± such that S±(q2, t) e T* for all t e T*, i.e., 
П± e {{1}, 0}. From Definition 3.5, we have T is a S-CCTS with bi-direction. 
(2) Consider T = {qn : q > 1, n e Z} U { — qn : q > 1, n e Z} U {0}. For such 
a time scale, for any t e T*, take 10 = 1; we attach the shift operators
S+(s, t) =
st, t > 0, 
Ls, t < 0’
S—(s, t) =
*-, t > 0’ 
st, t < 0.
We obtain that П± = qqn : q > 1, n e Z+J. Then, there exists q e П± such 
that S±(q, t) e T* for all t e T*, i.e., П± e {{1}, 0}. From Definition 3.5, we 
have T is a S-CCTS with bi-direction.

(3) Consider N± = { ± V”, n e N}. For such a time scale, for any t e T*, take 
t0 = 0; we attach the shift operators
S+ (s, t) =
V t2 — s2, t > 0, 
—V t2 + s2, t < 0.
Ss2 + t2, t > 0,
—V t2 — s2, t < 0,
S—(s, t) =

3 Shift Invariance and Matched Spaces of Time Scales
We obtain that П± = N2 = {^n : n e N}. Then, there exists 1 e П± such 
that S±(1, t) e T* for all t e T*, i.e., П± e {{0}, 0}. From Definition 3.5, we 
have T is a S-CCTS with bi-direction.
(4) LetT1 = {qn : q > 1, n e Z+}U{1} andT2 = {qn : q > 1, n e Z-}U{0, 1}. 
For these two time scales, take t0 = 1 and
n+ = {qn : q > 1, n e Z+} C T, П- = {qn : q > 1, n e Z—} C T2.
Note that for any s 1 e П+, s2 e П-, we obtain
S+(s1, t1) = s1t1 e T1* for all t1 e T1*,
S — (s 1, 11) = — e T* for 11 = q, s 1 = q2, 
s1
and
S- (s2, t2) = s2t2 e T2* for all t2 e T*2 ,
s+(s2, 12) = — e T2 for 12 = 1, s2 = -2. 
s2 q 
q2
Hence, for the shift operator S+(s, t) = st, one can see T1 is a positive-direction 
S-CCTS. For the shift operator S- (s, t) = st, we have T2 is a negative-direction 
S-CCTS. 
□
Remark 3.9 We attached the translation direction to the time scales in [180, 202] 
and introduced the concept of translation complete-closed time scales (i.e., T - 
CCTS). We also introduced the concepts of some special functions arising from 
differential and difference equations on T -CCTS including almost periodic func­
tions and almost automorphic functions. However, these results will never cover 
some important and irregular time scales such as (-q)Z and qZ, etc.
Remark 3.10 Note that if T is a periodic time scale under translations and П C T*, 
then the shift operators will fulfill S±(t, t) = t ± т e T with the initial point 10 = 0. 
Hence, if П c T*, then T-CCTS is included in 5-CCTS.
Remark 3.11 Note that a bi-direction S-CCTS may have singularities for the 
assigned shift operators (see Example 3.3.2).
If T is a bi-direction 5-CCTS and 10 is the initial point, then for any s e П, we 
define a function A : П ^ П,
A(s) =
S+ (s, t0), 
s > t0,
S- (s, t0), 
s < t0,
(3.6)

3.4 The Matched Space of Time Scales and Shift Invariance

which will be used later. Note that A(s) > t0 and A(s) > s.
Remark 3.12 If T is a T-CCTS with the translation operators S± (s, t) = t ± s and 
t0 = 0, then (3.6) will become 
A(s) =
s, s > 0,
-s, 
s < 0,
that is, A(s) =|s| >s.
3.4 The Matched Space of Time Scales and Shift Invariance
In [33], Adivar proposed a new concept of periodic time scales under shift operators, 
and this approach enables one to investigate this periodicity notion on a large class 
of time scales. For example, periodic solutions for q -difference equations could be 
considered since the time scale
qZ = {qn : q > 1 is a constant and n e Z} U {0} 
(3.7)
belongs to periodic time scales introduced by Adivar.
Note (3.7) satisfies Definition 1.22 by taking 10 = 1, T* = qZ, P = q > 1, and 
one should note that (3.5) must satisfy the requirement that
10 = P := inf {p e (t0, те)T* : (p, t) e DT for all t e T*} e T,
which indicate that the period P of the time scale is taken from T. Nevertheless, we 
provide the following example to demonstrate that not all periodic time scales will 
satisfy Definition 1.22.
Example 3.4.1 Consider the following time scale where a, b > 0,
Pa,b = (j [(2k + 1 )(a + b),(2k + 1 )(a + b) + a]. 
k=—to
This is a classical periodic time scale with period P = 2(a + b) e Pa,b and its 
period set П = {2n(a + b), n e Z} satisfy Pa,b П П = 0. For a particular case, let 
a = b = 1; we obtain the time scale
T = P1,1 = (j [4k + 2, 4k + 3].
k=—to
Clearly 4n e P1,1 for n e Z. Since its period set П = {4n, n e Z}, P = 4, we 
have Pa,b П П = 0.

3 Shift Invariance and Matched Spaces of Time Scales
Wang and Agarwal proposed Example 3.4.1 in [177] and corrected the concept of 
almost periodic functions on periodic time scales. Note that Example 3.4.1 satisfies 
Definition 1.21 but does not satisfy Definition 1.22 since P g Pa,b though t ± P e 
Pa,b. As a result, Definition 1.22 does not include Definition 1.21. In [180, 188], 
the authors introduced some new concepts of periodic time scales attached with a 
“translation direction.” In addition, several examples were provided to show these 
new concepts are more general than Definition 1.21 and the composition theorem of 
time scales from [178, 180] will be guaranteed under these new notions. Moreover, 
the authors of the literatures [187, 194] proposed and solved the almost periodic 
problems for q -dynamic equations on the quantum time scale for the first time, and 
the authors introduced the theory of almost periodic functions under shift operators 
which can derive and include the almost periodic theory of q -dynamic equations on 
the quantum time scale. Also, some new almost periodic functions were constructed 
on irregular time scales under the stochastic background. Furthermore, in the 
literature [9], the authors made some significant comments and notes on their 
related works and the recent development of time scales to contribute to solving 
the closedness problems on various types of time scales.
The closedness of time scales under shifts is a key and difficult problem which 
needs to be solved since it is closely related to defining and studying functions, 
investigating delay dynamic equations on time scales and nonlinear periodic or 
nonperiodic phenomena in the real world. In this part, we initiate the idea that the 
shift number set which controls the shifts of a time scale and maintains its shifts 
closedness may be separated from the time scale (e.g., TnП = 0 in Example 3.4.1). 
Using the algebraic structure of a group, the concept of a matched space for time 
scales is introduced, and the algebraic structure of matched spaces is constructed 
to solve the closedness of time scales under non-translational shifts. With this 
algebraic structure, a new concept of periodic time scales is introduced, and based 
on it, the new concepts of periodic functions, almost periodic functions, and almost 
automorphic functions are proposed through non-translational shifts. Furthermore, 
these notions attached with shift directions are also introduced and studied.
Now, we construct the algebraic structure for a pair (П*, 3) by using a property 
that is similar to a group structure to introduce the definition of a relatively dense 
set with respect to the pair (П*, 3), where П* is a subset of R together with an 
operation 3 and П = П*.
Definition 3.6 Let en* > 0 with 3(en*, т) = т for all т e П*; we say the set
П+ = {т e П* : т > en*}
the positive П*-set and the set
П- = {т e П* : т < en*}
the negative П*-set.

3.4 The Matched Space of Time Scales and Shift Invariance
207
Definition 3.7 Let П* be a subset of R together with an operation 3 and the pair 
(П*, 8) satisfies the following conditions:
(1) П* is closed with respect to an operation 8, i.e., for any т 1, т2 e П*, we have 
8(т 1 ,т2) e П*.
(2) For т e П+ or П-, 8(•, т) is increasing. Denote the set
IП* := {т e П* : 8(•, т) is increasing with respect to т},
i.e., IП* = П+ or П-. In addition, The operator 8 has the inverse operator 
3-1 : IП* x IП* ^ IП* and 8^], 8-1 (n, т^ = т, where т, n e IП*.
(3) For any т e П*, there exists an element en* e П* such that 8(en*, т) = 
8 (т,еп *) = т.
(4) For any т 1, т2 e П*, we have 8(т 1, т2) = 8(т2, т 1).
(5) For all т 1, т2, т3 e П*, 8(т 1, 8(т2, т3)) = 8(8(т 1, т2), т3).
A subset S of R is called relatively dense with respect to the pair (П*, 8) if there
exists a number L e IП* such that [a, 8(a, L)|n* A S = 0 for all a e П*, where
Оа, 8(a,L)]„* =
[a, 8(a, L)]П*, if L e П+, 
[8(a, L), a]П*, if L e П-.
The number |L | is called the inclusion length with respect to the pair (П*, 8).
Remark 3.13 According to Definition 3.7, П* is closed with respect to 3. Note that 
the set IП* is chosen from П* through the increasing property of 8i. Although the 
pair (IП*, 3) has the properties similar to a group, it may allow to have no inverse 
element.
Remark 3.14 Note that from Definition 3.7, one can derive some classical concepts 
of relatively dense set. Here, we present some of these.
(i) If IП* = R+ or R- and 8 (т 1, т2) = т 1 + т2, then еП* = 0. Thus, we
immediately get the following concept:
Definition 3.8 (Definition 1.10 from [108]) A subset S of R is called rela­
tively dense with respect to the pair (R, +) if there exists a number L>0 such 
that [a, a + L]AS =0for all a e R+ and there exists a number L<0 such 
that [a + L, a]AS =0for all a e R-. The number |L| is called the inclusion 
length with respect to the pair (R, +).
(ii) If IП* = hZ+ or hZ-, h > 0 and И(т 1, т2) = т 1 + т2, then еП* = 0. Thus, 
we immediately get the following concept:
Definition 3.9 A subset S of R is called relatively dense with respect to the 
pair (hZ, +) if there exists a number L e hZ+ such that [a, a + L]hZ A S =0 

208
3 Shift Invariance and Matched Spaces of Time Scales
for all a e hZ. The number L is called the inclusion length with respect to the 
pair (hZ, +).
(iii) If In* = qZ+ := {qn : q > 1, n e Z+} or qZ := {qn : q > 1, n e Z—} and 
3(т 1, т2) = т 1 • т2, then en* = 1. Thus, we establish the following concept:
Definition 3.10 A subset S of R is called relatively dense with respect to the 
pair (qZ, •) if there exists a number L e (1, +^)qZ such that [a,aL ]qZ ПS = 0 
for all a e qZ . The number L is called the inclusion length with respect to the 
pair (q Z, •).
1
(iv) If П* = N± := { ± Jn, n e N} and
т12 + т22 , 
т1 > 0,
т12 + т22 , т1 < 0,
then en* = 0.
Then
1 J т 2+т2 
1
N+  ---------> N+ := in *;
1 -J т 2+т2 
1
N2 —------ > N2 := I2n*.
П
Hence, it follows from the increasing property of 8, for т 1 > 0, we have In* = 
1 
1
N+ and for т 1 < 0, we have In* = N—, so we can choose them both to 
describe the concept of relatively dense set with respect to (In*, 8). Therefore, 
one has the following concept:
Definition 3.11 A subset S of R is called relatively dense with respect 
1 
_
to the pair (N±, 8) if there exists a number L e (0, +^) 1 such that 
____ 1 
+
[a,\Ja2 + L2] 1 П S = 0 for all a e Nj+ and there exists a number
+ 
___________ 1
L e (—^, 0) 1 such that [—Va2 + L2, a] 1 П S = 0 for all a e N—. The 
N— 
n—
1 
_
number | L | is called the inclusion length with respect to the pair (N±, 8).
Notice that for cases (i), (ii), and (iii), we have In* = П+ or П —, since 8 (•, т) is 
increasing with respect to т e П* and properties (3), (4), (5) in Definition 3.7 hold. 
However, cases (i)-(iv) show that In* с П*, i.e., In* is a proper subset of П* and 
there is no inverse element in In*.

3.4 The Matched Space of Time Scales and Shift Invariance
209
From Definitions 3.8-3.11, one will see that by employing Definition 3.7, some 
new concepts of relatively dense sets for various types of time scales can be derived. 
It is easy to observe that Definition 3.8 is suitable for T = R, Definition 3.9 is 
appropriate for T = hZ, Definition 3.10 is suitable for T = qZ, and Definition 3.11 
1
is applicable to T = N±.
Similarly, by using the operator 8, one can also establish the concepts of relatively 
dense sets for T = -qZ U qZ and (-q)Z, q > 1, etc. Hence, it is obvious that 
Definition 3.7 is so general that it can unify the concepts of relatively dense sets for 
many irregular time scales; it will be a useful tool to describe the almost periodicity 
of functions on a more comprehensive scope of time scales.
Remark 3.15 If П* forms a group, i.e., there is an inverse element т-1 of т, one 
can easily obtain 3-1 (т 1, т2) = 8(т-1, т2). In fact,

(т 1 ,т2)]] = 8{8(т- ,т 1), 8 
(т 1 ,т2)] = 8 
(т 1 ,т2).
Theorem 3.5 If П* forms an Abelian group, then In* = П*.
Proof Since П* forms an Abelian group, for any т e IП*, there is т-1 such that 
8 (т, т-1) = en*. Hence, for any т e П* and т 1 < т2 < en* < 0, we have 
8 (т, т-1) > 8 (т, т—1) from Definition 3.7 (2). Thus
8(т 1, 8т 1, т^ > 8(т 1, 8(т2 1, т),
and then we have
-1 
-1
8 8(т1, т1- ), т > 8 т2- , 8(т1, т) ,
i.e.,
т > 3(т—1, И(т 1, т)).
By Definition 3.7 (2), we have
-1 
8(т2, т) > 8 т2, 8 т2- , 8(т1, т) ,
i.e., 8(т2, т) > 8(т 1, т), so 8(т, т2) > 8(т, т 1); then И is increasing with respect to 
its second argument for т 1 < т2 < en* < 0. The proof is completed. 
□
According to Definition 3.7, one can obtain the following property:
Theorem 3.6 Let a pair (П*, H) be an Abelian group and 8i(•, т) is increasing on 
П*, т1, т2 e П*. Then

Hence, the desired result follows. This completes the proof. 
□
Next, we introduce the concept of an adjoint mapping between T* and In* to lay 
the foundation for introducing the matched space of time scales.
Definition 3.12 Let T and In* be time scales, where T = Uie 11 Ai, In* = 
Uie12 Bi, where Ai П Ai+1 = Bi П Bi+1 = 0, Ai, Bi are continuous closed intervals 
of R, and 11,12 are countable index sets; then we say In* is an adjoint set of T* if 
there exists a surjection
F : 
T 
^ I n *
A e {Ai, i e 11} ^ B e {Bi, i e I2}■>
i.e., F(A) = B. Now F is called the adjoint mapping between T and In*.
Example 3.4.2 In the following, according to Definition 3.12, one can see that In* 
is an adjoint set of T.
(1) Consider the following time scale T and the set In*
T = {2i : i e Z}, In* = {3i : i e Z+} U {1},
and there exists a surjective mapping
F : 
T*

In*
A e {2i, i e Z} ^ B e {3i, i e Z} U {1}
A 
^ 
3I 1 = B,
i.e., F(A) = B. Note that In* ^ T and en* = 1. Here, 8(r 1, r2) = r 1 • r2.
(2) Consider the following time scale T* and the set In*
T = U[i(a + b), i(a + b) + b], where a = -b, In* = {i(a+b) : i e Z+}U{0},

i.e., F(A) = N ◦ Z(A) = B. Note that In* C T and en* = 0. Here,
i(т 1, т2) = (Vn + VT2)2•
□
We introduce an operator i with the following algebraic structure between T and 
I П *.
Definition 3.13 Let the pair (П*, 3) satisfy Definition 3.7 and In* be the adjoint set 
of T and F the adjoint mapping between T and I n * .Theoperator 3 : П *xT* ^ T* 
satisfies the following properties:
(P1) 
(Monotonicity) The function 3 is strictly increasing with respect to its all
arguments, i.e., if
(T0, t), (T0, u) e Ds := {(s, t) e In* x T* : 8(s, t) e T*},

212
3 Shift Invariance and Matched Spaces of Time Scales
then t < u implies 8(T0, t) < 8(T0, u); if (T1, u), (T2, u) e Ds with T1 < T2, 
then 8(T1 ,u) < 8(T2,u).
(P2) 
(The property of the inverse operator) The operator 8 has the inverse operator
8-1 : П*xT* ^ T* and8(t, 8-1 (т, t)) = t.Moreover,if (T1, u), (T2, u) e D8 
with T1 <T2, then 8-1(T1,u) > 8-1(T2,u).
(P3) 
(Existence of identity element) en* e In* and 8(en*, t) = t for any t e T*,
where en* is the identity element in П*.
(P4) 
(Bridge condition) For any т 1 ,т2 e In* and t e T*, the following holds:
8(8(т 1, т2), t) = 8(т 1, 8(т2, t)) = 8(т2, 8(т 1, t)).
Then the operator 8(s, t) associated with en* e П* is said to be a shift operator 
on the set T*. The variable s e In* in 8 is called the shift size. The value 8(s, t) in 
T* indicates s units shift of the term t e T* .ThesetD8 is the domain of the shift 
operator 8.
Example 3.4.3 According to Definition 3.13, we provide a matching among In*, 8 
and 8 for the following time scales:
(1) Let T = -qZ = { - qn : q > 1, n e Z}. For such a time scale, take en* = 1; 
we attach the shift operators
8(s,t) = 
8 (s 1 ,s 2) = s 1 • s 2
s
and In* = {qn : q > 1, n e Z+} U {1}.
(2) Let T = qZ = {qn : q > 1, n e Z} U {0}. For this time scale, take en* = 1; 
we attach the shift operators
8(s, t) = st, 8(s 1 ,s2) = s 1 • s2
and In* = {qn : q > 1, n e Z+} U {1}.
(3) Let T = (-q)Z = {(-q)n : q > 1, n e Z} U {0}. For such a time scale and 
any t e T*, take en* = 1; we attach the shift operators
8(s, t) =
st, t > 0,
ls, t < 0,
8(s 1, s2) = s 1 • s2
and In* = {(-q)2n : q > 1, n e Z+} U {1}.
(4) Consider T = -qZ U qZ = {qn : q > 1, n e Z} U { - qn : q > 1, n e 
Z U {0}. For this time scale and any t e T*, take en* = 1; we equip the shift 
operators

3.4 The Matched Space of Time Scales and Shift Invariance
213
S(s, t) =
st, t > 0, 
t, t < 0,
S(s 1, s2) = s 1 • s2
and In* = {qn : q > 1, n e Z+} U {1}.
1
(5) Consider N± = { ± ^n, n e N}. For any t e T*, take en* = 0; we attach the 
shift operators
t/t2 + s2, t > 0,
—V t2 — s2, t < 0,
S(s, t) =
s12 + s22 ,s1 > 0
s12 + s22 , s1 < 0
1
and In* = N+ = {y« : n e N}.
□
In the next example, one will see that the condition (P2) from Definition 3.13 
implies that the existence of the inverse operator does not mean the existence of the 
inverse element in In*.
Example 3.4.4 Let T1 = {qn : q > 1, n e Z+} and T2 = {qn : q > 1, n e Z-}. 
For these two time scales, П 1 = T1, П2 = T2. Denote the adjoint mapping between 
T1 and In* by F 1, and the mapping between T2 and In* by F2; then we obtain 
F 1 = F2 = I, where I is an identity mapping. Take en* = 1 and In** = qqn : q > 
1, n e Z+J U {1}, In■ = {qn : q > 1, n e Z-} U {1}, 31 = S2 = s 1 s2.
It is clear that for any s 1 e In**, s2 e In**, we obtain S 1 (s 1, 11) = s 111 e T* 
for all 11 e T* but s—1 e IП*\{1}, which implies that S 1 (s—1, 11) = s1 e T* for 
t1 = q, s1 = q 2. However,
S—1 (s 1, S 1 (s 1, t)) = S—1 (s 1, s 1t) = — = t. 
s1
Similarly, S2 (s2 ,t2) = s212 e T2 for all 12 e T2 but s —1 e In*■\{1), which 
implies that S2 (s —1, 12) = e T* for 12 = 1, s2 = q2. However,
S — 1(s2, S 2 (s2, t)) = S —1 (s2, s21 ) = s2- = t.
Hence, under the shift operators S1(s, t) = S2(s, t) = st, one may see that T1 and 
T2 are completely closed. However, all the elements from In*»\{1} and Iщ=\{1} have 
no corresponding inverse elements in In** and In**, respectively, that is, (In*►, 31) 
and (In*, H2) are not Abelian groups but they can guarantee the complete closedness 
of time scales T1 and T2. 
□

214
3 Shift Invariance and Matched Spaces of Time Scales
Remark 3.16 From the condition (P2) in Definition 3.13, we note that if (П*, Si) is 
an Abelian group, then S(t-1, t) = S-1 (t, t).
3.5 Singularity of Time Scales Under Action of Shift
Operators 3 and 3-1
In this section, we will introduce a notion called the “singularity of time scales.” 
Now we assume that S(s, •) := Ss(•) be a general forward shift operator and 
S-1 (s, •) := S-1 (•) be a general backward shift operator, where s denotes the shift 
size.
Definition 3.14 The point ш* is called the singularity of the time scale T under the 
action of the shift operators Ss(•) and S-1 (•) if for any t < ш* and any shift size s, 
we have Ss(t) e ш +; or for any t > ш* and any shift size s, we have S-1 (t) e ш-, 
where ш+* and ш-* denote the right and the left neighborhoods of ш*, respectively.
Example 3.5.1 Consider T = {qn : q> 1 ,n e Z} U { - qn : q> 1 ,n e Z} U{0}. 
For such a time scale, for any t e T*, take en* = 1; we attach the shift operators
S(s, t) =
st, t > 0, 
t, t < 0’
S-1(s,t) =
t, t > 0’ 
st, t < 0.
Hence, S(q, t), S-1(q, t) e T* for all t e T*. However, for t<0 and any shift size 
s, we have S(s, t) e 0+; and for t>0, and any shift size s, we have S-1(s, t) e 0-, 
so the origin t = 0 is a singularity of the time scale under S and S-1. 
□

Example 3.5.2 Consider N± = { ± Vn, n e N}. For such a time scale, for any 
t e T*, take en* = 0; we attach the shift operators
Vs2 + t2, t > 0, S-1 (s t) = ^t2 - s2 ’ t > 0’ 
-Vt2 - s2, t < 0, 
-Vt2 + s2, t < 0.
Now we have S-1 (s, t) e 0- for all t e (0, |s|]T* and S(s, t) e 0+ for all 
t e [-|s|, 0)T*. Hence, 0 is a singularity of the time scale for this assigned shift 
operators. 
□
Remark 3.17 Note that if a time scale has a singularity ш* under the action of the 
shift operators S and S-1, one can obviously observe that the point t will collapse 
into the singularity under the shift operators with the shift size s (see Fig. 3.2).
The following result is immediate:

Theorem 3.7 The subsets of time scales located on the two sides of the singularity 
cannot cross each other under the action of the shift operators 8 and 8 -1 with any 
shift size s.
According to Theorem 3.7, the following corollary is immediate:
Corollary 3.5 The time scales will never coincide with itself under the assigned 
shift operators 8 and 8-1 if it has a singularity for the assigned shift operators.
By Corollary 3.5, the following corollaries are immediate:
Corollary 3.6 The time scales which are invariant under the shift operators 8 and 
8 -1 have no singularity.
Remark 3.18 By taking 8(t, t) = t + т and 8-1 (t, t) = t — т, the classical periodic 
time scales (i.e., the time scales with translation invariance (see [202])) have no 
singularity.
The next corollary follows from Corollaries 3.5 and 3.6 immediately.
Corollary 3.7 The time scales are invariant under shift operators 8 and 8—1 if and 
only if it has no singularity for the assigned shift operators.
Remark 3.19 Through Examples 3.5.1 and 3.5.2, the shift operators 8 and 8—1 are 
discontinuous at the singularity, which implies that the shift operators 8 and 8—1 are 
not A-differentiable at the singularity.
The following theorem follows according to Remark 3.19:
Theorem 3.8 If the shift operator 8—1 (s, •) (or 8(s, •)) is A-differentiable at t on 
the subset T of the time scale, then the set T has no singularity along the shift 
8 — 1 (s, •) (or 8(s, •)).
Remark 3.20 Notice that if one assumes that the shift operator 8— 1 (s, •) (or 8(s, •)) 
is A -differentiable at t e T, it actually defaults that T has no singularity along the 
shift 8— 1 (s, •) (or 8(s, •)).
Next, we will introduce a notion of “8-well shift” with respect to the shift 
operators 8 and 8—1.
Denote О(ш*, e) the e-neighborhood of the singularity ш* and

216
3 Shift Invariance and Matched Spaces of Time Scales
S-1 := {a-1 (s,t) :Vt e T*};
Ss := {S(s,t) : Vt e T*}.
Definition 3.15 We say T* is a a-well shift with respect to the shift operator 
S-1 (s, •) (or S(s, •)) if for any e > 0, one has О(ы*, e) A S-1 = 0 (or O(oj*, e) A 
Ss = 0).
By Definition 3.15, the following result is immediate and basic.
Theorem 3.9 If T* is a S-well shift with respect to the shift operator S -1 (s, •) (or 
S(s, •)), then the set S-1 (or Ss) has no singularity during the shift S-1 (s, •) (or 
S(s, •)).
To determine the set of a S-well shift with respect to the shift operators, we need 
the following definitions:
First, we give some necessary notations. Let T c T* .Denote the set
FTep := {s e R : S(s, t) e T*, Vt e T}, s% := infFTtep;
and
BTtep := {s e R : S-1 (s, t) e T*, Vt e T}, s0B := sup BTtep.
Definition 3.16 We say the number s0F (or s0B ) is the smallest forward step size 
(or the smallest backward step size) if T is a S-well shift with respect to the shift 
operator S(s, •) (or S-1 (s, •)).
By Definition 3.16, we have the following theorem:
Theorem 3.10 If T is a S-well shift with respect to the shift operator S-1 (s, •) (or 
S(s, •)), then the set T' := {s e T : s < sB} or (T' := {s e T : s > sF}) is a 
S-well shift with respect to the shift operator S(s, •) (or S-1 (s, •)).
Proof According to Definition 3.16 and Theorem 3.9, the result is obvious. □
Remark 3.21 Theorem 3.10 demonstrates that a S-well shift can be equivalently 
described by both shift operators S-1 (s, •) and S(s, •) simultaneously. By arbitrarily 
choosing one of these two shift operators, one can equivalently depict the same S­
well shift.
Remark 3.22 According to Theorem 3.10, we know that if T is a well shift with 
respect to the shift operator S-1 (s, •) (or S(s, •)), the set T := {s e T : s > sB3}

(or T" := {s e T : s < s0F}) collapses into a singularity. For convenience of our 
future use, let X be a Banach space; we stipulate the function value of f : T" ^ X 
as follows:
f (S(s, t)) := f(t) (or f (3-1 (s, t)) := f(t)) for all t e T".
3.6 Singularity Avoiding: A Shift with Direction
In order to include the cases of the closedness of time scales from Example 3.4.4 
and avoid the singularity under the shift operators, we introduce some concepts of 
shifts with directions.
Definition 3.17 To avoid singularity of time scales, we introduce three types of 
shift operators:
(1) We say S is a positively directional shift operator if for any p > en* and p e 
П*, there exists a number P > p and P e П* such that S(P, t) e T* for all 
t eT*.
(2) We say S-1 is a negatively directional shift operator if for any q < en* and 
q e П*, there exists a number Q < q and Q e П* such that S-1 (Q, t) e T* 
for all t e T* .
(3) We say S is a bi-directional shift operator if for any p > en* and q < en*, 
where p, q e П*, there exists two numbers P > p, Q < q and P, Q e П* 
such that S(P, t), S-1(Q, t) e T* for all t e T*.
(4) We say S is an oriented-directional shift operator if S is a positively directional 
shift operator or a negatively directional shift operator.
Remark 3.23 Under Definition 3.17, the complete closedness of time scales in 
Example 3.4.4 can be well described, that is, S for T1 is positively directional 
shift operator and S for T2 is negatively directional shift operator. Under the shifts 
controlled by S, the shift of the time scale can avoid the singularity successfully. 
However, no singularity under the shifts controlled by S does not mean no 
singularity under the shifts controlled by S-1. Moreover, all the shifts under the 
operators S in Example 3.4.3 have singularities (see Figs. 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5). Also, 
we notice that the pair (П*, Si) in Example 3.4.3 (3),(4),(5) and Example 3.4.4 is 
not Abelian group; thus there does not exist the inverse element т -1 e П* such that 
S-1 (T,t) = ST—1 (t) for all t e T*.
Remark 3.24 From Definition 3.17 (3), the shift under a bi-directional shift operator 
will never encounter a singularity during the shift process, which implies that there 
exists the inverse element т-1 such that S-1 (т, t) = ST—1 (t).

Remark 3.25 According to Definition 3.17, we will derive the following related 
concepts, which indicates that the shifts of time scales under the operator 8 include 
the cases of the translations of time scales.
(i) If T = R, then 8(s, t) = t + s, where s e In* = R+ and 8(s 1, s2) = s 1 + s2. 
Note that (П*, 8) forms an Abelian group; then we obtain 8 is a bi-directional 
shift operator.
(ii) If T = hZ, h > 0, then 8(s, t) = t + s, wheres e In* = hZ+ and 8(s 1, s2) = 
s1 + s2. Also, we easily obtain 8 is a bi-directional shift operator because 
(П*, 8) forms an Abelian group.
(iii) If T = U +=0[2k, 2k + 1],then 8(s,t) = t+s, where s e In* = {2n, n e N+} 
and 88(s1, s2) = s1 + s2. Since the time scale under the shift 8-1 (s, t) = t - s 
has a singularity 0, we get 8 is a positively directional shift operator.
According to Definition 3.17, the following theorem is immediate:
Theorem 3.11 If the time scale has no singularity under the shift 8(or 8-1) with 
respect to In*, then the shift 8 (or 8-1) is with positive direction (or negative 
direction). If the time scale has no singularity under the shift 8 and 8-1 with respect 
to In*, then the shift 8 and 8-1 are bi-directional with 8-1 (t) = 8T-1 (t) for t e T*.
In the literature [180, 202], the authors proposed the concept of time scales 
attached with translation direction to discuss the closedness of time scales under 
translations. In this section, one can observe that the translation of time scales is just 
a particular case of the shift of time scales. Hence, it is significant to consider the

3.6 Singularity Avoiding: A Shift with Direction
219
closedness of time scales under shifts because not only can it unify the discrete and 
continuous time scales (i.e., T = hZ or R) but also the quantum time scale (i.e., 
__  
_____ 1
T = qZ) and other irregular types of time scales such as (-q)Z, N±, etc.
For convenience, we introduce the following concepts of semigroup of П* 
attached with shift direction.
Definition 3.18 Let (П*, S) be an Abelian group and
Я
** 
* 
** 
*
1 := 5 € П : s < en* , П2 := s € П : s > en* .
Then the sets П* and П** are called the negatively directional semigroup and the 
positively directional semigroup for П*, respectively.
According to Definition 3.18, the following theorem is immediate:
Theorem 3.12 If the time scale has no singularity under the shift 3-1 (or 3) with 
respect to П* or П**, then S-1 is a negatively directional shift operator (or S is a 
positively directional shift operator).
From Definition 3.13, we introduce the concept of matched spaces for time scales 
and establish some related properties.
Definition 3.19 Let the pair (П* ,S) satisfy Definition 3.7 and П*, T* be the 
largest (open) subsets of the time scales П and T, respectively. Further, let In* be 
an adjoint set of T* and F the adjoint mapping between T* and In*. If there exists 
the shift operator S satisfying Definition 3.13, then we say the group (T, In*, F, S) 
is a matched space of the time scale T.
Remark 3.26 Note that Definition 3.19 reflects the algebraic structure of matched 
spaces, i.e., a matched space for the time scale is the group (T, In*, F, S).
Definition 3.20 If T э In*, then we say the group (T, In*, F,S) is a standard 
matched space.
Remark 3.27 Notice that for a standard matched space, the adjoint mapping F is 
a mapping onto itself. Under the standard matched space (T, In*, F, S), one can 
employ the algebraic structure to include all the results from [33]. In fact, let П c T, 
en* = 10, S(s, t) = S + (s, t), and S-1 (s, t) = S-(s, t), where s € [t0, +^)T* and 
t0 is an initial point; then all the results from [33] become a particular case of the 
established results in this section.
Lemma 3.2 Let S be a shift operator under Definition 3.13. Then the following 
properties are fulfilled:
(1) S-1 (en* ,t) = S(en* ,t) = t for all t € T*.
(2) If (s, u) € DS-1 and (s, t) € DS, then S(s, t) = u implies S-1 (s, u) = t and 
S-1 (s, u) = t implies S(s, t) = u.

(3) 3(т,3-1 (s,tо)) = 3-1(s,3(t,tо)) for any 1о e T*.
(4) 3(3(u, s), 3-1 (s, v)) = 3(u, v); 3-1 (3(u, s), 3(s, v)) = 3-1 (u, v).
(5) If 3(t, •) is A-differentiable in its second variable, then 3А(т, •) > 0.
Proof
(1) Since 3-1 (en*, t) = 3(еП1, t) = 3(en*, t) for all t e T*, the desired result 
follows.
(2) If (s, u) e :/3-1 and (s, t) e :/3, then
3-1 (s, u) = 3-1 (s, 3(s, t)) = t,
and
3(s,t) = 3(s, 3-1 (s, u)) = u.
(3) We directly calculate that
1 
1/ 
11 
1 1
(т, 3 (s,t0)) = 3 
(s, 3(s, 3(r,3 (s,t0))))
= 3-1(s, 3 (т, 3 (s, 3-1 (s, tо))))
= 3-1(s, 3(т, tо)).
(4) Through calculation, we obtain
3(3(u, s), 3-1 (s, v)) = 3(u, 3(s, 3-1 (s, v))) = 3(u, v)
and
3-1(3(u, s), 3(s, v)) = 3(s, 3-1 (3(u, s), v))) 
= 3(s, 3-1 (s, 3-1 (u, v))) 
= 3-1 (u, v).
(5) Since 3(т, •) is strictly increasing in its second variable, we have (5) by 
Corollary 1.16 from [61]. This completes the proof.
□
Corollary 3.8 Let T* be the largest (open) subset of the time scale T. For a 
standard matched space (T, In*, F, 3), 3(т, t) = 3(t, т) holds for all (т, t) e 
I n * X I n *.
Proof Note that
3(т, t) = 3(t, 3-1(t, 3(т, t))) = 3(t, 3(т, 3-1 (t, t)))

= 8(t, 8(t, en*)) = 8(t, t).
This completes the proof.
□
Next, we provide several examples to show the algebraic structure of matched 
spaces for time scales.
Example 3. 6.1
(1) T = {±n2 : n e Z}, In* = {t : t = n, n e Z+} U {0}, and thus the shift 
operator 8 can be taken as follows:
(J Vt + t )4,
-(у V-t ~^)4,
({t, t) =
if t ^ 0 ’ к
t e I n * ■ 
if t < 0■
Thus, Vt 1, t2 e In*, 8(t 1, t2) = t 1 + t2. Obviously, 8(t 1, t2) e In*. On the 
other hand, there exists a surjective mapping
F :
T*
^
I n *
A e { ± n2 : n e Z} ^ B e {n : n e Z+}
A ^ У|А| = B,
i.e., F(A) = ViAT. Hence, we obtain a matched space (T, In*, F, 8) of the 
time scale T.
(2) T = qZ and In* = {qn : q > 1, n e Z+} U {1}■ 8(r, t) = Tt, t = qn0, Vn0 e 
Z+. Thus, V t 1, t2 e I n *, 8 (t 1, t2) = t 1 • t2. Obviously, 8 (t 1, t2) e I n * .On the 
other hand, there exists a surjective mapping
F : 
T* 
^ 
In *
A e {qn, n e Z} ^ B e {qn, n e Z+} U {1}
A
^ B =
A, 0 < A < 1,
A, A > 1,
Hence, we obtain a matched space (T, In*, F, 8) of the time scale T.
(3) T = Unez[22n, 22n+1] and In* = {t : t = 22n, n e Z+} U {1}■ 8(r, t) = Tt, 
t = 22n0, Vn0 e Z+. Thus, Vt 1, t2 e In*, 3(t 1, t2) = t 1 • t2. Obviously, 
3(t 1, t2) e In*. On the other hand, there exists a surjective mapping
F : 
T* 
^ 
In *
A e Unsz[22n, 22n +1] ^ B e {t : t = 22n, n e Z+}
A 
^ the left point of the interval A,

222
3 Shift Invariance and Matched Spaces of Time Scales
i.e., F (A) = B. Hence, we establish a matched space (T, IП*, F, 8) for T.
(4) T = {i+q-qn : q > 1 is a constant and n e Z} U {0, 1} and IП* = {т : т = 
qn, n e Z+} U {1}. Thus, the shift operators can be as follows:
8(т, t)
q inq (ln 1—7+ln т)
1 + q E1q(ln 1—7 +ln т)
т = qn0, Vnо e Z+.
Thus, we obtain 8 (т 1, т2) = т 1 • т2. Obviously, 8 (т 1, т2) e IП*. On the other 
hand, there exists a surjective mapping
F : 
T 
■ 
I П *

A e

q>1 is a constant and n e Z
■ B e {т : т = qn, n e Z+} U {1}
A 
■ 
q | logq 1—A |= B,
i.e., F (A) = B. Hence, we obtain a matched space (T, IП*, F, 8) of T.
(5) If T = Ukez[k(a + b), k(a + b) + b], where a = — b and IП* = {т : т = 
n(a + b), n e Z+} U {0}. 8(r, t) = t + т, т = n о (a + b), V n о e Z+. Then, 
we obtain 8(т 1, т2) = т 1 + т2. Obviously, 8(т 1, т2) e IП*. On the other hand, 
there exists a surjective mapping
F :

■ B e {т : т = n(a + b), n e Z}
A 
■ the absolute value of the left point of the interval A,
i.e., F(A) = B. Hence, a matched space (T, In*, F, 8) of T follows. □
Using the algebraic structure of matched spaces, we introduce the following new 
concept of periodic time scales.
Definition 3.21 A time scale T is called a periodic time scale under a matched 
space (T, In*, F, 8) if
П := {т e П* : (т, t) e Ds, Ds—1, Vt e T*} g {{en*}, 0}. 
(3.8)
Remark 3.28 From Definition 3.21, one notes that П с П* с П and for every 
т e П, there exists т—1 e П, i.e., there exists an inverse element for every element 

3.6 Singularity Avoiding: A Shift with Direction
223
in f. In fact, from 3 1 (t, t) e D3-1, we know 3 1 (t, t) e T* for any t e T*; 
according to Remark 3.24, there exists т-1 e fl such that 3-1 (т, t) = 8(r-1, t).
Remark 3.29 For any t e T*, if (t2, t) e D3, (t1,t) e D3, then by Definition 3.13, 
there exists a function 3 : If * x If * ^ If * such that 3(т 1, т2) e If *. Obviously, 
if T is a periodic time scale in the sense of Definition 1.21, i.e., ef * = 0 and 
f = {т e R+ = If * : t + т e D3, D3-1, Vt e T} £ {{0}, 0], we have т 1, т2 e f; 
then 33(t1 ,t2) = t1 + t2 e П3 .
Remark 3.30 From (3.8), one can see (т, t) e D3, D3-1 for all t e T* implies that 
3(т-1, t) = 3-1(т, t) exists.
In the following, we present some periodic time scales in the sense of Defini­
tion 3.21.
Example 3. 6.2 In Example
, we obtain the operators 3 as follows: 
 3.6.1
(1)
(V(Vt +т)), 
- (V V- -t)4,
3(т, t) =
if t>0, т = 1, 
if t<0, т = 1.
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
T = qZ, 3(т, t) = nt, т = q.
T = UneZ[22n, 22n +1], 3(т, t) = rt,r = 4.
3(т, t) =
„Inq(ln1-7 +ln т)
-q-- ,------ ■.------ .
1+ q lnq(ln1-7 +ln т), т= q.
3(т, t) = t + т, т = a + b.
From the above and the operators 3, one obtains the above numbers т e f in (2)­
(5), but there is no inverse element т -1 in (1). Hence, (2)-(5) are periodic time scales 
under their matched spaces except (1). Furthermore, we also obtain (1), (2), (4) 
from Example 3.6.1 are not periodic time scales in the sense of Definition 1.21. □
Remark 3.31 We now show that (1), (3) in Example 3.4.2 are periodic under their 
matched spaces. However, they are not periodic in the sense of Definition 1.22. In 
fact, we note that T A f * = 0 in (1), (3) in Example 3.4.2; thus Definition 1.22 is 
not satisfied since Definition 1.22 requires f * c T. In fact, we have
(i) for (1) from Example
, let 3(т, t) = t log3 т,т= 32 e If*, and it follows 
that 3(т, t) e T* under the matched space (T, If*,F,3).
 3.4.2
(ii) for (3) from Example
, let
 3.4.2
3(т, t) = t +J V3(a + Ь)т,
a+b
т = —e^ e I f *,
V3
and it follows that 3(т, t) e T* under the matched space (T, If*,F,3).

224
3 Shift Invariance and Matched Spaces of Time Scales
In what follows, denote the shift by 8T(t) := 8(т, t), and we assume that T is 
a periodic time scale under its matched space (T, In*, F, 8). We will show that 
8T : T* ^ T* are commutative with the forward jump operator a : T ^ T given 
by a(t) := inf{s e T : s > t}, that is,
(8т ◦ a)(t) = (a ◦ 8T)(t). 
(3.9)
Lemma 3.3 The operator 8T : T* ^ T* preserves the structure of the points in 
T*. That is,
a(t*) = t > a(8r(t*)) = 8r(t*),
a(t * )>t *> a (8r(t *)) >8r(t *).
Proof Since a(t) > t for all t e T*, thus, by (P 1) from Definition 3.13, we obtain 
8T{a(t) > 8T(t). Since a(8T(t)) is the smallest element satisfying a(8T(t)) > 
8T(t), we obtain
8T (a(t)) > a (8T(t)) for all t e T*. 
(3.10)
If a(t*) = t*, then (3.10) implies 8T(t*) = 8T(a(t*)). That is, 8T(t*) = 
a (8T(t*)).
If a(t*) > t*, then by definition of a, we have
(t*,a(t*)) П T* = 0 
(3.11)
and by (P 1) from Definition 3.13, 8T(a(t*)) > 8T(t*). For contradiction, assume 
that 8T(t*) is right-dense, i.e., a(8T(t*)) = 8T(t*), and it follows from (3.10) that 
(8T(t*), 8T(a(t*))) П T* = 0. Pick one element s e (8T(t*), 8T(a(t*))) П T*, 
and since 8T(t) is strictly increasing in t, we obtain 8-1 (s) e (t*, a(t*)) П T*, 
which contradicts (3.11). Therefore, 8T(t *) must be right-scattered, i.e., a(8T(t *)) > 
8T (t *). This completes the proof. 
□
Corollary 3.9 For all t e T*, the following are fulfilled:
8r (a(t)) = a (8r(t)); 
(3.12)
8-1(a(t)) = a (8-1 (t)). 
(3.13)
Proof From the proof process of Lemma 3.3, we immediately obtain (3.12). By 
(3.12), we obtain that 8T(a(s)) = a(8T(s)) for all s e T*. Substituting s = 8-1 (t),

3.6 Singularity Avoiding: A Shift with Direction
225
we obtain 8т(a(8- 1 (t))) = о(8т(8- 1 (t))), and it follows from (2) in Lemma 3.2 
that 8-1(o(t)) = о (8-1 (t)) for all t e T*. This completes the proof. 
□
Observe that (3.12) along with (3.13) yields (3.9).
In the following, according to Definition 3.17, one can also introduce the concept 
of matched spaces of time scales under shift operators attached with the shift 
directions.
Definition 3.22 Let the pair (П*, 8) be closed toward the operation 8, and П*, T* 
be the largest (open) subsets of the time scales П and T, respectively. Further, let 
In* be an adjoint set of T* and F the adjoint mapping between T* and In*. If there 
exists the shift operator 8 or 8-1 satisfying Definition 3.17, then we say the group 
(T, In*, F, 8) is a matched space attached with the shift direction for T, i.e., one 
can describe it as follows:
(i) if 8 is a bi-directional shift operator, then we say (T, In*, F, 8) is a bi­
directional matched space;
(ii) if 8 is a positively directional shift operator, then we say (T, In*, F, 8) is a 
positively directional matched space;
(iii) if 8-1 is a negatively directional shift operator, then we say (T, In*, F, 8) is a 
negatively directional matched space;
(iv) a positively directional or negatively directional matched space is called an 
oriented-directional matched space .
Remark 3.32 Note that the matched space (T, In*, F,8) established in the sense of 
Definition 3.21 is the bi-directional matched space since 8 is the bi-directional shift 
operator.
Definition 3.23 Under Definition 3.22, a time scale T is called the complete-closed 
time scale under a matched space (T, In*, F, 8) attached with the shift direction if
П1 := {e e In* : (т, t) e D&, Vt e T*} £ {{en*}, 0};
fl2 := {т e In* : (т, t) e Ds-1, Vt e T*} £ {{en*}, 0};
fl3 := {т e In* : (т, t) e D&, D&-1, Vt e T*} £ {{en*}, 0}•
Moreover,
(i) if fl 1 e {{en*}, 0, then we say T is a positively directional complete-closed 
time scale;
(ii) if П2 e {{en*}, 0, then we say T is a negatively directional complete-closed 
time scale;

226
3 Shift Invariance and Matched Spaces of Time Scales
(iii) if П3 g {{en*}, 0}, then we say T is a bi-directional complete-closed time 
scale;
(iv) a positively directional or negatively directional complete-closed time scale is 
called an oriented-directional complete-closed time scale.
Remark 3.33 For Example 3.4.4, according to Definition 3.23, it follows that T1 
is a positively directional complete-closed time scale under the matched space 
(T1, IП1», F 1, S 1), and T2 is a negatively directional complete-closed time scale 
under the matched space (T2, IП--, F2, S2). Moreover, a bi-directional complete- 
closed time scale is actually equivalent to a periodic time scale under Defini­
tion 3.21.
Remark 3.34 In Definition 3.23, one will observe that П 1 is a positively directional 
semigroup and П2 is a negatively directional semigroup according to Defini­
tion 3.18.

Chapter 4
Almost Periodic Functions Under
Matched Spaces of Time Scales
This chapter is mainly devoted to establish a theory of almost periodic functions 
through the theory of matched spaces of time scales. In Sect. 4.1, we present some 
basic notions and properties of periodic functions under the complete-closed time 
scales in shifts. In Sect. 4.2, a theory of S-almost periodic functions under matched 
spaces is developed. In Sect. 4.3, a notion of S-almost periodic stochastic process 
in shift operators is addressed and some basic results are presented. In Sect. 4.4, a 
generalized notion of S-almost periodic functions called n0-order A-almost periodic 
functions is proposed and investigated.
4.1 Periodic Functions Under Complete-Closed Time Scales 
in Shifts
Definition 4.1 Let T be a periodic time scale under the matched space 
(T, In*, F, S) and X be a Banach space; we say f : T* ^ X is periodic under 
(T, In*, F, S) if there exists a т e In* such that
(т±1 ,t) e DS and f (ST±1 (t)) = f(t) for all t e T*. 
(4.1)
The number т such that (4.1) holds is called the period of f.
Example 4.1.1 Let T = R and In* = [1, +^); we define the following operators:
Sr(t) =
Tt,
t/T,
if t > 0, 
if t<0,
for т e In *,

and it is clear that (T, In*, F, 3) is a matched space of T, where
F(A) = A, A <0,
1 + A, A > 0,
for all A e T* = R\{0}, In* = [1, +^). By Definition 4.1, we know that the set 
of reals R is periodic under the matched space (T, In*, F, 3). The function

Example 4.1.2 The time scale qZ = [qn : q > 1 ,n e Z} U {0} is periodic under 
the matched space (T, In*, F, 3) with period т = q4. The function defined by 
f(t) = [0(t)]lnq, 0(t) =

for all t e qZ. However, f is not periodic in the sense of Definition 1.21 since there 
is no positive number т such that f (t ± т) = f(t) holds. 
□
In the following, we introduce the concept of Л -periodic function under the 
matched space (T, In*, F, 3).
Definition 4.2 Let T be a periodic time scale under the matched space 
(T, In*, F, 3) and X be a Banach space. We say that a function f : T* ^ X 

4.1 Periodic Functions Under Complete-Closed Time Scales in Shifts
229
is Л-periodic if there exists a т e П* such that
(т±1, t) e Dg for all t e T*,
and the shifts 8т±1 are Л-differentiable with rd-continuous derivatives and
f (8r ±1 (t)) ЗтЛ±1 (t) = f(t)
for all t e T*. The number т is called the period of f.
Example 4.1.3 For any a e R\{0}, the real-valued function f(t) = a/t defined on 
5Z = {5n, n e Z} is Л-periodic under the matched space (T, In*, F, 8) with the 
period т = 5 since
f (85±1 (t))85Л±1 (t) = 5- 5± = a- = f(t).
Theorem 4.1 Let T be a periodic function under the matched space (T, I n *, F, 8') 
and f a Л-periodic function with period т e I n *. Assume that f e Crd( T). Then
f t f{s}As = f8±1(t) f(№. 
t0 
8т±1 (t0)
Proof From Theorem 1.98 in [61], substituting v(s) = 8T(s) and g(s) = f (8T(s)), 
we obtain
ISr(t) f(.s)^s = IV(t) g(v-1 (s))Лs = I‘g^fAs

can be obtained similarly. The proof is completed. 
□
Remark 4.1 From Definition 4.1, if the time scale is in the sense of Definition 1.21, 
then we obtain /tQ±TT f^'^s = f f^'^s by taking 8т±1 (t) = t ± т.

4.2 3-Almost Periodic Functions Under Matched Spaces
For any т e П*, we define a function A : П* ^ П*,
A(t) =
S(r,en*), т > en*, 
3—1 (т, en*), т < en*,
which will be used in the later section.
Under the matched space (T, F, In*, S'), for convenience, we denote Ait the sub­
timescale which the argument t belongs to, obviously, it e I1, where I1 is an index 
set satisfying T = UieI 1 Ai•
From the singularity theory established in Sect. 3.5, noticing that the shift 
direction under the shift operators 3 and 3-1 is opposite, the shift direction we 
choose to consider in the concept of almost periodic approximation is equivalent. 
If we extend the shift operators at the singularity of time scales according to 
Remark 3.22, the influence of the singularity can be ignored under the shift operator 
3 and 3-1 when the shift of the point t collapses into a singularity. In this way, the 
function values at each point can be compared with the function values at the point 
after the shift size s regardless of whether the time scale shifts to the left or to the 
right direction. For convenience, if the shift operator is A-differentiable to its second 
variable, we can choose C3 that equals to 3 or 3-1 such that the derivative function 
of the shift operator C S we choose has an upper bound CB.
Remark 4.2 For a shift operator S that is A -differentiable to its second variable, 
noting that 3 and 3 -1 are inverse functions to each other, thus by derivative rule for 
inverses, if the 8л(т, •) is infinite, then [S—1 (т, •)]& is bounded. Hence, there is an 
upper bound CSg for CS.
Definition 4.3 If the adjoint mapping F : T* ^ In* is piecewise continuous and
(1) is a piecewise one-to-one mapping, i.e., T = Ui F—1 (F(Ai)) = Ui Ai,
(2) for any т e In*, t0 e T*, F (Sr(t0)) = S'(т, F(Ait0)) holds, 
(3) for 11 ,t2 e T, if 11 < 12, then F(A 1) < F(A2).
We say (T, F, In*, S') a regular matched space of the time scale T (see Fig. 4.1).
In this section, we introduce some new concepts of almost periodic functions 
under the matched space (T, In*, F, S') and establish some basic results.
For convenience, we will use these symbols throughout the section. En denotes 
Rn or Cn, D denotes an open set in En or D = En , and S denotes an arbitrary 
compact subset of D.
Definition 4.4 Let T be a periodic time scale under the matched space 
(T, In*, F, S). A function f e C(T x D, X) is called S-almost periodic function 
with shift operators in t e T uniformly for x e D if the e-shift set of f

Fig. 4.1 The mapping 
relation of a regular matched 
space
E{e, f, S} = {т e fl : || f (8T±1 (t), x) — f (t, x) || < e, for all t e T* and x e S}
is a relatively dense set with respect to the pair (П*, 8) for all e > 0 and for each 
compact subset S of D; that is, for any given e>0 and each compact subset S of D, 
there exists a constant l(e, S) > 0 such that each interval of length l(e, S) contains 
a т(е, S') e E {e, f, S} such that
|| f (8T±1 (t), x) — f (t, x) || < e, for all t e T* and x e S.
Now т is called the e-shift number of f and l(e, S) is called the inclusion length of 
E{e, f, S}.
Definition 4.5 Let T be a periodic time scale under the matched space 
(T, In*, F, 3) and n0 e N, the shift 8T(t) is A-differentiable with rd-continuous 
derivatives 8^(t) := 8a(t, t) for all t e T*. A function f e C(T x D, X) is called 
an n0-order A-almost periodic function (An0-almost periodic function) with shift 
operators in t e T uniformly for x e D if the e-shift set of f
E{e, f,S} = {т e П : || f (8r±1 (t),x)(8A±i (t))n0 — f(t,x)\\ < e, 
for all t e T* and x e S}
is a relatively dense set with respect to the pair (П*, 8) for all e > 0 and for each 
compact subset S ofD; that is, for any given e>0 and each compact subset S ofD, 
there exists a constant l(e, S) > 0 such that each interval of length l(e, S) contains 
a T(e, S) e E {e, f, S} such that
|| f (8T±1 (t), x)(8A±i (t))n0 — f(t, x) || < e, for all t e T* and x e S. (4.4)
Now т is called the e-shift number of f and l(e, S) is called the inclusion length of 
E{e, f, S}.
In the following, we will provide an example of A81-almost periodic function.

4 Almost Periodic Functions Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
Example 4.2.1 For any a e R\{0}, the real-valued function f1 (t) = a/t defined on 
(75)Z = {(75)n, n e Z} is ^-periodic under the matched space (T, In*, F, 8) 
with the period т = 75 since
f1(8(75)±1(t))8?V5)±1(t) = 7±ft (75)±1 = a = f1 (t).
Now, let f2(t) =------l°g^t . Similarly, taking т = (75)2, we obtain
f2(8(75)±2 (t))(8(75)±2t = (-1 
(75b±21 • (75)±21 ( (75)±2
b 
b 
t /л
= (-1)±2+log75 t . t = (-1)log75 tt = f 2 (t).
Hence, we obtain F(t) = f1 (t)+f 2(t) which is a Д^-almost periodic function under 
the matched space (T, In*, F, 8). Note that the periods of f1 and f2 are completely 
different. 
□
In what follows, we introduce some notations. The set of all 8-almost periodic 
functions in shifts on T is denoted by AP8(T). Let a = {an} с fl and в = 
{вп} C fl be two sequences. Then в C a means that в is a subsequence of a; 
8(a, в) = {8(an, en)}; a-1 = {a-1}, where 8(a, a-1) = en*; a and в are common 
subsequences of a and в , respectively, which means that an = an (k) and вп = 
вп(k) for some given function n(k).
We introduce the moving operator T 8 , Ta8 f(t, x) = g(t, x) by
g(t,x) = n lm\ ffan(t),x)
only when the limit exists. The mode of convergence, e.g., pointwise, uniform, etc., 
will be specified at each use of the symbol.
In what follows, we will establish some basic properties of 8-almost periodic 
functions.
Theorem 4.2 Assume that f e C(T x D, En) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly 
for x e D under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8), and 8T(t) is continuous in t. 
Then it is uniformly continuous and bounded on T* x S.
Proof For a given e < 1 and some compact set S с D, there exists a constant 
l(e, S) such that in any interval of length l(e, S), there exists т e E {e, f, S} such 
that
|f (8T(t), x) — f (t, x)| < e < 1 for all (t, x) e T* x S.

4.2 3-Almost Periodic Functions Under Matched Spaces
233
Since f e C(T x D, En), for any (t, x) e ([10, 3(l, 10)]T) x S, 10 e T*, there exists 
a M > 0 such that | f (t, x)| < M. For any given t e T*, take т e E(e, f, S) П 
[Р(Аи),8(l,F(Ait))]fj, then 8T(t) e [3(F(Ait),t),3(8(l,F(^Ait)),t)]T, i.e., 
3T(t) e [ 3 (F(Ait),t) ,3 (l, 3(F(Ait),t ))]T. Hence, for x e S, we have
|f (3r(t),x)\<M and |f (3r(t),x) - f(t,x)\< 1.
Thus for all (t, x) e T* x S, we have | f (t, x)| < M + 1.
(
e A
-, S I be an inclusion length of
E^-, f, S^. We can fix an arbitrary point 10 e T* such that f (t, x) is uniformly 
continuous on ([t0, 3(l 1, 10)]t) x S. Hence, there exists a positive constant 3 * = 
3*(-, s), for any 11, 12 e [10, 3(l 1, 10)]T and 111 - 12| < 3*,
|f(t 1 ,x) - f(t2, x)| < 3 for all x e S.
Now, we choose an arbitrary v, t e T*, satisfying 11 — v| < 3*, and we take
т e e(3-, f, s) П [F(Ait), 3(11, F(Ait))]n,
then 3T(t), 8T(v) e [3(F(Ait), t), 3(11, 3(F(Ait), t))]T. Since 3T(t) is continuous 
in t, there exists 3** > 0 such that 11 — v | < 3** implies
13r(t) — 3r(v)| <3*.
Now, we take 3** = min {3*, 3**}, when 11 — v| < 3** implies
|f (3T(t),x) — f (3T(v),x)| < 3 for all x e S.
Therefore, for (t, x) e T* x S, we have
| f(t,x) — f(v,x)| < \f(t, x) — f (3r(t),x)| + |f (3r(t),x) — f (3r(v),x)| 
+ \f (3T (и), x) — f (v, x) I < e.
The proof is completed. 
□
In the following, we will establish a shift-convergence theorem of 3-almost 
periodic functions.

4 Almost Periodic Functions Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
Theorem 4.3 Assume that f e C( Tx D, En) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for 
x e D under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8). Then for any given sequence a c 
П, there is a subsequence в c a and g e C(T x D, En) such that Tpf(t,x) = 
g(t, x) holds uniformly on T* x S. Furthermore, g(t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t 
uniformly for x e D under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8).
£
Proof For any given e > 0 and S c D, there exists a positive constant l = l 4, S 
as an inclusion length of e||, f, s|. Since there exists тп e e||, f, s| in any 
interval with length of l, so for any subsequence a = {an} c fl, we select a suitable 
/ 
. / 
I 
I I
interval with length l such that en* < 8{an, (тп) J < l and yn = 8{an, (тп) J e 
П. Hence, there exists Tn e e||, f, s| and уП e fl with en* < yn < l,n = 
1, 2,... such that an = 8(rn, yn). Moreover, because {yn} is bounded, there exists a 
subsequence у = {yn} c у = {/„} such that yn ^ s as n ^ <x> and en* < s < l.
According to Theorem 4.2, one has f (t, x) uniformly continuous on T* x S. 
Hence, there exists 8* (e, S') > 0; when 111 - 12| <8 * we obtain
|f (8r(t 1 ),x) - f (8r(t2),x)| <2, Vx e S.
For у convergent, there exists N = N(8); when p, m > N one has |yp - ym | < 
8*. Now, one can take a c a , т c т = {Tn} such that a, т common with y, then 
for any integers p, m > N, we obtain
|f(8A7r r-U(t),^ — f(t,x)\ < |f(8-..

= 8 (Ste^y-1 ),8“1 (am,y>f1))
8(rp,r,-1) e ^2,f,sj.
Hence, we get
|f (8ap(t),x) - f (8am(t),x)|

Therefore, we select sequences с№ = {a)}}, k = 1, 2,..., and a+ +1) c a® c a 
such that
|f (0aPk)(t),x) - f (0amk)(t),x )| < 1 ,k = 1, 2,...
for any integers m, p, and all (t, x) e T* x S. Moreover, for each sequence a),, k = 
1, 2,..., we can choose a sequence в = {вп}, вп = ann,, then for any integers p, m 
with p <m, one has {f (0pn(t),x)} c {f (0an(t),x)} and
\f (0pp(t),x) - f (0pm(t),x)| < p, V(t,x) e T* x S.
Therefore, the sequence {f 0врА), x)} is convergent uniformly on T* x S, i.e., 
Tpft x) = g(t, x) holds uniformly on T* x S, where в = {вп} c a.
In the following, we will demonstrate that g(t, x) is continuous on T* x D. 
For contradiction, assume it is not true, then there will be (t0, x0) e T* x D such 
that g(t, x) is discontinuous at (t0, x0). Then there exist e0 > 0 and sequences 
{0m}, {tm},{xm}, where °m >0, 0m ^ 0 as m ^ +^>, |t0 - tm | + |x0 - xm | < °m 
and
| g(t0, x 0) - g(tm, xm) | > e 0. 
(4.5)
Let X = {xm} U{x0}. It is easy to observe that X is a compact subset of D. Hence, 
for all m e Z+, there is positive integer N = N(e0, X); when n>Nwe have
|f (0pn(tm),xm) - g(tm,xm)\ < у 
(4.6)
and
|f (0Pn(t0),x0) - g(t0,x0)|<e°. 
(4.7)
Furthermore, from the uniform continuity of f(t, x) on T* x D, there exists a 
sufficiently large m such that
\f (0pn(t0 ),x 0) - f (0pn(tm),xm )| < у.
(4.8)

236
4 Almost Periodic Functions Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
It follows from (4.6)-(4.8) that
|g(t0,x0) - g(tm,xm)| < e0,
which contradicts (4.5). Therefore, g(t, x) is continuous on T* x D.
Now, we will show E{e, g, S} is relatively dense. In fact, for any compact set 
S c D and given e > 0, we select т e E {e, f, S} such that
\f (Sen(sr(t)'),x) - f (Sen(t),x)| < e, V(t,x) e T* x S.
Letting n ^ +rc>, we obtain
|g(3r(t),x) - g(t,x)| < e, V(t,x) e T* x S,
which indicates THAT E{e, g, S} is relatively dense. Therefore, g(t, x) is 3-almost 
periodic in t uniformly for x e D under the matched space (T, F, In*, S'). This 
completes the proof. 
□
Next, we will give a sequentially compact criterion of S-almost periodic functions 
through the shift operator T S .
Theorem 4.4 Assume f e C( T x D, En). If for any sequence a c fl, there is 
a c a such that TSf(t,x) exists uniformly on T* x S, then f(t,x) is S-almost 
periodic in t uniformly for x e D under the matched space (T, F, I n *, 3).
Proof We will give the proof by contradiction. Assume it is not true, then there exist 
e0 > 0 and S c D such that for any sufficiently large l>0, there is an interval with 
the length of l in which there are no e0-shift numbers of f (t, x), that is, there is no 
intersection between the whole interval and E{e0, f, S}.
Now we select a number a1 e 77 and an interval (a 1, b 1) with b 1 - a 1 > 
2|a1| and a 1 ,b 1 e fl so that there are no e0-shift numbers of f(t,x) in this 
interval. Then, choosing a 2 e (3 (a1 ,a 1), <S (a1 ,b 1 ^, it is easy to observe that 
S a2, (a1)-1 e (a1, b1), and we obtain S a2, (a1)-1 e E{e0, f, S}. Next, we 
can choose an interval (a2, b2) with b2 - a2 > 2(|a11 + |a2|) and a2, b2 e fl
such that there are no e0-shift numbers of f(t, x) in this interval. Then, selecting 
a3 e (3(a2, a2), 3(a2,, b2)) П (3(a1, a2), 3(a1, b2)), we note that

Therefore, there is no uniformly convergent subsequence of {f(3a/ (t),x)} for 
(t, x} e T* x S, which is a contradiction. Therefore, f(t, x) is 3-almost periodic in 
t uniformly for x e D under the matched space (T, F, In*, 3). This completes the 
proof. 
□
From Theorems 4.3 and 4.4, we obtain the following equivalent definition of 
uniformly 3-almost periodic functions.
Definition 4.6 Assume f e C(T x D, En). If for any given sequence a c fl, 
there exists a subsequence a c a such that T3f(t, x) exists uniformly on T* x S, 
then f(t, x) is said to be a 3-almost periodic function in t uniformly for x e D 
under the matched space (T, F, In* ,3').
Theorem 4.5 Assume that f e C(T x D, En) is 3-almost periodic in t uniformly 
for x e D and w(t) is 3-almostperiodic with {w(t) : t e T} c S, then f(t, w(t) is 
3 -almost periodic.
Proof For any given sequence a c fl, there exists a c a , ^(t), g(t, x) such that 
T3w(t) = '^(t) exists uniformly on T* and T3f(t,x) = g(t,x) exists uniformly 
on T* x S, where ^(t) is 3-almost periodic and g(t, x) is 3-almost periodic in t
uniformly for x e D. Therefore, g(t, x) is uniformly continuous on T* x S, then
for any given e > 0, there exists 3*

Note that

thus, Tf (t, w(t)) = g(t, ^(t)) exists uniformly on T* x S. Thus, f (t, p(t)) is 
S-almost periodic under the matched space (T, F, In* ,S). The proof is completed.

Definition 4.7 Let f e C(T x D, En). Then HS(f) = {g(t, x) : T u En| there is 
a e П such that 'f; f(t, x) = g(t, x) exists uniformly on T* x S } is said to be the 
S-hull of f (t, x) under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8).
Theorem 4.6 HS (f) is compact if and only if f(t, x) is S-almost periodic in t 
uniformly for x e D.
Proof If HS(f) is compact, for any given a = {an} c fl, there must exist 
subsequence {f (Sank (t), x)}keN of the sequence {f (Sa(t), x)}neN such that
f (Sank (t), x) u g(t, x) (k u oo), V(t, x) e T* x S.
Noting that a = {ank}, obviously, a c a , so T8f(t, x) exists uniformly on T* x S. 
Conversely, if f(t,x) is S-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D and
{gn(t, x)} c HS(f), then we choose a = {an} such that

We can find a c a so that T8f(t, x) exists uniformly. Let в C y = {n} such that

so that
nUm gpn(t, x) = T8f(t, x) e Hs(f ), V(t, x) e T* x S,
and thus, HS(f) is compact. The proof is completed.

Theorem 4.7 If f(t, x) is S-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D under the

Proof For any h(t, x) e HS(g) there exists a c П such that TS,g(t, x) = h(t, x). 
Since f(t, x) is S-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D, from the sequence

and then we can take в = {вп} = {3(an , an)} such that

It follows that Tf(t,x) = T3g(t,x) = T3g(t,x) = h(t,x). Hence h(t,x) e 
H3(f). Thus, H3(g) c H3(f).

On the other hand, for any g(t, x) e H3 (f), there exists a such that Ta3f (t, x) =

\f (3an(t),x) - g(t, x)| ^ 0, n ^ ro, V(t,x) e T* x S;
now making the change of variable 3an (t) = s, one has
\f (s, x) - g(3a-1 (s),x)| ^ 0, V(s,x) e T* x S,
that is, Ta3-1 g(t, x) = f (t, x). Thus, f e H3 (g) and so by what was shown above, 
H3(f) caH3(g).
Thus, it follows that H3(f) = H3(g). The proof is completed.

From Definition 4.7 and Theorem 4.7, the following theorem is immediate.
Theorem 4.8 If f(t, x) is 3-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D under the 
matched space (T, F, I n *, 3), then for any g e H3(f), g(t, x) is 3-almost periodic 
in t uniformly for x e D under the matched space (T, F, In*, 3).
Now, we will show the following theorems which guarantee four fundamental 
operations among 3-almost periodic functions.
Theorem 4.9 Assume that f(t, x) is 3-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D 
under the matched space (T, F, In*, 3). Then for any e > 0, there is a positive 
constant L = L(e, S); for any a e П, there exist a constant n > 0 and a e П such 
that [a, 3(a, n)]n* C [a, 3(a, L)]n* and [a, 3(a, n)]n* C E(e, f, S).
Proof From the uniform continuity of f(t, x) on T* x S, we have that for any given 
e>0, there exists 3*(e1, S) > 0; when |t1 - t2| < 3*(e1,S) we obtain

Now, let l(e 1, S) be the inclusion length of E(e 1, f, S). We choose n = 
8*^-, S^ = S*(e 1, S) and L = 8(l(e 1, S), n). For an arbitrary a e fl, considering 
an interval [a, S(a, L)|n* and selecting

where n* > en* satisfying 8(n*, n*) < 2 (in fact, we have n* - n-1 < n* <
In**, n*) < 2), thus we obtain
[S(r, n-1), S(t, n*У|п* C [a, S(a, L)]n*.
Hence, for all f e [s(t, n-1), s(t, n*У|л*, we obtain
If - T | < |8(т, n-1) - S(t, n*) I < 2S(n*, n*) < n.
Therefore, for any (t, x) e T* x S,
|f (8((t), x) - f (t, x)I < |f (8((t), x) - f (8Т(1), x)| + |f (8Т(1), x) - f (t, x)I < e.
We let a = 8(r, n-1), then [a, S(a, n)]n* c E(e, f, S). This completes the proof.

Theorem 4.10 Assume that f, g are --almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D

thus, we obtain A (8 (т 1, т2 1)) < L. Let m - n = s, then s can only be taken

According to Definition 4.4, one can easily prove the following theorem.
Theorem 4.11 Assume that f(t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D 
under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8), then for any a e R,b e fl, the functions 
af(t,x), f(8b(t),x) are 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D under the 
matched space (T, F, In*, 8).
Theorem 4.12 Assume that f is a 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D 
and g is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D under the matched space 
(T, F, I n *, 8), then fg is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D.
Proof According to Theorem 4.10, for any given s > 0, E(f, 2, S) n E(g, 2, S) is
nonempty relatively dense. Let sup 
|f(t,x)|=M1, 
sup 
|g(t,x)| = M2
(t,x) eT* x S 
(t,x) eT*x S
and choose т e E(f, 2, S) n E(g, 2, S), then for all (t, x) e T* x S we can obtain
|f (8r (t), x)g(8r(t), x) - f (t, x)g(t, x)| < |g(8r(t), x) I |f (8r (t), x) - f (t, x)|

Therefore, E(fg, s1, S) is a relatively dense set and т e E(fg, s1, S), i.e., fg is 
8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D. This completes the proof.

In what follows, we will establish a convergence theorem of 3-almost periodic

Theorem 4.14 If fn e C(T x D, En), n = 1, 2,...are 3-almost periodic in t for

f(t, x) is 3-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D.
Proof For any given e > 0, there is sufficiently large n0 such that
I f(t,x) - fn0 (t,x) | < 3, V(t,x) e T* x S.
Selecting т e E {fn0, 3, S}, then we have

set, i.e., f(t,x) is 3-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D. This completes the 
proof.

Because for any interval with length L, we have
F(s 1 ,x) - g > 0, 
G - F(s2,x) > 0,
thus there exist s1, s2 such that
F(s 1 ,x)<g + 2, 
F(s2,x)>G - 2.
Next, note that L = en*; we have inf 18L(t) -11 > q > 0 for all t e T*, where q

Theorem 4.16 Assume that f(t,x) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D, 
F(•) is uniformly continuous on the value field of f(t, x), then F ◦ f is 8-almost 
periodic in t uniformly for x e D under the matched space (T, F, I n *, 8).
Proof Note that F is uniformly continuous on the range of f (t, x); because f(t,x)

under the matched space (T, F, I n *, 8') if and only if for every pair of sequences 
a , в Q fl, there exist common subsequences a с a , в с в such that
T-S(a,e)f(t,x) = TafTpf(t,x). 
(4.9)
Proof If f (t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D, for any two 
sequences a , в Q fl, there exists subsequence вс в such that
T\ f(t,x) = g(t,x)
holds uniformly on T*x S and g(t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D. 
Taking a с a and a , в as the common subsequences of a , в , respectively, 
then there exists a с a such that
Tfg(t, x) = h(t, x)
holds uniformly on T* x S.
Similarly, taking в с в and в ,a as the common subsequences of в , a , 
respectively, then there exist common subsequences a с a , в с в such that
TLft’x) = k(t,X)
holds uniformly on T* x S. Thus, it follows that
Tpf(t,x) = g(t,x), T8g(t,x) = h(t,x)
hold uniformly on T* x S. Thus, for all e > 0, if n is sufficiently large, then for any 
(t, x) e T* x S, we have
If() - k(t,x)\ < 3,
g(t, x) - f (8pn(f)xx )| < e,
\h(t, x) - g(8a(tt'), x)| < 3.
Therefore,
|h(t,x) - k(t,x)| < \h(t, x) - g(aan(t),x)| + |g(8antf),x) - f (88(^n,^^^'), x)| 
+ lf(88(an,pn)('),x) - k(t,x)\ < e

holds for all (t, x) e T* x S. Since e > 0 is arbitrary, we have h(t, x) = k(t, x), 
that is, T3 p)f((’ x) = T3Tpf(t, x) holds uniformly on T* x S.
On the other hand, if (4.9) holds, then for any sequence y C fl, there exists 
subsequence y C y , such that T^, f(t, x) exists uniformly on T* x S.
In the following, we will show that f (t, x) is 3-almost periodic in t uniformly 
for x e D.
If this is not true, i.e., Tft x) does not converge uniformly on T* x S, then 
there exist e0 > 0 and 10 e T, subsequences a C y, в C y, s C fl and a = 
{a'n}, в' = {вп}, s = {s'„] such that
If (%'na)(t0),x) - f (33(s'n,вп)(t0),x)| ^ e0 > 0. 
(4Л0)
According to (4.9), there exist common subsequences a" C a', s" C s' such that 
for all (t, x) e T* x S, we have
T3(s "a" )f(t,x) = T3 T3 f(t,x). 
(4.11)
Take в" C в' and в'', a'', s" as common subsequences of в',a', s', respectively, 
such that for all (t, x) e T* x S, we have
Tfs,e)f(t,x') = TsSTpf(t,x). 
(4.12)
Similarly, taking a C a" satisfying а, в, s as common subsequences of 
a , в , s , respectively, according to (4.11), for all (t, x) e T* x S, we have
T3 f(t x^ — T3T3 f(t x) 
(4 13)
T<5(saf'tx) 
1s1af(t,x). 
(4.13)
Since Tf (t, x) = Tf(t, x) = T3f(t, x), from (4.12) and (4.13), for all (t, x) e 
T* x S, we have
Tfsef^x) = Tl^x),
that is, for all (t, x) e T* x S, we have
n ' i + +1 . f (S3(sn,Pn)(t), x) = n + f (%п,пп(^ x) .
Taking t = t0, this contradicts (4.10). Therefore, f(t, x) is 3-almost periodic in 
t uniformly for x e D under the matched space (T, F, In*, 3). The proof is 
completed.

3-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D.
In the following, we adopt the matrix norm |M(t, x)| = 
ki2 (t, x).

Definition 4.9 A matrix function M(t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for 
x e D if and only if for any e > 0, the shift set
E(M, e, S) = {т e П : |M(8T(t), x) - M(t, x)| < e, V(t, x) e T* x S}
is a relatively dense set in П.
Theorem 4.18 Definitions 4.8 and 4.9 are equivalent.
Proof First, assume that M (t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D ; 
it follows from Definition 4.8 that each element kij (t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t 
uniformly for x e D . Hence, for any given e>0, there is a nonempty relatively 
dense set A = Q E (kj (t, x),—=, S) such that т e A implies

Inversely, assume that for any given e>0, E(M, e, S) is a relatively dense set, 
then for any i = 1, 2,...,n; j = 1, 2,...,mand т e E(M,e,S), we obtain
\kiij (8T(t), x) — kij(t, x) | < |M (8T(t), x) — M (t, x)| < e, V (t, x) e T* x S,
which indicates that each element kij (t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for 
x e D, i.e., M(t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D. The proof is 
completed.

Definition 4.10 A continuous matrix function M(t, x) is said to be 8-normal if for

Theorem 4.19 A continuous matrix function M(t, x) is 8-normal if and only if 
M (t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D under the matched space 
(T, F, In* ,8).
Proof First, notice that ifM(t, x) is 8-normal, then each element kij(t, x) satisfies 
Definition 4.6, which implies that M(t, x) is 8-almost periodic.
Conversely, assume that M (t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D . 
According to Definition 4.8, for any sequence a c П, there is a subsequence 
a 1 c a such that T^jk 11 (t,x) exists uniformly on T* x S. Hence, there exists

4.3 Piecewise 3-Almost Periodic Stochastic Process in Shift 
Operators
The almost periodic stochastic process is a very important process in stochastic 
analysis (see [55]). In this section, we present some basic concepts and results which 
will be used later.
Let (Q, F, P) be a probability space and L2(Rn) stand for a space that consists 
of all Rn -valued random variables x with the norm
Ehx||2 = £ ||x||2dP.
Let ш be a standard Wiener process and suppose {rn(t + h) — rn(t) : h > 0} is 
independent of Ft := a{m(s) : 0 < s < t}, where FR := {Ft : t e R} is a 
filtration on R, and with a{•}, we mean the a-algebra generated by {•}. We denote 
A-stochastic integral on [0, 1]t, by /01 f(t)Arn(t).
Throughout this section, we assume that 3± are shift operators fulfilling Defini­
tion 3 from [33] and D± := {(s, t) e_T* x T* : 3±(s, t) e T*}, where T* is the 
largest subset of the time scale T, i.e., T* = T.
Based on Definition 1.22, we will introduce the following concept of relatively 
dense set under periodic time scales with shifts 3±.
Definition 4.11 Let T be a time scale with the shift operators 3± associated with 
the initial point t0 e T*. A subset S ofR is called relatively dense under the shift 3+ 
if there exists a positive number L e (t0, ж)T* such that [a, 3 + (L, a)]t* n S = 0 
for all a e T* . The number L is called the inclusion length with respect to the pair 
(T*,3+).
Remark 4.3 We address some classical definitions of relatively dense set from 
Definition 4.11.

(i) Let T = R, 8 + (L, a) = a + L. Definition 
becomes Definition 1.10 from 
[108].
4.11 
Definition 4.12 A subset S of R is called relatively dense if there exists a positive 
number L such that [a, a + L] A S = 0 for all a e R.
(ii) Let T = qZ,q> 1, 8+(L, a) = aL. Definition 
becomes the concept of 
relatively dense set on quantum time scale.
4.11 
Definition 4.13 A subset S of R is called relatively dense if there exists a positive 
number L e (1, rc>) A qZ such that [a, aL]qZ A S = 0 for all a e qZ.
(iii) Let T = N2, 8 + (L, a) = JL2 + a2. We will obtain the following concept of 
relatively dense set on this irregular time scale.
Definition 4.14 A subset S of R is called relatively dense if there exists a positive 
number L e (0, те) A N1 such that [a, ^L2 + a21 A S = 0 for all a e N2.
(iv) Let T = Z,8+ (L, a) = a + L. The following concept of relatively dense set 
in discrete situation follows.
Definition 4.15 A subset S of R is called relatively dense if there exists a positive 
number L e (0, те) A Z such that [a, a + L]Z A S = 0 for all a e Z.
From (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), we obtain that Definition 4.11 is efficient and feasible to 
include some important irregular time scales and it will contribute to introducing 
almost periodic functions on irregular time scales.
For convenience, PCrd T,L2 (Rn) denotes the set of all piecewise continuous 
stochastic process with respect to a sequence {tk}, k e Z.
By Lemma 3.1, the following lemma follows.
Lemma 4.1 If tkj = 8-(tk, tk+j) and k, j e Z, then
8 (tj tj \ = 8 (tk 1 tk 1 \ 8 (tk 1 tj\ = tj-ki
8- tk , tk+k1 = 8- tk , tk+j ,8- tk ,tk = tk+k1 .
Proof From the condition and properties of 8±, we obtain 8+(tk, tkj) = tk+j .By 
Lemma 3.1, we calculate that

Furthermore, we have
3-(tk1 ,tjj) = 3-(3-(tk, tk+k 1), 3-(tk, tk+j))
= 3- (tk+k1 , tk+j ) = 3- tk+k1 , t(k+k1 )-(k1 -j)
k1 -j
= tk+k1 .
This completes the proof. 
□
According to Lemma 4.1, we adopt the notion tkj := 3-(tk, tk+j) and introduce 
the concept of equipotentially almost periodic sequence under the shift operators 
3±.
Definition 4.16 For any e > 0, let Ге c T* be a set of real numbers and {tk} c T*. 
We say {tjj}, k, j e Z is equipotentially almost periodic under the shift operators 3± 
if for r e Ге, there exists at least one integer q such that |tq — r | < e, for all k e Z.
Based on Definition 4.11, we introduce the following new concepts of almost 
periodic stochastic process. Let Q c L2(Rn) or Q = L2(Rn); we will introduce 
the following definitions.
Let 10 be the initial point and П := {p e T* : (p, t) e D± for all t e T*} e 
{{10}, 0}, then for any s e П, we define a function A : П ^ П,
A(s) =
3+ (s, t0), 
s > t0,
3- (s, t0), 
s < t0,
which will be used later. Note that A(s) > 10 and A(s) > s.
Definition 4.17 Let T be periodic in shifts 3± and t0 e T* be an initial point. 
{tk} c T* satisfies that the derived sequence {tkj}, k,j e Z, is equipotentially 
almost periodic under the shift operators 3±. We call a stochastic process p e 
PCrd (T x Q, L2(Rn)} mean-square almost periodic in t uniformly for x e Q 
if for any e>0 and for each compact subset S of Q :
(i) There is a positive number 3 * = 3* (e, S) such that if the points t' and t" belong 
to the same continuous interval and 11 — t | < 3*, then
E||p(t , x) — p(t , x)||2 < e for all t , t e T*.

252
4 Almost Periodic Functions Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
(ii) There is a relative dense set Г0 c (tо, ж)T* of mean-square e-almost periods 
with respect to the pair (T*, S+) such that if т e Г0, then
E|| V(S±(т, t), x) — v(t, x) ||2 < e for all (t, x) e T* x S
satisfying the condition A S- (t, tk) >e,ke Z.
Example 4.3.1 The time scale qZ = [nn, n e Z andq = 34] U{0} is periodic with 
period т under the shift operator S±. The piecewise stochastic process is defined by
lnt 
Inqt
f1 (t) = H)]lnq, f2(t) = [m]lnq, G(t) =
1,t>1,
—1, 0 <t< 1.
Let т = q2 and S±(т, t) = q±2t e qZ\{0} = qZ; we have f1(S±(т, t)) = 
ln t 
ln t
[0(t)]lnq = [0(t)]lnq = f1 (t) for all t e qZ. Similarly, let т = q7; it follows 
that f 2(S±(т, t)) = f 2(t). Hence, we obtain an almost periodic piecewise stochastic 
process F(t) = f1(t) + f2(t) on qZ, where f1, f2 are periodic piecewise stochastic 
processes on qZ, respectively. Note that the periods of f1 and f2 are completely 
different. 
□
Remark 4.4 According to Definition 4.17, we obtain the classical concept of almost 
periodic stochastic process on R and Z. Now, we will demonstrate two concepts of 
almost periodic stochastic process on irregular time scales.
(a) Let T = qZ and S + (т, t) = rt; under Definition 
, Definition 
becomes:
4.13
4.17 
Definition 4.18 We call a stochastic process v e PCr^qZ x Q, L2 (Rn)} mean­
square almost periodic in t uniformly for x e Q if for any e > 0 and for each 
compact subset S of Q :
(i) There is a positive number S * = S* (e, S) such that if the points t' and t" belong 
to the same continuous interval and 11 — t | < S*, then
E||v(t , x) — v(t ,x) 112 < e for t , t e qZ.
(ii) There is a relative dense set Г0 c (1, ж)qZ of mean-square e-almost periods 
such that if т e Г0, then
E||v(тt, x) — v(t, x) ||2 < e for all (t, x) e qZ x S
or
E||^(t/т, x) — v(t, x) ||2 < e for all (t, x) e qZ x S
which satisfies the condition A(t/tk) > e, ke Z.

4.3 Piecewise 3-Almost Periodic Stochastic Process in Shift Operators
253
(b) Let T = N2 and 3 + (т, t) = ^t2 ± т2; under Definitions 
, and 
 
becomes:
4.14
4.17
Definition 4.19 We call a stochastic process <p e PCrd (N2 x Q, L2(Rn)) mean­
square almost periodic in t uniformly for x e Q if for any e > 0 and for each 
compact subset S of Q :
(i) There is a positive number 3 * = S* (e, S') such that if the points t' and t" belong 
to the same continuous interval and 11 — t | < S*, then
E||p(t , x) — v(t ,x)||2 < e for t , t e N2.
(ii) There is a relative dense set Г0 c (0, rc>)N1 of mean-square e-almost periods 
such that if т e Г0, then
E||v(Vt2 ± т2, x) — v(t, x) ||2 < e for all (t, x) e N2 x S
which satisfies the condition |t2 — tk2 | >e, k e Z.
Next, we will introduce the concept of piecewise A-almost periodic stochastic 
process under the periodic time scales in shifts 3± .
Definition 4.20 Let T be periodic in shifts 3± and t0 e T* be an initial point; 
the shift S± (т, t) is A -differentiable with rd-continuous derivatives for all t e 
(tk, tk+1)T* ,k e Z. {tk} c T* satisfies that the derived sequence {tkj }, k,j e Z, 
is equipotentially almost periodic under the shift operators S± . We call a stochastic 
process v e PCrd (T x Q, L2(R”^ mean-square A-almost periodic in t uniformly 
for x e Q if for any e>0 and for each compact subset S of Q :
(i) There is a positive number S * = S* (e, S) such that if the points t' and t" belong 
to the same interval of continuity and 11 — t | < S*, then
E||v(t , x) — <p(t , x)||2 < e for t , t e T*.
(ii) There is a relative dense set Г0 c (tо, те)T* of mean-square e-almost periods 
with respect to the pair (T*, S+) such that if т e Г0, then
E||V(S±(т, t), x)S±(т, t) — <p(t, x) ||2 < e for all (t, x) e T* x S
which satisfies the condition A S— (t, tk) >e,ke Z.
Remark 4.5 Similar to Remark 4.4, we can also obtain some new concepts of A- 
almost periodic stochastic process on irregular time scales; the results are obvious 
according to Definition 4.20, so we will not repeat them here.

254
4 Almost Periodic Functions Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
Example 4.3.2 On the time scale (V5)Z = {(V5)n. n e Z}, let a, b e R\{0}. a =
b, and define the following stochastic processes g 1 (t) = a, g2(t) =------——.

Hence, G(t) is a A-almost periodic stochastic process under the shift operators 
S ±, where g 1 (t). g 2 (t) are A -periodic stochastic process on (V5) Z. Note that the 
periods of g 1 and g2 are completely different. 
□
4.4 n0-Order A-Almost Periodic Functions
In this section, we introduce some new concepts of almost periodic functions under 
the matched space (T. In*. F. 8) and some basic results will be established.
Definition 4.21 Let T be a periodic time scale under the matched space 
(T. I n *. F. 8) and n о e N; the shift ST(t) is A -differentiable with rd-continuous 
derivatives 8A(t) := SA(r.t) for all t e T*. A function f e C(T x D. X) is 
called an n0-order A-almost periodic function (An0-almost periodic function) 
in t e T uniformly for x e D under the matched space if there exists some 
i0 > 1. ni e Z. i = 1. 2..... iо such that the e-shift set of sf1 n0
E {e.sf1 .ni0. S } = {т e fl: || f ( St ± (t).x )(SA± (t)) n0 - sf1 .ni0 (t.x)\\ < e.
for all t e T* and x e S}
is a relatively dense set with respect to the pair (П*. S) for all e > 0 and for each 
compact subset S of D; that is, there exists some i0 > 1. n e Z. i = 1. 2..... i0 
such that for any given e>0 and each compact subset S of D, there exists a 
constant l(e. S') > 0 such that each interval of length l(e. S') contains a т(е. S) e

n 1 ,ni 
n 1 ,ni
of E{e, Sf 0, S}, and Sf 0 is called the approximation shift selection-function 
(ASS-function) of f.
Remark 4.6 For simplicity, throughout the section, for any т e П*, the notation 
&A(t) means8A (t) := (8r(t))A, which indicates that&A1 (8т2 (t)) = (8т 1 (8т2 (t)))A = 
8A((t-) = 8A(8т2(t))8A2(t) from Theorem 1.93 in [61].
Remark 4.7 Note that with i0 = 1, n 1 = n0, we obtain Sf0 = f (t, x)(8^* (t))n0 
and (4.14) is equivalent to the following inequality:
|| f (8r(t),x)(8A(t))n0 — f(t,x)(8An* (t))n0|| < e. 
(4.15)
From (4.15), for any т 1, т2 e E {e, Sf, S}, we obtain
I f (' (т1 ,т2 )(t),x )(8Aт 1 ,т2 }(t) ) n 0 — f (8т 1 (t),x )(8A (t) ) n 0||
= || f (8т2 (8т 1 (t)),x)(8A2 (8т 1 (t)))n0 — f (8т 1 (t),x)(8A1 (t))n01| < e.
Furthermore, replace t with 8т—1 (t) in (4.15), and we get т— 1 e E{e, Sf, S}. If 
8(т 1, т—1) e E{e, Sf, S}, then
|| f (8т 1 (t), x)(8A (t))n0 — f (8т2 (t))(8A2 (t))n01|
= IIf (88(т 1 ,т—1 )(t),x)(8A(r 1 ,т—1 )(е>)n0 — f(t,x)(8An*(t))n0H <e.
In the following, we will provide an example of a A 8-almost periodic function.
Example 4.4.1 For any a e R\{0}, the real-valued function f1 (t) = a/t defined on 
(V3)Z = {(V3)n, n e Z} is A ^-periodic under the matched space (T, IП*, F, 8') 
with the period т = V3 since
f1( 8( V3) ±1(t))8 Av3) ±1(t) = (73a±7(73) ±1 = a = f1 (t).

4 Almost Periodic Functions Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
Now, let f 2 (t) = 
log . Similarly, taking т = (V3)2, we obtain
f2(b(Л)±2(t))(b(Л)±2g = (-1 
(лb±21 • ()±21 •(V3)±2
b
= (— 1)±2+logV3 t • t 
b
= (-1) logV3 tt = f2(t).
Hence, we obtain F(t) = f1 (t)+f2(t) which is a ^-almost periodic function under 
the matched space (T, In*, F, b'). Note that the periods of f1 and f 2 are completely 
different.

Remark 4.8 Note that Example 4.4.1 is a ^-almost periodic function under the 
matched space (T, In*, F, b') which can be used to study almost periodic problems 
of q -difference dynamic equations and this type of function for q-difference 
dynamic equations is new.
For convenience, we denote АРП0 (T) the set of all Asn0-almost periodic functions 
in shifts on T and introduce some notations: Let a = {an} с П and в = 
{вп} с fl be two sequences. Then в с a means that в is a subsequence of 
a; S (a, в) = {3 (an, вп)}; a-1 = {a—1}, where S (a, a-1) = en *; a and в are 
common subsequences of a and в , respectively, which means that an = an(k) and 
вп = вп (к) for some given function n(k).

Theorem 4.20 Let f e C(T x D, En) be АП -almost periodic in t uniformly for 
x e D with the ASS-function Sf0 = f (t, x)(8fn* (t)n0 under the matched space 
(T, F, In*, 8), and 8T(t) be continuous in t. Then Sf0 is uniformly continuous and 
bounded on T* x S.
Proof For a given e < 1 and some compact set S c D, there exists a constant 
l(e, S) such that in any interval of length l(e, S), there exists т e E{e, Sf0, S} such 
that
| f(8r(t),x)(8A(t))n0 - f(t,x)(8fn* (t))n01 <e < 1, for all (t,x) e T* x S.
Since f e C(T x D, En), for any (t, x) e ([10, 8(l, 10)]T) x S, 10 e T*, there exists 
an M > 0 such that | f (t, x)| < M. For any given t e T*, take т e E(e, Sf0, S) n 
[F(Ait),8(l,F(Ait))]n, then 8r(t) e [3(F(Ait),t),8(8(l,F(Ait)),t)]T, i.e., 
8T(t) e [8(F(Ait),t),8(l, 8(F(Ait), t)]T. Hence, for x e S, we have 
| f(8t(t),x)(8A(t))n0| <M and |f (8r(t), x}(8A(t))n0—f(t,x)(8An* (t))n0| < 1.
Thus for all (t, x) e T* x S, we have |f (t, x) (8An* (t))n0| < M + 1.

Sf0 = f (t, x)8An* (t) is uniformly continuous on ([t0, 8(l 1, 10)]T) x S. Hence, there 
exists a positive constant 8* = 8*^^, , and for any 11, 12 e [10, 8(l 1, 10)]T and 
|t 1 — t2| < 8*,
|f(t 1, x)(8An* (t 1))n0 - f(t2, x)(8An* (t2))n0| < e for all x e S.
Now, we choose an arbitrary u, t e T*, satisfying 11 — и| <8*, and we take

then 8T(t), 8т(и) e [8(F(Ait, t), 8(11, 8(F(Ait), t))]T. Since 8T(t) is continuous in 
t, then there exists 8 ** > 0 such that 11 — v | <8 ** implies
18T(t) — 8r(u)| <8*.
Now, we take 8** = min {8*, 8**}, when 11
v | < 8** implies

In the following, we will establish a shift-convergence theorem of Asn0-almost 
periodic functions.
Theorem 4.21 Let f e C(T x D, En) be Asn0 -almost periodic in t uniformly for 
x e D with the ASS-function Sf0 = f (t, x')(8?n* (t)n0 under the matched space 
(T, F, I П *, 8). Then for any given sequence аг П, there exists a subsequence 
в г а' and g e C(T x D, En) such that Tffn0(Sf0) = Sf,0 holds uniformly on 
T* x S and g(t,x) is Asn 0 -almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with the ASS­
function Sg0 = g(t, x)(8? * (t))"0 under the matched space (T, F, IП*, 8).
Proof For any e > 0 and S г D let l = ly^, SJ be an inclusion length of
E -, Sf0, S . For any given subsequence а' = {an} г П, we denote an = 
4
8(тп, y"), where Tn e E e, Sf0, S , yn e П and en* < y" < l,n = 1, 2,....(In 
4
fact, for any interval with length l, there exists Tn e E 4, sf0, s ; thus, we choose 
a proper interval with length of l such that еП* < 8 {an, (тп)-1) < l; from the 
definition of fl, it follows that yn = 8 {an, (тп )-1) e П). Therefore, there exists a 
subsequence у = {yn} г у = {yn} such that yn ^ s as n ^ те, еП* < s < l.
Also, it follows from Theorem 4.20 that Sf 0 is uniformly continuous on T* x S. 
Hence, there exists 8* (e, S) > 0 so that 111 - 12| < 8*, for x e S, implies
|f(8r(t 1 ),x)(8?(t 1))"0 - f (8r(t2),x)(8?(t2))"0| < 2.
Since у is a convergent sequence, there exists N = N(8) so that p, m > N 
implies |yp - ym| < 8*. Now, we take а г a , т г т = {ти) such that а, т are 
common with y, then for any integers p, m > N, by Remark 4.7, we have

4 Almost Periodic Functions Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
Therefore, {f(8pn(t),x)(8pn(t))n0} converges uniformly on T* x S, i.e., 
Tp’n0(Sf0) = Sg0 holds uniformly on T* x S, where в = {вп} С a.
Next, we will prove that g(t, x) (8^n* (t))n0 is continuous on T* x D. If this is 
not true, there must exist (t0,x0) e T* x D such that g(t, x)^* (t)n0 is not 
continuous at this point. Then there exist e0 > 0 and sequences {8^}, {tm}, {xm}, 
where 8m > 0, 8m —— 0 as m —— +^o, 110 — tm | + |x0 — xm | < 8m and
|g(t0,x0)(8^n* (t0))n0 — g(tm,xm)(8^n* (tm))n0| > e0. 
(4.16)
Let X = {xm} U{x0}, and obviously, X is a compact subset of D. Hence, there 
exists positive integer N = N(e0, X) so that n > N implies
|f (8Pn(tm), xm )(8^(tm) )n 0 — g(tm, xm) (8^ * (tm) )n 0| < e^ for all m e Z+ 
(4.17) 
and
|f (8pn(t0),xo)(8*(t0))n0 — g(t0, x0)(8^* (t0))n0| < e0. 
(4.18)
According to the uniform continuity of f (t, x) on T* x D, for sufficiently large m, 
we have
|f (8pn(t0),xo)(8^(t0))n0 — f (8pn(tm),xm)(8^(tm))n°| < e^. 
(4.19)
From (4.17)-(4.19), we get
|g(t 0, x 0 ) (8fn * (t 0 ) ) n 0 — g(tm,xm) (8fn * (tm) ) n 0 | < e 0,
and this contradicts (4.16). Therefore, Sg0 is continuous on T* x D.
Finally, for any compact set S c D and given e > 0, one can take т e 
E{e, Sf0, S}, and then for all (t, x) e T* x S, the following holds:
|f (8pn(8r(t)),x)(8l(8r(t))(8)f(t))n0 — f (8pn(t),x)(8^(t))n0| < e.
Let n — +^, for all (t, x) e T* x S, and we have
|g(8r(t),x)(8^(t))n0 — g(t,x)(8ffn* (t))n0| < e,
which implies that E{e, Sg0, S} is relatively dense. Therefore, g(t, x) is ^n0-almost 
periodic in t uniformly for x e D with the ASS-function Sg0 = g(t, x) (8^n* (t))n0 
under the matched space (T, F, In* ,8). This completes the proof. 
□

4.4 no-Order A-Almost Periodic Functions

Next, we will give a sequentially compact criterion of An0-almost periodic 
functions through the shift operator T8,10.
Theorem 4.22 Let f e C( T x D, En). If for any sequence а с П, there exists 
а с а' such that Tan0 (Sf0) exists uniformly on T* x S, then f(t, x) is An 0 -almost 
periodic in t uniformly for x e D with the ASS-function Sfn0 under the matched 
space (T, F, In*, 8), where Sf0 = f (t, x) (3^* (t))n0.
Proof For contradiction, if this is not true, then there exist e0 > 0 and S с D such 
that for any sufficiently large l>0, we can find an interval with length of l and 
there are no e0-shift numbers of Sfn0 (t, x) in this interval, that is, every point in this 
interval is not in E{e0, Sfn0 ,S}.
We take a number a1 e fl and find an interval (a 1, b 1) with b 1 - a 1 > 2|a1|, 
where a 1, b 1 e fl such that there are no e0-shift numbers of Sf0 (t,x) in this interval. 
Next, taking a2 e (3(a1 ,a 1), 8(a1 ,b 1 ^, obviously, 8(a2, (a1)—1) e (a 1 ,b 1), 
so 8(a2,(a1)—1) e E{e0, Sf0,S}; then one can find an interval (a2,b2) with 
b2 - a2 > 2(|a11 + |a2|), where a2,b2 e fl such that there are no e0-shift 
numbers of Sf0 (t, x) in this interval. Next, taking a3 e (3(a2, a2), 3(a2, b2)), a3 e 
n 
8(a1, a2), 8(a1, b2) , obviously, 8 a3 , (a2)-1 , 8 a3 , (a1)-1 
e E{e0, Sf0 ,S}.
We may repeat this process again and again, and find a4, a5, ..., such that 
8( ai, (aj)—1) e E {e 0, Sf0 ,S}, i > j. Hence, for any i = j, i, j = 1, 2,..., 
without loss of generality, let i>j; for x e S we have
sup

Therefore, there is no uniformly convergent subsequence of {f (8a'(t), x) (A (t))"0} 
for (t, x) e T* x S, and this is a contradiction. Thus, f(t, x) is A8n0 -almost periodic 
in t uniformly for x e D with the ASS-function Sf0 = f (t, x) (8^* (t))n0 under the 
matched space (T, F, In* ,8). This completes the proof. 
□
From Theorems 4.21 and 4.22, we obtain the following equivalent definition of 
the uniformly A8n0 -almost periodic functions.
Definition 4.22 Let f e C(T x D, En). If for any given sequence a' с fl, there 
exists a subsequence a с a' such that Tff'n0 (Sf0) exists uniformly on T* x S, where 
Sf0 = f(t,x)(8^n* (t))n0, then f(t,x) is called a An0-almost periodic function 
in t uniformly for x e D with the ASS-function Sfn0 under the matched space 
(T, F, In*, )..

4 Almost Periodic Functions Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
Theorem 4.23 If f e C( T x D, En) is Asn 0 -almost periodic in t uniformly for x e 
D with the ASS-function Sf0 = f (t, x)(&An* (t))n0, f(t) is A&
n0-almostperiodic with 
the ASS-function Sf0 = f(t) (8An* (t))n0 and {Sf0 : t e T} c S, then f (t, Sf0 (t)) is 
Asn0-almost periodic with the ASS-function Sf0 = f (t, Sf 0 (t)) (§An* (t))n0.
Proof For any given sequence a c fl, there exist a c a , f(t), g(t, x) such that 
Ta8,n0 (Sf0) = f(t)(8ffn* (t))n0 exists uniformly on T* and
Tf8’n0(Sf0) = g(t,x)(8?n* (t)n0
exists uniformly on T* x S, where f(t) is Asn0-almost periodic with
Sf0 = ((^Ап* (t)n0
and g(t, x) is A"0-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with Sg0 = 
g(t,x)(8^* (t))n0. Therefore, Sg0 is uniformly continuous on T* x S, and then
for any given s > 0, there exists 8 *( О > 0 such that for any x 1, x2 e S and all 
t e T*, when |x 1 - x2| < 8*f s\, we have
|g(t,x 1)(8An* (t))"0 - g(t,x2)(8An* (t))"01 < 2.
For a sufficiently large N0(s) > 0 so that n > Nо(s) we have

where ^{8an{^){8^n{^}'00 : t e T} c fp){A?n*(t)]n0 : t e T} = {Sf0 : t e

thus, T8"0 (sf0 (t, Sf0 (t))) = g(t, A(t))(&An* (t))"0 = Sfn0 exists uniformly on T*. 
Therefore, f (t, Sf0(t)) is A f0-almost periodic with the ASS-function
sf0 = f (t,Sf0 (t))(sAn * (t))" 0
under the matched space (T, F, In* ,8). The proof is completed.

Definition 4.23 Let f e C(T x D, E"). Then Hn0(Sf0) = {Sg0(t, x) : T ^ E"|

Theorem 4.24 Hn0 (Sf0) is compact if and only if f(t, x) is A f0-almost periodic 
in t uniformly for x e D with the ASS-function f(t, x)(sAn * (t))"0.
Proof If Hn0(Sf0) is compact, for any given a = {an} c ft, there exists a subse­
quence { f (Sank (t), x )(k (t) ) "0 } k eN of the sequence { f (8a" (t), x )(8An (t) ) "0 } n e

Noting that a = {ank}, obviously, a с a', so TaA"0Sf0 (t, x) exists uniformly on

Conversely, if f (t, x) is A f0-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with the

so that
nlim^g^(t,x)(8n* (t))n0 = T^n0Sf0(t,x) e Hn0(Sf0), V(t,x) e T*x S,

Theorem 4.25 If f(t,x) is An0-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with 
the ASS-function Sf0 = f (t, x) (8-'f* (t))n0 under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8), 
then for any Sgn0(t, x) e Hn0(Sfn0), Hn0(Sfn0) = Hn0(Sgn0) holds.
Proof For any h(t, x)(8An* (t))n0 e Hn0 (Sf0), there exists a' c fl such that
Tfn0Sf0(t,x) = h(t,x)(&An* (t))n0•
Since f(t,x) is An0-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with the ASS­
function Sf0, from the sequence {an} c fl one can extract a sequence {an} such 
that T8n0Sf0(t, x) = lim f (8an(t), x)(8£n(t))n0 exists uniformly on T* x S.
For Sf0 = g(t, x)(8An* (t))n0 e Hn0(Sf0), there exists a(1) c fl such that
lim f (^( 1 )(t),x )(8A( 1 )(t)) n 0 = g(t,x) (8An * (t)) n 0, V (t,x) e T*x S;

then we take в = {fin} = {8(an , an)} such that
\f (8pn(t),x)(8pn(t))n0 - g(8an(t),x)(8An(t))n0| < 1, V(t,x) e T* x S^
It follows that Tff’n0Sf0(t,x) 
= 
T8n0Sf0(t,x) 
= 
T^n0Sf0 (t, x) =
h(t, x)(8An* (t))n0. Hence Sh(t, x) e Hn0(Sf0). Thus, Hn0(Sf0) c Hn0(Sf0).
On the other hand, for any Sg (t, x) e Hn0 (Sfn0 ), there exists a such that
Ta8,n0Sfn0 (t, x) = Sgn0(t, x),
then
\f (8an(t),x)(8An(t)) n 0 - g(t,x) (8An * (t)) n 0| ^ 0,

thus making the change of variable t = 8--1 (s), we obtain

that is, T'A'ASg0 (t,x) = Sf0 (t, x). Therefore, Sf(t,x) e Hn0 (Snn0) and by what 
was shown above, it follows that Hn0 (S'”0) c Hn0 (Sg0).
According to the above proof, we have H”0 (Sf”0 ) = H”0 (Sg”0). The proof is

From Definition 4.23 and Theorem 4.25, the following theorem is immediate.
Theorem 4.26 If f(t,x) is A”0-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with 
the ASS-function Sf0 = f (t, x) (8An* (t))”0 under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8), 
then for any Sg0 e Hn0 (Sf0), g(t, x) is An0-almost periodic in t uniformly for 
x e D with the ASS-function Sg0 = g(t, x)(8An* (t))”0.
Now, we will show the following theorems to guarantee four fundamental 
operations among the A8n0 -almost periodic functions.
Theorem 4.27 Let f(t, x) be A8n0 -almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with 
the ASS-function Sf0 = f (t, x) (8^* (t))”0 under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8). 
Then for any e > 0, there exists a positive constant L = L(e, S); for any a e fl, 
there exist a constant n > 0 and a e fl such that [a, 8(a, n)]П* C [a, 8(a, L)]n* 
and [ a, 8 (a, n) ] n * C E(e,Sf,S).
Proof Since Sfn0 (t, x) is uniformly continuous on T* x S, for any e>0, there exists 
8*(e1, S) > 0 so that |t1 - t2| < 8*(e1,S) implies
\f(t 1 ,x) (8An* (t 1))”0 - f(t2,x) (8An* (t2))”0| <e 1, 
Vx e S,
e
where e 1 = -
We take n = 8*(2, SJ = 8*(e 1, S), and L = 3(l(e 1, S), n), where l(e 1, S) is 
the inclusion length of E(e1, Sfn0, S).
For any a e fl, consider an interval [a, 8(a, L)]n*, and take
т e E(e 1, Sf, S) П [8 (a, n * 1), 8 (n *, 8 {a, l(e 1, S)))]n *,
where n* > еП* satisfying 3(n*, n*) < n (in fact, we have n* - n*1 < n* < 
8(n*, n*) < 2); thus we obtain
[3(т, n* 1), 8(т, n*)|n* C [a, 8(a, L)]n*.

Hence, for all f e [3(t, n*1), 8(т, n*)|П*, we obtain
|f - т | < 18(t, n* 1) - 3(t, n*) | < 23(n*, П*) < П-
Therefore, for any (t, x) e T* x S,
\f (8f(t),x)(8f(t))n0 - f(t,x)(8?** (t))n0|
< | f (8f(t),x)(8f (t))n0 - f (8r(t), x)(8? (t))n0|
+ \f (8r(t),x)(8?(t))n0 - f(t,x) (8?** (t))n0| < e.
Thus we let a = 8(t, n-1), then [a, 8(a, n)]П* C E(e, Sf0, S). This completes 
the proof. 
□
In the following theorem, for n e П*, we will use notation 8n = 8(n, еП*) = n, 
82 n = 8 (n, 8 n), 83 n = fa, 82 n), ...,8mn := fa, fa-1 )n) for simplicity.
Theorem 4.28 Let f, g be Л-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with orders 
n 1, n2 andASS-functions Sf1 = f (t, x)(8^** (t))n 1, Sng2 = g(t, x)(8^** (t))n2 under 
the matched space (T, F, IП *, 8), respectively. Then for any e > 0, E(Sf1, e, S') П 
E(Sg2, e, S) is a nonempty relatively dense set in П*.
Proof Since f, g are Л-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D under the matched 
space (T, F, IП*, 8') with orders n 1, n2, respectively, they are uniformly continuous 
on T* x S. For any given e > 0, one can take 8* = 8* -, S (i = 1, 2); and 11 =

respectively.
According to Theorem 4.24, we take
n = n(e, S) = min(8*, 8*) e П, Li = 8(li, n) (i = 1, 2), L = max(L1, L2).
Hence, we can find --shift numbers of Sf1 (t, x) and Sf2 (t, x): т 1 = 8mn and т2 = 
nn,, respectively, where т 1, т2 e [a, 8(a, L)]П*, m, n are integers. Since т2-1 e 
[8(a.-1, L-1), a-1], then we obtain

thus, A(5(t 1, т2 1)) < L. Let m — n = s, then s can only be taken from a finite

For any a e П*, on the interval [8(a, T), 8(8(a, T),L)]п*, we can take --shift 
numbers of Sf1 (t, x) and Sgn2 (t, x): т 1 and т2, respectively; there must exist some

According to Definition 4.5, the following theorem is immediate.
Theorem 4.29 If f(t,x) is A10-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with 
the ASS-function Sf0 = f (t, x) (8^* (t))n0 under the matched space (T, F, Iп*, 8), 

268
4 Almost Periodic Functions Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
then for any a e R ,b e П, functions af(t, x), f(8b(t), x) are An 0-almost periodic 
in t uniformly for x e D under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8') with the same 
ASS-function Sfn0.
Theorem 4.30 If f is a An 1 -almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with the 
ASS-function Sf 1 = f (t, x){fAn* (t))" 1 and g is An2-almostperiodic in t uniformly 
for x e D with the ASS-function Snn2 = g(t,x)(8f* (t)n2 under the matched space 
(T, F, I n *, S'), then fg is An 1+ n 2 -almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with the 
ASS-function Sfg+ n2 = f(t, x)g(t, x) (8^n* (t))n 1+ n2.
Proof From Theorem 4.28, for any e > 0, E(Sf 1, -, S') П E(Sf2,-,S) 
is a nonempty relatively dense set. Denote sup |Sfn1 (t, x)| = M1, 
(t,x) eT* x S
sup 
|Sng2(t,x)| = M2, take т e E(Sf 1, -, S) П E(Sf2, -, S), then for all
(t,x)eT*xS 
2 
2
(t, x) e T* x S we have
|f (8T(t), x)g(8T(t), x)(8?(t))n 1+ n2 - f(t, x)g(t, x) (8^n* (t))n 1+ n21
< |g(8T(t), x)(8?(t))n2 ||f (8T(t), x)(8Tf(t))n 1 - f(t, x)(8^n* (t))n 11
+ \f(t, x) (8en* (t))n 11 |g(8r(t), x) (8^(t))n2 - g(t, x) (8^n* (t))n21
< (M 1 + M2)e = e 1.
Therefore, т e E(Sfn1g+n2, -1, S), E(Sfn1g+n2, -1, S) is a relatively dense set; thus fg 
is A8n1 +n2 -almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with the ASS-function Sfn1g+n2 . 
This completes the proof. 
□
Next, we provide an example of a A82-almost periodic function.
Example 4.4.2 From Example 4.4.1, on the time scale 5Z ={5n,n e Z} we 
consider the following function:
ь 2
G(t) = F (t) • F (t) = (f1 (t) + f2 (t) 2 = -t + (-1 ) log5 tj ,
which is A2-almost periodic according to Theorem 4.30. 
□
Theorem 4.31 If f, g are A8n0 -almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with the 
ASS-functions Sf0 = f(t,x) (8^n* (t))n0 and Snn0 = g(t,x)(8^n* (t))n0 under the 
matched space (T, F, In*, 8), then f + g are An0-almost periodic in t uniformly 
for x e D with the ASS-function Sf+ g = (f(t,x) + g(t,x))(8^* (t))n0. If

Proof From Theorem 4.28, for any e > 0, E(Sfn, ^, S) П E(Sg0, e, S) is a 
nonempty relatively dense set. Notice that if т e E(Sf0, 2, S) П E(Sg0, 2, S), then 
т e E(Sf+g, e, S). Hence
(E(Sf0, 2, S) П E(Sg0, e, S)) C E(Sf+ g, e, S).
Therefore, E(Sf+g, e, S') is a relatively dense set, so f + g is An0-almost periodic 
in t uniformly for x e D with the ASS-function Sf+g = f (t, x)g(t, x) (&An* (t))n0■
Finally, denote inf 
|Sgf0 (t, x)|=N and take т e E(Sgf0, e, S), then for all
(t,x) eT*x S g

(t, x) e T* x S, we have

that is, т e E(S01 ,e2, S). Hence, -^0 is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for

The proof is completed.
In what follows, we will establish a convergence theorem of A8n0-almost periodic 
function sequences.
Theorem 4.32 If fn e C(T x D, En), n = 1, 2,... are A8n0-almost periodic in t 
forx e D, and the sequence {Sfn0 (t, x)} uniformly converges to Sfn0 (t, x) on T* x S, 
where Sfn0 = fn(t, x)(8An* (t))n00and Sf = f(t, x)(8An* (t))n0, then f(t, x) is An0- 
almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D.

The following theorem is related to the compound function of a ASn0 -almost

Theorem 4.34 If f(t,x)is ASn0 -almost periodic in t uniformly forx e D with the 
ASS-function Sf0 — f (t, x')(SAn* (t)n0, F(•) is uniformly continuous on the value

Proof In fact, since F is uniformly continuous on the value field of Sfn0 (t, x), and

Proof If f (t, x) is A„0-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D with the ASS­
function Sf0 = f (t, x)(&An* (t)n0, for any two sequences a , f c fl, there exists 
a subsequence в" с в' such that

Taking a с a and a , f as the common subsequences of a , f , respectively, 
then there exists a с a such that
TSaf0 Sg 0 (t,x) = Sg0 (t,x)
holds uniformly on T* x S.
Similarly, taking f с в , and в , a as the common subsequences of f , a , 
respectively, then there exist common subsequences a с a , в с в such that
T£ S'0 (t,x) = Sn 0 (t,x)

T&fn 0 Sf0 (t, x) = Sg0 (t, x), T^n0 Sg0 (t, x) = Sg0 (t, x)
hold uniformly on T* x S. Thus, for all e > 0, if n is sufficiently large, then for any 
(t, x) e T* x S, we have
If (8'S (an,Pn^x )(8A

\h(t,x) (SA * (t)) n0 — g (8an(t),x )(8An(t)) n 0| < 3.
Therefore,

Proof If M(t, x) is n0-order normal, then every element mij (t, x) satisfies Defini­

On the other hand, if M(t, x) is Asn0-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e D, 
by Definition 4.24, for any sequence a с fl, there exists a subsequence a 1 c a

Chapter 5
Almost Automorphic Functions Under
Matched Spaces of Time Scales
In this chapter, based on the theory of matched space of time scales, we develop a 
theory of almost automorphic functions. In Sect. 5.1, a notion of weighted pseudo 
S-almost automorphic functions under matched spaces is introduced and studied. In 
Sect. 5.2, a new generalized type of almost automorphic functions called n0-order 
weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic functions is firstly proposed and some of 
their basic properties are established. Section 5.3 is mainly devoted to establishing 
a theory of discontinuous S-almost automorphic functions through introducing the 
S-equipotentially almost automorphic sequence under S-CCTS.
5.1 Weighted Pseudo 3-Almost Automorphic Functions
Under Matched Spaces
In the following, we always assume that the group (T, F, In*, S) is a regular 
matched space under which T is a periodic time scale. We introduce the concepts of 
S-almost automorphic functions and n0-order A-almost automorphic functions (i.e., 
Asn0-almost automorphic functions).
Definition 5.1
(i) Let f : T ^ X be a bounded continuous function. We say that f is S-almost 
automorphic under the matched space (T, F, In*, S') if for every sequence of 
real numbers {sn}^=1 c fl, we can extract a subsequence {тп}£=1 с П such 
that

B is any bounded subset of X. Denote by AAS (T x X, X) the set of all such

almost automorphic) under the matched space (T, F, In*, S) if there exists 
some i0 > 1, ni e Z, i = 1, 2,..., i0 such that for every sequence of real

5.1 Weighted Pseudo 3-Almost Automorphic Functions Under Matched Spaces
279
We say f is a standard Asn0-almost automorphic function.
We now construct a 3-almost automorphic function through 3-almost periodicity 
under the matched space.
Example 5.1.1 Let T = R and П = [1, +^), and we define the following 
operators:
3At) =
Tt,
t/T,
if t > 0, 
if t<0,
for т e [1, +^) П П*,
and
3T-1(t) =
t/т, if t > 0,
Tt, if t<0,
for т e [1, +^) П П*,
and observe that (T, In*, F, 3) is a matched space of T, where F(A) = | A | for all 
A e T* = R\{0}, П* = (0, +x.).
Step 1. Periodic function construction. We know that the set of reals R is 
periodic under the matched space (T, In*, F, 3). The function
fT (t) = cos
ln 1t1 
ln (1 / jr) п I, т > 1 and t e T* = R\{0}
is periodic under (T, In*, F, 3) with the period т = P2, P > 1 since
fr(3T ±1 (t) =
fr(tP±2), if t > 0,
fr(t/P±2), if t< 0,

where P 1 = P2, P 1, P2 > 1 and t e T* = R\{0}. We observe that F(t) is 
almost periodic under the matched space (T, In*, F, 8). From Step 1, let
( ln |^2t| A 
( ln |^3t |
fP12 (^2t) = co^inWn), fP22 (V3t) = co^ln^jП
we obtain that F(t) = fP^2 (V2t) + fP^2 (V3t), and note that fP^2 and fP^2 are 
periodic with different periods P12, P22, respectively (see Fig. 5.1).
Step 3. 8-almost automorphic function construction. According to the above, 
consider the function
лF (t) = 1 /
ln |V2t| \

n + cos

ln (1 /P1)-------------- ln (1 /P2 )
where P 1 = P2, P 1, P2 > 1 and t e T* = R\{0}. We observe that F(t) is 
almost automorphic under the matched space (T, In*, F, 8). From Step 2, we 
obtain F (t) = fP^2 ( +fP22 (Лt) ( see Fig. 52 ).
Next, we construct a ^8-almost automorphic function through Д^-almost peri­
odicity.

Example 5.1.2
Step 1. A'i -periodic function construction. For any a e R\{0}, the real-valued
function f(t) = a/t defined on (47)Z = {(47)n, n e Z} is Л-periodic under 
the matched space (T, In*, F, i) with the period т = 47 since
f (3( P7, ±. v))34, ±1 (t) = 4±t (47) ±‘ = -t = f(t).
Step 2. V -almost periodic function construction. On the time scale (47)Z = 
{(47)n, n e Z}, let a, b e R\{0}, a = b and
g 1 (t)

<5 (t) = g 1 (t) + g 2 (t) = + +------- 10„

t 
(-1) log77 tt
From Step 1, we observe that g 1 (i(^7)±1 (t^i^)±1 (t) = g 1 (t) and we note that

Hence, G(t) is a ^-almost periodic function under the matched space 
(T, In*, F, 8'). Note that g 1 (t) and g2(t) have completely different periods.
Step 3. A;j -almost automorphic function construction. According to Step 2, 
and on the time scale (V7)Z = {(V7)n, n e Z}, consider the following function:
лG(t) = 1 / t + ( — 1) logV7 tt
a,be R\{0}, a = b.
We observe that G (t) is almost automorphic under the matched space 
(T, In*, F, 8). From Step 2, we obtain that G(t) = g^■ 
□
Remark 5.2 From Examples 5.1.1-5.1.2, one can see that Definitions 5.1 and 5.2 
not only include the concepts of almost automorphic functions on periodic time 
scales under translations but also cover some new types of almost automorphic 
functions, so almost automorphic problems for q -difference equations and other 
more general dynamic equations on quantum-like time scales such as (—q)Z, —qZ, 
etc., can be proposed and studied.
Let X be a Banach space endowed with the norm || • ||. We denote by B(X, Y) the 
Banach space of all bounded linear operators from X to Y. This is simply denoted 
as B(X) when X = Y. BC(T, X) is the space of bounded continuous function from 
T to X equipped with the supremum norm defined by || u ||TO = supteT || u(t) ||.
Lemma 5.1 AA8(T, X) equipped with the norm || • ||TO is a Banach space.
Proof Let {fn} c AA8(T, X) be a Cauchy sequence. Since X is a Banach space, 
we can obtain fn ^ f, n ^ rc>. Hence, for any e > 0, there is a Ni > 0 so that 
n > N 1 implies || fn(t) — f(t)||TO < e. Because {fn} c AA&(T, X), for each n e N 
and e > 0, there exist a N2 > 0 and the sequence {gn} so that n > N2, for any 
sequence {тк} c fl, there is a subsequence {Tn} such that
sup || fn (8tn (t)) — gn(t)\\ < e. 
teT*
Now, take N3 = max{N 1, N2}, and when n > N3, we obtain
|| f (8m (t)) — gn(t)|| < || f (8m (t)) — fn (8m (t) )|| + || fn (8m (t)) — gn(t)|| < 2 e.
(5.1)

5.1 Weighted Pseudo 3-Almost Automorphic Functions Under Matched Spaces
283
Moreover, since {fn} is convergent, then {gn} is also convergent, say gn(t) — g(t) 
as n — ж. From (5.1), we have || f(8Tn (t) - g(t) || < 2e, which means that 
f e AA. Hence, AA3 is a Banach space equipped with the norm || • ||ж. This 
completes the proof. 
□
Let U be the set of all functions p : T — (0, ж) which are positive and locally 
integrable over T.
For a given r e [en*, +ж) П П := fl+, 10 e T, set
Г 3r(t 0) 
m8 (t0, r, p) := 
p(s)As, 
(5.2)
3r-1(t0)
for each p e U.
Remark 5.3 Under a regular matched space (T, F, In*, 3), from Definition 4.3, we 
have F([8r-1 (t0), 3r(t0)]T) = [3(r-1, F(Ait0)), 3(r, F(Ait0))]n*, i.e.,
[8r-1 (t0), 8r(t0)]T = F-1([8(r-1, F(Ait0)), 8(r, F(Ait0))]n*).
In particular, if F(Ait0) = en*, then [8r-1 (t0), 8rtt0)]T = F-1 ([r-1, r]n*), and in 
this case, we say (5.2) is the standard weighted function and
m8(t0, r, p) := m8(r, p) = j 
p(s)As. 
(5.3)
Throughout the section, we assume that (T, F, In*, 8) is a regular matched space 
and employ the standard weighted function (5.3).
Remark 5.4 For any fixed 10 e T and т e R, if r — ж, then 8r(t0) — ж and 
8(т, r) — те. Hence, under a regular matched space (T, F, In*, 8), it follows that 
mes( F-1 ([ r-1 ,r ] n *)) := ^л (F-1 ([ r-1 ,r ] n *)) -ж if r ^ те.
Define
Uж := {p e U : lim m8(r, p) = ж} 
r —ж
and
UB := {p e Uж : p is bounded and inf p(s) > 0}. 
seT
It is clear that UB c Uж C U.
Now for p e Uж define
PAA0(T,p) := f e BC(T, X) :

Proof Let {fn} be a Cauchy sequence in PAA0(T, X). Then for any e > 0, there is 
a N>0 such that n,m > N implies
II fn(t) - fm(t) II <e.
Since X is a Banach space, we have || fn - f ||TO ^ 0 as n ^ ж. Therefore, from 
the definition of PAAS0, we obtain

Definition 5.3 The sets WPAAS(T, p) and WPAAS(T x X, p) of standard 
weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic functions are introduced as follows:
WPAAS(T, p) = {f e BC(T, X) : f = g + ф, g e AAS(T, X)
and ф e PAAS0 (T, p)};
WPAAS(T x X, p) = {f e BC(T x X, X) : f = g + ф, g e AAS(T x X, X) 
and ф e PAAS0 (T x X, p)}.
From the definition of WPAAS(T, X), we will prove the following lemma.

5.1 Weighted Pseudo 3-Almost Automorphic Functions Under Matched Spaces

Lemma 5.3 Let (T,F, IП* ,8) be a regular matched space and 8т(•) be Д-

By Lemma 5.3, we will establish the following completeness and composition 
theorems of the function spaces.
Theorem 5. 1 Let (T,F, In* ,8) be a regular matched space. Assume that 
PAA0(T, P) is shift invariant under the matched space (T, F, In* ,8). Then 
the decomposition of a weighted pseudo 8-almsst automorphic function as 
AA8 ф PAA0 is unique for any p e Uж.
Proof Assume that f = g 1 + ф 1 and f = g2 + ф2. Then 0 = (g 1 - g2) + (ф 1 - ф2). 
Since g 1 - g 2 e AA8( T, X), and ф 1 - ф 2 e PAAS0 (T, p), and in view of Lemma 5.3, 
we deduce that g1 - g2 = 0. Consequently, ф1 - ф2 = 0, that is, ф1 = ф2 . The 
proof is completed. 
□
Theorem 5. 2 Let (T, F, In* ,8) be a regular matched space. Assume that 
PAAS0(T, p) is shift invariant and p e Uж. Then (WPAAS(T, p), || • ||TO) is 
a Banach space.
Proof Assume that {fn}neN is a Cauchy sequence in WPAAS(T, p). We can write 
uniquely fn = gn + фп. Using Lemma 5.3, we see that ||gp - gq ||TO < || fp - fq ||TO, 
from which we deduce that {gn}neN is a Cauchy sequence in the Banach space 
AA8(T, X). Thus, фп = fn - gn is also a Cauchy sequence in the Banach space 
PAA0(T, p). We deduce that gn ^ g e AA&(T, X), фп ^ ф e PAA&
0(T, p), and 
finally fn ^ g + ф e WPAAS(T, p). The proof is completed.

Definition 5.4 Let p 1, p2 e Uж. One says that p 1 is equivalent to p2, denoting this 
p1
as p 1 ~ p2 if e UB.
p2
Let p 1, p2, p3 e Uж. It is clear that p 1 < p 1 (reflexivity); if p 1 < p2, then 
P2 < P 1 (symmetry), and if p 1 < p2 and p2 < p3, then p 1 < p3 (transitivity). Thus, 
< is a binary equivalence relation on Uж.

In the following result we shall assume that:
(H1) f(t, x) is uniformly continuous in any bounded subset K с X uniformly in 
t e T.
(H2) g(t, x) is uniformly continuous in any bounded subset K с X uniformly in 
t e T.
Theorem 5.4 Let f = g + ф e WPAAs(T x X, p) where g e AAS(T x X, X), 
ф e PAA0(T x X, p), p e UTO. Assume that (H1) and (H2) are satisfied. Then the 
L(•) := f (., h(•)) e WPAAs(T, p) if h e WPAAs(T, p).
Proof Let f = g + ф where g e AA3 (T x X, X) and ф e P AA30(T x X,p) and
h = д0 + v0 where д0 e AAS(T, X) and v0 e PAA0(T, p). Now, L(•) can be
expressed as
L(•) = g (‘, д0(•)) + f (‘, h(•)) — g (‘, д0(•))
= g (•, д 0 (•) ) + f (•, h( •) ) - f (•, д 0 (•) ) + ф (•, д 0 (•) ).
From Lemma 5.5, g(•, д0(•)) e AAS(T, X). Consider now the function
П•) := f (• ,h(•)) - f (• ,д0(•)).
Clearly &(t) e BC(T, X). For & to be in PAA0(T, p), it is sufficient to show that

Thus, P e PAA0(T, X).
Finally, we need to show that ф(■, p0(•)) e PAA0(T, p). Note that ф(1, p0(t) 
is uniformly continuous on F-1 ([r-1 ,r]n*), and that p0(F-1([r-1 ,r]n*)) is 
compact since p0 is continuous on T as a 3-almost automorphic function. Thus 
m
given s > 0, there exists S * > 0 such that p0 (F-1 ([r-1, r]n*)) c U Bk where 
k=1
Bk = {x e X : IIx - xk|| < S*} for some xk e pо(F-1([r-1, r]n*)), and
||ф(^о(t)) - ф^Р|| <2, pо(t) e Bk,t e F-1 ([r-1 ,r]n*). 
(5.4)
It is easy to see that the set Uk := {t e F 1 ([r 1, r]n*) : p0(t) e Bk} is open in
F-1 ([r-1 ,r]n*) and that F-1 ([r-1 ,r]n*) = U Uk. Define Vk by
k=1 
k-1
V1 = U1, Vk = Uk\ U Ui, 2 < k < m.
i = 1
Then it is clear that Vi П Vj = 0, if i = j, 1 < i, j < m. Thus we get
Y := jt e F-1 ([r-1, r]n*) : ||ф(t, pо(t))|| > |
c U 11 e Vk : IIф(г, p0(t)) - ф^^)II + IIф(t,Xk)II > s
c U({t e Vk : ||ф(t, pо(t)) - ф^^)|| > 2 JU{t e Vk : IIф(t,xk)II > 2
In view of (5.4), it follows that
s

Thus we get

5.2 n0-Order Weighted Pseudo A-Almost Automorphic 
Functions
In the following section, we shall assume that the group (T, F, In*, 8) is a regular 
matched space of T which is a periodic time scale in the sense of Definition 3.21. 
For simplicity, we use the notation 8T(t) := 8(т, t) for any т e П*. In addition, 
fl П (-Ж, en*] := fl~ and fl П [en*, +ж) := fl+.
Under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8), for convenience, we denote Ait the sub­
timescale which the argument t belongs to, and clearly, it e I1, where I1 is an index 
set satisfying T = UieI 1 Ai• If 8A(t) (т < еП*) exists and is bounded, then &A 
denotes its upper bound.
Lemma 5.6 If the time scale T is periodic in the sense of Definition 3.21 and 
(T, F, In*, 8) is a regular matched space, then for any fixed point 10 e T, there 
exists a suitable adjoint mapping F : T ^ П such that F (Ai ) = en*.
Proof Since the time scale T is periodic in the sense of Definition 3.21, then en* is 
also the identity element in fl.
From Definition 3.21, there exists an inverse element [F(Ai)]-1 e П such that 
3([F(Ai )]-1, F(Ai) = en*, so there exists a suitable constant b e П* such 
that 3(b, F(AitQ)) = (F ◦ 8b)(Ai^) := F(Aito) = en*. In fact, from condition 
(1) of Definition 4.3, let b = [F(Ai^)]-1 e П, and we have 8i(b, F(Ai^)) = 
F(8[F(Ak )]-1 (Ait0)) = еП*. Thus, we have F = F ◦ 8[F(A^ )]-i. This completes 
the proof.

Remark5.5 From condition (3) in Definition 4.3, if F(Ai^) = en* for a fixed 
10 e T, then it follows that F(Ait) < en* for t < t0 and F(Ait) > en* for t > t0.
According to Definitions 5.1 and 5.2, the classical concept of almost automorphic 
functions can be derived.
Remark 5.6
Definition 5.5 (Case I. T = R)
(i) Let f : R ^ X be a bounded continuous function. f is said to be almost 
automorphic if for every sequence of real numbers {sn}n=1, one can extract a 
subsequence {Tn}n=1 such that
g(t) = lim f (t + Tn) 
n ^TO
is well defined for each t e R and
lim g(t - Tn) = f(t) 
n ^TO
for each t e R.
(ii) A continuous function f : R x X ^ X is said to be almost automorphic if 
f(t, x) is almost automorphic in t e R uniformly for all x e B, where B is 
any bounded subset of X.
Definition 5.6 (Case II. T = hZ)
(i) Let f : hZ ^ X be a bounded continuous function. f is said to be almost 
automorphic if for every sequence of real numbers {sn}TO=1 C hZ, one can 
extract a subsequence {Tn }nTO=1 such that
g(t) = lim f(n0 + Tn) 
n ^TO
is well defined for each n0 e hZ and
lim g(n0 - Tn) = f(t) 
n ^TO
for each n0 e hZ.
(ii) A continuous function f : hZ x X ^ X is said to be almost automorphic if 
f(t, x) is almost automorphic in n0 e hZ uniformly for all x e B, where B is 
any bounded subset of X.
Theorem 5.5 Let T be a periodic time scale in the sense of Definition 3.21, 
f : T ^ X be a bounded continuous function, and ST(•) be A-differentiable 
in its second argument. Then f is n0-order A-almost automorphic ( An0-almost 
automorphic) under the matched space (T, F, In*, &) if and only if there exists

R. : T ^ T is a one-to-one mapping. In fact, from (P1) in Definition 3.13, note

Let X be a Banach space endowed with the norm || • ||. We denote by B(X, Y) the 
Banach space of all bounded linear operators from X to Y. This is simply denoted 
as B(X) when X = Y. BC(T, X) is the space of bounded continuous function from 
T to X equipped with the supremum norm defined by || u ||TO = supteT || u(t) ||.
Lemma 5.7 If 8т(•) is Д-differentiable and 8Д(•) < 8Д for any т e fl~, where 8Д 
is a positive constant, then AA”0 (T, X) equipped with the norm || • ||TO is a Banach 
space.
Proof Let {fn} c AA”0 (T, X) be a Cauchy sequence. Since X is a Banach space, 
we obtain fn ^ f, n ^ те. Hence, for any е > 0, there is a NN 1 > 0 so that n > N 1 
implies || fn(t) - f(t)||TO < е. Because {fn} c AA”0(T, X), for each n e N and 
е > 0, there exists a N2 > 0 and {gn} so that n > N2, for any sequence {тк} c П—, 
there is a subsequence {rn} such that
I fn(8m(t))(8Д(t))”0 - S””0(t)IL < е. 
(5.9)
Now, take N3 = max{N 1, N2}, and when n > N3, from (5.9), we obtain
I f (8m (t))(8Д (t)) ” 0 — S , (t) IL

I f (8T” (t) )(8Д (t) ) ” 0 — fn (8?n (t) )(8Д (t) ) ” .

We take n = N3 + 1 such that
lim f(8T.(t))(8Д(t))”0 = S" 1.,ni0(t), 
fl^^ T”

gN3+1 V ,
which means that f e AA8n0 . Hence, AA8n0 is a Banach space equipped with the
norm || • ||TO.

standard weighted function (5.3).

For any function f e BC(T, X), we use the notation Sf0 := f (t) (bA t (t))n0.

UB := P e Uro : P is bounded and inf P(s) > 0 .

Lemma 5.8 If 8т(•) is A-differentiable and bA(•) < 8'A for any т e fl~, where 
A is a positive constant, then PAA80,n0 (T, X) equipped with the norm || • ||ro is a 
Banach space.
Proof Let {fn} be a Cauchy sequence in PAAS0,n0 (T, X). Then for any e > 0, there 
is a N>0 such that n, m > N implies
IISf0 (t) - Sfm (t) II < II fn(t) - fm(t) II • (8An. (t))n0 < (8B)n0e,
which indicates that {Sfn0 } is also a Cauchy sequence. Since X is a Banach space, 
we have || Sf0 (t) - Sf0 (t) ||ro ^ 0 as n ^ ro. Therefore, from the definition of 
PAAS0,n0, we obtain f e PAAS0,n0. This completes the proof.

and ф e PAA0,g0 (T x X, p) J ,
and we say Sfg0 is the main part of f .
From the definition of WPAAn0 (T, X), we will prove the following lemma.
Lemma 5.9 Let (T, F, In*, 8) be a regular matched space and 8(t, •) be A-

and ф e PAA0,n0(T, p) where p e UTO, then Sf0(T) c Sf0(T).
Proof We prove it by contradiction. Assume that the claim does not hold. Then 
there exist a 10 e T and e > 0 such that ||Sg(t0) - Sf (t)|| > 2e, t e T. Since 
g e AAg0 (T, X), fix 10 e T and e > 0 and set

Proof Assume that Sf0 — Sn10 + Sn0 and Sf0 — Sg20 + Sn' • Then 0 — (Sn10 - Sg20) + 
S0 - Sn0)• Since Sgni0 - Sg20 e SAAn0(t,X), and Sn - Sn0 e SpAAp0(t,p), and in 
view of Lemma 5.3, we deduce that Sn0 - Sg20 — 0• Consequently, Sf 0 - Sn — 0,

Finally, we need to prove that f(t, Sf0(t)) e PAA0,n0(T, p). Note
that Snn0(t, Sf00(t)) is uniformly continuous on F-1 ([r-1 ,r]n*), and that 
Sf00 (F-1 ([r-1 ,r]П*)) is compact since f0 is continuous on T as an almost 
automorphic function. Thus given s > 0, there exists S* > 0 such that 
Sfn00(F-1 ([r-1 ,r]n*)) c -Bk where Bk = {x e X : ||x - xk|| < S*} for

5 Almost Automorphic Functions Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
5.3 Discontinuous Weighted Pseudo S-Almost Automorphic 
Functions
In this section, we will introduce some concepts of complete-closed time 
scales under non-translational shifts (or S-CCTS for short) and then define S- 
equipotentially almost automorphic sequence and study its properties.
5.3.1
S-Equipotentially Almost Automorphic Sequence Under
S-CCTS
For convenience, we introduce the notations. Let T* be the largest open subset of T, 
i.e., T* = T.
D± = {(s, t) e T* x T* : 3±(5, t) e T*}.
For any s e T*, denote
T*s- := 3-(s, T*) := {3-(s,t) : (s,t) e D-, Vt e T*}, 
(5.11)
T*s + := 3 + (s, T*) := {3 + (s,t) : (s,t) e D+, Vt e T*}. 
(5.12)
Definition 5.9 (see [199]) Let T be a time scale with the shift operators 3± 
associated with the initial point t0 e T* . The time scale T is said to be bi-direction 
S-CCTS in shifts 3± if
П± := {p e T* : (p,t) e D± for all t e T*} £ {{t0}, 0}. 
(5.13)
Remark 5.8 Note that from (5.11) and (5.12), we obtain that (5.13) can be written 
into the equivalent form П± = {p e T* : T*p± c T*} £ {{10}, 0}.
Example 5.3.1 According to Definition 5.9, we provide the following examples of 
5-CCTS. Let T = (-q)Z = {(-q)n : q > 1, n e Z} U {0}. We can obtain that 
П± = {(-q)2n : q > 1, n e Z. For such a time scale, for any t e T*, take 10 = 1, 
we attach the shift operators
3+ (s, t) =
st, t > 0,
Ls, t < 0,
3- (s, t) =
7, t > 0, 
st, t < 0.

5.3 Discontinuous Weighted Pseudo S-Almost Automorphic Functions
305
Hence, there exists q2 e П± such that S±(q2, t) e T* for all t e T*, i.e., П± e 
{{1}, 0}. From Definition 5.9, T is a S-CCTS with bi-direction. 
□
Remark 5.9 Note that if T is a periodic time scales under translations and П± c 
T*, then the shift operators will fulfill S± (t, t) = t ± т e T with the initial point 
tо = 0. Hence, if П± c T*, then T-CCTS is included in S-CCTS.
If T is a bi-direction S-CCTS and 10 is the initial point, then for any s e П±, we 
define a function A : П± ^ П±,
A(s) =
S+ (s, t0), 
s > t0,
S-(s, t0), 
s < t0,
which will be used later. Note that A(s) > t0 and A(s) > s.
Remark 5.10 If П± c T* and S±(s, 10) = s ± 10, let 10 = 0, then one can easily 
obtain A(s) =|s |.
In what follows, we will demonstrate some examples to show the almost 
automorphic phenomena for functions on S-CCTS which are completely different 
from the cases on periodic time scales under translations.
Example 5.3.2 Let T = R and П
[0, +^), and we define the following
operators:
S+(t, t) =
tt, 
t/t,
if t > 0, 
if t<0,
for т e [1, +^) А П,
and
S-(t, t) =
t/t, if t > 0, 
tt, if t<0,
for т e [1, +^) А П.
Step 1. Periodic function construction. We know that the set of reals R is
periodic under shifts S± . The function
fr(t) = cos
ln |1| 
--------^n , 
ln(1 / t) ,
т > 1 and t e T* = R\{0}
is periodic under shifts S± with the period т = P 2 , P > 1 since

MtP ±2), if t > 0,
Mt/P±2), if t < 0,

where P 1 = P2, P 1, P2 > 1 and t e T* = R\{0}. We observe that F(t) is 
almost periodic under shifts S±. From Step 1, let
i- (ln |V211 \ r- 
(ln |V31I \
fP2(V2t) = Klna/wn)'fP2^3t) =cos (.lnwPy4
we obtain that F(t) = fP2 (V2t) + fP^2 (V3t), and note that fP2 and fP^2 are 
periodic with different periods P12, P22, respectively.
Step 3. 
S -almost automorphic function construction. According to the above,
consider the function
F(t) = cos

ln(1/P2)
where P 1 = P2, P 1, P2 > 1 and t e T* = R\{0}. We observe that F(t)
is almost automorphic under shifts S±. From Step 2, we obtain that F(t) =
c^ (2+ fP22 (V21)+fP2. (x 31^ •
Example 5.3.3 The time scale qZ = {qn : n e Z and q = ^3} U {0} is periodic 
with period т under the shift operator S±.
Step 1. Periodic function construction. The piecewise periodic function is 
defined by
ln t
f1 (t) = [0(t)]ln q,
ln qt
f2(t) = [0(t^ lnq, 0(t) =
1, 
t>1,
-1, 0 <t< 1.
Let т = q4 and S± (т, t) = q±4t e qZ \{0} = qZ, and we have f1 S± (т, t) = 
ln t 
ln t
[0(t)]lnq 
= [0(t)]lnq = f1 (t) for all t e qZ. Hence, f1 (t) is aperiodic
function with period q4. Similarly, let т = q5, and we obtain f2 S± (т, t) = 
f2(t).

5.3 Discontinuous Weighted Pseudo S-Almost Automorphic Functions

Step 2. Almost periodic function construction.
Through Step 1, we obtain an almost periodic piecewise function
lnt 
W
F(t) = f1 (t) + f2 (t) = [0(t)]ln q + [0(t)]ln q
on qZ, where f1, f2 are periodic piecewise function on qZ, respectively. Note 
that the periods of f1 and f2 are completely different.
Step 3. Almost automorphic function construction.

F (t) =

Let
B = 
{tk} : tk e T : tk +1 > tk, k e Z, lim tk = ±ro}
k ^±m
with 0 = infkez 3- (tk, tk +i) > 0.
Next, based on Definition 5.9, we will introduce the concept of S-equipotentially 
almost automorphic sequence and study its properties.
Definition 5.10 Assume T is S-CCTS with shifts 3± .Let{tk}eB,ke Z. We say 
{tkj } is a S-derivative sequence of {tk} and
tkj = 3- (tk, tk+j), k, j e Z.
Remark 5.11 If T is a periodic time scale under translations, then we obtain the 
classical derivative sequence of {tk} satisfying tkj = tk+j - tk by letting 3± (s, t) = 
t ± s. Particularly, if T = R, we obtain the derivative sequence of {tk} from [169] 
(pp. 191-194) immediately.
Based on the S-derivative sequence and its properties, we propose the following 
definition.
Definition 5.11 Let T be a S-CCTS under shifts 3± and tkj = 3- (tk, tk+j ), k, j e 
Z. The sequence {tkj},k,je Z is said to be S-equipotentially almost automorphic 
if for any sequence {sn} c Z, there exists a subsequence {sn} such that
lim tksn 
n ^m k = Yk
is well defined for each k e Z and

308
5 Almost Automorphic Functions Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
lim Y- sn = tk 
n ^TO
for each k e Z.
Remark 5.12 In Definition 5.11, note that T is a closed subset of R; thus, for each 
k e Z, one has Yk e T.
5.3.2 S-Almost Automorphic Functions and Weighted Pseudo 
S-Almost Automorphic Functions
In the following, we will give the definition of rd -piecewise continuous functions 
on time scales.
Definition 5.12 We say y : T ^ X is rd -piecewise continuous with respect 
to a sequence {tk} c T which satisfy tk < tk +1, k e Z, if y(t) is continuous 
on [tk, tk+1)T and rd-continuous on T\{tk}. Furthermore, [tk, tk+1)T are called 
intervals of continuity of the function y(t).
For convenience, P Crd (T, X) denotes the set of all rd-piecewise continuous 
functions with respect to a sequence {tk}, k e Z. For {tk}keZ e B, let
BPCrd(T, X) =: {ф e PCrd(T, X) :
||ф|| < M, where M is a positive constant and ф^к) = ф(^+ ),k e Z};
let Q be a subset of X and
BPCrd(.T X Q, X) =: {ф e PCrd(T x Q, X) :
||ф|| < M, where M is a positive constant and ф(}к, x) = ф(^+, x), k e Z, ф^, •) 
is continuous at x e Q for anyt e T ;
UPC(T, X) =: {^ e PCrd(T, X) :
Ф is uniformly rd-continuous on the interval [tk,tk +1) T for k e Z}.
Remark5.13 y e Crd(T, X) is uniformly rd-continuous on the interval [a, b]T if 
and only if for any e > 0, there exists 8(e) > 0 such that for all right dense points 
t1 ,t2 e T and 1t1 -12| < 8 implies ||^(t 1) — y(t2) || < e (see Definition 2.1 of [125]).

Now, let T, P e B and let s(T U P) : B ^ B be a map such that the set 
s(T U P) forms a strictly increasing sequence. For D c T and v > 0, we introduce 
the notations 0v(D) = {3-(v, t), t e D}, Fv(D) = D П {0v(D)}. Denote by ф — 
(y(t), T) the element from the space PCrd( T, X) x B. For every sequence of real 
numbers {sn} c П±, n = 1, 2,... with 0sn<j> :— (<p(8 + (sn, t)), S-(sn, T)), we shall 
consider the sets {^(S + (sn, t)), S-(sn, T^ c PCrd x B, where
S - (sn, T) = {S - (sn, tk) : k e Z ,n = 1, 2,...}.
Definition 5.13 The sequence {фn}, фn = (yn(t), Tn) e PCrd(T, X) x B is 
convergent to ф* pointwise, ф* = (p*(t), T*), (p*(t), T*) e PCrd(T, X) x B, 
if and only if for any e > 0 there exists nо > 0 such that n > nо implies
d(Tn,T*) < e, ||^n(t) - p*(t)|| < e pointwise
for t e T\Fe(s(Tn U T*)); d(•, •) is an arbitrary distance in B.
For convenience, consider the metric space BPCrd (T, X) x B with the metric 
dm = sup d(фt, ф*),
teT\B
where
d(фt, ф*) = max {d(T, T*), ||v(t) - <p*(t)||},
and ф= (y(t),T), ф* = (<p*(t),T*).
Theorem 5.10 The metric space BPPCrd(T, X) x B, dTO) is complete.
Proof For any given Cauchy sequence {фn = (^n(t), Tn)} c BPCrd(T, X) x B, 
we can obtain that the sequences {yn(t)} and {Tn} are the Cauchy sequences in the 
metric space (BPCrd(T, X), || • ||TO) and (B, d) respectively. Hence, for any e > 0, 
there exists some n0 > 0 such that n, m > n0 implies d(Tn,Tm) < e, which 
yields that |tk(n) - tk(m)| <efor any k e Z. Thus there exists tk such that n>n0 
implies |tk(n) - tk | <e. Therefore, there exists {tk}=T such that n>n0 implies 
d(Tn, T) < e. Moreover, for n>n0, we obtain

For any fixed t e T\Fe (s(Tn U T)), pn (t) c BPCrd (T, X) is a Cauchy sequence 
in the Banach space X; hence for any e > 0, there exists some p(t) e X such that 
n > nо implies
IIpn(t) — p(t)|| < e pointwise. 
(5.14)
We claim that p(t) is also bounded on T\Fe(s(Tn U T). In fact, there exists some 
n0 > 0 such that n, m > n0 implies ||pn — pm ||x < 1, so for all t e T\Fe(s(TnUT) 
we have
|p(t) | < |p(t) — Vn0 (t) | + |Pn0 (t) | < IIp — Pn0 x + IIPn0

To complete the proof, it is sufficient to show pn ^ p in norm on T\Fe(s(Tn U 
T)}, i.e., ||p — pn || ^ 0 as n ^ x. According to (5.14), there exists some n0 > 0 
such that n, m > n0 implies

Definition 5.14 Let T be a bi-direction S-CCTS and T = {tk} be a 5- 
equipotentially almost automorphic sequence; we have the following definitions.
(i) Let p e BPCrd(T, X) be a bounded function with respect to a sequence T = 
{tk}. Then p is said to be rd-piecewise 5-almost automorphic if from every 
sequence {sn}n=1 c П±, we can extract a subsequence {Tn}n=1 such that

for each t e T. We denote by AAS(T, X) the set of all such functions.
(ii 
) A bounded function f e BPCrd(T x X, X) with respect to a sequence T = 
{tk} is said to be rd-piecewise S-almost automorphic if f(t, x) is piecewise S- 
automorphic in t e T uniformly for x e B, where B is any bounded subset of 
X. We denote by AAS (T x X, X) the set of all such functions.
Similarly, we can also introduce the concept of piecewise S-almost automorphic 
functions which belong to P Crd(T, X).
Let U be the set of all functions p : T ^ (0, to) which are positive and locally 
A-integrable over T. For a given r e (0, to)n± and V10 e T*, set
Г 8 +(r,t 0 )
ms(r,p,t0) := 
p(s)As 
(5.15)
8- (r,t0)
for each p e U.
Remark 5.14 Particularly, if we let T = {qn : n e Z ,q > 1} U {0} and t0 = q, 
then (5.15) will turn into the integral on the quantum time scale:
r qr
ms(r,p,t0) := I p(s)As.
r
Moreover, let T = {±Vn : n e N} and 10 = 1, then the integral is

ms(r, p,t0) := I p___ p(s)As.

Define

We are now ready to introduce the sets WPAAS(T,p)and WPAAS(T x X,p) 
of weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic functions:
WPAAs(T, p) = f = g + ф e BPCrd(T, X) :
g e AAs(T, X) andф e WPAAS(T, p)},
WPAAS(T x X,p)= f = g +ф e BPCrd(T x X,X) : g e AAS(T x X,X) 
andф e WPAAS(T x X, p)}.
Lemma 5.12 Let T be bi-direction S-CCTS under shifts S± and ф e BPCrd (T, X). 
Then ф e WPAA S( T, p) where p e UB if and only if for every e > 0,

(a) Necessity. For contradiction, suppose that there exists e0 > 0 such that

Then there exists S>0 such that for every n e N,

By Definition 5.14, the following two lemmas are obvious.
Lemma 5.14 Let T be bi-direction S-CCTS under shifts 3± and ф e AAS(T, X), 
then the range of ф, ф(T), is relatively compact subset of X.
Lemma 5.15 Let T be bi-direction S-CCTS under shifts 3 ± .If f = g + ф with 
g e AAS(T, X), and ф e WPAAS(T, p), where p e UB, then g(T) c f(T).
Lemma 5.16 Let T be bi-direction S-CCTS under shifts 3±. The decomposition of 
a weighted piecewise pseudo S-almost automorphic function according to AAS ф 
WPAA S is unique for any p e UB.
Proof Let f e WPAAs(T, p), if f = g 1 + ф 1 = g2 + ф2, then we have g 1 — g2 =

Lemma 5.17 Let {pn} c AAS(T, X) be a sequence of piecewise S-almost 
automorphic functions such that limn^OT pn = p uniformly, then p is piecewise 
S-almost automorphic.
Proof From Definition 5.14, let фn = (pn(t), Tn), ф* = (p(t), T) and {r'n} be
an arbitrary sequence of real numbers. Then we can extract a subsequence {Tn} of 
{ rn} c П± such that
~ 
~ u, 
....
nlm^ 'лф i = <Ф *’ 
(5.16)
for each i = 1, 2, ... , pointwise.
We claim that the sequence of functions {ф*} is a Cauchy sequence. In fact, we 
can obtain
d(Фf, Ф*) < d(фf, 0tK4>i) + d(ФпФi, $гпФj) + <d(ФпФj, ф;)• 
(5.17)
Let e > 0. By the uniform convergence of {ф>n}, there exists a positive integer N 
such that for all i, j > N implies d(6Tn<j>i, 6Tn<j> j) < e. By using (5.16), (5.17), and 
the completeness of the space X, we can deduce the pointwise convergence of the 
sequence {фn}, say to a function ф>.
Now, we claim that limn^ж фTn = ф>* and limn^ж ф>—Tn = ф pointwise on T.
Let e>0; there exists some positive integer M such that
d(0rn4>’в^фm) < e
and ci(фM, ф*) < e pointwise so that
d(ф>rn, ф>*) < 2e + cl(eTndj>m, dj>M) pointwise,
since for each M, there exists some positive integer K = K(t, M) such that

d (втпФ м,Ф M )<e;
thus it follows that d(фTn, ф*) < 3e for n > N0, where N0 is some positive integer 
depending on t and e.
Similarly, the same step can be applied for limn^от ф-Tn = ф pointwise on T; 
thus, the desired result follows. This completes the proof.

By Lemmas 5.18 and 5.12, the following theorem follows.
Theorem 5.13 Let T be bi-direction S-CCTS under shifts S± and f = g + ф e

(ii) f(t, •), g(t, •) are uniformly continuous in each bounded subset of Q uni­
formly in t e T.
Then f (•, h(•)) e WPAAS(T, p) if h e WPAAS(T, p) and h(T) c Q.
Theorem 5.13 has the following consequence.
Corollary 5.3 Let f = g+ф e WPAAS(T, p), where p e UB. Assume that f and 
g are Lipschitzian in x e X uniformly in t e T. Then f (•, h(•)) e WPAAS(T, p)

5 Almost Automorphic Functions Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
Lemma 5.19 Let T be bi-direction S-CCTS under shifts 8 ± .If v e PCrd( T, X) is 
an S-almost automorphic function with respect to the sequence T and {tk} c T is 
S-equipotentially almost automorphic satisfying infkeZ t% = 0 > t0,q e Z, where 
10 is an initial point, then {H4)} is an S-almost automorphic sequence in X.
Proof Let tkj = 8- (tk, tk+j), k, j e Z. Obviously, from the definition of 
П±, it is easy to see that tj e П±. Since v e PCrd(T, X) is an S-almost 
automorphic function and {tk}cT is S-equipotentially almost automorphic, from 
Definitions 5.11 and 5.14, for any sequence {sn} c Z, there exists a subsequence 
{s„} such that
lim (v(t,^_ , ),8-(ts,n,T)) = lim (v(8 + (ts,n,tk)), 8-(ts,n,T))

noting that n ^ ж implies n0 ^ ж; since f e WPAAS(T, p), it follows from 
inequality (5.20) that f (tn) = an e WPAAS(Z, p). This completes the proof. □
In view of Lemma 5.20, the following theorem is immediate.
Theorem 5.14 Let T be bi-direction S-CCTS under shifts S± and S + be Д- 
differentiable to its second argument with S^(s, •) < S+ (s e П-), where 8f is 
a positive number. A necessary and sufficient condition for a bounded sequence 
{an} to be in WPAAS(Z, p) is that there exists a uniformly continuous function 
f e WPAAS( T, p) such that f [ n^n^tf 0) ] = an, 10 e T ,n e Z, p e UB.
Theorem 5.15 Let T be bi-direction S-CCTS under shifts ±± and + + be Л- 
differentiable to its second argument with ++(s, •) < 8^, where 8^ is a positive 
number. Assume that p e UB and the sequence of vector-valued functions {Ik}keZ 
is weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic, i.e., for any x e Q, {Ik(x'),k e Z} is 
weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic sequence. Suppose {Ik (x) : k e Z,x e K} 
is bounded for every bounded subset K c Q, and Ik(x) is uniformly continuous 
in x e Q uniformly in k e Z. If h e WPAAS(T, p) П UPC(T, X) such that 
h( T) c Q, then Ik(h(tk) is a weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic sequence.
Proof Fix h e WPAAS(T, p) П UPC(T, X); first we show h(tk) is weighted 
pseudo S-almost automorphic. Since h = ф 1 + ф2, where ф 1 e AAS(T, X), ф2 e 
WPAAS(T, p). It follows from Lemma 5.19 that the sequence ф 1 (tk) is S-almost 
automorphic. To show h(tk) is weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic, we need to 
show that ф2 (tk) e WPAA0S (Z, p). By the assumption, h, ф1 e UPC(T, X), so is 
ф2. Let 0 < e < 1; there exists S* > 0 such that for t e (tk, tk + S*)t, k e Z, we 
have
IIф2(t)||p(t) > (1 - e)||ф2(tk)||p(tk), k e Z.
Without loss of generality, let tn > t0, t-n <t0,n e Z+; there exists rn, r-n e 
(t0, ж)n± such that S + (rn, 10) = tn, S-(r-n, 10) = t-n. Let rn = max{rn, r-n} e 
П±. Therefore, repeating the proof of Lemma 5.20, we find that h(tk) is weighted 
pseudo S-almost automorphic.
Now, we show Ik h(tk ) is weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic. Let
I(t,x) = Ik(x) + (t - Sk(k)(t0))[Ik +1 (x) - Ik(x)],
Sk(k)(t0) < t < Sk++1 )(t0), k e Z,r e П±, 
r( ) 
r(k+ )

r( ) 
r( + )
Since Ik,h(tk) are two weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic, by Lemma 5.20 and 
Theorem 5.14, we know that I e WPAAS( T x Q,p) Ф 0 e WPAAS( T, p) .For 
every t e T, there exists a number k e Z such that |t - 8^ (t0) | < r,
II I(t,x) II < II Ik(x) II + |t — 8kr(k)(t 0 )|[|| Ir +1 (x) || + || Ir(x) ||] 
< (1 + r)||Ir(x)||+ r||Ik +1 (x)||.
Since {Ik(x) : k e Z, x e K} is bounded for every bounded set K c Q, {I(t, x) : 
t e T, x e K} is bounded for every bounded set K c Q. For every x 1, x2 e Q, we 
have
III(t,x 1) - I(t,x2) II < IIIk(x 1) - Ik(x2) II + It - 8kk(k)(t0)|[||Ik +1 (x 1) - Ik +1 (x2) || 
+ 11 Ik(x 1) - Ik(x2)||]
< (1 + r)||Ik(x 1) - Ik(x2)|| + r ||Ik +1 (x 1) - Ik +1 (x2)||.
Noting that Ik (x) is uniformly continuous in x e Q uniformly in k e Z,we 
then get that I(t,x) is uniformly continuous in x e Q for t e T. Then by 
Theorem 5.13, I(•, Ф0(•)) e WPAAS(T, X). Again, using Lemma 5.20 and 
Theorem 5.14, we have that Iffi^t0), Ф0(S^tt0))) is a weighted pseudo S- 
almost automorphic sequence, that is, Ik h(tk) is weighted pseudo S-almost 
automorphic. This completes the proof. 
□
From Theorem 5.15, one can easily get the following corollary:
Corollary 5.4 Let T be bi-direction S-CCTS under shifts 8± and 8 + be 4- 
differentiable to its second argument with 8 +(s, •) < 8^, where 8^ is a positive 
number. Assume the sequence of vector-valued functions {Ik}keZ is weighted pseudo 
S-almost automorphic, p e UB, if there is a number L>0 such that
IIIk(x) - Ik(y)|| < L||x - y||
for all x,y e Q,k e Z and h e WPAAS( T, p) П UPC( T, p) suchthat h( T) c Q, 
then Ik h(tk) is a weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic sequence.

Chapter 6
C0-Semigroup and Stepanov-Like Almost 
Automorphic Functions on Hybrid Time 
Scales
In this chapter, some basic notions of C0-semigroup and Stepanov-like almost 
automorphic functions in matched spaces of time scales are introduced and studied. 
In Sect. 6.1, the concept of C0-semigroup on a quantum time scale is proposed 
and some basic properties are established. In Sects. 6.2 and 6.3, the notion of the 
Stepanov-like almost automorphic functions is introduced on a quantum time scale 
and their fundamental properties are investigated. Moreover, the weak automorphy 
of such functions in the quantum case is discussed. Sections 6.4 and 6.5 are focused 
on introducing the theory of shift-semigroup and Stepanov-like almost automorphic 
functions under the matched space of time scales.
6.1 C0-Semigroup on a Quantum Time Scale
The П-semigroup for invariant under translations time scales was proposed in the 
literature [181, 203, 205]. In this section, we will introduce the concept of C0-
semigroup on a quantum time scale and study its properties.
Let a quantum time scale Tq = [qn : q > 1, n e Z} and we introduce the
notations T- = {qn : q > 
1, n e Z-}, T+ = {qn : q > 1, n e Z+}, and
Tq = T- U T+ U {1}.
Now, we denote by Tqj. = 
{t • т : t e Tq} and Tq 1 = {t • т-1 : t e Tq} for
т e Tq. Then if т e Tq\{1}, then Tq = Tq, i.e., Tq coincides exactly with Tqj. after
a shift т, we say Tq is invariant with respect to the operation (•).
The following theorem follows by direct calculation check.
Theorem 6. 1 Let Tq be a quantum time scale. Then:
(i) Vт 1, т2 e Tq, we have т 1 • т2 e Tq.
(ii) Vт 1, т2, т3 e Tq, we have (ti • т2) • т3 = т 1 • (т2 • т3).

(iii) There exists an element e = 1 e Tq, such that for all elements т e Tq, the 
equation 1 • т = т • 1 = т holds.
(iv) Vт e Tq, there exists an element т-1 e Tq such that т • т-1 = 1, where 1 is 
the identity element.
(v) Vт 1, т2 e Tq, we have т 1 • т2 = т2 • т 1.
According to Theorem 6.1, the following result follows immediately.
Theorem 6. 2 The pair (Tq, •) forms an Abelian group.
Next, let X be a Banach space and Tт : X ^ X be a transformation for т e Tq. 
Obviously, {Tт : т e Tq} is a set with a single parameter. Then the multiplication is 
defined as follows:
Tт 1Tт2 = Tт 1.т2 , 
(6.1)
which yields that
T т 1 (T т2T т3 ) = (T т1T т2 )T т3 = T т 1. т2. т3,
I = Te is the identity, and Tт—1 is the inverse element of Tт. By these definitions 
and notations, the following theorem is immediate.
Theorem 6. 3 {Tт : т e Tq} forms an Abelian operator group with respect to the 
multiplication defined by (
).
6.1
In view of Theorem 6.3, we will establish some basic concepts which are 
necessary to define a C0-semigroup for a quantum invariant time scale.
Definition 6.1 Let T be a quantum invariant time scale and {Tт} be a collection of 
bounded linear operators on Banach space X. If for all т1, т2 e Tq+ the following 
holds:
T т 1. т2 = T т 1T т2, 
(6.2)
then {Tт : т e T+} is called a single-parameter operator semigroup; if (6.2) holds 
for all т e Tq, we call {Tт : т e Tq} a single-parameter operator group.
Definition 6.2 Let Tq be a quantum time scale and {Tт : т e T+} be an operator 
group on a Banach space X, i.e.,
Tт 1Tт2 = Tт 1.т2, 
т 1 ,т2 e t+ , 
Te = I.
Then {Tт : т e T+} is said to be the strong-continuous operator semigroup or the 
C0-semigroup.
In what follows, we introduce the definition of infinitesimal generator of a C0- 
semigroup on a quantum invariant time scale.

6.2 Stepanov-Like Almost Automorphic Functions on a Quantum Time Scale
325
Definition 6.3 Let Tq be a quantum time scale and {TT : т e T+} be a C0- 
semigroup on a Banach space X.LetD denote a subset ofX, which has the property 
that for each x e D there exists a y e X such that
1
q
1 (Tq - I)x - y
= 0.
(6.3)
We define A : D ^ X satisfying A = q—1 (Tq — I) and Ax = y, where y is fixed 
by (6.3) and A is called the infinitesimal generator of the C0-semigroup.
Theorem 6. 4 Let Tq be a quantum time scale, {Tт : т e T+} be a C0-semigroup on 
Banach space X, and A be the infinitesimal generator of the C0-semigroup. Then A 
is a closed densely defined operator, and for every x e D (A), the following holds:
d- T Tx = A( T rx) = T tAx, 
dqt
that is,
(T xx) — x = 1 A T sx d qs = 1 T sAx d qs,
where D(A) denotes the domain of the operator A.
Proof By Definition 6.3, this theorem is immediate by direct calculation. □
6.2 Stepanov-Like Almost Automorphic Functions on a 
Quantum Time Scale
In this section, we will introduce the concept of Stepanov-like almost automorphic 
functions on a quantum time scale and provide some basic properties.
Definition 6.4 A function f e C(Tq , X), where X is a Banach space, is said to 
be almost automorphic (a.a. for short) in Bochner’s sense if for every sequence of 
(sn) c Tq, there exists a subsequence (sn) such that
g(t) := lim f (t • sn) 
n ^TO
is well defined for each t e Tq , and
nlim g(t • s—) = f(t)
for each t e Tq .

326
6 C0-Semigroup and Stepanov-Like Almost Automorphic Functions on Hybrid. . .
If the convergence above is uniform in t e X, then f is almost periodic in 
the Bochner’s sense. We denote by AAq (X) the collection of all (Bochner) almost 
automorphic functions Tq ^ X. Then similar to the results from literature [67,147], 
we have:
Theorem 6.5 Iff, f1,f2 e AAq(X), then:
(i) 
f1 + f2 e AAq(X).
(ii) 
kf e AAq(X) for any scalar k.
(iii) fa e AAq(X) where fa : Tq ^ X is defined by fa(•) = f (• a).
(iv) 
The range Rf := f(t) : t e Tq is relatively compact in X; thus f is
bounded in norm.
(v) 
If fn ^ f uniformly on Tq where fn e AAq(X), then f e AAq(X).
Proof Similar to the proof process in the literature [67], one can easily prove this 
theorem through replacing the operation + by • and hence it is omitted. 
□
AAq(X) equipped with the sup-norm || f ||AAq(X) = supteTq || f(t)|| turns out to 
be a Banach space. Now we denote by AAqu(X) the closed subspace of all functions 
f e AAq (X) with g e C(Tq, X). Equivalently, f e AAqu(X) if and only if f is 
almost automorphic and all convergence in Definition 6.4 are uniform on compact 
intervals. Obviously, we have
APq(X) C AAu(X) c AAq(X) C BCq(X),
where BCq (X) stands for the Banach space of bounded and continuous functions 
with values in X.
Definition 6.5 The Bochner transform fb(t, s), t e Tq,s e [1,L]Tq, of a function 
f(t) on Tq , with values in X, is defined by
fb(t,s) = f(t • s).
Remark 6.1 A function p(t, s'), t e Tq, s e [1, L]Tq, is the Bochner transform of a 
certain function f(t),
V(t,s) = fb(t,s),
if and only if
<p(t • t, s • т-1) = <p(s, t)
for all t e Tq, s e [1, L ] Tq and т e [sL-1, s ] Tq.
Definition 6.6 Let p e [1, rc>) .The space BSq( X) of Stepanov bounded functions, 
with the exponent p, consists of all measurable functions f on Tq with values in X 
such that fb e L“(Tq, Lp( 1, L; X)). This is a Banach space with the norm:

Definition 6.7 The space ASqp (X) of S p -almost automorphic functions consists of 
all f e BSp(X) such that fb e AAq(Lp( 1, L; X)).
Definition 6.7 also has the following equivalent form.
Definition 6.8 A function f e Llpoc(Tq ; X) is said to be Sp-almost automorphic if 
its Bochner transform fb : Tq i Lp( 1 ,L; X) is almost automorphic in the sense 
that for every sequence of numbers (sn) c Tq, there exist a subsequence (sn) and a 
function g e Llpoc (Tq , X) such that
II f(t • sn • s) - g(t • s) IIpdq^ i 0
and
IIg(t • s-1 • s) - f(t • s) IIpdqs) p i 0
as n i те pointwise on Tq.
Remark6.2 Note that if 1 < p < p < те and f e Lpoc(Tq; X) is Sp-almost 
automorphic, then f is Sp-almost automorphic. Also if f e AAq (X), then f is 
Sp-almost automorphic for any 1 < p < те.
Remark 6.3 Note that f e AAu( X) if and only if fb e AAq(Lте (1 ,L; X)) .Hence, 
AAu(X) can be regarded as AS^°(X).
Theorem 6.6 We have the following equivalent statements:
(i) f e ASqp(X).
(ii) fb e AAqu(Lp(1,L; X)).
(iii) For each sequence (sn) c Tq there exists a subsequence (sn) such that
g(t) := lim f(t • sn) 
(6.4)
n ^те
exists in the space Llpoc (Tq ; X) and
f(t) = nlim g(t • s-) 
(6.5)
in the sense of Llpoc(Tq , X).

Proof (ii) ^ (i): trivial.
(iii) ^ (ii): Now we prove that
lim fb(t • sn, t) = gb(t, t)
n ^TO
in C(Tq; Lp(1,L; X)). In fact,

Similarly, we have
nlimTO g(t • s—1, t) = fb(t, t)
in C(Tq; Lp(1,L; X)).
(i) ^ (iii): Let fb(t • sn, t) ^ y(t, t) pointwise, where y is a measurable 
function with values in LL( 1, L; X)). By Remark 6.1, y(t, t) = gb(t, t), here gb e 
Llpoc(1,L;X). Let
h
Pn := 
II f(t • Sn) g g(t) IILdqt.

We will prove that pn ^ 0. Indeed, assume that n(h-1) and n(h) are the positive 
integers such that qn(h ) = h-1 and qn(h) = h, then we have

which implies (6.4).
Similarly, we can obtain (6.5). The proof is completed.

Theorem 6.7 ASqp(X) is a closed linear subspace of BSqp(X).
Proof First, we prove that ASqp (X) is closed linear subspaces of BSqp (X). Now 
let f1, f2 e ASqp(X), then by Definition 6.6, f1b, f2b e AAq(Lp(1, L; X)), so by 
Definition 6.6 and Theorem 6.6, we have f1b ,f2b e AAq (X).
By the Minkowski’s Lemma, we have

Hence we have f1 + f2 € ASqp (X).
Moreover, it is clear that f1 e ASq (X) for any scalar A.
Finally, by employing again Minkowski’s Lemma, we can prove that if (fn) is a 
sequence in ASqP (X) that converges to f in SP -norm, then f e ASqP (X). The proof 
is completed. 
□
The following theorem is immediate.
Theorem 6.8 Let f e ASqP(X) and A e L(X), the Banach algebra of all bounded 
linear operators X — X. Then A f e ASq (X).
Now we have the following composition theorem.
Theorem 6.9 Let F : Tq x X — X be a Sp-almost automorphic. Suppose that 
F(t, x) is Lipschitzian in x e X uniformly in t e Tq, i.e., there exists L>0 such 
that
||F(t,u) - F(t,v) || < L||u - v ||
for all t e Tq, (u, v) e X x X.
If ф e ASq(X), then Y : Tq — X defined by Y(•) := F(•, ф(•)) belongs to 
ASqP(X).
Proof Since ф e ASq (X), then for every sequence (sn), there exist a subsequence

Since F : Tq x X ^ X, (t, u) ^ F(t, u) is Sp-almost automorphic in t e Tq 
uniformly in u e X, for every sequence (on), there exist a subsequence (on) and a 
function G(•, u) e Lp(Tq; X) such that

as n ^ те.
Similar to the above, by employing Minkowski’s inequality and both (6.7) 
and (6.9), we can also obtain
( ||G(t • sn 1 • s,^(t • sn 1 • s)) — F(t • s^(t • s))||pdq^ ^ 0

6.3 Weak Almost Automorphy on a Quantum Time Scale
In this section, we will introduce the concept of weakly almost automorphic 
functions (in short w.a.a) on a quantum time scale.
Definition 6.9 A weakly continuous function f : Tq ^ X is weakly almost 
automorphic if for each sequence (sn) c Tq, there exists a subsequence (sn) such 
that
g(t) := weak — lim f (t • sn) 
n ^ж
is well defined for each t e Tq, and
weak — lim g(t — sn) = f(t) 
n ^ж
for each t e Tq .
Also, Definition 6.9 has the following equivalent form.
Definition 6.10 f is weakly almost automorphic, if for every и e X* (dual 
space) the numerical function {v, f} is almost automorphic. f is weakly Sp-almost 
automorphic, if {v, f} e AS^ Vv e X*.
For convenience, we denote the collection of all weakly almost automorphic 
functions by W AAq (X) and the collection of all weakly Sp-almost automorphic 
functions by W ASqp (X).
The following relations are immediate:
AAq(X) c WAAq (X),
AAqu(X) c WAAqu(X),
ASqp(X) c WASqp(X).
Theorem 6.10
(i) Assume that f e W AAq (X). Then f is bounded and its range is separable. As 
a consequence, f e Lж(Tq, X).
(ii) Iff e WASqp(X), then f e BSqp(X).
Proof
(i) By contradiction. Suppose that supteTq || f(t) || = ж, then there exists a 
sequence (sn) c Tq such that limn^ж || f (sn) || = ж. Because f is weakly

almost periodic, one can extract a subsequence (sn) such that
weak - lim f(sn) = a exists. 
n ^TO
Then (f (sn)) is a weakly convergent sequence, and thus it is weakly bounded 
and therefore bounded; this is a contradiction. From (i), we can obtain (ii) 
immediately. 
□
Theorem 6.11 Let X0 c X1 be a continuous and dense embedding of Banach 
spaces.
(i) If f e LTO (Tq, X0) is a weakly continuous function and f e WAAq( X1) (resp. 
f e WAAu(Xi)), then f e WAAq(Xo) (resp., f e WAAu(Xo)).
(ii) Iff e BSqp(X0) andf e WASqp(X1), then f e WASqp(X0).
Proof
(i) The dual embedding X* c X0 is dense and continuous. Therefore, for each 
v e X0 there exists a sequence vn e X* such that limn^TO vn = v in X*. Since
Кv, f(t)) - {vn, f(t) )l < IIf IILTO (Tq ;Xo ) II v - vn llx*,
and all functions (vn, f} are almost automorphic, the desired result follows.
(ii) The proof of (ii) is similar to that of (i).

6.4 Shift-Semigroup Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
In this section, we will generalize the results of the above sections in the matched 
spaces of time scales.
Let (T, In*, F, 3) be a matched space for T and we introduce the notations П- = 
{т e П* : т < e}, П* = {т e П* : т > e} and П* = П* U П*U {e}, 
,+ 
- 
+ 
,
where e is the identity element in П*. For any т e П*, denote 3т(т) := 3(т, т), 
3т2 (т) := 8(т, 3(т, т)),....
Now, we denote by Tт = {3(т, t) : t e T} and Tт 1 = {3(т-1, t) : t e T} for 
т e П*. Then if т e П*\{1}, then if T = Tт U Tт 1, i.e., T coincides exactly with 
Tт, we say T is invariant with respect to the operation 3.
Let X be a Banach space and Тт : X ^ X be a transformation for т e П*. 
Obviously, {T- : т e П*} is a set with a single parameter. Then the multiplication 
is defined as follows:
Tr 1 Tr2 = T3(r 1 ,т2), 
(6.10)

6.4 Shift-Semigroup Under Matched Spaces of Time Scales
333
which yields that
TT1 (TT2 TT3) = TT1 T(T2,T3) = TS(t1 ,S(t2,T3)) = Tl(S(t1 ,T2),T3)) = (TT1 TT2) TT3 ,
I = Te is the identity, and TT-1 is the inverse element of TT. By these definitions 
and notations, the following theorem is immediate.
Theorem 6.12 {TT : t e П*} forms an Abelian operator group with respect to the 
multiplication defined by (6.10).
According to Theorem 6.12, we will introduce some basic concepts to define a 
shift-semigroup for an invariant time scale.
Definition 6.11 Let T be an invariant time scale and {TT} be a collection of 
bounded linear operators on Banach space X. If for all t 1, t2 e П+ the following 
holds:
T(T 1 ,T2) = TT 1 TT2 , 
(6.11)
then {TT : t e П+} is called a single-parameter operator shift-semigroup; if (6.11) 
holds for all t e П*, we call {TT : t e П*} a single-parameter operator shift- 
group.
Definition 6.12 Let T be an invariant time scale and {TT : t e П+} be an operator 
group on a Banach space X, i.e.,
TT1 TT2 = TS(T 1 ,T2), 
T 1, t2 e П+, 
Te = I,
then {TT : t e П+} is said to be the strong-continuous operator shift-semigroup.
Theorem 6.13 Let T be an invariant time scale and {TT : t e П+} be an operator 
semigroup on the Banach space X, and for any x e X and any e > 0 there exists a 
neighborhood U = (t 1 - 00, t 1 + 00) А П+ for some 00 > 0, such that
II Ts(an(T1 ),T-1)|x - x 11^ e for all t2 e U, 
(6.12)
then {TT : t e П+} is a shift-semigroup.
Proof For any L e П+ we claim that
sup{||Tt || : t e [e, L]n*} < +^. 
(6.13)
In fact, for any x e X, we take h e П+, c > 0 such that
sup{||TtxII : T e [e, h]n*} < c.

334
6 C0-Semigroup and Stepanov-Like Almost Automorphic Functions on Hybrid. . .
Now for т e [e, L]n*, let т = S(Shk-1 (h), r), r e П*, where k < S(L, h 1), 0 < 
r<h.Then, it follows that
II 11 = 11 TShk-i (hT II <11 TShk-i h IIc.
Hence (6.13) holds. In what follows we let M := sup{||Тт || : т e [e, L]n*}.
For any e > 0, there is S0, such that for т2 e (т 1 - S0, т 1 + S0)n+, we have:
(i) If т2 > т 1, then ап(т 1) = т 1, and we have
IIТт2 x Тт 1 x II < II Ton(r 1 )(Ts (т2 ,a/-1 (т 1)) I)x + Тт 1 (TS (ап(т1 ),т -1) I)x H < 2 Me.
In the above ап(т 1) = т 1. In fact, if ап(т 1) > т 1, then т 1 is a right scattered 
point, which implies that т2 = т1, and this contradicts т2 >т1 .
(ii) If т2 < т 1, then т2 < т 1 < ап(т 1), which yields e < 8(ап(т 1 ),т-1) < 
S(^П(т 1), т—1). Hence, we have
||T2x — Тт 1 x || < ||T2 (I — TS(ап(т 1 ),т—1 ))x + Тт1 (T(ап(т1 ),т —1) — I)x II < 2Me.
Hence, for т2 e (т 1 - 8, т 1 + 8)п+, the following holds:
II Тт2x - Тт1 x II < 2Me.
Hence, {Тт : т e П+} is a shift-semigroup and (6.12) holds. This completes the 
proof. 
□
In the following, the definition of infinitesimal generator of a shift-semigroup 
will be introduced.
Definition 6.13 Let T be an invariant time scale and {Тт : т e П+} be a shift­
semigroup on a Banach space X.LetD denote a subset ofX, which has the property 
that for each x e D there exists a y e X such that for any e>0, there is a 
neighborhood U = (т 1 - S 0, т 1 + S 0)n+ for some S 0 > 0, which satisfy
II(T\s(ап(т1 ),т-^1)|- I)x - У।°п(т 1) - т2||| <e|ап(т 1) - т21, 
т2 e U. 
(6.14)
For т 1 ^ e, we define A : D ^ X satisfying Ax = y, where y is fixed by (6.14). 
In what follows we call this A the infinitesimal generator of this shift-semigroup.

which implies that Definition 6.13 is equivalent to Definition 6.3 when T = qZ.
Theorem 6.14 Let T be an invariant time scale, {Тт : т e П+} be a shift­
semigroup on Banach space X satisfying (6.12), andA be the infinitesimal generator 
of the shift-semigroup. Then A is a closed densely defined operator and for every 
x e D (A), the following holds:
(Ттх)Лп = А(Ттх) = TAx,
(6.15)
that is,
(Ттх) — x = f ATsxAns = f TsAxAns,
(6.16)
where D(A) denotes the domain of the operator A and An is the differential 
operator over the time scale П.
Proof First we show that A is a densely defined operator. Note that for any x e X, 
we have

Next, we will show that (6.15) and (6.16) hold. Since

and so, TT 1 x e D(A). From (6.18), we also have
II(T\s(an(T1 ),T--1)\ - I)x - \an(T 1) - T2\Ax|| < e\ап(т 1) - t2\. 
(6.19) 
(i) If т2 > т 1, then from (6.19) and Theorem 6.13 it follows that

where M := sup{||TT || : т e [e, L]n*} and L e П* is any fixed positive 
constant. In the above it is necessary to note that ап(т 1) = т 1, since if 
ап(т 1) > т 1, then т 1 is right scattered point, which implies that т2 = т 1, 
and this contradicts our assumption that T2 >T1 .
(ii) If т2 < т 1, then it follows from т2 < т 1 < ап(т 1) that 0 < т 1 - т2 <
ап(т 1) - т2. Hence, from (6.19) and Theorem 6.13, we obtain

where M := sup{||TT|| : т e [0, L]n*}, and L e П* is any fixed positive 
constant.
Therefore, (TTx')&n = TTAx = ATTx. Since (6.16) is the integral form 
of (6.15), we can conclude that (6.16) holds.
Finally, we show that A is a closed operator. Let xn e D(A), xn ^ x, Axn ^ 
y, then by (6.19), we have
II (TIS (vn(T 1 ),t-) | - I)x - I °n(T 1) - T2I y ||

Hence, x e D(A) and Ax = y, that is, A is a closed operator. This completes the 
proof.

semigroup, and D(A) = X, eA(8(т 1, т2), e) = еА(т 1, е)еА(т2, e) for all т 1, т2 e 
П+. Then,
Тт = ел(т, e), т e П+,
where D(A) denotes the domain of A.
Proof From Theorem 6.14, we have
(еА(т, e)x)An = АеА(т, e)x = еА(т, e)Ax.
Further, since eA (т, e) is A-differentiable on П, for any e > 0, there is a 8 > 0 such 
that for т2 e (т 1 - 8, т 1 + 8)П*, it follows that
II(eAon^ 1), e) - eA^2, e))x - (<?п(т 1) - т2)AeA(r 1, e)x|| < e|оп(т 1) - т2|,
(6.20) 
and hence:
(i) If т2 >т1, then it follows from (6.20) that
IIeA^n^ 1), e)[I - eA(8(т2, о-(т 1)), e)x

In the above оП(т 1) = т 1. Indeed, if оП(т 1) > т 1, then т 1 is a right scattered 
point, and then т2 = т1, which is a contradiction since т2 >т1.
(ii) If т2 < т 1, then it follows from т2 < т 1 < оП(т 1) that 0 < т 1 - т2 <
оп(т 1) - т2. Hence, from (6.20) we can obtain
IIeA(т2, e)[^(^(т 1) - т2, e) - I)x - (оп(т 1) - т2)Ax

where M := sup{||eA^, e)|| : т :e [e, L]n*}, and L e П* is any fixed positive

From (i), (ii), we obtain

||(eA (j8(ап(т 1), т2 1)|, ej - ij x - |ап(т 1) - т2| Ax || < 2Me|ап(т 1) - т2|.
Therefore, A is the infinitesimal generator of {Тт : т e П+}. This completes the 
proof. 
□
Remark 6.6 Notice that if T = qZ, then
Тт = еА(т, 1) = П [i + (q -1A].
Definition 6.14 Let A be the infinitesimal generator of the shift-semigroup. We call 
eA(t, 10), 10 e T the exponential function generated by A on the time scale T. We 
also let Tt = eA(t,t0) and call Tt the moving operator on T.
Let X be a Banach space and consider the following system:
xA = Ax(t), x(t0) = x0, 10 e T, 
(6.21)
where A is the infinitesimal generator of a shift-semigroup satisfying all the 
conditions in Theorem 6.15, and x : T ^ X.
Theorem 6.16 The fundamental solution of the system (6.21) can be expressed as
x(t) = Ttx0 .
Proof From Definition 6.14, Tt = eA(t, 10), and hence
xA = (Ttx 0 )A = ATtx(t0) = Ax(t).
Hence, Ttx0 is the fundamental solution of (6.21). This completes the proof. □
From Theorem 6.16, the following result follows immediately.
Theorem 6.17 Let A be the infinitesimal generator of the shift-semigroup, and let 
Tt be the moving operator on T. Then

6.5 Stepanov-Like Almost Automorphic Functions in 
Matched Spaces of Time Scales
In this section, we will introduce the concept of Stepanov-like almost automorphic 
functions under matched spaces of time scales and provide some basic properties.
Definition 6.15 (see [188, 204]) A function f e C(T, X), where X is a Banach 
space, is said to be almost automorphic (a.a. for short) in Bochner’s sense if for 
every sequence of (sn) с П*, there exists a subsequence (sn) such that
g(t) := lim f (8(sn,t)) 
n ^TO
is well defined for each t e T, and
nlim g (3(s-1 ,t)) =f(t)
for each t e T.
If the convergence above is uniform in t e T, then f is almost periodic in 
the Bochner’s sense. We denote by AAS(X) the collection of all (Bochner) almost 
automorphic functions T ^ X. Similar to the proof process in the literature [67], 
the following theorem is immediate by replacing the operation + by the operation 
3.
Theorem 6.18 If f, f1 ,f2 e AAS(X), then:
(i) f1 + f2 e AA3(X).
(ii) f e AAS(X) for any scalar k.
(iii) fa e AAS(X) where fa : T ^ X is defined by fa(•) = f(3(a, •)).
(iv) The range Rf := f(t) : t e T is relatively compact inX; thus f is bounded 
in norm.
(v) If fn ^ f uniformly on T, where fn e AAS(X), then f e AAS(X).
AAS(X) equipped with the sup-norm || f ||AAs(X) = supteT || f (t)|| turns out to 
be a Banach space. Now we denote by AA3u(X) the closed subspace of all functions 
f e AA3(X) with g e C(T, X). Equivalently, f e AA3u(X) if and only if f is 
almost automorphic and all convergence in Definition 6.15 are uniform on compact 
intervals. Obviously, we have
APS(X) c AAU(X) с AA&(X) C BC(X),
where BC(X) stands for the Banach space of bounded and continuous functions 
with values in X.
Definition 6.16 The Bochner transform fb(t, s),t e T, s e [ e, L ] n *, of a function 
f (t) on T, with values in X, is defined by f b(t, s) = f (3(s, t)).

6.5 Stepanov-Like Almost Automorphic Functions in Matched Spaces of Time. . .
341
Remark 6.7 A function p(t, s), t e T, s e [e, L]n*, is the Bochner transform of a 
certain function f(t), that is,
<p(t,s) = fb(t,s),
if and only if
V(8(T,t),8(s,T 1)) = v(s, t)
for all t e T, s e [e, L]n* and т e [8(s, L 1), s]n*. In fact,
р(8(т, t), 8(s, т-1)) = f (8(8(s, т-1), 8(т, t))) 
= f (8(s, 8(т-1,8(T,t)))) 
= f (8(s,t)) = V(t,s).
Definition 6.17 Let p e [1, те). The space BSp(X) of Stepanov bounded func­
tions, with the exponent p, consists of all measurable functions f on T with values 
in X such that fb e Lте(T, Lp(e, L; X)). This is a Banach space with the norm

of all f e BS8p(X) such that fb e AA8(Lp(e, L; X)).
Definition 6.18 also has the following equivalent form.
Definition 6.19 A function f e Llpoc (T; X) is said to be S p -almost automorphic if 
its Bochner transform fb : T ^ Lp(e, L; X) is almost automorphic in the sense 
that for every sequence of numbers (sn) с П*, there exist a subsequence (sn) and a 
function g e Llpoc (T, X) such that

Theorem 6.20 ASP (X) is a closed linear subspace of BSP (X).
Proof First, we prove that ASP (X) is closed linear subspaces of BSP (X). Now let 
f1, f2 e ASg(X), then by Definition 6.17, f1b, f2 e AAs(LP(e, L; X)), so by 
Definition 6.17 and Theorem 6.19, we have f1b, f2 e AAS(X).

Finally, by employing again Minkowski’s Lemma, we can prove that if (fn) is a

Theorem 6.21 Let f e ASp (X) and A e L(X), the Banach algebra of all

Now we have the following composition theorem.
Theorem 6.22 Let F : T x X ^ X be a Sp -almost automorphic. Suppose that 
F(t, x) is Lipschitzian in x e X uniformly in t e T, i.e., there exists L>0 such

Since F : T x X ^ X, (t, u) ^ F(t, u) is Sp-almost automorphic in t e T

Chapter 7
Almost Periodic Dynamic Equations
Under Matched Spaces
In this chapter, based on the theory of S-almost periodic functions and n0-order A - 
almost periodic functions developed in Chap. 4, some fundamental results of the 
S-almost periodic solutions and n0-order A-almost periodic solutions of a general 
dynamic equations are established under matched spaces of time scales. Particularly, 
the basic results of almost periodic problems of the q-dynamic equations on a 
quantum time scale are included as the special case. In Sects. 7.1-7.3, by using the 
developed theory of matched spaces of time scales, the basic theory of dynamic 
equations under matched space of time scales is established and some effective 
methods are provided to study the almost periodic solutions of dynamic equations 
on hybrid time scales.
7.1 Basic Theory of Nonlinear Almost Periodic Dynamic 
Equations
Almost periodic problems and the generalized problems of the dynamic equations 
have attracted many mathematicians and there are many works related to this topic 
(see Agarwal et al. [14, 15, 18], Andres et al. [40], Baillon et al. [49], Baroun et 
al. [50], Bugajewski et al. [68], Dads et al. [82, 83], Diagana et al. [89, 90, 92, 93, 
96-99, 102], Hernandez et al. [121-123], Ji et al. [127], Pinto et al. [154], Zhang 
[216-218]). With the rapid development of this field, the almost periodic functions 
have been introduced on time scales and some interesting problems of discrete and 
continuous dynamic equations and more complex and distinct dynamical behavior 
were proposed and studied on hybrid domains (see Wang et al. [171, 180, 186, 189, 
190, 192, 193, 195, 198, 201]).

7 Almost Periodic Dynamic Equations Under Matched Spaces
In this section, we introduce some new concepts related to dynamic equations 
under the matched spaces of time scales and we establish some basic results on 
almost periodic dynamic equations.
We consider the following nonlinear dynamic system:
xA = f(t,x), 
(7.1)
where f (t, x) e C(T x En, En), and let Q = {x(t) : x(t) be a bounded solution to 
(7.1)}.
Definition 7.1 Assume that Q =0 and X = inf ||x || exists, then X is said to be the 
xeQ
least value of solutions for (7.1). If there exists y(t) e Q such that ||y|| = X, then 
<p(t) is said to be a minimum norm solution to (7.1), where || • || = supteT | • |.
Following the proof of Theorem 5.1 in [72], one can easily get the following.
Lemma 7.1 Assume that f e C(T x S, En) is bounded on T* x S and (7.1) has 
a bounded solution y(t) such that {y(t), t e T} c S, and moreover, 0 e S. Then 
there is a minimum norm solution for (7.1).
Lemma 7.2 Assume that f(t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e En 
under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8'), S = {y(t) : t > 10} and (7.1) has a 
bounded solution y(t) on [10, to)T, then (7.1) has a 8-almostperiodic solution ^(t) 
fulfilling {^(t), t e T} c S.
Proof First, we choose a = {ak} c fl such that lim ak = +to and 
к ^+to
T8, f(t,x) = lim f (8 , (t),x) = f(t,x) 
a 
к^TO ' ak 
'
holds uniformly on T* x S. Let ^k(t) = y(8a/ (t)).
Next, for Va e T*, we will prove that for sufficiently large к, {ук} is defined on 
(a, to)t and is a solution for xA = f(t, x). Because y(t) is a solution to (7.1), we 
have T8(<pA(t)) = T8(f(t,x)), i.e.,
lim (cp(8'(t)))A = ( lim (ip(8 / (t))))A = lim (f (8, (t),x) = f(t,x).
к^to ' ak 
к к— ‘TO 'p то: 
к^TO a ak '
Obviously, {ук(1)} is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous on (a, to)T. Let a 
be a sequence which goes to +TO, and by Corollary 3.4 from [179], there exist 
a = {a^} c a such that T^^t) = lim y(8a> (t) = ^(t) holds uniformly on 
T*. Therefore, we get ^(t) e S, Vt e T*. Moreover, it follows from T^ f (t, x) = 
lim f (8 i (t), x) = f(t,x) that ^(t) is a 8-almost periodic solution for (7.1).

This completes the proof.

Lemma 7.3 Assume that f(t,x) e C(T x En, En) is 8-almost periodic in t 
uniformly for x e En under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8). If (7.1) has a 
minimum norm solution, then for any g e H8(f), the following equation
xA = g(t, x) 
(7.2)
has the same least value of solutions as that of (7.1).
Proof First, let y(t) be the minimum norm solution for (7.1) and X be the least 
value. Because g e H8(f), there is a sequence a e fl such that Ts, f(t,x) = 
g(t, x) holds uniformly on T* x S. According to Corollary 3.4 from [179], there 
exists a c a such that T^yf) = f(t) holds uniformly on T*. Therefore, f(t) is 
a solution for (7.2). Moreover, it follows from |y(t)| < X that | f(t) | < X. Hence, 
X' = || f || < X. In view of y(t) = Г8_1 f(t) and | f(t)| < X', one obtains |y(t)| < 
X . Therefore, X = || y || < X , i.e., X = X . The proof is completed. 
□
Following the proof of Lemma 7.3, the following lemma is immediate.
Lemma 7.4 Assume that y(t) is a minimum norm solution for (7.1) and there is 
a sequence a c fl such that T8 f(t, x) = g(t, x) exists uniformly on T* x S. 
Moreover, if there exists a subsequence a c a such that T^yf) = f(t) holds 
uniformly on T*, then f(t) is a minimum norm solution to (7.2).
Lemma 7.5 Assume that f e C(T x En, En) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly 
for x e En. Moreover, for every g e H8 (f), (7.2) has a unique minimum norm 
solution. Then these minimum norm solutions are 8-almost periodic on T*.
Proof For any given g e H8 (f), there is a unique minimum norm solution f(t) 
for (7.2). Because g(t, x) is 8-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e En , for any 
sequences a , в С П, there exist common subsequences a c a , в С в such that
T8a,e)g(t,x) = T8T8g(t,x)
holds uniformly on T* x S and T^Tpff), T^ap)f(t) exist uniformly on T*. 
According to Lemmas 7.3 and 7.4, it follows that T^Tpff) and T^ap)f(t) are 
minimum norm solutions for the following equation:
? = T8a,e)g(t,x).
Thus, we have T;8 Tpf(t) = T-^ p)f(t) because the uniqueness of the minimum 
norm solution. Therefore, f(t) is a -almost periodic solution. The proof is 
completed.

Now, consider the linear S-almost periodic dynamic equation on T
xA = A(t)x + f(t) 
(7.3)
and its associated homogeneous equation
xA = A(t)x, 
(7.4)
where A(t) is a S-almost periodic matrix function and f(t) is a S-almost periodic 
vector function.
Definition 7.2 Assume that B e HS(A); the dynamic equation
yA = B(t)y 
(7.5)
is said to be a homogeneous equation in the hull of (7.3).
Definition 7.3 Assume that B e HS (A) and g e HS (f); the dynamic equation
yA = B(t)y + g(t) 
(7.6)
is said to be an equation in the hull of (7.3).
We introduce the following exponential dichotomy which will be used later.
Definition 7.4 Let A(t) be an n x n rd-continuous matrix function on T. The linear 
system
xA(t) = A(t)x(t) 
(7.7)
is said to admit an exponential dichotomy on T if there exist positive constants K, a, 
projection P and the fundamental solution matrix X(t) of (7.7), fulfilling
|X(t)PX-1 (s)| < Keea (t, p(s)), s,t e T,t > s, 
(78)
|X(t)(I - P)X-1 (s)| < Keea(s, p(t)), s,t e T,t < s.

In the following, we will establish Favard’s theorem for homogeneous linear 
dynamic equation.
Lemma 7.6 Assume that A(t) is a S-almost periodic matrix function and x(t) is a 
S -almost periodic solution of the homogeneous linear dynamic equation
xA = A(t)x.

Proof If inf |x(t) | = 0, there exists {tn} c T such that |x(tn)| ^ 0 as n ^ ж, and

implies |x (3a(tn)) - x(tn) | < -. Furthermore, since x(t) is 3-almost periodic on 
T, it is uniformly continuous on T; we take t0 e T, then 110 - tn | < 3* implies 
143^n (t0» — x^ (tn) I < -. Therefore, for sufficiently large n e N, we have 
|x(3a'(t0))— x(tn)\ < |x(3a/ (tо))-x(3a/ (tn))| + |x(3a/ (tn))-x(tn)\ < - + - <e.

Hence, according to Theorem 2.77 from [61], it follows that y(t) = y(t0)eB(t,t0) =

If (7.3) has bounded solution on [t0, rc>)T, then (7.3) has a 8-almost periodic

solution to (7.3) on T* and for every pair of T„A(t) = B(t) and Tf(t) = g(t), 
(7.6) has a minimum norm solution.
Next, we will show that the minimum norm solution to (7.6) is unique.
For a fixed pair of B(t) and g(t), we consider (7.6). Let (7.6) have two different 
minimum norm solutions x 1 (t) and x2 (t), and their least values are equal to A. Since 
12 x 1 (t) - x2(t) is a bounded non-trivial solution to (7.5), from the condition of the 
lemma, there exists a real number p > 0 such that
inf-1x 1 (t) — x2(t)I > p > 0.

so 2 (x 1 (t) + x2(t) is a solution to (7.6), and thus
2 (x 1 (t) + x2 (t)) < д/л2
This is a contradiction. The proof is completed.
Lemma 7.8 Assume that every bounded solution of a homogeneous equation in the 
hull of (7.3) is 8-almost periodic, then all bounded solutions of (7.3) are 8-almost 
periodic.
Proof It follows from Lemma 7.6 that every non-trivial bounded solution for 
equations in the hull of (7.3) fulfills inf |x(t)| > 0. According to Lemma 7.7, we 
tST
have that if (7.3) has bounded solutions on T, then (7.3) has a 8-almost periodic 
solution ^(t). Assume ^(t) is an arbitrary bounded solution of (7.3), then n(t) =
Now by the parallelogram law, we have

f(t) - y(t) is a 3-almost periodic solution of its associated homogeneous equation 
(7.4). Therefore, y(t) is a S-almost periodic solution. This completes the proof. □
Lemma 7.9 Assume that a homogeneous equation in the hull of (7.3) has a unique 
bounded solution x(t) = 0, then (7.3) has a unique S-almost periodic solution.
Proof If f(t), <p(t) are two bounded solutions to (7.3), then x(t) = y(t) — f(t) is 
a solution of a homogeneous equation in the hull of (7.3). It follows from x(t) = 0 
that <p(t) = f(t). According to Lemma 7.8, (7.3) has a unique S-almost periodic 
solution. This completes the proof. 
□
Using a proof similar to that in Lemmas 7.4-7.5 in [108], one can easily prove 
Lemmas 7.10-7.11 (we omit their proof).
Lemma 7.10 If P is a projection and X is a Л-differentiable invertible matrix such 
that XP X-1 is bounded on T, then there exists a differentiable matrix S such that 
XPX—1 = SPS—1 for all t e T and S, S—1 are bounded on T. Moreover, there is 
an S of the form S = XQ-1 and Q commutes with P.
Lemma 7.11 Assume that (7.4) admits an exponential dichotomy and X(t) is the 
fundamental solution matrix for (7.4) and C non-singular. Then X(t)C admits an 
exponential dichotomy with the same projection P if and only ifCP = PC.
Lemma 7.12 Suppose that A(t) is a S-almost periodic matrix function under the 
matched spaces (T, F, I n *, S) and (7.4) admits an exponential dichotomy. Then for 
every B e HS(A) (7.5) admits an exponential dichotomy with the same projection 
P and the same constants K, a.
Proof In view of Lemma 7.10, where X is the fundamental solution matrix 
satisfying (7.8), let Q and S be given as in Lemma 7.10. Let TaSA = B uniformly 
on T*. For any given t0 e T*, let Xn(t) = X(8an(t))Q—1(8an(t0)), from (7.4), we 
obtain
(X(t)) Л = A(t)X(t), 
(7.9)
and replacing t with San(t) in (7.9), we obtain
(X (San(t) )) Л = A ( San(t) ) X ( San(t) ),
i.e., X£(f) = ASan(t)Xn(t), so Xn(t) is a fundamental solution matrix to 
хЛ = A{8an (t))x, by Lemma 7.11, it has an exponential dichotomy with the same 
projection P and the same constants. This is true since Q-1 commutes with P. 
We may take subsequences so that Xn(t0) and Xn-1 (t0) converge since they are 
S San (t0) and S-1 San (t0) and these are bounded. Without changing notation we 
may assume that Xn(t0) ^ Y0, then X—1 (t0) ^ Z0 where Z0 = Y— 1. But now for 
a suitable subsequence Xn(t) converges to a solution of уЛ = By uniformly on T.

Denote this solution by Y. Then Y (t0) = Y0 is non-singular and clearly Y satisfies 
(7.8) since Xn does for all n. The proof is completed.

Lemma 7.13 Assume that the homogeneous equation (7.4) admits an exponential 
dichotomy, then (7.4) has only one bounded solution x(t) = 0.
Proof Assume X(t) is the fundamental solution matrix for (7.4). For any sequence 
а с П, we use the notations An = A(8an(t)}, Xn(t) = XSan(t). For the 
homogeneous equation (7.4) has an exponential dichotomy, it follows that there 
is a constant M such that ||Xn(t)|| < M and ||XA(t)|| = ||An(t)Xn(t)|| < AM,

is {ank} := а с a suchthat {Xnk} converges uniformly on T* and lim X(3an(t>)

exists uniformly on T*. Hence, we find that X(t) is S-almost periodic. Moreover, 
because the homogeneous equation (7.4) has an exponential dichotomy, it follows 
that inftsT x(t) = 0. By Lemma 7.6, we have x(t) = 0. This completes the proof.

Lemma 7.14 Assume that the homogeneous equation (7.4) admits an exponential 
dichotomy, then all equations in the hull of (7.4) have only one bounded solution 
x(t) = 0.
Proof According to Lemma 7.12, all equations in the hull of (7.4) have an 
exponential dichotomy; it follows from Lemma 7.13 that all equations in the hull 
of (7.4) have only one bounded solution x(t) = 0. This completes the proof. □
Theorem 7.1 Let A(t) be a S-almost periodic matrix function and f(t) be a S- 
almost periodic vector function. Moreover, if (7.4) admits an exponential dichotomy, 
then (7.3) has a unique S-almost periodic solution

7.4 n0-Order A-Almost Periodic Solutions for Dynamic 
Equations
In this section, we introduce some new concepts related to dynamic equations under 
matched spaces for time scales and we establish some results on almost periodic 
dynamic equations.
Consider the following nonlinear dynamic equation:
xA = Sfn0(t, x), 
(7.13)
where f(t, x) e C(TxEn, En), Sf0 (t, x) = f(t, x)(&An* (t))n0, and let Q = {x(t) : 
x(t) be a bounded solution to (7.13)}.
Definition 7.5 If (7.13) has a solution Sxn0 (t), i.e, (Sxn0)A(t) = Sf (t, Sxn0), then we 
say Sxn0 is a solution with an affiliated function x.
Definition 7.6 If Q = 0, then A = inf ||x || exists, and A is called the least value of 
xeQ
solutions for (7.13). If there exists gt)t) e Q such that ||y || = A, then (t))i is called 
a minimum norm solution to (7.13), where || • || = supteT | • |.
Let F(t,x) = f(t,x) (&An* (t))n0 and follow the proof of Theorem 5.1 in [72], 
and one can easily get the following.
Lemma 7.15 If f e C(T x S, En) is bounded on T* x S and (7.13) has a bounded 
solution y(t) such that {^(t), t e T} c S and 0 e S, then there must be a minimum 
norm solution for (7.13).
Lemma 7.16 Let f(t, x) be A8n0 -almost periodic in t uniformly for x e En with 
the ASS-function Sf0 = f (t, x) (8An* (t))n0 under the matched space (T, F, In*, 8), 
S = {Snp0 (t) : t > 10} and (7.13) has a bounded solution Sp0 (t) on [10, to)T, where 
SP0 (t) = y(t) (&An* (t))n0. Then (7.13) has a 8-almostperiodic solution Sf0 (t) with 
the An 0-almost periodic affiliated function ^(t) satisfying {Sf0 (t), t e T} c S.
Proof In fact, we may take a = {ak} c fl such that lim ak = +to and 
k ^+to

holds uniformly on T* x S. For any fixed a e T*, consider the interval (a, to)t and 
^k(t) = (p(8a(t))(8a (t))n0.
Next, we will prove that for k sufficiently large, {?k} is defined on (a, TO)T and 
is a solution to xA = f(t, x). Since p(t) is a solution to (7.13) it follows that 
TAn0 (p(t)(8An* (t))n0)A = T8n0 (f(t, Sp0)(8en* (t))n0), i.e.,

It is easy to see that {fk(t)} is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous on (a, rc>)T. 
Then let a be a sequence which goes to +^; according to Corollary 3.4 from [179], 
there must exist a = {ak} c a such that

thus, for all t e T*, we have Sf0 (t) e S. Since

Sf0(t) is a 8-almost periodic solution to (7.13) and f(t) is Asn0-almost periodic.

Lemma 7.17 Let f e C(T x En, En) be A&
n0-almost periodic in t uniformly for 
x e En with the ASS-function Sfn0 = f(t,x) 8e? *(t) n0 under the matched space 
(T, F, In*, 8). If (7.13) has a minimum norm solution, then for any Sf,0 (t, x) e 
Hn0 (Sfn0 ), the following equation
x? = Sg(t, x) 
(7.14)
has the same least value of solutions as that of (7.13).
Proof Let v(t)(8?n* (t)n0 be the minimum norm solution to (7.13) and A be the 
least value. Since Sf,0 (t, x) e Hn0 (Sf0), there exists a sequence a e fl such that 
Ts;n0Sf0(t, x) = Sn0 (t, x) holds uniformly on T* x S. From Corollary 3.4 in [179], 
there exists a c a' such that T08’n0Sf>0(t) = Sf.0(t) holds uniformly on T*. Hence, 
Sf0 (t) is a solution to (7.14). For |Sf0 (t) | < к, we have |Sf0 (t) | < A; thus, A' = 
||Sf.01| < A. Since Sf,0(t) = Tf-n0Sf0(t) and |Sf0(t)| < A', we obtain |Sf0(t)| < A', 
and thus, A = || Sf 01| < A'. Therefore, A = A'. The proof is completed. 
□
Following the proof in Lemma 7.17, the following lemma is immediate.

7.4 no-Order A-Almost Periodic Solutions for Dynamic Equations

Lemma 7.18 Let Sf0 (t) be a minimum norm solution to (7.13), where
snn0 = ?(t) (&An* (t))n 0,
and there exists a sequence a' c fl such that T-f0Sf0(t,x) = Sg0(t,x) exists 
uniformly on T* x S. Furthermore, if there exists a subsequence a c a such 
that T-”0S”0 (t) = Sf0 (t) holds uniformly on T*, then Sf0(t) is a minimum norm 
solution to (7.14).
Lemma 7.19 Let f e C(T x En, En) be A-0-almost periodic in t uniformly for 
x e En with the ASS-function Sf0 = f(t, x) (&An * (t))n 0, and for every Sg0 (t, x) e 
Hn0 (Sf0), (7.14) has a unique minimum norm solution Sf0 (t). Then these minimum 
norm solutions are S-almost periodic solutions with A-0-almost periodic affiliated 
functions.
Proof For a fixed Sgn0 (t, x) e Hn0 (Sfn0), (7.14) has the unique minimum norm 
solution Sf0(t). Since g(t, x) is An0-almost periodic in t uniformly for x e En with 
the ASS-function Sg0 = g(t, x)(-An* (t))n0, we have for any sequences a’, в’ C fl, 
there exist common subsequences a c a , в С в such that

are minimum norm solutions to the following equation:
xA = TSnPS” 0 (t’x).
Since the minimum norm solution is unique, we have T-”0 T-n0 Sf0 (t) = 
T-'(n>p)Sf0(t). Therefore, Sf0(t) is S-almost periodic and f(t) is An0-almost 
periodic. The proof is completed. 
□
We will now discuss the linear An0-almost periodic dynamic equation on T
xA = SAn0(t)x(t) + Sfn0(t) 
(7.15)
and its associated homogeneous equation
xA = SAn0(t)x(t)’ 
(7.16)
where A(t) is an An0-almost periodic matrix function and f (t) is an An0-almost 
periodic vector function.

Definition 7.7 If SB0 e Hn0 (SA0), we say that
yA = SBn0 (t)y(t) 
(7.17)

Definition 7.8 If SBn0 e Hn0 (SAn0 ) and Sgn0 e Hn0 (Sfn0 ), we say that
yA = SB0 (t)y(t) + Snn 0 (t) 
(7.18)
is an equation in the hull of (7.15).
We introduce the following exponential dichotomy which will be used later.
Definition 7.9 Let A(t) be an n x n rd-continuous matrix function on T and X(t) 
be the fundamental matrix solution for the dynamic equation
xA(t) = A(t)x(t). 
(7.19)
Then the linear dynamic equation
xA (t) = SAn0 (t)x(t) 
(7.20)
is said to admit an exponential dichotomy on T if there exist positive constants K, a, 
projection P and the fundamental solution matrix Sxn0 (t) of (7.20), satisfying
|SX0(t)P(SX0)-1 (s)| < Keea(t, P(s), s,t e T,t > s,
|SX0(t)(I - P)(SnX0)-1 (s)I < Keea(s, P(t)), s,t e T,t < s, 
(7.21)
where SX0 = X(t)№n* (t)n0.
In the following, we will establish Favard’s theorem for homogeneous linear 
dynamic equation.
Lemma 7.20 If A(t) is a Asn0-almost periodic matrix function with the ASS­
function SA0 = A(t)(beAn * (t)n 0 and SX0 (t) is a 8-almost periodic solution of the 
homogeneous linear dynamic equation

Lemma 7.21 Suppose that (7.16) has a 8-almostperiodic solution Sx(t) with the 
Ay 0-almost periodic affiliated function x(t) and inft sT | Sx(t) | > 0. If (7.15) has 
bounded solution on [10, те)T, then (7.15) has a 8-almost periodic solution with an 
A8y0 -almost periodic affiliated function.
Proof According to Lemmas 7.15 and 7.16, we know that there is a minimum 
norm solution to (7.15) on T* and for every pair of Ta"0SnA0 (t) = SnB0 (t) and 
T8y0 Sf0 (t) = Sg0 (t), (7.18) has a minimum norm solution.
Next, we will prove that the minimum norm solution to (7.18) is unique.
For a fixed pair of SBy0 (t) and Sgy0 (t), we consider (7.18). Let (7.18) have two 
different minimum norm solutions Sx1 (t) and Sx2 (t), and their least values are equal 
1
to A. Since - S1 (t) — Sx2 (t) is a bounded non-trivial solution to (7.17), from the 
condition of the lemma, there exists a real number p > 0 such that
inf 21 Sx 1 (t) — Sx2 (t)| > p > 0.
Now by the parallelogram law, we have
12 (Sx 1 (t) + Sx2 (t))|2 + 12 (Sx 1 (t) — Sx2 (t))|2 = 1 (|Sx 1 (t) |2 + |Sx2 (t) |2) < A2,
and noting that
(2 ( S (t) + S (t) A = 1 SA + 1 SA
1
then we obtain 2 (Sx 1 (t) + Sx2 (t)] as a solution to (7.18), and thus
\2 Sx 1 (t) + Sx2 (t)

Lemma 7.22 If every bounded solution Sxn0 (t) of a homogeneous equation in the 
hull of (7.15) is 8-almost periodic solution with an A^0-almost periodic affiliated 
function x, then all bounded solutions of (7.15) are 8-almost periodic solutions with 
a A8n0 -almost periodic affiliated functions.
Proof According to Lemma 7.20, we know that every non-trivial bounded solution 
of equations in the hull of (7.15) satisfies inf |Sx0 (t)| > 0. From Lemma 7.21 it 
follows that if (7.15) has bounded solutions on T, then (7.15) has a 8-almost periodic 
solution Sf0 (t). If Sv0 (t) is an arbitrary bounded solution of (7.15), then S"0 (t) = 
Sf0 (t ) — Sn0 (t) is a bounded solution of its associated homogeneous equation (7.16), 
and it is 8-almost periodic. Thus, Sf0 (t) is a 8-almost periodic solution with an An0- 
almost periodic affiliated function <p. This completes the proof. 
□
Lemma 7.23 If a homogeneous equation in the hull of (7.15) has the unique 
bounded solution Sx0 (t) = 0, then (7.15) has a unique 8-almost periodic solution 
with an A8n0-almost periodic affiliated function.
Proof Let Sf0(t), Sf0(t) be two bounded solutions to (7.15), then Sx0(t) = 
Sf0(t) — Sf0(t) is a solution of ahomogeneous equation in the hull of (7.15); since 
Sxn0 (t) = 0, we have that Spn0 (t) = Sfn0 (t). Thus, by Lemma 7.22, (7.15) has a 
unique 8-almost periodic solution. This completes the proof. 
□
A proof similar to that of Lemmas 7.4-7.5 in [108] will give Lemmas 7.24-7.25 
(we omit the proofs).
Lemma 7.24 Let P be a projection and X a differentiable invertible matrix such 
that XP X—1 is bounded on T. Then there exists a differentiable matrix S such that 
XPX—1 = SPS—1 for all t e T and S, S— 1 are bounded on T. In fact, there is an 
S of the form S = XQ—1, where Q commutes with P.
Lemma 7.25 If (7.16) has an exponential dichotomy and X(t) is the fundamental 
solution matrix of (7.16), C non-singular, then X(t)C has an exponential dichotomy 
with the same projection P if and only ifCP = PC.
Lemma 7.26 Suppose that A(t) is a A8n0-almost periodic matrix function with the 
ASS-function SnA0 = A(t)(8eAn* (t)n0 under the matched spaces (T, F, In*, 8) and 
(7.16) has an exponential dichotomy. Then for every SBn0 (t) e Hn0 (SAn0), (7.17) has 
an exponential dichotomy with the same projection P and the same constants K, a.
Proof In view of Lemma 7.24, where Sxn0 is the fundamental solution matrix 
satisfying (7.21), let Q and S be as in Lemma 7.24. Let Ta8,n0SAn0 = SBn0 uniformly

on T*. For any given t0 e T*, let Xn(t) = X(8an(t))(8^n(t))n0 Q 1(8Un(t0)); from 
(7.16), we obtain
(X(t)(8еП* (t))n0)A = A(t)X(t)(8^* (t))n0(8еП* (t))n0; 
(7.22)
replacing t with 8an (t) in (7.22), we obtain

An 0 An 0
(X(8an(t))(8an(t)) 
/ = A8an(t^X(8an(t^(8an(t^ 
(8an(t)) 
,
i.e., XA(t) = A8an(t)^8An(t)n0Xn(t), so Xn(t) is a fundamental solution matrix 
to xA = A8an(t'A(80An(t)yi0x, and from Lemma 7.25, it has an exponential 
dichotomy with the same projection P and the same constants. This is true since 
Q-1 commutes with P. We may take subsequences so that Xn(t0) and Xn-1(t0) 
converge since they are S (8an (t0)) and S-1 (8an (t0)) and these are bounded. Without 
changing notation we may assume that Xn(t0) ^ Y0 and hence X-1 (t0) ^ Z0 
where Z0 = Y0-1. But now for a suitable subsequence Xn(t) converges to a solution

and clearly Y satisfies (7.21) since Xn does for all n. The proof is completed. □
Lemma 7.27 If the homogeneous equation (7.16) has an exponential dichotomy, 
then (7.16) has only one bounded solution Sx(t) = 0.
Proof Let SX(t) be the fundamental solution matrix to (7.16). For any sequence 
a c fl, denote An = A(8an(t))(8An(t))n0, Xn(t) = X(8an(t))(8An(t))n0. Since 
the homogeneous equation (7.16) has an exponential dichotomy, it is easy to 
see that there exists a constant M such that || Xn(t) || < M and || XnA(t) || = 
||An(t)Xn(t)|| < AM, where Ai = supteT ||A(t)||. Therefore, from Corollary 3.4 in 
[179], there exists {ank} := a c a such that {Xnk} converges uniformly on T* and 
lim X (8an(t))(8a (t))n0 exists uniformly on T*. So SX(t) is an 8-almost periodic 
n^+Ж n Ann/
solution with A8n0 -almost periodic affiliated function X(t). Since the homogeneous 
equation (7.16) has an exponential dichotomy, infteT Sx(t) = 0, from Lemma 7.20, 
Sx(t) = 0. This completes the proof. 
□
Lemma 7.28 If the homogeneous equation (7.16) has an exponential dichotomy, 
then all equations in the hull of (7.16) have only one bounded solution Sx (t) = 0.
Proof From Lemma 7.26, all equations in the hull of (7.16) have an exponential 
dichotomy, and according to Lemma 7.27, all equations in the hull of (7.16) have 
only one bounded solution Sx(t) = 0. This completes the proof.

Theorem 7.3 Let A(t) be a A8n0 -almost periodic matrix function with the ASS­
function SAn0 and f(t) be a A8n0 -almost periodic vector function with the ASS­
function Sfn0. If (7.16) admits an exponential dichotomy, then (7.15) has a unique

Next, we will show that Sx(t) is S-almost periodic solution with the Af0-

As an application of the results obtained in the previous sections, now, we will 
consider the following almost periodic dynamic equation with variable delays under 
the matched space (T, F, In*, 8):

xA(t) = SnA0 (t)x(t) + £ Sf0 (t,x (8(Ti(t),t))), 
(7.24)
where A(t) is an A"o-almost periodic matrix function on T, Ti(t) : T* ^ П* is 
A"0-almost periodic on T for every i = 1, 2,... ,n, and f e C(T x Rn, R") is 
A"0-almost periodic uniformly in t for x e R".

(H2) 
There exists M < ------ such that |Sf(t, x) - Sf(t, y) | < M|Sx - Sy | for

Then system (7.24) has a unique 8-almost periodic solution with the A8"0 -almost

Proof For any " e APf0 (T), consider the following equation:

Chapter 8
Almost Automorphic Dynamic Equations
Under Matched Spaces
In this chapter, based on the theory established in Chap. 5, two types of almost 
automorphic solutions of dynamic equations under the matched spaces are dis­
cussed systematically. In Sects. 8.1-8.2, the weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic 
solutions and the n0-order weighted pseudo A-almost automorphic solutions of the 
general inhomogeneous dynamic equations are studied. Moreover, In Sect. 8.3, the 
almost automorphy of the solutions to dynamic equations with shift operators is 
analyzed and some basic results of the discontinuous cases are established.
8.1 Weighted Pseudo 3-Almost Automorphic Solutions for 
Dynamic Equations
The almost automorphic solutions to dynamic equations were considered in many 
publications (see Chang et al. [77-80], Kere et al. [129], Mophou et al. [143], Milce 
et al. [144], N’Guerekata et al. [146, 149-151], Wang et al. [196, 197], Xiao et al. 
[214, 215]). In this section, we will establish some basic results of the weighted 
pseudo S-almost automorphic solutions to dynamic equations under matched spaces 
of time scales.
Let (T, F, In*, S) be a regular matched space for the time scale T, and consider 
the following linear dynamic equation:
xA = A(t)xa, 
(8.1)
where A(t) is a linear operator in the Banach space X and xa (t) = x(a(t)}. We use 
the notation ц. = inftsT ^(t).

8 Almost Automorphic Dynamic Equations Under Matched Spaces
Definition 8.1 (see [148, 202]) T(t,s) : T x T ^ B(X) is a linear evolution 
operator associated to (8.1) if T (t, s) satisfies the following conditions:
(1)T(s,s)= Id,where Id denotes the identity operator in X.
(2) T(t, s)T(s, r) = T(t, r).
(3) The mapping (t, s) ^ T(t, s)x is continuous for any fixed x e X.
To obtain our results, we will introduce the following concepts.
Definition 8.2 Let (T, F, In* ,8) be a matched space. An evolution system T(t,s) 
is called S-exponentially stable if for any т e fl, there exists K0 > 1 and ш > 0

Remark 8.1 From Definition 8.2, if an evolution system T(t,s) is called S-

(H4) IIg(t,x) - g(t,y) II < LgIIx - y II, Vx,y e X.
Definition 8.3 A mild solution to (8.2) is a continuous function x(t) : T ^ X 
satisfying

x(t) = T(t,c)x(c) + 
T(t,s)f (s, x(s)) As
for all t > c and for all c e T.
To investigate the existence and uniqueness of a weighted pseudo 3-almost 
automorphic solution to (8.2), we need the following two lemmas:
Lemma 8.1 Let (T, F, In*,3) be a regular matched space and ST(•) be A- 
differentiable with an upper bound &A for т e fl~. Assume v e AA^(T, X) and 
(H1) is satisfied. If u : T ^ X is the function defined by
u(t) = j T(t, s)v(s)As, t > s,
then u(•) e AAS(T, X).
Proof Clearly, u(t) is a continuous function. Let {sn}^=1 c fl~ be an arbitrary 
sequence of real numbers. Since v is S-almost automorphic, there exists a subse­
quence {тп}“. 1 c {sn}TO 1 such that h(t) := lim v(STr, (t) is well defined for each 
n =1 
n=1 
n ^TO n
t e T.
Now, we consider
u (Sr„(t)) = fStn()}T (STn(t),s ) v(s)As = Г T (STn(t),STn(s)) v (Srn(s)) S^(s)As 
— TO 
— TO
= fTO T(STn(t), Srn(s))sAn(s)v„(STn(s))As, 
where vn(s) = v(8Tn(s), n = 1, 2,.... Also we have

for {en} c fl+, we obtain
lim й(8T -1 (t)) = lim [ Tn 1 °

T*(8T-1 (t), s)h(s)As = u(t).
This shows that u(t) is a standard 8-almost automorphic function. The proof is 
completed.

Lemma 8.2 Let (T, F, In*,8) be a regular matched space and 8T(•) be A- 
differentiable with an upper bound 8^ for t e fl~. Let f = g + ф e 
WPAA8(T, p), where p e UTO. Furthermore, (H1) - (H4) are satisfied and 
{T(t, s) : t > s} is 8-exponentially stable. Then
F( •) = I ° T( • ,s)f(s)As e WPAA8( T, p).

Proof Let F(t) = G(t) + Ф(Р), where
G(t) := У T(t,s)g(s)As and Ф() := j T(t, s)f(s)As.
Then by Lemma 8.1, G(•) e AA8(T, X). Now we prove that Ф(•) e PAA0(T, p). 
First, take 10 e T* such that F(Ai ) = en*, then by Remark 5.3, we have
[8r-1 (t0), 8r(t0)]T = F—1 ([r—1 ,r]n*).

xA = SAn0 (t)x, 
(8.3)
where SA0(t) = A(t)(&An* (t))n0 (t e T) is a linear operator in the Banach space X. 
Definition 8.4 ([148,202]) T(t, s) : T x T ^ B(X) is a linear evolution operator 
associated to (8.3) if T(t, s) satisfies the following conditions:
(1) T(s, s) = Id,where Id denotes the identity operator in X.
(2) T(t,s)T(s,r) = T(t, r).
(3) The mapping (t, s) ^ T (t, s)x is continuous for any fixed x e X.
To obtain our results, we will introduce the following concepts.
Definition 8.5 Let (T, F, In* ,8) be a matched space. An evolution system T(t,s)

Remark 8.2 From Definition 8.5, if an evolution system T(t, s) is called exponen­

such that P(t)+ Q(t) = Id,
|| Q(t)T(t, s)P(s) ||b(X) < Kоeeш(°(t),s), t > s

Lemma 8.3 Under assumption (H5), f e P AA80,n0 if and only if f e P AA08,n0—1.

and thus we get f e P AA80,n0 .

8.3 Almost Automorphic Impulsive Dynamic Equations

In this section, we study the existence of weighted piecewise pseudo S-almost

xA(t) = A(t)xa + f (t, x(t)), t e T, t = tk, k e Z, 
A^x(tk) = x(t+) - x(t-) = Ik(x(tk)), t = tk, 
(8.9)

8.3 Almost Automorphic Impulsive Dynamic Equations Based on Shift Operators
385
where A e PCrd(T, B(X)) is a bounded linear operator in the Banach space X 
and f e PCrd(T x X, X), xa = x(a(t). f, Ik, tk satisfy suitable conditions that 
will be established later and T is a S-CCTS. In addition, the notations x(tk+) and 
x(t-') represent the right-hand and the left-hand side limits of x(•) at tk, respectively. 
In addition, some lemmas are obtained and the exponential stability of weighted 
piecewise pseudo S-almost automorphic mild solutions is also studied. Finally, we 
apply these obtained results to study a class of A-partial differential equations on S- 
CCTS. The obtained results in this section are feasible and effective for q-difference 
partial dynamic equations and more.
For instance, in (8.9), by using the shift operators S±:
(i) If we let T = N2 = {Vn : n e N} and tk = Vk2 + 1, k e Z, then (
) 
becomes
8.9
x( V12 + 1) - x(t) 
V t2+1-1
= A(t)xa + f (t, x(t)), t e T, t = tk, k e Z,
Ax(tk) = x(t+) - x(tk ) = Ik(x(tk)), t = tk.
(ii) If we let T = {qn : q > 1, n e Z} = qZ and tk = qk3, k e Z, then (
)
8.9
becomes
x(qt)- x(t) 
a /

—(q-1 )t— = A(t)x + J t,x(t) , t e T , t = tk, k e Z, 
2ix(tk) = x(t+) - x(t-) = Ik(x(tk)), t = tk.
(iii) Ifwe let T = hZ,h>0 and tk = hk3, k e Z, then (
) becomes
8.9
x(t+h)-x(t) = A(t)xa + f (t, x(t)), t e T, t = tk,k e Z, 
Ax(tk) = x(t+) - x(t-) = Ik(x(tk)), t = tk.
(iv) If we let T = {(-q)n : q > 1, n e Z} U {0, 1} and tk = (-q)3k, k e Z, 
then (8.9) becomes
x(qit) - x(t) 
a f
—(qt-1 )t— = A(t)x + J t,x(t) , t e T, t = tk, k e Z,
Ax(tk) = x(t+) - x(t-) = Ik (x(tk)), t = tk,
where qt = q2 if t>0 and qt = 1/q2 if t<0: it is a classical q -dynamic 
system on quantum-like hybrid domains.
These provide four types of impulsive evolution dynamic equation; in fact, (8.9) 
will become other different types of dynamic equations on different types of 
complete-closed time scales attached with shift direction under translational or non- 
translational shifts.

8 Almost Automorphic Dynamic Equations Under Matched Spaces
Now, we investigate the existence and exponential stability of a piecewise 
weighted pseudo S-almost automorphic mild solution to Eq. (8.9). For this, we will 
provide a lemma which will be used in our main results.
Lemma 8.6 Let T be bi-direction S-CCTS under shifts S± and S + be 2- 
differentiable to its second argument with S+(s, •) < +2 (s e П-), where +2 
is a positive number. Assuming that m e R+, for all t e T, a e П-, there exist 
constants в 1 ,a, в2,a > 0 such that
в 1 ,«»() < д(+ + (a, t)) < в2,av(t). 
(8.10)
Then there exist positive constants K* and m* such that
ee4S + (a,t),S + (a, s^ < K*eem* (t,s), t > s.
Proof Clearly, if д = 0, T = R, the result holds. Assume that д ^ 0. Since 
©m e R+, one has

ee4s + (a, t),S + (a, s^ = [eQв 1 ,„®(М)]в2,a < K*eem* (t, s),
where m* = в 1 ,am. This completes the proof.
□
Remark 8.3 Note that if д(t) is bounded, then there exist a sufficiently small 
constant в 1 ,a > 0 and a sufficiently large constant в2,a > 0 such that (8.10) is 
valid. Therefore, Lemma 8.6 holds when T is an almost periodic time scale from 
[202].
For the time scale from (1) in Example 3.3.2, we obtain

Hence, for all t e T*, a < 1, we can obtain a^(t) < ^(8 + (a, t)} < 1 ^(t).
Consider the impulsive linear A-evolution equation
xA — A(t)xa, t e T, 
(8.11)
where A : T ^ B(X) is a linear operator in the Banach space X. We denote by 
B(X, Y) the Banach space of all bounded linear operators from X to Y. This is 
simply denoted as B(X) when X — Y.
Definition 8.7 (see [148]) T(t, s) : T x T ^ B(X) is a linear evolution operator 
associated to (8.11) if T(t,s) satisfies the following conditions:
(1) T(s, s) — Id,where Id denotes the identity operator in X.
(2) T(t, s)T(s, r) — T(t, r).
(3) The mapping (t, s) ^ T (t, s)x is continuous for any fixed x e X.
Definition 8.8 A function x : T ^ X is called a mild solution of Eq. (8.9) if for 
any t e T,t>c,c— tk ,ke Z, one has
x(t) — T(t,c)x(c) + £ T(t,s)f (s, x(s))As + 
T(t,tk)Ik(x(tk)).
In the following, we will consider (8.9) with the following assumptions:
(H1 ) Let T be bi-direction S-CCTS under shifts 8± and 8+ be A-differentiable to 
its second argument with 8 + (s, •) < 8A (s e П ), where 8A is a positive 
number.
(H2) The family {A(t) : t e T} of operators in X generates an S-exponentially 
stable evolution system {T(t, s) : t > s}, i.e., there exist K0 > 1 and rn > 0 
such that
IIT(t, s)IIB(X) < 1 + K°tt^e©«(t, s), t > s,^ e R+. 
(8.12)
(H3) f — g + ф e WPAAS(T, p), where p e UB and f (t, •) is uniformly 
continuous in each bounded subset of Q uniformly in t e T; Ik is a weighted 
pseudo S-almost periodic sequence, Ik(x) is uniformly continuous in x e Q

then u0(•) e AAS(T, X).
Proof Let {sn}n=1 с П-. Since v is almost automorphic, there exists a subse­
quence {тп}П=1 с {sn}П=1 such that h(t) := limn^TO v(S + (Tn, t^ is well defined 
for each t e T.

to the second argument, i.e.,
|| f(t,x) - f(t, y)|| < L 1||x - y||, t e T, x,y e Q.
(A3) Ik is a weighted pseudo S-almost periodic sequence, and there exists a

Proof Consider the nonlinear operator Г given by

Applications to Dynamics Models Under

Check for 
updates
In this chapter, based on the theory of almost periodic functions with shift operators 
proposed in the previous chapters, we will introduce some new types of neutral 
impulsive stochastic dynamical models on irregular time scales. In Sect. 9.1, by 
using almost periodic results of stochastic dynamic equations with shift operators, 
the mean-square almost periodic solutions for a new type of neutral impulsive 
stochastic Lasota-Wazewska timescale model are investigated. In Sect. 9.2, the 
mean-square almost periodic stochastic process with shift operators is applied to 
study the almost periodic oscillations for delay impulsive stochastic Nicholson’s 
blowflies timescale model on hybrid time scales.
9.1 Almost Periodic Neutral Impulsive Stochastic 
Lasota-Wazewska Timescale Model
In 1999, Gopalsamy and Trofimchuk [109] studied the existence of an almost 
periodic solution of the Lasota-Wazewska-type delay differential equation which 
was used by Wazewska-Czyzewska and Lasota [210] as a model for the survival 
of red blood cells in an animal. Since then periodic and almost periodic solutions 
for this classical model have been widely generalized to discrete model, impulsive 
model, timescale model, etc., and studied successfully (see [109, 184]). However, 
these published results cannot include q-difference Lasota-Wazewska model since 
the time scale qZ := {qn : q > 1, n e Z} is not periodic time scale under 
translation. It is known that the q -difference equations are very important dynamic 
equations which can be applied to model the linear and nonlinear problems and 
play an important role in different fields of engineering and biological science (see 
[19, 65]). In this section, we will establish some results on almost periodic problems 
of q -difference Lasota-Wazewska model.

9 Applications to Dynamics Models Under Matched Spaces
9.1.1 Introduction and Model Description
In the work [184], the authors proposed a type of impulsive Lasota-Wazewska model 
with patch structure and forced perturbations to describe the number of red blood 
cells when blood transfusion is conducted among the animal group. On the other 
hand, in the aspect of life and engineering sciences, most phenomena are basically 
modeled as suitable stochastic processes, where relevant parameters are modeled as 
suitable stochastic processes (see [220, 221]). Based on the background of blood 
transfusion, we will establish a new neutral impulsive stochastic timescale Lasota- 
Wazewska model involving q-difference model. First, by virtue of time scales 
calculus and new periodic notions of time scales proposed by M. Adivar, we will 
introduce two new concepts of mean-square almost periodic stochastic process and 
consider the following timescale model:

Aixi (tk) = xi (t+) - xi (t+) = Iik(xi (tk)') + aikxi (tk) + vik, t = tk,
(9.1) 
where Xi denotes the number of the red blood cells at time t of the ith animal, ci (t) 
is the stimulative rate of the generation of red blood cells per unit time, and Ti is 
the stimulative time needed to produce blood cells of the ith animal. ai is the rate 
of death of the red blood cells of the ith animal, eij and Yij describe the generation 
of red blood cells per unit time, and Tij is the time needed to produce blood cells of 
the ith animal when blood of the jth animal is transfused into the ith one. AXi (t) 
denotes a A-stochastic differential of xi(t), ai, eij, Yij e PCrd(T, R+), Ti, Tij, aij 
are some positive constants, {tk} e B, B = {{tk} : tk e T, tk < tk +1, k e

is Borel measurable, i = 1, 2,. ..,n, j = 1, 2,... ,m, k e Z and A = (Hij)nxm 
is a diffusion coefficient matrix (i.e., the random perturbation term for the system). 
The operators 8± : T* ^ T* are shift operators satisfying all the conditions in 
Definition 3 from [33] (here T* = T, T* denotes the closure of T, i.e., T* is the 
largest subset of T). Let (Q, F, P) be a complete probability space furnished with a 
complete family of right continuous increasing sub-a-algebras {Ft : t e [0, +^)T} 
satisfying Ft c F. rn(t) = (o>1 (t), ш2(t),..., rnm(t) is an m-dimensional standard 
Brownian motion over (Q, F, P). Some sufficient conditions are obtained ensuring 
the existence of mean-square almost periodic solutions for system (9.1) by inverse 
operator theorem and fixed point theorem.
For convenience, we use notation fM = supteT |f (t)|, where f(t) is a mean­
square almost periodic function under shift operators 8± .

Г : E ^ EE is defined by (rx)(t) = x(t) + c(t)x(St- (t)) := y(t).
Lemma 9.1 If 0 < c(t) < 1, then Г has a bounded inverse Г-1 on E, and for all 
x e E,
(Г-1 x)(t) = 
fl (-1 )jc (S[ - (t)) x (S{- (t)),
and || Г-1 x || < x , where S- (t, t) := St (t), Sk (t) = S-(t, Sk-1 (t)), k e Z.

By using Lemma 9.1, (9.1) can be written in the following form:

where Vi(yi(t)) = с^Г- yf)(8-(ti, t)).
Now, we introduce the following assumptions:

the shift operators S±, 0 < ci(t) < 1, ai(t) > к > 0, к, t1, т-, aij are positive

Since the linear system (9.2) is the same as the linear system (2.6) from [173], 
the Cauchy matrix of (9.2) is (2.7) from [173]. Under the assumptions (A1) — (A3), 
by replacing t + т with S + (t, t) and replacing t + s with S + (s, t) in Lemmas 2.4-2.5 
from [173], respectively, and repeating the same proof process, one can also obtain 
the similar results. Therefore, we can provide the following lemmas without proof.
Lemma 9.2 If the conditions (A 1) — (A3) hold, then for each e > 0 there exist 
e 1 : 0 < e 1 < e, relatively dense sets T c T* of real numbers and Q of whole 
integers, such that the following relations are fulfilled:

Lemma 9.3 If conditions (A1) and (A3) hold, then:
(1) For the Cauchy matrix W(t,s)ofthe system (9.2), there exist positive constants 
K and к such that || W(t, s) || < Ke — ^(t — p(s,'), t > s, t, s e T.
(2) For any e > 0, t, s e T, t > s, 11 — tk | > e > 0, |s — tk| > 0, k e Z, there 
exist a relatively dense set T c T© of e-almost periods of the functions ai (t)

and a positive constant Г such that for т e T, it follows
|| W(3 + (т, t), 8 + (т, s)) - W(t, s) || < еГe—2(t—p(s)).
9.1.3 Existence of Mean-Square Almost Periodic Solution
In this section, we state and prove the result concerning the existence of mean-square 
positive almost periodic solutions for (9.1).
Theorem 9.1 If conditions (A1) - (A4) are fulfilled and if (A5) holds, i.e., the

then there exists a unique piecewise mean-square almost periodic solution x(t) of 
system (9.1) in the region
B* = p : <p e PCrd(T, L2(Rn)), Eh<p(t)||2 < (YKM) ,t e tJ.
Proof By Definition 2.9 from [173], for (9.2), we construct
B* = {e : e e PCrd(T, L2(Rn)), Eh<p)t)||2 < K0, t e T};
thus, (9.2) has an almost periodic solution in B* which is equivalent to (9.1) having 
an almost periodic solution in B*. Now, we define an operator S in B* as follows:
Se = 1 W(t,o(s))ge(s)As + g W(t,tk)hke - j W(t,a(s))Av(s)Arn(s),

9.2 Almost Periodic Impulsive Stochastic Nicholson’s 
Blowflies Timescale Model
It is well known that Nicholson’s blowflies model
N'(t) = -yN(t) + pN(t - т)е-aN(t-T)
was proposed by Gurney et al. in [115] to describe the population of the Australian 
sheep blowfly and to agree with Nicholson’s experimental data [152]. Here, N(t) 
is the size of the population at time t, p is the maximum per capita daily egg 
production, 1/a is the size at which the population reproduces at its maximum 
rate, y is the per capita daily adult death rate, and т is the generation time. The 
model and its modifications have been extensively and intensively studied and 
numerous results about its stability, persistence, attractivity, periodic solutions, 
almost periodic solutions, etc. (see [74—76, 88, 91, 94, 95, 100, 101]) have been 
obtained. Furthermore, with the theory of time scale introduced by Hilger [119], the 
discrete and classical Nicholson’s blowflies model and other models “in between” 
have been studied successfully (see [173, 194]).
However, these published results will be only restricted to traditional periodic 
time scales and they cannot include q-difference Nicholson’s blowflies model and 
more since the time scale qZ := {qn : q > 1, n e Z} is not periodic time scale 
under translation. It is known that the q -difference equations play a huge role in 
applied dynamic systems because it can be used to model the linear and nonlinear 
problems and play an important part in different fields of engineering and biological 
science (see [19, 65]), but there is no result on almost periodic dynamics of q- 
difference Nicholson’s blowflies model.
In 2013, M. Adivar introduced a new concept of periodic time scales under 
which qZ becomes a periodic time scale. This useful tool was used to study 
periodic solutions for dynamic equations on larger types of time scales. In the 
work [187], the authors introduced the concept of almost periodic stochastic process 

406
9 Applications to Dynamics Models Under Matched Spaces
on this new type of periodic time scales, which make it possible to study almost 
periodic dynamic systems and models on the time scale qZ and other irregular time 
scales. Qualitative analysis of stochastic model has attracted the attention of many 
mathematicians and biologists due to the fact the natural extension ofa deterministic 
model is stochastic model. In the aspect of life sciences, most phenomena are 
basically modeled as suitable stochastic processes, where relevant parameters are 
modeled as suitable stochastic process. However, this stochastic process is often 
discontinuous or perturbed by a sudden change in practical applications, which 
indicate that the dynamic behavior of solutions for impulsive dynamic systems 
should be taken into account (see Afonso et al. [41, 42], Bainov et al. [48], 
Benchohra et al. [52, 53], Graef et al. [116]).
9.2.1 Model Description
Now we will introduce two new concepts of almost periodic stochastic process 
under periodic time scales with shift operators S± (see Chap.3). Then we will 
consider the following neutral impulsive stochastic Nicholson’s blowflies timescale 
model:
Mxi (t) - ci (t)xi (S-(Ti,t))] =
- ai(t)xi(t)
m

Axi(t) = x(tk + 0) — x(tk — 0) = aikx(tk) + Iik(xi(tk)) + vik, t = tk,
(9.6)
where Axi(t) denotes a A-stochastic differential of xi(t), ai, ci, ej, Yj e 
PCrd(T, R+), 0 < ci(t) < 1, Hi e PCrd(T x L2(R), R+), Ti, nij, °i are positive 
constants, {tk} e B, B = {{tk} : tk e T, tk < tk +1, k e Z, limk -±\ = ±o>}, 
the delay kernel kij e C((—^, 0]T, R+), and f0„ kj(t)At < kM, where kM is a

positive constant. The constants aik, vik e R and Iik e CL2(R), R), Sj is Borel 
measurable, i = 1, 2,...,n, j = 1, 2,...,m, k e Z, and A = (Sij)nxm is a 
diffusion coefficient matrix. Here, in this model, xi (t) is the size of the population 
at time t in the ith unit, pij(t') is the maximum per capita daily egg production at 
time t in the ith unit, 1/Yij (t) is the size at which the population reproduces at 
its maximum rate at time t in the ith unit, ai(t) is the per capita daily adult death 
rate at time t in the ith unit, H := (H1,H2,...,Hn)T is the nonlinear harvesting 
term, and A = (Sij)nxm is the random perturbation term for the system. It is 
more practical to consider the neutral impulsive stochastic Nicholson’s blowflies 
timescale model (9.6). In fact, Australian sheep blowfly always live in different 
groups, not constantly live in the single group, because every member of the same

9.2 Almost Periodic Impulsive Stochastic Nicholson’s Blowflies Timescale. . .
407
group may fly to other group and live in a new environment. However, such a 
movement brings many problems, for example, infectious diseases, the variation 
of copulation structure, etc.; these factors will largely influence the population size 
of sheep blowfly in each unit. Hence, it is more accurate to consider the model 
with patch structure like (9.6) so that every group of Australian sheep blowfly is 
able to impact each other. In model (9.6), the function ci (t) is positive to adjust the 
population size of the Australian sheep blowfly in the ith unit, if there are infectious 
diseases or the sex ratio imbalance among the group, and the population size in this 
unit will be reduced. In the ith unit, the delay kernel kij reflects the influence of 
the past population density of the sheep blowfly from each jth unit. As a matter 
of fact, the migration of sheep blowfly is a frequent phenomenon; each member 
from different groups in the past will have an influence on the population size in 
the future; this additive effect will be described by a memory function that reflects 
the influence of the past density. Therefore, the model (9.6) is more applicable and 
practical than the traditional model. Meanwhile, considering some sudden changes 
and random variation during the reproduction process of population, for example, 
artificial control or unexpected natural disaster, it is necessary and more precise to 
establish the model (9.6) which includes various factors that might happen during 
investigating the population size of sheep blowfly in each unit.
Let (Q, F, P) be a complete probability space furnished with a complete family 
of right continuous increasing sub-a-algebras {Ft : t e [0, +^)T} satisfying 
Ft c F. w(f) = («1 (t), ш2(t),..., rnm(t) is an m-dimensional standard Brownian 
motion over (Q, F, P). Some sufficient conditions are obtained ensuring the 
existence and exponential stability of mean-square almost periodic solutions for 
system (9.6) by functional analysis and Gronwall-Bellman inequality.
For convenience, we use notation fM = supteT | f (t) |, where f (•) is a mean­
square almost periodic function under shift operators S±, the concepts of which will 
be introduced in the next section.

Let E be the stochastic process space formed by all almost periodic stochastic

Г : E ^ E be defined by (rx)(t) = x(t) - c(t)x (ST- (t)) := y(t).
Lemma 9.4 If 0 < c(t) < 1, then Г has a bounded inverse Г-1 on E, and for all 
x e E,
(Г-1 x)(t) =

By mathematical induction. For j = 1, we have
^rx)(t) = c(f)x(8(t, t));
for j = 2,
((ДГ)2 c ) (t) = c (8r(t)) x (82 (t));
for j = 3,
((ДГ)3 x ) (t) = c(t)c (8r(t)) c (82 (t)) x (8| (t)).
Assume that j = k implies that ((ЛГ)1^)(t) = П0<i<k_1 c(8lT(t))x(8T(t)), 
consider j = k + 1, and we obtain
((ДГ)к +1 x) (t) = (ДГ) ((ДГ)kx) (t) = (ДГ)^ [J c (8[(t)) x (8kT(t)))
= c(t) П c (8(T,8[(t))) x (8(T,8kr(t)))
= c(t) [J c (8T+1 (t)) x (8г(8кт+1))

0<i <k
Thus, for arbitrary j e N, we have ((ДГ)Р)(t) = П0<i<j_1 c(8lT(t))x(8i(t)). 
Therefore, for arbitrary j e N, the above equation holds. By inverse operator 
theorem (see [73, 212]), we have

By using Lemma 9.4, (9.6) can be written in the following form:

(9.7)
where Vi(yi(t)) = — Ci(t)(ri-1 у)8 — (Ti,t).
By Equation (2.7) from [173], the Cauchy matrix of the linear system (9.7) is
W(t,s) =
diag( (e—a 1 (t,s),e—a 2 (t,s), ..., e—an(t,s)), tk—1 < s < t < tk, 
diag( П k=m—1 (1 + a 1 j)—a 1 (t, s), П k=m—1 (1 + a 2 j}e—a 2 (t, s'),...,
Пk=m — 1 (1 + Unj)e—an(t,s), tm — 1 < s <tm <tk < t < tk + 1.
Thus the solution of (9.7) is in the form x(t; 10,<pо) = W(t,t0)pо, tо e T,<pо e

Now, we introduce the following assumptions:
(H 1) The functions ai, ci, eij, Yj : T ^ R+ are mean-square almost periodic

The delay kernels kj e ((—^, 0]T, R+) and j'0x> kj(t)At < kM, kM > 0
are positive constants, i = 1, 2,...,n, j= 1, 2,...,m.
(H3) The sequences {aik}, {vik} are almost periodic in k and the sequences

and there exist constants Li0 such that

Also, following the proof of Lemma 3.2 in [173], the following result is 
immediate.
Lemma 9.6 If the conditions (H1) and (H3), (H4) hold, then
(1) For the Cauchy matrix W(t, s) of the system (9.7), there exist positive constants K 
and X such that || W(t, s) || < Ke-k(t-p(s), t > s, t, s e T.
(2) For any e > 0, t, s e T, t > s, 11 - tk | > e > 0, |s - tk | > 0, k e Z, there exist a
relatively dense set T C T* of e-almost periods of the functions ai (t) and a positive 
constant Г1 such that for т e T, it follows
||W(8 + (т, t), 8 + (т, ^)) - W(t, s)|| < ef e-~2(t-ps).
Remark 9.1 For t > s and X > 0, by using the inequality e-(■--s) < eq(tt,s), we 
obtain || W(t, s) || < Keqx (t, p(s)) and
|| W(8 + (т, t), 8 + (t,s)') - W(t,s) || < eree(x/2) (t, p(s))
which will be applied in the next subsection.

In this section, we will establish some sufficient conditions to guarantee the exis­
tence and exponential stability of mean-square positive almost periodic solutions

To give the main results, we introduce the following assumption:

then:
(1) 
There exists a unique piecewise mean-square almost periodic solution x(t) of system 
(
) in the region
9.6
B* = |^5: фе PCrd(T, L((Rn)), Eh<p(t)||2 < (YKM) ,t e t]•
(2) 
The solution x(t) in the region B* is exponentially stable.
Proof By Definition 2.9 from [173], for (9.7), we consider
B* = {Ф : Ф e PCrd(T, L2(Rn)), Ehф(1) 112 < K°2, t e T},
then, (9.7) has an almost periodic solution in B*, which is equivalent to (9.6) having an 
almost periodic solution in B*. Since the function space PCrd T, L2(Rn) is a particular 
case of the function space Lp (T) from Subsection 3.3 in [161], according to Lemma 3.6 
from [161], we have PCrd(T, L2(Rn)) as a Banach space. It is obvious that B* is a 
closed subset of PCrd(T, L2(Rn)), so B* is also a Banach space.
Now, we define an operator 5 in B* as follows:
5ф = l‘ W(t,o(s))g^As + £ W(t,tk)hk - l‘ W(t,o(s))Av(s)Am(s),

Then from (9.10) and the conditions of Theorem 9.2, it follows that 5 is a contraction in 
B*. Hence, there exists a unique mean-square almost periodic solution of (9.6).
In the following, we will prove that this unique mean-square almost periodic solution 
is exponentially stable.
Let y(t) be a solution of (9.7) with initial condition
y(t; 10, ф0) = ф0(t), t e (-ж, 0]t; 
y(t+; ’0, ф0) = ф0(t0
Since any solution of system (9.7) can be represented as
X(t) = W(t, 10)v0 + f W(t, a(s))gi(s)As + V W(t, tk)hkk 
Jt0 10< tk<t

Thus, under the conditions of Theorem 9.2, the solutions for system (9.7) are expo­

Finally, we obtain the inequality p Q Л < 0. Then by Theorem 9.2, the impulsive 
stochastic system (9.6) has a unique piecewise mean-square almost periodic solution 
which is exponentially stable in the region B *, where
B* = P e PCrd(T, L(R2)) : EhV(t)||2 < 1-KcM - 1.1765, t e T
In Sect. 4.3, we introduced two concepts of almost periodic stochastic process 
based on a new type of periodic time scales with shift operators 8±. Hence, almost 
periodic problems of q -difference equations and more dynamic equations can be 
considered. Applying the results obtained in this subsection, we can immediately 
obtain the existence and exponential stability of almost periodic solution for the 
following impulsive stochastic q -difference equation:

some important irregular time scales, for example, the more general quantum time 
scale
(-q)Z = {(-q)n, q > 1, n e Z}, etc.
Finally, we remark that one can also apply the notions and methods to study other 
types of dynamical models involving q-difference models on time scales.
