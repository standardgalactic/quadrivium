Tony Bingham
If you’ve ever used your smart phone or mobile device to look 
something up, you’ve experienced mobile learning. Mobile 
devices are the consummate “just in time” learning tool, and they 
are remaking the learning profession.
I gave my first speech on mobile learning at the 2011 ASTD 
International Conference & Exposition. The topic of mobile 
learning was beginning to resonate in the training and develop-
ment field as the proliferation of smart phones and the emer-
gence of tablets caused all of us to realize the power these devices 
had for learning. ASTD has published three research reports on 
the topic since then, and a recurring theme in those reports is that 
organizations know mobile learning is an important component 
of a comprehensive learning strategy, but many either don’t know 
where to start or don’t believe they have the resources necessary 
to create and sustain a mobile learning strategy.
That is why I am so pleased that Chad Udell and Gary Woodill 
have collaborated to make this book, Mastering Mobile Learning: 
Tips and Techniques for Success, possible. In these pages, you will 
find great information not only on how to get started, but why to 
start—now.
Mobile learning isn’t a fad. Smart phone sales continue to 
soar, and the reason is that people want their mobile phones for 
more than phone calls. A March 2013 report from IDC states:
Driving volumes forward will be an increasing emphasis on smart 
phones, further penetration into emerging markets, and ongoing 
replacements on a worldwide basis. Looking ahead to 2017, IDC 
believes that total mobile phone shipments will reach 2,281.4 mil-
lion units worldwide . . .

“The worldwide mobile phone market is poised for slow and 
certain growth, but the profile of the market is changing,” says 
Ramon Llamas, research manager with IDC’s Mobile Phones team. 
“Voice connectivity has always been the cornerstone of mobile 
telephony, but the proliferation of 3G and 4G takes the experi-
ence into data transmission and consumption. Consequently, we 
expect 3G mobile phones to make up a growing majority share of 
the overall market, while 4G mobile phones grow at a faster rate 
than the overall market.”
In some countries, people have mobile phones, but not com-
puters. Students in school today—the future workforce—use 
smart phones to access and share information every day. Mobile 
technology is transforming homework. A colleague recently told 
me that her high school student used Apple’s Siri and YouTube 
videos accessed via his smart phone to complete a research paper. 
Do you think when he and his peers get into the workplace that 
they’ll expect to have relevant learning content delivered to their 
mobile devices? Of course they will.
It is time for the learning profession to dive in, and Chad and 
Gary are pointing the way.
The book is laid out in five parts and provides the most com-
prehensive guidance on mobile learning adoption and imple-
mentation that I’ve seen. Chad and Gary have enlisted experts to 
help create this book, and you will benefit from their thoughtful 
contributions. From the honest assessment of what mobile learn-
ing is—and as importantly, what it is NOT (spoiler alert: it is not 
e-learning on a mobile device) in Part 1, to the last section, which 
provides an excellent assessment on one of the most-reported bar-
riers of mobile learning adoption—how to keep up with the new 
developments in the space—Chad and Gary provide a roadmap 
that is useful for every learning professional.
One of my favorite sections is Part 2, “Strategic Thinking About 
Mobile Learning.” Included are two chapters that both address 
the business case and the business drivers for mobile learning. 
Learning and development efforts achieve their best results when 
they are aligned with business goals and objectives. Understanding 
the business case for mobile learning—and being able to effectively 
advocate for its adoption—is a critical component in achieving 
more mlearning penetration in more organizations.

Mobile technology is changing the world and our experience 
of it. From an organizational perspective, mobile learning allows 
for a spectrum of possibilities that were not present before, and 
they continue to evolve. You, as learning professionals, impact 
organizations in ways other functional areas cannot, because you 
develop the talents of the people who do the work to achieve busi-
ness goals. It makes sense that you should use the most effective 
tools and resources you can to do your best work. Mobile is one of 
those tools. Chad and Gary’s book shows you how.

This book is a true collaborative effort on the part of many peo-
ple at Float Mobile Learning. It is based on almost five years of 
blog posts, whitepapers, presentations, webinars, and newsletters 
from several members of the Float team, all on the topic of mobile 
learning. This aggregation of blog posts and other materials has 
been curated, merged, edited, extended, and updated to pro-
duce the chapters of this book. The book is for people wanting 
to learn more about the process of strategizing, designing, and 
implementing the emerging set of mobile learning technologies 
and the content and experiences that they make possible. The 
sequence of chapters in the book roughly follows a roadmap that 
we have developed for clients that outlines the entire process of 
implementing mobile learning, from initial stages of vision and 
planning, to choices about infrastructure, the design of content, 
and the management of the implementation of mobile learning 
systems.
One of the messages we want to relay is that, while mobile 
learning is doable, it is not simply a matter of using a mobile device  
to send training content to employees. It is more complicated 
than that, for many reasons. While it is new and still constantly 
changing, mobile learning is already happening and producing 
real benefits for those who have the vision and skills to carry it 
out. The material in this book is designed to make you better 
equipped to design and build mobile learning solutions in enter-
prise environments. After reading this book, we hope that you 
will appreciate the thought and planning that need to go into  
any mobile learning project and be able to master mobile learn-
ing yourself.
We want to thank many people for their contributions to this 
volume, starting with all the authors. As well, this project was 
only possible with the material support and encouragement of 

Tom Marchal, president and CEO of Float Mobile Learning, and 
John Feser, COO of Float Mobile Learning. Thank you, Tom  
and John. Because of them, Float has a community of support  
in terms of colleagues who make our work better and easier  
every day.
At Wiley, Senior Editor Matthew Davis was the first person to 
appreciate the materials that the Float team had produced, and 
he ably facilitated the process that brought this book to fruition. 
Ryan Noll, senior editorial assistant, steered the book into pro-
duction. Thank you to both of you, where Dawn Kilgore expertly 
moved it through the process. Thank you to all at Wiley involved 
with this project. And thanks to Matt Forcum for the amazing car-
toons featured throughout the book.
Chad Udell would like to thank his wife, Renee Udell, for the 
care, love, and support she offers. Of course, he wants to thank 
his children, Sophia, Liam, and Carter, who never fail to enter-
tain and amaze him. Chad also wants to thank his colleagues and 
friends at Bradley University, Jim Ferolo, and others, for their con-
tinued support and collaboration. Finally, Chad’s parents, Bill and 
Jan, continue to give him inspiration and something to strive for. 
Thank you all so much.
Gary Woodill would like to thank his wife, Karen Anderson, for 
her loving support each day, and his colleagues at his consulting 
company, i5 Research—Sheilagh Marchand-Pegg, Matt Campbell, 
and Karen Balcomb—who have provided stellar backup over the 
past four years. A heartfelt thank you.
Gary and Chad would also like to thank Justin Brusino, com-
munity of practice manager, Learning Technologies, at ASTD, 
and Tony Bingham, ASTD’s CEO, for their continued support for 
this project and for advancing mobile learning in the marketplace 
and raising awareness of its benefits to the diverse ASTD commu-
nities and members.
On behalf of Float, Chad and Gary would like to thank any 
and all of you who have continued to read our content, hear our 
message, and connect with us in the community. We know we have 
some of the very best clients in the world, and because of you, 
we’ve been lucky enough to amass this experience and expertise. 
Thank you very much.

I N T R O D U C T I O N
Chad Udell and Gary Woodill
The adoption of each new technology goes through a set of pre-
dictable stages. At first, the technology is just an idea percolating 
in the imaginations of a few visionaries, who see the possibilities, 
but are not in a position to deliver the technology. Then, one or 
two inventive individuals or companies builds an initial piece of 
equipment that incorporates some of these ideas, but is usually a 
much cruder version of the technology that comes later. As time 
goes on, more and more people develop expertise in the new 
technology and start to expand on it and share it.
Mobile learning has followed this pattern. From its first 
beginnings in the early 1990s, mobile learning has grown from a 
few experimental sites to a wave of new users in educational and 
training settings, with a growing body of knowledge on how to 
use this new learning technology in the most optimal way. The 
authors and editors of this book have developed a rich knowl-
edge base about mobile learning from working with clients and 
the learning and development (L&D) industry over the past five 
years. We now want to share what we have learned with others in 
the industry, in order to help grow this new and exciting field.
The state of the mobile learning industry is rapidly chang-
ing around the world. The American Society for Training and 
Development’s (ASTD) 2013 State of the Industry Report confirmed 

2    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
that, as of 2012, mobile learning contributed only about 1.5 per-
cent to the formal training hours offered by organizations, but 
that figure is misleading, as the report explains:
The 2013 ASTD/i4cp study, Going Mobile: Creating Practices That 
Transform Learning, found one of the major challenges of imple-
menting mobile learning is measuring its use and effectiveness. 
Forty-one percent of respondents in that study who use mobile 
learning admit that their organizations do not have metrics in 
place to assess the program’s effectiveness. Over half of survey 
respondents say their organizations use mobile learning for just-in-
time learning (65 percent), job aids (63 percent), and on-the-job 
support (52 percent). How much time an employee spends in an 
app, accessing this valuable information, may prove to be elusive as 
organizations are challenged to measure it.
This quote reinforces our strong view that mobile learning is 
mostly not about formal training. We also learn by looking things 
up when we need an answer, watching videos on our own time, 
and by chatting with others. All of these activities, and more, 
are available through the use of mobile devices. The problem is 
that these activities are often not thought of as learning, because 
they are not part of a formal curriculum developed by a train-
ing department. But, by using these activities, employees are still 
learning, often gaining knowledge that they can use immediately, 
retain, or come back to later.
The purpose of this book is to shift the thinking of learning 
leaders, instructional designers, and educational app developers 
working in large organizations to see learning differently when 
it comes to mobile. We want to show that appropriate and rele-
vant learning can happen anywhere, any time, and any place, if 
you are equipped with a mobile device such as a smart phone or 
tablet computer. Beyond that, we want to help readers see the 
development of large-scale mobile learning as doable, using tips 
and techniques that we have learned and developed over the past 
few years.
We have organized the book as a means to success with mobile 
learning. It follows the same path as the roadmap that we use with 
our clients, and follows a broad sequence of five areas that you 
need to master if you are going to develop and deploy effective 
mobile learning in your organization.

INTRODUCTION    3
The book is a compilation of the experiences of a group of 
authors, all associated with Float Mobile Learning, a learning 
technology company headquartered in Morton, Illinois, USA. 
Most of the essays in this book were originally written as blog posts 
over a four-year period, and are based on a wealth of actual expe-
riences assisting clients to develop mobile learning in their own 
organizations.
The book is divided into five parts, each corresponding with a 
major phase of the development and delivery of mobile learning.
We think that it is important to understand mobile learning in 
some depth before launching into a specific project. As our col-
league, John Feser, Float’s COO, argues in Part 1, mobile learning, 
in his (and our) view, is not an extension of e-learning, but a set of 
disruptive shifts in how learning and development will be carried 
out in the near future. Executives must care about mobile learn-
ing, because the shifts identified by John will definitely impact the 
bottom line of companies. There are at least seven shifts in how 
learning will be carried out in enterprises, as outlined in Chapter 2 
by Gary Woodill, Float’s senior analyst.
So where to start? At Float we believe strongly that you need to 
start with a mobile learning strategy, says Scott McCormick, Float’s 
director of client relations, in Part 2. That takes into account 
what Chad Udell, Float’s managing director, calls the six Ps 
(Platforms, Policies, Procurement, Provisioning, Publishing, and  
Procedures). Scott, Chad, Gary, and John then present a group of 
chapters with details on different aspects of developing a mobile 
learning strategy.
In Part 3, the same group of authors writes about the varieties 
of activities and experiences that can fall under the category of 
mobile learning. Gary introduces the important concept of “affor-
dances” to describe the different capabilities of mobile computing 
technologies and how these capabilities can be applied to carry 
out a specific training mission. It is important to understand the 
instructional design choices with mobile learning, before setting 
out to create mobile learning activities and experiences.
Part 4 is on the design and development possibilities of 
mobile learning, based on all we have learned over the past five 
years in this field. Because many companies want to start by con-
verting existing print and electronic learning materials, Chad 
discusses the impact of ubiquity and mobility in designing for 

4    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
mobile learning and lists a number of considerations in design-
ing mobile learning from existing content. A number of formats 
are available for developing mobile materials, as Heather Ford, 
Float’s senior designer, indicates in her chapter on digital publi-
cations, and Daniel Pfeiffer, a programmer at Float, tells us about 
designing for multiple screen formats. In this section, Gary also 
talks about design for both assessments and social media, while 
Jim Ferolo, Float’s director of user experience, writes about gen-
eral mobile learning design principles, as well as the specific 
experience of designing a geolocation-based app. Part 4 also 
includes chapters on solving technical issues in mobile learning.
Then, in Part 5, Adam Bockler, social media and marketing 
manager at Float, looks at how mobile learning can be integrated 
with social media. Chad deals with the important issue of security 
in a mobile world in this section of the book, while Jim argues that 
training in mobile development is critical for success in the imple-
mentation of mobile learning. The book ends with Gary’s thoughts 
on managing a large-scale mobile learning project, as well as a 
chapter on keeping up with new developments in this field.
This is not an academic book with lots of references and foot-
notes, or discussions of theory or esoteric concepts. Rather, it is 
intended as a practical primer of useful thinking and experience 
with developing mobile learning in the real world. If you read the 
book using the sequence of sections that we have provided, you 
will get a sense of the development process for producing a large-
scale mobile learning system from beginning to end. However, 
you may also wish to hone in on a specific topic that interests you 
today, using the Contents and the Index to find what you are look-
ing for. We hope you enjoy the book and find it useful.

UNDERSTANDING 
MOBILE LEARNING
PART 1

C H A P T E R  1
Enterprise Mobile Learning
A Primer
Gary Woodill and Chad Udell
Although people have been learning while mobile for millennia, 
what we mean by “mobile learning” is the ability to move from 
place to place while using mobile devices to receive from and con-
tribute to a variety of digital information sources. While a large 
variety of lightweight devices can be used in mobile learning, the 
important part of this definition is that the learner is mobile and not 
confined to a specific location.
As a society, we’ve become much more mobile, both as indi-
viduals and as groups, than people who lived only a few decades 
ago. We are nomads, often on the move, but remaining connected 
to our friends, families, workplaces, and information sources. For 
many people, such as sales staff, field services workers, consul-
tants, transportation personnel, and high-level executives, being 
mobile is a major component of their work environments. For 
many other people as well, commuting to work is part of life and 
takes up a significant part of the day.
But, as we move about, most of us are equipped, often from 
our early teens now, with one or more mobile devices connected 
to a range of information and communication services. The abil-
ity to move about while remaining connected is the essence of 
mobile learning. This change has an impact on both the place 

8    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
and the timing for learning. It empowers learning outside of 
fixed places specifically designed for learning, such as classrooms 
and labs, and makes information for learning available any time 
it is needed. Full-scale adoption of mobile learning will have a 
profound impact on the structure of enterprise learning and 
development departments in ways that we are just beginning to 
understand.
Business Drivers of Mobile Learning
These are early days in the adoption of mobile learning within 
large enterprises. Some of the business drivers that are moving 
mobile learning forward in such organizations include:
•• The need for speedier training is evident. Because we live in a  
time of rapid technological change, there is often a need for 
more frequent training as new procedures, strategies, and 
technologies are adopted by companies.
•• Time available for training has been reduced. At the same time, 
hyper-competition and the demand for multitasking by  
workers has meant that there is less time available for training. 
Training often has to be done “on-the-fly” or outside work 
environments. Mobile learning offers one solution to this 
problem.
•• Mobile learning reinforces a major goal of enterprise learning and 
development departments. Enterprise learning is a bit of a  
misnomer. In reality, most enterprise training is actually meant 
to increase performance and has very little to do with what is 
traditionally thought of as acquiring new knowledge. Gaining 
knowledge and long-term retention of information is often a 
side-effect of corporate training; but make no mistake, if com-
panies could forego training employees and still maintain or 
increase performance, they would. Mobile allows resources 
in the learning and development departments to be spent on 
efforts to increase performance by having information ­available 
when needed, rather retaining knowledge for a long time.
•• The infrastructure for mobile learning is already in place. The wide-
spread deployment of mobile computing means that  
the infrastructure for mobile learning is usually in place, and 

enterprise mobile learning    9
most workers already carry a mobile device with them most  
of the time. While some companies want to issue standard,  
“company liable” smart phones or tablets to their employees, 
many organizations are taking advantage of the existing  
situation by using a “bring your own device” (BYOD) strategy.
•• Many workers are already mobile. For many jobs, the workforce 
is already “on the road,” meaning that it is often expensive 
to bring them into a central location for training. Still other 
workers don’t go into the workplace every day, but work from 
home or from other locations. Some are commuters who may 
be able to work while using public transportation to reach 
their physical workplaces. Finally, within a large building or 
campus, employees may move around a specific area as part  
of their jobs. All this means that, for many workers, mobile 
learning already fits with their lifestyle and work habits.
•• With globalization, mobile devices may be the best way to reach 
all employees. Global sourcing and global labor mean that 
­employees or customers who need training may be anywhere 
in the world. For some, a mobile smart phone or tablet may  
be the only computing device available.
In addition to presenting training materials, mobile learn-
ing can be used for performance support, research, and learning 
management. Mobile learning, when properly designed, can be  
described as “just in time, just enough, and just for me.” The  
capabilities of mobile learning extend well beyond the method-
ologies of traditional training and allow greater efficiency and 
effectiveness of the training and development function within an 
organization.
The Mobile Learning Ecosystem
Many components go into a successful mobile learning experi-
ence. Together, they can be seen as a “mobile learning ecosystem.” 
Components include a large variety of mobile devices with many 
features and capabilities, several types of content, a handful of dif-
ferent operating systems or platforms, a network of mobile commu-
nications providers with different standards, offerings, and price 
structures, a developing suite of tools for content creation, and  

10    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
a set of new concepts and uses for mobile learning that we are just 
beginning to understand.
Mobile devices come in many shapes and sizes and have many 
ways of connecting to and distributing information. Input devices 
include microphones, cameras, keypads, small keyboards, click-
able scroll wheels, mini joysticks, touch pads, touch screens, voice, 
Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, RFID, Near Field Communications, infrared, 
accelerometers, sensors, magnetic field detectors, and styluses. 
Output methods include text, sound, video, images, digital sig-
nals, LED lights, and various forms of 2D and 3D projection onto 
surfaces or directly into the eyeball. Work is underway on devices 
that stimulate the senses of smell and taste using a mobile device.
Mobile Learning Applications
Learning designers and developers have many choices for how to 
facilitate learning using mobile technologies. The specific tech-
niques that you choose to implement in your mobile learning 
design will depend on your learning theories, your experience 
at training or teaching, and the characteristics and needs of the 
learners you are trying to train. Mobile learning applications can 
be broken into five broad categories.
Content Transmission and Retrieval
Learning materials relevant to an employee can either be created 
by the training and development department and “pushed” to the 
learner, or can be retrieved by a user at “the point of need.” Because 
of the nature of mobile learning, it is best if learning materials are in 
the form of small “nuggets” of information, rather than large-scale 
productions or courses. For most workers, mobile learning is some-
thing that is usually done in small amounts, but several times during 
the day. Notifications can be used to alert employees to a required 
or important piece of information they need to consult.
Capturing Data
In contrast to e-learning, mobile phones and tablets are bidirec-
tional, allowing users to employ them as data-gathering and storage 
devices as they move about. An inquiry-based pedagogy makes sense 

enterprise mobile learning    11
for mobile learning and turns a mobile device into a research tool 
(see Chapter 24). First-person documentation activities can include 
maintenance of a learning portfolio, monitoring and trend tracking 
of local phenomena, and the creation of user-generated content.
Communicating and Interacting with Others
Because mobile devices can be networked, they are great for com-
municating, coordinating actions, and collaborating with others. 
Networking allows for texting, social media, voice communica-
tions, group games, simulations, experiences in virtual worlds, 
and real-time mentoring, as well.
Computing Algorithms
Mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets can also be 
thought of as computers in their own right. Many of these are 
more powerful than many desktop computers just five or ten 
years ago and, because of that, they can be programmed to do 
almost anything. This has spawned a mobile app industry that has 
exploded, with over two million separate pieces of software avail-
able in various app stores on the Internet. Thousands of apps now 
available can be used for mobile learning.
Contextual Inquiry
Not only can mobile devices retrieve information from databases, 
but they can also be used to interact with “smart” objects and/
or other mobile technology–connecting people in a person’s 
immediate environment. Additionally, the ability of many devices 
to detect a user’s location and orientation allows for new kinds 
of informational experiences, such as augmented reality and 
geofencing.
In addition to these five categories of mobile learning expe-
riences, mobile applications can also be used to manage learn-
ing activities in the classroom or in the field. Live information on 
emergencies and instructions on what to do in those situations 
can be conveyed to a group of dispersed users very quickly. And 
mobile extensions of more traditional learning management sys-
tems allow the tracking of mobile learning by existing learning 
and development software.

12    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Designing and Creating Mobile  
Learning Content
At the present time, no rapid authoring tools will easily allow 
a non-technical person to produce all of the above types of 
applications. At this early stage of the development of the field 
of mobile computing, it is usually necessary to use a combina-
tion of a designer and a software developer to produce a desired 
application or to use applications that have been built by others. 
Once you move beyond creating simple read-only content, you 
are entering a realm more akin to traditional software design and 
development than to e-learning or other instructional design 
and development paths.
There is a recommended process (see below) by which mobile 
learning content can be built. We start with understanding the 
Sample Process

enterprise mobile learning    13
business needs behind the desire to have mobile applications and 
content produced. Mobile learning creation involves several dif-
ferent design and development skill sets—producing a strategic 
business analysis of the need for mobile learning, understand-
ing mobile content strategy, managing a sound mobile learning 
design and development process, leading a solid technology and 
programming team, and project managing both the development 
and implementation of an outstanding mobile learning system. 
Unless you have such a team with these skills sets in-house, you will 
most likely need to outsource the development of mobile learning 
to a competent vendor with these skills.

The Seven Shifts  
in Enterprise Learning
Gary Woodill
Mobile learning has been involved in at least seven different shifts in 
enterprise learning in the past decade. While mobile computing is not 
the only factor causing these shifts, it is implicated in each one. Other 
factors include improvements and lower costs of computer technolo-
gies, the spread of computer networking, the rise of social media, the 
globalization of innovation, and the information explosion.
1.  A Shift in the Location of Learning
Although the 1980s saw a marked increase in the use of classrooms 
in training and development, especially through the establish-
ment of “corporate universities,” this trend has now reversed with 
the advent of mobile learning. While lots of classroom training 
still takes place, increasingly the use of smart phones and tablets 
to look up information “at the point of need” is taking over from 
classroom instruction. This is particularly true for employees who 
are already “on the road,” such as traveling sales staff, field ser-
vices workers, and those in various transportation industries.
2.  A Shift in Time
The development over the past fifty years of information and com-
munications technologies (ICT) has moved the production and 
C H A P T E R  2

16    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
consumption of learning materials from books and binders to 
a variety of online screens available from anywhere, at any time. 
Smart phones and tablets have accelerated this trend, as more and 
more materials are available in electronic formats on a user’s mobile 
device, greatly increasing the speed of access. Instead of waiting 
for knowledge to be published in print form, which can take up 
to several months to go through the processes of writing, editing, 
refereeing, and printing, learning materials can now be written 
and produced rapidly and sent out to the world within hours. In 
addition, the adoption of newer, more powerful and faster mobile 
devices has also accelerated. With the collection of “big data” and 
continuous monitoring by sensors and user input, new knowledge 
now can be produced in “real time,” while events are happening. 
As analytics and reporting matures in this space, we can expect that 
predictive analytics will allow us to respond immediately to learner 
needs for specific feedback and suggestions for what to do next.
3.  A Shift in Context
When learning in a classroom or from e-learning programs on 
a desktop, users are generally not “in context.” That is, they are 
not immersed in the environment or circumstances about which 
they are learning. With mobile learning, learners can be in the 
same context/environment about which they are learning or have 
questions. Because of this, mobile learning tends to be more rel-
evant and motivating than those forms of training and develop-
ment that take you out of context. Mobile learning particularly 
lends itself to inquiry-based learning, because it is able to answer 
users’ questions immediately while they are exploring a particular 
context. Context, time, location, and learner needs play a much 
bigger role for mobile learning than they did for previous e-learn-
ing applications.
4.  A Shift in the Amount of Information
There has been a huge explosion of data created, captured, and 
stored in the world in the past ten years. “Between the dawn of civ-
ilization through 2003, there was just five exabytes (or 500 million 
gigabytes) of information created,” Google CEO Eric Schmidt 
told an audience in 2010. “That much information is now created 

the seven shifts in enterprise learning     17
in two days, and the pace is increasing. People aren’t ready for the 
technology revolution that is going to happen to them,” he added 
(quoted in Kirkpatrick, 2010). While some critics have disputed 
the exact amounts of information created up to 2003 and since, 
there is no doubt that we are in the midst of a massive explosion 
of data, driven by the ease at which we can collect, replicate, and 
store it. Continuing on, Schmidt described the search engine’s 
role as becoming more of a “Serendipity Engine,” providing 
information to a user before it is even queried. Google Now is a 
first salvo in this sort of scenario. Personal agents like Siri on iOS 
devices are another approach to the problem of having too much 
information available for any one person to know.
This vast collection of data is now available to specially 
designed software that allows for “machine learning,” whereby 
computers turn large data sets into useful information and predic-
tions, available at a moment’s notice. Increasingly, mobile devices 
such as smart phones and tablets, are the windows into this new 
world and are being used in educational settings for “adaptive 
instruction.” The “semantic web” and the inclusion of contextual 
data for understanding information on a variety of networks is a 
rich area of research and development. The increasing ability for 
computers to parse and assign meaning to our written language 
will open many doors in this challenging area.
5.  A Shift in the Location of Information
The digital revolution has shifted the location of information from 
printed materials and analog recordings to a variety of digital for-
mats. Early computers (including the first personal computers in 
the 1970s) stored information on tape, then on local hard drives 
and servers. With the development of global networking, storage 
of information has now been transformed into “the cloud,” a met-
aphor for the vast “server farms” owned by large companies like 
Google, Microsoft, Rackspace, Apple, and Amazon, among others. 
This has the benefit of reducing costs for information storage to 
nearly zero, and for making information available anywhere, any 
time. Information that used to be stored locally on a company 
server is now administered and mined by large corporations and 
the government. This has implications for privacy, security, and sur-
veillance that we only now are beginning to understand.

18    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
6.  A Shift in Learning Experiences
As discussed in Chapter 15, the many unique “affordances” 
(Gibson, 1977) of mobile devices has resulted in the possibility of 
new kinds of learning experiences. Geolocation capabilities, inter-
nal sensors, text messaging, social networking, and miniaturiza-
tion of mobile computing have all resulted in new possibilities for 
mobile instructional design and performance support. Learning 
games using geospatial data, gesture recognition in simulations, 
supportive messages to people needing help, and collaborative 
learning opportunities are all real examples of how new affor-
dances are already being used in mobile learning activities. As 
new affordances of mobile computing are identified and/or com-
bined, other creative experiences will be developed for mobile 
learning.
7.  A Shift in Control
The digital revolution, including developments in mobile com-
puting, has resulted in a new set of powerful tools that can be used 
in new ways for enterprise learning. One issue that has not been 
settled is who is going to control the development and use of these 
new technologies. Is it going to be individuals, who then take con-
trol of their own learning? Is it going to be community control, 
whereby networks of collaborators are able to work together to 
accomplish their goals? Is it going to be educational institutions, 
which still retain the power to issue credentials for most profes-
sions? Or is it going to be corporations and/or governments, who 
are now collecting vast amounts of data on each of us, who will be 
able to analyze this data and turn it into information to influence 
their employees, other individuals, and communities? The answer 
to this question has not been determined yet, and the result may, 
in fact, be a balancing act of shared control among all four groups.
Although they may have had different starting points, the 
seven shifts in learning discussed above have all converged and 
are now evolving together. This has resulted in a complex situa-
tion for those in the learning and development industry, who must 
learn new skills and how to overcome new challenges brought on 
by these shifts.

The Disruptive Nature 
of Mobile Learning
John Feser
When we think of something or someone as being “disruptive,” 
our first reaction may be to paint a negative picture. It could be 
a child acting inappropriately in a public space or a winter storm 
that ices roads and forces an evening of cancellations. It could 
even be something as simple as a telephone ringing that ­interrupts 
our train of thought. Regardless of the image that comes to mind, 
disruptions tend to be things we want to minimize in our lives.
In technology circles, the term “disruptive” often has the oppo-
site connotation when put into practice. Think about some disrup-
tive technologies that have come about in the last several decades: the 
microprocessor, the microwave oven, cable television, the Internet. 
The introduction of these technologies all spawned entire industries 
around them and upset the traditional industries they displaced.
Disruptive is a term commonly used to describe mobile learning. 
Why is mobile learning considered disruptive? Is this type of disrup-
tion a good thing? Answering these questions requires, first, under-
standing what the term disruptive means in the context of mobile 
learning. Next is to determine how mobile learning fits into this defi-
nition, and, finally, we must investigate the implications for businesses 
and others looking to implement mobile learning. Once these three 
areas have been reviewed sufficiently, it is then possible to decide 
whether, and then how, mobile learning fits into an organization.

22    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
What Is Meant by Disruptive?
The World English Dictionary defines the word “disrupt” as “(v) to 
throw into turmoil or disorder.” While there could be some of this 
with mobile learning, this definition does not truly capture why 
mobile learning is called disruptive.
In 1997, Clayton Christensen published a well-known and 
popular book, The Innovator’s Dilemma: When New Technologies 
Cause Great Firms to Fail. In his book, Christensen coined the term 
disruptive technology, which he describes as:
First, disruptive products are simpler and cheaper; they generally 
promise lower margins, not greater profits. Second, disruptive tech-
nologies typically are first commercialized in emerging or insignif-
icant markets. And third, leading firms’ most profitable customers 
generally don’t want, and indeed initially can’t use, products based 
on disruptive technologies.
Here again is a definition that doesn’t really seem to fit. Mobile 
learning may be less expensive in many instances, but the under-
lying technology certainly is not simple nor is it simpler than cur-
rent learning technologies. Furthermore, mobile learning has 
significant implications for large and mature markets, just as it 
does for emerging and insignificant markets.
James Burke, who wrote and hosted the PBS series  
Connections, explains disruptions occurring from coincidental 
inventions, changes in regulations and society, exploding demand 
for new products, as well as growth in complementary technol-
ogies created through strange connections. Burke’s description 
seems to fit mobile learning better, but it is a combination of these 
three that may be the most appropriate way to explain disruption 
in the context of mobile learning. A more accurate description 
would be that:
A disruption is an interruption to the normal flow of an activ-
ity, thought, or ideal so significant that it requires a deliberate 
response to the interruption.
Of course, one response to a disruption is to ignore it alto-
gether, such a cell phone going off in a meeting, but that deci-
sion is always conscious and deliberate. This definition is very 

the disruptive nature of mobile learning    23
broad, very deep, and very pervasive, but it easily fits a number of 
technologies and events that have been commonly referred to as 
disruptive.
The rapid adoption of DVD technology in the early 2000s 
forced consumers to decide not only which device they would 
need to purchase for watching movies at home, but also which 
format they would invest in for the media itself. Then along comes 
streaming video like Netflix, and the disruption and upheaval in 
the market begins again.
With all of this in mind, mobile learning is disruptive in the 
sense that it significantly interrupts our approaches, ideas, and 
thoughts on how best to develop and deliver learning content.
How Is Mobile Learning Disruptive?
Mobile learning interrupts the normal flow of our activities, 
thoughts, and ideas in a number of ways, and each of these con-
tributes to mobile learning being disruptive.
Mobile devices are ubiquitous. The evidence is clear: mobile 
technology is becoming more and more pervasive in people’s daily 
lives. For many individuals, their cell phone is the first thing they 
look at in the morning and the last thing they check before going 
to bed. How often do we sit in a meeting and see people checking 
their email, sending a text message, or looking up additional infor-
mation related to the presentation or discussion at hand? The fact 
is, every day humans are becoming more and more dependent 
on mobile devices, to the point that they don’t even realize just 
how much they use them to learn. Take, for instance, turn-by-
turn navigation, whether it is using a dedicated device such as a 
Garmin or TomTom GPS receiver, or if it is the navigation system 
built directly into an Android device. When a destination is pro-
grammed in, there is an expectation that the device will show how 
to get to the location directly, quickly, and accurately. Whether it 
is a friend’s new home or somewhere we never plan to go again, 
there is still learning occurring in the sense of learning how to 
reach the destination, including any alternate routes that may be 
available. The point is, regardless of how much people realize it 
or how deliberate they are in their use, mobile devices are playing 
a big role in helping individuals learn and discover new things 
every day.

24    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Mobile learning is challenging traditional views of teaching. 
For hundreds of years, teaching has focused on the concept of 
“learn now, use later” or “learn now, just in case you might need it 
later.” These ideas, which have driven the design of many learning 
theories, have a strong emphasis on memorization and retention. 
For instance, many would agree on the importance of learning 
CPR, but unless you work in the medical field, this knowledge is 
something we likely will never have to use.
Mobile devices, however, support the notion of “need now, learn 
now.” Many of today’s automatic external defibrillators (AEDs), 
which are becoming more prevalent, especially in places like public 
buildings and larger companies, have voice synthesis built in that 
will actually walk you through the process of using the device and 
giving CPR. This is not to suggest that CPR training is no longer nec-
essary, but now the in-class instruction can focus more on proper 
technique and less on memorizing the exact cadence and timing 
of the breaths and compressions. In this way mobile computing is 
helping to shift teaching from face-to-face instruction to “perfor-
mance support.”
Mobile devices are enabling more self-directed learning. 
Most learning theory is based on the concept of an instructor 
teaching a student. The instructor determines the learning 
objectives, the curriculum, and the pedagogy to be used. The 
student is then the recipient of this information in the form of 
instruction. The instruction can happen in a classroom or on a 
computer in the form of e-learning. It doesn’t matter; someone 
other than the learner predetermines the learning content.
With mobile learning, instruction can be very personal and 
individual. Imagine two people in downtown Chicago standing in 
front of the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower). One may be 
very interested in the history and physical aspects of the skyscraper, 
when it was built, how tall it is, why the name was changed, and 
so forth. The other person may be interested in knowing how the 
building has been used, what corporations have had offices there, 
the cost to lease space, and the historical occupancy rate. By looking 
for the information they want on a mobile device, both individuals 
are learning what matters and is most relevant to them. Their learn-
ing is not being dictated by what someone else thinks is important.
Mobile devices are changing how and when information is 
accessed. Let’s say a parent is waiting to pick up her child from 

the disruptive nature of mobile learning    25
school. She hears a song on the radio and is really interested in 
the performing artist. Fifteen years ago, aside from hoping the 
DJ says the name of the song and the artist or waiting until she 
is home to call the radio station, this person may be out of luck. 
Today, with the Shazam app loaded on a smart phone, not only 
are the name and artist of the song available, but it is possible  
to instantly purchase the song or album, find tour information  
for the artist, read reviews, and find a whole host of additional 
information right from the app.
Carry this technology a little further and imagine someone 
heading to a business meeting two hours away. He suddenly hears 
a noise coming from the engine compartment of the car and is not 
sure whether it is serious enough to warrant stopping and having it 
looked at or whether to keep going in order to make it to the meet-
ing on time. As of early 2013, people can keep tabs on their cars 
with a remote monitoring device from Verizon. It’s only a matter 
of time or innovation before the Shazam for engine noises exists.
There is no question that mobile technology is taking the 
world by storm. For the past few years, mobile phones have held 
the distinction of being the most prolific electronic technology 
humans have ever adopted. With more than six billion mobile 
subscribers worldwide, smart phones continue to sell at an ever- 
increasing rate, resulting in a global society that is becoming more 
and more connected in many different ways. One of the most  
significant implications of this surge in connectedness is in how 
people access information and how they learn.
The Impact on Organizations
How should organizations and their HR and training depart-
ments react to the disruption caused by mobile learning? The 
high-level answer to this question is straightforward: keep an 
open mind and get smart. Mobile learning represents significant 
differences from the approaches used in traditional learning. 
These traditional approaches have been in place for many years 
and are an ingrained part of how training developers think and 
work. Helping organizations see the potential in mobile requires 
a change in how people view learning and a fundamental shift 
from the idea that the instructor is in control to one where the 
learner is in control. Unless training managers and developers 

26    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
understand this critical point and are willing to give up control, 
the power of mobile learning will never be fully realized.
Where should those interested in embracing mlearning spend 
their energies and resources? The answer lies in moving beyond 
your comfort zone and thinking differently. The pace of change 
today is not just filling people’s pockets, offices, and living rooms 
with new gadgets, tools, and toys, but changing how people think, 
learn, and interact. Understanding and embracing these sociolog-
ical and behavioral changes is every bit as important as the rapid 
improvements in technology. As companies look at how to incorpo-
rate mobile learning into their learning and development needs, 
the following ideas should be in the forefront of their thinking.
Significant Opportunities for Mobile Exist, But They Are 
Not Always Immediately Obvious
Organizations considering mobile learning must come to grips 
with the idea that mobile learning represents opportunities for 
learning and performance enhancement that previously did not 
exist. However, identifying these opportunities is not as straight-
forward as one might think. While there are always a number of 
situations for which benefits can be easily found, these are often 
too generic to be practical or too specific to apply to another orga-
nization’s needs. The reality is that successfully taking advantage 
of a disruptive technology like mobile learning is an iterative proc­
ess requiring both an understanding of the technology and, at 
the same time, being in tune with the business needs of the orga-
nization. By focusing solely on the technology, companies risk a 
situation in which they have a “solution looking for a problem.” 
On the other hand, ignoring the technology until “someone else 
figures it out” is not the best option either. The most effective 
answer is recognizing that the best opportunities will not present 
themselves all at once, but will materialize over time as an organi-
zation’s experience with mlearning grows.
As an example, digital video recorders (DVRs) represented 
a disruptive technology to the hugely popular videocassette 
recorder (VCR). When DVRs first appeared on the market, a 
number of features and benefits gave them an advantage over 
VCRs, but they were largely seen as an upgraded technology to 
what already existed. Then along came TiVo, a company that  

the disruptive nature of mobile learning    27
was creative and identified numerous opportunities for providing 
benefits to its customers. Features such as the ability to recom-
mend shows similar to those a user normally records, the ability 
to request a program be recorded remotely from the Internet, 
the ability to transfer recorded shows to a mobile device, and the 
ability to automatically extend the recording time of live television 
shows are all examples of ideas resulting from this disruptive tech-
nology, but they did not all come at the same time.
HR and Training Departments Must Change How They 
View and Create Learning
Mobile devices are changing traditional views of learning from a 
directed experience defined by the person creating the training, 
to a self-directed experience where the learner is in control. This 
idea will have a profound impact on the role of HR and training 
departments in most organizations. In the past, these departments 
have had to focus on the content that had to be learned: curricula, 
courses, job aids, and so forth. With mobile learning, the focus 
is not just simply on what has to be learned. Now, consideration 
must be given to factors such as when the information will be most 
useful, how to provide easy access to information, and presenting 
content in a way that matches the context of the situation in which 
learning is needed. Essentially, trainers must move from the idea 
of telling people what they need to know to helping them learn 
what they want to know.
A related impact is the working relationship between learn-
ing developers and those departments that will benefit from the 
learning. Much of mobile learning is about delivering informa-
tion at the moment of need, in the context of the situation, and in 
bite-size chunks. As a result, training developers will be forced to 
work more closely and collaboratively with those groups who are 
requesting that learning materials be developed. In many ways, 
traditional forms of training, where information is pushed to the 
learner, are much simpler to develop because there are only two 
key variables: the audience and the content. With mobile learn-
ing, these two variables still exist, but now there is a third variable: 
context. Adding this third variable requires a much more thor-
ough understanding of the situation in order for effective learn-
ing to take place. As a result, a much tighter working relationship 

28    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
between learning development and other parts of the organiza-
tion must be developed.
Organizations Must Recognize the New Efficiencies 
and Limitations Associated with Accessing and Sharing 
Information
Vast improvements and changes in how people communicate with 
each other are having a profound impact on how learning hap-
pens. Those responsible for delivering training must find ways to 
leverage these improvements. Traditionally, learning content has 
been static; once delivered it would not change. Content devel-
opers could fix on a format, a delivery method, and, to a certain 
extent, on the environment and be assured that anyone accessing 
that content would receive it in the way in which it was designed. 
With mobile technology and many more ways to access informa-
tion, learning content providers must plan for myriad ways that 
information can be accessed and passed along.
An obvious example is the various screen sizes and technolo-
gies associated with mobile devices. For instance, most PDF docu-
ments look great on an iPad, are very difficult to read on a mobile 
phone, and only show up in monochrome on a Kindle. The de 
facto standard for publishing documents on a computer is not 
nearly as useful on many mobile devices in their various default 
presentation formats. On the flip side, better connectivity between 
people can enhance learning in ways that were never before pos-
sible. Think about a doctor looking at an MRI trying to diagnose 
a patient’s condition. Instead of trying to research the situation in 
books or online, the image can be sent to a colleague across the 
globe who can provide advice and suggestions simply by looking 
at an image on her phone or tablet.
Conclusion
Mobile devices are having an enormous impact, interrupting long-
held approaches to how people learn, what they learn, and when 
they learn. This disruption is causing many different reactions.
The disruptive nature of mobile learning provides tremen-
dous opportunities for organizations willing to embrace this new 
method of providing information and performance support.

But make no mistake: mobile learning is disruptive, and to take 
advantage of this disruption, a proactive response is required. By 
stepping outside the box of traditional instructor-led training and 
e-learning, HR and training departments can provide tremendous 
resources to employees. But doing so will require a commitment 
to thinking differently and trying new ideas.

Why Executives Should Care 
About Mobile Learning
John Feser
The world is a busy place, and people’s time continues to become 
more and more a scarce resource. This is especially true for corpo-
rate executives, who are often presented with numerous opportu-
nities that require assessment and problems that require fixes. In 
many cases, they spend a significant amount of time in meetings 
being inundated with mounds of information and data that they 
must sift through in order to make sound decisions. With all that 
is on their plates and all the issues they have to deal with, why 
would or should corporate leaders care about mobile learning? 
Here are ten reasons:
	 1.	 With mobile devices, your employees always have their ­learning 
tools/devices with them. Mobile phones are ­ubiquitous and 
­pervasive in today’s society. Why not take advantage of 
devices ­employees have with them and use all the time? In 
many cases, they have paid for the devices themselves, and 
all you might have to do is help to subsidize a better data 
plan. Concerned that everyone has a different device and 
is on a different platform? Fair enough, but there are many 
ways to overcome this limitation, most not as complicated as 
you might think.

32    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
	 2.	 Mobile is global. With over six billion subscribers, no other 
technology is more accessible around the globe than mobile 
devices. For a company that has a distributed or multinational 
workforce, learning materials and activities can easily be  
distributed using mobile technology. Even in third-world 
countries, where running water and electricity might be 
scarce, mobile infrastructures are growing at an amazing rate.
	 3.	 Performance and productivity improvements are a fact of  
life. As trite as it might sound, a key component of ongoing 
business success is finding ways to do more with less. Putting 
the right information in people’s hands by making that  
information available when they need it is an important  
component of mobile learning. Identify where the informa-
tion gaps are for your employees, especially when they are on 
the go, and then find ways to fill those gaps through mobile 
content delivery. Make a list of the main inefficiencies you 
are dealing with in your organization today, and you will most 
likely discover that the lack of easy access to information is a 
leading contributor to many of those inefficiencies.
	 4.	 The volume of information your employees need to know is 
­increasing at an incredible rate. Take a step back for a moment 
and think what most people had to know fifty years ago in 
order to be effective versus what they need to know today. 
Whether it is knowing about more tools (Excel, PowerPoint, 
Word, Access, etc.), expanding product lines with addi-
tional features, or understanding 401(k) investment options 
compared with company pension plans from the 1960s and 
1970s, it is undeniable that most people must remember, 
understand, and utilize much more information today than 
ever before. Any time you can reduce the amount of infor-
mation or cognitive load people have to remember by mak-
ing it readily available elsewhere, you are going to realize 
benefits through increased accuracy and efficiency.
	 5.	 Mobile learning is contextual. Much of the time spent in 
instructor-led training (ILT) or in front of computers doing 
e-learning can be replaced by “learning while working.” 
Classrooms and e-learning must create an imagined con-
text for the information being taught, whereas, with mobile 
devices, learning occurs when a real context presents itself. 

why executives should care about mobile learning    33
Think about the difference between trying to create a “what 
if” scenario for your children as opposed to taking advantage 
of a “teachable moment.” For a concrete example, consider 
showing your child a video on how to ride a bike versus actu-
ally being by their sides. I think that, as parents, we would 
agree that the teachable moments are much more effective. 
Workplace learning is no different.
	 6.	 Mobile learning is cost-effective. Considering the time employees 
spend participating in instructor-led training or e-learning, 
it is apparent that development costs are only one of the 
expenses that result from these forms of learning. That 
doesn’t make these forms of instruction bad, but when the 
costs of delivering training are factored in, mobile learning 
can have a real advantage. In addition, the costs to develop 
mobile learning rarely exceed more traditional forms of 
training, and in some cases can be much less.
	 7.	 Mobile learning is reusable. Think about how much material 
from a classroom training session is never used again by the 
people attending the training. Sure, there are often hand-
outs or a binder full of information. But are those handouts 
and binders really designed for ongoing use and reference? 
In some cases, the answer is yes, especially if the instructional 
designer has paid close attention to creating solid reference 
materials. But the accessibility of information in mobile 
learning makes creating training that has a life beyond initial 
use both practical and beneficial.
	 8.	 Mobile learning has adaptability and speed. With properly 
designed mobile learning, new or updated information  
can reach your audience almost instantly. Imagine an SMS 
text message that alerts your sales force that new product 
information has been released. The next time they log  
onto the mobile web or native app that contains product 
information, the new information is downloaded and is avail-
able to the user. When appropriate, content can be updated 
behind the scenes with no action required by the learner.
	 9.	 Mobile devices allow improved data capture. We tend to think 
about training and learning in terms of a traditional  
teacher-student model where instructional material is pre-
pared ahead of time and then shared with or communicated 

34    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
to learners. But mobile devices can be an excellent way to  
generate content and share information gathered or 
learned. There are many examples of this. For instance, a 
camera phone can easily be used at a job site to send infor-
mation about a problem to a colleague. Or, using applica-
tions like Twitter, information can quickly be shared with a 
group. In one example, an insurance company was looking 
to improve their agent recruiting efforts through the use 
of mobile devices. By providing recruiters an easy way to 
capture information about prospects and recruiting efforts, 
management hoped to gain valuable information about 
which techniques and locations were most successful  
and which needed to be refined.
	10.	 Mobile learning is convenient. Unlike PCs that have to be  
turned on and booted up, or classroom training that must be 
scheduled, mobile learning takes advantage of devices that are 
usually on, within reach, and in most cases connected to the 
mobile network. The convenience factor allows for creating 
learning content that is more likely to be used when needed.
This is not an exhaustive list, of course, but it should serve to 
illustrate that mobile learning is not a passing fad or trend that 
can be easily dismissed or ignored. For executives who are seri-
ous about leveraging opportunities as they present themselves, 
mlearning certainly deserves a closer look.

mLearning Is Not e-Learning 
on a Mobile Device
John Feser
With the proliferation of mobile devices and the increasing capa-
bilities of today’s smart phones, mobile learning (or mlearning), 
has been getting a lot of press. Given the similarity between the 
terms e-learning and mlearning, one might be tempted to assume 
that mlearning is little more than e-learning on a mobile device. 
This assumption could not be further from the truth.
Clearly, we don’t use our cell phones, e-readers, and tablet 
computers in the same way we use our desktop or laptop com-
puters, or even their technological predecessors, books, CDs, or 
tape players. So it follows that the type of learning that is appro-
priate on a mobile device is very different from what we do at our 
desks. In fact, the differences between mlearning and e-learning 
are at least as great as those between e-learning and instructor-led 
training. The differences between those two deployment paths 
are so significant that it requires a completely different approach 
to instructional design, graphic and user experience design, 
and information presentation. So what makes mlearning so dif-
ferent from e-learning, and why is mlearning such an important 
development?
Understanding the differences between e-learning and 
mlearning begins with first defining mlearning. While there are 

36    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
many opinions and ideas surrounding this topic, when our com-
pany first started in 2010, we defined mobile learning as:
“. . . the use of mobile technology to aid in the learning, refer-
ence, or exploration of information useful to an individual at that 
moment or in a specific use context.”
At that time, we talked about cell phones being ubiquitous 
and pervasive in society, but April 2010 was the same month that 
the Apple iPad first went on sale. The explosion of tablet devices 
and the miniaturization of laptop computers over the past three 
years have greatly blurred what we typically think of as “mobile 
technology.” With wearable technology such as fitness bands and 
Google Glass, this blurring has only increased. We are now every 
bit as mobile in our homes and offices (check out the number of 
mobile devices in any conference room meeting) as we are out-
side of them.
How does this affect our definition of mobile learning? The 
biggest change is that it is not the technology or device that puts 
the “mobile” in mobile learning, but the combination of learners 
themselves and the approach to learning. As a result, the peda-
gogy is completely different.
What makes mobile learning different from other delivery 
channels for learning content is that it can happen at any time, 
anywhere, and in ways that are vastly different from what can be 
achieved in a classroom or traditional e-learning, in which a single 
learner sits and interacts with a teacher or computer.
Mobile learning is able to combine the best aspects of 
self-teaching with group learning (as in a classroom setting), with 
the technological aspects and advantages of e-learning, and more. 
The combination of these areas makes mlearning both unique 
and distinct.
Initially, we saw that the primary differences between mlearn-
ing and e-learning fell into four main categories: timing, infor-
mation access, context, and assessment. With hindsight and 
experience, we have added three more categories to the differ-
ences between mobile learning and e-learning. The new catego-
ries are performance support, user-generated content, and design 
for the unique affordances of mobile technologies. Let’s briefly 
look at each of these seven categories in turn.

MLEARNING IS NOT E-LEARNING ON A MOBILE DEVICE  37
Timing
The first major difference between e-learning and mlearning  
is the time when learning is expected to take place and the antici-
pated duration of the learning session. Most e-learning is designed 
for the learner to sit at a computer and progress through a spec-
ified amount of material for a period of time. The length of time 
required to complete a particular e-learning module varies, but 
generally the duration ranges anywhere from fifteen or twenty 
minutes to two hours. Because the instruction is designed to run 
on a desktop or laptop computer, a specific time is usually chosen 
to complete the module. Usually, this seems to be as close to the 
deadline for compliance as possible.
But mlearning, by its very nature, is untethered and can be done 
any time and anywhere, at the time of need. In addition, the small 
screen sizes of today’s mobile devices mean individual interaction 
sessions and, by extension, learning sessions, are much shorter in 
duration. Individuals don’t want to spend an hour staring at their 
phones just to complete preselected learning objectives. Instead, 
mobile learning is ideal for conveying smaller chunks of informa-
tion that can be absorbed while waiting for the bus, standing in 
line at the grocery store, or located on or around a job site. These 
chunks are chosen by the learners when they need them.
An example of this type of training is a quick reference guide. 
Imagine a new salesperson who has just completed her company’s 
online sales training course. The course was comprehensive and 
covered a lot of material, including the company’s custom sales 
process. Now she is on her first sales call. Arriving fifteen minutes 
early, she pulls out her smart phone and reviews a checklist of the 
five key elements of a successful sales call. Seeing that the number 
one element is to know the name and title of the person she is 
calling on, she quickly checks her notes and reviews the informa-
tion about her sales contact. This sort of just-in-time experience 
exhibits the value in making your learning content mobile.
Information Access
When taking an e-learning course on a topic, such as a sales train-
ing or a new product introduction, two key learning objectives 
are comprehension and retention. Because the information being 

38    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
learned will be applied at a later time, it is critical that the mate-
rial be understood and remembered until it is needed—what we 
might call “just-in-case learning.” Mobile learning, on the other 
hand, is more about accessing information at the moment it is 
needed. This implies that successful mlearning is more about easy 
and convenient access to information and less about committing 
information to memory.
Take healthy eating as an example. A lesson on the benefits of 
healthy eating would make an excellent e-learning topic due to the 
amount of information and the level of compression necessary to 
convey the key points. This type of learning would most likely not 
be appropriate for a mobile device. On the other hand, learning 
whether the Caesar salad or a bowl of black bean soup has more 
calories at a local fast-food restaurant via a simplified interface tai-
lored for the device is an ideal application for mobile learning.
Context
There is no doubt that mobile devices are being used for tasks that 
extend far beyond talking on the phone and sending text messages. 
The capabilities of these devices extend across a wide spectrum 
from geolocation to photography to Internet access. As a result, 
our context drives how we use our mobile devices. If it is lunchtime 
and we are in an unfamiliar city, we may use a mobile application or 
the Internet to find a suitable place to eat or relax at a park.
Context is one of the key areas in which mlearning is distin-
guished from e-learning. With e-learning, as with instructor-led 
sessions, it is critically important to establish the context so that 
the learner understands the importance of the subject matter. For 
instance, take an e-learning module about the importance of per-
forming a safety check before using a piece of equipment. You 
would most likely start the instruction with a discussion of why 
safety checks are important and, specifically, how they relate to 
the particular piece of equipment being discussed. Once the con-
text has been established, information on the actual safety check 
process can be presented.
With mlearning, however, the context has already been estab-
lished. For example, the defense company Lockheed Martin 
has recently developed an iPhone app that includes a full pre-
flight checklist for the C-130 Hercules Transport plane. The app 

MLEARNING IS NOT E-LEARNING ON A MOBILE DEVICE  39
contains a rotatable, zoomable image of the plane, as well as a 
visual step-by-step guide to each task required prior to flight. The 
idea is that a visual checklist is easier to use and interpret than 
a written document. When you add in the ability to clearly see 
close-ups or levels of detail that simply wouldn’t be possible in a 
traditional checklist, the value in leveraging the context of being 
next to the item you are inspecting or using becomes obvious.
Assessment
With e-learning, the gap between when learning occurs and when it 
is applied in practice can be significant, especially when compared 
to mobile learning. As a result, the methods of assessment are very 
different for the two learning methods. While Donald Kirkpatrick’s 
four levels of learning evaluation are applicable to both e-learning 
and mlearning, the approach to evaluation is different.
When assessing an e-learning module, it is relatively easy, 
through a series of questions, to determine success at the first two 
stages in Kirkpatrick’s levels of training evaluation (Kirkpatrick & 
Kirkpatrick, 2006): Level 1–Learner Reaction (what the learner felt 
about the training) and Level 2–Learning (the resulting increase 
in knowledge or capacity). However, with Level 3–Behavior and 
Level 4–Results, it becomes much harder to assess the impact of 
e-learning. This is not to say that behavior and results are, in and 
of themselves, hard to measure. But so many other factors can 
influence a person’s behavior or an organization’s results that it is 
difficult to tie these changes specifically to e-learning.
The time span between when mobile learning actually occurs 
and the application of that learning is usually very short; often it 
is immediate. As a result, it is much easier to assess mlearning’s 
impact on both an individual’s behavior and the ensuing business 
results. In addition, because mlearning is less about comprehen-
sion and retention and more about easy access to the right infor-
mation, Level 1 and Level 2 assessments are less important if the 
behaviors and results are appropriately changing.
Performance Support
The accessibility of mobile devices has not only decreased the need 
for rote memorization, but has increased our ability to capture 

40    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
and share information. This is huge when it comes to on-the-job 
performance support.
Whether it is having access to the latest information, such as a 
UPS or FedEx driver knowing the latest traffic information on his 
route, a doctor being able to quickly access a formulary to deter-
mine drug contraindications, or a company’s sales force making  
real-time updates into a CRM system aided by inline help and per-
formance support aids, people are now able to be more productive 
at work. This is a result of their ability to find and communicate 
information that helps them do their jobs. Because communicating 
valuable and useful information is the basis of all learning, perfor-
mance support clearly falls into the space of mobile learning.
User-Generated Content
Traditional e-learning is primarily unidirectional: a person sits at 
a computer and receives the information that was placed in the 
course module. In most e-learning, there is little or no feedback 
from one learner that can be shared with others, except for the 
occasional “smiley” that accompanies the course. This is weak 
feedback, given that it is basically communication to the course 
authors and doesn’t really contribute to the learning process. 
However, the social and collaborative nature of mobile devices 
changes all of this with mobile learning.
Consider the State Farm Driver Feedback app as an example 
of the ability for people to share their personal experiences with 
others. It provides a means for people in a common situation to 
connect and learn from each other. Imagine an entire high school 
driver’s education class using the app to improve their driving and 
then sharing their experiences. This is learning occurring, being 
shared, and affecting behavior—jumping from Kirkpatrick’s 
Level 1 or perhaps 2 to Level 3 in a very real and measurable way. 
The assessment occurs, but in a very different way than the one to 
which you may be accustomed.
The Unique Affordances of Mobile
Many of the mobile learning enhancements over previous learn-
ing tools have been made possible by technologies that simply 
haven’t been available or practical in classroom and e-learning.

MLEARNING IS NOT E-LEARNING ON A MOBILE DEVICE  41
Features such as geolocation, cameras, accelerometers, and 
other sensors turn our mobile devices into multi-purpose tools 
(can the Star Trek Tricorder be far off?). But more than that, 
these devices are also computers that can be programmed and, in 
turn, help program us for better performance.
Consider the State Farm’s Driver Feedback app. This tool uses 
the sensors in an iPhone to assess how a person is driving. It records 
how fast the car accelerates, corners, and brakes—all useful infor-
mation for helping someone become a better driver. While an 
e-learning module can certainly teach someone about the impor-
tance of not accelerating or taking a corner too quickly, mlearning 
can actually help someone recognize he or she is doing it!
Different Doesn’t Necessarily Mean Better
The differences between mlearning and e-learning may suggest 
that one learning approach is better than the other. Each can be 
appropriate in different situations. For instance, no one would 
want a cardiologist to need a refresher on the different valves of 
the heart prior to doing surgery. But you might feel a little bit 
more comfortable if your doctor pulled out her iPhone to con-
firm all the side-effects of a new blood thinning medication that 
had just been developed while she was about to prescribe a new 
course of treatments for you.
Similarly, an e-learning module on the history of Chicago may be 
both interesting and educational. The depth of content that could 
be revealed might require multiple viewings, with each one bring-
ing forth myriad fascinating details. But a walking tour of Chicago 
that uses the GPS feature of your phone to point out and explain 
important landmarks based on your current location is much more 
engaging than learning about them at home sitting at your desk.
The point is that the capabilities and features of today’s mobile 
devices are now allowing us to create entirely new ways of learn-
ing than were previously possible. When you start thinking about 
your phone or other mobile device from this perspective, you’ll 
be amazed at the creative ideas that will start to flow and the many 
ways to enhance the learning process. The key in transitioning 
the learning objectives and content lies in your ability to assess the  
learners’ goals and understand their context and the delivery 
methods you have available to you as the learning creator.

42    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Conclusion
Mobile learning certainly is not a replacement for instructor-led 
learning or e-learning. Both still have their place. Furthermore, 
there may be many legitimate reasons for making most, if not all, 
of your e-learning content accessible on mobile devices.
But it has become clearer as time has progressed that the 
mere act of publishing e-learning on a mobile device is not mobile 
learning. Genuine, newly conceived mobile learning has its own 
unique qualities, characteristics, and pedagogy.
It’s not a case of trying to teach an old dog a new trick, but an 
entirely different animal—one that can often teach tricks to itself 
with just a little push.

STRATEGIC 
THINKING ABOUT 
MOBILE LEARNING
PART 2

C H A P T E R  6
The Six Ps of Mobile Learning 
Strategy
Chad Udell
Most of the questions about mobile learning I have answered over 
the past few years fall under one of the categories in a group I like 
to call the “Six Ps”: Platforms, Policies, Procurement, Provisioning, 
Publishing, and Procedures. In this chapter, I present these six 
categories and some thoughts about how they fit into an effective 
mobile technology strategy.
Choose the Most Appropriate Mobile Platform
The first category, platforms, sounds like a simple one. Android, 
iOS, BlackBerry, Windows 8—pick a platform and go with it. But 
it isn’t that simple. Perhaps the CEO has an iPad that she loves 
and now wants the entire company to use them. Maybe there is 
an existing installation of BlackBerry Enterprise Server that the 
IT department has already paid for and insists on sticking with. 
Or maybe the organization has a huge investment in Samsung 
products and can buy new phones and tablets at a huge discount. 
Everybody has an opinion, and sometimes the strongest voices 
come without the proper research. Be careful not to rush into 
a specific platform without careful consideration and strong evi-
dence for what is most appropriate for your enterprise.

46    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Another concern in choosing a mobile platform is deciding 
whether to embrace or reject the backdoor introduction of mobile 
devices by users adding their personal smart phones or tablets to 
the network. This trend, known as Bring Your Own Device or BYOD 
for short, is changing the way business technology services and 
solutions are conceived, designed, developed, and delivered. If you 
ignore this, you run the risk of creating a de facto policy of allowing 
any device onto the network, which creates a possible security risk 
and support headaches for your IT staff. Establishing an official 
mobile platform reduces that risk. It will also help determine your 
policies on accepting outside devices into your organization.
The biggest question that must be answered is whether it is 
even possible to settle on a single platform or whether you will 
be supporting more than one. That will change how you answer 
the questions that come when discussing the rest of the “Ps.” For 
a small company, it might be easier to say that you only have the 
resources to support Android devices or Apple’s iOS, but not both. 
Perhaps a large company has the resources to purchase and deploy 
iPads to every mobile user in the organization. Then it is possible 
to plan a single platform strategy. On the other hand, you may 
need to support contract employees who use different platforms, 
or you may want to be able to handle any mobile platform on the 
market. In that case, your future plans for provisioning devices, 
developing apps, and supporting the devices are entirely differ-
ent from a single platform strategy. But be mindful of the conse-
quences of supporting multiple platforms—it complicates things.
With the increasing number of tablets on the market, you also 
have to decide how that decision affects your planning. Is it pos-
sible to create a single mobile strategy for smart phones and tab-
lets, or does it require separate rules for each type of device? Just 
as developers have found that many apps don’t scale up from a 
phone to a tablet, your mobile strategy might not either.
It also is important to take the future of any chosen platform 
into consideration. Worldwide, the Android operating system is far 
ahead in terms of sales. The market for all mobile devices is quite 
dynamic and can change radically in just a couple of years. Choosing 
an appropriate platform means one that is more likely to be around 
in the future. There will also be far more apps and accessories devel-
oped for a platform with a large market share. The larger a mobile 
ecosystem is, the more useful it can be for your organization.

THE SIX Ps OF MOBILE LEARNING STRATEGY    47
So what is the best strategy in terms of choosing a mobile plat-
form? There isn’t a single correct answer to that question. The best 
response is to gather information throughout the organization. 
What is the reason for using mobile devices and deploying mobile 
learning? What devices fit into the enterprise infrastructure? What 
will the total cost of ownership (TCO) be for the mobile platforms? 
Who are the developers? Who and where are the end-users? How 
will you manage the devices and apps? Answering these questions 
requires talking to your IT staff, developers, and users to obtain 
an accurate idea of what will work best. Doing the proper research 
and planning up-front is essential to choosing the platform that 
will work best for your organization.
Implement Proper Procurement
The next important “P” is procurement. In some ways, this is a 
simple topic, but it is worthy of thoughtful consideration because 
it can be puzzling at times as well. Each of these steps is an inter-
locking part of the mobile strategy and influences the choices you 
have to make in the other areas.
When you hear procurement, you probably are thinking 
that it just means an end-user makes choices and then goes out 
and acts on those choices, right? Sure, those are the basics, but 
different factors can always affect those choices. If, back in the 
platform stage, your organization decided to adopt a single, stan-
dard mobile platform, this can be an easy step. This follows the 
traditional, familiar model of standardizing on a single software 
package or hardware vendor, which is why it is often recom-
mended in mobile strategy plans. Several variables are similar 
when purchasing mobile devices. For instance, what type of orga-
nization are you buying for? Most educational institutions have 
separate channels to go through. Apple has many schools and 
colleges listed in their online store. Many large vendors have a 
GSA-approved channel for government organizations, too. Keep 
in mind that there are also volume enterprise programs to con-
sider, if you are making a substantial purchase. There may be a 
process to request a quote and a possibility to negotiate on the 
price. It could be time-consuming, but it really is no different 
from the process of purchasing any other technology hardware 
for the organization.

48    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
You need to consider whether you have to purchase smart 
phones and service. If so, you will need to work with one of the 
wireless carriers. This adds the issue of negotiating for the service 
rates, and possibly a service level agreement (SLA) or guarantee 
policy. If the device or platform selected for your organization 
is exclusive to one carrier, you may have less negotiating power. 
Initially, if you wanted iOS, AT&T was the only carrier in the United 
States with the iPhone. There was no leverage for the consumer in 
comparing multiple vendors (and when it comes to Apple devices, 
there still really isn’t: one manufacturer, one price). Or perhaps 
your organization is locked into a contract with a carrier already. 
In that case, you may be limited to the smart phones available on 
that provider’s network. If your organization has chosen a plat-
form that is not available with that carrier, it would be necessary to 
negotiate an early termination fee (ETF) to break that contract. 
Depending on how many devices are under the contract, it could 
add a large expense for your organization to change carriers.
If your organization has chosen to support multiple mobile 
platforms, the issues around vendors and carriers are multiplied. 
Also, with exclusive devices being tied to specific carriers due 
to hardware availability, international trade laws, or contractual 
restrictions, the actual devices to choose from may be restricted.
Much more common today is for a company to have a bring 
your own device (BYOD) policy. Rather than the company sup-
plying a smart phone or tablet for everyone in the organization, 
employees have the choice to use their personal devices within the 
organization. More companies are choosing to support multiple 
platforms, and a BYOD policy allows an organization to imple-
ment this at a lower cost. Some policy issues, such as creating a 
list of supported devices that will be allowed on the company net-
work, determining who is responsible for the cost of data plans, 
and approval for applications, must be determined before imple-
menting a BYOD policy. Once you have chosen your platform and 
devices, you will have to consider the management policies for your 
mobile devices. Using one of the several mobile device manage-
ment (MDM) products and/or mobile applications management 
(MAM) products that supports multiple platforms can be a good 
way to handle your mobile management strategy. Once again, 
this shows that these are all pieces of the same puzzle. Your poli-
cies will determine what you want to use for device management, 

THE SIX Ps OF MOBILE LEARNING STRATEGY    49
based on the features offered in the MDM and MAM products on 
the market. Your organization will have to determine the delivery 
method that works best: software as a service (SaaS), software and 
data installed on local servers, or appliance installations (installed 
in your mobile devices). While procurement can seemingly be a 
simple part of your mobile learning plan, it illustrates how each 
part is woven into the others. Each subsequent decision in the 
development of a mobile technology strategy builds on the last. 
Without vision, perseverance, and documentation it will be dif-
ficult to achieve success, no matter how simple the procurement 
step seems.
Adopt Sound Policies
Policies are the third P to consider in your strategy. Remember 
that these pieces all work together to help build your strategy, and 
the choices made in one area influence the others.
Some parts of a mobile strategy are similar to traditional tech-
nology policies in your organization. For example, the University 
Information Technologies department at Villanova University has 
a mobile device/PDA policy that covers the purchase, deployment, 
and support guidelines for mobile devices. The initial section of 
this policy states that users are expected to follow the existing 
Acceptable Use and Network Security policies. Because mobile 
devices are accessing your organization’s network the same as any 
other computing device, it is important that you make your users 
aware that the same policies apply for those devices as well.
In some ways, certain parts of a mobile policy are actually deter-
mined before you reach this point in your planning. By your choos-
ing a mobile platform (or multiple platforms), a policy for what 
devices can be used on your network was established. The pro-
curement method that was selected helps determine the policy on 
how those devices can be provided. One additional piece that may 
need to be added to your organization’s policy is whether you have  
elected to allow a bring your own device (BYOD) plan. In this  
situation, there will likely be policy differences between company- 
supplied devices and user-owned devices. Some recommenda-
tions for creating user-owned device policies include limiting what 
devices will be allowed, requiring management rules to be applied to 
user-owned devices, and limiting support offerings to those devices.

50    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
At the root of your organization’s mobile policy is a decision 
on what information can and will be on mobile devices used for 
company business and how securely that information needs to 
be protected. Because mobile devices, by their very nature, can 
leave the physical location and network connections that you have 
secured, they pose a significant risk of your information being lost 
or stolen. In your organization’s policies, you will have to decide 
what information is allowed on mobile devices, and furthermore, 
how that data should be protected. Do you require devices with 
encrypted file systems to protect the data at all times? What about 
during transfer of the data? In order to protect the data, you may 
define a policy that requires users to use an encrypted data net-
work at all times. This can range from requiring WPA-secured 
wireless connections to using secured virtual private network 
(VPN) connections any time a device is used while not connected 
to the company network. Beyond these more apparent security 
policies, additional technologies, such as configuration profiles, 
SAML authentication, or various other domain authentication 
practices should be considered as part of the overall mobile tech-
nology policy you are crafting.
Some policies also must be considered for legal reasons. One 
issue that has occurred involves hourly or non-exempt employ-
ees using personal mobile devices to access their email. In a 
well-known case, one employee claimed and was paid for eight 
hundred hours of overtime in four months for viewing and reply-
ing to emails outside of business hours. Another issue with mobile 
devices involves distracted driving laws. Setting aside the obvious 
safety risks involved, there have been cases when the company 
that provided the phones was found liable in accidents involving 
their employees. Some state laws banning the use of cell phones 
while driving explicitly state that an employer can still be held 
responsible for an employee who is negligent. As a side note, my 
company does work with a couple of organizations that have actu-
ally made mobile device usage while driving a terminable offense. 
Because of these types of issues, it is crucial that your organization 
set policies for issues with potential legal implications.
Another part of your planning should involve your organiza-
tion’s mobile support policy. It is not enough to simply provide a 
list of approved devices; you will also need to determine what apps 
are supported, who will service issues with supported devices, and 

THE SIX Ps OF MOBILE LEARNING STRATEGY    51
replacement procedures when devices are lost or stolen. When 
phones are involved, there are also issues to consider in dealing 
with service providers. If a phone needs to be replaced, a new 
device may have to be assigned and the phone number will have 
to be transferred to maintain usage. There should be a policy for 
replacement and upgrading of devices as well. New devices come 
out faster than ever, and your organization must have a plan for 
moving to newer devices, including how to transfer applications 
and data to these new devices.
If you allow users to bring in their own devices with a BYOD 
policy, your organization will have to determine how much sup-
port to provide for user-owned devices. It may be as simple as stat-
ing that support personnel will provide a best-effort attempt, but 
that results are not guaranteed. A time limit on support for user-
owned devices could be listed, or the policy might be to only sup-
port software on the device that is required by your organization. 
Placing limits on supporting user-owned devices can help limit the 
liability for supporting those devices.
A very important part of your support policy covers your orga-
nization’s response to lost devices. Due to the potential for your 
data being lost or exposed, a “remote wipe” process should be 
considered. You must have a procedure for reporting lost or stolen 
devices and a policy on when and how devices are wiped. These 
should be included in any BYOD policy and applied when employ-
ees leave your organization. For example, your policy might be 
to issue a remote wipe command to all mobile devices owned by 
an employee when that employee leaves, to prevent unauthorized 
data removal. If you choose to implement this policy, your users 
could complain due to its restrictiveness, but it may be important 
for the protection of your organization.
It is easy to see that defining policies for your mobile tech-
nology strategy is a must; however, those policies don’t help your 
organization if they cannot be monitored or enforced. There are 
ways to monitor and require compliance with almost any policy, 
including some that may seem unenforceable, such as distracted 
driving policies. It is important to find a way to implement those 
configurable policies. The best way to do this is to use a mobile 
device management (MDM) solution. An MDM system that sup-
ports multiple mobile platforms will allow your organization to 
create profiles that configure and enforce your device policies. 

52    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
It is also possible to create multiple profiles to allow for some 
variances in your policies. Some users can have fewer restrictions 
than others due to job requirements. Using an MDM can allow 
you to quickly assign a device to a category so that each employee 
receives the appropriate profile and policy settings. If you use an 
MDM solution, it is important to inform your users that your com-
pany’s BYOD policy requires them to have their devices added to 
the MDM system. It may be intrusive to your users, but it is a must 
to be able to enforce your policies and protect your organization’s 
network and data.
Creating mobile device policies for your organization can be 
a long, and sometimes tedious, process. As you can see, though, it 
is a must to properly secure your data and protect your organiza-
tion and your employees. The policies that you create are another 
block in building your mobile technology strategy.
Properly Provision Your Devices
Provisioning mobile devices consists of everything from getting 
ready for deployment, creating and managing device profiles, 
configuring and enforcing device settings, to, finally, establishing 
a method to monitor and report on your organization’s devices. 
It is the last step in your organization’s strategy before you put the 
devices in users’ hands. All of this can sound like a daunting task. 
Provisioning is a mix of items that involve some strategic plan-
ning when you first decide to bring mobile to your organization, 
and grunt work such as taking devices out of the box, creating an 
inventory, and activating all the devices. However, you can sim-
plify a lot of your provisioning tasks with the previously mentioned 
MDM system. Such a system is useful for maintenance, inventory-
ing, and decommissioning mobile devices. If your organization 
has a large number of mobile devices to support, a proper MDM 
system is a necessity to configure and support them.
Depending on the needs of your organization, an MDM can 
be used to help with almost all of your provisioning requirements 
except for taking the devices out of the box and activating them. For 
that, you will still have to be hands-on. Most mobile devices require 
activation as well, although the activation method varies depend-
ing on the device platform. Android, BlackBerry, and Windows 8 
devices can be activated directly on the device. Older iOS devices 

THE SIX Ps OF MOBILE LEARNING STRATEGY    53
required a connection to a computer running iTunes to be acti-
vated, so, depending on your IT infrastructure, you may still need 
to connect your mobile devices physically. One step that can speed 
up this process is setting up an activation station with iTunes con-
figured in an activation-only mode. That sets iTunes to activate the 
device without syncing it with the computer, which greatly speeds 
up the process.
Once your devices are activated and ready to configure, then 
it is time to configure them to comply with your organization’s 
policies and standards. Network settings, email accounts, security 
restrictions, and other settings could make this a time-consuming 
process, especially for a large organization. This is where an MDM 
system makes your job easier. Create your provisioning profile 
once in the MDM, and then add each device to the MDM list of 
supported devices. The joining process varies from one system to 
the next, but it is still much less time than configuring each device 
by hand. A good MDM solution also makes it easier for your orga-
nization to be flexible in configuring mobile devices. The needs 
of a sales representative are not the same as those of your train-
ers, IT staff, or executives. You can create a separate configuration 
profile for each role and then assign the devices to those in the 
proper roles. This type of configuration gives your organization 
greater control over who has access to specific information and 
applications.
While each mobile platform has its own methods to build and 
deploy configuration profiles, third-party platforms typically offer 
more flexibility, as they often support multiple mobile platforms. 
One platform offering that most people are familiar with may be 
changing that strategy. With their purchase of Ubitexx, Research 
in Motion (now BlackBerry) announced that it would add support 
for iOS and Android devices to their BlackBerry Enterprise Server 
(BES) platform. For organizations that have a long-term invest-
ment in BES, this may provide a chance to broaden their support  
for other devices. The only sure thing about this space is that 
change is going to continue.
Another issue comes up if your organization has decided to 
support a BYOD policy. Users with personal devices that have 
already been activated and set up may not conform to your organi-
zation’s policies. In a recent survey, only 35 percent of companies 
are maintaining a strict limit on mobile devices accessing their 

54    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
networks, but nearly half either do not have, or do not enforce, 
a security policy on user-supplied devices. Creating an official 
BYOD policy for your organization that requires all devices to be 
registered with your MDM system will help keep your network 
more secure. You will be able to implement and enforce your pol-
icies on those devices, as well as protect your information when 
they leave the organization. For users who are worried about los-
ing personal data because of your MDM’s remote wipe capability, 
many systems now offer the ability to “sandbox” personal infor-
mation from your business organization and wipe only the private 
data from your organization.
Is it possible to do all of this without an MDM system? Of 
course, but it becomes much more time-consuming and difficult 
to enforce. For a small organization, it may be possible to get away 
with developing configuration profiles manually and applying 
them before deploying a device, but that will not prevent a user 
from modifying the settings. It also becomes nearly impossible to 
enforce your security policies when you have a BYOD policy with-
out a management system. It doesn’t hurt to plan for growth. If you 
implement MDM when your organization or mobile deployment 
is small, you are establishing a good foundation for the future.
Publish Content for Your Users
At this point in your mobile strategy, you have chosen a platform 
for your organization, procured the devices, developed your 
mobile policies, and provisioned the devices for deployment. Now 
that mobile devices are in your users’ hands, you have to get your 
apps and media to them. Publishing your information is the next 
step in your mobile planning.
Publishing your mobile apps and media inside your organi-
zation can require a significant amount of planning. There are 
a number of steps to consider, from the deployment process to 
updating and securing apps. In your mobile strategy, you must find 
a distribution method that allows you to manage all of these steps.
Putting apps and media onto mobile devices has typically been 
done using one of three methods: (1) the online marketplace 
method, such as Apple’s App Store or Google Play, which are effec-
tive for distributing apps to a large and spread-out user base, but 
really only suitable for consumer media and applications; a large 

THE SIX Ps OF MOBILE LEARNING STRATEGY    55
number of app marketplaces from both mobile platform develop-
ers and third-party sources, in which case your organization needs 
either to choose a marketplace that best serves your requirements 
or use several online locations that will each have to be monitored 
and maintained, as enterprise apps, with sensitive or confiden-
tial information or a limited number of users, don’t fit well in 
a publicly available distribution location; (2) the ad hoc installa-
tion method, also known as sideloading or manual installation on 
some platforms, requires downloading the application installer or 
media file and then manually installing it on the mobile device 
(note that some platforms are easier to manage manually than 
others, but users could find the process confusing or too time- 
consuming to keep things up-to-date); and (3) the third method is 
to build a private app catalog to install apps wirelessly. A private app 
catalog lets you distribute your apps and media to mobile devices 
in a more user-friendly manner. The problem with this method, 
at first, was that it was just an automated way to perform ad hoc 
distribution. Users would receive an email or SMS that contained  
a link to your organization’s private app server. They had to hit 
that link and download the installer and put the applications on 
their devices manually. It helped to get the apps out to users faster 
and to a geographically diverse user base without putting them 
in a public marketplace, but there was still no way to tell whether  
people downloaded and installed the apps or files. In the Enterprise 
IT world, organizations need to know what is installed where, 
and ensure that proper updates occur for security and licensing 
requirements. How can you make that happen in mobile?
A rapidly growing answer to that question is to use mobile appli-
cation management (MAM). These systems allow organizations 
to create a private application catalog that works similarly to the 
public marketplaces. Media files and documents that are useful to 
your mobile users can often be included in a MAM system as well. 
Apps can be categorized and only visible to specific users, as they 
would in a traditional enterprise application deployment system. 
Apps can be updated, either by notifying mobile users or even by 
push updates without user intervention, if the platform supports it. 
Apps can also be removed or disabled from mobile devices if a user 
leaves the organization or has accessed the application improperly, 
without requiring a full device wipe. This can give you more flexi-
bility in making sure mobile devices comply with your policies.

56    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Mobile application development can also benefit from having 
an application management system in place. When it comes time 
to test on the actual devices, being able to publish updates for 
each build is easier than connecting each device and loading the 
app manually. This can dramatically speed up the development 
process in your organization.
MAM systems also can be helpful in monitoring and ensuring 
compliance with application licensing. Your mobile systems admin-
istrator can use a MAM’s reporting features to see which users have 
installed apps or downloaded available media and keep track of or 
limit how many users install a specific app to comply with licensing 
issues. In conjunction with an MDM system, you can have a variety of 
tools to keep your organization in compliance with your mobile strat-
egy. MDM is not the same as MAM, however. Several mobile device 
management platforms offer some application management fea-
tures, but a dedicated mobile application management system usually 
has more features and will serve your organization better.
Mobile application management is a tool that can help with 
your organization’s mobile applications lifecycle, from develop-
ment and testing to deployment and updating. With a bit of plan-
ning, MAM can make it a lot easier to publish the apps and media 
in your organization.
Standardize Your Procedures
Procedures are the end result of standardizing the first five Ps so 
that everyone in your organization is on the same page. Without 
choosing a platform, carefully documenting policies, setting 
up steps to purchase and provision the devices, and publishing 
content, there is no hope to achieve standard operating proce-
dures. Every time you execute the steps, there will be variations in 
the end results that will lower quality, increase costs, or in some 
other way limit the true return on investment. So it is in creating 
standardized procedures that “the rubber meets the road.” With 
proper procedures, you will have the following:
•• A planned platform or platforms to support, with no surprises 
as new mobile handsets and tablets are released;
•• A procurement process that takes into account equipment life-
cycles and replacement planning, as well as buying discounts 
and service level agreements (SLA);

THE SIX Ps OF MOBILE LEARNING STRATEGY    57
•• Policies that can be enforced and are legally defensible. This 
should protect your company’s intellectual property and your 
employees’ rights. The procedures should cover the “What 
If’s” when policies aren’t followed and spell out the enforce-
ment steps that will be taken;
•• You will have a technology solution and business process in 
place to provision the devices as they are brought into the 
workplace. This should cover and enforce your policies, mak-
ing BYOD devices and company devices equal when it comes 
to accessing information needed for performance support. 
This solution should not be dependent on any one individual 
for its implementation, but must be institutionalized;
•• Putting your apps out to your audience shouldn’t be a problem 
either, because the publishing procedures spell out whether 
and when you are targeting the mobile web, private app cata-
logs or MDM/MAM solutions, or putting your apps into public 
marketplaces like the Apple App Store or Google Play.
As you can see, this is the culmination and standardization of 
all of your hard work. Standardization improves efficiency, because 
everyone knows what to do, without having to work through all 
these decisions each time there is a change or addition to your 
mobile system. You’ve come this far, and you owe it to yourself and 
your company to finish the job.
Here are some key points to keep in mind when developing a 
procedures document. Your procedures document must have the 
following characteristics to succeed:
•• It must be accessible. Put it in a centralized repository or on the 
organization’s intranet so that all parties who need to read it 
have access.
•• It must be collaborative. One person is simply not knowledgeable 
about all aspects of a company’s mobile strategy to manage 
everything. Establish a workflow for editing the document or 
use a team environment like a wiki to store this vital resource.
•• It must be updated as time passes. Mobile moves fast. No document 
is going to be etched in stone, because the mobile industry just 
changes too quickly to assign arbitrary update cycles to this.
•• It must be workable. If your procedures document is so loaded 
with jargon and legalese that it makes it tough to implement, 

58    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
you’ll never see the benefits of its creation and rollout. Keep it 
simple!
•• It must be transferable. This is, after all, your company’s policy,  
right? This is not a single person’s domain, even if you  
only have one person manning the servers at your company. 
Because very sensitive data may be being sent on these devices 
outside of the company’s firewall, it’s important that more 
than one person know how the process works.
The six Ps represent the main components of a mobile learn-
ing strategy. Of course, there are a lot more issues to consider 
when it comes time to create and implement a specific strategy for 
your organization.

The Business Case for Mobile 
Learning
John Feser
We have just come out of one of the most severe economic reces-
sions since the Great Depression, with unemployment higher than 
has been seen in decades and companies looking to cut costs in 
every way possible. In these circumstances, how can an investment 
in mobile learning make sense? In difficult economic times, train-
ing budgets are one of the first areas to be reduced or eliminated. 
Employees tend to be more focused on being heads-down and pro-
ductive and doing their jobs than on taking training. Given this sit-
uation, how does a learning professional present a compelling case 
to management to spend money and invest in new skills and new 
technologies? In today’s environment, many people would expect 
to hear a stern reminder of budgetary restraints at such a request.
However, with a modest time investment on your part and a 
critical look at your organization’s operations, you might find that 
now is the perfect time to make an investment in mobile learning. 
Business fundamentals tell us that companies improve their bot-
tom lines in one of two ways: increase revenue or decrease costs; if 
you can do both, all the better. This chapter on the business case 
for mobile learning takes an in-depth look at how mobile learning 
can benefit both sides of the business equation.
First, a quick disclaimer: there is no silver bullet here. 
Every organization is different, from the products it sells to its 

60    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
organizational structure to its unique operations. I cannot pos-
sibly provide all the answers, as the best and appropriate ways to 
increase revenues and decrease costs are specific to each business. 
However, I can provide a few key tips and logical techniques for 
uncovering the opportunities for growing revenue and reducing 
costs in your company using mobile learning.
Mobile learning is about accessing useful information any 
time, anywhere. So the key to building a strong business case for 
mobile learning is to identify ways to provide better and timely 
access to the right information, which can help your company 
increase revenue or decrease costs.
Mobile Learning and Increasing Revenue
Companies generally have three basic ways to generate more 
revenue.
	 1.	 They can sell more of an existing product or service,
	 2.	 They can offer additional products or services, or
	 3.	 They can increase the prices of their products or services.
But none of these methods work magically; there has to be an 
underlying, fundamental change in the demand for your prod-
ucts or services for any of these options to work. Selling more or 
being able to charge more for the same product requires rais-
ing the demand for your product or service through better sales 
and marketing efforts or a perceived differentiation in the mar-
ketplace. Mobile devices can help increase the demand for your 
products and services by providing both your customers and your 
sales force with better access to information about what you sell.
In this chapter, you will notice that the lines between what is 
considered mobile learning and what is known as mobile market-
ing are blurred. This is to be expected. It is difficult to talk about 
growing sales or increasing the demand for products and services 
without talking about marketing in some form or another. For 
instance, does the idea of making your company’s website accessi-
ble on a mobile device strike you as being a marketing activity or 
a mobile learning task? Most people would contend that a com-
pany’s website falls within the marketing department’s domain. 

the business case for mobile learning    61
However, if you subscribe to the idea that mobile learning is about 
“making useful information available any time, anywhere,” then 
it becomes less clear whether a mobile version of your company’s 
website is learning or marketing. The good news is that it really 
doesn’t matter. The same concepts of context and access to infor-
mation apply whether we are talking about mobile learning or 
mobile marketing.
Therefore, if businesses are going to find ways that mobile 
learning (or marketing) can help increase revenue, there has to be  
a plan for increasing demand through the immediate access to 
information that mobile devices offer. This is true both in terms of 
how you sell to your customers and what you sell to your customers.
How You Sell
In order to find ways that mobile learning can help you sell more, 
you must first think about and understand what makes your prod-
uct or service relevant and unique. Three key steps or questions 
come to mind:
	 1.	 Why would someone want to spend money on what you have 
to offer?
	 2.	 What information does a client or a customer need to 
make a well-informed decision? How can they find this 
information?
	 3.	 When do they need to access this information?
By understanding what your customers base their purchas-
ing decisions on, you can be in a better position to provide that 
information via a mobile device. Amazon.com and Target are 
both excellent examples of this. Both have superb websites that 
are optimized for mobile devices. Both provide access to product 
information, price, and availability. Amazon.com’s mobile cus-
tomers even have access to the same user reviews that you can find 
through the full browser version.
Imagine yourself in a store like Best Buy considering the pur-
chase of a new inkjet printer. You might have thought about doing 
some research before you left your house, but you didn’t and now 
you are standing in front of a row of ten printers trying to decide 

62    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
which one to buy. You might ask a salesperson for some sugges-
tions and he or she might be able to give you a good answer, but 
chances are the salesperson hasn’t used all ten products, so know-
ing which one is the best for you might be a guess. But having 
access to reviews and information about the various printers you 
are considering through your mobile phone allows you to make a 
much more informed decision.
Supporting Your Sales Force
Another key mechanism by which a business can improve its 
revenue is through supporting its sales force. If a business goes 
to market with a trained sales force, then those people have a 
focused job description—to generate demand and bring in sales. 
What information needs do they have? How can they best be 
supported in the field? Do you have a diverse product line that 
changes regularly? Do you have frequent turnover in your sales 
force, requiring a heavy investment in regular training? Can some 
of this training be done on the road, as a podcast or a series of 
tip sheets accessible from a mobile phone? By thinking of mobile 
devices as small computers with instant access to information, 
the possibilities are numerous. Like your customers, the key is 
to think about what information your salespeople need to access 
and how you can improve their ability to find information quickly, 
when they need it.
What You Sell
We’ve talked about ways to increase demand through how you sell. 
But what about adding value to what you sell? Just as there are many 
ways to inform and influence the buying decision before a purchase, 
there are equally many ways to use mobile devices to enhance the 
buyer’s perception of your product or service before, during, and 
after the sale has been made. Doing these activities well can lead to 
repeat business and referrals to other potential customers.
Mobile learning offers opportunities to provide a richer, more 
valuable experience with your product or service. To identify these 
opportunities, think about what information you can provide your 
customers that will improve how they use your product or ser-
vice. Also think about the context for how they might access that 

the business case for mobile learning    63
information. For instance, do you want your customers to know 
how to contact the customer service department if they have a 
problem, or do you want them to be able to solve most issues on 
their own? Do you provide troubleshooting tips? Are there user 
forums on which people can share ideas and tips about best prac-
tices for using your product?
Maybe you already provide this information on your compa-
ny’s website. It may be tempting to think that, just because infor-
mation is available via the web on a desktop or laptop computer, 
it doesn’t need to be accessible on a mobile device. However, con-
sidering the rate at which mobile devices are increasingly being 
used to access the web, this may not be a good idea. According to 
a recent Morgan Stanley report, analysts expect that the “mobile 
web” will overtake desktop Internet access by 2015. As more and 
more people access the web from their mobile devices, you have 
to ask yourself: How well can they get to the important informa-
tion about my products and services?
Cutting Costs
The other way of improving profits for a company is to cut costs. 
To quote Benjamin Franklin, “A penny saved is a penny earned.” 
While there are many ways for organizations to manage their costs, 
learning and development efforts usually involve helping people 
do their jobs faster, better, or cheaper.
How does faster, better, cheaper translate into cost savings? 
Working faster means more is done in a shorter period of time. 
This results in fewer people being needed for a particular task, 
more time for other tasks to be completed, and, just as import­
antly, the ability to handle more (more warranty work, more ser-
vice calls, etc.) with the same number of people. Working better 
translates into higher quality output, which results in fewer service 
calls, warranty claims, and rework, not to mention happier custom-
ers. Working cheaper means using fewer resources to complete a 
task. This could mean anything from using fewer raw materials 
to using less expensive computers or software. For any of these 
improvements to actually reduce costs, a reduction of costs in one 
of these areas cannot be offset by an increase of costs in other 
areas. For example, it doesn’t help to simply work faster if there is 
a corresponding drop in the quality of the final product. So what 

64    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
are some of the ways that mobile learning can help people work 
faster, better, and cheaper?
Reference Materials and Job Aids
One form of mobile learning consists of reference material and 
job aids. Mobile devices, with their instant-on, always connected 
qualities, can offer a rich library of information for service techni-
cians and others who travel for their jobs. Imagine a new washer 
and dryer repair person who has been trained on the latest mod-
els produced by his company, but has not been in the business 
long enough to see the differences from washers and dryers that 
were made five or ten years ago. By putting repair manuals online 
and making them easily accessible through a mobile device like a 
smart phone or a tablet, the need to carry and keep track of poten-
tially hundreds of paper repair manuals is eliminated. In addition, 
if designed properly, these reference materials can provide sig-
nificantly faster access to information and offer much more detail 
than what traditionally has been produced with paper manuals.
This same basic principle can be used in other industries as 
well. Arborists, who have to identify and diagnose many different 
forms of tree diseases, can benefit from having diagnostic pictures 
available on their mobile devices, along with prescriptions for 
treatment. In addition, the geolocation feature on many smart 
phones can help by automatically sorting and filtering the infor-
mation based on the arborist’s location and the types of trees that 
are most common to that geographic area.
These forms of reference materials can reduce costs in a num-
ber of ways. First, the cost to update electronically available mate-
rials is significantly less than the cost for updating and reprinting 
paper versions of manuals and reference guides. Second, when 
designed properly, access can be much faster and easier than for 
traditional paper-based materials. The geolocation feature is one 
example; a well-indexed and fully searchable reference guide is 
another example of how companies can save costs by providing 
faster access to information. Finally, the opportunities for collab-
oration and communication with a mobile/electronic version of 
various reference guides and job aids should not be overlooked. 
Imagine if the washer/dryer repairperson found an error in the 
manual or a more efficient way to make a repair. By his having  

the business case for mobile learning    65
the ability to comment on or rate that section of the job aid, 
others could easily benefit from the experience. In essence, the 
experts are continually updating the repair manual of the future. 
It’s the Wikipedia for washer/dryer repair manuals; it’s the Bing 
for HVAC technicians.
Performance Support Tools
Another related, but distinct area of mobile learning that can 
help organizations reduce costs are performance support 
tools. Performance support tools, like reference guides and job  
aids, help people do their jobs better and more efficiently. For 
example, in the construction industry, equipment safety checks 
are a critical part of preventing accidents and keeping workers 
free from injury. Organizations such as OSHA in the United States 
require these safety checks to be documented as part of standard 
start-up procedures for various types of equipment. Often, the 
documentation is misplaced or forgotten. Lack of compliance can 
lead to fines and increased insurance costs or worse—accidents 
that have severe ramifications. One need only look a little closer 
at the recent oilrig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico to hear how 
shortcuts were encouraged and safety practices were not followed 
in order to bring the oil platform online faster. An electronic 
checklist created for use on a mobile device can have several 
advantages to ensuring compliance. First, there is an electronic 
record that the inspection has been completed that can be sent to 
a centralized database. If an inspection has not been completed 
by a specified time, a reminder notice can be sent to the machine 
operator or the safety manager. If a safety issue is detected, it can 
be recorded using the camera.
A company called Earthrise Technology has developed an 
innovative mobile performance support tool. Earthrise is a sub-
sidiary of Digisec Group (www.digisecgroup.com), a leading 
supplier of after-market automotive security products in China 
that also develops and distributes state-of-the-art telematics prod-
ucts for the transportation industry. Earthrise recently released 
a product called Eco-Way that combines a personal navigation 
system with an on-board diagnostic system that monitors a num-
ber of factors related to how efficiently a vehicle is operating and 
how economically the driver is operating the vehicle. This tool 

66    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
provides real-time data to those driving the vehicle as well as a 
web portal for others to review, making it ideal for transporta-
tion companies wanting to better manage their fuel consumption 
costs. For companies that have large fleets of vehicles and spend 
significant amounts on fuel, this tool can serve as an excellent 
training device to help drivers maximize their fuel efficiency and 
help vehicle maintenance workers keep vehicles properly tuned. 
Earthrise estimates that, through the use of Eco-Way, drivers can 
improve their gas mileage and reduce their carbon emissions by 
up to 45 percent.
Applications for Your Company
If your company doesn’t repair washers and dryers or have arbor-
ists who examine trees for disease and infection, what applicability 
does this have to you and your organization? What if you are not 
part of a construction company or one that has a large fleet of 
vehicles? How do you apply the principles of mobile learning to 
manage costs in your company? With any organization, the proc­
ess of managing costs begins by first looking for opportunities. Set 
aside for a moment the idea of mobile learning and examine how 
employees are spending their time and the quality of the work 
they produce. What information do they require on a regular basis 
to do their jobs and do those jobs expertly? Focus on the time they 
are away from their desks and don’t have access to a traditional 
desktop or laptop computer. What must they do while they are at 
their desks that they cannot currently do elsewhere?
Remember, today’s mobile devices have as much computing 
power as the desktops from just ten years ago and, in many cases, 
they have a much faster connection to the Internet. Can you pro-
vide them with better access to information? Are there ways to 
combine learning with their daily activities (like Eco-Way does for 
drivers)? Taking a step-by-step approach best solves cost reduc-
tions, like many other business challenges. Start by breaking the 
problem into parts; then look for opportunities for improvement. 
When all the features of today’s mobile devices are combined with 
the information needs required by many of today’s jobs, practical 
opportunities present themselves. With patience and a question-
ing attitude, there is no doubt that cost reduction opportunities 
exist with the use of effective mobile learning.

the business case for mobile learning    67
Conclusion
When it comes to growing the top line of your business, mobile 
learning and mobile marketing have a lot in common. Whatever 
you call it, the key is to make sure your potential customers and 
those who have purchased your products or services have access 
to the information they need. By putting yourself in the shoes 
of your customers or your sales force, you can identify ways that 
providing “useful information any time, anywhere” can enhance 
people’s experience and perception of what you sell. With some 
focused time investment and a critical look at the company’s sales  
activities and practices, a business can most likely improve its top 
line through the use of mobile learning. At the same time, there 
are many ways for mobile learning to support cutting costs, con-
tributing directly to a company’s bottom line. Doing both is opti-
mal and possible with the implementation of mobile learning.

The New “Nomadism” as a 
Driver of Mobile Learning
Gary Woodill
The idea of mobile learning has been talked about seriously for 
only about twenty years, but the dream of using mobile electronic 
devices to communicate is at least one hundred years old. In the 
past two or three years, there has been a rapid increase in both 
the visibility and publicity surrounding mobile learning. What is 
driving this recent surge in interest?
One obvious answer is the explosive growth of mobile phones, 
particularly smart phones, in recent years. The number of mobile 
phone subscribers has far outstripped the number of Internet 
users since the mid-1990s. There are now more than six billion 
mobile phone subscribers worldwide. Eighty-five percent of that 
growth has come from emerging markets, such as Latin America, 
Eastern Europe, the Middle East, India, and China. In these coun-
tries, many people cannot afford a computer, but often they can 
afford a mobile phone. In North America, the dramatic growth of 
the use of smart phones and tablets has allowed mobile learning 
to become widespread.
Another driver for mobile learning is the fact that people are 
more and more on the move. In 2008, The Economist magazine 
published a special report on “The New Nomadism.” Because of 
our increased mobility, people are less likely to want to stay in one 

70    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
place in order to attend school or train in a specific location. With 
the new possibilities of connectivity to information from wherever 
we are, there is no need to hang around home base.
This new ability to move using improved transportation sys-
tems has led to the creation of entire categories of mobile workers, 
especially those in field services and in sales. As well, our ability to 
move has led to people living at an increased distance from their 
workplaces, making telecommuting very attractive. The shedding 
of permanent full-time jobs and their replacement by temporary 
and part-time service jobs that can be done at home or by virtual 
teams has also increased the attractiveness of learning from any 
location at any time.
Of course, much has been made of the new generation that 
is entering the workforce in terms of their intimate knowledge 
of computers and mobile devices. But I think this has been over-
blown as a driver, in that the use of mobile learning needs to make 
business sense, rather than simply catering to the desires of a new 
set of workers. Yet, there’s no denying that many of us, of all ages, 
become very attached to our mobile phones and tablets. There’s 
even a psychiatric condition called “nomophobia” to describe 
those who become anxious when not in the presence of their 
mobile phone, or when their batteries run out. The British Post 
Office has actually done a research study on this condition.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly for the corporate train-
ing audience, there are solid business reasons for the adoption 
of mobile learning. First, the widespread deployment of mobile 
phones means that an infrastructure for mobile learning is 
already in place. This means that there are already communica-
tion devices in the pockets of most workers, with access to email, 
texting, and the Internet.
Mobile learning, when properly designed, can be described 
as “just in time, just enough, and just for me.” Researchers have 
found that it improves retention in learning, because what is 
learned is relevant to the situation at hand. Mobile learning has 
the potential to leverage the “idle time” of workers on the move, 
who would likely otherwise be unproductive. On the other hand, 
people need time off, and the use of mobile learning can be seen 
in some situations as a way of unfairly increasing workloads with-
out compensation.

the new “nomadism” as a driver of mobile learning    71
Mobile learning has potential to change the way people work 
together. It can result in increased collaboration and a sense of 
community, and it can give employees up-to-date information that 
they need in their jobs. At the same time, such information can be 
personalized and contextualized according to each person’s work 
situation. In short, mobile learning has “come of age.”

Creating a Mobile Learning 
Content Strategy
Chad Udell
What is content strategy? In its simplest terms, content strategy for 
formal learning is a holistic plan for content, the knowledge that 
you want the learner to receive and retain. The strategy should 
include the planning, creation, governance, publication, and 
long-term maintenance of the desired content. In bigger terms, 
content strategy is looking at the material you produce for your 
audience from the perspective of an “information steward” and 
making informed decisions that improve the transfer of the knowl-
edge shared and the sustainability of the information source that 
­provided it.
This emerging and critical aspect of instructional design is 
part of the new normal of being learning professionals in the con-
nected age of ubiquitous access and user-generated content. It is 
simply not enough to create once, publish, and then move on. We 
must think through the lifecycle of the content and plan for its 
optimal delivery through the mechanisms we have available to us, 
regardless of technology or platform.
Content strategy may seem unrelated to learning profession-
als. However, this topic has been long studied and employed in 
the marketing and web worlds to great success and deserves a 
place in our essential skill sets. Numerous blog articles have been 

74    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
written on it, the most notable being “The Discipline of Content 
Strategy” by Kristina Halvorson at A List Apart. A number of books 
have been written on content strategy, as well. I recommend 
Karen McGrane’s (2012) Content Strategy for Mobile as an excellent, 
easy-to-read introduction to the subject that offers a clear plan  
to action.
Karen McGrane’s steps for a content strategy include:
	 1.	 Perform audience research.
	 2.	 Perform competitive research.
	 3.	 Perform content inventory and analysis.
	 4.	 Choose delivery platforms appropriately.
	 5.	 Don’t fork your content, yet edit to meet delivery needs.
An important takeaway is that our roles as learning profession-
als responsible for the delivery of content are changing (and, inci-
dentally, will continue to change). We must continue to evolve and 
work to create a content framework that is scalable and strong, 
flexible yet authoritative. Candidly, it’s not easy, but the very chal-
lenge is what makes the role so interesting and important. This 
is definitely different from the “set it and forget it” approach to 
creating curriculum and courseware we have used in the past.
This new approach to content creation and lifecycle is needed 
if we are to keep up with ever-tightening product cycles. It is a 
must if we hope to deliver content on the devices and platforms 
of today and tomorrow. With appropriate planning, it is possible. 
A bit of time in research and planning pays big dividends here.
We have to create a systemic (meaning deeply ingrained in the 
system) and systematic (carried out using step-by-step processes 
and procedures) approach to delivering content to our learners. 
This is the How and When of What we are going to share with our 
audiences.
Consider the various ways you interact with websites or plat-
forms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, CNN.com, Netflix, or 
Amazon. Every one of those companies has a different experi-
ence for the users, depending on the device each user employs to 
access the content. An app is different from a set top box, which 
is also different from a web browser, which is different from the 
mobile web. Pumping their respective sites through some kind 

creating a mobile learning content strategy    75
of magic transformer didn’t create these experiences. Some fea-
tures are omitted or tucked away, as they may be unneeded in a 
particular case, but the key functions the user requires in that par-
ticular case—desktop, web, mobile, or other—are accounted for  
and designed.
So, too, will your carefully crafted mobile learning experi-
ences need to account for these platforms. Running your Flash 
course through some sort of HTML5 mill is not the answer. You 
must redesign and adapt your applications to fit within your con-
tent strategy for mobile. Beyond basic considerations, such as user 
interface, element size, and scale, there are more dramatic shifts 
you will have to make in your thinking.
Some of the content from your original software may stay 
largely intact. A thoroughly indexed and well-manicured com-
pany wiki may require only a new mobile theme, and perhaps 
the addition of some basic contextual awareness (geolocation 
could be really useful, for example) to make it a valuable mobile 
­learning tool. Other items—immersive software simulations, for 
example—may require more thought prior to porting the content 
to mobile handsets (or perhaps skipping this approach for more 
effective uses of resources). Mobile devices do have constraints 
in terms of screen size, bandwidth, and processing power, and in 
order to match the experience to the target platform, you may 
have to take these factors into account in your design process.
On the topic of straight content conversion from e-learning to 
mlearning, I have mixed reactions. While, yes, it’s great to be free 
to leverage your content and repackage it for a new class of users in 
need of it, none of the simple paths to mobile learning I have seen 
truly put mobile considerations into the design up-front. They may 
apply a new mobile-friendly skin to the content, sure, but that’s the 
easy way out. Seldom do I hear of learners impressed by mobile 
content delivery. On the other hand, I do hear people impressed 
by Urbanspoon’s scope feature, Path’s streamlined feel on smart 
phones, or Twitter’s ease of uploading images or adding location 
data to posts. This sort of smart user experience design, coupled 
with content strategy, takes work. If page-turning e-learning were a 
sure-fire way to create snoozeware on the desktop, then it is death 
on the mobile side.
If we want to escape that perilous trap, we must plan our path 
to the mobile learning landscape of tomorrow.

Seven Easy and Inexpensive 
Ways to Launch Mobile 
Learning
John Feser
Your initial foray into mobile learning doesn’t need to be compli-
cated, require a five-figure budget to implement, or dramatically 
alter how your company conducts training. The great thing about 
mlearning is that it encompasses so many forms of knowledge trans-
fer and sharing that there are many creative implementations, all of 
which fit neatly into the category of mobile learning. Here are seven 
easy and relatively low-cost (in some cases free) ways to implement 
mobile learning. My hope is that these will not only be useful, but will 
also help to trigger other ideas that can be implemented and shared.
1. Micro-Blogging
Micro-blogging is a web-based service that involves sending or 
broadcasting short messages to a specific group of individuals who 
are signed up or have “subscribed” to be a part of that group. 
Twitter and Yammer are examples of two popular micro-blogging 
services, the former being free yet public and the latter offering 
paid subscriptions to set up a private group. Both services are eas-
ily accessed on mobile devices, making them accessible wherever 
a cellular or Wi-Fi connection is available. Micro-blogging works 
C H A P T E R  1 0

78    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
great as a simple messaging and collaboration tool. For instance, a 
salesperson could send a message to his or her colleagues such as, 
“Getting a lot of pushback on our recent price increases. Anyone 
have a suggested response?” Others who see the message can eas-
ily weigh in on the conversation. Because these services work with 
SMS, virtually any mobile phone user can have access to this infor-
mation and participate in the conversation.
2. Create a WordPress Website or Blog
WordPress is an open source publishing platform for the web. It 
was started in 2003 as a blogging tool, but has since matured into a 
very robust content management system. Because it is open source, 
it is free to download and use. From a technical standpoint, all that 
is needed is a web server running PHP and MySQL. What makes 
WordPress so useful for mlearning is the wide variety of mobile-
friendly themes and plugins. Using a responsive design based 
theme, for example, a list of a company’s safety rules and regula-
tions could easily be documented using WordPress. When workers 
on a jobsite need access to those rules and regulations, they can 
easily pull up the site and search for the information they need.
3. Start a YouTube Channel
While someone will often read a recipe in a cookbook or magazine, 
think how much more powerful it is to watch a chef demonstrate 
how to make a particular dish on TV. In many situations, video 
can be used as an excellent learning tool. When being able to 
visualize a task or view a series of steps is easier and more efficient 
than a text description or static photos, videos can work extremely 
well. Creating a YouTube channel provides a way to organize vid-
eos that are created for a specific purpose or company. YouTube 
videos play on many of today’s mobile devices, making this a great 
site on which to put mobile content.
4. SMS (Text) Message Alerts
Today, virtually 100 percent of all mobile phones have the ability 
to send and receive text messages. This capability, along with a 
relatively low overhead cost, makes text messaging an ideal way to 

SEVEN EASY AND INEXPENSIVE WAYS TO LAUNCH MOBILE    79
distribute bite-sized learning nuggets. There are numerous exam-
ples of how text messaging can assist in the mobile learning arena. 
One example is reminders for a group or team. Imagine a safety 
manager on a construction site. At 5 a.m. he notices the weather 
forecast for the day is hot and humid. So using a service to send 
SMS messages to a group of people, he sends a reminder to all the 
members of his crew, “Forecast for today is hot and humid. Don’t 
forget to bring adequate sun protection (hat, sun block, etc.) and 
extra water.” In sending a message that costs his company around 
5 cents or less, he may prevent a worker from having heat exhaus-
tion, heat stroke, or something worse.
Another example of SMS usage in a corporate setting is in 
the on-boarding of personnel. In this situation, text messages 
can be scheduled to be sent over the first week or month of 
a person’s employment. The messages can be anything from 
a reminder to complete specific paperwork to providing 
­additional information about the company that may not have 
been presented during the initial orientation. This type of 
on-boarding can create a connection that eventually leads to a 
more engaged (read productive) employee. There are a num-
ber of text messaging services that offer a variety of ways to send 
text messages.
5. Create a Mobile Version of Your PowerPoint Slides
It is generally not recommended to simply convert a PowerPoint 
presentation to something that can be viewed on a mobile phone 
and call it mlearning. There are many instances where this would 
be wholly ineffective. Who wants to look at a two-hour, 150 slide 
presentation on a company’s strategic initiatives on an iPhone? 
However, there are other instances when a PowerPoint presen-
tation specifically designed for a mobile device can make sense. 
Reference documents are a great example. Think of informa-
tion like product data, tip sheets, or quick reference guides as 
information that could be made available on a mobile device 
through the conversion of a PowerPoint document. There are a 
number of ways to make a PowerPoint mobile ready. The meth-
ods that are most appropriate depend on whether the document 
must be resident on the phone so that it can be accessed when 
the phone is not connected, and on the types of phones used by  

80    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
the target audience. One option is to use SlideShare. SlideShare 
has a mobile version that works on iPhone and Android operating 
systems. Another option is to create a video of the PowerPoint 
presentation. This method has the added benefit of being able to 
easily handle audio narration. The video can then be published  
to YouTube or downloaded directly to a mobile device. One option 
for this is to use a tool like authorSTREAM to create a video ver-
sion of your PowerPoint. Creating videos with an authorSTREAM 
watermark is free. If you want videos without the watermark, there 
is a fee.
6. Audio Podcasting
Podcasts can be a great form of mobile learning because of their 
flexibility. Whether mowing the grass, driving to work, or wait-
ing at the airport, audio podcasts are a great way to communi-
cate information or share knowledge because they only require 
one sense: hearing. Depending on the content and the type of 
information being shared, this allows the learner to be engaged in 
other activities while learning. Obviously, audio podcasting is not 
an effective approach to mobile learning in all cases. Certainly, 
situations that involve visualization or learner interactivity are not 
appropriate. But audio podcasts work very well when presenting 
information to an interested audience and when engaging story-
telling can be incorporated into the content. A number of free 
tools are available for creating audio podcasts, and some excellent 
step-by-step tutorials are available as well. The basic steps involve 
creating the audio file, converting to the correct format, and pub-
lishing the podcast.
7. Poll Everywhere
Poll Everywhere is a web-based audience response service that 
allows a presenter or trainer to ask a question and receive audience 
feedback via SMS text messages or Twitter or the web. Responses 
can then be displayed in real time in PowerPoint, Keynote, or on a 
web page. The advantages of Poll Everywhere are (1) it is easy and 
(2) it is relatively inexpensive (or even free!), depending on the 
size of the audience you wish to poll. Polling during a presentation 

SEVEN EASY AND INEXPENSIVE WAYS TO LAUNCH MOBILE    81
is an excellent way to engage your audience, gather feedback, and 
allow them to participate in the discussion. Give it a try!
A word of caution: just because something is easy and inex-
pensive does not necessarily make it the right tool for the job. 
One can easily go to a local discount store and purchase a child’s 
wagon for a relatively low cost. But if you try to use it to haul five 
tons of rock from the landscaping company across town, you will 
find your wagon is not very effective. However, borrowing your 
neighbor’s pickup truck may be equally easy and cost you nothing 
more than a friendly beer shared on the back porch or a gift card 
to a local restaurant. The point is, no matter how easy and inex-
pensive something is, you still have to select the right tool for the 
job or, in the case of mobile learning, the right design to meet the 
learning objectives.
The seven ideas presented here can all be effective in certain 
situations and not at all effective in others. When implementing 
mlearning, be sure to think of the contextual goals of the learners 
to make sure they are using the right tool for the job.

Building Brand Advocacy  
Through Mobile Learning
Scott McCormick and Chad Udell
Educational marketing is a concept that has been around for a long 
time. The basic concept can be explained simply as “An educated 
customer is an engaged customer.” An informed customer is more 
likely to understand and appreciate the value of your product or 
service offerings and, therefore, more likely to buy or recommend 
your product to others. This is known in marketing circles as “brand  
advocacy.” Writers and bloggers like Word of Moss, Seth Godin,  
and many others have been writing about this concept for some time.
Most of the time, brand advocacy takes place in one of two 
ways. It can be an organic process, with customers becoming advo-
cates by virtue of the product being great. This usually results in 
them telling others about the product or service. Brand advocacy 
can also be seeded, with companies sending freebies, samples, 
and other offers to influential bloggers and Twitter users. These 
influencers then share their feelings on the product (positive, one 
hopes). Either way, there is no debate that brand advocacy is an 
effective way to turn more people on to your product and that it 
does matter in a modern marketing effort. These types of advo-
cacy are considered authentic and real and therefore carry much 
more gravitas and weight than traditional commercials or ads. 
They have longer term and more lasting effects than viral cam-
paigns and cost virtually nothing in comparison to other more 

84    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
conventional marketing, such as radio, print, and television. This 
type of marketing takes advantage of the social media concept, 
“wisdom of friends,” putting stock in the fact that people take 
their social network’s recommendations very seriously and that it 
definitely influences and impacts their buying habits.
What does this all have to do with mobile learning, you might 
ask? Well, what if you could harness the power of mobile learning 
to help create brand advocates among your existing customers? 
What if you could produce great content that empowered your 
customers? Content that informed them and helped them see the 
value of your products, even more than they already do? This con-
tent should instruct users on how to make the most out of your 
products, whether home improvement tools, a vacation pack-
age, or electronics. By giving users useful and fresh educational 
content, your mobile application (“there’s an app for that”) is 
more likely to be reused. In Josh Clark’s excellent book Tapworthy 
(2010), it was revealed that users download ten apps per month 
on average, and most are not launched more than twenty times. 
After two months, only one-third of apps are used at all. Gimmick 
apps are used only a handful of times. Consider this example: a 
virtual circular saw is cute, but will only be used three to five times; 
however, an app with videos on how to actually use a circular saw 
may be used two or three times more than a non-video-based app. 
Couple that content with social media sharing features and you 
can help to create your own little army of brand advocates.
In an article published in Learning Solutions magazine, 
Float’s John Feser (2010) asked, “Who Owns Mobile in Your 
Organization?” Based on our observations of the marketplace and 
paying attention to what our contacts are telling us, more often 
than not, sales and marketing departments are very influential 
in getting mobile initiatives rolling in the enterprise. You can see 
this in a quick search of various mobile app stores; it is clear that 
product catalogs and simple gimmick apps abound. Who funded 
development of these apps? Well, it certainly wasn’t IT, or learn-
ing and development. Very likely, the marketing budget paid for 
these experiments in mobile learning. This really needs to change 
going forward, especially if you want to build brand advocates and 
empower your customers to help you sell to their social networks. 
Why? Well, who knows more about how to use your products than 
the learning department? Who knows how to pull together the 

building brand advocacy through mobile learning     85
subject-matter experts (SMEs), content, resources, and talent to 
produce great content that is useful to people? You should be 
pointing at yourself right about now.
So what should you do? One easy thing would be to take a look 
at your industry and see how online educational content is being 
packaged to consumers. Hardware companies frequently have 
“Projects and Advice” sections on their websites, and electronics 
resellers have question-and-answer sections on how to connect the 
devices they sell. Use this research to frame up some easy ways to 
bring useful information to your customers. Then, after you have 
some ideas, talk to marketing. Perhaps there is a way to partner 
and share your budgets and resources to produce something truly 
great and a game changer to boot. Executives should see an appli-
cation that truly sets your organization and its products or services 
apart as distinct and valuable. Often, the content that the learning 
department is creating for owner manuals and sales training is not 
really that different than the brochures shipped to the customers 
or the videos on the site showing the features and benefits of the 
product.
Some basic things to consider in the content you provide are 
listed below. This is, after all, training, not a hard sell, so please 
remember that in order to build advocacy your content needs to:
•• Provide real, timely, and actionable help information,
•• Use the product as a user would, that is, don’t feature it as a 
“star,”
•• Use the product safely, and just as you would want a consumer 
to use it, and
•• Subtly reinforce your product’s value proposition.
We strongly recommend using high production values in the 
content. Such a mobile app is more likely to have a much larger 
audience than you may be used to targeting. A typical internal 
sales module may only have an audience of hundreds of employ-
ees who are accustomed to internal jargon, photography, and 
video styles. Externally facing content needs to be more polished. 
You may want to consider hiring professional talent and scouting 
for a shooting location, rather than the typical talking heads in 
non-professionally produced content.

86    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
In preparing to deliver this content, please remember to set 
yourself up for success. Plan for measurement and metrics. In-app 
analytics are a must; creating a landing page at your site for the 
app store traffic is a basic requirement; using simple ecommerce 
conversion tools like promo codes is a viable option; and using a 
social media measurement platform like Owl.ly would be a smart 
thing to do. This will enable you to know who is sharing content 
from your app and, more importantly, who is buying based on 
their experience with the app. Remember, satisfied customers tell 
three others about how they feel about your product, angry ones 
tell three thousand.
Your next step should be to consider how brand advocacy 
could work for your brand. Are companies in your vertical space 
using it or experiencing the benefits of putting educational con-
tent onto their customers’ smart phones? You should talk to 
marketing. Are they using brand advocacy in their efforts? How 
are they building it? Could they benefit from your content and 
expertise on creating learning? You have the great opportunity of 
bringing a very powerful audience to your company via a partner-
ship between the marketing and learning departments and their 
respective audiences.
A Case Study of Brand Advocacy: State Farm 
Insurance
Let’s take a close look at an application that is a great example of 
brand advocacy. Did you know that State Farm Insurance is in the 
moving business? Of course not. They aren’t and have no plans to 
be. So why do they have a full-featured mobile application called 
MoveTools in the Apple App Store? MoveTools is an interactive 
planner that helps the user through all of the details of a house 
move. It comes with sections like “To-Do List,” “Pack Up,” and 
“Moving Tips,” and it has a planner to remind you of the different 
steps you should be taking in the weeks leading up to the move. It 
not only provides helpful content, but it allows you to input your 
own information about your move. In the “Pack Up” section, the 
user can create a packing process parallel to their actual box pack-
ing, which results in a digital list of all the boxes and what is con-
tained in each. The user can print out labels with bar codes that 
can be read by a smart phone that contains a list of the contents

for each box! It is a complete app to make any move significantly 
smoother.
All analysis of the content, functionality, and construction of 
the app aside, why is State Farm, a leading insurance company, mak-
ing this app available to the public? Your first answer might be so 
that they can sell more insurance. Certainly, that is an ultimate goal 
but any type of “sales” content within the app is contained within a 
very small popup menu that is revealed when the user touches the 
State Farm logo in the bottom menu bar. It’s inconspicuous and, in 
fact, almost hidden. The obvious motivation for the application is 
for State Farm to strengthen their brand to a target audience. The 
application itself is conveying a message that has a positive effect on 
users such that they will associate the good experience with State 
Farm. Because of this, the MoveTools app is an excellent example 
of brand advocacy. Let’s take a look at how that works.
First of all, the MoveTools application solves a problem; it 
relieves pain or stress. Have you ever met anyone who likes to 
move? In fact, usually when people move, at some time during 
the move they proclaim, “We are never moving again!” The entire 
moving process is a stressful experience. State Farm tries to allevi-
ate some of that anxiety by providing an app that helps the user 
be organized and more efficient in the multitude of steps it takes 
to execute a move. The availability of the app creates all sorts of 
positive touch points between the target audience and State Farm. 
When the user opens the app, the State Farm logo is apparent, but 
not obtrusive, so it serves as a constant reminder of who is provid-
ing relief at a difficult time. The app is designed in the State Farm 
branding guidelines so it has the “look and feel” of State Farm. If 
used correctly, the app is needed throughout the whole moving 
process so dozens, if not hundreds, of impressions take place over 
the move. After successful use of the app, the user tells a friend 
about it and two more friends, and before long they have become 
brand advocates as well. They might not even be State Farm cus-
tomers! When a mom learns that her neighbor is moving and she 
recommends the MoveTools app, then brand advocacy is in action.
A mobile application can also reinforce a brand’s core quali-
ties. As mentioned, State Farm is not in the moving business. But, 
as any insurance company would like to be known, they are in 
the “help you with big life decisions” business. They want their 
customers to think of them first if they have a critical or difficult 

88    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
experience or change in life. Whether it’s an auto accident, a 
tornado disaster, or knowing loved ones are taken care of if the 
head of the household dies, there are answers and security in  
the brand. That’s why MoveTools is such an appropriate brand 
advocate. It reinforces the fact that State Farm is a brand of 
strength and expertise—a leader in their industry.
A mobile application can also be a significant differentia-
tor for you in your market or industry. If you have a message to 
put out, you need to find ways to stand out, especially if you are 
broadcasting your message in a cacophony of other messages. 
Because mobile content delivery is still a nascent technology, 
there is a good chance you are delivering your message on this 
platform before your competitors or from whomever you need 
to distance yourself. Mobile also says you are progressive and 
forward-thinking. Let your audience know that you care enough 
about them to deliver information to their mobile devices so you 
can get the message right into their hands any time, anywhere. 
Like any longstanding company, State Farm fights an image that 
they are conservative. The MoveTools application sends the mes-
sage that, as a company, they are adapting to new technology to 
meet the needs of their target audience. This result shows that 
the mobile application not only reinforces the core qualities  
of the brand, but it can also start and fortify new qualities, too.
One final clue that the goal of this application is to strengthen 
the State Farm brand: it is available for free. State Farm wants it  
in the hands of anyone who wants to use it or even thinks he or she 
might use it. The messaging about the brand is meant for public 
consumption—for customers and non-customers alike. So what is 
the ROI for this app? After countless successful user experiences, 
State Farm has “hired” an untold amount of brand advocates, work-
ing for free in their neighborhoods and towns. Not a bad ROI!

Developing a Mobile 
Management Strategy
Gary Woodill and Scott McCormick
We all know the scene. Row after row of cubicles as far as the eye 
can see with each one looking almost exactly the same. That may 
describe a corporation you have visited, or perhaps you can look 
down the aisle from where you sit and see that very landscape.
You’ll also notice that each cubicle contains a computer. From 
desktop to desktop, the PC is the same make, same model, and if  
you were to boot it up, the same applications are locked and 
loaded. Why is everything the same? Why can’t employees have a 
little hardware and software freedom of expression in their jobs?
You don’t need to go much further than to ask the first com-
pany IT technician who walks past your cubicle. It is his or her job 
to keep your computer and all the hardware and software in the 
company running smoothly and to keep it stable and manageable. 
Yes, that charge does keep you restricted to a specific PC and on 
a predetermined operating system (OS) that may all seem hope-
lessly out of date, but it also keeps you and everyone else in the 
company, well, up and running (for the most part).
But what if all the rules changed? What if everyone had different 
computers, different models, different brand names, different oper-
ating systems, a different assortment of applications, different email 
clients, different . . . everything?
That dilemma is what IT departments are facing in the mobile 
age. A plethora of devices, operating systems, and applications 

90 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
are all coming to play in the corporate workspace. And their job 
is to manage and maintain all of these devices, as well as keep 
them working for you properly so you can do your job. Mobile 
content delivery in the workplace has caused IT departments to 
expand their knowledge base exponentially to accommodate the 
new technologies, or to put a stranglehold on multiple platforms 
in order to keep things under control.
Traditionally, the IT department is accustomed to exerting 
control over computers within an organization. IT controls the 
software installations, licensing, backups, patches, versioning, 
upgrades, and security. IT also acts as a guarantor for informa-
tion systems. They ensure maximum availability and information 
integrity, act as a policing system for violations of policy or threats 
to security, offer technical expertise for swift problem resolution,  
and maintain technical relationships with partners. These tasks and 
services have become dependent on their ability to maintain cen-
tralization. The sudden influx of privately owned mobile devices 
into the workplace has become a threat to the established order.
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
The advent of smart phones and tablets at affordable prices means 
that high-capacity computing outside the control of IT is enter-
ing the workplace. This new upstart technology has less overall 
capability than the old PC-based systems, but greater flexibility 
afforded through peripherals, specialized apps, texting, imaging, 
and voice. The portability and sheer convenience mean that these 
devices are being used in employee functions.
For example, outside salespeople have become dependent on 
these devices to keep them connected, at any time, to their cli-
ents and sales support teams. They use them to touch base with 
the customers, run conference calls, maintain their contact lists, 
organize their leads and sales funnels, text their technical staff,  
keep up with industry announcements, follow professional publi-
cations . . . the list goes on.
A side-effect of mobile is that these devices are effectively 
substituting for traditional computers and their software systems 
in many day-to-day tasks. Laptops, in particular—which are less 
convenient to the mobile worker than the average mobile device 
(they must be removed from a case, powered up, and physically 

developing a mobile management strategy  91
supported)—are being replaced for some activities, often by the 
employee’s own decision. This is not simply an issue of redundancy 
of equipment. This movement can have serious consequences for 
IT because established systems begin to unravel when replaced by 
external, independent alternatives. This risk is pronounced when 
IT is slow in accommodating innovation.
In the case of salespeople, who are totally focused on making 
sales and generating revenue, there may be a risk of them adopting 
their own personal sales support systems on their mobile devices 
and not using the corporate-sponsored software packages. This is 
clearly an issue and, should this person be a high-performance 
employee bringing much value to the bottom line, a difficult one 
to solve.
First, mobile technologies may enable a salesperson’s success; 
therefore, interference may be detrimental to the organization’s 
income. Second, it’s difficult to discipline a renegade for being 
successful and “A” players may choose to move on rather than 
conform. Mobile device users need to be accommodated, and 
this must be in a manner that also addresses the concerns of the 
organization.
Accommodation of mobile technologies can be accom-
plished through issuing standardized, corporate devices (also 
called corporate liable devices), or through the concept of 
“bring your own device” (BYOD), where the organization 
embraces the idea of a mobilized workforce, but the work-
ers supply their own hardware, such as an iPhone or Android 
device. Many organizations are finding that their employees are 
pushing for this (Messmer, 2012). Ricoh America, in response 
to the mobile tsunami, recently opened the door for BYOD for 
its sales, field engineers, and administrative staff. Ricoh CEO 
Tracey Rothenberger states:
Technology is moving very fast with the introduction of new devices 
every month, and we didn’t want to sit down and maintain a 
refresh strategy on something that was a personal decision for each 
employee. . . . We do not care what employees bring to work as long 
as they follow our corporate policies for usage of the device and 
protection of proprietary information. (Miller, 2012)
Mobile technology, especially BYOD, raises new ­problems 
that need to be resolved. These include security, software 

92 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
interoperability and data sharing, ownership and control, and 
who pays for what.
Security and Bring Your Own Technology (BYOT)
A related trend, bring your own technology (BYOT), is an extreme 
form of BYOD. It allows a user to bring his or her own device, soft-
ware, and usage patterns to the workplace. For example, BYOD 
allows employees to make their own selection of smart phones and/
or tablets, but IT and other stakeholders establish software and usage 
patterns. BYOT extends the BYOD concept by allowing employees 
to select their own software combinations in ways they feel enable 
them to perform their duties.
BYOT, like BYOD, is becoming more prevalent in organiza-
tions. This adds yet another element of complexity to IT because 
of the sheer distance from corporate-sponsored software. Each 
organization needs to decide whether they wish to take active 
measures to stop it, control it, or facilitate it.
Lost/Stolen Devices and Ex-Employees
An organization’s private data is its property, and is the “soul” of 
the business. Mobile devices may contain customer contact lists, 
technical data, and even sensitive material about the state of the 
business. Because of this, these devices pose a substantial threat in 
the wrong hands. A lost or stolen device could be used in fraud 
or corporate espionage. A personal device, owned by a former 
worker, could be the source of abuse should that worker try to 
leverage corporate information for his or her own benefit (e.g., 
a former employee using a client contact list to steal business  
for a competing company), or in retaliation for a perceived wrong 
(e.g., a disgruntled former employee publicly leaks sensitive infor-
mation to damage the organization).
Banks and financial institutions, faced with the risk of unman-
aged devices and their possible loss, are very concerned about 
finding a solution (Violino, 2012). They seem to be aware that 
this solution will have to evolve alongside the rapidly changing 
technology it addresses.

developing a mobile management strategy  93
Software and Information Homogeneity and Control
Organization efficiency requires that information technology staff 
standardize its software. This allows for effective training, usage 
guidelines, and cost control, compliance with licensing agree-
ments, support for contracts, maintaining interoperability, and 
data sharing. Mobile devices, living outside these standards, create 
a risk of destabilization of this regime.
First, mobile adds an additional layer of technology that IT 
must address. Second, it introduces hardware and software vari-
ability into the existing workspace, already pressed for people and 
expertise. Third, without controls, IT can no longer guarantee the 
completeness of company data. How do they know what is going 
on in those devices?
Consider the issue of malware prevention software. Not yet 
a major problem with mobile devices, it is only a matter of time 
before a major incident occurs that compromises a large multi-
national or public institution. IT departments are responsible to 
maintain information security; therefore, they will be on the hook 
for system disruptions or security breaches.
A great deal of investment has been made in selecting, imple-
menting, and optimizing corporate information systems. This 
investment has not only consisted of time and money, but in devel-
oping a vision that is closely tied to organizational goals. These 
goals originated from the top decision-makers. The idea that this 
order, which was hard to achieve, will suddenly fall because of the 
potential chaos of mobile technologies is about as welcome as a 
dam bursting in a rainstorm. With the arrival of mobile, both IT 
and executives will want to keep as much of their control structure 
as is possible.
Private Property, Corporate Property
In BYOD environments, mobile devices are often the property 
of workers, and this leads to conflicts when corporations wish to 
exercise control, at any level, over these devices. Another concern 
is that not all workers own mobile devices. Mandating ownership 
at the worker’s personal cost may be resented, and this would be 
a prickly issue in a unionized workplace. This is likely to be seen 

94 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
as an attempt at cost reduction by offloading business expenses 
to the employees. Attempting to enforce brand choices and/or 
control the device would inflame the situation.
Organizations can provide standardized devices to their 
workers, and this is an excellent solution for some businesses. 
Institutions and corporations requiring specialized security (gov-
ernment, research) or rugged devices (warehousing, manufactur-
ing) would likely follow this approach.
This is not so simple in other cases because it presents two 
problems. One, the organization may now incur the cost of a 
personal computer and a mobile device for each employee—
an expensive proposition. Two, people don’t want to carry two 
mobile devices (one for business and one for personal use); the 
extra bulk is contrary to the idea of mobile.
Once again, a company’s outside sales force provides a good 
example. They are highly mobile people who want to minimize 
the weight they carry, especially through airports, while maxi-
mizing their connectedness. Allowing limited personal use on a  
business-issued device is an option, but it’s not an ideal situation 
for either party.
The issue becomes even more complicated when information 
services are provided to partners, affiliates, and customers. An 
acceptable compromise between private ownership and corporate 
ownership must be found.
Circling the Wagons: Mobile Management  
Strategy
Because of the sudden increase in mobile technologies, there has 
been a sharp rise in the need for enterprise mobile device man-
agement (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM) 
as companies strive to maintain order in employee use of mobile 
technologies.
There is some confusion about the difference between the two 
types of technology management, but there doesn’t need to be. 
Just as it sounds, MDM is the setup, allocation, and support of 
the mobile devices used by the employees for company purposes, 
and MAM is the deployment, management, and support of the 
applications on the devices used by those same employees. That 
may sound overly simplistic, but misunderstandings are becoming 

developing a mobile management strategy  95
more prevalent as the two fields become bunged together. This 
problem is mostly the result of solution vendors who are selling 
products and services that offer a “one size fits all” combination 
of MDM and MAM. The issue is only going to become more com-
plicated when companies start selling mobile data management 
platforms.
Mobile device management provides a series of challenges. 
First, which mobile devices are employees going to use for their 
company activities? This doesn’t just pertain to mobile learning, 
but also to their email, alerts, calendaring, company intranet 
usage, and so on. Because MDM governs the device itself, it is con-
cerned with the activities of the entire device; it makes the device 
secure and controlled, but can be seen as intrusive. For example, 
MDM can prevent users from performing activities that are viewed 
as counterproductive, such as playing games or using Facebook. 
Device content can also be controlled. This is not an ethical solu-
tion when BYOD is mandated. Simply put, it’s bad form to try to 
manage devices when you don’t own them. MDM may also pres-
ent significant stumbling blocks when partners, affiliates, and cus-
tomers are involved; they may be opposed to an IT department 
viewing or having access to their data.
If employees use devices that they personally own, the enter-
prise will need to determine the right balance for the employee 
between company and personal usage. If a company does follow 
the BYOD model, the devices can be smartly provisioned to make 
it easier for the user to separate business and pleasure. BYOD 
does make life easier for end-users because they are comfortable 
on their own devices, but it creates challenges for IT because it is 
harder to support the variety of devices that result. BYOD can also 
have a bearing on your application development as apps will have 
to be designed for many different devices and operating systems, 
which can mean a substantial amount of development time.
The other alternative is for the enterprise to purchase and 
equip all the employees who will participate in mobile learning 
with identical mobile devices, an approach sometimes called “cor-
porate liable.” Obviously, there is an expense involved for this 
approach, but it also allows for much greater control, as all users 
will have the same device with the same OS and have access to the 
same applications. IT will also be able to build layers of security 
that function the same across the entire audience and that make 

96 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
the devices safer and more secure. All of the devices, no matter 
what the make, will have a specific ID number. For instance, Apple 
devices have a UDID number that allows for management and 
security to be device-specific. All devices have unique identifi-
ers of some sort, whether a serial number, IMEI, or some other  
manufacturer-specific number.
Mobile Device Management Strategy
Mobile device management is primarily intended to fulfill a secu-
rity role (Murray, 2012). In the event of a lost/stolen device, or 
should an employee leave the company, the mobile device can be 
blocked, locked, or erased to protect organizational information. 
It also allows IT staff to administer mobile devices in a manner 
similar to PCs in order to maximize standardization, minimize 
downtime due to problems, and enforce usage policy. Functions 
include application installations, firmware and software upgrades, 
scheduled backups, remote diagnostics, device history logging, 
and policy enforcement.
BlackBerry Enterprise Server is an example of an MDM solu-
tion designed to provision, audit, and protect smart phones and 
tablets through a centralized administrative interface. Their newer 
product, BlackBerry Fusion, is intended to work in a BYOD envi-
ronment and supports BlackBerry, iOS and Android devices. With 
Fusion, there is limited allowance through a component called 
BlackBerry Balance to separate personal and business informa-
tion. This is biased toward the protection of corporate data, is only 
available on Playbook 2.0 and enabled BlackBerry smart phones, 
including the Blackberry 10, and is optional. There are many 
other MDM providers, particularly for iOS devices. Examples 
include AirWatch, BoxTone, MobileIron, and Good Technology, 
to name just a few.
Mobile Application Management Strategy
We are used to going to an app store and downloading an app 
for free or for a small fee. But do you want your employees to be 
going to the Apple App Store or Google Play for their company 
mlearning? Probably not. Some vendor solutions are available 
that allow you to set up your own app store that has your own 

developing a mobile management strategy  97
branding. This is a big plus for those enterprises that have spent 
a lot of time and money building a company “university” identity. 
Your development team and IT work together to set up the store, 
and your learners simply tap the store icon to retrieve their apps. 
The whole process works the same as the retail app stores, but this 
store is the company’s and gives the needed security and man-
agement options. The ease of downloading gives your learners a 
positive user experience, which is important, especially on your 
first rollout of mlearning.
Good mobile application management demands other 
requirements so your learners have access to the best and current 
versions of apps. You will want to push notifications to let them 
know when a new iteration of an app is available with new content 
or bug and security fixes. They’ll also need to know when a totally 
new app is available.
Your application management will help in other areas, such 
as security and metrics. There is greater control over the apps, as 
it becomes possible to disable and even wipe an app remotely if 
something appears wrong in the authentication of the user or the 
device. Mobile apps can actually be more secure than e-learning, 
and that will be good news for executive management and the IT 
department.
It’s also important knowing who specifically is using your 
app. Mobile application management will give you helpful met-
rics, such as who is downloading the app, whether the app has 
launched, how many times it is used, and other critical measures 
of effectiveness. If you have goals related to your mobile learning, 
such as ROI, these metrics can be extremely beneficial to building 
an mlearning success story.
Mobile application management (MAM) is a strategy based 
on governing specific mobile applications deployed on a device, 
not the device itself. The functions are similar to MDM, but less 
intrusive on the user’s private space. Because MAM is not con-
cerned with what is globally occurring within the mobile device, 
it is well adapted for a BYOD environment when property and 
privacy rights are to be respected.
MAM does not have all of the capabilities of MDM, because it 
functions at the application level. This may be an issue if a com-
pany wants to enforce usage policies and device wide audits. MDM 
and MAM are not necessarily exclusive and may complement 

98 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
one another in some workplaces, but they are quite redundant  
(Faas, 2012).
MAM typically controls distribution and upgrading through 
a distribution API or an enterprise app store. Security can be 
applied to individual apps through MAM, whether an MDM solu-
tion is employed or not, and can protect against breaches or viola-
tions of policy. There are three basic approaches:
	 1.	 Using a MAM SDK: This requires recoding apps to commu-
nicate with an administrative server, a process that requires 
additional resources and therefore restricts apps to corpo-
rate selections (Gruman, 2011). App updates may present 
additional problems, as IT will need to rebuild new versions 
for each distribution. This is a very customizable solution 
and may be well suited to organizations that build their own 
custom apps. An example of an SDK solution provider is 
AirWatch.
	 2.	 Containers: This approach requires IT to fit the app into 
a security “container” within the device, where all of the 
contents are subject to a predetermined security paradigm, 
including access and encryption (Faas, 2012). Container 
contents can be selectively wiped by IT, when necessary. This 
is not very customizable, but can be simpler and easier to 
maintain. As an example, Accelian uses a container in its 
mobile management solution.
	 3.	 Cloud and Middleware Solutions: Some solutions are able to 
work with existing apps, without changing their source 
code or using a container, by relying on the cloud and 
middleware. When data and sensitive services reside in 
the cloud, middleware can be employed to create device 
transparency for IT and solutions developers, as well as 
handle many security issues. This higher degree of flexi-
bility may prove very useful when BYOT is permitted. The 
additional layers may prove problematic, particularly in 
isolating support issues. An example of a product using this 
approach is Apperian’s EASE product. (Disclosure: Float 
Mobile Learning, where the authors work, is a partner with 
Apperian.)

developing a mobile management strategy  99
Making a Decision
In response to BYOD and BYOT conflicts, perhaps an organiza-
tion would be in the position of greatest advantage to offer a sti-
pend for mobile users to accommodate some of the mobile device 
costs. This is not a perfect solution and not everyone will be happy 
with it; however, it would allow the organization and worker to 
treat the mobile device as a “shared space.”
MDM is a good choice for devices that demand high-security 
features or complete uniformity. It is also a good choice for issued 
devices when it need not concern itself with a user’s personal data. 
Quite simply, personal usage is not the organization’s responsibil-
ity; personal usage may even be against policy, and MDM can help 
enforce this.
MAM may be a better choice in many cases. In a BYOD 
setting, the corporate information is still protected without 
compromising privacy and property rights. It is also worth con-
sidering that mobile devices free the users and allow them to 
perform their jobs in creative and effective ways. There are many 
innovation opportunities for mobile devices, and the number of 
apps available for mobile users is steadily increasing; excessive 
control can defeat this advantage (Murray, 2012). For an orga-
nization wanting to leverage this advantage, an approach using 
containers or the cloud-and-middleware combination may be 
the better option.
In spite of all that we have said about mobile device manage-
ment and mobile application management, the first step is to 
build an overall mobile learning strategy for your specific needs. 
You won’t be able to make an informed decision about MDM or 
MAM until you know what requirements you have that are unique 
to your enterprise. A vendor solution might be just right, or a cus-
tom solution might be in order. Be careful of being shoehorned 
into a solution that makes you compromise on your priorities.

Change Management 
Strategies for Mobile Learning
Scott McCormick
It’s not easy instituting change in any organization. There are a 
lot of expectations placed upon you, and some of them can be 
unrealistic if people are uninformed. Although you’ll be a hero 
if the change brings success, you are also out front to take any of 
the arrows. If you have stepped up or been given the charge to 
evaluate or implement mlearning in your company, you are going 
to bring about change. But that doesn’t mean it has to be a stress-
ful or daunting experience. There are some steps you can take to 
be well equipped and smartly positioned to assure that you are 
headed down the right path and prepared for the challenges that 
come with any new endeavor.
By educating yourself on the characteristics, benefits, and 
challenges of mlearning, you will be able to determine how your 
company or organization can best use this form of learning. In 
addition, you will be positioning yourself to develop a business 
case for mlearning and be prepared to answer the inevitable 
questions that will arise as you work to institute a change in 
how people think and work. Here are the key steps you should 
be taking.

102    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Immerse Yourself in the Field
You will need to take off your water wings and jump into the deep 
end. If you are going to be the point person for mlearning, you’d 
better understand it to a depth that you can have informed con-
versations and answer most of the questions that will be thrown 
at you. Start frequenting mlearning blogs and participate in the 
conversations. Use the comments section to ask questions, give 
your opinions, and let others know you are out there and want to 
collaborate. Follow mlearning colleagues on Twitter by using the 
hash tag #mlearning. Many tweets and retweets will catch your eye 
with links to interesting articles, blog posts, and statistical infor-
mation. You can attend mlearning conferences and gatherings of 
associations in your area. Begin to connect with other people in 
the mobile learning field on sites such as LinkedIn and build your 
network. All of these activities should have a ripple effect on your 
knowledge capital and visibility in the field.
But you need to be active. You can’t just add your name in 
a couple of places and sit back and wait. Go to the world; don’t 
expect the world to come to you. If you become active, you will 
have more information and connections than you know what to 
do with. It can be helpful to persuade a colleague in your organi-
zation to get involved, too.
Start Using Your Own Mobile Device—A Lot
That may sound like funny advice, but how much of your device 
do you actually use? If someone asked you to input a custom 
URL into your mobile browser, could you do it? Could you 
change your Wi-Fi settings or pair your device to a new Bluetooth 
speaker? Could you scan a QR code if you were asked to? Today’s 
handheld units have so many features that you’ll be amazed at 
the power you have been carrying around with you. Download 
applications that are applicable to your daily needs, and even 
some that are not. How about a kid’s game or a game you play 
against someone else at a distance? What about an app that uses 
features like push technology, GPS (Google Maps), augmented 
reality software such as Layar or Aurasma, or alerts? How about 
fitness tracking apps or photo sharing communities? When you 

change management strategies for mobile learning    103
take your next business trip, do as much as you can on your 
mobile device: book a cab or rent a car, schedule meetings, find 
a restaurant and make a reservation (try going to OpenTable.
com or Yelp.com on your smart phone and see what happens), 
or check your flight status. Listen to an Internet radio station 
(Pandora, iTunes Radio) while you are waiting for your plane. 
The best part about this advice is that it won’t bust your budget. 
Most apps are cheap or even free (just watch your data consump-
tion if you are not on an unlimited plan). Also, don’t just limit 
yourself to smart phone apps, try some SMS (text messaging) 
applications, such as getting Redbox updates, local restaurant 
deals, or weather.com.
Another interesting element of the app stores is that every app 
has its own usability group in the reviews section. Go ahead and 
try this: search for an app that you want to download and then 
read the reviews. What do people like and dislike? What works and 
what bombs?
The more you become familiar with the capabilities of your 
own device and the devices your colleagues are carrying, the more 
ideas you will have about how mobile learning can best be used 
by your organization. It is hard to find uses for a tool if you don’t 
know all it can do.
Do Some Informal Polling
Let’s face it: you are going to become the company evangelist for 
mlearning. You are going to have to walk the walk, and talk the talk, 
among your colleagues. You need to learn what kind of reception 
your new initiative will receive. As you interact with your co-work-
ers in the hallway, at lunch, before and after meetings, get a feel 
for their attitudes and perspectives about mobile content delivery. 
Here are some questions you can try: “What kind of phone do you 
have?” “What OS version is it running?” “What do you like or not 
like about it?” “What are your favorite apps?” “Do you text mes-
sage a lot?” “Hey, you know those compliance courses we all have 
to take? What would you think if you could take parts of those on 
your smart phone?”
Every once in a while, we have a “Lunch and Learn” where one 
of our employees gives a presentation about a topical subject or 

104    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
new piece of cool technology and everyone brings lunch into the 
conference room (sometimes we buy to help entice participants). 
Try one of those with your group and give a fun and informative 
talk about mlearning.
There’s obviously a lot to do if you are going to be the 
front-runner of change in your company or organization regard-
ing mlearning. But you can be much better prepared to lead that 
change if you take these steps at the beginning of your journey.

Categories of Mobile Learning 
Content
Gary Woodill and Chad Udell
While it is a good idea to ensure that your employees carry mobile 
devices at work, what about the “mobile content” that goes on them? 
The current concept of content comes to us from the “instructionist 
model” of mobile learning, that is, the approach based on classroom 
metaphors or presentations of “learning materials” and testing.
But content for learning can be almost anything, including 
web pages that were not specifically designed for education and 
training, access to databases of information of interest to the per-
son who is asking for it, or any online mobile experiences that we 
can learn from. Content can also be “real-life experiences,” where 
mobile devices are used to augment the information in the phys-
ical environment, or where mobile devices are used to store and 
transmit information that the user wants to save or send to others.
Keeping these distinctions in mind, what most people mean 
by mobile content is what appears on the screens of users when 
they connect to specific learning materials that are designed for 
their use. As we shall see, it goes way beyond that.
There are many ways to slice and dice the types of mobile 
learning content. One way is by starting with the simplest kind of 
messaging and moving to the most complex:
•• One-way text-based messages: examples include SMS text mes-
sages and email. Almost from the beginning, mobile phones 

108    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
have been able to send simple text messages of up to 160 
characters through a function called “short message service” 
(SMS). This is the facility that is being used when people 
“text” each other. Texting can still be used to send short 
messages of educational value to learners on demand. Also, 
text-based learning games have been developed or text mes-
sages can be used as additional information (such as provid-
ing clues) for real-life games. For longer messages, email to 
mobile devices also can work well, although it doesn’t seem to 
have the immediacy of texting.
•• Bi-directional text and data messages: examples include text chat, 
surveys, tests, and mobile data collection. The next level of com-
plexity for messages is two-way communications. In addition to 
receiving information, mobile devices are capable of sending 
back information to a database, to an instructor, or to a learn-
er’s peers. There are educational uses of live chat and mobile 
methods of gathering information for research purposes, such 
as surveys, polls, and other forms of mobile data collection.
•• Voice-based content and/or responses: examples include synchronous 
calls and broadcast messages. Of course, we should never forget 
that mobile phones are first and foremost voice-based communi-
cations devices. That means we can use them to speak with peo-
ple or to send spoken messages. Mobile devices can also be used 
to record podcasts for learners that can be listened to at will.
•• Presentation materials: examples include instructor-designed 
learning materials that are often in the form of slides, graphics, 
or animations. This type of mobile learning content is probably 
closest to the model of e-learning that has developed over the 
past ten years. Here, successive screens of information are pre-
sented to learners in the form of courses or learning modules. 
Often, a test follows these presentations to show that the infor-
mation has been retained at least until the test is finished.
•• Just-in-time information to be searched and retrieved: examples 
include database content and web pages. Vast stores of infor-
mation can be accessed via a mobile device. The real problem 
is finding the right information when the mobile learner 
wants it. This problem is being solved through sophisticated 
algorithms and tagging procedures that are starting to build 
semantic intelligence in mobile networks so that information 

categories of mobile learning content    109
can be more easily found. The concept of just-in-time infor-
mation has its primary application in supporting the perfor-
mances of individuals and groups.
•• Rich media: examples include asynchronous, animated audio 
and video productions that can be downloaded or streamed to 
a mobile device. With the development of large storage banks 
for video and audio on the Internet, we’ve seen a huge increase 
in the availability of educational animation, audio, and video. In 
addition to rich media that are specifically produced for educa-
tional purposes, we now have vast amounts of lecture material 
and conference presentations available to mobile users. With 
the increasing capabilities of mobile devices to record and edit 
rich media productions, we’re also seeing a huge increase in the 
amount of user-generated content available in this form.
•• Interactive and immersive media: examples include games, VR, 
AR, and interactive apps. An additional level of complexity is 
to add interactivity and immersion, along with rich media, to 
produce educational games, virtual reality, augmented reality, 
and other forms of interactive applications. Many productions 
at this level are in the form of downloadable apps, proprietary 
programs that run with specific mobile operating systems, or 
cross-platform applications that are available on any mobile 
device (such as those authored in HTML5).
•• Collective/collaborative experiences: examples include “flash mob” 
instructions, collaborative learning projects, and social move-
ments supported by social media. Mobile content is aimed at 
groups rather than individuals. Examples include instructions 
for group actions such as meetings of flash mobs, mobile col-
laborative learning projects, and large-scale social movements 
that have developed as a result of users meeting in coordinat-
ing their actions using mobile devices.
Each of the above types of content requires different methods of 
authoring and production. Some forms of mobile production can be 
created by tools that come with mobile devices, while others require 
additional sophisticated hardware and software. For you as an 
instructional designer working with mobile learning, all of the above 
types of content should be considered in your strategic planning for 
the implementation of mobile learning in your organization.

Unique Affordances of Mobile 
Learning
Gary Woodill
The concept of an affordance was first coined by psychologist 
James J. Gibson in his 1977 article, “The Theory of Affordances,” 
and in his 1979 book, The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception. 
Essentially, an affordance is a quality or feature of an object, or of 
an environment, that allows an individual to perform an action. 
For example, the handles on a teacup allow it to be lifted without 
burning one’s hand. This is a key affordance of a teacup. The 
speakers on a home theatre system allow us to hear high-fidelity 
sound. This is a key affordance of those speakers.
All learning technologies have a set of affordances that makes 
some actions possible while limiting others. If we look at three 
different learning technologies—a physical classroom, self-paced 
e-learning, and mobile learning—we can immediately see that the 
actions of both teachers and learners are enabled, shaped, and 
also limited, by the features of each of these technologies. Table 
15.1 shows some of the differences (and similarities) among these 
three learning technologies.
Several writers have pointed out that when a new technology 
is introduced, the first impulse that many of us have is to apply 
the same methods and content we have been using to the new 
technology. As Marshall McLuhan noted, “We look at the present 

112    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
through a rear-view mirror. We march backwards into the future” 
(McLuhan & Fiore, 1967).
In the case of mobile learning, this tendency is reflected in 
the early applications for mobile learning, which included tradi-
tional instructional uses such as the delivery of courses, lectures, 
video, and notes; use of devices as personal organizers by both stu-
dents and instructors; provision of assessments on mobile devices, 
especially multiple-choice questions; and attempts to make mobile 
devices terminals for collecting data for learning management sys-
tems. All of these uses of mobile technology are based on a 250-year-
old classroom instruction methodology.
In order to do things differently, we need to understand the 
unique affordances of mobile devices. In 2013, the U.S. Department 
of Defence’s ADL group issued a report on their MoTIF Project that 
included an inventory of “capabilities of mobile devices,” a similar 
concept to affordances. If we broaden the concept of capabilities to 
include features of mobile environments and look for additional fea-
tures of mobile devices, we can see that there are at least twenty-five 
possible affordances of mobile devices, as shown in the list below:

Detailed suggestions on how to use a number of these affor-

by Chad Udell. I’m sure there are other affordances of mobile 
devices and environments that can be identified and discussed in 
terms of their usefulness in learning and development. The future 
will also bring new functionality that we haven’t even thought 
about to the mobile world. As technology evolves and costs to 
bring advanced features and sensors to devices decrease, hard-
ware will gain functionality currently impossible. Let’s briefly look 

114    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
at each of the above affordances to see how each might be used in 
learning and development.
Camera(s)
One of the big shifts with mobile learning is the fact that people 
both enjoy and learn from making their own personal audiovisual 
productions. Many people then post these images and videos to sites 
like Instagram, Vine, YouTube, and Flickr. Some people, known as 
LifeLoggers or LifeBloggers, even wear cameras twenty-four hours 
a day seven days a week, capturing every aspect of their lives. Others 
are now using mobile equipment, such as Google Glass, to provide 
a first-person point of view on the world in which they are mov-
ing. This facility can be used in training for recording actions and 
words for later critique by supervisors or trainers, or could even 
be broadcast live over the Internet, with instant feedback coming 
from the person who is observing at a distance. First-person point 
of view (POV) telepresence is now possible with wearable comput-
ers containing the right optical and networking capabilities.
Cameras are also at the core of “augmented reality,” a tech-
nology that adds text and/or virtual objects to the scene or object 
that the camera is focused on. Augmented reality is in its infancy, 
but has huge potential for training and development by providing 
supplemental information for any scene.
Cameras and mobile devices are also used to capture and 
interpret Quick Response (QR) codes, which can then provide 
additional information about a particular object or environment, 
including instructions on how to operate or understand a piece 
of equipment.
Clocks
Virtually all mobile devices have a built-in clock that can be used 
for telling the time (converted to any time zone), as well as used as 
a timing device for events or recordings. Clocks are integral to the 
provision of alerts, alarms, and triggers, which can all be used in 
the development of educational activities. Content and activities 
can be altered, allowed, or disallowed based on this vital aspect of 
use context. And, of course, the clock in mobile devices can be 
used for teaching time.

unique affordances of mobile learning    115
Cloud Storage
The provision of huge banks of servers by large providers like 
Amazon, Google, and Microsoft has led to the concept of “cloud” 
storage and programming. The cloud metaphor simply means that 
this vast resource is available from anywhere, one of the technolo-
gies that make modern mobile learning possible. Information can 
be stored anywhere. You rarely know the actual physical location 
or the source of the information that you are receiving. Because 
of the cloud, the cost of digital storage is virtually nothing, which 
is why many services give up to a terabyte in the cloud for free. 
Cloud storage is one of the unique affordances that makes mobile 
learning possible, available anywhere, any time.
Computing Functions/Apps
Mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets are full-scale 
computers in their own right. In fact, a typical smart phone is 
ten to fifteen times faster than the Cray 1 supercomputer of 1979 
(Croucher, 2010). The iPad 2 is about as powerful as the Cray 
2 supercomputer, the world’s fastest computer in 1985 (Markoff, 
2011). Because of this power, and the mature and robust software 
development kits (SDKs) available for these platforms, mobile 
devices can be programmed to do almost anything within imag-
ination. The number of programs for mobile devices, known as 
apps, has exploded, with over two million apps available in the 
Apple iPhone App Store and Google Play. While many of these 
apps are not applicable to enterprise learning and development, a 
large number are useful for mobile learning of any kind, ranging 
from support for school curricula to enterprise training and pro-
fessional continuing education.
Of course, mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets 
already have built-in computer functions, such as calculators, data-
bases, memory, and the ability to be programmed locally. At this 
stage of the development of mobile learning, you really need to be 
a programmer to produce anything significant, but drag-and-drop 
programming for non-technical people is already in the prototype 
stage and will be available shortly for production-ready deployment.
With the advent of “big data,” there is talk of “machine learning” 
in addition to using mobile devices for training and development. 

116    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Machine learning refers to the ability of mobile devices to process 
large amounts of data in order to discover relationships that pre-
viously were unknown. As mobile devices become faster and more 
powerful, knowledge will be developed in real time, and decisions 
will be made or relevant information provided as events happen. 
This cloud-based computing largely takes place outside of mobile 
devices themselves, but contextual data from mobile devices and/
or user input can be used in such calculations and push new or 
different output to users in the field as circumstances change.
Most importantly, mobile devices as computers are being 
used to augment human memory and thinking abilities. As Clive 
Thompson (2013) has argued in his recent book, Smarter Than 
You Think, “hybrid thinking” using the unique abilities of humans 
combined with the unique abilities of computers will become 
more powerful in the near future than the use of human experts 
or computers by themselves. Basically, we are all “smarter” with 
mobile devices at hand, giving us immense computing power, and 
the entire Internet in our pockets.
Document Production and Viewing
Most mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets are equipped 
with keyboards and have some word processing software available 
for them so that they can be used in both document production 
and document viewing. Text still remains a primary way of com-
munication and delivery of knowledge, and most mobile devices 
support this method of communication. Text-based materials 
come in many forms, such as e-books, PDF files, chat rooms, SMS 
messaging, other messaging systems like Snapchat and WhatsApp, 
and mobile websites. Mobile makes these texts available from 
anyplace, anywhere, at the “point of need.” While the nature of 
reading has changed, the amount of reading in the world has not 
declined.
Embodiment
Embodiment of mobile devices, whether swallowed, attached 
to parts of the nervous system, sensed through brain waves, or 
placed on or under the skin, are all in the testing phase of devel-
opment. Right now, Motorola’s research division has announced 

unique affordances of mobile learning    117
a prototype indigestible pill that transforms your body into an 
authentication passcode transmitter by broadcasting information 
from your stomach. Perhaps less radical than that idea is the use 
of a temporary password tattoo. Also, stretchable circuits can be 
used for skullcaps to detect concussions in sports, or baby ther-
mometers can be attached to the skin in order to track an infant’s 
vital signs. Other embodiment technologies that can be built into 
mobile devices include eye tracking, voice recognition, and fin-
gerprint identification. While many of these technologies are not 
ready to ship soon, these developments indicate the direction of 
embodied mobile technologies.
External Sensors
While internal sensors in mobile devices detect movement and 
location of the device itself, there’s no reason why external sen-
sors cannot be hooked up to a smart phone or tablet. If this hap-
pens, we all can become nomadic monitors, gathering data as we 
move through the world. This possibility was discussed about five 
years ago in the Economist magazine, in a report called “A World of 
Witnesses.” At that time, there were already prototypes of the con-
cept working in the world and, since then, more examples have 
been developed.
One area for future growth is to equip mobile devices with 
“sniffing” capabilities, which can be activated automatically and 
without user command. The Economist wrote in 2008 that:
. . . researchers at America’s Purdue University reported that  
they are building a system for the state of Indiana designed to  
use a network of mobile phones to detect and track radiation.  
In the event of a nuclear leak or a “dirty bomb,” the sensors of 
large numbers of phones, all identifying their location through  
the global-positioning system (GPS), would point authorities  
to the source of the radiation.
Such tracking systems rely on the collective information from 
large numbers of phones, whose owners may not even be aware 
of the part they are playing in this. If, say, a car is carrying a dirty 
bomb and driving down a street, it passes other cars. The mobile 
phones inside those passing cars would send information to a 

118    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
database. The signal would grow weaker as the distance from the 
source increased, whereas the signal from phones in approaching 
cars would grow stronger. The software would then use the sum of 
this information to pinpoint the bomb.
In the same article, The Economist suggested that mobile 
devices could be attached to taxicabs that move around a city, 
automatically sniffing out problems and reporting on environ-
mental data. Carbon monoxide levels, amounts of ozone, pollen 
count, intensity of ultraviolet rays, ambient noise, and tempera-
ture or barometric readings are relatively easy to detect by sensors 
in mobile phones in such a way that users would not even notice, 
or they could be used for alerts to hidden dangers. External sen-
sors can build a profile of our immediate environment and show 
it to us in a visualization that helps us to understand the world we 
are living in.
Geospatial Data
One of the major differences between mobile learning and 
e-learning is the use of geospatial data, including the user’s loca-
tion, orientation, and movements in the space and relevant phys-
ical information about the features of the environment in which 
the user is located.
Specifically, geospatial data from mobile phones and tab-
lets are emerging as a special kind of data that link many other 
kinds of information together, integrating them into a holistic 
view of what a person is doing or has done. This built-in feature 
of many mobile devices—the generation of geospatial data—is 
transforming learning in ways we are just starting to imagine. In 
2012, Jeff Jonas, distinguished engineer and chief scientist for 
IBM’s Entity Analytics group, described geospatial data as “ana-
lytic superfood.” “Geospatial data,” he said, “is going to rip the 
lid off what’s computable” (Jonas, 2012). It is the basis of what is 
served up in augmented reality and provides much of the con-
text that can be used to determine what information is relevant 
to the user.
Already, educational uses of geospatial data include map-
ping and navigation, games like geocaching, and apps that use 
geofencing to restrict access to files unless a person is at a specific 
geographical location.

unique affordances of mobile learning    119
Individual Addressability
Each mobile device has a unique phone number or other address-
able messaging identifier and, usually, is owned by a single individ-
ual. As well, most individuals have their own email addresses. Both 
mean that, while on the move, a specific individual can be located 
and communicated with as needed. Each individual can call (or 
be called), regardless of his or her actual location. In a traditional 
landline system, we “come to the phone.” With mobile, the excuse 
of not being near a phone is not available as a reason for not 
answering a call. As Ling and Donner (2009) explain:
Having a mobile phone—along with caller ID and voicemail and 
texting functionality—means that we can call or text directly to the 
individual. If we are “indisposed” at the moment, we can still see 
who is calling and make a snap decision as to whether we should 
enter indisposition in order to take the call or simply send it to our 
voicemail account. The problem is even easier with texting, which 
is by its nature asynchronous. . . . The mobile phone puts each of 
us into play. We are remotely accessible to others . . . whenever and 
wherever [we] happen to be.
There are several implications of the availability of individual 
addressability. There is an interlacing of mediated and co-present 
activities, for example, we can be reading text messages while we 
are listening to someone speak to us in the same room. Throughout 
the day, we can maintain a unique “connected presence” with fam-
ily and friends, communicating at a moment’s notice.
From an educational point of view, individual addressabil-
ity makes the personalization of content possible, both by being 
made available to a learner and by being tracked to evaluate 
learner engagement and responses to specific learning materials.
Input/Output Peripherals
If we think of smart phones and tablets as small computers, then 
it makes sense that a number of mobile peripherals can be added 
to them for increased functionality. Small peripherals that can 
be added include card readers, tiny printers, miniature speakers, 
micro projectors, and small scanners—both 2D and 3D. While 
learning uses for these peripherals have yet to be developed, it 

120    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
is important to think about them when planning new and inno-
vative uses for mobile learning. How could you connect existing 
sensors, tools, and other work aids to your mobile devices to better 
inform your workers?
Internal Sensors
Most smart phones and tablets have internal sensors that cal-
culate the position, orientation, and movement of the device 
itself. The sensors include an accelerometer, a compass, gyro-
scope, and connections to a global positioning system (GPS). 
Because of the sensors, the software in the device can detect 
the location of the device and what the cameras of the device 
are pointing at. This capability has all sorts of uses in learning, 
including augmented reality, simulations, gesture recognition, 
and navigational guidance.
Internet Connectivity/Search
Almost all mobile phones and tablets being sold today have a 
mobile browser that connects to the Internet and World Wide 
Web. From any location, provided the user is connected to a 
mobile network, searches can be undertaken on any topic. For 
those users who subscribe to social media, social search can be 
used to ask other users for information. From a pedagogical point 
of view, mobile devices lend themselves to quick reference mate-
rial, inquiry-based learning approaches, and learning at the “point 
of need” when an immediate answer is required.
Media Viewer/Playback Function
Nearly all mobile communications devices today include media 
viewers and playback functionality, in order to see and hear 
images, animations, video, and audio. Early forms of mobile 
learning included the creation of “podcasts,” although this ter-
minology is now fading as the ability to create and provide video 
and audio experiences is taken for granted. The field of mobile 
learning is moving into “multi-screen experiences,” whereby the 
user moves freely among a variety of screens (such as phones, 
tablets, monitors, and televisions) and audio playback devices 

unique affordances of mobile learning    121
while software keeps track of where the user is in order to main-
tain continuity. Also, the quality of video and audio is improving 
with new generations of devices, enhancing the user experience 
and making it more realistic.
Memory
Mobile smart phones and tablets are devices for augmenting 
human memory, allowing data capture and storage. The amount 
of memory available in a mobile device is steadily increasing so 
that now it is not uncommon to have several gigabytes available 
in your mobile device. Vastly increased memory (or connections 
to miniature hard drives) is necessary if mobile devices are being 
used in a continuous 24/7 fashion to record all aspects of a user’s 
life. The memory functions of mobile devices can be used for sur-
veillance whereby authorities or organizations collect and analyze 
information about citizens, but they can also be used for “sousveil-
lance” whereby citizens capture and store activities of agents of 
the state or corporations.
Having large memory capacity and increasingly faster chips 
allows for “brute force computing” and “machine learning,” 
wherein large sums of data are analyzed on the fly for near real-
time decision making. More likely, mobile devices with greatly 
increased capacities will be paired with human decision making, 
creating a form of “hybrid thinking” that utilizes the strengths of 
humans combined with machines (Thompson, 2013).
Messaging
Text and multimedia messaging have been built into mobile 
phones almost from the beginning. Short message service 
(SMS)—also known as “texting”—is very close to a universal 
medium for receiving questions from users and sending imme-
diate responses. This is being used in a number of ways for 
teaching, including homework support from schools and uni-
versities, after-hospitalization care for patients who have been 
discharged, alerts to students on campus, and informational 
support for pregnant women and new mothers. Messaging in 
the form of chat applications and social media is also increas-
ingly playing a role in learning and development.

Most mobile phones and tablets have a microphone and include 
built-in applications for sound recording. Sound input can be 
used in a number of ways in learning apps. It can be used to iden-
tify a specific soundscape, a particular piece of music, or a voice. 
These capabilities can then be used as input for additional pro-
grams, such as the ability to play musical instruments on a mobile 
device. Text to speech and speech to text are powerful technolo-
gies to both leverage existing content in new ways and to generate 
new learning content.
Microprojection
Microprojection is an emerging capability of mobile devices and 
is related to the concept of “surface computing.” Micro projec-
tors can be built into a smart phone or tablet, or can be small 
external peripherals. They can project images onto any surface 
for instant presentations. Prototypes of micro projectors used to 
add video to print newspapers have already been developed. As 
recent research at MIT has shown (Mistry, 2009), when images are 
projected onto a user’s hands, the results can be used in gesture 
detection. All these possibilities are in development at the present 
time and will be available within the next five years.
Networking
While networking is not unique to mobile computing, the fact 
that users can remain connected to the network while moving 
around is a unique affordance. This means that social media can 
be used to connect two or more users and for the development, 
coordination, and collaboration of mobile communities. Because 
of the individual addressability of each mobile device, specific 
people can be contacted at will through the mobile network, at 
any time and wherever they may be located.
Many users value their mobile devices because of their ability 
to keep users connected with each other. Texting and chat are 
widely used to keep in touch, and the loss of the ability to connect 
to others can lead to emotional upset.

Notifications and Alerts
Most smart phones and tablets have built-in clocks that allow 
alerts and notifications when appropriate. These alerts may be 
in the form of sound signals, flashing LED lights, or vibration. 
Prototypes have also been developed to have mobile phones 
change their shapes or shift their weight to one side or another as 
signals. These capabilities can be used in educational games or in 
teaching users navigation and way-finding skills. Notifications can 
also be used in “proximity detection” to indicate when a user is 
near a specified object or person.
Portability/Mobility
The portability of mobile devices makes mobile learning possi-
ble. While the term “portable” has a long history in computing, 
calling something mobile simply means that a person can carry 
it continuously, ready for use when needed. The portability of 
mobile devices has been made possible by the miniaturization  
of electronic components and new manufacturing techniques that 
have allowed this shrinkage of devices while increasing their func-
tionality and power. The concept of portable is changing to a con-
cept of “unconsciously mobile”—meaning that the user doesn’t 
even consider whether to take the device along. He or she simply 
does. The fact that most mobile devices today are attached to a 
person’s belt or can be carried in a pocket or purse means that 
mobile learning is truly ubiquitous. Future developments include 
even smaller devices, the modularization of distinct components 
of mobile computing, wearable and embodied electronic devices, 
and developments in nanotechnology.
Short-Range Communications
Short-range communication abilities of mobile devices are used 
to connect with nearby peripherals, such as printers, keyboards, 
mice, scanners, and headsets. A variety of methods are available 
for short-range communication with mobile devices, including 
Bluetooth, radio frequency identification tags (RFID), near field 
communications (NFC), infrared beams, and Wi-Fi connections. 

124    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
This also allows for unique shared group experiences simply 
impossible before; one can now share audio, video, photos, and 
documents seamlessly via mobile applications and communica-
tions like iOS’s built-in AirPlay and AirDrop functionality.
Touchscreens
Almost every smart phone or tablet purchased today is equipped 
with a multi-touch screen that is used to control and interact with 
the device. Because they are multi-touch, more than one finger 
can be used to control and interact with what is on the screen. 
This enables new applications based on gestures or stylus use. 
Some multi-touch screens even measure pressure on the screen 
that can be used in haptics-based learning applications.
Ubiquity
Mark Weiser (1991) articulated a vision for ubiquitous comput-
ing in the early 1990s. Ubiquitous computing is already here, 
seen by the fact that a majority of people in developed countries 
have mobile devices available to them at all times. As electronics 
become wearable and are embedded in human bodies and into 
appliances, tools, and other objects (the “Internet of Things”), 
mobile learning will become even more ubiquitous. The vision, 
which has almost been achieved, is to have the ability to pull infor-
mation from any location at any time, as well as to be able to send 
information back into a network. Ubiquity also denotes the fact 
that mobile technologies become “invisible” as they meld into the 
everyday world.
Voice/Phone Communications
Because of the variety of things that can be done using a smart 
phone or tablet, there’s a tendency to forget that mobile phones 
were originally designed for voice phone calls. In fact, the acronym 
for ordinary landline use of telephones is “plain old telephone 
service” or POTS. Of course, voice communication using mobile 
devices now uses a variety of technologies, including voice over 
IP (VoIP) and various forms of online calling or conferencing, 

unique affordances of mobile learning    125
such as the services offered by Skype, Adobe Connect, Google+, 
WebEx, and many others.
Wearability
Mobile learning through wearable technologies is just taking off, 
in spite of the fact that it has been around since the 1980s. As men-
tioned earlier, mobile learning has become ubiquitous because of 
the fact that mobile phones are generally worn or carried on one’s 
person at all times. In addition to “belt wear,” we are increasingly  
seeing mobile devices being attached to people’s wrists, inte-
grated with their glasses, pinned to their clothing, worn as hats,  
built into their underwear, or used as jewelry. Multiple wearable 
devices can be connected to a “body area network” (BAN). A BAN 
can store data and be coordinated through a mobile phone or 
other miniature computing device and can co-mingle data col-
lected by other users throughout an enterprise.
New Possibilities by Combining Affordances
If we combine two or more of these affordances, new possibili-
ties will emerge. As instructional designers, it is important that we 
understand these various possibilities, and all their combinations, 
before embarking on the design and development of mobile learn-
ing experiences. Learning is complex, and the design of effective 
learning materials requires an understanding of objectives, the 
capabilities of the technologies and environments we are in, and 
the kinds of learning activities that both motivate and teach in a 
way that is engaging and memorable.

Leveraging Geolocation to 
Make Your Content More 
Relevant
Chad Udell
I hope, by now, it’s clear that mlearning is not e-learning on a mobile 
device. Instead of teaching students “just-in-case” they need spe-
cific knowledge at a later date, mobile learning is focused on “just 
enough, just in time, and just for me.” This shift reflects that mobile 
learning is more often about performance support and adaptive 
personalized learning than the study of materials for later use. It is 
also being driven by the move to use some of the unique affordances 
of mobile devices in ways that have never been possible before.
One example of a unique affordance of mobile devices is the 
fact that most of them have built-in GPS, giving them geoloca-
tional capabilities. Almost all mobile devices—phones and tablets 
alike—have some sort of global positioning system (GPS) feature 
available to use in order to help users ascertain where they are and 
what is around them. This feature can be used to tailor a learner’s 
user experience in a very direct and effective manner.
Give Your Learners “Just Enough”
Mobile learning is best suited for smaller bits of information. More 
accurately, good mlearning is more granular than most material 

128    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
used for e-learning. The chunks of information are usually digest-
ible and complete by themselves.
How do you know that small bits of information are accu-
rately chosen and displayed to be useful in a specific geographical 
­context? A couple quick tips on how to use GPS data in mobile 
learning might help.
Keep content short and focused, based on where you are. Different 
use cases can have distinct content needs based on where the 
user is at the time. For this exercise, let’s explore jobsite safety. 
In the jobsite equipment safety training world, a piece of general 
courseware may have to provide an exhaustive list of things that 
the learner needs to know across all conditions and worksites. In 
practice and onsite, only the pieces of equipment available at a 
site really have to have their safety information available as a quick 
reference. Does your jobsite have a concrete saw or a backhoe 
present? No? Then don’t provide safety information to the mobile 
device user about those pieces of equipment.
Combine your location-based curation with the current time to pro-
duce a winning combination. The learner’s intention when accessing 
information at home after work hours is likely different than when 
accessing the same site or app during work hours at the office. 
Think about your habits. When you use the AA.com or Delta.com 
sites for your travel needs from home, you probably are looking for 
different information than when you are en route to the airport in 
a taxi or when you are strolling through the terminal. Infer intent 
via triangulation of location and the setting or time of the access, 
and you can tailor much of the content to match the user’s needs.
Make Sure Your Information Is “Just in Time”
Only in sci-fi productions like Dr. Who or Looper do time and space 
typically cross over, but there can be direct linkages to geolocation 
and time-of-information access in mobile learning. If this concept 
sounds like it came from the future, just follow me for a moment.
With some planning and design, you can create mobile learn-
ing that not only puts information at the person’s fingertips 
when it’s needed, but also can let the person know when and 
where she might need to know something she hasn’t specifically 
requested. For example, here is a serious and very effective use 
of such a notification: If you have an Android smart phone or  

LEVERAGING GEOLOCATION TO MAKE YOUR CONTENT    129
iPhone with iOS 6 or newer, and your carrier supports it, you may 
have at one time received an AMBER Alert for a missing child. 
This is important just-in-time information, and it is targeted to 
specific geographical regions.
Weather alerts can be delivered like this, as well, turning your 
phone into a weather radio of sorts. This is highly effective for sit-
uational awareness enhancement, since the mobile device rarely 
leaves your side.
You could take a similar approach with work-related 
­information—letting your employees know about emergency situ-
ations in an office or even giving your outdoor employees updated 
weather information so they come to the job ready to work with 
the adequate clothing or protective gear.
Just-in-time reaches new heights when you explore the world 
of geofences (a virtual perimeter for a real-world geographic 
area) for your mobile learning. For example, Apple’s Reminders 
app on iOS is capable of telling you to water the garden when 
you return home or to reboot the servers when you get to work, 
because it knows where you live and where you work (provided 
you’ve told it that information ahead of time). Entering and exit-
ing geofenced areas could trigger a nearly infinite number of 
workflows, announcements, and information delivery.
The required APIs for creating geofences are available to be 
used in most major platforms, with Android’s LocationManager 
and iOS’s CoreLocation fitting the bill nicely. Mobile web brows-
ers are also capable of discerning the user’s location, so it is not 
confined to just apps. With the advent of Siri and the coming rise 
of intelligent personal digital assistants, this type of just-in-time 
information is only going to increase.
Take Advantage of “Just for Me”
Mobile, in essence, is always a personal thing. These devices are 
always with us, within reach, and often owned by us. Because of 
this, we’ve made them ours by customizing the devices and setting 
up accounts and preferences. The device can store this informa-
tion and compare it with GPS data to create a customized mix of 
learning content never before possible.
Searches for information can be confined to a specific radius 
around the user, sort the results found by proximity, and even hide 

130    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
or omit irrelevant distant information, which could be construed 
as noise. You have the power as the designer to tailor information 
presented to the users based on where they are and provide per-
sonalized content that is pertinent and timely.
Taking Geolocation Further
When you get the basics, doors open to you that you likely over-
looked in your earlier mobile learning designs. Consider these 
possibilities:
•• Files tied to GPS coordinates
•• Location tied to actions, such as sending messages and emails
•• Geofenced reminders to check things or perform specific tasks
•• Integrating calendars with locations and vice versa
Once you’ve tapped into device capabilities like GPS in your 
mobile learning, you are well on your way to maximizing your work-
ers’ performance by making their information just in time, just 
enough, and just for them.

Incorporating Multi-Touch and 
Gestures into Mobile Learning
Chad Udell
We live in a touchy-feely, device-driven world. Your phone, tab-
lets, and likely your laptop have some ability to interpret and use 
multi-touch input to assist with using your devices in a wide vari-
ety of ways. These types of inputs help us interact with on-screen 
elements, mimic real-world gestures, and lower the wall between 
the metaphor of icon-driven graphics and physical objects. You’ve 
likely seen videos of new computer users, children, and even ani-
mals interacting with smart phones and tablets naturally, easily, 
and with few troubles at all. These devices are intuitive and natu-
ral to use for people (and creatures!) of all ages and skill levels. 
In fact, toddlers who have experiences on a multi-touch tablet will 
often see a magazine as a mobile device that doesn’t work, or a 
television as broken, as they push on objects on a page to see what 
they will do. Reflect on this for a moment in the scope of your 
experience as a designer for other screen-based experiences.
When the original e-learning experiences, such as CD-ROMs 
and web applications, were created, these courses often would 
be accompanied by an introduction that was more like “Using a 
Computer 101” than it was related to the core learning objectives 
for the course. Tutorials like “here is how you use a mouse” (and 
more) all permeated these interactive pieces. This was largely 

132    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
needed, because many users had either little computer experience 
or they had moved from an experience based on monochrome 
“green screens” or terminals to a GUI-driven personal computer.
These tutorials were also needed because using pointer devices 
like a mouse and a cursor is nothing like anything in the real world. 
There is no physical parallel, and the metaphor of files, folders, 
and clicking and dragging is an artificial contrivance at its root.
Why tap “Next” when you can swipe right to left? Why click or 
tap a magnifying glass icon when you can pinch and zoom? The 
rotate or flip buttons are pointless when you can grab an object 
and spin it with two fingers. With touch-based interfaces, the pos-
sibilities are incredible.
So, with the new vocabulary of input and control at our finger-
tips, why are so few of us taking advantage of these new features 
in designing our mlearning experiences? In my view, I think there 
are three primary drivers holding the industry back from adopt-
ing true multi-touch and gestural inputs in our mlearning work:
	 1.	 Lack of design thinking and commitment to creating a 
mobile-first experience,
	 2.	 Lack of experience and vision creating or designing for a 
multi-touch and gestural metaphor, and
	 3.	 Lack of support for these input methods in common author-
ing tools we use to produce typical learning products.
Let’s explore these issues and suggest some ways to overcome 
them.
Creating a Mobile-First Experience
In my book Learning Everywhere (2012), one of the four main con-
tent types I explore is “Content Converted from Other Sources.”
This approach, while valid and appropriate for many pieces of 
content in your library, is by its nature not a mobile-first experi-
ence. This is evident when interactions and elements are brought 
over from a mouse-and-keyboard-driven environment.
Artifacts like mouse hovers, prompts to “click here,” “Next” 
buttons, and many other elements that are needed or helpful on 
a computer have no place or are completely inappropriate and 
unusable on a tablet or smart phone.

INCORPORATING MULTI-TOUCH AND GESTURES INTO MOBILE    133
Consider the cliché of an exploratory or metaphorical inter-
face that requires you to hover over items to gather more informa-
tion on them. This simply will not work on a mobile device.
How to get away from these conventions? The answer is stop 
“converting” and start redesigning. Take into account the target 
device’s capabilities and re-examine all and any user interface or 
user experience factors that could or should change. On-screen 
prompts, user interface controls, and deeper interactions in your 
applications and websites need to be used instead.
Designing for Multi-Touch and Gestural Metaphors
Design disciplines all have their own sets of patterns and conven-
tions, visual languages, and approaches to standardization for 
how the design should be conveyed to engineers, developers, or 
manufacturers who need to interpret the plans to create the final 
product.
Software designers use Garrett IA and UML diagrams. 
Architects use a standard set of views, elevations, or projections, 
and specific types or elements for plumbing, doors, and the 
like. Electrical engineers all use the same sets of figures to relay 
items like transistors, resistors, and other items needed for the 
schematics.
A similar sort of vocabulary for gestural and multi-touch, and 
a set of conventions on when, where, and why the various types of 
gestures should be used, has emerged. Covered in great length 
and amazing detail in Designing Gestural Interfaces (2008), by Dan 
Saffer, this set of rules, and the accompanying visual vocabulary 
that informs developers how to employ them, is something new to 
most of the training community.
A quick Google image search for “multi-touch gestures” results 
in a wide array of visual depictions of these gestures.
Sample Gestures
To begin incorporating these gestures intelligently into your 
work, it would be wise to read up on this topic, but you can also 
find libraries of ready-made graphics to incorporate into your 
sketches and wireframes. Stencils for common diagramming soft-
ware programs like Visio, PowerPoint, Keynote, or OmniGraffle 

134    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
are readily available, so you can start designing with a gestural lan-
guage immediately. Just having access to the templates certainly 
doesn’t make you an expert, but it does give you a framework you 
can start to explore and an expanded toolkit to enable you to 
design mobile-first interfaces.
Supporting Gestural Input in Your Development 
Workflow
If you have started creating mobile-first experiences and docu-
menting your design process with properly annotated gestural 
inputs, you may be wondering where to take things next. If you 
are primarily a rapid e-learning tool user, you have no real options 
available to you at this time. At the time of this writing, no major 
software packages out there—regardless of whether they state they 
support mobile or not—can directly address gestural or multi-
touch input out of the box.
This certainly throws a wrench into the works, but it doesn’t 
need to completely stop you from trying out long presses, swipes, 
and more in your next mobile learning project. For the most part, 
HTML authoring tools don’t support this sort of input directly 
either. There might be documentation for a specific device, and 
operating system developer areas on the web to show you how to 
support these gestures, but you are going to be mostly on your 
own when it comes time to write the code.
Some tutorials can help you get started with multi-touch and 
HTML5, and some mobile-friendly JavaScript libraries already 
have support for these gestures. Recently, some enterprising and 
bright developers have risen to the challenge to make this easier 
and have created some third-party libraries that make developing 
web experiences with multi-touch and gestural input capabilities 
much easier. For example, the library Hammer.js adds robust sup-
port for the most common gestures and touch events. On top of 
that, it has the rather puny tagline, “You can touch this!” to boot, 
if you like that sort of thing.
Summary
The world of multi-touch is an expanding and interesting place 
to explore. The intuitiveness of the use of gestures for interacting 

INCORPORATING MULTI-TOUCH AND GESTURES INTO MOBILE    135
with content is real and demonstrable. Your users will value the 
time you take to craft mobile-first interfaces. With some minor 
adjustments to your design workflow and attention to the changes 
needed in your development toolset, you can accommodate and 
embrace these new ways to empower your users.

Storing Preferences and 
Inferring Intent in Mobile 
Learning Experiences
Chad Udell
Mobile devices are personal. We bring them to work with us, but 
in most cases, still own them, unlike laptop computers provided 
by our companies. We personalize the home screens and wallpa-
pers. We install apps and widgets. We add our own contacts and 
take photos of people we know and places we visit.
These devices know our most intimate details. You bank with 
them. You check on your medical data. You text family members 
updates on your latest news and whereabouts daily without a 
second thought. You perform video calls and maybe even send 
Snapchats for someone’s private consumption.
Our learning on these devices has mostly been devoid of this 
level of personalization. In the pursuit of just in time, we have 
mostly been neglecting the just for me aspects of mobile learning. 
Learning on these highly personal devices should be individual-
ized, as well. A number of sites and apps understand this.
With Yelp, you log in and receive a list of restaurants around you 
and have easy access to comments and reviews. The Weather Channel 
app knows your favorite locations for instant retrieval of weather con-
ditions at your parents’ home or your upcoming vacation destination.
Apple’s Passbook app is indispensible to me, and it may be 
the current ultimate example of inferring intent. It knows where 

138    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
I am going next, what coffee shop I frequent, and when my credit 
card bill is due. It knows what I want to do on the day I do it, and 
whether my flight is delayed.
This schism between our real-world activity and learning isn’t 
that surprising. Our previously created learning content rarely 
took any aspects of personalization into account either. One size 
fits all was the de rigueur standard.
e-Learning has had some success at personalization, modest 
as it might be. Most courses can restart where we left off, know 
when we completed them, and probably even remember what we 
answered on practice exercises or the final assessments. But does 
the course really know about us? What we need? What we are try-
ing to accomplish today?
Properly programmed, our mobile devices can know this. 
From providing us email, tracking calendar events, listing con-
tacts, knowing our location and syncing with our time zone, the 
mobile device you have with you already knows more about you 
than your grade school friends ever did.
Mobile learning can leverage this deep knowledge of us for 
our benefit. Even the simplest HTML5 mobile web experiences 
have rich, powerful databases available to them to store data, pref-
erences, and history. WebSQL (now deprecated), Indexed DB, 
and various tutorials for offline programming and databases for 
iOS and Android are out there offering examples and tips on how 
to tailor a web experience for the user to help personalize and 
store information about the user’s needs.
Just as many web content management systems and social sites 
capture our history and reflect it back to us, we need to start tai-
loring our mobile learning, performance support, and job aid 
experiences to take into account the users’ true needs and prefer-
ences. On a large scale, this requires data storage and bandwidth. 
These are two things we currently have in abundance.
Data storage aside, there is need to use some powerful algo-
rithms if we are truly going to provide information that is “just for 
me.” A growing list of articles, SDKs, engines, and APIs is emerg-
ing to help you do just this.
In 2010, Eric Schmidt took the stage and talked about the next 
logical step for search. “Think of it as a serendipity engine,” Schmidt 
said. “Think of it as a new way of thinking about traditional text search 
where you don’t even have to type” (quoted in Boulton, 2010).

STORING PREFERENCES AND INFERRING INTENT IN MOBILE    139
What we are really talking about is inferring intent via context, 
past expressed intent, our tastes, and our social network behavior. 
This is a powerful recipe to create a perfect learning experience 
for anyone, no matter where he or she is located.
It doesn’t stop there. Natural language processing and digital 
agents will definitely revolutionize the way we receive information 
that is important to us. Why do I need a copy of USA Today outside 
my hotel room door when I have Flipboard and Siri? Almost all of 
the information in an average newspaper is not relevant to me, but 
with a user-agent-assisted or personalized account that knows my 
interests and history, nearly everything is something I want to read, 
share, or even comment on. Certainly, there is a danger that looking 
at the world only through a lens created by you could induce a sort 
of tunnel vision, but with some filters and additions, you can obtain 
a blend of items that remains relevant with little extra filler. Tell Siri 
to find articles you might want to read? Maybe not yet, but soon.
A lot of research is going on in this area, of course. Public 
relations firm Ruder Finn published an exhaustive survey in 2009 
that outlines a wide array of use cases segmented by demograph-
ics. Their Mobile Intent Index asked respondents how frequently 
they use their mobile phones to go online, based on 295 possible 
reasons. The primary reason to go online was “instant gratifica-
tion.” While the study’s excerpt states that “mobile phones are 
not a learning tool,” 64 percent of all users say they go online with 
their mobile device for education or research.
Intent has been an area of research for human-computer 
interaction (HCI) for some time, starting with a 2004 doctoral 
dissertation that covered a “method of programming robots to 
automate motor tasks by inferring the intent of users based on 
demonstrations of a task” (Dixon, 2004), and a very interest-
ing piece from 2012 on “Language intent models for inferring 
user browsing behavior” (Tsagkias & Blanco, 2012). New books  
by Bin Aftab and Karim (2014) and Sukthankar, Goldman, Geib, 
Pynadath, and Bui (2014) are adding to the growing research in this  
area. Recall Schmidt’s quote on searching without having to type? 
Google I/O 2013 unveiled just that.
Not to be outdone (at least not too much), Yahoo! Labs also 
has a great research area on this topic. Tracking trends, providing 
context for search, and much more are just around the corner, if 
not already here in one shape or form already.

140    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
It’s clear there are fantastic developments in this area coming 
shortly, as well as a number of ways to try out things already, avail-
able for you to start on inferring your learners’ intent in order to 
improve mobile interface design. Just don’t forget it.

Using a Mobile Camera as a 
Powerful Learning Tool
Chad Udell
The old cliché goes something like this: “the best camera is the 
one you have on you.” As trite as this sounds, I do think this is true.
I’ve gone from camera to camera, each getting smaller and 
smaller. Of course, this increases the convenience of carrying 
them around. It’s just easier to bring them with me when they fit 
into a pocket. Until recently, I carried a stand-alone camera with 
me almost all of the time.
However, the latest generations of smart phones have dramat-
ically improved their imaging capabilities. Capturing images with 
5 to 8 megapixels is considered baseline functionality in 2014. 
Phones are often better cameras than the point-and-shoots we own 
because they offer HD video recording, flash, high dynamic range 
imaging (HDRI), and sometimes even 3D or slow motion video.
Because of these new capabilities, and the fact that I always 
have my phone with me, I rarely take my point-and-shoot with me, 
never mind my larger SLR camera. The key for me is that I have 
my phone with me and don’t need to think about bringing the 
camera. The SLR still is used because it has capabilities beyond 
my phone camera, but taking it along with me is a very deliberate 
planned activity. The point-and-shoot collects dust.
Images and video are powerful learning tools—viewing and 
creating them can be a great way to learn. When you couple the 
image-gathering capabilities of an up-to-date smart phone with 

142    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
the network connectivity and other features on board, you have a 
very capable platform for creating and consuming visual content.
New affordances like heads-up display (HUD) and augmented 
reality (AR) are additional dimensions to your image-based learn-
ing content that only mobile devices can provide. This is a brand-
new world of performance support and just-in-time information, 
as well as social and informal learning. Visual assessment via com-
puter vision and object detection are also new avenues we have 
open to us in the learning world.
Exploring in More Detail
The device’s camera is only a camera in the loosest of terms. Sure, 
it can capture images as both stills and video, but really, it’s also a 
digital visual input device that allows the output to be processed 
and presented in a multitude of ways.
We see this already in everyday uses like scanning QR codes, 
cameras autofocusing on faces in frame to enhance your photos, 
adding filters to Instagram images, and on and on. Some other 
examples that are out there that are exciting from a learning 
point of view are apps like Leafsnap and Word Lens.
Leafsnap, a project from Columbia University, the University of 
Maryland, and the Smithsonian Institution, is a mobile field guide 
that helps you identify trees of the northeastern United States based 
on the shape of their leaves. This is accomplished via a technique 
known as computer vision and, even more specifically, a trained 
object-recognition process. In another example, Word Lens, 
launched in 2010, allows you to point your camera at signage and 
have the message on the sign translated into your desired language.
Now the wheels are spinning, I hope. So much more than 
a simple camera, the visual output from the sensor can also be 
coupled with on-screen elements to show way-finding clues, visual 
overlays for geolocation, temperature, or any number of things 
and can even be processed to alter the image for easier under-
standing of what you may be looking at.
For some examples outside of the mobile device realm, con-
sider some heads-up display and image-processing examples:
•• These types of wearable displays have been augmenting vision 
and providing real-time information to pilots and military 
applications for years.

using a mobile camera as a powerful learning tool    143
•• With a smart phone, you can enhance images and add useful 
overlays to assist your learners in finding where they need to 
go, or even where to grab dessert, by combining the image 
with geolocation data.
•• With Google Glass on the horizon and with other wearable 
technology coming soon, I expect this sort of view to become 
even more common.
•• Augmented displays offer many things that make them a really 
useful performance tool: repair instructions, facial recogni-
tion, real-time video chat, and even visual checklists could all 
become common working and learning tools.
•• Consider the possibilities of applications that both inform you 
how to set up a workstation or retail shelf, and then verify that 
you have set it up correctly through pattern recognition using 
computer vision. I fully expect the use of augmented vision 
and glasses to be a must-have job accessory for technicians and 
people who work with their hands by 2020.
I realize this may all seem like science fiction now. You can 
begin today, though. Think about creating an internal image data-
base where co-workers share best practices. Or maybe you could 
create a video-sharing portal where people narrate their work and 
share how they do things. These ideas, and much more, are all rel-
atively easy to set up with common content management systems 
and some modest application development effort.
Some of these use cases may require building an app, because 
they will not work as mobile web experiences due to browser 
­security issues or capabilities. As always, determine whether your 
technology strategy and your audience goals align.
The really cool thing about all of this is that it clearly shows that 
mobile learning is a two-way street. Both consuming and ­creating 
images can be enlightening and add to performance ­outcomes 
for your organization.

Employing Mobile Device 
Sensors for Enhanced Learning 
Experiences
Chad Udell
Many new features make mobile devices unique and particularly 
well-suited to provide just-in-time information to a mobile learner. 
For example, the sensors you carry around with you on a daily basis 
in your smart phone and tablet are collecting data. This data can 
be used to learn an awful lot about your immediate surroundings 
and enhance your awareness, to help you make better-informed 
decisions.
This should come as no surprise to anyone with the ability to 
access lots of data, but, of course, data by itself is not the important 
thing. Data, when interpreted as information, can provide insight. 
Insight, when applied, can create impetus for action.
So, in essence, by creating a conduit to our surroundings via 
a device that can provide the data, the use of applications or ser-
vices that interpret this data to give the user insight can lead to 
better and more successful actions. Fewer mistakes, better out-
comes, more productivity, and more safety can be provided by vir-
tue of successful use of the data gathered by the devices we carry 
with us everywhere.

146    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
I Sense Something, a Presence  
I’ve Not Felt Since. . . .
It could seem like we’ve gone a bit off the ranch here, but smart 
mobile devices are essentially the current-day equivalent of what 
has been represented in the Star Trek universe as the Tricorder 
(per Wikipedia: “a multifunction hand-held device used for sen-
sor scanning, data analysis, and recording data”).
The sensors I’ve discussed in other chapters—cameras and 
GPS, and others—are now pretty much universal. That is, all the 
devices we would consider smart phones or tablets have them on 
board, although many other sensors out there might be a little 
more on the fringe of most people’s experience. It’s clear we are 
just at the beginning of the sensor age on these ubiquitous devices. 
A few non-typical sensors that we’ve spotted in the wild include:
•• Light sensors
•• Barometers
•• Pressure sensors
•• Thermometers
•• Altimeters
•• Humidity sensors
•• Magnetometers
•• Breathalyzers
The Android world seems to be leading the way in this era of 
adding “extra” sensors to your devices. For example, if you want 
a thermometer-enabled device in the Android world, simply pick 
up a Samsung Galaxy S4, but if you want the same feature on 
your iPhone, you’re going to need to buy a Thermodo. Certainly 
doable, but considering the built-in sensors in the Android devices 
likely only cost a few dollars, you can see why adding sensors to 
your non-enabled devices can become unnecessarily costly.
We’re Just Warming Up
This is really just the tip of the iceberg. Where these sensors are 
now a luxury item or a hit-and-miss proposition, we’re going to see  

EMPLOYING MOBILE DEVICE SENSORS FOR ENHANCED LEARNING    147
an influx of them across the buying spectrum as this technology 
becomes cheaper and smaller. With these additional sensors, 
we’ll see the growth of a software segment call “appcessories.”  
Of course, if you have sensors, you need the apps to provide infor-
mation and insight to the new data you’re gathering, right?
With the next-next generation of devices, the third-party 
adapters and add-ons for them, we could see things like air qual-
ity sensors, motion detection, EKG/pulse and blood pressure 
monitors, and PH/alkalinity sensors in the not too distant future. 
Touch-free gestural inputs and the connected nature of wearable 
computing all fit right in here. Your entire body and the environ-
ment around you become the just-in-time information gatherer 
and delivery mechanism.
Although it may be a little frivolous, want to see something 
available today that is certainly a sign of things to come? Check 
out the brainwave sensing cat ears from Necomimi.com that you 
can buy right now to let everyone know just what you are feeling. 
Goofy? Definitely! When similar technology can be used to pro-
vide brain scans or MRI data in real time as a consumer technol-
ogy, we will have reached a breakthrough in health, science, and 
human augmentation.
What sorts of things can you do with these sensors? Of course, 
there are the immediate applications where sensors directly add to 
your user experience, such as being able to measure light level, tem-
perature, and more. The immediate uses obviously give your audi-
ence more inputs about the world around them and can allow them 
to make more accurate decisions on a one-on-one basis.
But what if your “appcessories” that use these apps are gath-
ering the data in an aggregate form? The creation of big data on 
your workers’ surroundings could change a lot about how we do 
business today.
Are your workers always in high-humidity situations? What are 
the temperature readings like for your workers at a jobsite? Are your 
corridors adequately lit to perform the maintenance you want? Are 
your workers using the devices when they are driving, even though 
they shouldn’t be?
You can see where this quickly moves beyond the typical view 
of what learning is. Maybe the role of the learner is flipped here. 
The users are the creators of content, and their managers are the 
learners.

148    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
What’s Next, and How Do I Start?
What is going to drive the addition of sensors to mobile devices? 
As an answer, I recommend reading up on how a thermometer 
made it into the Samsung Galaxy S4 (OpenSignal, 2013). It’s 
going to require openness by the platform providers to include 
some of the required hooks in their operating systems, and sensor 
manufacturers may also want to write their own driver code to get 
the hardware manufacturers to put the sensors in their phones. 
It’s going to start slowly at first, but competition will heat up (pun 
intended).
Another interesting way to approach this topic is by creating 
the sensor device you need and then applying for acceptance 
from initiatives like Apple’s MFi program, in which you can create 
AirPlay or Lightning connector-enabled add-on devices for iOS. 
There are lots of requirements for such a program, so be sure to 
check whether you qualify first.
It’s clear there are many areas of potential growth for mobile 
sensors. The best thing you can do is to keep your ears and eyes 
open right now. Take a look at your target platforms and devices if 
there is a chance you want to access something in the users’ imme-
diate surrounding and help them do their jobs better.
You may be pleasantly surprised to find out that you can assist 
them in ways that seemed like science fiction only a few months ago.

Alternative Reality Games as 
Mobile Learning
John Feser
Sometimes, learning can take place by participating in activities in the 
real world, where mobile devices are used to supplement informa-
tion or give direction to learners who only occasionally look at their 
screens. This is the case for many alternate reality games or ARGs for 
short (pronounced by saying the letters A-R-G, not by sounding like 
a pirate), interactive narratives that use the real world as a stage for 
telling a story, acting out a scenario, playing a live game, or creating a 
learning experience. ARGs make use of diverse media and game ele-
ments to help tell and impact the outcome of the story. In an ARG, 
participants are presented with clues in an effort to solve puzzles and 
make informed decisions in the game’s unfolding narrative. These 
clues can be located in different places from physical locations (such 
as a library, school, office building, or grocery store) to media (such 
as websites, recorded telephone messages, videos, or images).
In many ARGs. the story evolves as the organizers stay one step 
ahead of the participants, changing the direction of the game 
based on the responses and reactions of those playing. Because 
ARGs link a fictional story to real-world objects and places, mobile 
devices are a natural medium to involve in the gameplay. Often, 
mobile-specific technologies are employed to enrich the experi-
ence and further blur the lines between the game environment 
and the real world, such as QR codes, geolocation data, and using 

150    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
the device’s camera to acquire evidence. The emergent technol-
ogy of near field communications (NFC) will likely also have great 
potential for ARGs in the future.
Examples
ARGs have been used in many areas for a number of different 
purposes. From a marketing perspective, a number of very suc-
cessful ARGs have been written as a way to build product aware-
ness. A very popular ARG called I Love Bees was produced to 
market the 2004 video game Halo 2. In 2007, Nine Inch Nails 
released an ARG called Year Zero as a way to market their upcom-
ing album by the same name. The game was well received and 
won a couple of Webby awards as evidence of its overall success 
and well-constructed world, depicting a crumbling society that 
echoed the state of the music industry. In perhaps one of the best 
known ARGs to date, fans of the TV show LOST could participate 
in an ARG called The LOST Experience. The following descrip-
tion comes from The LOST Experience website:
The LOST Experience takes LOST fans on an expansive, inter-
national Easter egg hunt through websites, commercials, emails, 
phone numbers, and more, in search of pieces to a larger puzzle,  
a puzzle which, when solved, will enlighten LOST fans to some of 
the show’s deepest mysteries!
ARGs have also been used to solve real-world problems.  
An ARG called World Without Oil was created to obtain collec-
tive input from players about dealing with the world’s dependency 
on oil. World Without Oil simulates the first thirty-two days of a 
global oil crisis and establishes a “citizen nerve center” to track 
events and share ideas. In October 2008 the British Red Cross 
created a serious ARG called Traces of Hope to promote their 
campaign about civilians caught up in conflict.
The more serious ARGs, such as World Without Oil and Traces 
of Hope, are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to using 
“serious games” to enforce learning objectives and help drive key 
takeaways home for the learners/gamers participating in them. 
These collective problem-solving efforts promote teamwork, 
creative problem solving, and responding and communicating 

alternative reality games as mobile learning    151
effectively in a fluid and continuously evolving situation. Strong 
stuff, indeed!
The Applicability of ARGs in Organizational 
Learning
ARGs are an excellent way to enhance or supplement an organi-
zation’s learning program for many reasons. Let’s examine a few 
of them here.
ARGs Are Immersive: The gaming nature of ARGs naturally has 
the ability to involve people, require them to collaborate and solve 
problems, and can be written to tap into people’s competitive 
spirit. If a game is written properly, all of this can be done in a way 
that ensures learning is occurring and incented.
ARGs Can Ensure Baseline Knowledge: Often, organizations 
struggle with developing training that meets the needs of people 
with different levels of expertise and experience with a particular 
topic. ARGs can be used to help people build prerequisite knowl-
edge necessary for the next level of learning. Those who have the 
background and experience can quickly solve the puzzles and 
challenges presented, and be rewarded accordingly, while those 
who need more background can spend the time and use available 
resources to build their knowledge base. This helps level the play-
ing field going forward and reduces remediation.
ARGs Help Spice Up Dry Content: ARGs can be used as a part of 
employee on-boarding programs, where much of the information 
presented is less than exciting, but nonetheless important, and in 
some cases required by law. By sharing this information through 
a story and in a game format, the elements of a game, keeping 
score, competition, problem solving, and so forth, can be used to 
enhance content that otherwise may be presented in a presenta-
tion or written format. Envision an office park scavenger hunt and 
you may be onto something here.
ARGs Are Helpful in Assessing Knowledge: Well-designed and 
scripted ARGs can be a powerful way to assess learner knowledge 
and retention. Because of the problem-solving nature of ARGs, 
observing how players react to various situations provides great 
insight to what they really know. In addition, those running the 
ARG can control events as gameplay occurs, allowing them to 
adjust the difficulty level in real time. Countless metrics could be 

152    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
occurring behind the scenes, from execution time to accuracy 
and much, much more.
ARGs Are Cost-Effective: ARGs offer a significant amount of flex-
ibility when it comes to their design and complexity. The writing 
and story are the basis for a good ARG, not the specific technol-
ogy. Very elaborate ARGs can be written with the only tool needed 
to play a mobile phone with text messaging. A simple bridge 
between an SMS gateway and an LMS or CMS is all you would 
need for tallying and record-keeping.
Getting Started
ARGs may seem daunting from a design perspective. As with any 
form of learning development, success comes from first creating 
a good plan. First consider the audience, the message to be con-
veyed, and the resulting behavior. Use these discoveries to inform 
your game framework, the writing, the media asset creation, and 
the ongoing gameplay and measurement.
Audience: The audience will have a big impact on the design 
of an ARG. Is the audience tech-savvy? Do they know each other 
well? Are they located where they can physically work together 
or will collaboration mean working remotely? Understanding the 
users’ personas will go a long way toward ensuring a solid design 
that works well for the players.
Messages: Determine the key messages to be communicated as 
a result of the game. Is the information to be presented high-level 
or subtle details of a situation? Is the subject matter easy to under-
stand or complex? Approach these messages much like you would 
in creating the learning objectives for your courseware or crafting 
the use cases for your mobile applications.
Behaviors: What behavioral outcomes should result from this 
experience? Maybe the purpose is motivational or team building, or 
maybe it is to emphasize a point or raise awareness. Whatever your 
desired conversion point, ensure you have created the interaction 
points to drive these concepts home and you have placed measure-
ment tools at these critical junctures in order to measure effec-
tiveness. Considering these elements up front is critical to making  
sure the storyline and the gameplay achieve the desired results.
Environmental Considerations: The next step in developing an 
ARG design doc is to plan for the setting and timeframe. Will the 

alternative reality games as mobile learning    153
game space be limited to a specific venue, or will it encompass 
a wider area? The answer to this question can impact the tech-
nology that can and should be used. Will the game occur over a 
couple of hours or days, or will it happen over a period of months? 
Finally, how will the ARG integrate with other aspects of the train-
ing or learning environment? ARGs are most effective when they 
are integrated with a larger plan and not just something that is 
“piled on” as an extra. For example, if an ARG is being used to 
introduce and excite people about an upcoming conference, 
then the ARG should have a direct tie-in to the themes and events 
of the conference. An ARG used at the corporate headquarters as 
part of the on-boarding process is going to be doomed to failure 
unless it is given consideration in the new employees’ schedules. 
Plan accordingly.
Writing the Story: The story surrounding the ARG should be 
written to match the audience and environment, as well as meet 
the goals and objectives that have been established. However, there  
are a couple of other considerations to take into account.  
The first is the game lifespan and refresh cycle. Will the ARG 
be played once by a group of people with a specific end date, or  
is the game intended to be ongoing with people starting at differ-
ent times over a longer period? Will there be a reset at intermittent 
times in order to start again? Another important consideration is 
monitoring and controlling of the gameplay. Is the outcome fixed 
and the same for each participant, or will the game be allowed to 
evolve with no specific outcome identified ahead of time? These 
decisions will greatly influence how the story is written and how 
the clues are developed.
Developing Your ARG: Obviously, playing a few ARGs is an 
important first step to being able to develop a successful game. A 
number of online resources are available to help you start. Giant 
Mice has a nice resource page with many links on various ARG 
development topics. There are also resources on how to design 
and organize your ARG. There are so many ways to design and 
develop your ARG that explaining them all in this chapter would 
easily double or triple its size. But many resources on the web pro-
vide excellent information and numerous ideas. Tandem Learning 
has a number of great resources at their website, as well. From a 
mobile development perspective, there are many easily available 
tools and services, such as SMS (text messaging) and open source, 

154    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
and other free tools that can be adapted to serve as a framework 
for building your game.
Key Components of  
a Successful Learning ARG
Some other qualities you should keep in mind as you craft your 
masterpiece include:
Verisimilitude: The story supporting the ARG, while often fic-
tional in nature, still should have an element of reality and truth-
fulness. Because gameplay takes place in the real world in physical 
locations, the storyline should be informative, engaging, and 
believable.
Easy to Use: In many cases, the players will not be deeply famil-
iar with ARGs and, in some cases, will not even know what an 
ARG is. The technology used to play the ARG should not be the 
focus; the story should be the focus. Therefore, successful ARGs 
use technology to enhance the experience by being easy to use. If 
players have to spend all their time trying to figure out the tech-
nology, they will be distracted from the real intent of the game. In 
other words, Know Thy Audience.
Importance: Consider the importance of the ARG to the over-
all learning experience. Again, thinking about the audience and 
their receptiveness to this type of experience, many ARGs are 
designed to be an optional supplement to the real training. In 
these cases, people should be able to enter and leave the game 
at any time without real-life consequences. As an example, The 
LOST Experience, written for the TV series LOST, was not 
required in order to understand the TV show or to follow the plot. 
But for those who were interested in increasing their engagement 
with the show, the ARG served to provide additional insights to 
the overall story and enhance the viewing experience. Likewise, 
other ARGs we have played at conferences and events add to the 
experience of the event, but were not required in order to have a 
baseline experience at the event.
Conclusion
Mobile devices, combined with a good story and an educational 
game, can be a powerful way to increase engagement and the 

alternative reality games as mobile learning    155
activity level of your learners. ARGs offer an interesting way to 
bring your mobile technology along for the ride. ARGs are being 
successfully used in marketing and entertainment, as well as to 
train and solve real-world problems. Organizations that are look-
ing for creative ways to engage in mobile learning should consider 
the benefits ARGs have to offer. By crafting a realistic, enjoyable 
experience, you’ll be reinforcing behaviors that most companies 
are actively seeking in their employees: critical problem solving, 
inquisitiveness, and creativity.

Using Mobile Games for Sales 
Training and Assessment
Chad Udell
Most of us would agree that salespeople are competitive by 
nature. This is obvious and necessary for performing well in the 
job. After all, these are the people we put on the front lines to 
win the day and bring back revenue-producing opportunities for 
the company. They are assessed on their sales performance via 
metrics and measurements, and they’re incentivized with com-
pensation and perks. Many organizations even have annual sales 
drives or competitions to quantify the level of performance and 
measure who is the best.
This driving force is often left out of the learning and devel-
opment world, and we see the effects of this all the time. In my 
experience, salespeople have often been some of the most disin-
terested in training in the entire organization. They want to be 
out there on the road performing, not in a classroom or behind a 
desk taking some coursework.
Some of the most effective sales training materials I have 
helped create have included gaming experiences. A competitive 
approach to testing product knowledge or soft skills can liven 
up interest among your sales audience and bring them back to 
the fold in order to make sure they are equipped with the most 
up-to-date information on company products, policies, and best 
practices.

158    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Surveying conferences and the bookshelves, it’s clear that 
gaming and gamification are emerging as powerful learning tools. 
Gaming may be a bit over-hyped in some circles, but you can tell 
just by how successful public sites, products, and services, such as 
Fitocracy, Foursquare, Nike FuelBand, and others, are in appeal-
ing to people’s competitive nature, that there is something worth 
looking into in your learning practice areas.
We live in a world of badges, mayorships, awards, and mobile 
social networks that reward contributors for doing everything 
from checking into a coffee shop to trying a new beer at Untappd.
com. When applying gaming and gamification to your learning, 
it is important to know that simply adding badges to course com-
pletions and high assessment scores is not enough and is really 
counterproductive, in many cases.
Well-designed game experiences are a careful blend of dynamics 
(featuring emergent gameplay styles and progression) and mechan-
ics (the construct for the game and reward/penalty cycle). The suc-
cessful game is bounded by rules and constraints whereby a player 
achieves some amount of progression or success by leveraging these 
to his benefit. Adding badges to a training curriculum does nothing 
of this sort and will not be noticed by the competitive sales team.
A balanced approach is needed, and balance is achieved 
through a careful design process. For a great overview on the game 
design process and how to apply it to your learning experiences, 
I recommend you read A Theory of Fun for Game Design by Raph 
Koster (2004) and The Gamification of Learning and Instruction by 
Karl Kapp (2012). After delving into these titles, you’ll have a solid 
grounding in game design principles and, if you so choose, a base 
to start designing your own experiences. Raph’s book is a great 
survey of what makes games good, and Karl’s book is a study of the 
elements of games that can be applied to instruction.
After you have the principles in your quiver, it may be time 
to look around to see what tools you have available to help you. 
If your sales team uses Salesforce as their customer relationship 
management (CRM) program, you may be able to turn it into a 
game itself. A few companies have created gamification layers to 
add to Salesforce: Compete, Bunchball, and a few other bigger 
players. Keep in mind that the technology is only a part of the 
equation. It’s up to you to craft the experience that works for your 
team and the content you are delivering.

using mobile games for sales training and assessment    159
Prefab frameworks are a good place to start, but I think that 
custom-designed experiences offer the best chance for success—
when implemented correctly. Some key tips to help you in this 
process follow:
•• Keep the desired outcomes in mind throughout the design 
process.
•• Excess ornamentation or needless hoops to jump through 
impede the learning process. Don’t build lengthy tutorials or 
instructions into your experiences; your learners will “get it.”
•• Make the game easy enough to offer some level of success, but 
not so easy that people lose interest. You want them to keep 
plunking their quarters in!
•• Use the gaming mechanics and dynamics to reinforce the 
behavior you want to shape and enhance the knowledge trans-
fer. The game isn’t fluff added to the learning; the game is the 
learning.
•• The gamification methods and tools you use must lend 
­themselves to the content you are delivering.
Sticking with these tips is harder than it may sound. The most 
successful projects I have been involved in that used gaming had 
a few things in common:
•• Using a public scoreboard can be an effective motivator.
•• Using true mobile design conventions puts your experience 
on equal footing with other gaming experiences on their 
devices.
•• Don’t neglect proper time for quality control (QC) and 
­testing. Games can be easy to break and have notoriously 
tricky bugs to locate and fix.
•• Hire a proper game designer if you are not confident you 
can deliver. Designing a proper game for learning is not like 
designing straightforward learning content based on your 
­previous experience. It’s okay to ask for help.

take that competitive nature and use it to feed that flywheel.

Voice and Messaging for 
Mobile Learning
Chad Udell
With all the really cool things mobile devices can do, it’s very easy to 
overlook their original function—communication. More specifically, 
mobile devices were originally created primarily for voice communica-
tion. The first cell phones in the early 1970s didn’t have LED screens, 
QWERTY keyboards, or touchscreens. They were created to make 
voice calls. When Martin Cooper unveiled the Motorola cell phone 
in 1973, he made a voice call to rival Joel Engel at Bell Labs (Ziegler, 
2012). No text message, no email. These phones didn’t have cameras 
on them or any sort of extra features we all take for granted now.
After all, in the evolution of long distance communication, 
bidirectional voice would be considered superior to other meth-
ods such as the telegraph or two-way radios, where only one 
person can speak at a time. Voice is synchronous, requires no typ-
ing or transcription, and can take place anywhere. Now, as cell 
phones have progressed and gained Internet connectivity and var-
ious forms of messaging and media capture, there are many other 
channels to communicate with others while on the go.
Voice can still be a very powerful way to learn something. 
No one can forget the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire “Phone a 
Friend” lifeline rule. When you are stuck, why not call someone? 
Of course, that someone could be a co-worker, mentor, or other 
person in your learning network, but with the use of interactive  

162    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
voice response (IVR), it could just as easily be calling a computer-
ized switchboard that can provide you an answer.
My favorite example of IVR might just be Kramer’s Moviefone  
service from Seinfeld (www.youtube.com/watch?v=qM79_itR0Nc),  
but while that was comically bad and confusing for the users of the 
service, many new IVR systems are quite powerful and economi-
cal to set up. If the problem you are trying to solve can be fixed 
via troubleshooting, a defined process, or other sorts of defined 
steps, an IVR system might just be a valuable performance sup-
port tool for your workforce. Via HTML telephone tags and data 
detectors in your web pages and apps, it’s very easy to trigger the 
telephone function on your phone. With VoIP apps and options 
like Google Voice and Skype, you can even make phone calls from 
your tablet devices.
IVR is great for simple applications, but if you want to unlock 
the power of voice, examine the “speech to text” (STT) and “text 
to speech” (TTS) world of software available to you on mobile 
devices. Apple made a splash when it introduced Siri with iOS 6, 
but while it was certainly a big step toward creating a personal dig-
ital assistant, the actual functionality of text to speech and speech 
to text has been available in Apple’s mobile operating system for 
some time.
Dictation had been available for messages and other applica-
tion text fields since iOS 5 via technology from Nuance, the mak-
ers of Dragon Naturally Speaking voice recognition software for 
desktop computers.
Google has since followed suit, adding voice dictation and 
TTS/STT features to its Android platform over time. The Google 
Now feature set and Android Voice Actions allow you to do a lot 
of great things with your device using only your voice. As of early 
2014, here’s a list of things you can do with Android Voice Actions:
	 1.	 Make a phone call
	 2.	 View a map of places around you
	 3.	 Start navigation (voice guided) to a location
	 4.	 Send a text message
	 5.	 Write and send an email
	 6.	 Play some music
	 7.	 Send a written “note to self” message

voice and messaging for mobile learning    163
	 8.	 Find a website online
	 9.	 Look up a definition
Simple, but useful. The functionality in this area is only going 
to expand as the operating system makers add functions that are 
voice controllable. The features will expand more dramatically 
when the application programming interfaces (APIs) for interfac-
ing with voice controls are made more open. Siri on iOS is pretty 
much a black box at this time. Google Now is a bit more open. 
Some things you can query Google Now for using voice and the 
required APIs, according to Programmableweb.com, are
•• Ask how long your commute will take, with an option for 
­alternate routes (Google Directions API)
•• Find next arrivals when commuting by train or bus (Google 
Directions API)
•• When traveling, see nearby places and find local recommenda-
tions (Google Places API, Zagat)
•• See your next appointment and see when to leave (Google 
Calendar API, Google Directions API)
•• For an upcoming flight, see the terminal, gate, and status 
(likely an external source, such as Flight Stats API)
•• Updates on favorite sports teams in real time with the score 
(likely one of the three sports data APIs)
•• While traveling, automatically get a translation, currency 
conversion and the time back home (Google Translate API, 
Unofficial Google Currency Converter)
A number of third-party software development kits (SDKs) are 
emerging to add voice control to your apps as well. For example, 
Nuance now has industry-specific voice libraries available for use 
in your mobile applications, allowing people in engineering or 
medical professions to add field-specific jargon to their apps in 
order to facilitate voice control and increase utility. Their NDEV 
mobile developer program offers application starter kits and more 
to jump-start your mobile development efforts.
The rest of the technology world is quickly ramping up their 
support of speech control in their products. People want easy access 

164    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
to technology, and voice definitely lowers the bar in terms of ease 
of use, when done well. It keeps your hands free and allows you 
to maintain your focus on the task at hand. Vehicle makers are all 
over this, with announcements galore featuring vehicle and voice 
integration, data, search, and much more at the 2014 Consumer 
Electronic Show in Las Vegas.
Google Glass is nearly completely navigable via voice when 
you get the hang of it. The smart watch market is also on board, 
with Samsung’s Gear offering the S Voice feature set, allowing you 
to interface with smart phones and websites seamlessly using sim-
ple voice commands.
I recently picked up an Xbox One game console for my home 
and almost never need to touch it. I can power it on and off, watch 
a movie, start a game or video chat, and much more, with just my 
voice. It has some minor wrinkles and bugs for sure, but overall it 
works pretty well, and I have to say, it all seems very futuristic to me 
when I use it. After all, who didn’t watch Star Trek and have some 
bit of wonder and awe at how they asked their computers to do 
tasks for them—make them Earl Grey tea, and much more, simply 
by talking to them.
So what are you waiting for? There are a lot of options to start 
using voice in your mobile learning projects. Time to talk with 
your team about how you can talk to your learning systems.

Using Mobile Devices as  
Research Tools
Gary Woodill
Because traditional e-learning has mostly been about presenta-
tions and activities designed by expert instructors, distributed 
to learners via desktop and laptop screens, we tend to forget the 
power of the multidirectional capabilities of mobile devices.
Mobile phones are not just for phone calls, and tablets are not 
just for viewing materials; both can also be used to collect data in 
several different formats and send them to a central server or to 
other people. With a server and appropriate software, the data can 
be aggregated and analyzed, with tables and visualizations auto-
matically generated, creating new knowledge that can be distrib-
uted to many others via electronic networks. Gathering research 
using mobile devices is an active and valid learning activity because 
learners must engage in the real world in which they are immersed, 
using their mobile phones or tablets to record and send back inter-
esting information about the context in which they are located.
The use of mobile devices dramatically increases the sheer 
number of observation points that are potentially available to 
researchers, as well as opening up the possibilities of automatic 
data collection through programs that track user location and 
activities. With more than six billion mobile phones in use world-
wide, including one billion smart phones, the mobile phone 
network is emerging as part of a “global brain” with sensors 

166    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
everywhere. Companies such as Fourier Systems provide inexpen-
sive purpose-built mobile devices that are specifically designed 
for data logging for both school science projects and industrial 
settings.
We are only now starting to grasp the immense potential of 
mobile devices for research. Let’s look at some examples of how 
mobile devices are being used as research tools.
Research on Mobile Phone Use
One obvious area of developing research is on the use of mobile 
phones themselves. For example, Nokia hired U.K. company GfK 
to monitor their whole portfolio of digital channels, including 
both standard and mobile websites or online shopping. This posed 
a number of challenges in developing an online survey that would 
work on both a mobile phone as well as a PC, across all possible 
brands and models of mobile phones, on the various different 
mobile operating systems, as well as in all the languages for the 
countries in which Nokia operates. Nevertheless, GfK achieved 
over 100,000 completed interviews in less than a year.
Because they are data collection devices, mobile phones can 
be used to track users’ behaviors while they are using their phones 
to see who, how, and why they use specific apps or websites.
UserZoom has developed a user experience (UX) research tool 
that collects this data for iOS and Android devices. Researchers 
are able to conduct studies on persona definition, satisfaction sur-
veys, usability testing, exit opinions, and more. Actual behavioral 
data is collected, as well as the results of surveys.
Mobile Devices for Market Research
With the proliferation of channels communicating brand mes-
sages to consumers in today’s world, there is a growing need to 
help businesses understand which messages are the most effec-
tive and how they resonate with consumers. “Mobile Moments of 
Truth” is a research tool being developed by GfK that uses the 
mobile phone to capture and collect the full range of brand expe-
riences. Rather than waiting to ask consumers to recall all brand 
exposures during a given time frame, selected consumers are able 
to take an image using their mobile phone every time they see or 

using mobile devices as research tools     167
experience a brand and give a short report on where, why, and 
how they felt. This is all achieved through a simple online sur-
vey tool that not only gives time-sensitive, granular feedback, but 
also consumer-created images that give a real-life context for each 
experience.
In another example, Qustodian, a Spanish start-up, connects 
people with brands they like via their mobile phones. Members 
choose the companies they’d like to hear from, then earn cash 
by downloading apps or checking for the latest news and offers 
from their favorite companies, and answering surveys. Qustodian 
already has more than 50,000 members and has worked with 
brands such as Pepsi, Adidas, and Ford.
Hewlett-Packard conducted a qualitative research project 
that followed the purchasing paths of incoming college students 
by allowing them to use their mobile phones to document their 
behaviors. The methodology included the use of mobile cameras 
and screen tracking to follow the students’ movements and expe-
riences throughout the day. This kind of data is invaluable to mar-
ket researchers.
Mobile Research in the Human Sciences
Because most people carry them around, mobile phones seem 
particularly useful for research in the human sciences. Surveys, 
questionnaires, videos, audio recordings, and polls can be pro-
duced using mobile phones, tablets, and notebook computers.
But what if you want to go beyond surveys and questionnaires 
and obtain more in-depth descriptive information from people 
via their mobile phones? There’s an app for that, as well.
For example, in 2011, Stephane Dufau and his colleagues in 
France collected data in cognitive science experiments from thou-
sands of subjects from all over the world. The team reported that 
“this mass coordinated use of smart phones creates a novel and 
powerful scientific ‘instrument’ that yields the data necessary to 
test universal theories of cognition. This increase in power rep-
resents a potential revolution in cognitive science.”
In a different approach to mobile research, a team at the 
London School of Economics has launched an iPhone app to dis-
cover how people’s feelings are affected by their surroundings. 
The Mappiness app asks people a few times a day to say how they 

168    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
are feeling, what they are doing, and where they are. It can also 
use GPS to pinpoint the user’s location. More than 45,000 partici-
pants have already signed up, generating more than three million 
geolocated responses.
Not just the behavior of individuals is being researched using 
mobile devices. These devices are also being used to make sense 
of social networks and the connections among large groups of 
people. Harris Interactive is using GPS data from mobile phones 
to track respondents’ locations as they combine the use of social 
media and other data with survey results. GPS can be used to 
observe behavior patterns, look at how people use the mobile web 
when they’re out and about, and send relevant surveys to partici-
pants based on their locations. Their Research Lifestreaming ser-
vice has already tracked more than twenty million Facebook posts 
from twenty thousand participants in the United States.
Monitoring subtle social signals is now possible thanks to 
mobile devices. Professor Alex (Sandy) Pentland and his col-
leagues at MIT have invented a “sociometer,” a specially designed 
digital sensor worn like an ID badge that monitors and analyzes 
social interactions among groups of people. In his book, Honest 
Signals, Pentland suggests that by “reading” our social networks 
with these devices, “we can become more successful at pitching an 
idea, getting a job, or closing a deal.” These devices are also being 
used to research how people interact with one another.
Mobile Field Research in Agriculture
The term “field research” takes on new meaning when we look  
at all the possible uses of mobile devices in agricultural research. 
Of course, making sense of a large amount of data needs a place 
where the data can be collected and analyzed. The U.S. Department 
of Agriculture, the U.S. Geological Survey, and researchers at 
Colorado State University have developed an object modeling sys-
tem (OMS) that allows data collected in the field to be analyzed 
against the OMS model. Jason Smith (2011), writing in the Compute 
in Motion blog, talks about how this works:
[A]n agricultural researcher might look at a field and try to glean 
clues about erosion and rainfall to better map conservation direc-
tions. With the help of a mobile phone’s GPS, the coordinates of the 

using mobile devices as research tools     169
researcher’s location are sent to a modeling service hosted in  
the cloud to calculate soil erosion and other agricultural elements 
based on any number of given conditions. Within that remote 
resource, the coordinates will be matched to stored information 
about the nature of the area in question. Furthermore, as more is 
known about particular areas on the map, more information will be 
added to the cloud service’s well of geological, agricultural, hydro-
logical, and other data.
As more and more farmers use mobile devices to document 
and manage their farms, or the food distribution chain tracks 
the location and condition of food from field to table, the mass 
of data collected will be mined by agricultural researchers in the 
near future. Whether we like it or not, we are all crowdsourcing 
for someone’s research as our movements and actions are tracked 
and documented.
Mobile Research in Healthcare
The potential of using mobile devices and networks to track dis-
eases and therefore do research on how and where they spread is 
now well recognized. The SARS outbreak of 2003 resulted in hun-
dreds of deaths and billions of dollars in economic losses. There was 
evidence of this disease on the Internet as early as November 2002.
Since that time, the tracking of diseases and disasters through 
mobile technologies has improved greatly. A mobile phone–based 
health program called Alerta DISAMAR allows Peruvian military 
doctors to report disease outbreaks and ask for help with treat-
ment. Laboratories that test for diseases, traditionally isolated 
from each other, are now being connected by computer networks 
in order to share results and to integrate the inflow of data about 
diseases. This ability is invaluable to epidemiologists.
Many other examples of mobile research in healthcare are 
available. Health information is changing the ways drug makers 
develop medicines and communicate with doctors, insurers, and 
patients. Information from patient records is helping companies 
design more cost-effective clinical trials and tailor marketing mate-
rials to the people who most need them. For example, mobile 
phone software can help patients find clinical trials for cancer or 
track blood sugar levels.

170    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Mobile Research and Citizen Science
A 2005 project with school students in the U.K. called Mudlarking 
in Deptford (FutureLab, 2005) showed how mobile devices can 
involve anyone in the collection and transmission of data as part of 
personal research or crowdsourcing. Mobile computing is one of the 
technologies that have fueled the rise of “citizen science” in which 
any person with an interest can become a dedicated researcher.
“Citizen science” is already happening in a big way, aided by the  
widespread distribution of smart phones and, more recently,  
the explosive growth of adoption of tablet computers. For exam-
ple, the What’s Invasive? Project uses community data collection 
with mobile phones to locate and track invasive weeds that are 
threatening native plants and animals in several different locations 
in the world. Other citizens are gathering information on pollu-
tion sources, identifying birds, or plotting bicycle use, and feeding 
their data into applications that analyze patterns from this infor-
mation. Researchers in the SixthSense project at MIT are building 
prototypes for wearable devices that will automatically collect data 
as the wearers move around their environments.
We are just beginning to scratch the surface for the use of 
mobile computing in research. Mobile learning has become a two-
way activity.

Performance Support as a 
Form of Mobile Learning
Gary Woodill
One of the most frequent themes in discussions of mobile learn-
ing in the conference sessions and workshops that I give is a 
debate about whether or not “performance support” is a form of 
mobile learning. People who argue that it is not seem to think 
that learning is something that only happens as a result of instruc-
tion or study, and not something that can happen on the job or 
through a search by a learner. But learning is something that takes 
place at any time and in any location where a person has discov-
ered something new, no matter what the source or circumstances. 
Therefore, we need to consider performance support that is deliv-
ered through mobile devices as a form of mobile learning.
The vision of mobile learning being used as a form of performance 
 support goes back to some of the first publications on mobile learn-
ing. Diane Gayeski, in her 2003 book Learning Unplugged: Using Mobile 
Technologies for Organizational Training and Performance Improvement, 
certainly advances the case for mobile learning as performance sup-
port. Performance support can be delivered using mobile devices in a 
number of ways; the two most common approaches are the provision 
of “job aids” and the availability of mentors via mobile devices.
Making job aids available on mobile phones and tablets. Given that 
most of us have mobile phones, and more and more of us have a 
tablet computer, it is not surprising that some analysts see giving 

172    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
just-in-time assistance to employees as they need it as a service that 
will become common in the near future. Job aids are especially 
appropriate for a mobile workforce. On the road, there is often 
a need to find out a specific answer to a question, look up a set 
of directions, or refresh one’s memory about a certain process. 
Sometimes, in emergency situations, we are called upon to carry 
out procedures for which we have no training. A mobile device 
can be very useful if it contains a set of instructions that we need 
or if we can contact an expert at another location who can guide 
us through the emergency situation. Already, there are examples 
of this in the medical field where a doctor who was not trained 
in a particular procedure was able to perform it by receiving text 
messages from a colleague who was familiar with the operation.
Setting up mentoring, support, and cognitive apprenticeships. As we 
move away from the classroom model of training, learners often 
need mentoring, psychological support, and direction in terms 
of what they need to know in the workplace. Instead of being 
removed from the real job situation where knowledge is needed, 
mobile communications allow expertise to be available to the 
learners as they are performing a task. There are many exam-
ples of the use of mobile communications for just-in-time perfor-
mance support and coaching, especially in the field of healthcare 
and medicine. The United Nations Foundation reports that the 
National Leadership and Innovation Agency for Healthcare intro-
duced a radical approach to mentoring using social networking 
with guided learning principles. The University of Southampton’s 
MPLAT Project supported healthcare students in clinical place-
ments with a mobile learning toolkit that included practice-based 
learning, mentoring, and assessment using mobile devices.
In New Zealand, Chan and Ford (2007) describe how appren-
tice bakers are supported in the workplace with mobile learning. 
The program uses text messaging to disseminate the results of 
both summative and formative assessments. The apprentice bak-
ers use their mobile phones to take photos, videos, audio, and 
text evidence of their workplace skills, and assemble an e-portfolio 
for later assessment by faculty. The whole system is tracked and 
reported using Moodle, an open-source learning management 
system. Similarly, workers in the oil sands industry in Canada can 
take courses from Keyano College through a mobile electrical 
apprenticeship program. This allows the students to continue 

performance support as a form of mobile learning    173
working through their apprenticeship with no increase in their 
living expenses. The employers have the benefit of a steady work-
force of highly skilled workers.
At the ICEL conference in New York in 2007, a team from 
Denmark (Bertelsen, Kanstrupand, & Christiansen, 2007) pre-
sented a checklist for evaluating personal digital assistants (PDAs) 
as performance support to medical professionals. They said:
The checklist facilitates the communication between designers and 
innovators throughout the development of . . . a prototype, dubbed 
“e-pocket” [that] is supposed to replace and expand the support 
which inexperienced but professional physicians normally get from 
carrying books, paper slips, and personal notes in their pockets, 
when on duty. The checklist addresses the key issue in developing 
professional competence: how to integrate formal rules of proce-
dural and declarative knowledge with personal experience of  
problem-based learning.
There are other examples of mobile learning being used for 
performance support, but this concept is just in its infancy. Watch 
it grow as our ideas of learning and support change in the next 
few years.

Mobile Learning 
in “Third Spaces”
The Move to Alternative Workspaces
Gary Woodill
Mobile computing has had a major impact on the lives of many 
workers, who now work at home as independent contractors or as 
telecommuting employees, hardly ever showing up at a traditional 
office to do a 9 to 5 job. As a consultant, I often work online with 
colleagues and clients from all over North America, and occasion-
ally from other parts of the world, and also find myself working on 
the move, using my mobile devices to work and stay connected with 
clients and colleagues, who also may be anywhere in the world.
There are advantages and disadvantages to this shift in the 
location of work, but there is no denying that this is a growing 
trend. One of the major downsides to working at home or by your-
self in a hotel is the sense of isolation from other workers. And 
many independent knowledge workers don’t have the space or 
privacy to effectively work at home, especially if other family mem-
bers (or noisy pets) are also in the house during the day. With a 
home office, there is no real work-related socializing, except per-
haps with a spouse or other family member. There’s usually no 
sitting back and saying, “What do you think of this?” or “Can I 
bounce this idea off you?” Often, there’s no one asking for your 
advice. No creative side trips. No impromptu informal learning.

176    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
One solution is the use of “third spaces,” alternatives to home 
or a traditional workplace, such as cafes, libraries, and commu-
nity centers, where you can use mobile tools to connect to others.  
I can sometimes be found working at the train station in Toronto, 
using a laptop connected to the free wireless Internet connec-
tion available from the railway company. Or I can sometimes be 
found working at a coffee shop using a USB stick to connect to the 
mobile phone network for online service. Yet, there is something 
missing in these nomadic sanctuaries. It is the contact with others, 
the everyday banter, exchange of gossip, and assistance from inter-
ested colleagues that occur in the traditional office environment.
Co-working is a solution that has been developed to address 
this problem. You still can work for yourself (or remotely, away 
from a central office), but not always by yourself. Co-working  
is about building a community of people who work together. It’s 
not about finding “office space” and renting out spaces.
Co-working is redefining the way we work. The idea is ­simple: 
independent professionals and those with workplace ­flexibility 
work better together than they do alone. Co-working answers the 
question that so many face when working from home or on 
the road: “Why isn’t this as much fun as I thought it would be?” 
Beyond just creating better places to work, co-working spaces are 
built around the idea of community-building and sustainability. 
Co-working centers agree to uphold the values set forth by those 
who developed the concept in the first place: collaboration, com-
munity, sustainability, openness, and accessibility.
There are many benefits of co-working. When working by 
oneself, there is a tendency to continue working without taking 
breaks, because there is no one else to talk with. Co-working 
re-humanizes work, while allowing workers to maintain their inde-
pendent status and/or entrepreneurial spirit. Bringing a group of 
people together makes collaboration easier, builds social ties that 
extend into the community, and allows the sharing of resources 
that are often too expensive for an independent worker to buy 
and maintain.
This arrangement seems ideal for knowledge workers, mobile 
workers, and creative people who are trying to earn a living from 
what they produce. There is value, too, in a “many jobs loosely 
joined” setup, where it is easier to meet the needs of a large client 
organization that no one person could easily handle. But co-working 

mobile learning in “third spaces”  177
is not just for the self-employed; people working as full-time or 
part-time employees, contractors, and entrepreneurs can all enjoy 
co-working.
Camaraderie, a Toronto co-working location, has this message 
on its website:
Welcome to Camaraderie! We are a shared office space for entre-
preneurs, freelancers, independents, and any form of digital 
nomad that is looking for a vibrant community and a space for 
collaboration. We have combined the best elements of café culture 
with a productive, functional work environment that is affordable 
for startups to gain ground and succeed. Camaraderie is the spirit 
of friendly good-fellowship, an apt name for an open, shared facil-
ity where being a lonely freelancer is yesterday’s news and today’s 
entrepreneurs usher in the future.
Co-working is a global movement. There is even a Co-Working 
Visa Project, where you can use office space in a city that you are 
visiting, in the spirit of sharing and reciprocity. Essentially, it is 
an exchange program where, if you are a member of a partici-
pating co-working center, you can work for up to three days at 
another participating co-working center without having to pay 
additional fees. There are now participating co-working centers 
in thirty-eight states of the United States and in an additional 
sixty-two countries. An online co-working directory lists more than 
twenty co-working sites in Canada, from Victoria to Halifax. The 
list is growing each month.
While the initial co-working movement is mainly about shar-
ing physical spaces, one can apply the principles of co-working to 
the mobile world and reap many of the same benefits. I have col-
leagues in Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York City—my 
“virtual cubicle mates,” who show up to chat on Skype or Yammer 
on a regular basis. It really doesn’t matter whether my interactions 
are on my desktop computer or my BlackBerry, it is still contact. 
Many people form small groups on Facebook, just to chat on a 
daily basis. These groups often share skills sets (design, research, 
teaching, graphics, authoring, etc.), conversation, and support—
the essence of co-working in a virtual space. There’s a great deal 
of informal learning taking place in both physical and virtual 
co-working environments. This is why co-working should be of 
interest to the learning and development community.

More and more workers work from non-traditional sites, usu-
ally from their homes. This is good for the environment, reduces 
time wasted in commuting, and often increases flexibility to bet-
ter balance childcare, work, and social activities. At the same time, 
we all need to learn from each other and to be connected in a 
satisfying way to other people who understand and are ­willing to 
talk with us about what we do. Co-working is a growing trend that 
makes a new world of mobile work and mobile learning possible.

The Impact of Mobile Learning 
on Assessment and Evaluation
Gary Woodill and Chad Udell
There are many, many ways to assess and evaluate learning. But, 
for most people, assessment and evaluation are all about testing—
answering questions in multiple-choice format or essay style that 
are then marked, usually by the same person who created the 
questions. What is often being assessed in typical paper-and-pencil 
tests is the memorization and recall of specific content that has 
been “taught” as part of a standard curriculum.
Because many instructional designers see mobile learning as 
a spinoff of e-learning, which, in turn, is based on a classroom 
model, they are inclined to develop the same traditional assess-
ment techniques, but on a smaller screen. So it is not a surprise 
that we can find examples of mobile quizzes, mobile grade books, 
and mobile polls and surveys. While there is nothing particularly 
wrong with this, it is a quite limited view of the potential of using 
mobile devices for assessment and evaluation.
If you are skilled and diligent, there are ways of using written test 
questions to assess learning objectives other than ­memorization—
especially higher order cognitive domain objectives, such as those 
identified in Bloom’s Taxonomy (Bloom, Engelhart, Furst, Hill, & 
Krathwohl, 1956)—comprehension, application, analysis, synthe-
sis, and evaluation. But tests are not a good way to assess affective 

180    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
and psychomotor domain objectives—those that include values, 
organizational skills, perception, and creativity. Assessment of 
these areas usually includes the need for human observation and 
recording of what a learner does. Often, assessing and evaluating 
complex emotions and skills requires that the learners be in a spe-
cific context, interacting with the environment that elicits these 
behaviors. Sometimes, that context is a group of learners, where 
the requirement that is being assessed is based on group behav-
iors or collaboration processes.
Two forms of assessment are generally recognized: formative 
and summative. Formative assessment evaluates people’s knowledge 
or performance while they are learning and provides feedback so 
that they can improve as they learn. Formative assessment can be 
used in adaptive teaching, varying the learning activities or mate-
rials available to the learner. Summative assessment generally comes 
at the end of a period of learning and summarizes learners’ prog-
ress to date in a particular area.
Advantages of Mobile Assessment
Mobile technologies are particularly useful for going beyond the 
assessment of memorization and other “lower order” cognitive 
skills. As Clark Quinn explains in his 2012 book, The Mobile Academy, 
with mobile assessments learners can capture their own perfor-
mance, whether directly or by measuring or recording it. He adds:
These can be brought back for self-evaluations and comment or 
instructor feedback. These stored performances can also serve as 
components of a portfolio to be coupled with other work products. 
Having learners perform or create and then annotate a version 
with their reflections and underlying thought processes involved in 
the creation or performance provides a valuable tool for evaluation 
of their thinking and begins to develop literacies beyond text, an 
important 21st century skill. (Quinn, 2012, p. 72)
There are further benefits in using mobile technologies for 
assessment. In a 1999 study in Germany of over nine thousand psy-
chometric tests, Rose, Hess, Hörhold, Brähler, and Klapp showed 
that “in comparison with paper-and-pencil versions . . . usage of 
mobile computer-assisted assessment reduced the time by two-
thirds spent on documentation, because data organization and 

THE IMPACT OF MOBILE LEARNING  181
accessibility for clinical, scientific, and educational needs were sig-
nificantly improved. Moreover, no differences in stability coeffi-
cients and data distribution were seen between the two methods.” 
In New Zealand, Parsons and Ryu (2006) identified ubiquity, con-
venience, localization, and personalization as additional benefits 
of using mobile assessments.
Mobile assessment represents a shift from old methods of sum-
mative assessment based on testing and grading, with its focus on 
individual achievement, to a new approach based on assessment 
information that has formative uses and is adaptive and learner- 
centric. The results of assessment become much more com-
plex and are based on the accumulation of evidence from many 
sources, using many different methods (Pellegrino, 2013). What 
is being assessed is now more dependent on the learners’ needs, 
context, and organizational requirements, rather than a standard-
ized set of facts that need to be memorized and retained, although 
some level of memorization will likely continue to be required. 
Pellegrino (2013) argues for an “evidence-centered design proc­
ess” and says that “a new generation of innovative assessments is 
pushing the frontiers of measuring complex forms of learning.”
The process starts by defining as precisely as possible the claims 
that one wants to be able to make about student knowledge and the 
ways in which students are supposed to know and understand some 
particular aspect of a content domain. While the claims one wishes 
to make or verify are about the student, they are linked to the forms 
of evidence that would provide support for those claims—the war-
rants in support of each claim. The evidence statements associated 
with given sets of claims capture the features of work products or 
performances that would give substance to the claims.
Mobile devices are ideal for capturing student input and col-
lecting evidence of processes such as problem-solving sequences 
or use of strategy in a game, for example. Leonard Low (2006) 
documents some of the many ways that mobile devices can be 
used to gather evidence for workplace assessments, such as:
•• Capturing images of evidence of competency using a digital 
camera,
•• Recording sound productions or interviews,
•• Note-taking by observers in the form of completion of check-
lists or observational rubrics,

182    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
•• Self-evaluation against competencies,
•• Maintenance of a journal of reflections on learning, and
•• Completion of quizzes or tests.
As Chad Udell documents in another chapter of this book, the 
number of different metrics available to measure behavior with a 
mobile phone is well beyond what can be provided by paper-and-
pencil tests and includes such new data types as location, move-
ment, and biometrics. The increase in the amount of data allows 
for new algorithms that can measure a student’s level of achieve-
ment, as well as predict what concepts he or she needs to learn 
next, based on performance. An adaptive teaching approach can 
then be used based on the large amount of data that is collected 
on each student. As devices become faster and more powerful, the 
possibility of real-time feedback as someone learns is close at hand.
Because of mobile devices, assessment and evaluation can now 
move directly into the workplace, and occur while the learner is 
actually doing his or her job (Coulby, Hennessey, Davies, & Fuller, 
2011). This is particularly useful in that an assessor can check 
whether, in fact, a learner is applying the concepts learned in a 
real-life situation. To quote Clark Quinn (2012) again: “The core 
of meaningful practice is application,” because “. . . the only sum-
mative assessment to care about is whether learners can ultimately 
perform to the desired level” (pp. 63–64).
Because the person who is doing the assessment and evaluation 
now has rich sources of data from multiple directions, a much more 
nuanced and complex picture of a person’s learning achievements 
and potential can be compiled. A recent study by Taylor, Dearnley, 
Laxton, Nkosana-Nyawata, and Rinomhota (2012) using mobile 
360-degree performance feedback tools with over nine hundred 
users in health and social care practice placement settings in the 
U.K. showed that mobile assessment produces a much more useful 
picture of each person and his or her interactions within a group, 
than previous methods of standardized testing could ever do.
The Near Future of Mobile Assessment
New developments in mobile technologies foreshadow even more 
changes in the use of mobile assessments in the near future. 

THE IMPACT OF MOBILE LEARNING  183
Computerized adaptive testing (and most smart phones and tab-
lets are powerful computers) is a special case of computer-based 
testing, where each learner takes an individualized and unique 
test tailored to his or her ability level. The process starts with the 
software giving the learner an item of moderate difficulty in order 
to assess his or her level. If it is answered correctly, the next item 
is harder. If the answer is incorrect, then an easier item is pre-
sented. Using this method, the knowledge level of a learner can be 
assessed very quickly. This approach has several other advantages, 
including allowing testing on demand using a mobile device, which 
means that a learner can take a test whenever he or she is ready. A 
variety of item types using multiple innovative forms of media can 
be used (Triantafillou, Georgiadou, & Economides, 2008).
Another recent innovation in mobile assessment mixes QR 
codes in with printed materials. The QR codes allow students to 
take a test regularly and receive immediate, constructive feedback 
as well as suggestions for review materials or additional resources 
(Lan, 2013). Two other recent innovations are assessment meth-
ods using automatic sensors (Trinder, 2012), and the use of the 
new Experience API (xAPI) and the concept of a learning records 
store (LRS) for recording and sharing of informal learning 
achievements.
Mobile devices are having an impact on assessment and evalu-
ation of learning, and further developments are on the way.

Design Thinking for Mobile Learning
Gary Woodill
Designing for mobile learning is somewhat of a jungle. That is, 
there are no easy answers to the question: “How do I design for 
mobile learning?” In our discussions with clients, we are often 
asked whether, in the training and development world, there is a 
learning theory or pedagogical system specifically developed for 
mobile learning, such as ADDIE or Dick and Carey. Unfortunately, 
for those who want quick answers and easy-to-follow formulas, the 
answer is “no.” At least not yet.
Instead, as learning and development specialists, we need to 
approach the problem as true designers—ready to work to identify 
the actual problem and come up with creative solutions that don’t 
just alleviate the symptoms. We live in a world of rapid change 
where many of the issues that arise in enterprise learning and 
development have never been seen before. With the development 
of mobile computing, we have a new toolset to develop solutions 
that we have never thought of before.

188    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
But it is not logical to start with tools before defining the 
dimensions of a project. What are the challenges and problems 
that a company is facing? Are these known issues with standard 
solutions that have worked in the past? Is mobile learning, in one 
of its forms, the obvious solution? Then apply these solutions and 
get on with solving the problems.
What if this is a unique problem a company is facing, for 
which there is no obvious solution? Then there has to be a more 
creative approach to problem solving, a process known as “design 
thinking.” Design thinking is a structured process to generating 
and developing new ideas. It has been articulated by IDEO, the 
well-known product design company headquartered in Palo Alto, 
California. The steps for design thinking advocated by IDEO are 
listed below:
	 1.	 Discovery—I have a challenge. How do I approach it?
	 2.	 Interpretation—I learned something. How do I interpret it?
	 3.	 Ideation—I see an opportunity. What do I create?
	 4.	 Experimentation—I have an idea. How do I build it?
	 5.	 Evolution—I tried something new. How do I evolve it?
The dean of the Rotman School of Business at the University 
of Toronto, Roger Martin, says that in order to innovate and win, 
companies need design thinking in addition to the quantitative 
management approaches that they traditionally have used. In his 

mysteries, heuristics, and algorithms   189
2009 book, The Design of Business: Why Design Thinking Is the Next 
Competitive Advantage, Martin says that knowledge advances from 
one stage to another—from mystery (something we can’t explain) 
to heuristic (a rule of thumb that guides us toward solution) to 
algorithm (a predictable formula for producing an answer). In 
a 2010 talk in Australia (http://vimeo.com/10452582), Martin 
elaborated on these three stages of knowledge.
In the Mystery stage, we are faced with questions and problem 
statements about which we do not have answers. This is the stage 
that many companies find themselves at today in regard to mobile 
computing in general. What can we do with these iPods we just 
bought? How can I use mobile learning for competitive advan-
tage? What new things can we do with the current state of technol-
ogy that we couldn’t before? What policies make sense in terms of 
employees’ use of their own mobile devices? There are no stan-
dardized answers here, just the possibility of creative answers if 
one wants to move forward. Early adopters and innovators set the 
stage here and plot new courses for others to follow.
In the Heuristic stage, those in charge of training and devel-
opment understand the possibilities of mobile learning, but still 
don’t have a strategy or understand how to put a comprehensive 
system together. Based on what they already know about learn-
ing technologies and the advice of newly minted mobile learning 
experts in the field, they are ready to try something and make it 
work. At this stage of mobile learning, much of what is going on 
is strategy development, experimentation, and pilot studies. The 
important thing is to find something that works, whether it is an 
elegant solution or not. By doing this, the company advances as 
key managers and trainers gain experience and learn the possi-
bilities of mobile learning. Mimicry or replication of previously 
successful cases can serve as a way to test whether a recipe may 
work for your organization.
In the Algorithmic stage, standard procedures and policies for 
mobile learning are in place for a specific company. Almost no 
one is there yet in the mobile learning arena. There are just too 
many things to try out and to learn in order to make mobile learn-
ing standard operating procedure. Yet, this is where many people 
want to start—and expect that consultants and vendors have the 
skills and information that will make this easily possible. Virtually 
no one’s current situation is enough like someone else’s to make 

190    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
a “mobile learning in a box” approach successful. They don’t 
want to go through the hard work of examining strategic busi-
ness problems, technology choices, and innovations in pedagogy 
or to undertake iterative trials of mobile learning within their own 
companies. But, without these early stages, implementing mobile 
learning may very well be a failure that impacts a company’s bot-
tom line. No reputable consulting company should suggest that 
it has solutions that don’t require going through the mystery and 
heuristic stages of knowledge development before settling into a 
comprehensive system.
As Roger Martin pointed out, the benefits of going through these 
three stages can be huge. The results are often a massive efficiency 
gain, and if your company is out there first, it can be rewarded by 
being a market leader. However, in this day and age things change 
rapidly, as new mysteries arise. So the process has to be started over 
again, if companies are not to lose their competitive advantage. As 
Clayton Christiansen (1997) has shown in The Innovator’s Dilemma, 
most companies that have a winning product are “one-hit wonders.” 
Rarely do they have multiple winning products or innovations that 
make them leaders in the next innovation cycle.
Right now, the field of mobile learning is moving from the 
mystery to the heuristic stage in that we are trying to figure out 
what problems it can solve and put together crude systems and 
­single-purpose apps to solve those problems. There are some suc-
cessful recipes, and even more unsuccessful ones, out there for you 
to review, learn from, and choose to replicate or avoid. Considering 
this further, mobile learning has not reached an algorithmic stage 
in that there are no standard procedures or methods that have been  
shown to get reliable results. That will come, but not before a lot 
more innovation and experimentation.

Ubiquity and Mobility as 
Design Considerations for  
Mobile Learning
Chad Udell
It should be abundantly clear by now that mobile devices are like 
no other technology we have ever created learning content for or 
placed in the hands of our employees. They are fundamentally 
different because they are always on, always near us, and always 
connected. How has this changed how you access information and 
interact with others? Try this quick statement on for size. You’ve 
probably said, “I’ll look that up the next time I’m online” once 
or twice if you have been an Internet user since the late 1990s or 
even early 2000s. Think about the last time you said that. It might 
be hard to remember when you struck that from your vocabulary. 
It likely corresponds to one of two primary events:
	 1.	 You installed reliable, easy-to-use wireless Internet access in 
your home.
	 2.	 You acquired a smart phone with a data plan.
With the first event, you still need to deliberately open up a 
laptop, boot it up, sign in, and then browse to find the informa-
tion you seek. But with smart phones being an arm’s length away, 
always on, and always connected to the web and other services, 
information that you need can arrive even before you request it.

192    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
The very concept of “the next time I’m online” is anachro-
nistic. It’s a bit like saying you will “tape a show” with your digital 
video recorder (DVR).
This shift is transformational. Are you taking full advantage of 
this change in your mobile learning efforts? If not, read on to find 
some ideas on how you can leverage this powerful new affordance 
of mobile devices.
Going from read-only access via a learning management sys-
tem at a prescribed location and time (at work, during business 
hours) to this new deliver information anywhere, any time mind-
set takes a bit of rethinking of learning and development’s role 
and approach to implementation for you, your team, and your 
organization. To start, consider how you can use these devices in 
the always on, always with you, always connected fashion already 
described.
Always On
I don’t know about you, but I almost never turn my mobile device 
off. I may restart it to apply an update or fix an issue that is occur-
ring, but the times I turn the device off are few and far between 
(and even more so, now that the FAA allows devices to remain 
on during takeoffs and landings). Even when I’m not actively 
using the device, it’s usually in standby or sleep mode, not fully 
turned off.
Contrast that with how I use a laptop. If I know I won’t need 
it for some time, I’m inclined to turn it off to prevent extra bat-
tery drain or fan/heating issues in its storage bag. Granted, I 
rarely turn my laptop off, but I know many people who turn their 
machines off every night and reboot every day, even though it’s 
not really needed anymore, with solid state drives and locking 
heads on hard disks (old habits die hard).
What do you gain when you have a device that is never turned 
off? Well, here are a few things that spring to mind:
	 1.	 Instant availability: You never have to wait to reboot and log in.
	 2.	 Information currency: You know that you will be able to receive 
updates as they happen.

UBIQUITY AND MOBILITY AS DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS    193
	 3.	 Replacing other devices and functions: Need a watch? An alarm 
clock? A calculator? A level? A camera? No need to hunt for 
one and turn it on when you have a multifunction device 
that is always powered up.
	 4.	 Dependability and familiarity: When you have something like 
this in your life, the tool becomes a vital part of the way you 
get things done and your daily routine.
How can you apply this design framework to your workplace 
information and learning content distribution? You can start by 
changing how you design access points to your content. Virtually 
any information on the web is two or three clicks away via a search 
in a browser on a smart phone or tablet (or a voice search away 
via Siri or Google Now). If accessing vital company content takes 
much more effort than that, you have some obstacles to remove. 
In the words of Conrad Gottfredson and Bob Mosher (2012), 
make your content no more than “two clicks or ten seconds” away. 
Anything much more than that, and not only are you not taking 
advantage of the always on nature of these devices, but you are 
driving your learners to other information sources that are easier 
to use and quicker to access.
Always with You
Most people check their mobile devices dozens of times a day—
according to Nokia, upward of 150 times a day. Mobile analyst 
Tomi Ahonen (2013) dissected this number in great detail on his 
blog, illustrating just how glued we are to these things. He added, 
“the mobile is the last thing we see before we fall asleep and the 
first thing we see when we wake up.” For many of my friends and 
family, myself included, I know this is true. I use my mobile phone 
as my primary alarm clock for waking when at home or on the 
road, and I usually check any social feeds right before I nod off 
for the night. In the morning, with my coffee, I use it to read the 
news and find the weather for the day. It is my informant, my assis-
tant, my planner, and news source all in one. How can it do all of 
this so well, and why can I depend on it so deeply? It’s because  
of the trust I place in it. Besides the spectacles on my face and the 
wedding ring on my finger, no other object gets as close to me or 
spends as much time with me as my smart phone.

194    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
It’s personalized. I’ve tricked it out, customized it. Added text 
tones and wallpapers. I have a connection to it, just as it is con-
nected to the network. Because of this, I can be more informed 
and smarter than I ever could have been without it.
Are you leveraging this closeness and personalization in your 
mobile learning? If not, you’re missing out on a powerful way to 
connect your audience to your content. Make it theirs, and they 
are more likely to want what you have to offer. Hand out the same 
thing on a big screen and see them walk right by it.
This isn’t about content being in the form of courses or non-
courses. It’s not even about performance support, job aids, or 
whatever you want to pin it on. This is about humanizing your 
content and making it fit the lives of users, not your needs as a 
designer or developer.
This is a fundamental shift in how we create our content. This 
requires research into topics like human computer interaction 
(HCI), user-centered design (UCD), design thinking, and user 
acceptance testing (UAT). It also requires abandoning some of 
our ego. Our users will show us the path, if we give them the ability 
to make choices and contextualize the experience to meet their 
own needs.
The depth to which these devices have already penetrated our 
lives is profound. People like them. You have a strong advantage 
here in your content-creation process. Create something employ-
ees like and deploy it on devices they like to use and always have 
with them, and you will succeed.
Always Connected
With 3G and now 4G/LTE networks, our mobile devices have con-
stant connection to the same web you use on your desktop or lap-
top computers. The same news, social content, games, and more 
are just a tap away. No longer confined to a computer in the den 
or a cubicle, information is always available. This is a boon for us 
in the information-delivery business. We don’t need our learners 
to come to us in a classroom or via a clumsy intranet site that only 
works on a specific outdated browser. No way. We can go straight 
to them via push notifications, email, messaging, and many more 
emerging channels like near field communication (NFC) and 
Bluetooth low energy (BLE).

UBIQUITY AND MOBILITY AS DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS    195
This changes the game in a lot of ways, but it does a few things 
especially well:
	 1.	 It meets the point of application of learning in a much more 
meaningful and powerful way.
	 2.	 It gives the learner a tremendous tool to use to find solutions 
when things go wrong.
	 3.	 It provides wayfinding and guides for when processes or 
tools have changed.
Beyond these three moments of need, the always-connected 
nature of these devices accommodate, for most of us and in 
most situations, the fact that most learning is simply unplanned. 
We simply don’t know when we may need to know something.  
As learning designers, we can take advantage of this. We don’t 
need to wait for the next time users access our content; we can 
send it to them based on contextual clues such as time, setting, or 
intent. With digital agents and AI, we can interact with employees 
and colleagues to help them before they even know they need it. 
Is staff fumbling about in a new application? Perhaps we can alert 
them to some contextual help available. Have managers just trav-
eled to a new company facility they haven’t visited before? Maybe 
you can offer to show them a map or check-in procedures based 
on their current location.
Without the always-connected nature of these devices, those 
sorts of performance support use cases seemed like sci-fi. Now they 
are almost second-nature for application designers and develop-
ers producing consumer products. In the training world, we must 
harness that type of thinking and bring it to our audience as well.
Entering the World of the “Three Always”
To assume the role of mobile learning master and leverage the 
always on, always with me, always connected power of these devices,  
consider the following:
•• You should expect your users to be able to access information 
they need and not have to go somewhere else, stop what they 
are doing, or change their focus to receive help.

196    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
•• You should expect your learners to use the company-provided 
mobile learning tools as their first line of defense.
•• You should consider your mobile learning content and 
­applications as a backstop that never fails.
•• You must acknowledge that turning to and using mobile 
­learning is not an admission of failure of training/learning, 
but rather the success of your designing great mobile tools.
•• Mobile learning isn’t about performance support in  
simple terms; it’s actually much more about augmenting  
every employee to make him or her the absolute best he or 
she can be.
•• Ponder this. Does Yelp look at the frequent use or access of 
its resources as a failure? Are return visitors to Wikipedia bad 
learners? If I need to check weather.com more than once a 
day, is this really all that bad?
To design learning with the “three always” in mind, start with 
these tips:
•• Simple read-only, lecture-style content delivery doesn’t cover 
this sort of access by itself, but can be augmented to do it by 
adding hooks for searching and smart indexes, tags, and other 
metadata.
•• This style of learning needs some user experience design—not 
just instructional design.
•• You must understand how, where, when, and why this content 
will be used. What are the use cases?
•• You must empathize with the learners. Understand how they 
access and why they access information.
•• Survey the users’ locations. Get in their shoes—literally travel 
with them during the definition phase of your projects if  
you can.
•• Put your content directly in their line of activity. Don’t require 
them to come to you.
•• Provide content to them before they need it and become their 
most trusted source of information.

UBIQUITY AND MOBILITY AS DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS    197
“Always available” is one of the most powerful aspects of 
mobile learning technology. Understanding how to put it to work 
for you will undoubtedly take some work, but when you do, your 
learners will be empowered, no matter where they are.

Design Considerations in 
Converting e-Learning to 
mLearning
Chad Udell
Converting content and moving from one type of learning tech-
nology to another are core requests we receive from visitors to our 
website, people who come to hear us speak, and clients who want 
us to do work for them. Upon initial consideration, it makes sense 
that people are very interested in this. After all, there is likely a 
wealth of content already in existence at your workplace that has 
been designed and approved for use in training your employees. 
Companies want to leverage existing resources and investment in 
the content they have produced.
In Learning Everywhere (2012), I wrote extensively about this type 
of mlearning content: “content converted from other sources.” I 
praised it for its ease of transitioning your company into a mobile 
learning–enabled organization. I also cautioned against wholesale 
content conversion or approaching this as an exercise in miniatur-
ization of content. It’s not just a simple exercise in shrinking the 
elements in your course to meet screen real estate requirements. 
You can’t really just move things around to make them smaller 
and expect that to work. In short, there is no big red easy button 
to make your move to mobile a simple, automated process.

200    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
A Plan for Transitioning Content
In making the move to the small screen with existing content, I 
recommend using these four main steps. Establishing a plan will 
help ensure success and reduce wasted efforts:
•• Assess your existing content for opportunities to go mobile.
•• Redesign your experiences to provide optimal learning 
solutions.
•• Be mindful of key considerations as you port content to 
mobile.
•• Remember what not to do when converting your content.
Each of these points will provide guidance and assist you in 
reaching your goal—a mobile learning–enabled workforce using 
the best content to help them do their jobs.
Assess Your Existing Content
We find that many people want to jump in and convert entire 
libraries of courses and job aids to mobile. In some cases, this 
could even be hundreds of modules built over a long period of 
time. This would, of course, be thousands of hours of labor if 
done correctly.
The thing I caution against, though, is that, without an under-
standing of the content you are converting and the ways in which 
it would be used when mobile, there could be a significant amount 
of wasted effort.
Before attempting to produce a replicated version of your 
library in a smart phone or tablet–accessible format, consider this. 
Will this content be made more useful when brought over to a 
mobile use case? If the information would rarely be accessed when 
the learner is on the go, you may be able to skip it. If the informa-
tion is best suited to ahead-of-time delivery and not really ready to 
move to a just-in-time process, perhaps you should leave it where 
it is or assign a lower priority for redesigning it.
You can gain insight into these issues by reviewing how your 
learners do their jobs and are accessing resources to help them. Do 
they have commonly printed out materials, Post-it Notes, or other 

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS IN CONVERTING E-LEARNING    201
reminders in their job area? Do they access intranet resources or 
other company web assets frequently?
Use clues like this to point you to the content in your library 
that should be brought over to mobile and made available to your 
workers while they are on the go.
Redesign Your Experiences
Another key aspect of the content conversion process to remem-
ber is that simply making the course or content compatible with 
your audience’s mobile device platforms is not likely to lead to 
successful uptake and ongoing usage.
You must redesign the user experience to match expectations 
of how mobile-optimized sites and services function. Up to this 
point, if you have come from an e-learning background, you have 
mostly designed linear experiences that heavily depend on the 
use of the Next and Back buttons for moving around and experi-
encing the content in modules you have created.
This works for new content and for experiences related to 
learning something for the first time. But what about for refresh-
ers or digging deeper to find an answer when you need it or when 
you are on the go?
Consider this example. If you were at home planning a trip 
and wanted to find a place for lodging and also some restaurants 
before you traveled, you might be happy to browse a website, 
clicking around and viewing things casually. However, if you were 
already on the road and needed to find a hotel and a place to eat 
before turning in for the evening, you would likely have a much 
different browsing strategy. You would depend more heavily on 
search, and you would also want answers to be arranged in a for-
mat that gave you the highest rated and closest items first.
Not only would you expect the user experience to change 
from your home or desktop computer use, but you would expect 
the interface to change, too. You would desire less focus on explo-
ration, more focus on directed content. You would demand more 
accessible searching and filtering. If the menu were inaccessible 
and you had to navigate the site completely linearly, you would 
likely abandon the site altogether. Take cues from the most help-
ful mobile sites you use when you convert your desktop content 
to mobile.

202    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
You must also adjust your user interface to be more “finger 
friendly.” The cursor on a computer is a far more precise interface 
tool than your finger. While it’s not uncommon to have buttons 
and other interactive elements that are no bigger than 7 to 12 
pixels tall on a computer experience, an interactive hotspot of 
that size on a touchscreen would be cumbersome to use. You must 
consider that a human finger has a touch point area of roughly 1 
cm in diameter and position elements accordingly.
This includes considering not just the space the items occupy, 
but also the negative space around the items. You must give your 
menu items and buttons room to breathe in order to prevent “fat 
fingering” the elements and allowing for easy interaction around 
potentially crowded areas on-screen.
Another area of user interface that will require adjustment is 
understanding that, with touchscreen input, there is an expecta-
tion that some things will change to make navigation easier for 
fingers. Keep in mind that smart phone apps are often navigated 
with one hand, while users hold the device and navigate experi-
ences with their thumbs. Also, swipe gestures and pinch and zoom 
style interface features are expected to advance through image 
galleries and navigate detail views, respectively.
User expectations also shift when you move to a mobile design 
paradigm. What would have been an acceptable mouse hover 
interaction to add engagement is not only annoying when people 
want information quickly, but also impossible on mobile devices 
because there is no hover state for interactions with elements.
Last, every screen or state in a mobile experience should 
be designed with a key interaction point or conversion point in 
mind. If the screen doesn’t basically scream, “Do this and don’t do 
this” from the elements you have chosen to put on-screen and the 
prompts or cues you have given the user, than you are probably 
not designing an effective user interface (UI). It should be virtu-
ally impossible to look at a mobile interface and be confused as to 
what you are supposed to do.
Be Mindful of Key Design Considerations
Mobile users are not only impatient, but they are also busy. Keep 
your content to the bare minimum needed to aid them, and offer 
more information only as an adjunct or for further reading. Don’t 

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS IN CONVERTING E-LEARNING    203
place obstacles in their paths that require users to listen to a com-
plete audio clip or pass through every screen in order to reach 
their final choices.
The objective, after all, is to provide the most useful content to 
them to solve an issue they may be having or to offer a refresher. 
Offering the supporting materials as an option or footer for a 
page is a great idea. Burying the content behind twelve “Next” 
buttons is not.
To help you do this, break up content and tag it for easier 
searching and browsing. Give your pages and areas descriptive, 
easy-to-decipher titles. Something like “How to Lay Floor Tiles” is 
far better than “Home Construction 12: Flooring.”
What Not to Do
We’ve focused on some adjustments you’ll want to make as you 
bring your content over to mobile. Here are some things you defi-
nitely don’t want to do.
Include Everything: When we produce classroom instruction or 
e-learning, there is often a habit to include an exhaustive inven-
tory of the content and all of the related information. This is often 
due to the fact that we expect that we will only have one chance to 
interact with the user. Mobile is almost always a repeat use case, so 
there is no need to take the kitchen sink approach so prevalent in 
other instructional design delivery methods.
Listen to Everyone: Here’s a joke for you: How many stakehold-
ers does it take to kill your mobile learning project’s productivity 
and delay your planned launch date? The answer: One less than 
you currently have on your project. It sounds farcical, but it’s true. 
Add too many people to the approval chain on a new technology 
like mobile delivery, and you are bound to have hiccups. Keep 
your project teams small and only include must-have team mem-
bers who add value to your efforts.
Force Artificial Deep Exploration: Requiring users to explore 
graphics, participate in every interaction you designed for a mod-
ule, or visit every screen in a course before it can be marked as 
complete can be seen as an engagement strategy on the desktop. 
Don’t bring this sort of interactive design over to mobile. Not only 
is this contrived form of engagement not effective in many cases 
on a computer, but it can seem downright hostile to a user who 

204    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
is looking for a vital piece of information when on the go via a 
mobile device. If your content is good and your experience is easy 
to use, you will have no issues engaging your users with your app 
or website.
Reinvent the Wheel: It is an unfortunate thing that we inter-
activity designers ignore tried-and-true methods for success and 
attempt to design completely new types of interaction models 
and design patterns. In the desktop world this can lead to poor 
usability, testing issues, and more. In the mobile world, it leads 
to those things, and, ultimately, user abandonment. We should 
strive to follow accepted user interface conventions and only stray 
when a specific use case is not supported adequately by existing 
user interface controls and design patterns.
The Last Word
I hope these tips have been helpful to you in your pursuit to bring 
existing content over to mobile.
Really, it seems to boil down to one key concept: Designing 
for mobile isn’t rocket science. Keep the user in mind, and you’ll 
do just fine.

The Importance of Curation for 
Successful Mobile Experiences
Chad Udell
It’s easy to see that web-connected smart phones (basically, the 
post-iPhone market) signaled the end of an individual being 
unable to answer the trivia question at the pub with a friend. 
Virtually any piece of information is available to an inquisitive 
user, no matter where he or she is located. In many ways, it also 
signaled the end of the “less is more” approach in terms of content 
curation for mobile learning that characterized the wireless appli-
cation protocol (WAP) days, due to low-speed connections and 
low-powered feature phones with limited input options. There is 
no question our phones have become faster, and our connections 
to the mobile web have, too. Why, then, is information retrieval 
time on task for mobile web content still lagging steadily behind 
the PC? The simple answer: We’re enamored with the power. 
The easy access to deep content anywhere, any time is making 
us drunk on information and makes it take far too long to access 
our end goals. A carefully crafted content strategy that includes 
curation as a core concept is crucial in helping the user find the 
right information.

206 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Consider Your Focus
Curation in relation to content strategy is the process of selec-
tion and presentation of the content that will be used by a mobile 
learner. How does a mobile learning strategy that includes con-
tent curation help? Think for a moment about the worst-case sce-
nario, the proverbial “drinking from the fire hose.” A real-world 
example: envision a content management system with more than 
200,000 unique nodes or pieces of information with all of it laid 
out for every visitor to the website, regardless of whether that user 
is using a PC or a mobile device. This type of content strategy or, 
rather, lack of strategy, creates the endless category tree user inter-
face (UI) design pattern and requires ceaseless querying to return 
the newly filtered result-set as the user traverses the information 
on a mobile device. This is a poor mobile user experience and 
should be avoided in order to make the user experience friendlier 
and more intuitive. The primary alternative to a browsing experi-
ence, the search, can be hit-or-miss, depending on your content 
indexing and the search capabilities of the platform being used. 
Relying on this as a key use case to overcome the flood of content 
is not wise.
Even on a smaller scale, this sort of content dump approach 
can be deadly for an optimal user experience. Consider the possi-
bility of putting a 200-slide PowerPoint deck used as a sales tool or 
performance support onto a mobile device. It’s a lot of content, 
sure, but is it the right content? You’ve probably had to endure 
a two-hour unedited and unsegmented video with no index, 
chapter points, or searchability. You may have seen a technology 
project executed that focused on providing unfettered access to 
a cavernous SharePoint server, with the producers of the content 
expecting a positive experience for users. The content dump 
approach can be an inexpensive way to go mobile, certainly, but 
the consequences are dire.
What is wrong with any of these scenarios? It should be obvi-
ous that, without having a clear concept of users’ goals, the unique 
context of their situations, a guide for their decisions, or use of 
curation to assist the content to bubble up in the right spots, it is 
going to be very difficult to achieve a successful user experience. 
Simply forcing an overabundance of content into a small screen is 
an untenable solution. Remember, a content strategy that doesn’t 

CURATION FOR SUCCESSFUL MOBILE EXPERIENCES  207
cull the content to meet the needs of the mobile user is ineffec-
tual. Not having curated content that allows a focused, directed 
experience is not economical from a total cost of ownership or 
lifecycle perspective due to lost productivity or sales, perceived 
failure, and damage to your brand. The bad, or even unsatisfying, 
user experience will cost users and lead to a possible redesign or, 
worse, killing of the project.
Research Paper Equivalents
So what should be done to make content usable and to make 
the user experience as pleasant as possible? The first step is to 
acknowledge the problem. You must recognize that the context 
for the mobile user changes the user’s content needs and desires 
dramatically. Often, PC-based access to content is to prepare for 
later requirements, and it is performed under less restrictive tech-
nical and physical constraints. The bandwidth is higher, the pro-
cessor is faster, the screen is bigger, and the user input is often 
more precise.
Mobile access, on the other hand, is done under a “micro-tasking” 
mindset: “Get in, get out, get on with your life.” You must under-
stand and design for the fact that accessing a wealth of uncurated 
data on a device is difficult. Input constraints, data throughput, 
and connectivity issues necessitate that you design and think dif-
ferently about your content. In the non-digital parallel, think 
about how these types of information and performance support 
tools work. At-a-glance reference cards, laminated phone direc-
tories, cross-tabulated mileage charts, and so on—these typical 
learning and development documents share a common thread. 
They are designed for easy, quick use on the go, and they contain 
only the information needed for the task at hand.
Some of the more advanced examples of these mobile refer-
ences you may have in your possession have index tabs, spinning 
discs with revealing die cuts, or other intelligently designed infor-
mation-revealing tools that allow the user to quickly filter a curated 
list of data or options. They may reveal deeper layers of informa-
tion, but only as needed and only by careful design. Consider how 
you can emulate not the physical design via some contrived skeu-
omorphic metaphor, but rather, capture the essence of the piece 
and translate it to a mobile user experience.

208 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Cull the Content
How do we get past this content access issue and provide better, 
more relevant user interfaces and experiences to our mobile 
learners? Even though we have rich service-oriented architectures 
(SOA) with deep data, a successful user interaction is as much 
about the irrelevant content we leave out as it is about the informa-
tion that is accessed. Content curation is vital to the mobile user 
experience because it provides focus and reduces time on task.
You must aim to augment, attempt to support, or intend to 
provoke a thought in providing your content. Assist the user in 
speed, accuracy, and safety in retrieval. The key is to cut the con-
tent until you have the minimum you need to provide true utility 
and timeliness. Consider this: Are you providing only actionable  
information to your users, or is there a lot of fluff along for the ride? 
What is the least amount of information you can provide and still 
be useful, providing real value to your audience? If you have more 
information available than this self-imposed limit, or if you are 
considering supplying more content or are getting pressure to dis-
play chart junk or useless metadata along with the real focused 
information, you must resist the urge to throw in the kitchen 
sink. Go back to the personas you have crafted, reread the use 
cases you wrote, and make sure that you haven’t over-served the 
content needs simply because you could or were receiving pres-
sure from sources not close enough to the real user goals.
In your next project try this: Resist the urge to “get it all out 
there.” Don’t let ubiquity in access cloud your judgment in shap-
ing the available information for your users.
Finally, get support! Mobile still needs curators. Don’t count 
them out just because you are no longer chained to a desk. Craft 
a curated experience and you’ll find engaged users able to locate 
the important information you want them to have.

Selecting Tools for Mobile 
Learning Development
Chad Udell
One of the first questions I am asked when approached by learn-
ing professionals is: “What software should I learn to make mobile 
learning websites and apps?” My answer is usually greeted with 
some confusion. “All of them, none of them, any of them,” I say. 
It’s okay. I’m purposefully being coy.
The real answer is that a single software solution won’t save 
you. There is no magic program that creates the ideal mobile 
learning experience for your users. The latest version of whatever 
you use to produce e-learning may be able to output content for 
mobile. I am not disputing marketing claims by software makers 
here, nor is that my intention in this chapter.
We need to learn less about the tools we use to output our content 
and more about the processes, practices, and the purpose behind 
the design and development of the content. We are moving, in some 
ways, to a model more akin to web design, web development, and 
information design. Bob Mosher and Conrad Gottfredson’s (2012) 
mantra of “Two Clicks and Ten Seconds” rings true in mobile design, 
just as it does in desktop-focused electronic performance support sys-
tems. We are designing experiences for the enablement and informa-
tion augmentation of the learners. We are creating experiences that 
provide the information they need to know at a specific moment, as 
well as directing the users to the deeper content that leads to knowl-
edge transfer and retention.

210    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
For this reason, software and tools alone will not save you. 
You will now have a lot in common with the designers of news 
sites, travel sites, restaurant guides, and the rest of the World 
Wide Web community. With this bag of tricks, you need to pre-
pare for changes. As new technologies, processes, and platforms 
are needed for mobile learning creation, it’s clear that we need to 
reexamine the roles and skills we have represented on our teams 
and find where we may have gaps.
Instead of sending your teammates to a two-day boot camp on 
software products, I recommend a more comprehensive approach 
to growing your skills. Some areas I think that you may want to 
look into are explained below.
Information Architecture (IA): Information architecture is a dis-
cipline that has been in place on the web and in the interactive 
design world for some time. It is the art and science of organizing 
and labeling websites, intranets, online communities, and soft-
ware to support usability. This is a new area of practice for most 
learning professionals, but one that many instructional designers 
can adapt to with some study and preparation. I know that it’s a 
few years old, but I still love Information Architecture for the World 
Wide Web (2006) by Rosenfeld and Morville on this topic.
User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX): More than graphic 
design, user interface design and user experience design are core 
skills needed for effective development and building of mobile 
apps and websites. An instructional designer, who in the past was 
often tasked with creating user interfaces for e-learning, will defi-
nitely be tested here. The role of a UI designer for mobile experi-
ences is less about creating interfaces to explore and more about 
creating interfaces to facilitate information retrieval and task 
completion. For further reading on this, I recommend picking up 
Steven Hoober and Eric Berkman’s excellent resource, Designing 
Mobile Interfaces (2011), or Josh Clark’s slightly older, yet indispen-
sible text, Tapworthy (2010).
Curation and Content Strategy: With social media playing such 
a crucial role in mobile learning and informal learning’s growing 
importance, it’s clear that much more content will be available 
to learners than is truly useful. You must learn to cull the waste-
ful content and curate the very best information to make mobile 
experiences focused and beneficial for your audiences. The book 
Curation Nation (2010) by Steven Rosenbaum may help you see 
where you need to beef up your skills.

selecting tools for mobile learning development    211
Software Development: Mobile development tools and practices 
are distinctly different from the practices with which you are 
likely familiar. While rapid tool vendors are making strides here, 
you would be well served to train your development staff on the 
HTML5 specification and how to author using native code (pri-
marily Objective-C and Java due to their prevalence in iOS and 
Android development, respectively), instead of waiting for the 
rapid software tools to play catch-up. The real takeaway from this, 
in my opinion, is that you, as a learning designer and developer, 
may be better served finding a partner in your organization’s 
technology group or a trusted vendor to help you with the final 
development of your products. You, after all, are likely a learning 
technologist, not a computer scientist.
These are all vastly different skills than you are likely to pos-
sess. What do you think? Have your thoughts shifted on what it 
takes to produce true mlearning?

Instructional Design Patterns 
for Mobile Learning
Gary Woodill
The use of mobile learning tools, processes, and procedures is not 
a guarantee of effective learning, because, like all tools, they can 
be used either well or ineffectively. At the present time, there is 
no coherent instructional design theory to guide the creation of 
mobile learning content. At the same time, pragmatic executives in 
large organizations demand proof that mobile learning can effec-
tively and efficiently produce desired outcomes. It is clear that tra-
ditional training methods such as ADDIE or Dick and Carey were 
not designed for the realities of mobile learning. In fact, ADDIE’s 
adequacy has recently come under fire (Bichelmeyer, 2004; Gram, 
2009; Wagner, 2009), and many alternatives, such as the successive 
approximation model (SAM) and others, have been proposed 
(see Kapp, 2006, for a list), but none address mobile learning.
One alternative approach that should be considered is the 
adaptation of instructional “design patterns” in mobile learn-
ing, identified by reverse engineering successful case studies. An 
instinctive tendency of most designers when approaching a new 
project is to ask: What’s worked in the past? What are others doing 
right? How can I leverage existing best practices? Finding and ana-
lyzing relevant case studies is a worthwhile endeavour, as it serves 
to determine which companies are using mobile learning, their

success rates, and how they are using it, in order to gauge what 
might work in similar settings and circumstances.
Already, several articles and at least three books have been 
published on the design pattern approach. Technology-Enhanced 
Learning: Design Patterns and Pattern Languages (Goodyear & 
Retalis, 2010) contains eighteen chapters on this new approach 
to instructional design. Diana Laurillard’s 2012 book, Teaching 
as a Design Science: Building Pedagogical Patterns for Learning and 
Technology, discusses a variety of learning and teaching patterns. 
Also, the Pedagogical Patterns Project (2012) has recently put out 
a book of readings for educators. But none of these books specifi-
cally discusses design patterns for mobile learning.
Background
The idea of design patterns comes from the field of architecture, 
when Alexander, Ishikawa, and Silverstein (1977) defined them as 
a technique that “describes a problem which occurs over and over 
again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solu-
tion to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a 
million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.” The 
related concept of “pattern languages” refers to a set of design pat-
terns that work together to generate more complex interrelated 
solutions. Design patterns have their roots and strong precedents 
in the software development and web design fields as well.
The fact is that no one method of instruction exists for teach-
ing all concepts or for facilitating learning. Laurillard (2012), for 
example, identifies five broad types of learning, all of which can 
be supported by mobile learning:
•• Learning through acquisition
•• Learning through inquiry
•• Learning through discussion
•• Learning through practice
•• Learning through collaboration
The appropriate design pattern to be used depends on the type 
of learning that is needed, which points to the best design approaches 
to be taken. At the same time, an instructional designer must take 

Instructional Design Patterns for Mobile Learning  215
into account the various strengths and weaknesses of available learn-
ing technologies, choosing those that are the most likely to support 
the successful delivery of desired learning outcomes. Mobile learn-
ing technologies have many strengths, but they are not the most 
effective or cost-efficient solution for every learning situation.
In Table 33.1, I have adapted and expanded Laurillard’s list by 
matching learning outcomes with specific design approaches that

make sense. This listing is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather 
to show that instructional design is about deciding on the best 
ways to help a learner or a group of learners achieve a specific set 
of learning outcomes. One size definitely does not fit all.
When looking for the ideal learning approach for a group of 
learners in a specific environment, design patterns can be useful 
for suggesting a set of instructional design ideas, which can then 
be modified to suit the circumstances and the characteristics of 
the learners. This is especially useful when a learning develop-
ment team does not have an in-house designer to develop cus-
tom instructional designs, or when efficiency of development is 
paramount.
To develop or identify a design pattern, it is helpful to find 
successful case studies that have similar outcomes to those that 
you are trying to achieve. Then, ask a set of questions to draw out 
the design pattern in such a way that you can use it again or eas-
ily modify it according to changing circumstances. The list below 
is an adaptation of questions that Laurillard (2012) asks in her 
book, offered here as a template that can help to analyze a case 
study involving the use of learning technologies.
Technology-Enhanced Learning Design Patterns Template
	 1.	 What is the basic design pattern? (Give it a name based on 
the broad learning outcomes and technology being used, 
and describe it in a couple of sentences.)
	 2.	 What features of the learning technology are useful for 
learning? (I refer to these features as the “affordances” of 
the technology. What problems can the use of this technol-
ogy solve?)
	 3.	 What are the “human factors” for deciding why and how this 
particular learning technology should be used? (Describe 
the purpose of the learning program, the experience level, 
and physical, cognitive, and emotional characteristics of the 
learners.)
	 4.	 What equipment or settings do you need to use this technol-
ogy? (Describe the learning site and equipment needed.)
	 5.	 What are the limitations or problems with using this technol-
ogy for learning? (All technology has limitations.)

Instructional Design Patterns for Mobile Learning  217
	 6.	 What external influences can affect learning while using this 
technology?
	 7.	 What does the learner do while using this technology?
	 8.	 What is the role of the instructor/designer in using this tech-
nology for learning? (What is needed to prepare materials 
and what does the instructor/designer do while the technol-
ogy is being used?)
	 9.	 What is the nature of the educational content used with this 
technology?
	10.	 How can this case study be extended to other circumstances 
and learners?
Adapted and expanded from Laurillard, 2012.
In order to make this real, let me work through a mobile learn-
ing example, a case study of the use of podcasting, taken from my 
book The Mobile Learning Edge (2011). In Chapter 4, I describe how 
Cognizant, an e-learning company in India, supplied its employees 
with iPods as a gift in order to provide instruction in English using 
a mix of podcasts and classroom training. Employees loaded a set 
of “learning nuggets” on speaking English onto iPods for their per-
sonal use. The employees were also supplied with additional reading 
materials, were required to attend a five-day classroom session that 
provided an overview of mobile learning as well as some English 
instruction, attended an online follow-up session for reinforcement, 
and took an online audio-based assessment consisting of listening and 
comprehension tests. This blended program was highly successful, 
making this case study a good candidate for analyzing its design pat-
terns. There was a significant rise in learner satisfaction, program 
completion rose from 50 percent to 80 percent, and the time spent 
in learning activities increased from eleven hours to twenty-seven 
hours per month. The number of employees passing the final assess-
ment for the program jumped from 70 percent to 83 percent, and 
the ROI was a cost saving of about $26,000 per month.
Analyzing a Mobile Learning Case Study
The Cognizant learning and development department used sev-
eral different approaches to reach their objective, which was “to 

218 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
improve the conversational skills of associates through the use of 
a non-traditional, informal learning medium.” The training pro-
vided by Cognizant was a blended approach, but for the purpose 
of illustrating the analysis of design patterns, we will focus on the 
use of iPods for teaching English.
Let’s use the questions above as a template to look at how the 
mobile learning design pattern worked.
	 1.	 What is the basic design pattern?
•• Podcasting—Listen to iPods or MP3 players in order to 
learn new information. The approach is based on the 
design pattern of lectures, but adapted to work with 
new technology, allowing information to be presented 
differently.
	 2.	 What features of this learning technology are useful for 
learning?
•• It is mobile, can be used to push content, play rich media, 
and learn through listening and/or viewing.
•• Podcasts can be listened to on mobile devices or laptop 
computers, allowing learners to move around while learn-
ing, as well as learn in a greater variety of locations.
•• It is scalable—the number of learners in the class is not lim-
ited by the use of the podcast.
•• The ability to pause the podcast allows learners to take the 
course at their own pace, thus encouraging them to work 
on it when they are motivated and focused.
•• Instructors creating the podcasts must try to make them 
engaging and clear in order to engage learners’ interest.
	 3.	 What are the “human factors” for deciding why and how this 
particular learning technology should be used?
•• The company wanted all their employees to improve their 
English verbal skills.
•• Employees spoke many native languages. For many, English 
needed to be improved in order to work in a global market.
•• Many employees wanted this new technology, and the fact 
that the company gave each employee an iPod as a gift 
increased motivation and positive feelings toward the project.

Instructional Design Patterns for Mobile Learning  219
•• Podcasts can be used while the learner is walking, running, 
or traveling in a vehicle. Learning using the iPods could 
take place anywhere, any time.
	 4.	 What equipment or settings do you need to use this 
technology?
•• To produce a podcast, you need a digital voice recorder.
•• In order to play it, you simply need an iPod, an MP3 player, 
or a computer with sound capabilities. Smart phones are 
also an option.
•• The physical setting can be anywhere, at any time.
	 5.	 What are the limitations or problems with using this technol-
ogy for learning?
•• Podcasts do not allow for interaction and feedback between 
the instructor and learners.
•• Learners may lose focus if the instructor’s voice is not inter-
esting. There is no guarantee that a learner will listen to 
and understand the information the podcast provides.
•• There are also difficulties when trying to present concepts 
that are best explained with visuals. Vodcasts (video pod-
casts) were created to fill this void.
•• Other aspects of the course would need to provide an ave-
nue for communication with the instructor.
•• Finally, it is difficult to search and find specific items in a 
podcast.
	 6.	 What external influences can affect learning while using this 
technology?
•• The learning will be unsuccessful if the learner is distracted, 
unmotivated, or uninterested.
•• Lacking the proper background information would also 
make it difficult to understand and benefit from the 
podcast.
	 7.	 What does the learner do while using this technology?
•• Learners must listen to the podcasts and absorb the infor-
mation or take notes.
•• The learners can imitate and repeat what they hear on the 
podcast.

220 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
	 8.	 What is the role of the instructor/designer in using this tech-
nology for learning?
•• Instructors prepared the podcast for the class and were 
available to answer questions in person or through confer-
encing software.
•• The podcast was used to supplement classroom instruction.
	 9.	 What is the nature of the educational content used with this 
technology?
•• Small audio files (“learning nuggets”).
•• The content is dependent on the course being taught.
	10.	 How can this case study be extended to other circumstances 
and learners?
•• Although ideal for learning languages, different types of 
organizational learning content and company information 
can be delivered using the iPod.
•• With available Wi-Fi plans, instructors/designers could push 
updated and additional content out to learners in the field, 
if using smart phone technology.
•• Podcasting for learning can be used by employees in almost 
any industry, especially when employees have non-produc-
tive time such as commuting or waiting.
Conclusion
As Ellen Wagner (2009) noted, “ADDIE isn’t a learning model 
[Wagner’s italics]. Nothing about it says ‘learning model.’ It’s a 
process model. It tells you what to do, in broad heuristic terms. It 
provides a systematic framework, a linear workflow.”
An instructional designer must still choose specific activities 
and tactics to encourage and facilitate a learner’s engagement in 
the completion of a specific set of learning objectives. Given that 
there are literally thousands of possible combinations of activities 
and approaches to this task, it seems a good idea that instructional 
designers develop their own catalog of learning design patterns 
that work. Once they have established a set of tried-and-true meth-
ods of instructional design, these can be shared, combined, and 
improved upon with others in a peer-based community approach. 
It is time to get to work developing mobile learning design patterns

ing field.

Creating Digital Publications 
for Mobile Learning
Heather Ford
It’s important to understand how to best publish learning mate-
rials for your organization’s employees. When creating a publi-
cation, you must understand the differences between the various 
output formats and tools you can use. What tools are best to create 
different types of publications? What are the differences among 
an EPUB, PDFs, and digital publishing?
With so many options out there, it could take a while to dis-
cover what the differences are for each competing standard. Here 
are some tips that will put you ahead of the learning curve as you 
assess your workflow and create your first publications.
When setting out to create any digital publication, there are 
some important differences to consider, such as what platforms 
the publication will be viewed on, the focus of the content, the 
appropriate design to reinforce your message, and other factors 
related to content and business strategy.
Only when this decision-making process is complete will you 
truly be able to determine the best tool to create the publication 
and whether any additional features or development efforts out-
side of the design should be included in the project plan.
Let’s begin by defining EPUB, PDF, and digital publications:

224    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
EPUB
The electronic publication format (EPUB) is one of the most pop-
ular file formats for e-books. An EPUB is similar in some ways to 
a web page, in that it is based on HTML markup at its core. It is 
an open and freely available standard that can be used by anyone. 
An EPUB e-book is simply an archive containing several other files 
stored together using the common.zip format (and then chang-
ing the file suffix to.epub). The files in an EPUB archive can 
include your words, images, tables of contents, style sheets, fonts, 
and details or metadata about a book, such as author or title.
EPUB’s standard format means your publication can be read 
on many e-readers or converted easily to other e-readers that don’t  
use EPUB directly. EPUB is a layout-agnostic format that allows  
the content to be read even on small screens. EPUBs can be 
created for and sold on iBooks and/or Amazon for the Kindle, 
among other monetization paths and digital publishing stores.
The EPUB specification continues to evolve. The current ver-
sion of the specification, 3.0, was approved in 2011.
PDF
A portable document format (PDF) is an open-specification file 
format maintained by Adobe that allows documents to be easily 
shared while retaining the same visual formatting. It is page-ori-
ented and has a static layout, compared with an EPUB, which is 
display-oriented and allows content to be dynamic. Although PDF 
files are read easily on computer screens, they are not compatible 
or very usable with many mobile devices that have smaller screens.
Digital Publications
Beyond standards like EPUB and PDF, a number of emerging 
“digital publication” formats are competing for adoption. These 
publications often focus around increased interactivity and a rich 
media display, eschewing flexibility in display for immersive and 
engaging design.
When creating a marketing publication, interactive elements 
that enrich the user’s experience, such as video, audio, slideshows, 
and animation, are beneficial. Coupled with attractive navigation 
design options, the layouts and structures possible are virtually 

creating digital publications for mobile learning    225
limitless. These formats are becoming familiar to users, since they 
are more and more popular in the publishing marketplace, with 
major publishers like Condé Nast getting on-board.
Authoring Tools
There are many different types of authoring tools to choose from 
when creating electronic publications. Some of the more popular 
tools out there are Sigil, Adobe Digital Publishing Suite, iBooks 
Author, and Adobe InDesign.
Sigil is a free tool that can be used to create EPUBs. The soft-
ware was designed to allow designers to easily create great e-books 
using the EPUB format, since the core of an EPUB is XHTML, 
SVG, and CSS.
Sigil has the following features:
•• Multi-platform authoring
•• Complete control over directly editing code
•• Table of contents generator
•• User interface translated into many languages
•• Supports import of HTML files, images, and style sheets
•• Documents can be validated
Adobe’s Digital Publishing Suite (DPS), Adobe InDesign, and 
Apple iBooks Author are examples of the tools you can use when 
creating a digital publication. These types of publications are great 
for magazines, catalogs, or immersive interactive publishing expe-
riences. Using a cloud service called Adobe Site Catalyst, you can 
perform marketing analysis on each publication’s usage, which you 
can use for custom HTML tracking, determining the number of 
issues downloaded and purchased. The Wikipedia article on EPUB 
contains a table listing popular electronic publication editing soft-
ware, with tools available for Mac and/or Windows platforms.
Content and Best Practices
No single set of best practices exists for creating all types of digital 
publications across the various platforms and delivery systems. It’s 
up to you to consider the different types of content you might 
have available or want to display when creating a publication. For 

226    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
example, a magazine, catalog, document, brochure, and book 
each has its own different set of best practices.
EPUBs are generally great for books, while PDFs are best for doc-
uments and brochures. If the content requires enriched interaction 
or is appropriate as a magazine or immersive interactive experience, 
then a digital publication is what you want. Greg Albers, an admitted 
critic of digital publishing methods, provides these useful tips:
•• Don’t add in fancy multimedia features just because you can.
•• Avoid giving written directions.
•• Consider limiting the scope of the content.
•• Consider making a secondary version to give your book/app a 
life and purpose beyond a single screen.
Tying It All Together
So what type of digital publishing end-product should you create? 
I hope, with the information you now have about the platforms 
and tools available, you’ll be able to answer that for yourself.
The correct platform choice depends greatly on the content 
you are designing for, the user experience you’re trying to create, 
and what type of market you are trying to reach. Once you deter-
mine these, you just need to choose the correct tool and delivery 
mechanism that can be used to develop the solution.
The information provided here will help steer you in the right 
direction and clear up any confusion on the differences among 
different publication methods.
Still a bit confused? Here is a summary table of the differences 
among EPUB, PDFs, and digital publications.

Designing for Multiple Screens 
in iOS
Daniel Pfeiffer
Devices running iOS now come in a pretty wide variety of flavors. Five 
different screen resolutions are available across four different screen 
sizes. Together, these account for the three different aspect ratios iOS 
developers have to take into account when creating an app.
The different aspect ratios generally don’t affect the core func-
tionality of an app, but it does directly affect how the user expe-
riences the functionality through the interface. With only three 
different aspect ratios, trying to handle the differences on your 
own requires a pile of hard-to-maintain conditional statements. 
Even the smallest of changes will become a time-consuming task.
Apple gives iOS developers a number of different tools to 
efficiently handle the various screen sizes and screen resolutions 
without writing a lot of extra code. Less code always translates to 
fewer bugs and time saved.
Let’s focus on one tool iOS developers have for efficiently 
designing layouts for multiple screens: autoresizing behaviors. The 
autoresizing behaviors have been around since iOS 2.0 but can be 
tricky to master, and it’s not always apparent how valuable they are.
iOS 6 introduced a brand-new interface tool for iOS devel-
opers called autolayout. Autolayout goes far beyond simply resiz-
ing views based on their superview and gives developers a layout 
engine that can intelligently position views based on relationships 

230 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
with siblings and the content of their siblings. Since autolayout is 
only available on iOS 6 and later, apps hoping to keep support for 
iOS 5 and earlier won’t be able to take advantage of the powerful 
new layout tool. Suffice it to say, it can do all that the autoresizing 
behaviors can do and much, much more.
Superviews and Subviews
When you think of the hierarchy of views in your application, each 
visible view always has a parent view or “superview.” Each interface 
element (for example, a UIButton) is placed inside of a UIView, 
which may be placed within another UIView, which ultimately is 
inside a UIWindow. UIWindow is the only interface item that does 
not have a superview, as it should be your topmost view.
When a view changes size, by default it will attempt to resize 
its subviews (and those subviews will in turn attempt to resize their 
subviews and so on). A view may change size for a number of rea-
sons: the device may have changed its orientation, the status bar 
or navigation bar may have just disappeared, or perhaps it was due 
to a custom animation. It also may change size due to the form 
factor of the device. In a universal application, you may design a 
view for the phone form factor with a width of 320px, but on the 
iPad, this view may display with a width of 768px or 1024px.
You can tune the behavior of the resizing action by setting 
the autoresizing properties of each interface element. This can be 
done in code by setting the value of the autoresizing Mask prop-
erty, but I find it far easier to manage these properties in Interface 
Builder, as it is more visual.
View Autoresizing
Let’s look at the Size Inspector in Interface Builder (View> 
Utilities>Show Size Inspector) to get our bearings with View 
Autoresizing.
Within the autoresizing options, you have six different tog-
gle controls that control the autoresizing behavior. There are two 
groups of autoresizing options: the margin controls and the size 
controls. For both sets of controls, a dotted line indicates that the 
control is disabled, while a solid line indicates that it is enabled.

DESIGNING FOR MULTIPLE SCREENS IN iOS  231
The controls around the outside modify the resizing behavior 
of the margins. “Margin” refers to the space around the top, left, 
right, and bottom of the selected view.
When any of these controls is enabled, it indicates to the OS 
that when the superview changes size, the selected view should 
reposition so that the view maintains a consistent margin from the 
edge of the superview. For example, if you place a label 10 pixels 
down from the top of the superview and you want the label to 
always be 10 pixels down from the top, regardless of the orienta-
tion or form factor of the device, you would enable the top margin 
autoresizing control.
When the control is disabled, it indicates to the OS that when 
the superview changes size, the selected view should move by the 
same ratio of the change in size. Let’s take the same label as 
before—still 10px down from the top of the superview, but this 
time, the top margin control is disabled. The superview changes 

232 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
height from 400px to 480px, a 20 percent increase in height. The 
top margin will also increase by 20 percent from 10px to 12px.
What happens if you enable all the margin controls but leave 
the height and width controls disabled? You’ve created a mutually 
exclusive scenario; the system cannot both satisfy positioning a view 
10 pixels from the left edge and at the same time 10 pixels from the 
right. The system gives precedence to the top and left. So in this 
scenario, it will honor the top and left setting, maintaining a consis-
tent top and left margin, but ignore the right and bottom setting.
The two controls in the middle control the autoresizing behav-
ior of the height and width of the selected view.
When one of these controls is enabled and the superview 
changes size, the selected view will also change size by the same 
ratio. A 20-percent increase in width of the superview will trans-
late to a 20-percent increase of width in the selected view. When 
disabled and the superview changes size, the selected view will not 
change size.
By way of application, let’s say you wanted a button to change 
its width with the superview so that it always has a 10px left and 
right margin. To achieve this, you would set the initial position of 
the button in Interface Builder, ensuring that there are 10 pixels 
both to the left and right of the button. Then, you would enable 
the width autoresizing control as well as the left and right margin 
controls. This indicates to the OS that you want the left and right 
margins to remain consistent and you’re willing for the width of 
the view to change in order to make that happen.
Using Autoresizing to Design for Multiple Screens
Table view cells are a great place to see the value in view autoresiz-
ing and how it helps you create a design that works at a variety of 
sizes without having to write a single line of code. Table view cells 

DESIGNING FOR MULTIPLE SCREENS IN iOS  233
frequently have to change height based on their content, but may 
also have elements that need to reposition when the cell changes 
size. Moreover, the cell may also need to resize based on the form 
factor of the device (phone or tablet) and the orientation of the 
device (portrait or landscape).
Let’s take a look at Float’s enterprise social network app for 
learning, Tappestry. One of the primary views in the app is the 
stream view where you can see posts (threads) created by yourself 
and other users. Each thread in the stream is a cell in a table view.
The thread cell has metadata about the thread at both the top 
and the bottom of the cell. The views at the top of the cell, the 
topic name, avatar, and name, all have the top and left margin 
controls enabled in the autoresizing options, because we always 
want them to be the same distance from the top left of the cell. 
The topic name and user name labels also have the width and 
right margin autoresizing control enabled, because when the cell 
is displayed on the iPad, we want the length of the labels to extend 
the full width of the cell, just as they do on the iPhone. The ava-
tar’s size should remain the same regardless of the size of the cell 
so it has the height and width autoresizing controls disabled.
The views at the bottom of the cell have to change position 
based on how tall the cell is. The height of the cell is dependent on 
a number of factors—not only the amount of content in the thread, 

234 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
but also on the width of the cell. The wider the cell, the less height it 
needs, since more text will be able to fit on one line. Without writing 
a line of code, we’re able to specify that the label containing the time 
the thread was posted should remain at the bottom of the superview 
(which is the cell). In this case, we have enabled the left and bottom 
margin controls. We have also enabled the width and right margin 
controls, since we want the label to extend the full width of the cell.
You can preview your autoresizing settings within Interface 
Builder by enabling Live Autoresizing (Editor>Canvas>Live 
Autoresizing). Now, when you resize a view in Interface Builder 
by dragging out one of the edges, Interface Builder will adhere to 
your autoresizing settings and resize the view’s subviews.
By mastering the autoresizing options, you can create interface 
designs that maintain consistent layouts, regardless of the size of 
screen they’re displayed on. Mastering these tools will go a long way 
in efficiently supporting the various screen resolutions of iOS devices.

Designing for Context
Chad Udell
In designing and developing any mobile application, it is criti-
cal to plan for the context for the use of the program being cre-
ated. What is context in terms of mobile application terminology? 
Simply put, it is the combination of time, setting, and intent for 
which the device is being used. The context component “time” 
refers to time as a specific “clock” time, but also perhaps as a rela-
tive time unit, as the proximity of an event to another occurrence 
of the same type of event. For example, your needs from your 
company’s intranet on or around a major holiday are different 
than they are on a typical Wednesday in August. Another exam-
ple: when you access an airport’s website on the day of your flight, 
you probably want different information than you want before you 
actually booked the flight weeks before.
The context component “setting” can refer to both social set-
tings and geolocational settings. The people and places around 
you directly affect how you access information, why you want to 
access it, and therefore what information is actually important at 
that time. A search on Google placed at a local pub in Chicago 
with friends for a bar bet or trivia game about movies is certainly a 
different setting than searching for that same topic when you are 
touring Hollywood on your daytime “map of the stars” homes tour. 
Likewise, a search for “restrooms in Yosemite national park” obvi-
ously requires a different result ordering based on whether you 
are in the park or are merely browsing the site and considering 

236    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
visiting there. Let’s hope the site’s designers are considering this 
for you, or you may need to find an alternate solution for your 
situation, and quickly!
The final component of context, “intent,” may be the most 
difficult to pin down and successfully design for at this time, 
largely because machines are, for the most part, dumb. Without 
explicit user input, your phone has no ability to understand why 
you are searching for a topic or browsing in a directory, even with 
its built-in sensors and indicators. There are algorithms that use 
combinations of mechanical indicators and sensors together to 
guess at your intent based on your past history, but it is still, at 
best, an educated guess. Software designers likely have one of 
their biggest challenges in trying to judge user intent. Artificial 
intelligence, smart agents, and expert systems all need to advance 
significantly before this can be accomplished.
How do you tackle these components in your mlearning design 
and development? Let’s try to lay out a sample approach here.
Producing an up-front definition of the user(s) or personas 
for your system is a crucial first step. This will help guide the 
use cases that determine how the system can be deployed. This 
requires vision, business strategy, and polling of stakeholders and 
subject-matter experts who have direct experience in the roles that 
you have tentatively identified as end-users. Unlike a use case for 
traditional desktop software or even basic web-based rich Internet 
applications (where the context is either not required or perhaps 
impossible to determine), describing the context and potential 
users for a mobile application is crucial.
Next, you’ll need to draft a requirements analysis or defini-
tion to create a list of key features that allow those use cases to be 
supported. This will require involvement by the developers creat-
ing low-level functional designs directly, with the user experience 
designer’s high-level designs dealing primarily with information 
architecture. These designs absolutely must take into consider-
ation the contexts that should have been written in the use cases.
After you have completed these steps, you have moved a long 
way toward designing a much more useful mlearning app for 
your users that supports their needs by being designed for their 
context.

Using Mobile Devices to 
Leverage Social Media for 
Learning
Gary Woodill
Aristotle wrote that “Man is by nature a social animal.” It’s built 
into our genes, as documented by E.O. Wilson’s new book, The 
Social Conquest of Earth (2013).
From birth, human beings experience themselves as individ-
uals embedded in a social group. Children who are isolated at an 
early age tend not to thrive. If they do survive, they become “feral” 
or “wild” children, usually without language or the ability to con-
nect with others. As Aristotle noted, we are all social.
Then why the recent concern on several websites, and in a 
number of keynote addresses, that social media and, by extension, 
social learning, “is dead”? Well, for one reason, using the word 
“dead” makes great attention-getting headlines. In this age of rap-
idly changing technologies, this idea is plausible simply because of 
the perception of the short shelf life of all technologies.
But this is a perception, based on vendors, writers, and consul-
tants all chasing the “next big thing” in order to stay ahead on the 
change curve. What really happens is that new technologies are 
exciting for a while and then fade into the media background as 
they become commonplace, taken-for-granted, and replaced by a 
newer shiny object. It doesn’t mean they are dead.

238    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Also, we tend to confuse “social learning” with the concept of 
“learning with social media,” which is what we are usually talking 
about.
What Is Social Learning?
Not surprisingly, the term “social learning” historically has several 
meanings, and the term has been reinvented with each new learn-
ing theory in psychology.
Behaviorist theories of social learning hold that people learn 
new behaviors via three methods: through overt reinforcement, 
through overt punishment, or through observational learning of 
social influences in their environments.
Early social learning theories incorporated behavioristic ideas 
that were current in the 1950s, but social learning has expanded 
beyond the focus of accounting only for observable individual 
behaviors to show how people learned by being embedded in a 
“social milieu.”
In other words, to understand the behaviors of an individual, 
it is important to consider the social context in which he or she is 
operating. People learn from each other, an idea that almost no 
one disputes.
The problem with behaviorism was that it refused to examine 
or discuss what was happening in the mind of an individual who 
was learning. It also reduced the behaviors being studied to small 
units of analysis that ignored influences beyond the organism (rat 
or human) that was being studied.
This led to the rise of “cognitivism” in the 1960s in North 
America and to neurological research that tried to connect phys-
ical brain activities with indicators of learning. It also gave rise to 
new social learning theories, such as constructivism, that refer-
enced both what was happening inside a person and the impact 
of the external social environment on learning.
Constructivist Theories of Social Learning
Although he is still not well known outside of school environ-
ments, the educational theory of Lev Vygotsky (1896–1934), a 
social psychologist who lived through the Russian Revolution, is 
very relevant for understanding social learning. Vygotsky’s work 

USING MOBILE DEVICES TO LEVERAGE SOCIAL MEDIA    239
has only become widely known in English since the publication of 
the translation of his major book, Mind and Society: The Development 
of Higher Mental Processes, in 1978.
Vygotsky’s social development theory states that social inter-
action is the foundation of human development, consciousness, 
and cognition. His followers use the metaphor of “scaffolding” to 
illustrate how our skills are built one upon the other, with the help 
of people around us. He calls those who know more than we do 
“more knowledgeable others” (MKOs) and shows how they have 
an important role to play in our learning.
His concept of the “zone of proximal development” (ZPD) 
is also interesting. The ZPD is the distance between a learner’s 
ability to perform a task under expert guidance, and/or with peer 
collaboration, and the learner’s ability to solve the problem inde-
pendently without assistance. According to Vygotsky, social learn-
ing occurs in this zone.
Good teachers know that effective teaching often involves 
assessing the current knowledge level of a learner and introduc-
ing materials related to the learner’s current knowledge that move 
the learner to “the next step” of what he or she needs to know. 
This is similar to the idea of scaffolding as articulated by Vygotsky.
But being social is not just a matter of having other people, 
more experienced than we are, teaching us what we need to know. 

240    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
The social aspect also occurs in the fact that we are embedded in 
a culture that we observe and where we act and share a common 
life with others. Language tools such as speech and writing are 
developed within a culture and carry meaning and concepts in 
their words. These words mediate the social environment through 
which each of us moves.
In contrast with the “instructionist” model of learning, where 
an instructor transmits information to students, Vygotsky believed 
that learners should play an active role in their own learning. In 
his view, a trainer should become more of a collaborator with his 
or her students as they individually construct their own meanings 
from their life experiences. Vygotsky’s theory nicely aligns with 
the current constructivist theory of learning.
Learning Using Social Media
“Social learning” is also in vogue as a term for learning via “social 
media.” Leading analysts of social media tend to use the term 
social learning in this sense. But this is a circular argument; that 
is, it assumes learning is social just because we use media that is 
called social.
We call media social when there is the potential for two or 
more people to interact online in some fashion. In other words, 
social media refers to Internet and mobile technologies that allow 
networked social interactions (because they are networked, social 
media were originally referred to as “social networking”).
In particular, social media refers to new technologies that 
allow “many to many” relationships, rather than connections that 
are dominated by one person. Social media are part of what is 
referred to as Web 2.0, but Web 2.0 is a broader term that also 
refers to other aspects of information technologies such as access 
to “cloud”-based databases and distributed content.
Social media offers great new opportunities to connect with a 
wide range of people you might otherwise never meet. For those 
who take advantage of this opportunity, how does effective and 
useful learning take place?
Since the popularization of MySpace and Facebook within 
the past decade, social media has exploded onto the learning and 
development scene. Facilitated learning has broken away from 
the classroom model and can be found in many different places 
on the Internet and mobile networks.

USING MOBILE DEVICES TO LEVERAGE SOCIAL MEDIA    241
Uses of social media for learning include retrieving informa-
tion from anywhere at any time; gathering and sharing informa-
tion by many people; networking, communicating, and interacting 
with learning applications, experts, and peers; and receiving infor-
mation and alerts based on location and local conditions—what I 
call “learning in context.”
Social Learning Is Not Dead
While traditional channels of information are in decline, social 
media is not dead. Print newspapers and magazines are rapidly 
migrating to an online format that almost always has a social com-
ponent for commenting or contributing other user-generated 
content. People want to ask questions, state opinions, and support 
or challenge the argument, and, most of all, be involved. The tra-
ditional coffee shop discussion over the morning paper has been 
upgraded to a global cacophony of information exchange.
What does this mean for a corporation? It means that people 
are going to demand in the workplace what they are experienc-
ing on the outside: efficient, effective, and participatory routes for 
learning. This is not against the corporation’s best interests.
Lombardo and Eichinger (1996) have suggested that formal 
learning is a very secondary source of workplace knowledge. Their 
70–20–10 model holds that 70 percent of learning applicable to 
the workplace is derived from practical experience, usually work-
ing with others; 20 percent is derived from just observing the exam-
ples of others; and 10 percent is derived from formal education.
According to this model, 90 percent of workplace learning is 
informal, and these days, much of that interaction is mediated 
by mobile technologies. If this figure is accurate, or even close to 
accurate, then this is where an organization should place its focus 
for optimizing training, learning, and development.
Long live social learning!

Responsive Design for Multiple 
Screen Formats
Chad Udell
If you have been following the web design community, you are 
likely very familiar with a term called “responsive web design,” 
sometimes abbreviated as RWD.
The term “responsive web design” was coined in 2010 by 
A List Apart blogger Ethan Marcotte, in his landmark post, 
“Responsive Web Design” (of course). This is both a design  
technique and a development tactic aimed at streamlining  
content production, graphic design work, and overall web devel-
opment workload.
This technique seems to have caught almost everybody in the 
e-learning industry off-guard. While we were largely concerned 
with the “When will Apple support Flash on iPad?” argument, 
someone moved the cheese. Surprise: our audience moved it. They 
decided that battles over plugins weren’t anything they needed to 
be involved in and just started using content that worked on their 
devices. This meant working on all of them. We gnashed our teeth 
and really had a hard time with it. Now that the world has seemingly 
moved on, it’s time for us in the learning industry to get over it 
and get back to creating for the audience, rather than complaining 
about their choices.

MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING

Responsive Design for Multiple Screen Formats  245
This chapter will help show you how to get started with respon-
sive design, but more importantly, why we should be thinking 
about it and why learning the underlying technologies and stan-
dards behind any toolkit will take you far.
Diving Into Responsive Design
In his article Ethan Marcotte quoted John Allsopp (2000):
The control which designers know in the print medium, and often 
desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of 
the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t 
have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility. But first, 
we must “accept the ebb and flow of things.’
The mechanics of it are deceptively simple. It really hinges 
around a CSS3 technique (commonly lumped in with HTML5), “CSS 
media queries.” These media queries look a bit like this (Pardon our  
CSS geekery here. It will be over soon, so don’t go anywhere):
@media only screen and (max-device-width: 480px) {
div#wrapper {
width: 400px;
}
div#header {
background-image: url(media-queries-phone.jpg);
height: 93px;
position: relative;
}
div#header h1 {
font-size: 140%;
}
#content {
float: none;
width: 100%;
}
#navigation {
float:none;
width: auto;
}
}

246 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
In the query depicted, devices with a maximum screen width 
of 480 pixels or less will have the styles following the declaration 
applied to the content in the browser viewport.
Pretty simple, really. The basic gist is that you create a “query” 
that, given a particular web browser’s capabilities and specifications, 

Responsive Design for Multiple Screen Formats  247
renders the relevant style information to ensure the site looks and 
*hopefully* behaves properly.
Beyond the implementation of the technique, though, there 
are some things you should consider as you assess what it means 
for us in the learning industry.
	 1.	 The development of responsive web design is evidence  
of the fact that we need to be more cognizant of standards 
and specification of the broader industry—like it or not, we 
are web designers, developers, and development operations 
people, not just instructional designers, cognitive scientists, 
and trainers. We may be more focused on organizational 
performance than we are on getting people to like us on 
Facebook or sign up for a newsletter, but that doesn’t mean 
we can’t steal their tactics to help us achieve our goals.
	 2.	 Your tools are meaningless (or at least much less meaningful 
than they were). Throw them away and learn what makes the 
web work. Web standards aren’t a new thing, and neither is 
the first draft of the SCORM standard (in fact, they nearly 
correlate chronologically in terms of acceptance), yet we 
have put up with tools that output substandard markup and 
junk for far too long in the name of a niche spec (SCORM). 
Moral of the story: Learn standards, not tools. If you must 
center around a tool, use one that outputs valid, sensible, 
standards-compliant markup and uses proper JavaScript and 
CSS in its output. Learning and understanding HTML5 is far 
more important than any specific authoring tool.
	 3.	 If a “little” wrinkle, such as not getting a plugin to be 
accepted on a new device or platform ends in a stalemate  
for an entire industry for more than two or three years, 
doesn’t that signal the fact that we have been more than just 
a bit myopic in our view of what tools offer us? I mean, the 
web design world got on just fine after Flash flamed out. 
Why has it taken more than three years for major vendors  
in this space to give us alternatives? The likely answer:  
limited resources for over-stressed development teams and 
overdependence on a tool chain that required a proprietary 
plugin from all the vendors we depend on. You would have 
thought Authorware’s demise would have taught us all a 
valuable lesson, but here it is—2014, and many of us have 
egg on our faces yet again.

248 
MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
	 4.	 Templates and starter kits are not adequate. The bottom line 
is that technology marches on. Get with the program and 
learn how technology advances, or face the consequences. 
Any vendor’s starter kits or templates are likely to be behind 
where the rest of the web industry actually is. Learn the 
underlying technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and you 
can then use whatever tool you buy later.
	 5.	 Making standards-compliant markup compatible with LMS 
and LRS is much, much easier than taking learning tools 
output and trying to make it web standards–friendly. We’ve 
been getting it backward for years. Adding SCORM function-
ality or xAPI features to basic web content is not that difficult 
to do via some online tools or even manually typing out the 
manifests and other needed files. It’s far more difficult to 
take a rapid tool’s output and make it more mobile-friendly. 
Remember: mobile first!

Responsive Design for Multiple Screen Formats  249
This missive isn’t meant to be all doom and gloom. A number 
of people in the industry are starting to get it and do the right 
thing. At Float, we have been producing multi-screen and true 
mobile learning from our very beginning. However, a few ­others 
are also contributing. Producing valuable content isn’t easy, 
regardless of what camp you fall in. In addition to private indus-
try taking note, it’s clear that the government is listening as well. 
Significant moves have been made to ensure that web properties 
are moving to responsive design. With the U.S. Departments of 
Defense, Energy, Education, and more being such huge consumers  
of training and proponents of web standards, won’t that eventually 
require our learning information to be responsive as well?
Regardless of the initial uptake and response, it’s clear that 
something has to change. No longer can we go on creating con-
tent for a proprietary or non-scalable plugin or renderer and con-
sider it future-proof.

Design Choices for Mobile 
Learning Management Systems
Gary Woodill
Computer-based learning management systems have been avail-
able since the 1960s (for example, PLATO, on mainframe com-
puters), but really took off in the late 1990s and early 2000s. With 
the speed of change that is happening in the world of education 
and training software, it is not surprising that some learning man-
agement systems are starting to look stale and worn. At the same 
time, many LMS companies recognize that their market is reach-
ing a limit of saturation and are looking for new ways to sell their 
intellectual property. Just in time, along comes the mobile learning 
revolution, presenting new opportunities for learning manage-
ment system companies to market their wares. How they have 
done that, however, varies greatly.
Some LMS companies have simply added the word “mobile” 
to their offerings without much change at all. Others have done 
cosmetic changes, redesigning their interfaces to fit on a small 
screen. A few companies have gone beyond this to have mobile 
learning management systems actually work on smart phones and 
tablets. Some have even developed stand-alone LMSs that do not 
need to be connected to a non-mobile LMS. And finally, a few 
LMS companies have dipped their toes into the waters of innova-
tion and tried to create something new.

252    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
In reviewing mobile learning management systems, I have 
identified five levels:
•• Level 0—LMSs not ready for mobile learning
•• Level I—LMSs graphically redesigned for mobile devices
•• Level II—mobile extensions (“plugins”) for existing learning 
management systems; the extension only works in conjunction 
with a non-mobile LMS
•• Level III—stand-alone, self-sufficient mobile learning manage-
ment systems
•• Level IV—innovative mobile learning management systems 
that use some of the new affordances of mobile devices, such 
as location detection or cloud computing
If we place some of the available mobile learning management 
systems on a continuum from Level I to Level IV it might look 
something like this (this is not a complete list of mobile LMSs, 
just examples).
Spectrum of Mobile Learning Management Systems
The LMS Spectrum
As you can see, a few of the open-source learning management 
systems have been designed with mobile computing in mind. For 
example, the Moodle interface consists of a three-column layout 

DESIGN CHOICES FOR MOBILE LEARNING    253
that is very mobile-friendly. Sakai, another open-source learning 
management system, has a group of developers who have pro-
duced features that make this LMS mobile-ready. But these LMSs 
are not very different in their mobile and non-mobile versions.
Another approach is to design “plugins” or “extensions” for 
existing learning management systems (Level II). Moodle has sev-
eral plugins designed for that purpose, including MLE-Moodle 
and MOMO (Mobile Moodle). Blackboard has an extension 
for their Learn 9.1 platform called Blackboard Mobile that lets 
users receive notifications of updates to their Blackboard courses, 
including new assignments, course content, study group updates, 
community discussions, and their grades/assessment results.
At Level III, there are stand-alone mobile learning systems that  
manage learning materials for users without needing to reference 
a non-mobile LMS. Examples are BlackBerry Pushcast (formerly 
Mobile Chalkboard), which runs only on the BlackBerry plat-
form and is mostly used for delivering training to users (hence 
the emphasis on “push” in the name). It features text, graphics, 
video, and audio and will handle surveys, call requests, or email 
requests. It administers tests and tracks results and content usage. 
Similarly, KMx from Knowledge Management Solutions provides 
development and delivery of e-learning courseware, knowledge 
management, and collaboration tools for mobile devices with full 
conformance to the shareable content object reference model 
(SCORM).
Another contender in this category is CellCast from OnPoint 
Digital. This mobile learning program allows users to create, 
notify, deliver, and track audio and video learning content on a 
wide variety of smart phones, tablets, and netbook computers. It 
also allows for the delivery and tracking of mobile web content, 
web and PDF files, videos, animated narrated slide presentations, 
and spoken word and text-based assessments. CellCast is fully inte-
grated with OnPoint Digital’s learning management system, but 
can operate independently without reference to any LMS.
Unfortunately, there are no mobile learning management sys-
tems that I would classify as having reached Level IV. However, 
there are signs of innovative new solutions that will transform the 
world of mobile learning management systems, and not simply 
rehash the concepts of desktop LMSs. One example is the mEKP 
mobile learning management system from Net Dimensions that 

254    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
delivers a full-featured learning management system on a USB 
stick. This allows students to go off-line, do their work, and have 
it tracked without a connection to the Internet. They simply take 
their USB stick with them and plug it into an Internet-connected 
computer at the first opportunity.
The results of their work are then uploaded to a full Net 
Dimensions enterprise learning management system. This 
approach shows that Net Dimensions is moving toward the new 
definition of mobile learning—a definition that is about the needs 
of learners on the move, not about mobile technology, per se.
Finally, eXact Learning Solutions, headquartered in Italy, has 
been experimenting with a novel wearable learning management 
system called eXact iTutor. It is described on the company website 
as “the world’s first wearable, wireless mobile learning platform.” 
It is location-based and voice/gaze controlled for workplace deliv-
ery of crisis management instructions and just-in-time training 
materials. Unfortunately, in speaking with their North American 
representatives, I learned that this mobile LMS is just a prototype, 
not yet in production. However, it is definitely a step in the right 
direction in that its design is using some of the unique possibilities 
of mobile learning that have not been available before.
Examples of mobile learning management systems of any 
kind are few and far between. Of the several hundred LMSs on 
the market, only three or four actually have any features that sup-
port mobile learning. In the next year or two, watch for many 
more mobile LMSs to come on the market, as LMS companies 
jump on the mobile bandwagon. At the same time, pay attention 
to the market leaders described above. They will have the most 
experience in this new category of learning software.

The New Route to Learning with Social 
Geospatial Data
Jim Ferolo
Portability, ubiquity, and connectivity—three affordances of 
mobile devices—have created a new learning platform that is dis-
tinct from all our other educational tools. But a fourth built-in 
feature of mobile devices—the generation of geospatial data—is 
transforming learning in ways we are just starting to imagine. In a 
2012 interview, Jeff Jonas, IBM distinguished engineer and chief 
scientist, Entity Analytics, described geospatial data as “analytic 
superfood.” “Geospatial data,” he says, “is going to rip the lid off 
what’s computable.”
The creation of geolocation data is the tagging of a specific 
place with additional information or the addition of place data 
to existing information. Here is how it works. Your phone has a 
SIM card, your personal key that lets you operate on a cellular 
network. Inside the phone there is also a wireless Wi-Fi adapter 
that allows you to connect to Wi-Fi or WLAN networks, and that 
adapter is wired into an antenna to boost the signal. Finally, there 
is a GPS chip that pulls signals from satellites. The combination of 
these pieces allows for three or four different types of geolocation 
functionality: GPS geolocation, Wi-Fi geolocation, cell tower geo-
location, and, for some phones, near field communication (NFC).

256    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Near field communication is a set of standards for mobile 
devices that allows them to establish radio communication with 
other mobile devices that are in close proximity. NFC is an exten-
sion of earlier active or passive RFID technologies in that it now 
allows for two-way communications. Passive RFID tags are unpow-
ered and can be as small as several millimeters and read at a dis-
tance of 5 meters. Powered or active RFID can be read at a longer 
range. The resolution of active RFID has proven to be trackable at 
the millimeter level in three dimensions, as well. However, while 
possible, most apps do not use this for their geolocation abilities.
Cellular geolocation triangulates the location of a mobile device 
using the cell network and can be accurate to around 2 or 3 kilome-
ters, if the device is used over a sufficiently long period of time. Wi-Fi 
geolocation uses the unique SSIDs of several routers to provide loca-
tion data and can be much more accurate. The most commonly 
known method of geolocation is public satellite–based GPS, which 
can accurately note your position within 40 meters, and often closer.
Understanding the Technology of Place
When my colleague Chad Udell proposed a new geolocation app 
called Wayfiler some time ago, he was clear that it was to be simple, 
it was to be an extension of functionality that could be found in 
some other apps, and that it was to be a tool that could be used for 
learning by individuals or by organizations. Wayfiler is an attempt 
to utilize a suite of services to provide unique geolocational mobile 
learning opportunities. The app consists of several different layers 
and is essentially a very sophisticated metadata app.
Two categories of services are within the application: the 
things that the app controls (Find Nearby) and the things that the 
user controls (Tag Now). This diagram shows the relationships 
within the app.
As a designer, I am extremely interested in the emerging 
vocabulary of the “technology of place.” I want to consider these 
systems and the ways we can create engaging experiences that 
use not only the traditional x, y, and z positions within the geom-
etry of our canvas, but also understand and use new methods for 
the visual representation of temporal and location information. 
Also, I was aware of the need to reflect actual behavioral patterns 
and possibly their magnitude as well. Yes, things are becoming 

maps 3.0    257
more complicated, and our job is to devise the simplest solu-
tion out of all of this. Simply, my job as a user experience (UX) 
designer is to author experiences that will facilitate desired 
learning outcomes.
But learning outcomes are dependent on what a person is try-
ing to learn. A variety of “learning design patterns” are available 
to me as an instructional designer, depending on what I am trying 
to teach. There are formalized structures and frameworks within 
which we can develop that allow us to quickly apply patterns and 
create amazing new experiences to augment the “thickness” or 
impact of experiential learning.
As we began to investigate current design patterns that were 
present within geolocation apps of interest to me, we quickly 
learned that there was quite a bit of new information that would 

258    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
help me understand the underpinnings of how these devices 
work. Here are some of the possibilities that were considered in 
order to start the design of Wayfiler.
Geolocation Graphics
We graphically represent magnitude and location in iconic ways. 
Some are traditional. We see timelines and sparklines, and their 
derivatives, along with quadrant graphing and geometric scaling. 
Some of these translate well to the small screen, but the use of 
component sets within the frameworks of mobile is creating a syn-
thesis of ideas when it comes to mapping, way-finding, and the 
construction of personal location-based points of view. It is clear 
we are all onto something new.
Map View
GoogleMaps came online in 2005, so we are approaching a decade 
of information and standards from that specific application. One 
of the first mashups on the web was HousingMaps.com, using a 
combination of Craigslist and GoogleMaps. At the end of the day, 
we end up dealing with two major design patterns within loca-
tion. The first is the ever-powerful map view. We see markers in 
some type of cartographic system. When you take the map away, it 
devolves into a simple list view.
List View
A list view is a text-based representation of location, for example, 
places of interest that are a specific distance filtered on a radius 
from your current position. A lot of what we can do are derivatives 
of this technique, using various filters to help us answer such ques-
tions as: Where am I? How do I get to where I want to go? How am 
I progressing?
Where Am I?
There are different ways of showing current location, as evidenced 
by three major geolocation apps: Waze, Glympse, and Tom Tom. 

maps 3.0    259
Waze is a crowdsourced routing tool based on many users making 
their locations available to others in order to pluck traffic patterns 
out of the aggregated data generated by thousands of mobile 
phones. I am a fan of the Waze application due to its statefulness 
and approach to design that is responsive to the inputs of users, 
also known as “map contributors.”
Users who drive with the app open on their phones passively 
contribute traffic and other road data to the system. They can 
also take a more active role by sharing road reports on accidents, 
police traps, or any other hazards along the way, helping to give 
other users in the area a “heads-up” about what’s to come. This is 
clearly a social application that also has an active community of 
online map editors who ensure that the data for their areas are as 
up-to-date as possible and enhance the usefulness of this way-find-
ing tool.
Glympse is a tracking tool that allows others, with your permis-
sion, to see your location on a map for a limited amount of time, 
and Tom Tom is a traditional GPS-based navigation device. All of 
them use geolocation and the same basic visual design patterns.
How Do I Get There?
The display of routing information is heavily dependent on the 
personality of the app iconography. It is important to have an 
understanding of where people are located at any given time and 
the overall “mood” of the route. Is it happy or is it sad? (That is, is 
it fast or slow?) At the same time, it is important to use algorithms 
that calculate the most efficient route in terms of speed of traffic 
or the location of barriers, not just the shortest distance.
How Am I Progressing?
Finally, we need to know how well we are getting along in our jour-
ney from point A to point B. These can be displayed as time saved 
or efficiency of travel. Essentially, the temporality of a journey is 
based on the hypothetical speed that you could traverse a route, 
given legal limitations and your mode of transport’s capabilities. 
More importantly, it can be measured in context, given the inputs 
of travelers who are directly ahead or with an aggregation of travel 
progression data. The number of deviations from a mean can help 

260    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
determine travel trends and which delays can be predicted versus 
those that are random, such as accidents.
Mapping Your Personal Narrative
All of the geolocation affordances and other capabilities of mobile 
phones make it possible to map a personal narrative using a com-
bination of these features. However, most current geolocation 
apps are very utilitarian and not designed with individualization in 
mind. But it is possible, as shown by the great work that Instagram 
has done with Photomaps. Instagram is widely known for its ability 
for users to take and filter mobile-based images in very artful ways 
and link them to users’ social networks. The app also now allows 
for integration of geolocation data of images. While in map view, 
users see virtual “stacks” of photos with a single number on top 
of the stack that indicates the number of photos for that specific 
location. The granularity of the stacks changes as users zoom in 
and out of map view. It is simple, contains powerful and illustrative 
mapping patterns, and introduces the personal through photos and 
their associated magnitudes—brilliant simplicity.
Designing and Building the App
When Chad Udell originally scoped the application, it was devel-
oped through Float’s own S3D process to ensure that a clear 
strategic approach was taken. A needs analysis was completed to 
identify a slice in the marketplace that had a very specific desire for 
such an application. The ability to locate content to help learners 
with their on-demand needs, the possibility of securing data with 
a security framework, the integration and leveraging of existing 
data types and application APIs, and a rapid development cycle 
were all taken into consideration. This led to several decisions—
to initially only develop in Apple’s iOS to limit the number of 
platform iterations that would be required by various devices, the  
integration of Dropbox as a widely accepted personal data repos-
itory, and the use of turnkey cloud-based application services that 
could easily scale given overall app usage levels. Given that the 
app is a very sophisticated metadata organizer, the database struc-
ture and build were extremely important.

maps 3.0    261
For our database, we used the MongoDB to store all the con-
tent and coordinate data for everyone. We like using Mongo for its 
scalability and built-in support for specific activities. We are using 
its current support of latitudes and longitudes and the radial sort-
ing method.
As mentioned, the app was built using the iOS operating sys-
tem and currently only runs on Apple devices. As clients use the 
app, there are interactions with various Apple and Dropbox-based 
services. Here is how it all works:
	 1.	 Core Location is the part of iOS that tells you where you are 
and uses the geolocation methods described above.
	 2.	 Standard Location Service is what uses the constant GPS 
monitoring.
	 3.	 Significant Location service is actually a computation of 
differentials.
	 4.	 Region Monitoring checks to see whether you are in a 
bounded area and is commonly referred to as “geofencing.”
	 5.	 This sensor data and positional information is then inter-
preted by MapKit, which does the related lookups of lati-
tudes and longitudes.
	 6.	 Apple Map Services then translates these generic latitudes 
and longitudes into information that means something to 
the user.
Other Supporting Technology
A number of other technologies were used in constructing our 
geolocation app. Node JavaScript provided a way to encapsu-
late the information and handle the multiple connections from 
the client. This is a very important part of creating applications 
that require simultaneous connections to a cloud-based set of 
services.
We used Core Data for iOS as the interface for the database, 
extremely important, as it relates to the primacy and immediacy 
of the data we use the most through caching. So this is the place 
where information is stored on your device and is checked first 
before queries are made to cloud services.

262    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Finally, we have Dropbox for file storage, which happens to 
be the system we used for our alpha version of the app, but could 
just as easily have been any other file server–based system that 
included its own authentication or security framework. Files are 
hosted in Dropbox and are related to the location metadata.
Use Cases for Wayfiler
The use cases for applications like Wayfiler are varied, and we 
offer the following as suggestions:
•• For technical support related to plant locations or perfor-
mance support documentation that is tied to specific pieces of 
equipment or processes
•• For the agronomic organization that wants to place seed data 
and forecasting information based on its geographical posi-
tioning, slope, or GIS data
•• For the sales or service professional who is looking for a visual 
distribution of specific services or machinery to ensure that 
routing and on-site calls are optimized and being informed by 
real-time traffic information
•• For tourist bureaus who want to produce a virtual tour of their 
downtown, showing documents, images, and videos as a per-
son visits a specific point of interest
•• For geocaching mobile learning activities where files are 
collected rather than real objects. These could be clues in a 
learning game that promoted situated learning along with the 
benefits of physical activities.
There are many features we would like to consider adding in 
subsequent releases. We are extremely interested in the concept 
of geofencing and subsequent security frameworks. We would like 
to continue working to a user flow that would release files into the 
system based on proximity. So when users move closer to a specific 
region, a new set of files could be made available. There is also the 
opportunity to do time-locking along with this to add the com-
ponent of temporal locks. Specific files would be available based 
on crossing a threshold during the day with availability opening 

maps 3.0    263
and closing with the passing of seconds, minutes, hours, days, or 
years. Additional security frameworks could be added to tie it to 
associated services through a public API. Other developers would 
have the opportunity to use the metadata structures to tie their 
software into the geolocated caches of files.

Using Push Notifications to 
Make Mobile Learning More 
Useful
Chad Udell
Let’s set the scene.
You want to keep your mobile learners updated and engaged 
in the learning experiences you have created, and you need to 
maximize the effectiveness of the training by making users aware 
of changes to content and services that you have already deployed.
Working with mobile learners is a unique proposition for 
those of us coming from a traditional instructional background. 
No longer confined by space or time, the world is their classroom. 
Tasks are performed on demand, and immediate learning is often 
required in conjunction with the performance of those tasks.
They may not be in the office for days, or even weeks, at a time. 
In today’s disconnected work environment, you can have remote or 
mobile workers who have no formal office space, per se. These work-
ers all have to be reached in a uniform way that is tough to ignore 
and requires little or no user-initiated requests. While mobile learn-
ing is often a pull operation in that learners request data or help 
they need when they need it, it can also require a push intervention 
to make sure everyone is in sync with policy or procedural changes. 
This is where one of the unique affordances of mobile learning 
really shines. The “Push Notification” function has a large number 
of uses that are of value in getting a message to a mobile learner.

266    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Think about your average day with your smart phone or tablet. 
You likely receive a variety of notifications on the device—every-
thing from software updates to calendar notifications to messages 
and emails, all of which take advantage of the device’s ability to 
notify you when there is content or information that requires your 
attention. People may trigger these notifications, but they may be 
automated system notifications as well. No matter the trigger, the 
user is looped into the message and the notification is stored in a 
message center or notifications area on the device for later review 
if the user is unable to react directly to the message as it comes in.
I personally use a number of apps that notify me about news, 
events, and other “need to know” information that didn’t come 
with my device. Weather apps alert me when an emergency warn-
ing is broadcast, sports apps tell me when one of my teams is about 
to start to play, games apps let me know it’s my turn to play the 
next round against a friend, and so on.
Without these notifications, I would have to keep checking 
the apps to see whether they required my attention. When using 
the notifications in the applications, I stay in the flow of my cur-
rent activity on the device or in real life until I feel that familiar 
vibration and distinct tone from an app letting me know I have 
news to read or a sports team player trade to check out.
These notifications are powerful tools that can be used for 
your mobile learning apps as well. Consider the types of apps you 
may be deploying for your workforce, and then contextualize 
yourself in the settings and use cases in which your learners are 
interacting with your content.
What sorts of breaking news, just-in-time changes, or other 
information might make a difference to their tasks? How can you 
improve their performance by giving them a heads-up on what’s 
going on in your company that they may not be aware of?
The possibilities could vary widely between industries and 
learning audiences, but try some of these examples on for size:
	 1.	 Organization-wide safety bulletins: Lockdowns, weather alerts, 
traffic issues, closures
	 2.	 Geolocation-based targeted bulletins or alerts: Useful tips about 
places you’re in or nearby
	 3.	 Application content updates: Pushed from an application con-
tent management system

USING PUSH NOTIFICATIONS  267
	 4.	 Product bulletins or alerts: Recalls, safety alerts, release 
information
	 5.	 Sales alerts: Major contract awarded, deadline for an RFP, 
process changes, pricing changes
	 6.	 Application updates: Bug fixes, optimizations, new features
	 7.	 Team alerts: Social network updates, goal/achievement 
messaging, assistance requests, daily tips or best practice 
reminders
	 8.	 HR reminders: Incomplete training events, overdue paper-
work or goal completion, leadership development messaging
	 9.	 Collaboration assistance: “Phone a friend” scenarios, travel or 
destination coordination
	10.	 Serious games: Scoreboard updates, leaderboards, play 
requests
These are just a few examples of how to use push notifications 
for mobile learning to get the juices flowing. Once you realize that 
mobile learning is neither a top-down, nor a bottom-up, learning 
proposition, but rather a combination of both, the sky is the limit.
Setting up notifications in your apps is easier than you may 
think. The major platforms all have good documentation on 
adding the feature to your applications. Each operating system  
is primarily focused either on local notifications (present only  
on your local device and requiring no network sync) or single- 
platform notifications (iOS or Android only, not cross-platform).
Generally, setting up push notifications with a server layer is a 
bit more difficult than a simple app deployment, requiring addi-
tional provisioning and certificates, but once you have the hang of 
it, you should be just fine.
You should be aware of a few other things when planning for 
an app with push services. You will need a server using SSL to  
broker notifications between your client apps and the content 
management system or custom web app you are using to populate 
the notifications.
Some vendors are emerging who help solve some of the 
cross-platform notification issues mentioned above. Pusher, 
Socket.io, Urban Airship, and others all have commercial ser-
vices to help you get up and running with notifications that work 
across iOS, Android, and, in some cases, other platforms as well. 

268    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Many mobile application management (MAM) and mobile device 
management (MDM) platforms also offer features related to app 
notifications. Check with your vendors to see whether this is some-
thing they support.
One thing you want to keep in mind is that you should use 
these tools sparingly. Don’t nag the user. These vital communi-
cations should never be used to “spam” your learner or advertise 
products or services. A constantly chattering application will soon 
find its notifications disabled. You should leverage these notifi-
cations to inform and educate, ultimately adding value to your 
application.

Improving Performance for  
Mobile Web and  
HTML5-Based Apps
Daniel Pfeiffer
Mobile web apps are gaining a lot of momentum as develop-
ers are discovering how powerful web technologies can be and 
how mobile web apps can benefit from HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 
What we love about using web technologies to build our apps and 
wrapping them in PhoneGap is that it reuses a lot of knowledge 
that we’ve already mastered. Years had gone into developing our 
knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and instead of tossing all 
that out the window for mobile, we’re able to refine that knowl-
edge even further. One thing we’re finding, however, is that we 
can’t build apps the same way we build websites—­obviously from a 
design standpoint, but also from a development perspective.
The Reflow
The seemingly simple way a web page is displayed is actually a 
pretty complex process: the initial display of a page triggers what 
is known as a reflow. During the reflow process, the content is 
combined with rules defined in the style sheets and the measure-
ments for the layout of the page are determined. After this process 

270    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
is complete, the actual pixel data is rendered and painted to the 
screen. Every node on a page impacts the time it takes to do a 
reflow. On a desktop browser, often the performance impact seems 
relatively unnoticeable. The user impact at a 10ms reflow time is 
rather negligible. However, reflows seem to be the cause of much 
of the performance loss on mobile devices. The same pages that 
take only 10ms to reflow on a desktop can take over 1000ms on a 
mobile device. Every single change to the document object model 
(DOM) further impacts reflow time (this is part of the reason why 
JavaScript-based animation looks so terrible on mobile devices).
Reducing the Cost of a Reflow
What does this mean for semantics (use of tags) in mobile apps? 
On the web, semantic-based HTML is critical for a website to be 
searchable by search engines like Google, as well as accessible 
to those using screen readers. HTML5 brings with it a whole 
host of new tags like <article> and <section> that help make the 
markup even more semantic and avoid the dreaded <div> soup 
that often plagued designs of any sort of complexity. However, 
we’re finding that semantics often needs to take a backseat to 
making efficient use of our HTML. For example, to generate 
a tableview-like structure, we use an unordered list. Instead of 
wrapping the content of each list item in an <a> tag, we simply 
listen for user interaction directly on the <li> node and remove 
the <a> altogether. (Truth be told, we’re finding that a lot of 
our <a> tags are extraneous.) We’ve also started applying some 
basic styling to the <html> tag to avoid wrapping the entire body 
in a <div> when our content needs a wrapper (we figured the 
<html> tag was already there, so might as well use it for some-
thing). Finally, we haven’t been using the new tags offered with 
HTML5 (like <section> or <article>) very often, simply because 
<div> is shorter.
What we’re working toward here is developing our apps 
so they spend less time in reflow. We’ve found that it is likely 
the reflow time that causes mobile web apps to “feel slow.” 
First, we need to shorten the time it takes to perform a reflow. 
We take care of this by removing extraneous tags: removing  
<a> tags when we can just listen for tap events on an <img> or 

IMPROVING PERFORMANCE FOR MOBILE  271
<li>, cutting down on <div> wrappers, and so forth. Next, we 
need to limit the number of times a reflow is required. A reflow is 
triggered whenever the DOM is changed or the dimensions of an 
element change; this could be adding/removing an element or 
text or changing the margins or font size of an element.
Reducing the Number of Reflows
The developer tools provided with the desktop version of Safari 
provide a great way to determine how changes to a page affect the 
need for a reflow/repaint. While it doesn’t give any sort of indica-
tion about how long a reflow/repaint will take on a mobile device, 
using the timeline tab in the developer tools in Safari does give a 
good indication of how many reflows will be required (because 
Mobile Safari renders pages similarly to the desktop version). 
Unfortunately, we have yet to find a suitable tool for monitoring 
Mobile Safari’s processes.
Let’s say you’re adjusting the style of a node in your 
JavaScript:
This “simple” style adjustment triggered three reflow/repaints 
of the page. On a desktop, a reflow probably takes less than 15ms, 
so it’s not a big deal. However, on a mobile device, a reflow can 
easily seem to take over 500ms, which means that three reflows 
triggered in rapid succession could easily take a mobile device 
well over a second to finish processing. To avoid this, use classes 
to modify an element’s style whenever possible. Style changes 
applied because of a change in classes only triggers one reflow. 
Alternatively, use the cssText property to affect all the styles at 
once (again, only triggering one reflow):

272    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Beyond changing the dimensions of an element, there are times 
when you may need to make a lot of changes to the DOM (perhaps 
when drastically updating a view). Unfortunately, every modification 
made to the DOM requires a reflow/repaint. The images below show 
the reflow/repaint cost of replacing the header on Float’s mobile site 
with the word “hi” wrapped in a <div>. (See images on next page.)
To avoid a significant number of reflows being triggered, we 
need a way to modify the DOM without triggering reflows. The 
way to do that is to clone a node in the DOM, make changes to  
the clone, and then swap the old node with the new node.
This will only trigger one (or maybe two) reflow/repaints, 
whereas making the changes directly on the element would have 

IMPROVING PERFORMANCE FOR MOBILE  273
triggered four or five. The same principle applies when using 
a JavaScript framework like jQuery or Zepto.js. Clone the item 
you’re modifying, make the modifications, and then swap it into 
the DOM. Here is the cost of the same modifications to the Float 
mobile site using a clone of the header. (See the following image.)
We also tested what the cost would be if we first hid the header 
(display:none), made the changes, and then made it visible again 
(display:block). A hidden element doesn’t affect the layout of the 
page, so it shouldn’t trigger a repaint/reflow, right? Well, sort of. 

274    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Below are the results of hiding the header, making the changes, 
and then making it visible again.
Seems like, while an element is hidden, Safari still recalculates 
style (although it doesn’t attempt a reflow until we set display back 
to block). This seems to be an improvement over simply making 
changes directly to the DOM, but we’re going to opt for the clone, 
modify, and swap method.
We tried using template files to help keep a project organized, 
but they are also very helpful toward performance optimization as 
well. Because the markup of a template is determined before being 
added to the DOM, it only triggers one reflow when adding an entire 
new view—making it rather inexpensive to manage a layout using 
templates. We used Safari to determine the cost of switching back 
and forth between two views from this demo from that post.
Despite the DOM of the page changing dramatically when I select 
a tweet and then click back, it only causes two reflows to occur.

IMPROVING PERFORMANCE FOR MOBILE  275
Conclusion
We see a lot of comments that the mobile web browser needs a lot 
of work before its ready to handle complicated apps, and while 
that’s true, web development skills also must be improved. The 
mobile device is simply not as lenient as a desktop device. Let’s 
not forget, these devices have a fraction of the processing power, 
memory, and bandwidth of their PC counterparts. Every aspect of 
the mobile design and development process must be reexamined 
for efficiencies and places where you can improve your skills and 
know-how in order to provide better end-products for your users.

Understanding the Experience 
API
Gary Woodill
After more than two decades of the development of learning man-
agement systems and the shareable content object reference model 
(SCORM), an interoperability standard for learning content, there 
is something new in the field of tracking online learning achieve-
ments. This is new software called the Experience API (xAPI), 
which for a period of time was also known as the Tin Can API.
One of the first applications to use the Experience API was 
Tappestry, an app launched by Float Mobile Learning at the DevLearn 
conference in 2012 (mLearnCon 2012 was its public beta release). 
In total, eleven companies had adopted the xAPI approach for their 
software by mLearnCon 2012, and by early 2014 more than seventy 
projects were using this new standard. In this chapter, I will try to 
explain xAPI in a nontechnical way and review its strengths and short-
comings. xAPI is an extension to the SCORM standard for e-learning 
courses (it’s not a replacement for SCORM), a standard maintained 
and updated over the past fifteen years by the Advanced Distributed 
Learning (ADL) group within the U.S. Department of Defense.
One of the main purposes of SCORM is to make online learn-
ing content compatible with many different learning management 
systems (LMSs). The problem with SCORM that xAPI addresses 
is that communication is mostly one-directional between learn-
ers and learning management systems. Tracking with SCORM is 

278    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
carried out from the perspective of the system doing the tracking, 
rarely from the learner’s point of view.
It is important to note that both SCORM applications and 
xAPI track “learning activities,” not learning itself. Learning takes 
place in a person’s brain (or within the networked storage facili-
ties of “extended minds”) and nervous system and does not auto-
matically result from simply participating in an activity, whatever 
the intention of the activity’s designer. That is true for all learning 
management systems and e-learning courses. We can only assume 
or infer that learning has taken place based on a person’s partici-
pation in specified learning activities or the results of specialized 
activities called assessments. But learning occurs in many differ-
ent ways, most of which are not prescribed in a formal way by an 
institution or training department and/or assessed by a learning 
management system.
We refer to this kind of learning as “informal.” Informal learning 
events can range from accidents that happen to long discussions 
over a glass of wine. Any non-institutional experience that results 
in a relatively permanent change in the behavior or understand-
ing of a person about any aspect of human existence can be viewed 
as an informal learning event.
Most informal learning is not tracked and reported. It just 
becomes part of our repertoire of knowledge and skills. But, in 
our society, organizations are generally run by managers who like 
to see reports, preferably with numbers, that describe the results 
of the activities of the organization. This data, in theory, can then 
be used to make decisions about the direction and activity level 
of the organization. Because of the desire for managerial control, 
many organizations want to track evidence of informal learning in 
addition to the data that is being collected about formal learning 
activities. This is one of the main goals of using xAPI.
Because informal learning can be so varied, there is currently 
only one efficient way to collect and track such data—the report-
ing of learning activities involving employees by learners them-
selves, by third-party observers, or by software agents connected to 
sensors. xAPI standardizes such reporting in several ways:
•• Using standard statements that follow this form: Actor, verb, 
object: “I did this”
•• Reporting outcomes after an activity has been completed

understanding the experience api    279
•• Including content description only after an activity has been 
completed
•• Using learning content stored anywhere on the Internet
•• Designing a new learning record store (LRS), a much simpler 
idea than an LMS
•• Allowing the LRS to store user-defined variables
•• Tracking new types of data, such as those based on simulations 
or games
•• Integrating real-world learning events with digital activities
•• Allowing learners to start an activity on one platform and later 
continue the same activity on another platform
•• Observing and commenting on the learning activity while it is 
taking place
•• Tracking collaborative groups and teams as well as individuals
•• Tagging or rating content for later retrieval
At first glance, it appears that xAPI does not take into account 
many of the unique affordances of mobile learning, such as the 
importance of location, orientation, time, and haptic feedback. 
But xAPI allows for levels of complexity in its statements that may 
cover this concern.
Its developers acknowledge that many aspects of learning expe-
riences can happen outside an xAPI-based system. Standardized 
and comprehensive ways to make statements about learning out-
comes are still needed. The xAPI website explains one approach 
to solving this problem:
Statements can get as complex as you’d like them to be, and that’s 
one way where the answer to a “more powerful” e-learning speci-
fication comes into play. . . . An example of a more complex state-
ment would be:
[Somebody] says that [I] [did] [this] in the context of [_____ ] 
with result [_____ ] on [date].
Of course, most LMSs do a lot more than this, launching 
courses, giving assessments, and plotting career paths for each 
employee. But from the perspective of what training managers 
want—good reliable data to use in their reports to senior manage-
ment—xAPI will provide more comprehensive reports, without 

280    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
the massive architecture and cost of most enterprise LMSs. It is 
easily used with a mobile device such as a phone or a tablet. As 
shown in Tappestry, the API can be used as specified, but can also 
be extended with additional features that are not in xAPI.
There are other issues in the development of xAPI to date, but 
to the credit of the developers, they are listed on their website as 
weaknesses to be resolved through more discussion with the learn-
ing and development community. There is a call for suggestions 
and a recognition that more work needs to be done to get this 
initiative right.

Implementing Mobile Learning 
Metrics
Chad Udell
Evaluating training effectiveness is a long-running challenge for 
our industry. How do we know what we are doing is having a real 
and lasting effect on our audience’s behavior and, in turn, improv-
ing our company’s performance?
An entire subset of the training industry is focused around 
this. Assessment tools and specialists, learning management sys-
tems, and many other products exist to make this easier or more 
effective. Vendors are doing what they can to help you determine 
whether your learners have achieved what you have set out to do. 
Common metrics used with these systems include whether the 
learners have attended class, completed courses, and achieved 
some level of mastery of the content you have designed and 
deployed for them to consume and internalize.
Does tracking all of these mean that learning has occurred? 
From a certain point of view, yes, it does. The industry bench-
mark, Kirkpatrick’s levels of evaluation of training (Kirkpatrick &  
Kirkpatrick, 2006) (currently in a redesign process) devotes the 
first two levels of evaluation to “Did they like it?” and “Did they 
learn something?” This taxonomy is certainly not accepted by 
everyone to be the end-all, be-all of training effectiveness evalu-
ation, but it definitely is widespread among its devotees. There is 
little in those first two levels to affirm success or even equate the 
training intervention with real-world performance. Just because 

282    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
they were there, they liked it, and they learned something doesn’t 
mean that they will sell more or be more productive.
Measuring Results
We are a results-driven culture. What if Levels 1 and 2 were viewed 
as being a means to an end and not a valued form of measurement 
itself? How do we move past this view of measurement to get to the 
real questions: “Are our training materials affecting behavior?” 
and, most importantly, “Are our materials affecting organizational 
performances or results?” A key will be to reexamine the delivera-
bles we are deploying to our learners and reframe their points of 
measurement to more closely align with the processes and tools in 
place to help them be successful.
With mobile being a new thing for many of us, it offers a place 
to do a “soft reset.” We don’t need to change everything, but have 
an opportunity to change the things that aren’t working for us 
now. What and how will we measure, and how will we tie to real-
world activities? Key components of mobile experiences that can 
be measured differ dramatically from traditional learning experi-
ences. We are concerned with things like measuring competency 
or grasp of subject matter in our ahead-of time-learning materials. 
Just as usage data, goal/funnel conversion, time spent on task, 
and task success rates are more important for marketing activities, 
these same sorts of activities are useful for mobile and just-in-time 
learning content.
For example, directly correlating the delivery of training to 
­specific shifts in data in the company customer relationship man-
agement (CRM) system, or other associated business process plat-
forms, is a powerful tactic to explore as you evaluate your mobile 
learning strategy. By doing so, you might uncover a few things.  
For example:
•• Do employees whose statistics have not improved need 
refresher training?
•• Do high performers access training materials while doing 
their jobs?
•• Are there ways to directly insert job aids or performance tools 
in problem spots in a particular employee’s workflow?
•• Do behavior patterns emerge between groups of learners? 
Product lines? Regions? Managers?

implementing mobile learning metrics    283
If your personnel need to update a CRM or application  
after a meeting, visit, or sales call, perhaps there is an oppor-
tunity to add fields to the support or ticketing screen that ask 
whether they used mobile help before or during a call. A fol-
low-up field could ask what content they accessed or whether it 
was helpful.
Make these fields a required entry prior to logging the meet-
ing notes and you instantly have data points to track to see whether 
your mobile learning is helping those you designed it for. Use this 
information to inform your revisions and additions, and continue 
to check in to see whether the overall evaluation of your software 
improves.
Covering Other Aspects of Learning
These are all tips for the formal learning process and content, but 
social and informal activity is also an area to explore.
When was the last time you reviewed your Salesforce Chatter 
or Yammer usage to correlate sharing with performance? Usage 
with closed sales? Are our best-performing employees active in 
Yammer or Chatter? Do they have their posts “favorited” or shared? 
The best chefs are on TV (a simplistic assumption, I know), but 
these chefs share their recipes with everyone to improve us all.  
I hope your best performers do the same.
Measuring event intervention access and assessing whether 
the spacing matches with product releases and other real-
world events is also worth exploring. Do new product rollouts 
require more accesses of just-in-time information? Are job aids 
for older products available in a format that helps salespeo-
ple or customer service reps make quick decisions and easily  
find answers?
The lifecycle of your products and services may have some 
bearing on whether your salespeople remember things about 
them. Just because something is near the end of its life or not 
the newest offering should not mean that information tools are 
unavailable to help close the deal or answer questions.
Putting This into Action
Tying training intervention delivery to results is a bit of mythical 
beast in the training world. Mobile learning doesn’t guarantee 

284    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
this, but it certainly brings us closer. This has been a point of dis-
connect previously, but it’s testable now.
Pick one of your low-hanging fruit projects and insert real 
measurement into the process. Look at mlearning as a perfor-
mance improvement tool, not a “have to have” for this test.
Because it’s new and possibly not fully replacing your other 
methods yet, view mobile as an additional means to reach your 
audience instead of the only one. It’s more content than you 
might have had before—an augmentation of sorts.
Take your learning and measurement hypotheses and do an 
A/B test. Give the new content to one group and not the other. 
Do the ones who receive the new tools do better? Make more 
sales? Move leads through their pipeline more quickly? Answer 
customer questions more quickly? These metrics shouldn’t be 
vanity metrics (non-actionable, low-value numbers), but rather 
real-world indicators based on the results.
Once you know a bit of what works and what doesn’t with this 
smaller effort, you can expand it. Pick larger projects, embed your 
content directly into the CRM, find new performance measure-
ment tools for mobile, and start measuring metrics that matter.

AND DELIVERING 
MOBILE LEARNING 
PROJECTS
PART 5

C H A P T E R  4 5
Managing a Mobile Learning 
Project Implementation
Gary Woodill and Chad Udell
What if you were tasked with leading the implementation of a 
large-scale mobile learning project? Where would you start? Do 
you have a good sense of all the steps that are required in order to 
be successful? Let’s have a look at what it takes to bring an enter-
prise-level mobile learning project in on time and on budget.
Start with Business Strategy
At the enterprise level, the implementation of a mobile learning 
project needs to be a response or solution to a specific set of busi-
ness problems. Without that, you are just riding a wave of adopting 
the newest technologies, without any real sense of what they can 
do for an organization. Don’t make the mistake of buying mobile 
equipment first, and then trying to figure out what to do with it. 
Understanding the business issues that are driving a mobile learn-
ing project is especially important when it comes to selling the 
idea to, and obtaining a budget from, senior management. This 
understanding is usually stated in the form of a vision statement 
that identifies the overall impact that mobile learning will have on 
the organization.

288    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Part of aligning a business strategy with the implementation of 
mobile learning is to identify stakeholders at all levels of the orga-
nization and gather and evaluate their requirements. Stakeholders 
can be used to develop “use cases” that help to define the needs of 
the organization and the impact of mobile learning on it.
There’s no question that the introduction of powerful new 
technologies can have an impact on any organization. Therefore, 
it is necessary to create a change management plan, articulate and 
update policies that may be impacted by the project, and review 
ethical and privacy standards that this technology might require.
Early in the project, it is important to develop a mobile learn-
ing implementation plan that is dynamic and adaptable, anticipat-
ing additional decisions and information that may come later in 
the project. The plan should include a detailed specifications doc-
ument, a preliminary budget, and a change management plan.
Decide on the Types of Mobile  
Learning Experiences
Any large-scale mobile learning project will likely include a range 
of learning experiences, so it is important that the project team 
know and evaluate the various options that they have in terms of 
types of content. Five types of content (or learning experiences) 
that are commonly used in mobile learning are listed below:
•• Content that has already been created by someone either 
inside or outside the organization that can be converted from 
other formats or accessed through various data sources
•• Content that is captured by mobile devices, often automati-
cally, that can then be stored and/or distributed for later anal-
ysis and use
•• Communications with others by voice or by text
•• Computational functions such as calculators, databases, and 
apps made possible because of the fact that most mobile 
devices are quite powerful computers
•• Contextual mobile learning content that uses the immediate 
environment to generate questions, requests for information, 
game-based learning, and/or informal learning activities

managing a mobile learning project implementation    289
Once the mix of content types has been decided, the proj-
ect plan should show how learning experiences and informa-
tion are going to be created. Will it be commercial off-the-shelf 
(COTS) content, open-source content, content converted from 
e-learning or print materials, user-generated content, content 
designed and developed in-house, custom content developed 
by a third party, or some combination of these? The answers to 
these choices should then be reflected in the project budget, 
schedule, and activities list.
Make Decisions About Which  
Technologies to Use
Once the plan for content types and sources has been finalized, it 
is finally time to look at the technology side of the implementation 
plan. With mobile, you are faced with two basic choices—either 
supplying employees with company-owned devices (“compa-
ny-liable approach”) or allowing employees to bring their own 
devices (“BYOD approach”) and use them at work. In either case, 
mobile learning software needed for carrying out the business 
of the company needs to be purchased (either off-the-shelf or 
custom-built), provisioned, and tested in order for employees to 
meet their goals.
This brings up the issue of who is going to manage the hard-
ware and software to be used in the mobile learning project. Will 
it be the information technology (IT) department? You may have 
no choice in this matter, in that all technology used in the organi-
zation may have to be cleared through IT. Alternatively, a mobile 
learning system can be managed externally through a vendor that 
provides a hosting service or storage in “the cloud.” Also, in some 
situations, a grassroots ad hoc system within a single department 
might already have been set up that is being used without any 
central control.
Whatever the management of technology situation is in 
your company, it is paramount that effective security procedures 
and policies be in place. Because mobile devices are controlled 
through carriers, and because they have built-in security features, 
it may be easier to provide security for mobile devices than it was 
for e-learning.

290    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Prepare and Present a Business Case
By this time in the project, you should have a full draft of a mobile 
learning implementation plan, having gathered information from 
all stakeholders and finalized decisions about content and tech-
nology choices. In order to obtain funding for this project, you 
will need to do a number of things:
•• Define the scope for the initial implementation: Will it be a 
pilot study, a staggered implementation, or a global rollout?
•• Select metrics and assessment methods for the project.
•• List estimates of all project costs and benefits in order to calcu-
late a rough return on investment (ROI).
•• Prepare a budget for whatever time period the project  
will run.
When ready, you will likely make a formal presentation to 
upper management, presenting the business case for mobile 
learning and obtaining budget approval.
Put Your Implementation Team in Place
In order to have a successful implementation of a mobile learn-
ing system, both the client and the vendor(s) must have strong 
project management procedures in place. While mobile learning 
project management is a relatively new field, there are already 
“best practices” that can be followed based on the experience of 
vendors and companies that have undertaken major mobile learn-
ing projects. The person in charge of day-to-day operations for 
the implementation effort should, ideally, have a background and 
training in project management, such as the Project Management 
Professional (PMP) designation from the Project Management 
Institute.
Right from the beginning, an executive steering group for the 
project must be formed to manage the entire initiative, including 
the development and guidance of the overall vision and strategy. 
This group should have an executive champion from the com-
pany’s management team and, if a vendor is involved, from the  
vendor’s management team. After that, a project management 

managing a mobile learning project implementation    291
team for day-to-day management of the implementation must be 
put into place and meet at least weekly.
Follow Project Documents and Procedures
At this stage, the project management team has to start working 
with the project documents and set up working procedures to 
ensure a successful implementation. A detailed specifications doc-
ument should be in place, along with a schedule to follow and a 
budget to track. Hardware may have to be ordered and installed, 
to be in place for later testing of content. A project communica-
tions operation must be launched, as all stakeholders have to be 
informed of the progress of the project in order to manage their 
expectations and to prepare them for changes that are coming.
The process of content design and development has to be 
tracked and managed, to keep the project on time and on bud-
get. Once content has been produced, it should be uploaded to 
the actual system that it will run on and be thoroughly tested. At 
the same time, both print and online help and documentation for 
the mobile learning system must be prepared and made available.
Expect to make changes in your implementation plan as the 
project progresses. This is especially the case if the project is 
spread over a relatively long period of time, for example, several 
months or even a year or two. Although you can set a schedule, 
be prepared to adjust it as the project progresses, something quite 
common in any technology implementation. Because of the high 
stakes involved, it is important not to pull the plug on the old 
training system until the new mobile learning system is in place 
and shown to be working properly.
Transfer the Mobile Learning System to an 
Operations Group
Once the initial mobile learning system has been set up and thor-
oughly tested, it is time to turn it over to an operations team. This 
group will have to be trained in all aspects of mobile learning 
usage, management, and operations and in the procedures for 
the specific system just put in place, in order to be able to assist 
users going forward. New policies on the use of mobile devices, 

292    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
which should have been discussed and finalized by this point, 
should be put into place. Privacy and ethical standards will have 
to be monitored and enforced as the system is used. While main-
taining ongoing operations, there must be regular evaluations 
and the collection of usage data for further analysis. Modifications 
will be made in the system as it is used and as content changes 
over time. Finally, content can become stale and technologies 
improved, making it important to keep the new mobile learning 
system up-to-date.
Planning for a full mobile learning project lifecycle is doable, 
but can be complex. Having a trained project management team 
and an experienced vendor who has done similar projects before 
can be important factors in implementing a successful mobile 
learning system in your organization.

Security in a Mobile World
Chad Udell
As mobile devices become more powerful and more widely 
used, security has become the proverbial elephant in the room. 
Everybody knows that there is an entirely new set of security issues 
that come into play, but few people are quite sure what to do 
about them. The excitement to deploy mobile content can make 
companies and organizations compromise or even overlook the 
security implications.
The convenience of mobile devices is their downside as well. A 
portable item that can have access to your work and personal infor-
mation is easy to misplace or be stolen. PIN security codes help to 
protect that information somewhat, but the only way to truly pro-
tect the information on a device is a mobile wipe. Of course, that 
task must be completed in a timely manner when needed to truly 
keep your information from falling into the wrong hands.
Custom applications for mobile devices are another problem 
area. Whether they are native code or mobile web apps, if they 
are accessing remote data, there is a risk. Researchers are finding 
that most mobile apps (over 50 percent, and nearly 90 percent of 
third-party apps) do not use secured connections for data access. 
Something as simple as requiring SSL connections can help pro-
tect important and confidential data.
Another concern as mobile devices are being more frequently 
used in the corporate world is that they add new vectors for potential 

294    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
threats. The devices are using new operating systems that don’t fit 
with most security vendors’ software offerings. Some companies,  
such as Symantec and F-Secure, have recently introduced security 
software for mobile devices, but they don’t work with the inte-
grated security systems that most IT departments already have 
in place. Some companies may be relying on their network secu-
rity gateways to provide protection for mobile devices, until users 
switch to mobile connections and bypass those methods entirely. 
This adds the risk of a mobile user accessing a compromised file 
and bringing it into the network, bypassing security controls. 
Add in the already known issues of unsecured wireless networks 
and Bluetooth vulnerabilities when mobile users are outside of 
the office, and it is easy to see why some corporate IT depart-
ments are nervous about the proliferation of mobile devices on 
their networks.
After hearing all that, it might seem like mobile security is 
nearly impossible to achieve. It is easy to become paranoid about 
vulnerabilities when you start researching security issues. The good 
news is that there are some positive points to talk about as well. 
The new mobile operating systems run apps in separate memory 
spaces that make it more difficult for potential viruses to hijack 
a device. The review process for iOS apps and the new security 
requirements for Google Play should help keep apps more trust-
worthy. The mobile device makers are taking the issue seriously as 
well. They understand that people want their devices to be secure 
and are taking steps to improve security in the future.
So what’s the answer? As with any evolving technology, use 
common sense and caution. Don’t rush into content mobile deliv-
ery. Create a standard for best practices for your mobile users 
and then distribute the information through all of your regular 
channels, such as newsletters and your intranet site. You can also 
consider procedures, such as requiring PIN codes or passcodes, 
setting up a remote wipe method, and considering data encryp-
tion. The most important step is to find a comfortable middle 
ground between security and ease of use. This doesn’t have to 
truly sacrifice security when done properly.
As mobile devices become cheaper, if your policies are too 
restrictive, users can easily buy and use their own phones or tab-
lets and circumvent all of the protection that you put into place. 
Mobile devices should be used to make tasks more convenient. 
Keep them that way, and everyone will be happy.

Education and Training for 
Mobile Development
Jim Ferolo
As an emerging media educator, I have had the opportunity and 
challenge of facilitating the teaching and training of students in 
higher education for the past ten years. The last two years have 
been spent developing a new curriculum and looking at the ways 
in which we introduce interactive theory and practice. We are faced 
with an interesting divergence and convergence of technology that 
I believe will help us form the ways in which we teach, and subse-
quently migrate students into the role of new media professionals.
No one can question the growth of mobile devices and the trend-
ing that shows it to be the most widely deployed computing device 
around the world. However, the very thing that makes the technology 
pervasive is also the thing that makes development so difficult. The 
wide array of host operating systems, service providers, protocols, 
and devices creates an environment that can be extremely daunting 
to deploy within an organization. Combining the technology hur-
dles with the limited amount of contact time that we have to teach 
a variety of development techniques provides two distinct paths that 
will allow students to get their product from the page to the screen.
I believe there is a clear demarcation in experience and 
approach for course content that splits after the second year of 
instruction. Lower-level students are typically highly skills-focused 

296    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
and working to ingest technology and history and find ways to 
process and apply the information to their specific aesthetic and 
evolving visual and technical styles. Upper-level students are often 
dealing with much higher levels of abstraction and conceptual 
work that forces them to engage in multiple associations and 
directed research.
Given this construct, I believe that mobile devices can pro-
vide clarity in the design process that is not always available in a 
less constrained environment of browser-based development. For  
example, if a student is engaged in developing an application  
for an iPhone, he or she will be limited to a specific screen size, a 
specific set of development environments, a specific set of gestural 
techniques, and many preexisting toolkits. This focus could cre-
ate an environment in which more time is spent considering the 
implications of their interaction design and its associated usability 
than worrying about whether it should be developed in any variety 
of technologies. I have spent more time debating the relevance of  
devices than I care to recall, so I will put the caveat out there 
that I am device-agnostic and am not advocating for any specific 
platform.
Conversely, at the upper level, I believe that mobile comput-
ing will force us to more clearly consider the implications of how 
we teach interaction design and whether or not we are creating 
experiences that are standards-compliant and deployable across 
multiple platforms. I believe that we have the chance to begin 
to reinforce the importance of the information that we need to 
deploy and how it has to be available on a variety of devices.
I am fortunate enough to have a very interesting gaming app 
in the pipeline with a 300-level course that focuses primarily on the 
design document process for the first eight weeks of the semester 
and the production of the application during the second eight 
weeks. In the class, we have not been talking specifically about the 
capabilities of the iPhone or any other platform, but instead are 
discussing gameplay, UI, and usability. We only rarely touch on the 
capabilities of a mobile device, but I expect this to change quite a 
bit as we roll into production and barrel toward a final build.

Integrating Mobile Learning 
with Social Media
Adam Bockler
The term “mobile social media” refers to social media used on a 
mobile device. Because of the new capabilities of smart phones 
and tablets, mobile social media is somewhat different from tradi-
tional social media, which, as Tom Standage (2013), in his book 
Writing On the Wall: Social Media the First 2,000 Years, has pointed 
out, has been around for at least two millennia. Mobile social 
media has depended on the development of smart phones in the 
late 1990s and the arrival of tablet computers starting in 2010. 
It differs from social learning on desktop computers in that it is 
available for use any time, anyplace, that is, at “the point of need.”
Because most employees bring their mobile devices to work 
every day, the use of mobile social media has greatly increased in 
the past few years. Edwin Huertas (2012), writing for Social Media 
Today, lists multiple benefits of employees using social media while 
working:
	 1.	 Social networking tools help employees remain focused on 
and aligned with corporate objectives.
	 2.	 These tools flatten the corporate hierarchy, empower indi-
vidual employees at all levels, and provide a direct path to 
decision-makers and executors.

298    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
	 3.	 Internal social networking encourages people to connect 
and communicate with each other, cross-pollinate ideas, and 
develop valuable insights.
	 4.	 The ability to communicate issues, insights, and solutions 
leads to generating new ideas.
	 5.	 News and information reach people more quickly.
	 6.	 People can share resources and information easily and 
effectively.
	 7.	 The company can more easily and effectively search for and 
consolidate employee skill sets to match specific project 
requirements.
	 8.	 Mobile devices allow employees to do all of these things and 
more, and, as a result, they expect that their organizations 
will provide efficient, effective, and collaborative routes for 
learning.
This chapter will discuss the importance of capitalizing on 
accessing social media via mobile devices at work.
The Informal Basis of Learning
The underlying and often quoted principle behind using social 
media for mobile learning is the 70–20–10 rule. Lombardo and 
Eichinger (1996) suggest that as much as 90 percent of workplace 
learning happens informally. The theory says most learning— 
70 percent—occurs as a result of practical experience, 20 percent 
comes as a result of observation, and just 10 percent happens from 
formal education and training. In other words, most of the activity 
of L&D departments goes to the least critical area for employee 
development.
Even though “social learning” is often associated with learn-
ing via social media, Jane Hart (2013), founder of the Centre for 
Learning & Performance Technologies (C4LPT), says there is a 
clear distinction between this term and learning with social media. 
She says, “Social learning is the latest buzzword in the learning 
industry, but let’s be clear from the outset—social learning is not 
a new training trend; it’s the way we have always learned from one 
another—whether it be at home with our family, at school with 
our friends, or at work with our colleagues.”

integrating mobile learning with social media    299
Informal learning expert Jay Cross (2012) agrees. “Learning is 
social,” he says. “We learn more from our co-workers, our bosses, 
our customers, our partners, and our friends than from our teachers 
and books. Improve the ease of free-flowing conversation and you 
improve the quality of learning across the 70, the 20, and the 10.”
Social learning—whether it’s associated with social media or 
not—and mobile learning are becoming inextricably linked. “I 
used to view mobile and social learning separately,” writes Julian 
Stodd (2013), a learning consultant. “Together, they can support 
a full learning journey, from context through demonstration, 
exploration and reflections, assessment and footsteps back into 
real life. We are doing them an injustice if we just use mobile to 
deliver assessments to reluctant learners on the bus and just use 
social to push out messages from corporate [communications] 
departments.”
Social Media and Learning in the Real World
You don’t need to look hard to see the uptake in using mobile 
devices to access social media. According to the Adobe 2013 
Mobile Consumer Survey (Pun, 2013), accessing social media is 
the number one mobile activity today. “People still predominantly 
use their mobile devices to gain information, including social. Of 
those surveyed, 71 percent reported using their mobile devices to 
access social media.” The use of mobile devices in general is trend-
ing upward. More than one out of every three minutes (37 percent) 
in the use of ICT is now spent beyond the PC, according to com-
Score’s U.S. Digital Future in Focus report (comScore, 2013).
Despite the number of people who are using social media, 
few organizations are adopting these technologies for learning. 
Jane Bozarth (2011) wrote in the eLearning Guild’s Social Media 
for Learning report that, “as of July 2011, a little less than one-third 
of organizations are currently using social media tools for learn-
ing, with a stunning 83 percent of respondents feeling that social 
media for learning has value. Most respondents indicate feeling 
supported and encouraged to make use of social media for learn-
ing.” The data also show that organizations intend to do more 
with social media for learning.
A key foundation of the deployment of social media for mobile 
learning is crafting a policy on its use within an organization’s 

300    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
overall mobile policy. However, many organizations lack policy 
in this area, a barrier to the adoption of social media for mobile 
learning in large enterprises. According to the Society for Human 
Resource Management, only about 40 percent of organizations 
have a formal social media policy. What’s more, 43 percent of 
respondents to its 2011 survey “reported that their organizations 
block access to social media sites on company-owned computers 
and hand-held electronic devices. The survey found that larger 
organizations (more than five hundred employees) are more 
likely to block access to social media sites and to track employee 
use.” Ford Motor Company (2014) has one of the best-known pol-
icies, expressed on one page, with five brief principles highlighted 
at its center:
	 1.	 Honesty about who you are
	 2.	 Clarity that your opinions are your own
	 3.	 Respect and humility in all communication
	 4.	 Good judgment in sharing only public information—including 
financial data
	 5.	 Awareness that what you say is permanent
Putting It into Practice
The media theorist Marshall McLuhan (McLuhan & Fiore, 
1967) foresaw the implications of digital computing in the 1960s. 
“Education must shift from instruction, from imposing of stencils, 
to discovery—to probing and exploration and to the recognition 
of the language of forms,” he said. Social media follows in line 
with that thinking by allowing people to take control of what they 
want to learn at any time of the day, and from any location with 
mobile phone or Wi-Fi service. Here are some other ways that 
employees can use social media for mobile learning:
•• Using social media for mobile learning helps curate informa-
tion within a personal learning network or a community of 
practice. It does this in two ways: by allowing employees to be 
in touch with each other and in touch with employees in simi-
lar roles in other companies.

•• Employees within the same company can share information 
within minutes. Jane Bozarth wrote for Learning Solutions 
about how an individual from one company shared a confer-
ence recap with his colleagues:
•• “Users, armed with phones equipped with video cameras, 
are increasingly comfortable with and adept at creating and 
sharing their own videos. Encourage them to be ‘social’ 
in the sense of contributing to course materials and orga-
nizational communication. When . . . Craig Taylor was the 
company’s sole employee sent to Las Vegas for DevLearn, 
he ended each day by capturing about five minutes’ worth 
of reflection about the experience: speakers he’d seen, an 
overview of key points, a few critical takeaways. In this way, 
he was able to document his day, reflect on new learning, 
and share it with those back at the office.”
•• Employees working for different companies but in similar 
roles can exchange ideas through social media in a variety of 
ways. They can engage in Twitter chats, for example, using a 
common hashtag. LinkedIn has discussion groups on differ-
ent topics that workers can browse throughout the day, par-
ticipating in the group discussions that appeal to them. Both 
methods have the potential for employees to expand their 
networks, ask questions, as well as be seen as an expert by pro-
viding answers.
•• The combination of social media and mobile devices can give 
employees an idea of the whereabouts of a colleague. With 
many employees working from the road, social check-ins on 
enterprise social networks (and even on public ones) let col-
leagues know when someone may not be at his or her desk.
Columnist Clive Thompson (2013) writes about this last idea 
in his book, Smarter Than You Think (2013). He references the 
term “proprioception,” which is the body’s awareness of where its 
limbs are located, as a metaphor for our potential awareness of the 
status of our colleagues. Thompson relates this to the workplace: 
“When groups of people—friends, family, workmates—keep in 
lightweight online contact, it gives us social proprioception: a 
group’s sense of self. Used correctly, social proprioception can 
make one’s work life less frazzled by reducing the constant stream 

302    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
of interruptions. A group that’s connected in an ambient fash-
ion can—counterintuitively—spend less time on communication, 
particularly the writing and reading of endless email.”
At the same time, the use of social media in the workplace 
has resulted in a major increase in the amount of information 
to which we need to pay attention. Social media and networks 
that feature the ability to organize and store information for 
later retrieval can be valuable tools for the enterprise in order 
to prevent the loss of institutional knowledge through employee 
attrition, changes in careers, and retirement. For instance, the 
National Archive and Retired Federal Employees Association cal-
culates that 10,000 years’ worth of American federal worker expe-
rience is lost every day, or forty-six days every second, according 
to The Washington Post. Enterprise social networks such as Jive, 
Yammer, and Tappestry all provide the ability to store and catego-
rize information in their own ways if they are part of your overall 
strategy for preserving this knowledge.
Leveraging the Effects
In this era of “big data,” the huge amount of information that 
social media generates can be used for all kinds of purposes. For 
example, Harris Interactive, a U.K.-based market research firm, 
revealed in 2011 (Bain, 2011) that they were “using GPS data from 
mobile phones to track respondents’ whereabouts” because of 
GPS’s ability to “observe behavioral patterns, look at how people 
use the mobile web when they’re out and about, and send rele-
vant surveys to participants based on their location.” The service 
had tracked more than twenty million Facebook posts from twenty 
thousand participants in the United States.
Beyond location data, other social signals can now be measured 
in conversation, thanks to MIT professor Alex (Sandy) Pentland’s 
(2008) “sociometer” device. “Using just this data, with no knowl-
edge of what was said, Pentland could predict the outcome—
whether a job offer, a second date, or investment in a business 
plan—more accurately than by using any other single factor.” In 
his book, Honest Signals (2008), Pentland suggests that by “read-
ing” our social networks with these devices, “we can become more 
successful at pitching an idea, getting a job, or closing a deal.”

integrating mobile learning with social media    303
The use of social media for mobile learning is burgeoning in 
many different industries. For example, in finance and insurance 
firms, employees can quickly gather information, such as the latest 
stock or housing prices, when they need it in order to compete. 
Food producers and other agricultural professionals, who have up 
until recently worked in relative isolation, can now connect with 
others to share techniques and experiences, even when they’re 
in the field. Retailers can train employees with mobile devices at 
the checkout lane or the customer service desk, and employees 
can refer to the devices when they need immediate performance 
support, even while interacting with customers.
The world of work is beginning to embrace the use of social 
media for mobile learning. To begin, develop your goals for using 
social media. Then find a network that works for you based on 
those goals, whether it’s available publicly (like Twitter) or pri-
vately (choose an enterprise social network or an internal wiki). 
Next, find what others are talking about and contribute by answer-
ing questions or asking your own. Finally, keep evaluating to see 
whether you have to make adjustments to your social media strat-
egy, whether it’s for you as an individual or as a company.
No matter how you use social media for mobile learning, 
you’re bound to make some discoveries.

Budgeting for Social 
and Mobile Learning
Gary Woodill
Organizations face a choice in provisioning mobile devices for 
their employees. One choice is to have the corporation buy com-
patible devices for its workers and managers (often referred to as 
a “corporate-liable” solution). Another option is to allow employ-
ees to bring their own devices to work and use them for both work 
and personal uses, with the company supporting software that is 
important to its operation (also known as “bring your own device” 
or BYOD). A third option is to have employees supply both their 
own devices and any productivity software that is needed to do 
their work (known as “bring your own technology” or BYOT). 
Many companies use a combination of these approaches, depend-
ing on the position and work of an employee.
Don’t overlook the costs of publishing mobile content that 
meets the needs of your company. While employees can choose 
and pay for apps in the BYOT model, for both corporate-liable and 
BYOD models, the company needs to invest in the software it wants 
its employees to use. Some of this content will be company-specific 
materials that can’t just be bought off-the-shelf, so budgeting must 
include all costs for in-house planning, writing, graphics, editing, 
programming, testing, and maintenance (Udell, 2012). These costs 
can be higher for the BYOD model, because of the need to develop 
content for multiple platforms and screen sizes.

306    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
Finally, ongoing procedures will have different costs, depend-
ing on which deployment model you choose. If you are using a 
corporate-liable model, then the costs of maintaining and updat-
ing software will be the corporation’s. If it is a BYOT model, then 
all the costs will be borne by employees. The BYOD model will 
have a mix of procedures and maintenance costs, depending on 
what software is being used.
BYOD represents both opportunities and problems for the 
employer. Employee-owned devices are often being utilized 
because the employees prefer them; they are convenient and help 
employees perform their daily routines in a comfortable and effi-
cient manner. As they are the property of the employee, they can 
free the employer from having to negotiate and maintain mobile 
contracts. They are also alien to the workplace; they are not being 
introduced by a company decision, they are not standardized, and 
they may not be supported (or even condoned) by company pol-
icy or infrastructure. Despite this, they are interacting in various 
degrees with company information technology resources.
Many tout BYOD as unstoppable (MacLeod, 2012). In many 
cases, it is a powerful, work-enabling tool that is being pushed by 
employees, sometimes without any explicit company policy to do 
so. Trying to eliminate these devices may not be effective and could 
result in employees circumventing policy in droves; for some exec-
utives, this can be a frightening scenario (Kaneshige, 2012a).
If a company decides to support a BYOD policy, some of the 
traditional mechanisms of the company must change to account for 
the new technology, and some of the following questions are raised:
•• How does IT handle access, security, and support?
•• How does the executive decide on policy?
•• As the device is used with company assets, who owns what?
•• How does finance decide the costs in terms of allocated bud-
geting and employee reimbursement?
•• What is the impact on overtime compensation if employees 
continue to do work for the company after hours?
Given the many variables involved in using a BYOD approach, 
this complex set of issues requires careful analysis for its impact on 
a company’s budget.

budgeting for social and mobile learning    307
A 2012 survey of business and learning professionals found 
three major issues identified as impediments to mobile learning 
(ASTD and the Institute for Corporate Productivity, in Sosbe, 
2012):
	 1.	 Security concerns: 36 percent
	 2.	 Integration with company assets: 37 percent
	 3.	 Budgetary concerns: 46 percent
Despite all the noise in the literature regarding the first two 
issues, budgeting is the dominant issue for mobile learning.
To be effective in both social learning and mobile learning 
endeavors, an organization has to take an active role to promote, 
develop, police, and nurture the growth of a learning community 
that operates within the corporate cultural framework. This will 
demand planning, pilot programs, change management, imple-
mentation, and maintenance. As the existing IT infrastructure will 
account for most of the technology demands, the major budget-
ary concerns involve people to manage and support this initiative.
As indicated above, an organization can choose three basic 
approaches to deploying mobile:
	 1.	 Corporate-Liable: The organization selects, purchases, and sup-
plies devices (with the software) to their employees.
	 2.	 BYOD: The organization supports employee-owned mobile 
devices and supplies software when necessary.
	 3.	 BYOT: The organization allows access to its systems  
through employee-owned devices. Software choice is left to 
the discretion, and responsibility, of the employee.
On first glance, it may seem that adopting corporate-liable 
devices is the most expensive route. Be careful! There are costs to 
deploying any new system within a corporation, and some of these 
costs are not immediately apparent.
Corporate-liable devices have some costs that are obviously 
higher than those of the alternative deployment strategies, namely 
hardware, software, and training. Obsolescence will also become 
a notable budgetary factor, as these devices are rapidly evolving 
and will probably need replacement long before they cease to 

308    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
function. This is not all downside. This approach does have cost 
advantages that come from the ability to negotiate bulk purchase 
discounts (particularly wireless fees), reduced employee expense 
reports that limit accounting costs, and reduced strain on IT due 
to standardized technology. Security and interoperability are also 
very strong with this strategy. This can reduce cost implications 
stemming from data security risks or business inefficiencies.
As an alternative, a company can choose to rely on the 
high-quality consumer devices that are already available, in most 
cases, through the employees. Ironically, BYOD can actually be 
rather expensive, more so than corporate-liable devices, despite 
the fact that the employees supply the hardware (Kaneshige, 
2012a; Kaneshige, 2012b; MacLeod, 2012).
Understand that mobile devices are dependent on wireless 
service charges and that BYOD will alter these costs in three ways:
	 1.	 Compensating the employees for those portions of their bills 
that were accrued to the company’s benefit. This is often 
handled through a stipend, but some additional charges may 
occur if the device is under heavy use or incurs justifiable 
roaming charges.
	 2.	 Handling additional expense reports.
	 3.	 Loss of negotiating power for bulk service provision.
Understand that IT will have to handle an additional work-
load to support these devices, especially because they will not be 
uniform brands or versions. This includes logging the devices 
into their systems, enabling access to company data, designing 
and implementing an appropriate security framework, providing 
support for devices and applications, and possibly developing new 
applications for a multiplatform mobile environment. Should IT 
fail to support these devices, a third party may have to become 
involved, and involving third parties to resolve mobile device 
issues may introduce an unacceptable element of risk and a major 
additional expense.
BYOT is the default strategy for many companies that fail 
to build a sound mobile device strategy and supporting policy. 
Employees start by using a myriad of mobile devices and software 
to access corporate assets. A company may actually choose this 

budgeting for social and mobile learning    309
route because the cost advantages are clear, but serious disad-
vantages are also present. BYOT has all of the budgetary issues 
that are common to BYOD, but they tend to become magnified. 
Security and interoperability can become serious problems, with 
ballooning costs. Most importantly, BYOT introduces an element 
of chaos into your IT and accounting framework.
Mobile devices are a new workplace reality. They are going to 
be present in your company, and employees will be performing 
work-related tasks on them, regardless of management decisions. 
This means that your company has no choice but to try and gain 
some level of control over their use—or surrender to chaos. As 
BYOD is already a reality in virtually every company, a policy, sup-
port system, and budget must be put in place very quickly.

Keeping Up with New 
Developments in Mobile Learning
Gary Woodill
In the MIT Technology Review, Michael DeGusta (2012) asked, “Are 
smart phones spreading faster than any technology in human his-
tory?” and answered, “Yes!” The article added, “mobile computers 
are on track to saturate markets in the U.S. and the developing world 
in record time.” For learning and development professionals inter-
ested in mobile learning, one important question is how to keep 
up with technological changes, without being paralyzed with fear of 
information overload or getting out too far ahead of others in your 
organization because of euphoria over the latest gadget.
This concluding chapter outlines my techniques for coping 
with technological change in the mobile learning field. Using 
these techniques and sources, I have been able to build compre-
hensive “environmental scans” in such diverse verticals as health, 
pharmaceuticals, and agriculture. I also am able to predict the 
near future of mobile learning, based on the simple fact that every 
field of technology is based on a set of developmental curves for 
each new innovation. But the early stages of an emerging technol-
ogy are often hidden, unless you really dig for them. This insight 
is the basis of the growing field of “predictive analytics.”
Table 50.1 describes a dozen techniques that I use to keep up 
with developments in the field of mobile learning and to under-
stand what is likely coming next.

Look for the Ripple Effects of Mobile  
Learning Technologies
Innovative technologies such as mobile computing can have a 
significant impact on existing business models, not just for the 
technology being replaced, but for all associated and dependent 
industries. For example, consider the impact of digital sound files 
on the music industry. The accessibility of high-quality, inexpen-
sive (sometimes free) music files played on mobile devices such as 
iPods and MP3 players has largely displaced the formerly highly 
profitable compact disks. This has disrupted the business model 
of not only music publishers, but the artists, music distributors, 
CD manufacturers, and graphic album designers, to name a few. 

314    MASTERING MOBILE LEARNING
As a second example, consider the impact of digital photogra-
phy. Traditional film giants like Kodak and Polaroid were late in 
responding to digital files; many film development companies 
went out of business, and camera manufacturers like Nikon are 
now forced to compete with smart phones in the camera market!
This means that a late understanding of the ramifications of 
innovative technology not only results in a potential loss of com-
petitive opportunities, but it can also mean that an organization’s 
business model can be destroyed by an “innovative disruption” 
(Christensen, 1997). An innovative disruption is a product or ser-
vice that effectively replaces not only the previous product or ser-
vice, but the value chain that supports it. This was the case with 
the arrival of digital sound files and digital cameras. It is also the 
case that the developing mobile learning industry is disrupting 
the twenty-year-old e-learning industry.
Mobile learning shares many “affordances” of e-learning and, 
to that extent, developers have simply ported over models that 
seemed to be successful for desktop learning. But mobile learning 
has many unique possibilities that could not be carried out previ-
ously. Examples include:
•• Learning while on the move or from any location
•• Using location and surrounding environment as contextual 
variables in instructional design
•• Learning at the time of need because your mobile device is 
always with you
•• Collecting and sending out data while using your mobile 
device as a research tool
•• Augmenting what a mobile camera is viewing with overlays of 
text or virtual objects
•• Use of haptic technologies to recognize gestures and touch
These are only a few of the disruptive possibilities of mobile 
learning that will change the way traditional learning and devel-
opment is carried out. Disruption does not mean that opportunity 
has been extinguished. New companies are starting up that cap-
italize on the new technologies by using novel value chains that 
work with the disruptive technology, not against it. Apple’s success 
with iTunes and the iPod is one example. Digital photo-sharing 
companies like Instagram are another.

keeping up with new developments in mobile learning    315
Tracking technological changes can alert an organization well 
in advance of potential innovative disruptions. This early warn-
ing information can be employed to evaluate the current business 
model and allow a company to consider options for change, such 
as developing a plan for business model innovation to comple-
ment the new technology (Osterwalder, 2008). Being prepared 
can help insulate the company from disruption; it may also allow 
the company to outcompete less well-prepared rivals.
In preparing for the new world of mobile learning, it is helpful 
to have partners who already know the landscape and have the 
skills and experience to anticipate and work through the unique 
issues that arise within your organization. We hope this compi-
lation of tips and techniques for mastering mobile learning will 
help to move your projects to successful completion.
