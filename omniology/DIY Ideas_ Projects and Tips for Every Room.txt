Real-Life Rooms
Old and familiar blend with the 
new and the now in this sweet 1939 
cot age—for instance, Grandmother’s milk-
glass compotes poised atop a stack of gridded 
IKEA bookcases. Or the sweet paired with the 
strong—a pink ﬂ oral wallpaper backdrop for a 
Saarinen-inspired Tulip table. It’s a look held 
together by a palet e of blue, yellow, pink, cream, 
and black, and by ample use of furnishings 
chosen for their clean forms.
 
But none of these items cost a mint. Some 
are family treasures, while others were found at 
thrif  stores, home centers, and the occasional 
roadside garbage pile. Simple stitched projects—
pillows, ot oman slipcovers, and drapes—show 
how easy it is to personalize a purchased item 
into one-of-a-kind. There’s great satisfaction 
in doing something yourself, even if it is done a 
lit le less than perfect.  
 
 
 
Before decorating began in this 930-square-
foot nest, the owner focused on the colors and 
ﬁ nishes for the walls, ﬂ oors, and windows, 
camping out in the basement until the walls and 
ceilings were painted or papered and the ﬂ oors 
reﬁ nished. For the living room’s color palet e, 
sof  restful colors were chosen—a neutral but 
elegant gray for the walls and a sky blue for the 
ceiling. To ground the room, window sashes 
were painted a sharp gray and the wood ﬂ oors 
deepened to a rich, dark walnut hue.
 
Though it’s always helpful to paint and stain 
sample boards to see how colors may look in 
a room before commit ing to labor-intensive 
painting, mistakes sometimes happen. But 
when your greatest cost is a gallon of paint, 
it’s a comfort to know the only thing you’ll be 
out is a lit le time, a few dollars, and maybe a 
sore back.

Easy art Create striped art from rolls of electrical and painter’s tape wrapped around a board, opposite. 
Tip: Cut strips longer than your board—electrical tape shrinks. Mix it up To freshen vintage style, mix bold, 
buoyant patterns in bright colors. Castoffs and affordable big-box items can be personalized to great effect: 
An $18 canvas drop cloth was the raw material for one of the armchair slipcovers, above.

RETREAT
                        Turn an unfinished basement into a durable,
                                  comfortable recreation retreat the whole family will enjoy.
rugged
Rather than ﬁ ghting a basement’s 
rugged nature, use it to your 
advantage to create a space that lets the 
family know it’s OK to relax and have fun.
 
Start underfoot. Concrete ﬂ oors are diﬃ  cult 
to damage and easy to clean, perfect for a 
space used by children. Up the style quotient 
by treating the ﬂ oors with an etching stain 
normally used for patios and garage ﬂ oors (see 
how-to on page 179). 
 
Cool gray ﬂ oors and neutral walls create 
a clean slate for bold-color accents. Inspired 
by family-favorite hobbies, such as music and 
sports, this basement is brightened by high-
energy reds, oranges, and blues.
 
To avoid the closed-in feeling all too common 
in basements, the spaces in this family room 
ﬂ ow into each other. Instead of a bunch of small 
rooms, this basement is subtly divided into 
distinct zones for watching TV, playing games, 
and making snacks.
 
To divide an open space, use diﬀ erent ﬂ ooring 
to anchor each area. An island of carpet tiles 
under the game table is perfect for durability. If 
you spill on a square, pick it up, wash it oﬀ , and 
put it back. A cushy area rug in the TV “room” 
provides sof ness.
 
A DIY brick wall is another option for set ing 
a space apart while upping the basement’s 
industrial look. The homeowners applied 
thin brick veneers to the wall via a metal grid 
system, a method that’s less like bricklaying and 
more like tiling.
 
The perfect ﬁ nish to a family basement is 
a kitchenet e. When a full-service one isn’t 
possible due to space or budget, turn a small 
nook into a wet bar using a compact fridge and a 
small sink set in a home-store vanity.
Play it again Save a vintage stereo cabinet by giving it new life as a console or buffet, opposite. The warm 
wood tones help balance the space’s more industrial feel. Lyrical pursuit Create a cheery, self-made art 
collection using favorite song lyrics, above. Typeset the words against colors that fit the decor.

DIY Ideas

What they did...
A corner becomes a cozy gaming and TV-watching space, above. Define the 
zone with carpeting or a rug, which will cut down noise. This family saved 
money on an area rug by shopping the clearance sections at furniture stores 
and flooring galleries and having a carpet installer bind the edges. Metal 
sawhorses become damage-proof ottomans when topped with cushions 
made of indoor-outdoor fabric. Another industrial-chic option: Cut a piece of 
medium-density fiberboard (MDF) to fit the top of a galvanized tub and cover 
with bold paint. Add a pillow.

Real-Life Rooms
Pillow talk
Swapping out accents is the easiest way to remake 
a space. DIY pillows are an inexpensive option.
Shop around The fabrics store does not have a 
corner on the textile market. Thrift, home center, 
and hardware stores can hold great ﬁ nds if you 
know where to look. Think clearance duvets, 
vintage shower curtains, and drop cloths, which 
were used for these durable pillows, left.
Word play Dress up plain pillows with letters 
or images cut from fabric scraps, below. These 
texting terms were stitched on before the pillows 
were sewn; you can use iron-on transfer paper to 
add designs to purchased pillows.
Defined style
For easy artwork, enlarge and 
photocopy words from a 
copyright-free dictionary, above. 
Pick words that relate to your 
family’s hobbies.

Outside in
For a bit of whimsy, turn an interior door 
into a ‘50s-style apartment door, 
complete with peephole, metal 
apartment numbers, and “windows,” 
above. (The windows are glass 
rectangles painted white on one side 
and mounted to the door’s exterior.)
Furniture CPR

coat of black paint serves as game-night

were $10 each, leaving money to 
reupholster them.

COMFORTS
                    Get the lowdown on how these simple projects can make 
   the basement a livable extension of your home.
colorful
A heavy dose of DIY details adds a 
personal touch to this belowground 
living space. Bright colors create an airy, 
nonbasement feel. And smartly chosen 
furniture pieces expand the room’s possibilities.
 
A cool archway welcomes guests to the 
basement space. The architectural element 
looks like a designer touch but is actually a 
homemade solution to a structural problem. A 
low pipe ran directly over the entryway; rather 
than relocating the door, a lowered archway 
constructed from ﬂ exible ¼-inch wood hides it.
 
Chic ﬂ oors in kicky colors are an important 
upgrade in this basement. Inexpensive ﬂ oating 
ﬂ oor products make installation a snap, even 
for a novice DIYer. The lock-in-place ﬂ ooring 
doesn’t require a wood subﬂ oor over the 
basement slab or an adhesive. In the TV area, 
linoleum planks and tiles create a fun pat ern 
(see how-to on page 182). The bar area features 
cork-look vinyl, which comes on a roll. It is cut 
to ﬁ t the space (using a newspaper template 
helps with precise measuring) and, af er it is 
allowed to expand, baseboard is installed to hide 
any imperfections from trimming for ﬁ t.
 
Other custom details include a stair rail 
made from cable, plain wood posts, and a 
handrail. Metal brackets support glass shelves 
cut to ﬁ t in the bar; the total cost for all nine 
was just $70. Modular benches provide ﬂ exible 
seating and space-savvy storage.
 
Painted in a trio of bold colors and topped 
with striped cushions, the modular units also 
add personality to the room. Other bright ideas 
for livening the space include plastic discs hung 
from ﬁ shing line to dress up the windows, fabric 
let ers to customize fun pillows, and duotone 
photos used as artwork.
Pillow flair Add a personal touch to any room with custom pillows, opposite. To get this look, fuse fabric 
letters and shapes onto fabric blocks, and stitch them onto removable pillow covers. Shapely shades To 
upgrade track pendants, cut shades from blackout fabric, fuse them to decorative fabric, and attach them to 
an adhesive-back shade liner, above. Wrap the liner around two metal rings and secure it with yarn stitches.

What they did...
If you hate the idea of having a TV as the focal point in a room, consider 
wall-to-wall sliding panels that hide the set when it’s not in use, left. The 
six sheer panels are attached to three window-treatment tracks on the 
ceiling. Painting the wall behind the television deep red makes it recede, 
visually expanding the room.

Real-Life Rooms
Expand boundaries
Basements are a special design challenge. They 
are often small or oddly shaped, plus they usually 
need to serve many functions. Here’s how to make 
your below-grade space more ﬂ exible.
Go modular In this family room, benches on 
wheels can be easily moved to where they are 
needed most. The basic boxes are a simple 
DIY project (turn to page 251). If furniture 
construction is outside your skill set, screw heavy-
duty casters to the bottom of purchased pieces. 
For particularly long or wide units, add casters in 
the middle for added support.
Streamline the design When building or buying 
furniture, go for streamlined designs. Sofas, 
benches, and tables with straight sides oﬀ er more 
arrangement options; they can sit ﬂ ush side by 
side, back to back, or against a wall.
Make it multitask Make the most of a room 
with furniture that serves multiple purposes. In 
this room, the modular benches and end tables 
oﬀ er storage space for hiding toys and books, 
below. Also consider investing in a table with 
leaves so it can grow when needed, a sofa bed 
that can provide extra sleeping space, an ottoman 
or coﬀ ee table with hidden storage capacity, and 
track lighting that can be adjusted when electrical 
outlets aren’t where needed.
On a roll
Space-savvy modular storage benches 
don’t hog floor space. The units —
topped with cushions—give guests a 
spot to sit on game night, above.

DIY Ideas

Screen stars
For the TV-hiding panels, print large 
letters and numbers and then draw the 
shapes onto fusible webbing. Apply to 
the fabric, then cut out the shapes and 
iron onto the panels. Whipstitching 
further secures the shapes, above.
Art idea
Convert digital flower images to 
duotone on the computer and then 
have a developing center print them 
onto rigid styrene board for no-frame-
needed artwork, above left.
Stone path
The runway of tumbled stone behind 
the sink is a table runner, below left. 
Draw lines on the wall where the runner 
will hang. Use adhesive to attach the 
runner, holding it in place for a few 
minutes while the adhesive sets.

look laminate panel f rom 
a closet door slider.

Triple threat A storage ottoman offers a place to rest 
your feet, adds extra seating for a full house, and provides 
an under-cover spot for stashing throws, movies, remotes, 
and more.
Kid-size storage Placing movies and a media player at a 
low level enables kids to help themselves and easily put items 
away. Storage cubbies keep toys and art supplies at hand in a 
family space that doubles as a playroom.
Boxed in Pair a wall-mounted television with a storage-
savvy credenza. Stack a variety of wooden boxes inside an 
open cabinet and fill the spaces with bins for concealed 
storage. See a similar project on page 197.

STORAGE 
IDEAS FOR
how to create
a cozy family room
It’s easier to kick back and relax when your 
family room is well organized.
1. Clean house  The ﬁ rst step to declut ering your living 
space is to get rid of or relocate anything you don’t use 
or that doesn’t belong in a public space. 
2. Every square inch Take full advantage of all the open 
space your family room oﬀ ers. Hang a ledge above a 
window, install display boxes on a sliver of wall next 
to a door, or place a narrow console table in a walkway 
behind the sofa. 
3. Twice as nice Purchase furniture that does double-
duty by providing hidden storage, such as a lidded 
ot oman or footstool. Or convert existing pieces with 
a simple makeover. Add a skirt around a table to hide 
storage boxes.

By the book Custom built-ins flank a window and offer 
both display and storage opportunities. Let pretty books 
function as artwork on open shelves, and use baskets to keep 
things looking tidy.
Under cover Don’t waste a square inch of space. 
Maximize a small window nook with a storage bench that’s 
hidden behind a fabric skirt. Wall shelves and magazine racks 
keep the nook organized.
Fireside chat For a modern take on fireside bookshelves, 
create an integrated design with a chunky mantel extended 
across one wall. Add a matching shelf above and use the 
open space below for taller items.
Good look A full wall of stock cabinets creates ample 
storage and, when finished with trim and painted, looks like a 
built-in focal point. Glass doors on top put special collections 
on display.

MAKEOVER
                           Several gallons of paint, some clever reuse ideas, and a few 
     weekends fashioned this vintage kitchen into one colorful dish.
budget
Almost everything about this 1920s 
farmhouse kitchen was charming— 
from the construction details to its eﬃ  cient 
footprint. But time had been unkind: Thick 
layers of paint kept cupboard doors from closing 
and ﬁ lled in the original tin ceiling’s relief 
pat ern. Like many old kitchen rehabs, this one 
started with a lot of undecorating.
 
The tin ceiling was stripped and refreshed 
with a sunny gold color. Cupboards can add a 
lot of expense to a kitchen remake, so these—
which were in otherwise good condition—were 
stripped and repainted a watery blue on the 
doors and dove gray on the frames. Glued-
on linoleum ﬂ ooring was removed, revealing 
original dark oak ﬂ oors. Because they weren’t in 
good shape, painting them a ﬁ eld of white and 
gold was a no-guilt decision. The hues balance 
the pop of color on the ceiling. A circular braided 
rug breaks the room’s boxiness and ups its 
energy level. Old linoleum that was glued to the 
wall behind the oven was replaced with a classic 
subway tile backsplash. 
 
But wood tones weren’t banished. For spots 
of warmth (and a visual link to oak moldings 
elsewhere in the house), the couple tempered the 
bright shades with an oak table—sliced in half to 
ﬁ t the small space—and a wide oak ﬁ le cabinet 
to the right of the oven, which adds a fun storage 
element to the room. Deep drawers can hold 
everything from linens to small appliances. Eco-
friendly bamboo countertops contribute more 
golden tones.
 
Sleek new stainless-steel appliances bring 
the kitchen fully into this century. A mosaic tile 
backsplash elsewhere ties together the kitchen’s 
blue, ivory, gray, and brown color palet e for a 
look that feels right at home.
Take it away Once layers of paint, linoleum, and shelf paper were removed, the kitchen’s character could 
be appreciated, opposite. A palette of brights is mood-lifting. Salvage sense After reusing and restoring 
what they could, the couple shopped for recycled and sustainable materials, above. Recycled-glass mosaic 
tiles went on in sheets. Bamboo countertops took the place of outdated laminate.

cabinet bridges a space between the

drawers as storage, below left. Label 
each drawer and stash dishes, linens,

            Colorful tile, compact fixtures and appliances, and functional storage 
systems help this condo kitchen live larger than its footprint.
small
When your entire condo is only 750 
square feet, the kitchen is necessarily 
small. Such is the case in this pint-size 
home. The natural light, hardwood ﬂ oors, and 
stunning woodwork were all worth saving. Not 
so pleasant, however, was the nearly unworkable 
layout, lack of storage, and short and shallow 
cabinetry. To make the old space work for 
modern living, it was remade with a country-in-
the-city look.
 
Removing one half-wall opened the kitchen 
to make the limited space more accessible. Vinyl 
ﬂ ooring got the heave-ho to reveal the original 
beautiful hardwood ﬂ oors. 
 
Af er layers of old paint were stripped to 
reveal original glass panels, the upper cabinets 
were rehung higher on the wall to visually 
expand the space. Custom lower cabinets were 
installed, allowing room to integrate a suite of 
small-scale appliances. New bronze hardware 
(coupled with copper accents) adds to the room’s 
vintage feeling.
 
Bright white and other basic neutrals swathe 
the bulk of the kitchen and adjoining dining 
area. It’s OK to be bold in a tight space when 
graphic pat erns are used in small doses, such 
as this kitchen’s backsplash and the adjacent 
dining room’s area rug. If you grow tired of the 
splashy look, it’s easy to change.
 
The small kitchen is ﬁ nished with layers of 
easy-to-change accessories that continue the 
color story. Vintage touches and artifacts bring 
the space to life without costing big dollars.
 
A framed pegboard provides practical and 
inexpensive storage. It occupies underused wall 
space and frees room in drawers and cabinets. 
Hung near the kitchen’s prep space, it keeps 
needed tools in easy reach.
Clear view Glass-front cabinets appear to expand a tiny kitchen, opposite. The insides are painted a deep 
blue. The color recedes, helping with the visual trickery. By the numbers A suite of slim appliances, such 
as this refrigerator, make it possible to pack a full and functional kitchen into a small space, above.

What they did...
This small kitchen is bright, open, and practical thanks to a new layout, custom 
lower cabinets, and a suite of small-scale appliances that offer full-size 
function, above. In a small room, don’t let large appliances eat up valuable 
floor space. This slim gas range provides plenty of functionality in its 24 inches. 
Concealed by cabinetry panels are a whisper-quiet 18-inch dishwasher (left of 
the sink) and a narrow refrigerator (right of the range). The apron-front sink 
was chosen to look expansive but is actually quite small by modern standards.

Strategies for 
small kitchens
These designer tricks go a long way in 
helping a petite kitchen look roomier 
and function more eﬀ ectively.
1. Got it pegged Legendary cook 
Julia Child used a pegboard to keep 
utensils organized in her kitchen. Steal 
her smart idea for practical storage 
by framing a basic pegboard and 
outﬁ tting it with hooks. 
2. Wide open An apron-front sink 
looks larger than its size, perfect 
for a small space. A high-arc faucet 
enhances the shallow basin.
3. Big shot Choose one area in the 
room and make a style statement. 
Handmade Moroccan concrete tiles 
on the backsplash add a graphic 
punch of color. 
4. Gather round The dining area 
takes advantage of sunlight streaming 
through the large windows. A round 
pedestal table provides maximum 
legroom in the small space, which is 
deﬁ ned by a colorful area rug.

FOR STYLE
                      Packed with smart planning and can-do projects, this kitchen 
   is a family hub for crafting, working, lounging—and, yes, cooking.
recipe
No longer a space used just for 
cooking, the kitchen is the hub of 
most homes. To boost function, start with 
space planning. The foundation of any kitchen 
is cabinetry. Ready-to-assemble products are a 
money-saving alternative to custom cabinets. 
Here, they’re used to create distinct zones—one 
for cooking and another for dining and working.  
 
An island made from stock pieces anchors 
one side of the room, while a built-in breakfast 
nook and desks give the other side new purpose.  
Stock cabinetry also allows for creativity, such 
as ﬁ t ing a wine rack into a slim spot beside the 
fridge or placing three upper cabinets between 
vertical panels to create a hutch.
 
Don’t be afraid to mix it up when it comes to 
countertops and cabinets. In this kitchen, a mix 
of whitewashed counters, white and light birch 
cabinets, and butcher-block island countertop 
are visually interesting and united by a single 
ﬁ nish for the hardware.
 
Once the essentials are in place, add the 
colorful elements to make the room cozy and 
personal. Scrapbooking paper and alphabet 
stickers from an oﬃ  ce supply store create 
fun labels for the glass-front island drawers. 
Silhouet es cut from contact paper adhered to 
yellow mat board become graphic artwork. Two 
small rugs stitched together create a low-price, 
high-impact area rug.
 
Sof en a kitchen’s hard lines with fabric. For a 
quick window treatment, sew a simple valance, 
at ach grommets, and hang with S-hooks. 
Add an unexpected slipcover to kitchen stools 
with a graphic fabric. Cover a pantry or hutch 
opening with a hemmed piece of fabric. Appliqué 
a favorite motif, cut from fabric, onto a plain tea 
towel.
Functional fun Though it looks like the work of a pro, this kitchen is a DIYer’s dream, opposite. Flat-pack 
cabinets are easy to assemble and install. The open floor plan caters to the way a modern family lives. 
Hang it up An inexpensive rail system with S-hooks provides the perfect spot to keep cooking utensils off 
the countertop but still handy, above.

Custom solution
Two pieces placed back to back form 
this island, above left. On one side, 
drawers conceal clutter, and on the

tools within easy reach. 
Appliance garage
Two panels, hung from a tension rod, 
create this pretty appliance garage for 
hiding small items, such as the toaster 
and coffeemaker, below left. Buttons 
keep the panels open when needed.

Custom carpentry can be costly, 
but you can get the look of a 
built-in breakfast nook for a lot less 
dough. Sandwich over-the-fridge 
cabinets between two closets 
outﬁ tted with stock cabinets, 
desktops, and open shelving, this 
photo. Top the bench with a thick, 
comfy cushion. Give an outdated 
oak table a bold new look with a 
couple of coats of bright blue paint 
(be sure to prep the table ﬁ rst).

Hanging tough Think you don’t have room for a buffet? 
Think again. This DIY design is made from medium-density 
fiberboard (MDF) and attached to the wall with an 
inconspicuous French cleat.
Sneak peek Using glass fronts on a few cabinets helps 
break up expanses of cabinetry and makes it possible to 
display pretty dishes that match the decor. Just a couple of 
glass-front doors can make a big impact.
Sweet shelf Fill a space between cabinets with a ledge for 
displaying collections or grab-and-go essentials. Open 
shelving infuses a casual, contemporary feeling. Hooks give 
you the option to use hanging storage.

IDEAS FOR
how to create
a chef’s treat
Good planning makes it possible to have 
everything you need close at hand.
1. Pleasing pullouts Make it easier to ﬁ nd the tool or 
ingredient you need by choosing cabinets with rollout 
shelves and deep drawers instead of ﬁ xed shelves. 
2. Hidden treasures Keep countertops clear of clut er 
by stowing small tools in cubbies or an appliance garage. 
Mount tension rods vertically inside a cabinet to keep 
baking sheets upright and organized.
3. Hang in there Convert wasted space into storage 
space by put ing of en-used items on display. Use a 
magnetic strip mounted to a backsplash for knives, 
for example, or keep pots and pans convenient with a 
hanging pot rack.

Shelve the issue Expand storage space by hanging 
shelves on a small stretch of wall next to cabinetry. Narrow, 
angled shelves won’t intrude into a traffic path. Adhere 
wallpaper inside the cabinet for interest.
Short stack In an open kitchen with minimal wall space, 
use a pair of shelves to hold those items that are interesting to 
look at as well as useful. A recessed microwave frees counter 
space in a small kitchen.
Dine in style Turn a corner of the kitchen into a breakfast 
nook by creating bench seating using cushion-topped upper 
cabinets trimmed in baseboard. A round table is a smart 
space-saver.
Easy island An island made from two hollow-core doors 
becomes a spacious workstation. Underneath, cabinets made 
from MDF and filled with cubbies are a perfect spot to stash 
various sundries for easy access.

DREAMS
                    Give an ordinary bedroom a splash of sunshine and pattern
with a lively color palette and a handful of easy-does-it projects. 
sweet
This cheerful bedroom was once a 
boring white box, but its new peppy blue-
and-yellow palet e would make anyone smile. 
The remake started by covering the walls with 
yellow paint and the ﬂ oor with a colorful rug.
 
The windows are dressed in clearance 
curtains, which were extended to ﬂ oor-length by 
stitching remnant fabric to the bot om of each 
panel. Another discount panel was cut and sewn 
into coordinating pillowcases. 
 
Bright blue is used sparingly as a high-
impact accent. To create a statement headboard, 
cut medium-density ﬁ berboard (MDF) into a 
curvaceous shape. Paint the edges white, 
then wallpaper it with a large-scale, eye-popping 
pat ern.
 
Another pop of blue comes from the heart 
pillow made from 22 yards of ¾-inch grosgrain 
ribbon. To make it, sew a single running stitch 
near one edge of the ribbon, then pull the thread 
to ruﬄ  e. Hand-stitch the ribbon in a heart shape 
to fabric, working your way from the outside 
in, securing concentric heart shapes inside one 
another until ﬁ lled in. Use the embellished 
fabric to construct a pillow using a 2-inch 
boxing strip, piping, and fabric back.
 
This small bedroom is also packed with 
storage-savvy ideas. Drawers in the bench hide 
out-of-season clothes. A wicker basket keeps 
spare blankets handy for cold nights. A metal 
bread box is repurposed to hold hair essentials.  
 
Other small items are stowed in a variety of 
boxes covered in palet e-pleasing papers.
The vanity area is as pret y as it is practical. 
To sof en the seat of the ﬂ ea market chair, two 
cot on napkins were sewn together, with a layer 
of quilt bat ing sandwiched between, and tuf ed 
with perle cot on to make a cushion. 
Bright side A modest budget need not cramp your style. For a thrifty way to take your bedroom from 
dreary to cheery, splash on vibrant hues with paint, fabric, and wallpaper projects, opposite. Stash factor 
An easy-sew pouch made of remnant fabric organizes makeup brushes, above. Stitch several pockets to suit 
your needs. Roll up your caddy and close with a ribbon.

Better half
Easy access makes the morning routine 
quicker. Fashion wall pockets for 
makeup and other small items by 
cutting wooden bowls in half and 
screwing them onto a painted board, 
which you can attach to the wall or the 
base of a sturdy mirror, above.
Small stuff
Raid the dollar store and the kitchen for 
various tins and pans to tidy a vanity 
drawer, above left. For a cohesive look, 
glue pretty paper scraps to the tops and 
use rub-on letters as labels.
Branch out
Take the term jewelry tree literally with 
this clever idea, below left. Cover a dry, 
sturdy branch with several coats of 
high-gloss paint. Screw the finished 
piece to a painted wooden block.
Cheap chic
A DIY headboard made of inexpensive 
MDF hangs away from the wall thanks 
to a 2×3-inch wood cleat, below.

revived the piece for just a 
few dollars.

    pair with modern DIY furniture to create a cozy retreat.
overnight
Making guests feel at home starts 
with a welcoming bed. Daybeds are 
super functional but can look out of place in 
a contemporary home. Not this one. With clean, 
straight lines and sleek upholstery, this modern 
daybed is a worthy focal point.
 
The platform was constructed from one 
sheet of ¾-inch MDF. Walnut trim, mitered 
at the corners, is used to hide the MDF’s raw 
edges. The entire platform was stained chocolate 
brown before the addition of heavy-duty 
hairpin legs.
 
Atop the platform is a twin-size memory-
foam mat ress, which is not only incredibly 
comfortable but also oﬀ ers a smooth surface 
(no stitching or tuf ing to show through the 
upholstery). The mat ress cover is secured with 
hook-and-loop tape along the back seam so it 
can be removed for cleaning. Corded welting is 
a simple detail for a professional-looking ﬁ nish 
that lends the look of an upholstered piece 
of furniture.
 
A made-to-ﬁ t bolster pillow serves as a back 
when the daybed is in sofa mode. Make one to 
speciﬁ cations by having an upholstery foam 
company cut foam to size. Cover the pillow 
with the same fabric as the bed for a modern 
monochromatic look.
 
This daybed cost less than $800—a steal for 
both a bed and a sofa. A DIY bench made from 
concrete legs and a walnut top continues the 
modern style through the room.
 
An earth-and-sky palet e and outdoorsy 
accents ground the modern furniture and keep 
the room’s overall look inviting. Flower-ﬁ lled 
vases, a birdhouse, tree-branch hooks, and lots 
of organic shapes make this a room a guest may 
never want to leave.
Back to nature Make your guest room feel like a treehouse retreat with walls that look like wood grain, 
opposite. The look is easy to create using an inexpensive wood-grain tool from the paint store. Branch 
out Nature-inspired pillows are easy to create, above. Sew a driftwood-shape pillow from brown fabric; add 
yarn embroidery. Stitch crocheted leaves and leather-wrapped cord (for a stem) onto a purchased pillow.

What they did...
Storage crates are inexpensive and practical end tables, above. Stained to 
match the daybed, one of the crates is turned on end and filled with reading 
material for guests. A top was cut to fit the other; it is used to store clean linens 
and extra toiletries. Adding a label to the box lets guests feel empowered to 
peek inside without feeling like they are snooping. Decorate the bedside tables 
with bed-and-breakfast amenities, such as a clock and water-filled carafe, to 
make guests feel at home.

Maximize function by creating a combination 
guest room and home oﬃ  ce.
Command central Use a series of framed 
chalkboards, pegboards, and corkboards to keep 
oﬃ  ce notes tidy. When guests are in town, the 
boards can be used to leave messages, maps,

Take charge Hide unsightly cords by drilling a 
hole in the back of an old toolbox to convert it 
into a charging station. Let guests know they can 
use it during their visit.
Basket case Use lidded wicker baskets to quickly 
stash messes in case of unannounced visitors.
On a roll A movable table, like the acrylic one in 
this room, can be used as a work surface or rolled 
out of the way when not needed.
Small things Even if you use the room as an

niceties for a guest. An alarm clock, a portable 
fan, and a TV are all great ways to show your 
visitors you care.

BIG FUN
              Kids and clutter go together like peanut butter and jelly. Help your 
    little one keep her bedroom tidy with these storage solutions.
lit le girl,
This room is packed with child-size 
storage solutions, starting with a smart 
DIY bed. A twin bed tops a wide pullout that can 
be ﬁ lled with toys or blankets—or outﬁ t ed with 
an additional mat ress to function as a trundle 
bed for sleepovers.
 
Building the twin-size bed into the wall like 
a daybed allows plenty of open play space in the 
center of the room. Stock cabinetry components 
from a home center ﬂ ank the ends of the bed, 
serving as built-in bedside tables that oﬀ er 
a lot more storage capacity than the average 
nightstand.
 
Up top and within easy reach of the bed, a 
divided drawer unit functions as an imaginative 
place to stash trinkets—hair bows, lip balms, 
and tiny doll shoes. 
 
The room’s storage high point grew from 
an inauspicious closet with odd angles. The 
doorway was widened for bifold French doors, 
making it a true walk-in. Af er a section of wall 
was knocked out and insulation was added, 
cabinets and carpet squares were installed. Now 
a once-wasted dormer space earns its keep. 
 
Double rods hold tons of clothing, while a 
new window seat oﬀ ers a space to dress in the 
morning or just kick back with a book. Packed 
into the eaves of the home is the equivalent of 
a built-in dresser to hold folded clothes. The 
display-front drawers more commonly used to 
store dry goods in a kitchen now hold grab-and-
go needs.
 
Another way to reduce clut er is to ﬁ nd toys 
that serve as storage pieces. The appliances in 
this room’s play kitchen set oﬀ er ample storage 
space for dishes and toys. 
 
One last tip: Swap out the color palet e and 
this room plays just as hard for a lit le boy.

In the zone
Home center cabinets pump 
up the storage in this closet 
under the eaves, above. Open 
shelves are filled with colorful 
boxes. Clear bins are perfect 
for grab-and-go items such as 
socks and mittens. A small peg 
rack keeps coats and hats 
handy. 
Hang out
French bifold doors and built-in 
storage give the once-awkward 
closet style and function, right. 
A window seat offers a quiet 
spot to perch, while parallel 
clothes rods double the 
hanging potential for clothes.
Open up
Using space efficiently allows a 
bedroom to double as a 
playroom. Tucking the bed 
parallel to the wall opens up 
floor space in the center of the 
room, opposite.
Kids simply overﬂ ow with 
creativity. Give them a place 
to express themselves with a 
framed art station hung at kid 
height. Dry-erase markers work 
on the mirrored side, while 
magnetic chalkboard paint 
makes the other side a place 
to draw or hang artwork.

Bonus closets When a room’s architecture leaves you 
with little wall space, make the most of what you have with 
built-in storage.  Simple closets that follow the lines of the 
roof use every inch.
Bunk mate Custom-designed bunk beds include built-in 
storage on one end with shelves for books. Building the beds 
into a corner leaves more floor space for play and study.
Hook up Place a daybed against a wall in a small bedroom 
to make room for play on the floor. Add a wall shelf and 
hooks to make the most of your vertical space.

IDEAS FOR
how to create
personal space
Streamline your bedroom and make it the 
serene haven you’ve always desired.
1. Season swap Under-bed containers can hold out-of-
season clothes to leave closet space for those items in 
heavy rotation. Purchase rolling bins or make your own 
by adding casters to suitcases or old dresser drawers. 
2. Divide and conquer Use freestanding shelves or 
curtains to create zones within a bedroom for sleeping, 
TV watching, working, and dressing. 
3. Drawer ideas Deep drawers aren’t always used to 
their maximum potential. Stackable trays, dividers, 
and small boxes can be used to keep like items together 
while still using the full depth of a drawer.

On the wall Install wall-mounted shelves around the bed. 
Shop for ready-made units or make your own with brackets 
and a board. Bedside ledges take up zero floor space.
Behind closed doors In a room without adequate closet 
space, adapt an armoire to suit your needs. Keep small items 
tidy in boxes and bins, and stash jewelry on a wire panel 
attached to the door.
Shelve it If you lack storage oomph, add it with simple 
shelving. (These were made with bifold doors.) Decorative 
suitcases work like drawers on the shelves to conceal items.
Tucked in Outfitted with a daybed, the end of a hallway 
provides bonus sleeping space. Pull the curtain for privacy. 
Shelves are a great choice for limited floor space.

EVERYONE
              Office for mom, art room for kids, and romper place for pups, this 
     reinvented basement space is now the hardest-working room in the house. 
something for
Adding bold color, maximizing space, 
and including personal touches turned 
a dark, underused basement into a bright and 
cheery oﬃ  ce.
 
Whitewashed pine laminate ﬂ ooring 
replaced wall-to-wall beige carpet and white 
paint covered the beige walls. To pump up the 
volume, color was added with furniture and 
accents. A large area rug, made of carpet tiles, 
introduces the room’s palet e of turquoise blue, 
golden yellow, olive green, and chocolate brown. 
A dynamic layout serves both adult and child 
needs. The room is divided into zones to smooth 
the traﬃ  c ﬂ ow, and easy-to-install casters make 
the furniture movable for more ﬂ exibility. 
 
A bench under the window provides storage 
and a comfy seat for kids and pets. A cabinet 
stashes the kids’ craf  supplies. Side-by-side 
desks line the adjoining wall to create the home 
oﬃ  ce. The center table connects all the areas, 
and is the perfect mix of work and play space.
 
To make the oﬃ  ce feel homey, the owner’s 
love of books and typography guided the design. 
Books are displayed prominently. Framed dust 
jackets serve as artwork. Printed and framed 
quotations from Alice’s Adventure in Wonderland 
and Where the Wild Things Are currently take 
center stage, but the quotes can be changed 
whenever inspiration strikes. 
 
Oversize let ers made from contact paper 
become graphic artwork on the walls. A variety 
of interesting fonts were chosen and printed 
to scale. Tip: You can enlarge let ers at the 
copy store to supersize them. Use the let er as 
a stencil to cut around on color contact paper 
(sold online). If you don’t want to place the let er 
directly on your wall, place it on mat board, then 
frame and hang it instead.
Multipurpose room Adjustable furniture is a smart pick in a shared space. The room’s center table 
moves up or down according to the user’s needs—short for kid art projects, tall for mom’s work needs, 
opposite. By the letter Personalize pillows with iron-on transfer paper, above. Print an image to the 
desired size in reverse on the paper (select reverse in the print menu setup), place on pillow, and iron over it.

diy tip            
Sit a spell
To create a window seat 
without the expense of 
built-ins, top a bench with a 
cushion covered in upholstery-
grade fabric, above. 
The art of display
When curating a DIY gallery, 
create a casual, collected 
look by selecting a mix of 
media to frame, from old book 
jackets to fabric and graphic 
posters, right. 
Need to hide dog fur and 
kid messes? The bright, fun 
fabrics in this room are all 
upholstery-grade, which are 
designed to take more wear 
than multipurpose or drapery-
weight fabrics. Waterproof, 
fade-free outdoor fabric is 
another durable choice.

What they did...
In a space shared by parent and child, nothing can be precious. Carpet squares 
can easily be changed out in case of spills, above. A painted storage unit is free 
of doors that can shut on tiny fingers. The kids’ craft supplies are kept on lower 
shelves while adult items are purposely elevated out of reach in mailboxes-
turned-supply-caddies and on inspiration boards made of framed cork tiles. 
A slipcover protects the beanbag chair from spills and can be regularly washed 
clean of finger paint, glue, and dog fur. A pocket bearing an iron-on transfer 
stores reading material.

A repurposed console provides 
storage for art supplies, above.

SEW HAPPY
             Filled with savvy storage solutions and pretty decorative touches, 
    this hardworking craft room is sure to inspire your creative side.
so simple, 
In a room designed for everything 
from sewing and paper craf ing to gif  
wrapping and computing, it’s important to make 
every inch count. To make the most of limited 
space, this craf  room employs activity-speciﬁ c 
zones that allow for easy access. 
 
A closet tricked out with inexpensive stock 
cabinetry becomes a seamstress’s dream space. 
It oﬀ ers behind-doors storage for a sewing 
machine and other tools, and open shelving 
to display pret y fabric. A new generation of 
powder-coated magnetic steel pegboard is ultra 
sleek and creates a tidy resting spot for scissors, 
ribbon, but ons, and more.
 
Placed end to end, a duo of inexpensive 
sideboards creates a long bank of storage 
for paper-craf ing supplies. Clever ideas for 
corralling stuﬀ  abound, from a dish drainer for 
sewing pat erns to candy dishes for ribbon and 
other small baubles. Open lower shelves keep 
kids’ art supplies accessible so they can put their 
imaginations to work.
 
The room’s other furniture pieces were also 
chosen for their ability to multitask. A buﬀ et 
is recast as a large desk for sewing, craf ing, 
or computer work. It supplies the room with 
additional out-of-sight storage. A gate-leg table 
provides on-demand work space for wrapping 
gif s as needed.
 
This creative room isn’t all work and no 
play—it also serves up a big dose of style. A 
stenciled wall provides a tone-on-tone pat erned 
canvas to accentuate artwork. Punchy purple 
fabric accents the largely green room. A white 
upholstered chair gets a sassy slipcover to 
help it ﬁ t the room’s palet e. A swivel-chair kit 
transforms the stationary seat into a rolling 
oﬃ  ce chair.
Supply closet Convert a closet into an ultimate storage zone, using off-the-shelf components, opposite. 
The easy-to-assemble units and optional add-on drawers and doors make it a snap to design a storage 
center. Creative caddies Keep control of unruly ribbon or other small supplies by using inexpensive 
kitchen canisters or candy jars to group items by color, above.

What they did...
Don’t be afraid to change furnishings—old or new—to suit your needs. A 
thrift-store buffet with flirty curves was modified to become a sturdy, 
storage-heavy desk, above. A coat of fresh green paint, wallpaper on the 
doors and drawers, and pretty glass hardware give the buffet a new look. A 
tabletop made of painted MDF expands the work surface and provides space 
to showcase fun and functional accessories. Adding a 2-inch riser (also 
painted white) above the shapely metal legs allows them to support the 
desktop’s overhanging surface.

Curtain call
Replace restrictive bifold closet doors 
with pretty curtains, above. These 
vibrant purple tie-top panels visually 
soften the cabinetry and can be drawn 
to keep closet contents out of view.
Storing supplies
Hardworking doesn’t mean plain or boring. Try 
these ideas for organizing supplies with style.  
It’s a wrap This compact gate-leg table is low 
proﬁ le when not in use, yet is a workhorse

Drawers hold bows, tags, tapes, and scissors.

of the table to make room for long rolls of 
wrapping paper.
Hang it up Repurpose the drawers as a wall-
mounted ribbon dispenser. A dowel installed inside 
holds spools, which dispense through holes drilled 
into the drawer. Top the drawer with a shelf for 
artwork and supplies.
Old is new Repurpose vintage ﬁ nds for clever 
storage. On the desk, an old chicken feeder with 
wiry inserts provides categorized storage for 
stationery, left.

double-duty
Converting a small bedroom into a 
multipurpose work space is a smart 
way to get maximum function out of your 
home for minimal money. The transformation 
in this room started by swapping carpet for 
vinyl ﬂ ooring, a durable solution for rooms that 
get heavy use. Typically used in commercial 
applications, the easy-to-install boards give the 
look of wood ﬂ oors for a fraction of the cost.
 
With a fresh coat of cheery blue paint, the 
oﬃ  ce was ready for its star player: the desk. 
Made of walnut-veneer medium-density 
ﬁ berboard (MDF), the large work surface sits on 
two legs and a piece of stainless steel, which is 
bolted to a custom storage cabinet below. A large 
shelf above the desk provides plenty of space 
for storing books, magazines, and ﬁ les, and a 
variety of interesting containers. 
 
On the opposite wall, a closet becomes a 
storage-packed hobby area. Replacing the doors 
with a pair of curtain panels provides access 
to valuable extra inches and, when the inside 
of the closet is painted to match the walls, 
visually extends the room. Stencil let ers add an 
inspiring message on the wall.
 
Old ﬁ ling cabinets are topped with a custom-
cut piece of metal to create a storage-packed 
work surface. Placed on casters, the cabinets 
become a comfortable countertop height for 
wrapping gif s. To give the mismatched cabinets 
a cohesive look, an auto-body shop was hired to 
apply a powder-coat paint job. Tip: Most shops 
have a minimum fee, so paint some accessories 
while you’re at it.
 
Metal pegboard above the cabinets puts all 
the necessary craf s supplies in one place, while 
baskets are used to store larger papers and 
accessories.
Bright idea Use a decorative dining chair, colorful containers, and unusual artwork to soften the hard 
lines of a desk, opposite. Stylish shelf Above the desk is a matching shelf made from sturdy MDF and 
veneer. Inexpensive wood shelf brackets, painted white, soften the modern look, above.

Stash the wraps 
Create a tool belt for wrapping supplies 
using a strip of scrap fabric with a 
hook-and-loop fastener on the back, 
above. Create little pockets to store tags, 
scissors, stickers, and more.
Creative containers 
Keep your space clutter-free with clever 
containers, above left and below left. 
Use jars for ribbon, boxes for paints, and 
divided plastic bins for buttons and 
brads. Metal pails hold color pencils.
On the wall
Open-sided magazine files are a great 
place to stash scrapbook papers; the 
sheets slide without tearing, below.
All the trimmings 
A pegboard system can be used in a 
kitchen, garage, or anywhere that needs 
organization. In a hobby closet, the 
hooks and shelves can be rearranged as 
needed to manage supplies efficiently, 
opposite.

Second wind Don’t purchase a pricey desk if you can 
repurpose an old vanity with a coat of paint. Install shelves 
above and use coordinating boxes for a tidy look. Clear tubs 
make top-shelf items easy to find.
Small but mighty  Shelves decorated with cork circles 
are functional and artful. A cushion-topped stool provides 
comfy seating that can be tucked under the desk when not in 
use. Using bins as drawers adds easy storage.
By design Semicustom cabinetry is an affordable way to 
turn a small stretch of wall into a built-in desk. Explore design 
options at a cabinetry store or home center. Or measure your

IDEAS FOR
how to create
an oﬃ  ce that works
Turn any part of your home into an oﬃ  ce 
with storage-smart ideas for eﬃ  cient 
organization.
1. Divide and conquer When space is limited, zone a 
section of a larger room (such as a kitchen or a family 
room) as a work area. Or carve space out of an awkward 
niche or a closet. 
2. Up the wall Make the most of your oﬃ  ce area by 
taking storage vertical with wall-mounted cubbies, 
shelves, magnetic strips, corkboards, and other 
hardworking tools. 
3. Hidden gems To keep your work area clut er-free, 
incorporate as much concealed storage as possible. 
Drawers and cabinets are functional and don’t distract

A place to create For a crafting work space, add storage 
all around. Stock cabinets provide an abundance of drawers, 
and a pegboard wall offers many options for keeping 
supplies at your fingertips.
Rethink your space Convert a closet into an inexpensive 
workstation. Paint the interior of the closet, and add a desk and 
off-the-shelf storage cubbies. Install a pendant lamp to 
illuminate the small space.
Corner office If you’re lucky enough to have a large 
corner or an entire room for an office, a U-shape design will 
maximize storage and work space. Place the desk near a 
window to take advantage of natural light.
No-frills approach No money or room for a big office? 
A narrow desk eats up little floor space. The metal wall panel 
corrals clutter on shelves and in bins in a sliver of space.

When tackling laundry, an organized 
and bright room eases the chore. At 
a mere 6×11 feet, this pret y laundry room 
provides a place for everything while cleverly 
camouﬂ aging washday essentials. The key to 
the room’s success is the strategic separation 
of the washer and dryer, which are visually 
minimized by pat erned skirts. The unusual 
approach frees ﬂ oor space to maneuver in the 
small area. 
 
The dryer tucks neatly into a corner, and an 
adjacent drying rack unfolds from the wall for 
air-drying delicate clothes under the room’s 
window. A laminate countertop installed 1 inch 
above the dryer provides a surface for folding 
and sorting.
 
The front-loading washing machine is 
placed for easy access, and laundry supplies 
are conveniently stored on shelves above. 
Floating shelves hold detergent, fabric sof ener, 
and cleaning supplies in at ractive labeled 
containers.
 
Simple add-ons transform a forget able 
broom closet near the door into a vertical 
laundry hamper. With the door removed and 
shelves installed, labeled laundry baskets are 
used to sort clothes by color. 
 
Ironing supplies hang neatly on one wall, 
taking up almost no space. Silhouet es painted 
on the spring-green wall mimic the shapes of an 
iron, spray bot le, and ironing board and remind 
the user to put equipment away. Practical carpet 
squares on the ﬂ oor are easy on the feet and can 
be replaced as needed.
 
The bright color palet e uplif s, while bold 
fabrics sof en the space. As a ﬁ nal ﬂ ourish, a 
sparkling chandelier illuminates the room with 
a touch of glamour.
Bright idea Vibrant green paint, fun fabrics, and clutter-catching projects make this laundry room a 
pleasure to work in and super functional, opposite. For a lighthearted touch, oversize laundry icons decorate 
the walls. Grab & go Corral small items in decorative dishware. Keep everything organized by adding 
colorful labels attached with painted clothespins, above.

What they did...
Match-and-stash silhouettes make it clear where to hang the ironing board, 
iron, and spray bottle, above. Trace the shapes onto the back of repositionable 
adhesive-back paper. Cut out the shapes and apply them to the wall. Paint the 
wall, coating the adhesive-back paper, and remove the pieces before the paint 
is fully dry. Spray-paint a sleek picture ledge and a wall-mounted herb planter 
to coordinate with the space. Use the ledge to house supplies and turn the 
planter into an at-hand clothespin caddy.
Splash color onto 
the legs of an ironing 
board. Rough up the 
original paint with 
sandpaper and wipe 
with a tack cloth. 
Coat the metal base 
with primer; let dry. 
Spray-paint the legs 
with several light 
applications, allowing 
paint to fully dry 
between coats.
diy tip           
The low-proﬁ le

is mounted on 
the wall with 
two basic hooks. 
Attach the hooks

Streamlined 
storage
If your laundry piles are high and your 
room’s functionality is low, use these 
solutions to increase storage.
1. Out to dry A wall-mounted drying 
rack makes the most of a sliver of 
space under the room’s lone window. 
The rack folds tight against the wall 
when not in use. Colorful clothespins 
hold garments in place.
2. Walls that wow For big bang 
without big bucks, create a bold 
accent wall using repositionable 
adhesive-back paper cut in a fun 
pattern, such as these clothespins. 
The treatment works best when the 
adhesives are applied over ﬂ at, fully 
cured paint and then painted over.
3. Lesson learned Vintage 
illustrations from an old sewing book 
become fun artwork when placed in 
brightly colored frames.
4. Sort it out Make the most of a 
closet by using it as a sorting station. 
Remove the door, ﬁ ll any holes with 
wood putty, and paint the molding to 
match the space. Use baskets to sort 
clothes by color.

WONDERS
                  It’s hard to beat this laundry room when it comes to performance 
      per square foot. Try some of these space planning ideas at home.
lit le
Laundry rooms are notoriously stingy 
on square footage, and this corner utility 
space is no exception. But what it lacks in space, 
this utility area more than makes up for in space 
planning.
 
An angled cabinet utilizes an awkward 
corner, creating room for supply storage and a 
must-have utility sink for rinsing and soaking. 
The window brightens the room with natural 
light, but it limits the amount of wall space 
available for cabinetry and shelving. Gains are 
made with a stackable washer and dryer. A small 
cabinet above the appliances goes to the ceiling, 
adding even more storage. Inexpensive laminate 
countertop provides an area for folding laundry. 
Drawers and doors keep cleaning supplies out of 
view, making the whole room appear tidy.
 
The best way to expand a laundry room’s 
storage capacity is to take advantage of space 
that would otherwise go unused. In less than 
a day, you can cut into the wall between two 
studs, add drywall to ﬁ nish the niche, insert a 
stock cabinet, and then trim with molding.
 
Another space-savvy solution in this laundry 
room is a recessed wall cabinet that conceals a 
drop-down ironing board. Available at any home 
improvement center and easy to install, these 
cabinets take up very lit le space and not only 
tuck away a board but usually have room for an 
iron and small supplies.
 
To keep laundry from feeling like a chore, 
use a nature-inspired color palet e. Crisp white 
cabinets are delightful in a small but orderly 
space. The accents take their color cues from 
plants, lakes, and sunrises, and fabrics on 
the windows and ﬂ oor help sof en the utilitarian 
room.
Push the limits For laundry, ironing, memos, and mail, this room makes every inch count, opposite. 
Double-duty designs and wall-busting solutions make this little laundry room live large. Tall order Make 
the most of a narrow slice of wall by crafting a DIY growth chart to track your children’s heights, above.

1. Save the date This message board 
is made from a sheet of galvanized 
metal, cut to ﬁ t by a metal fabricator. 
The calendar is fashioned from 
scrapbook paper that ﬂ aunts a fun 
shape, preprinted calendar, and 
stitching. Just stamp or write the 
months and dates, then hang.
2.  At your service Concealed 
behind the memo board is a narrow 
cabinet that stows a drop-down 
ironing board. Run an electrical outlet 
behind the cabinet and access it by 
cutting an opening in the back.

DREAMS
         A vanity unit made from pipes and shelves is a budget-friendly 
                                     way to get a lot of storage without expensive cabinetry.
pipe
This fun bathroom gets a bold start 
with bright yellow walls and graphic 
gray and white cork ﬂ oors set in a 
chevron pat ern. The natural cork was treated at 
the factory with a color coating and protective 
ﬁ nish that makes it suitable to a wet application, 
such as a bathroom. The tiles were also cut into 
parallelograms at the factory, which minimized 
the number of cuts required to set the pat ern on 
the ﬂ oor and wall.
 
In a bathroom remodel, a big chunk of the 
budget goes toward cabinetry. To save costs, 
this wall unit was constructed from galvanized 
plumbing pipes and ﬁ t ings. Shelves made from 
medium-density ﬁ berboard (MDF) provide 
plenty of storage at lit le cost. The shelves were 
painted a glossy white to hold up to bathroom 
moisture. A facing board on a standard MDF 
shelf gives the counter visual hef .
 
One advantage of using pipes and shelves is 
that it allows you to customize your unit to any 
amount of wall space. Just measure your space 
and determine the conﬁ guration you want. 
Purchase one-inch galvanized pipe and ask 
the hardware store to cut and thread it to your 
speciﬁ cations. (Most stores will cut and thread 
pipe at no charge.) 
 
A simple vessel sink is mounted on the 
counter. White subway tile is set in stacks for 
a fresh take on the traditional running bond 
pat ern. Tip: If you can make your shelf the 
same width as the tiles, you can avoid cut ing 
tiles, which further simpliﬁ es the project.
 
A bright fabric skirt at aches to the shelf 
with hook-and-loop tape, creating hidden 
storage for toiletries and cleaning supplies. It 
removes easily for a quick wash or if you want to 
change it out for a new look.
Bright and bold By using bright colors on the walls and a bold pattern on the floor, basic materials such 
as subway tile and a vessel sink look anything but plain, opposite. Light the way In keeping with the 
theme of the pipe shelves, these sconces were created by running a socket kit through pipe and pipe fittings 
and hard-wiring it to the wall, above.

On solid ground 
Base flanges screwed directly into the 
floor ensure these shelves are stable, 
above. A bright fabric skirt creates 
hidden storage. 
Plain and simple 
Save money by keeping the core 
elements in your bathroom simple and 
white like this sink and tile backsplash, 
above left. Add color with towels and 
toiletries.
Up the wall 
The chevron pattern of this floor was so 
interesting, we carried it up the wall, 
below left. It provides some backsplash 
protection behind the bathtub and adds 
a lot of punch to the space.
At the top 
No need to line the top flanges up with 
wall studs; instead, attach them to a 
piece of wood that is screwed securely 
to wall studs, below.

BIG STYLE
                       Making a tiny space live large doesn’t have to cost a fortune. 
    This bath got a pretty new look without breaking the bank.
small bathroom, 
Short on space? This 5×8-foot-bath 
lives large thanks to some easy solutions 
that can be re-created on a budget. This remodel 
started underfoot, with a new ceramic tile ﬂ oor 
that gives a luxurious, well-ﬁ nished look. In a 
small bathroom, it doesn’t take much time to 
install. (If cost comes into play, check out the 
great-looking vinyl tiles on the market.)
 
For a fresh backdrop, beaded board and new 
paint dress the walls. Bright white oﬀ -the-shelf 
millwork paired with colorful paint makes the 
cramped space appear larger—and helps accents 
such as towels and hardware take center stage.
 
Even in a small bath, the vanity can 
announce your personality and set the style of 
the room. Select this piece before choosing the 
room’s other ﬁ nishes and decor. The focal point 
in this bathroom is a clean-lined contemporary 
vanity constructed using pipe found online, a 
limestone slab, and an undermount sink. The 
DIY option was about half the cost of a similar-
looking purchased model. 
 
The custom unit includes legs made of 
1½-inch chrome tubing and ﬁ t ings, which cost 
about $350. For the vanity top, pick through 
remnants at a local stone-supply company 
and ﬁ nd a great deal on a piece of limestone. 
Including charges to custom cut it, the top cost 
about $300.
 
With no room to add full-size shelves or 
a freestanding cabinet, a shelving unit was 
recessed into one wall. A simple wicker basket 
stashed under the sink holds towels—and brings 
natural texture to the room’s hard surfaces. The 
towels provide a lit le extra punch of color in 
the bright-white bathroom. The shower curtain, 
window panels, and area rug also help sof en the 
space.
Bright idea To allow in light from a bathroom window while protecting privacy, install mini shutters and a 
café curtain made from a shower curtain cut to size, opposite. Unexpected storage The bathroom is 
home to all sorts of small items that need wrangling. For a pretty solution to the problem, store soaps, 
makeup, jewelry, and the like in a collection of colored glass dishes, above.

These cross-handle faucets 
with a modern interpretation 
work well with the room’s 
cottage feel and the vanity’s

Closet case
To create sorely needed 
storage and preserve every 
inch of space in a bath, recess a 
shallow shelving unit into the 
wall and hide it behind a door 
fronted in beaded-board 
paneling, right. Adjustable 
shelves allow for tall bottles 
and containers. Head-high 
wainscoting helps blend the 
unit into the background.
Typically 30–32 inches wide, 
a door takes up lots of space 
in a petite bath. Make it shine 
by replacing a cheap-looking, 
ﬂ at-front, hollow-core door 
with a paneled model that 
adds subtle texture and overt 
character to a small room.

Linear storage When floor space is lacking, employ the 
wall above your toilet for storage. Install a trio of shelves to 
display containers filled with small essentials. It’s also a 
perfect spot for decorative accessories.
Out of reach Store items used infrequently on a shelf 
hung above head height. Oversize containers united by a 
single color maximize storage capacity and keep the 
look cohesive.
Reach new heights Tall pieces offer more storage in 
limited square footage. If you have the space, create a 
freestanding hutch as a stand-in for a closet. Top a painted 
flea market dresser with an upper cabinet.

IDEAS FOR
how to create
family baths
When you run out of room—but not out of 
stuﬀ —use these clever tricks to solve your 
storage dilemmas.
1. Try something diﬀ erent A small space demands 
creativity. Use cutlery trays in drawers to organize 
small toiletries. Store makeup and hair accessories 
inside a toolbox. Hang a paper-towel holder inside a 
cabinet door to keep backup rolls of toilet paper handy. 
2. Cut clut er The easiest way to keep organized is 
to frequently throw out unused items. Regularly sort 
through your cabinets to discard expired products or 
anything you no longer use. 
3. A place for everything Label shelf dividers or bins to 
create personal storage spots for each family member.

Claim lost space Gain storage without losing space with 
a cabinet recessed into the wall between studs. (Make the 
look prettier by lining the back of the cabinet with paper.) 
Install a shelf above the sink and cut holes for storage cups.
Table service Make up for your pedestal sink‘s lack of 
counter space with a little table nestled next to it. Use a 
basket or tray to keep small items organized.
Mirror, mirror If your bath doesn’t lend itself to a 
traditional medicine cabinet, get creative and hang a mirror 
on a window. Add frosting spray or film to the window for 
privacy. Stash toiletries in bins and baskets on either side.
Behind doors Keep a closet organized with a rolling 
hamper, wine racks for rolled towels, and a lazy Susan for 
small toiletries. Utilize the back of the door with hooks for 
grab-and-go buckets of shower essentials.

embellished armoire
This trash-ready farmhouse cabinet becomes a 
detail-rich armoire with an application of molding.
1. Make sure the furniture is stable. Shore up any wobbly 
construction issues, and square and level the piece.
2. Lay out moldings on your cabinet, deﬁ ning details as we did with 
the raised panels, or adding detail where there was none. Using a 
miter saw and miter box, cut crown at 45-degree angles. Use wood 
glue to attach moldings and rosettes. Secure with ﬁ nish nails.
3. Sand and prime the cabinet. Then paint it a bold shade, such 
as this sky blue. To give the color depth and accentuate the moldings, 
rub on glaze with a rag, applying extra glaze to corners 
and the moldings.

position a light source behind it for 
sharp contrast.
2. Print the image in a size that ﬁ ts 
your frame and your foam sheet. 
Cut out and trace the image onto 
the foam. Foam provides a slight 
shadow line and depth, or you 
can use thick paper and bump up 
the art with self-adhesive furniture 
protector pads. 
3. Cut the foam, and adhere the 
image to a mat or colorful paper.
4. Set the mat into a frame that 
shows oﬀ  the silhouette. For a more

how to create
ribbon 
accents
Why let gifts get all the glory? Elevate 
ribbons from packaging pretties to 
dramatic decor with these simple 
no-sew techniques.
1. Figure how much ribbon you 
have to work with and plan your 
design before you start. You can get 
a lot of mileage from a little ribbon 
with creative thinking. Use short 
lengths to dress up artwork or to 
wrap around the base of a lamp or 
vase. Longer lengths can add 
impact to tables or window 
treatments, right.
2. At ach ribbon using Sealah 
tape (available at jodeesinc.com), 
a double-sided, pressure-sensitive 
adhesive that works like glue without 
the mess. Attach Sealah tape to 
the ribbon before applying to the 
project. Unlike glue, this acid- and 
lignin-free tape will not yellow over 
time, making it a good choice for 
upholstery and other decorator 
fabric projects. 
3. For fabrics that will receive a 
lot of use (and frequent washing), 
secure the ribbon with machine 
stitching.

Side table A linear table makes a strong statement in an 
entry or hall. The straight lines of the table make it a natural 
candidate to trim with bold lengths of ribbon. 
Lampshade A plain lampshade is a perfect canvas for 
ribbons. We cut short lengths of ribbon (2–4 inches) and 
attached them to the shade at random intervals with Sealah 
tape. This is a fun way to get a lot of style from ribbon scraps.
Napkin Make a custom table setting using ribbons to 
embellish napkins, place mats, and table runners. Sealah tape 
adheres well and is washable.
Upholstery Use ribbon pieces to refresh a shapely wing 
chair on the seat, arms, or back. Mix it up to show off your

painting clear glass.
1. Cover your work surface to 
protect it from spills. Pour a small  
amount of enamel ceramic/glass 
paint into the bottom of a clean and 
dry clear glass vase. 
2. Hold the vase in your hands and 
tip it until the paint rolls around the 
inside, creating waves of color. (You 
can add more paint if you want to 
make larger areas of color.) Tilt in 
diﬀ erent directions and leave some 
of the vase clear for interesting 
contrast. Let excess paint dry in the 
bottom of the vase. For added detail, 
use an oil-base paint marker to 
doodle tiny ﬂ owers on the outside 
of the vase. Let dry.

how to create
wood 
decor
Those wood scraps in your home 
center’s cast-oﬀ  bin are actually 
decorative gems in disguise. 
1. Create custom artwork by using 
a wood block to make a stamp, 
right. The softer the wood, the 
better: Basswood is best, while pine 
is usable, too. If you want a distinct 
wood texture in your print, look for a 
rough stretch of wood; for smooth, 
clean prints, ﬁ nd a smooth block.
2. Draw your design on the block 
or transfer it via carbon paper, then 
use cutting tools to carve away the 
negative space. Tip: Words need to 
be carved backward. Always push 
your carving tool away from your 
hands and body. 
3. Af er carving, use a brayer to 
spread paint or ink over the design, 
then stamp the block on a piece of 
paper cushioned by a dish towel 
(the give of the towel enables you to 
make an even print). After pressing 
down for a few seconds, hold the 
paper immobile and lift the block 
straight up. Let dry and frame the 
print as desired.

how to create
painted 
ﬁ nishes
A can of paint is a budget-minded 
DIYer’s best friend. Here, we show 
you a few of the many surfaces you 
can refurbish with paint. 
1. Every surface accepts a painted 
ﬁ nish a little diﬀ erently, so you’ll 
want to gather as much information 
as possible about your project 
before you begin. As a general rule, 
you’ll need to apply a primer or 
rough up the base of what you’re 
painting with sandpaper so a new 
coat of paint will adhere to it. Wipe 
with a tack cloth.
2. Spray-paint is a great choice for 
painting wicker, such as this chair, 
right. Apply a primer ﬁ rst.  
3. Choose the application—brush, 
roller, or spray—that works best for 
your project. After the ﬁ rst coat is 
dry, sand lightly. Add a second coat.

papier-
mâché
If you think papier-mâché is just for 
grade-schoolers, think again. We 
show you how to raid the recycling 
bin for materials to make chic, 
unique, and free artwork.
1. Shape an animal head, such as 
the deer, from a foam block using a 
crafts knife, right. Tear scrap paper 
into strips. Newspaper is ideal: It’s 
soft and thin, so it molds easily. 
Thicker brown kraft paper also 
works and creates a strong ﬁ nished 
sculpture.
2. Mix 4 parts white glue to 1 part 
water in a bowl. This mixture makes 
strongly bonded projects that can be 
sanded, cut, and drilled like wood.
3. Soak the strips of paper in the 
glue mixture and run them through 
your ﬁ ngers to remove excess glue 
before applying the strips to your 
carved foam. Let each layer of glue 
and paper dry before adding the 
next layer. When dry, the three-
dimensional shapes can be ﬁ nished 
with paint. We mounted our head on 
a decorated plaque.

furniture using a pencil.
3. Drill the holes into the wood. 
If your embroidery design calls for 
curves, you’ll need more holes. If 
you have longer, straighter lines, you 
can get away with using fewer holes.
4. Start stitching. Thread a darning 
needle with yarn and knot the end.

to transfer the pattern to the wood. Or, rub pencil lead on the 
back of the pattern until it is solid gray. Place the paper so the 
gray is against the cabinet. Trace over the lines on the front of 
the sheet with a pen, transferring the pencil lead to the door.
2. Trace over the lines on the door with a wood-burning 
tool. The longer you leave the tool against the wood, the 
darker and wider the line will be. Once ﬁ nished burning the 
wood, paint in the design with crafts paints. 
3. Finish the door with a protective coat of polyurethane.

lacy patchwork
This treatment uses a collection of favorite sheer scraps to create a soft, 
shimmery eﬀ ect.
1. Choose your fabrics and plot out the pattern for the panels on grid 
paper to scale. By using grid paper, you can determine the dimensions of 
each fabric piece you’ll be cutting. Label each section according to the 
fabric used. We used seven diﬀ erent sheers to get this eﬀ ect.
2. Cut fabric, and pin together in rows. Stitch the pieces into rows, and 
then stitch the rows together. Sew a rod pocket, and the side and bottom 
edges to ﬁ nish.

dyed linen strips
Are you searching for the perfect color? Make your own with this dyeing technique.
1. Cut linen into strips. Divide strips into four or ﬁ ve groups. You’ll dye each 
group a diﬀ erent shade. Experiment with colors and saturation levels. We created 
ﬁ ve diﬀ erent colors using red and yellow crafts paint.
2. Mix 1 tablespoon of crafts paint to 1 gallon of water and stir. Test the dye on 
a scrap of linen. Once you’re happy with the color, plunge a length of fabric into 
the mixture. Remove and hang to dry. Repeat until you are happy with the mix of 
colors. Iron the dry fabric to set the color.
3. Line up the strips in alternating colors, then tie to a curtain rod. Cut fabric strips 
to the desired length for coverage. These were cut short to create a café curtain.
diy tip           
Sheer linen is a great 
choice for dyeing, 
because the color 
accentuates the fabric’s 
weave. If you like the 
look, but need more 
privacy, consider 
hanging a sheer 
behind the fabric strips 
to obscure the view.

chevron shade
You only need painter’s tape and an idea to create a geometric stencil 
design that’s easy to roll on with paint.
1. To make a chevron stripe, determine the center point of the 
fabric Roman shade and position the pattern for pleasing symmetry. We 
allowed for 4-inch stripes.
2. Use a plastic artist’s triangle tool (or create your own triangle 
shape out of cardboard) and pencil to trace lines onto the shade. Use a 
straightedge to make sure the chevron stripes are level.
3. Tape above and below the pencil line with painter’s tape (a). Repeat 
for each stripe. Use a brush or roller to paint on fabric paint (b). Remove 
painter’s tape and install the shade once the paint is dry.

woven veneer
You’ll build two frames of the same size for this project—a hidden one from 
cheap poplar that forms the base and a prettier outer frame from maple. 
1. Plan the width and height of your headboard. This will determine 
the length of your maple veneer strips. A thick variety of maple veneer 
called “no black line” is ideal. Measure and cut strips of veneer in three 
widths—2, 3, and 4 inches—and the length and height of your headboard. 
On the poplar frame, measure and mark where strips will be attached.
2. Glue, then staple the shorter strips vertically onto the poplar frame, 
leaving 1 inch between strips (a). Weave the longer strips through the 
vertical veneer strips, alternating the 2-, 3-, and 4-inch widths (b). Start 
weaving the strip through the middle, then push up or down to the 
desired placement, leaving 1 inch between each horizontal strip. 
3. With strips in place, position the poplar frame within the maple 
outer frame. Fasten the two together (c), then coat the unit with clear 
polyurethane. Attach to the bed frame.

headboard. To create the extended 
height of your headboard, mark and 
cut out of a second sheet of MDF a 
rectangular piece the same width as 
the top portion and tall enough to 
create your desired ﬁ nished height. 
3. Align the top MDF panel with the 
bottom board. Apply four mending 
braces to span the seam where the 
two boards meet. Install four more 
braces on the opposite side.

the inspiration for a canopy bed.
1. Create a stencil by 
photocopying our houndstooth 
pattern. For best results, create 
your stencil with frisket, a low-tack 
transparent masking paper (available 
at art supply stores). Or use stencil 
ﬁ lm, adhered with spray adhesive. 
2. Sand, prime, and paint the 
frame in your lighter color. Paint the 
canopy frame and post turnings in 
your darker color. Let dry. 
3. With a pencil and ruler, mark 
a horizontal grid around the bed 
frame to guide the placement of 
your stencil. Adhere the stencil to 
your starting point and ﬁ ll in the 
shape with the darker color using a 
ﬂ at-bristle stencil brush, foam brush, 
or small roller. Carefully reposition 
the stencil while the paint is still wet. 
Continue until the frame, headboard, 
and footboard are complete. Let dry. 
4. To add pat ern to the posts, 
carefully wrap the stencil around the 
edges and curves. Run a credit card 
or burnishing tool over the stencil to 
avoid any gaps. Fill in the stencil with 
paint and let dry.

pattern play
A mix of striking wallpaper patterns boosts interest in a plain room. 
1. Figure the square footage needed for the wallpaper, calculating for 
pattern match. Typically, American double rolls have 72 square feet, and 
metric or European double rolls have 58 square feet.
2. Repair the wall. Be sure the wall is clean and free of mildew, 
adhesives, and chipping paint. Fill nail holes and cracks. Remove 
switchplates and ﬁ xtures; then prime walls using a wallpaper primer.
3. Cut paper, allowing at least 2 inches extra at each end and matching 
the pattern. If your wallpaper isn’t prepasted, mix paste according to 
manufacturer’s instructions. Fold each end toward the center (adhesive to 
adhesive). For more information on wallpaper, turn to page 252.
4. Af er ﬁ ve minutes, unfold the top half and apply the paper to the 
wall using a damp sponge to smooth out wrinkles. Repeat with the 
bottom half. Use a metal ruler and sharp utility knife to trim surplus paper 
at the top and bottom. Roll seams with a seam roller to secure.

plexiglass panels
Inspired by a wall of mirrors, these plexiglass panels add interest and 
dimension to a ﬂ at wall. 
1. Measure your wall and map a pattern on graph paper. Transfer the 
design to the wall with a pencil and a level. Using a nail gun or hammer, 
apply 1×2s to the horizontal lines, checking level as you go and starting 
at the top. Using a miter saw or miter box, cut 1×2s to ﬁ t the vertical lines. 
Attach these to the wall (a).
2. Place plexiglass on a work surface and mark the pattern in pen. Lay a 
straightedge on top, guided by the marks. Score with a scoring tool three 
to four times. Snap apart. Remove the protective ﬁ lm and paint one side.
3. Cut picture molding to ﬁ t each plexiglass perimeter, mitering the 
corners. Nail the bottom molding on ﬁ rst, and position the plexiglass. Nail 
on the sides and top (b). Fill nail holes, sand, prime, and paint the trim.

oversized stencil 
Highlight a focal-point wall with a supersize stencil pattern.  
1. Plot your design before beginning. Experiment with colors 
to get the right mix. We used four shades of neutrals to keep 
the look transitional. Look to aﬀ ordable paint samples or crafts 
paints to get the right palette. 
2. Practice on scrap drywall to perfect the stencil positioning 
and your color scheme.
3. Start in the center of the wall, and work your way to the 
corners. Spray the back of the stencil with repositionable 
adhesive. Pounce the paint onto the wall with a stencil brush.  
You can bend the pliable stencil—or even cut it—to ﬁ nish 
the corners.
gallery display
Turn a section of wall into a rotating art gallery. 
1. Choose two colors in diﬀ erent shades of the same hue. 
Paint the wall your base color and let it dry.
2. Roll on a darker shade of magnetic paint for the 
gallery area. Let it dry. Cut lengths of chair rail molding 
and frame the section of the wall for a ﬁ nished look, or 
simply paint a border.
3. Arrange your artwork. Framed art can be hung on 
nails. Loose pages can be attached using magnets.

caning stencil 
Create a wall grid designed using 2-inch painter’s tape. 
1. Af er painting the wall’s lighter base coat, design a grid. Use 
2-inch painter’s tape to create 18-inch squares divided by horizontal 
and vertical stripes spaced 3 inches apart. 
2. Add angled lines last for best results. With painter’s tape in place, 
apply a light coat of acrylic matte medium before painting the top 
coat. Tip: When planning a tone-on-tone look, consider choosing 
colors that are two or three shades apart on the same paint strip.
3. Remove the tape as soon as the paint is dry, after about two hours.

wood 
panels
Don’t confuse this veneer project 
with pine paneling that went out 
with disco. This is wall art with a light, 
natural feel.  
1. Use graph paper to create a scale 
(1 inch = 1 foot) blueprint for your 
wall. Get creative with the size and 
shape of the pieces. Transfer your 
pattern to the wall with a ruler, level, 
and pencil. Plan to vary the direction 
of the wood grain, placing some 
vertically and some horizontally. 
Mark this on the wall, too.
2. Select your veneer. Veneer 
backed by medium-density 
ﬁ berboard (MDF) provides stability, 
but you could cut your shapes 
from a roll of paper-backed veneer, 
available at most home centers. 
3. When your panels are ready, use 
power adhesive (look for the kind 
in a caulking tube) to aﬃ  x panels to 
the wall, then nail in place for added 
security. Place nails near the outside 
edges of the panels so they’ll be 
concealed when you add molding.
4. Stain and seal molding to 
match the wall panels. Use ﬁ nish 
nails to attach the trim over panel 
seams to complete.

beaded-board wall
This project takes a lot of measuring and cuts. If you’re a beginner, avoid 
placing beaded board on the diagonal. Instead, vary horizontal and 
vertical lines. 
1. Measure your wall and determine how large your squares of beaded 
board will be. Cut squares on the diagonal from a sheet of beaded 
board, matching the beads along the edges. Cut corresponding 2-inch 
horizontal and vertical boards to ﬁ t the wall. Sand, prime, and paint 
the moldings. 
2. Apply the beaded board to the wall, carefully matching the beads and 
nailing every few inches. When all are applied, sand, prime, and paint the 
beaded board.
3. Nail a horizontal board at the top of the wall, covering the beaded 
board’s edges. Attach vertical pieces at the beaded-board intersections. 
Add the second horizontal piece, then repeat the process. Fill nail holes; 
let dry, and touch up with paint.
diy tip           
A pneumatic nail gun 
makes jobs such as 
applying trim moldings 
a lot quicker and easier. 
This tool allows you to

wall decal
Applying a chic monogram decal above a ﬁ replace creates an 
elegant focal point and solves the wall art issue. 
1. Remove any dust and debris from your wall. Choose 
a decal that complements your room. Most mass-market 
retailers carry some peel-and-stick decals. Many more are 
available online.
2. Apply the decal to the wall. Hold it in place with painter’s 
tape. When the image is positioned, use a burnishing tool, such 
as a credit card, to smooth out any air bubbles.
cabin walls
Give your bedroom a relaxed vacation vibe with exposed 2×4s 
and grass cloth.
1. Take inspiration from the rough-hewn walls of an old 
ﬁ shing cabin. This rustic grid was installed on top of drywall 
and designed in a way that allows for plenty of display niches.
2. Wallpaper or paint the walls. Natural grass cloth brings 
an earthy texture to the space. 
3. Prepare 2×4s. Sand rough places in the boards and ﬁ ll 
holes with wood ﬁ ller for a more polished look. Prime the 
boards and let dry. Paint the boards a color of your choosing. 
(White inspires a beach cottage feeling.) Attach to the wall and 
touch up the paint as needed.

dimensional ﬂ owers
Let your walls bloom with handmade ﬂ owers cut from wood veneer.
1. Choose three varieties of veneer in contrasting tones. We used 
walnut burl, maple, and ﬁ g cherry. Draw simple leaf patterns in varying 
sizes on paper, and trace the shapes onto the veneer (a).
2. Carefully cut out leaf shapes (b). It helps to cut around the shape 
roughly at ﬁ rst, then cut precisely around curves. Exotic wood veneers are 
more delicate and prone to splitting than basic wood species.
3. Arrange leaf shapes on a craft wood base (c). Brush glue on the back 
of the shapes. Veneer will curl slightly. Wipe off  excess glue, then set a 
stack of heavy books on top of the leaves to ﬂ atten; let dry.

1. Protect your ﬁ nished walls with plastic sheeting before you begin 
the project. Clean the concrete ﬂ oor with etching liquid or concrete 
cleaner from the hardware store, according to manufacturer’s directions. 
Wear protective eyewear and gloves. The compound gets foamy. Brush 
it on the ﬂ oor with a stiﬀ -bristle broom to degrease the surface and 
rough up the concrete so that it can accept the stain.
2. Rinse oﬀ  the compound with water using a hose. Suck up the water 
with a wet vac or rinse down a drain. Let it dry overnight.
3. Mix the stain according to the instructions on the product. Get the

painted porch ﬂ oor
Preppy stripes look like a designer ﬂ oor covering on a porch.
1. Prepare the ﬂ oor by sanding any peeling paint. Clean with 
a power washer to remove grime if needed. If the ﬂ oor is bare, 
start with a coat of primer. Tip: Tint the primer the color of your 
lighter paint for extra coverage. 
2. Once the primer has dried, tape oﬀ  equal stripes using 
painter’s tape. Roll on the darker paint color and let dry. For 
durability, choose an exterior-grade paint ﬁ nish.
3. Protect the ﬁ nish with two coats of polyurethane.

checkered ﬂ oor
Although it looks tricky, this checkerboard ﬂ oor is easy to do. Perfect your technique 
on a sample board ﬁ rst.
1. Prep your ﬂ oor. Sand oﬀ  any old varnish, and wash the ﬂ oor with a trisodium 
phosphate (TSP) solution. Buﬀ  with a ﬁ ne-grain sandpaper and wipe down with 
a tack cloth. Prime and paint the ﬂ oor in the lighter of the two colors. We used a 
glossy, oil-base ﬂ oor paint and gave it several days to cure.
2. Determine square size. We used 12-inch squares. Find the center of your 
room and work out, using a laser pointer level to connect your marks making a 
diamond pattern; pencil in lines. Mask oﬀ  alternating squares using painter’s tape. 
3. Mix paint with glaze in a 1:1 ratio. Brush glaze mix onto a square. Drag a 
wood-graining roller (available at crafts or paint stores) through the square. Tip: 
Glaze extends the working time to about an hour, so if you’re not happy with the 
results, just brush on more glaze and start over. Lift oﬀ  the tape before the glaze 
dries completely. Finish with an epoxy sealant that won’t yellow.

linoleum ﬂ oor tiles
You can install click-in-place linoleum ﬂ oor tiles on top of any dry, clean, 
and level subﬂ oor. 
1.  Saw oﬀ  the tongue on the top and left sides of the ﬁ rst tile. Begin 
laying tiles in one corner of the room. Use wedges to maintain a 3⁄8-inch 
gap from the wall. For all ﬁ rst-row tiles, saw oﬀ  the tongue on the wall-
facing side with the linoleum-covered side facing up.
2. Click the next tile in place, lifting it slightly and then pressing down to 
lock. Continue clicking tiles in place along the room’s width. Cut the last 
panel in the row to length.
3. Install the next row by clicking together tiles to form a panel that 
runs the width of the room. Click the entire panel into place with the ﬁ rst 
row. Install additional rows using the same technique. To ﬁ t the ﬁ nal row, 
cut tiles to size and join together with a pry bar. Finish with base, quarter-
round molding, and T-strips at the doorway.
diy tip           
Use an underlayment 
foam with a vapor

ﬂ ooring
For this kitchen’s ﬂ oor, we used three 
diﬀ erent species of laminate ﬂ ooring. 
1. For a new look, choose several 
species in the same ﬂ ooring product 
line by the same manufacturer 
(look for similar production dates to 
ensure the ﬂ ooring ﬁ ts together) and 
mix it up for a mosaic eﬀ ect.
2. Read the manufacturer’s 
instructions and follow any 
guidelines for prepping the subﬂ oor 
and installing the product. Allow 
the ﬂ ooring to acclimate to the 
room’s temperature and humidity 
for 72 hours before beginning. Apply 
underlayment. Some laminate wood 
ﬂ oors come with the underlayment 
attached to the underside of the 
boards.
3. Install according to instructions, 
starting at one end of the room and 
working to the opposite side.

1. Find a steel tool cabinet to ﬁ t your space. Study the cabinet’s 
structure so you are aware of any obstacles before purchasing storage 
solutions to be attached to the cabinet. 
2. Secure various wall-mount storage units, such as rails, paper towel 
holders, and spice holders to the cabinet using screws and bolts. 
3. Cut a piece of butcher block with a table saw to ﬁ t the top of the 
cabinet plus desired overhang. (The weight of the block kept our top in 
place, but you could use screws to secure the top to the cabinet.)

bench seat
For a brasserie-worthy dining settee, pair an upholstered 
headboard with a seat-height bench. 
1. Hang a purchased padded headboard—or make your 
own—a few inches above the bench. Attach to the wall using 
anchor bolts.   
2. Stitch up a comfortable cushion to ﬁ t the bench. Fill with 
a cushy foam ﬁ ller. Pile on a few pillows. 
room divider
Three cabinets ﬁ t together to make a large storage wall.
1. Replace the ﬂ imsy backs of three cabinets with sturdy 
sheets of plywood. Oﬀ set the units to create a wider and 
more stable base, and screw the units together. 
2. Sand, prime, and paint the divider. Varying the colors 
breaks up the size of the piece. If desired, use a focal-point 
color inside the upper cabinets to highlight a collection. 
3. Dress up the backs. The backs of the living room 
cabinets serve as hanging space in the entry for peg racks 
made from cabinet knobs. The back of the center unit 
provides display space for artwork in the living room.

If you can build a box, you can make 
this dramatic custom unit.
1. Search thrif  stores and ﬂ ea 
markets for various baskets, bins, 
bowls, drawers, and even suitcases. 
These will determine the sizes of 
boxes to build. Find pairs or trios that 
are the same or similar in height so 
boxes across one level line up.
2. To build one box, use a table 
saw to cut MDF to your desired size. 
Make each piece the same depth so 
the bookcase sits ﬂ ush against 
the wall.
3. Using a jigsaw, cut a groove or 
dado joint at the top and bottom of 
the inside of each side piece. 
4. Fit the pieces, glue the joints, and 
clamp. When dry, remove the clamp 
and insert screws to strengthen the 
joints. Cover the screws with wood 
putty. Sand, prime, and paint.

Give an earthy nod to midcentury design. The slatted top of this table 
looks streamlined—and it makes cleanup a snap.
1. Cut cedar 2×4-inch boards and 4×4-inch posts to the desired length. 
Lay the boards on a level surface, placing ¼-inch spacers between the 
boards until you reach the desired width.
2. Cut several 2×4s approximately 1 inch shorter than the width of the 
tabletop with a circular saw. Place these 2×4 braces evenly along the 
length of the table. Use decking screws to hold the 2×4s in place on the 
bottom of the tabletop. Remove the spacers.
3. Visit a masonry supply store to buy two hard-ﬁ red, terra-cotta 
chimney ﬂ ues for the table base. They are available in a variety of diameters 
but are typically sold in 24-inch-long segments. Plan to prop up the ﬂ ues 
4–6 inches for comfortable seating height. Set the tabletop on the base.

Hypertufa is an easy material to work with that yields sophisticated results.
1. Gather plastic containers to make pots. Use pairs of slightly diﬀ erent-
size containers to shape your pots. 
2. Mix 2 parts cement to 1 part perlite and 1 part peat moss. Mix dry 
ingredients in a wheelbarrow with a trowel. Add reinforced concrete 
ﬁ bers to give your hypertufa more strength. Add warm water to the 
wheelbarrow and mix until the consistency is like cookie dough.
3. Pack the bot om of a larger plastic container. Nestle a second, smaller 
container into the larger one until the mixture reaches the top of the 
larger container (a). Before the concrete sets, remove from the containers 
and poke a drainage hole (b). 
diy tip           
Store the trough in 
a shady area to cure 
for 30–60 days. The 
hypertufa gets stronger 
every day. Spraying with 
water decreases the 
duration of this process 
to about 30 days.

Grow an easy-care water garden in a galvanized tub.
1. Choose a tub at least 6 inches deep. A galvanized tub works well, but 
any watertight metal bucket, resin tub, ceramic pot, or other container 
will work if it holds water or can be made to hold water with a plastic liner.
2. Place bricks in the bottom of the tub (a). These will act as risers for the 
potted plants. Select from water-loving plants widely available at garden 
centers and nurseries and set between the bricks (b). Top the soil of your 
potted plants with river rock to help hold them in place.
3. Fill the container with water. Reﬁ ll periodically as the water 
evaporates. Prevent mosquitoes by using a tablet for biological control.

A hidden reservoir system beneath the stone orb makes this fountain bubble.
1. Dig a hole deep enough to position a 5-gallon bucket so its rim is about 
½ inch higher than ground level. Level and ﬁ rm the ground. 
2. Place the pump in the bucket with tubing connected. Cut a notch in the 
rim of the bucket to accommodate the pump’s power cord, which will run 
beneath the hog fencing and to the power source. 
3. Cut a 3×3-foot section of hog fencing with a hacksaw. Cut a 3×3-foot 
section of hardware cloth with tin snips. Cut a hole in the center of the cloth 
large enough to run the pump’s tubing through (a). Pull the excess tubing up 
through the panels, leaving a little slack (b).
4. Insert the tubing into the hole in the sphere, pulling it through as you 
lower the sphere onto the panels over the center of the bucket. Place pavers 
around the sphere in a pattern. Add slate chips and gravel.
5. Fill the bucket with water. Cut the tubing ﬂ ush with the top of the sphere, 
and push it down just enough to conceal it. Plug in the pump. The water will 
ﬂ ow over the sphere and drain back through the slate chips into the bucket.

Take the fear out of choosing color 
with these tips. Remember, light affects 
color, so test it in your environment 
before you commit. 
Color conﬁ dence
1   primary colors
Red, blue, and yellow are 
the primary hues. These 
colors are pure; all other 
colors are created from 
primaries.
2   secondary colors
Orange, green, and violet 
are secondary hues, equal 
parts of two primary colors 
combined. Yellow plus blue 
yields the secondary hue 
green.
3   tertiary colors
Mixing a primary color with 
the secondary color next 
to it creates a tertiary color. 
Each blend results in a less 
vivid hue. Yellow and green 
blend to make apple green.
4   neutrals
Think of these “uncolors”— 
beiges, browns, grays, 
black, and white—as the 
supporting players, pairing 
nicely with most hues and 
providing great backdrops. 
Brown and beige range in 
intensity from soft latte to 
deep cocoa. Dark neutrals, 
including rich pewter gray, 
calm other colors and add 
sophistication. White 
enlivens colors, while black 
strengthens and stabilizes.

Primer
Working with 
paint chips
Paint chips are much 
more than little cards of 
color. They organize paint 
collections from a single 
manufacturer, providing a 
look at tints and shades.
Value is the lightness or darkness of 
a color. Sky blue is a light value; cobalt 
is a dark value. Paint chip cards 
typically have light and dark variations 
of one color. Use light yellow in one 
room, for example, and a deeper hue 
from the same paint-chip card in an 
adjoining room. For delineation, pick 
colors separated by at least one chip 
on a card.
Shade Dulling colors with black or 
gray creates shades of that color. 
Shades can be near the top of the 
paint card or at the very bottom.
Intensity This term refers to color 
saturation and specifies clearness or 
brightness. Adding white, black, or a 
complementary color to a pure color 
diminishes its intensity. To ensure the 
same intensity for contrasting colors, 
select hues from the same position on 
paint chip cards, using the same brand.
Tint Closest to white in value, tints 
are also called pastels. You’ll find them 
on the top of a paint card or in a 
separate collection of whites and 
off-whites. Tints can appear almost 
white or stronger in hue.

Paint ﬁ nishes
Flat paint has a nonreflective matte 
finish, which is good for hiding wall 
blemishes. This finish does show 
scuffs and marks, so it’s best in 
low-traffic areas—perfect for a ceiling.
Satin paint shows a slight luster 
with a soft texture. It’s more durable 
than flat and works well in living 
rooms, dining rooms, and bedrooms.
Semigloss paint has a tougher 
skin than satin and a higher luster. It 
stands up well to cleaning and wear. It 
shows imperfections more readily 
than satin or flat paints. This finish 
works well in kitchens and baths and 
on trim. It also is useful in narrow 
hallways where light is at a premium.
Gloss paint is hard, durable, and 
easy to clean. Gloss is excellent for 
kitchen and bath cabinets. Its high 
luster makes imperfections visible. 
Primer
Primers penetrate 
unpainted surfaces, 
create a uniform skin, 
and can also inhibit 
stains. Tint your primer 
if you are painting a 
dark color over light or 
light over dark.
Trim paint
The hard and durable 
enamel finish of trim 
paint stands up to 
constant contact and 
frequent cleaning.
Interior paint
Latex paints are the 
best all-around paints 
for interiors. Low-odor, 
fast-drying latex has a 
water base and is easy 
to clean up.
diy tip           
Test your color before 
committing to gallons of 
a particular shade. Most 
companies sell small 
quantities for testing. 
Paint a piece of white 
poster board and tape the 
board to the wall in the 
room you are planning to 
paint. Observe the color 
throughout the day as the 
light changes. Live with 
the color for a few days, 
moving the board to 
other walls in the room. 
If you still love the color, 
you’re ready to move 
ahead with conﬁ dence.

3-inch brush
Good for outlining walls and 
ceilings and for painting large 
areas, this brush is a workhorse. 
Look for a bare wood handle to 
get the best grip. Hold it 
between your thumb and 
fingers in a relaxed grip.
Angled brush
This is the best tool for painting 
door and window frames, 
moldings, and other areas 
where you need control. Hold 
this brush like a pencil.
Household brush
This brush is ideal for painting 
small areas, furnishings, or 
accent pieces.
Foam brush
Disposable foam brushes come 
in several sizes for smaller paint 
and crafts projects. 
Artist’s brushes
These brushes are perfect for 
detail work and freehand 
designs on small furnishings 
and accent pieces.
Stencil brushes
Stencil brushes are available in a 
variety of sizes. Use large ones 
for overall coverage and small 
ones to fill in details.
Weaver brush
A weaver brush is used to create 
the look of linen or denim.
Specialty painter’s tape is used to mask oﬀ  areas 
before painting. Medium-adhesion tape is often 
used on woodwork that has a nonporous ﬁ nish, 
such as gloss or semigloss paint. It adheres and 
seals well and will stay put for the duration of the 
project. If left on too long, however, it may pull oﬀ  
the ﬁ nish when removed. Low-tack painter’s tape 
for delicate surfaces is used to temporarily mask oﬀ  
stripes, borders, and wall panels. It is often removed 
immediately after painting. Its mild adhesive will not 
pull oﬀ  paint when removed. Both types of tape are 
available in a variety of widths. 
A new hue can brighten a room in hours. 
Get ready to paint with this helpful guide 
to prep, tools, techniques, and cleanup.
Painting tools
Canvas drop cloths
Canvas drop cloths absorb 
liquid and are heavy enough 
to stay put when used on 
the floor or over furnishings. 
A tight weave offers the best 
protection. 
Plastic drop cloths
Plastic drop cloths are 
inexpensive and protect 
surfaces. However, they don’t 
absorb paint, can be slippery, 
and may shift easily.
Lint-free cloths
Use lint-free cloths to remove 
dirt and dust, clean up spills, 
wipe away mistakes, or 
manipulate glaze techniques.
Stir sticks
Grab free sticks when you buy 
paint. Stir paint thoroughly and 
frequently to keep the color 
evenly mixed.

Paint over it!
Not sure you want to 
remove a surface? Here’s 
what you need to know 
before painting over it.
Wallpaper Avoid painting over 
wallpaper whenever possible. Try 
removing the paper. If you 
absolutely can’t get it down, here 
are some steps to follow. First, wash 
the wall with a wet sponge; let dry. 
Use wallpaper paste to secure any 
loose edges or seams. Using a roller 
cover with a 3⁄16- or ¼-inch nap, roll 
on tinted shellac-base stain-
blocking primer; let dry 24 hours. To 
finish, apply two coats of paint.
Paneling Rough up your 
‘70s-style paneling by sanding with 
120-grit sandpaper. Remove 
sanding dust with a damp cloth. Roll 
or brush on bonding primer. When 
the primer is dry, cover the surface 
with two coats of your favorite 
paint color.
Acoustical ceiling tile The 
trick to freshening acoustical ceiling 
tile is popping it out and placing it 
on a flat surface, such as the floor. 
Then spray, brush, or roll on your 
finish. Latex paint works perfectly 
for this project. If the tiles are 
stained or yellowed, apply a stain 
killer before you paint.
Paint your room from the top to 
the bottom. Start with the ceiling, 
then the walls, then windows, 
doors, and other woodwork, 
ﬁ nishing with the baseboards. 
Get started by cutting in a 
2-inch strip around the edges 
of the ceiling. Begin painting in 
a corner. Before painting walls, 
cut in along all the edges, around 
door and window frames, and 
along the baseboards. Apply the 
paint to the walls with a roller.
Brush out any excess paint on 
old newspaper or cardboard.  
Run the brush under warm 
water until the water runs 
clear. Clean the brush, 
working up into the base, with 
dish detergent or trisodium 
phosphate (TSP) solution. Rinse.
Dry the bristles by slapping the 
brush against your palm and 
blot between paper towels. 
Hang in the original cardboard 
holders to store.
Pop the roller cover oﬀ  the 
metal framework. Remove as 
much paint as possible with a 
5-in-1 tool. Run warm water 
over the roller cover until the 
water runs clear. Wash the roller 
using dish detergent, and rinse.
Grasp the roller cover with your 
foreﬁ nger and thumb and slide 
down to squeeze out water 
absorbed into the ﬁ bers.
Hang or stand the roller on end 
to dry, and store.

How to store 
or discard 
paint
Properly stored paint will 
last for years. Try to save it for 
future touch-up jobs. Store the 
paint can upside down. This 
creates a seal around the lid. 
If you do not want the paint, 
donate it to a charity.
If you must dispose of it, 
remove the lid from latex paint 
and air-dry away from children 
and pets. To speed the drying 
process, add cat box litter. 
Discard dry paint with your 
normal trash.
Oil-base paint can be 
discarded with normal trash 
only if the paint has solidiﬁ ed 
in a closed can. The best 
option is to participate in your 
neighborhood’s household 
waste collection program. 
Call your local government 
for details.
Store paint successfully by 
keeping air out of the paint 
container. To accomplish 
this, add a gasket between 
the cover and the can using a 
circle cut from a heavy-duty 
trash bag. Set the plastic circle 
on the can; place the lid on 
top of the plastic. Tap the lid to 
seat it in the well. This keeps air 
from penetrating. Store the can 
upside down in a room free 
from temperature extremes.
Paint walls with 
a “W” motion for

Prepping your room
Plan to devote a full day to the four Ps— 
protecting the ﬂ oors and ﬁ xtures, patching 
holes and gaps, prepping the surface, and 
priming the walls.
Prep & paint 
your trim
1. Wash away dirt and 
residue from your woodwork 
with a TSP solution, then rinse 
the trim several times. Allow 
trim to dry thoroughly.
2. Scrape away splintered 
or chipped wood, then sand 
with ﬁ ne-grit (120- to 180-
grit) paper. Wipe woodwork 
with a tack cloth.
3. Fill holes and dents with 
wood putty. Fill gaps and 
cracks with paintable caulk. 
Smooth the bead by wetting 
your index ﬁ nger and running 
it over the surface. Sand 
repaired areas and wipe down 
using denatured alcohol.
4. Tape around trim (blue 
painter’s tape is best) and 
prime with a stain sealer. 
Allow the primer to dry for 24 
hours, then sand the surface 
once more using 180-grit 
paper; remove sanding dust 
with a tack cloth. 
5. Wipe woodwork with a 
damp cloth before applying 
paint; let dry. Once painted, 
remove the tape. 
When you take a 
break from your 
paint job, wrap your 
brushes and rollers 
in plastic bags, 
squeezing the air 
out, and seal with 
twist-ties or rubber 
bands. To leave them 
overnight, place the 
sealed tools in the 
refrigerator.

Painting your room 
Load your brush
Dip one-third of the brush’s 
bristles into the paint. Lift the 
bristles out of the paint and 
gently tap them (don’t wipe) 
against the rim of the paint 
can. The point is to load the 
brush with paint just short of 
dripping on the way to 
the wall.
Brush in sections
Apply the paint in long 
sections, each about two 
brush-widths wide. Brush 
upward to unload the brush, 
then down to set the paint, 
then up again to remove the 
brush marks. Tip: Wrap the 
ferrule (metal wrap on handle) 
of the brush with painter’s tape 
to catch drips.
Cut in
Use a 3-inch flat brush to 
outline walls and ceilings—a 
technique known as cutting in. 
An angled brush will work 
better in tricky areas that 
require more brush control. 
Leave a loosely brushed edge 
that allows the trimmed area 
to blend in when you paint the 
wall with a roller.
Use a roller
Load a roller by dipping it into 
a tray full of paint and rolling it 
up the tray’s ramp until the 
roller is saturated. Work in 
small sections (4-foot areas), 
rolling paint onto the wall in an 
overlapping W motion. Be sure 
to overlap still-wet areas to 
prevent roller marks.
Clean brushes
Remove excess paint with 
a wide-tooth comb. Rinse the 
brush in warm water or soak 
the brush in a solution of 
½ cup liquid fabric softener to 
1 gallon warm water for about 
15 minutes. Attach your clean 
brush to a spin-dryer tool by 
pushing the handle into the 
stiff spring clips, and spin 
inside a 5-gallon bucket to 
remove excess moisture.
Store brushes 
Cut a rectangle of heavy kraft 
paper or grocery bag—twice 
the length of the ferrule and 
bristles and four times the 
width of the brush. Crease the 
paper vertically down the 
center. Place the brush on the 
paper edge and fold at the 
crease. Roll the brush into the 
paper. Secure it with a rubber 
band. Hang the brush by the 
handle or store it flat.
Clean rollers
Scrape the excess paint out of 
the roller cover with the 
curved side of a five-in-one 
tool. Dump the paint back into 
the paint can. Rinse the cover 
in warm water, scraping with 
the tool until the water runs 
clear. Attach the cover to the 
spin-dryer over the spring 
clips, and spin inside a 
5-gallon bucket. Stand the 
roller cover on its end to dry 
completely before storing.

Now that you’re 
comfortable 
with basic paint 
techniques, ﬁ nd 
other ways to use 
and enjoy your 
newfound painting 
conﬁ dence. A host 
of specialty paints 
and ﬁ nishes can help 
you with any project. 
Using a variety of 
applications, you can 
paint your way to a 
whole new look.
How to
paint
anything
Brick 
Scrub brick with a stiff brush, water, and 
mild detergent, then rinse with vinegar. 
For tough grime, use muriatic acid and 
rinse with 2 tablespoons baking soda per 
gallon of water. Apply masonry sealer 
and then use a long-nap roller to apply 
paint. Use a brush to get paint into the 
grout lines and crevices. If you have 
newly installed brick, wait 30 days before 
painting it.
Glass
Start with a clean, dry surface. If you use 
a pattern, tape it to the outside of clear 
glass. With an artist’s brush, apply a thin 
layer of glass paint. For a more opaque 
finish, apply an additional coat after the 
first is dry. Paint slowly to avoid bubbles. 
Using an artist’s brush, seal the design 
with glass-paint varnish. If you want the 
look of frosted glass, use a varnish with a 
matte finish.
Ceramics & ceramic tile
Wipe the surface clean; let dry. Use a 
paint made for ceramic or porcelain 
surfaces. Allow the paint to dry for 
several days or cure according to the 
manufacturer’s directions. If not using 
ceramic or porcelain paint, sand the 
surface lightly and clean with TSP cleaner 
to remove grease and dirt. When dry, 
apply a bonding or ceramic primer. Let 
the primer dry. Brush on latex paint in a 
gloss or semigloss finish. 
Laminate 
Clean the surface with a cotton rag, 
water, and mild detergent such as dish 
soap. Let dry, then sand with 180-grit or 
similar fine sandpaper. Wipe with a tack 
cloth. Apply a special bonding primer 
suitable for laminate surfaces to increase 
the paint’s adhesion. Let dry according to 
the manufacturer’s directions. Roll or 
spray a top coat that works with the 
primer applied. Consider testing 
products on a hidden area first.
Floorcloth 
Base-coat your floorcloth canvas if 
desired. After the base coat dries, use a 
straightedge to guide your stencil 
placement. Apply your design in a 
contrasting color with a stencil brush, 
cleaning the stencil before moving it to a 
new section. When the paint is dry, seal 
and protect the design with clear 
polyurethane.

Primer
Wood furniture
If the surface is already painted or 
varnished, remove dirt or wax buildup 
with a household cleaner and rinse. Sand 
rough areas and wipe away dust with a 
tack cloth. Apply two coats of stain-
blocking primer and allow it to dry 
between coats. Roll or brush on two 
coats of latex paint in the direction of the 
wood grain. Use a brush to finish the 
surface with smooth strokes. 
Drywall 
Dust walls and wash them with TSP. 
Scrape off loose paint and fill any holes 
with surfacing compound. For new 
drywall, apply a wallboard sealer. For 
existing drywall, use a stain-blocking 
primer to help hide water stains. Apply 
two coats of latex paint, letting dry 
between coats.
Plastic 
Sand the surface lightly to increase 
adhesion. Wash with TSP. Be careful not 
to touch the clean surface, leaving oil 
behind. Apply spray primer and then 
spray paint, both designed for plastic. 
Apply multiple thin coats according to 
the manufacturer’s directions and let dry 
between coats. 
Concrete 
Scrub with TSP, then a bleach and water 
solution. Degrease oily spots using a 
concrete degreaser, and repair cracks 
with a concrete filler. Etch the surface 
with a 10 percent solution of muriatic 
acid and water. Apply a hydrodynamic 
sealer and two or three coats of paint 
designed for concrete surfaces. 
Metal
Clean the surface with a stiff wire brush 
to remove flaking paint or rust. Wipe with 
a mixture of bleach and water using a 
damp cloth and let dry. Prime with metal 
primer and let dry, or use a paint with 
rust inhibitors. Apply several thin coats of 
paint. If using spray paint, hold the can 
10–12 inches from the surface as you 
spray. Shake the can during the 
application to keep the color mixed. 
Spray lightly to avoid paint runs.
Fabric 
Tape preshrunk fabric to plastic-treated 
cardboard. (Place the cardboard inside 
a pillow cover so paint doesn’t soak 
through.) Use fabric paint or an acrylic 
paint mixed with textile medium. Apply 
the paint in several thin coats to work it 
into the fibers. Heat-set if required. Your 
piece can be laundered with mild 
detergent after 10–14 days.

1. Cut a front and back piece 
of fabric to the desired pillow 
size, adding 1 inch to the 
length and width for the seam 
allowance. Place the fabric 
right sides together and pin. 
Mark an opening for stuﬃ  ng 
along the edge. 
2. Sew around the pinned 
fabric using a 1⁄2-inch seam 
allowance, stitching corners 
on an angle as shown. 
Backstitch where you begin 
and end, leaving a 4-inch 
opening. When ﬁ nished, trim 
each corner at a diagonal. 
3. Reach into the open seam 
and turn the fabric right side 
out; press. Insert batting or 
pillow form. Hand-stitch the 
opening closed.

discounted throws from 
your favorite retailer. Flat 
sheets work well, too. 
Each makes an excellent 
alternative to pricey

The beauty of 
repurposing tablecloths,

the edges are ﬁ nished. 
If you’re working with 
a raw piece of fabric, 
ﬁ nish the edges yourself 
using iron-on hem tape

Backstitch
Used to create a solid line, the 
backstitch is a key stitch. Working right 
to left, bring the needle up through the 
back of the project and create a forward 
stitch. For subsequent stitches, insert 
the needle a stitch length ahead on the 
backside of your fabric and bring the 
needle up to complete the stitch. 
Running stitch
It doesn’t get any easier than this. To 
make this basic stitch, perfect for 
creating loose outlines, pass a needle in 
and out of the project. Make the top 
stitches slightly longer than the 
underside stitches, and keep the stitch 
length uniform. 
French knot 
Add detail to projects—such as flower 
centers—with a French knot. Bring your 
needle through the back of your project 
to the front. Wrap the thread around the 
needle three or four times, keeping a 
tight grip on the thread. Push the needle 
down through the fabric just next to 
where it came out, holding the thread 
tight. Pull the needle through the knot 
to the back of the fabric.
Lazy daisy stitch 
To create quick leaves or petals, try a 
lazy daisy stitch. Insert the needle on 
the back of the project (knot the end of 
your thread first), then pull the needle to 
the front. Insert the needle next to the 
first stitch, looping the thread under the 
needle. Pull the needle through to 
create a loop. Tie down the outside of 
the chain with a quick stitch, then bring 
the needle back up in position for the 
next stitch.
Stem stitch
For outlines with extra detail, make a 
stem stitch. Working the stitch left to 
right, bring the needle up through the 
back of the project on the pattern 
outline. Hold the thread toward you and 
make a short slanting stitch to the right. 
Continue stitching to complete your 
pattern.  
Long and short stitch
Perfect for filling in a design, a long and 
short stitch combo creates a modern 
look. For the first row, use a backstitch 
to create alternate long and short 
stitches, following the shape of your 
outline. Keep working the following 
rows of stitches, keeping them the same 
length for a uniform look or alternating 
lengths for free-form style. 
Embroidery stitch sampler
With your magic wand (or needle) in hand, you can 
accomplish all sorts of projects using these six 
simple stitches. 
Winding 
a bobbin
Though every sewing 
machine is diﬀ erent, most of 
them wind the bobbin in a 
similar way. Here's how to do 
it. (Refer to your machine’s 
instructions as needed.)
1. Place your spool of thread 
on the spool pin.
2. String the thread from 
the spool pin through the 
hook at the back of the 
sewing machine (also called 
the thread guide).
3. Wrap the thread once 
around the tension knob at 
the top of your machine.
4. Pull the end of the thread 
through the bobbin and set 
the bobbin on the bobbin 
pin. Leave 2 inches of thread 
hanging over.
5. Push the bobbin pin over 
to the side. If you need to, 
disengage the sewing needle 
so it doesn’t move as you 
press on the machine foot to 
wind your thread.
6.  Allow the thread to wind 
around the bobbin until it 
reaches maximum capacity. 
This is usually indicated by a 
line on the bobbin.
7. Lif  the bobbin oﬀ  the pin 
and cut oﬀ  any excess thread.
diy tip           
To create paper pulp, 
place small pieces of 
torn newspaper in a pan 
and cover with boiling 
water. Let it sit for an 
hour, then strain. Press 
between your ﬁ ngers 
to create a mushy 
paper pulp. When 
combined with a glue 
mixture, paper pulp 
can be pressed into 
any number of molds, 
where it dries into a 
hard material you can 
shape or embellish. See

How to make piping
Give your projects dressmaker details with decorative piping, 
following these four steps.
1. Cut fabric on the bias (a line diagonal to the grain of the fabric) 
into 1-inch-wide strips with scissors or a rotary cutter (a). Tip: 
Fabric strips cut on the bias are easier to wrap around the cording 
and around corners of your ﬁ nished project. But you’ll need to 
budget for more yardage. Piping cord is available by the yard and in 
various sizes at fabrics stores. Look in the home decorating section.
2. With right sides together and using a 1⁄2-inch seam 
allowance, sew the short sides of the piping together, sewing at an 
angle as shown (b).
3. Unfold the pieces, press, and trim excess fabric (c). 
4. Center piping cord on the wrong side of the fabric strip, fold 
over, and sew close to the edge of the piping using the zipper foot (d).
How to make felted ﬂ owers
Create blooms that never fade by getting crafty with wool roving. 
Use this loose wool to create other felted products, too, such as 
balls and beads.
.1. Peel oﬀ  a 1-inch-thick section of roving (available at yarn 
shops and online at outbackﬁ bers.com and amazon.com) from 
the bundle and gently twist the wool (a).
2. Tie the twisted wool into a pretzel shape—the looser, the 
better (b).
3. Feed the ends of the wool through the center of the knot to 
create a loose ﬂ ower (c, d). Sew loose stitches at the back of the 
ﬂ ower to secure the ends.

A good set of tools lays the foundation 
for success in all your endeavors. 
This collection of tools will see you 
through most projects.
Tools
Tape measure Look for a 
locking blade, belt clip, and 
sturdy case. Small measures are 
light and easy to carry; larger 
models are easier to read and 
have longer blades.
Carpenter’s level Available 
in many lengths, these tools 
have two sets of bubble 
vials—one set to show level, 
another to show plumb.  
Carpenter’s square You’ll 
need this tool to make long 
90-degree layout lines—up to 
24 inches long. Markings 
embossed in metal last longer 
than painted markings.
Speed square This 
multitalented tool, a speed 
square serves as a level, square, 
miter square, protractor, line 
scribbler, and ruler.
Stud finder This electronic 
device quickly locates structural 
members hidden behind 
wallboard. Look for one that 
can sense electrical wiring.
Carpenter’s pencil Thick, 
soft lead makes easy-to-see 
marks when scribing lines for 
cuts. A rectangular shape keeps 
it from rolling off the table.
Combination square 
Combining a level, square, 
scribing tool, and rule, this 
handy device allows you to level 
small items, check for 
squareness, and scribe lines.
Bar clamp Unlike screw-
operated C-clamps, bar clamps 
allow you to close the jaws with 
one hand, leaving your other 
hand free to align the pieces 
you’re clamping. Use for 
applying pressure to glued 
joints and for holding items 
while cutting, drilling, or 
fastening. 
Tongue-and-groove 
pliers Adjustable jaws allow 
you to grip large-diameter items 
securely. Long handles further 
amplify leverage. Grab this tool 
for taking apart plumbing to 
unclog drains and for holding 
large items while working.
Linesman’s pliers These 
robust pliers were designed to 
grip, crimp, shape, and cut 
electrical wire. But as any 
homeowner knows, they’re 
useful for lots of other tasks, 
from pulling small finishing nails 
to bending and cutting coat-
hanger wire for art.
Long-nose pliers Designed 
to work their way into confines 
that your fingers can’t, these 
pliers are still hefty enough to 
provide a lot of gripping force. 
Choose a pair with a hinge that 
operates without binding and 
fine-tooth jaws.
Locking pliers These 
incredibly handy devices are a 
combination of pliers and 
clamp that can grip and hold 
items. Use them when you 
need extraordinary gripping 
force, to clamp small items 
together (while drilling holes, 
for example), or as temporary 
replacements for levers or 
knobs on faucets, door handles, 
or sporting equipment. Locking 
pliers such as these models are 
available in a variety of sizes and 
jaw styles.

Claw hammer These are 
available in a range of weights; 
16 ounces is standard and good 
for general work. Heavier 
20-ounce framing hammers 
speed the driving of large nails. 
Choose a curved claw, such as 
the one this model has, for 
easiest nail pulling.
Tack hammer A hammer 
with an elongated head, a tack 
hammer is designed to drive 
small steel upholstery tacks into 
furniture frames. One head is 
magnetic and holds the tack for 
the first blow.
Center punch The point on 
the head of this punch is 
designed to make an 
indentation in wood, metal, or 
plastic to guide a drill bit to a 
precise location.
Brad nails Use these for jobs 
that need small-head finishing 
nails. Brad nails such as these 
can be used with the 
appropriate staple/nail gun. 
Centering punch A cousin 
of the center punch, this tool 
automatically finds the center of 
a mounting hole, then marks it 
with a pointed plunger you 
strike with a hammer. 
Staple gun An evolution of 
the hammer, this staple/nail gun 
uses a spring-loaded striker to 
drive staples.
Backsaw and miter box 
For precision work—cutting 
wood and some plastics 
precisely square or at accurate 
angles—choose a backsaw and 
miter box. Essential for cutting 
moldings and picture frames to 
ensure tight corner joints, a 
miter box is an inexpensive 
alternative to a cabinetmaker’s 
power cutoff saw.
Handsaw Almost eclipsed by 
a plethora of power saws, the 
humble handsaw still has many 
advantages: It’s inexpensive, 
lightweight, compact, quiet, 
and relatively safe; can trim 
wood in close quarters; and can 
be used without a cumbersome 
power cord. 
Hacksaw A hacksaw cuts 
metal, plastic, and other 
materials. The tensioned blade 
is replaceable and available with 
fine teeth for smooth cuts in 
hard materials and coarser teeth 
for faster cuts in softer 
materials.
Utility knife With its 
sharp-pointed, razor-honed, 
replaceable blades, a utility knife 
is designed to cut almost 
anything: cardboard, 
pasteboard, poster board, 
insulation, foam board, 
packaging and duct tape, crafts 
materials, plastic sheeting, vinyl 
floor tiles, and more. 
Safety glasses Choose 
safety glasses that are light and 
offer wraparound protection. 
Bonus: They look more like 
designer sunglasses than the 
goggles of just a few years ago. 
Dust mask Wear one while 
sawing, sanding, scraping, or 
drilling to avoid inhaling dust 
that can lead to health 
problems. 
Ear protectors Essential to 
prevent hearing loss when using 
loud tools such as power saws, 
you’ll find these protectors will 
hush the buzz of sanders and 
powered lawn tools, too.
Work gloves These protect 
your hands from nicks, cuts, 
and abrasions and give you a 
firm, comfortable, no-slip grip. 
Choose a style with stretchy 
spandex and adjustable 
closures for a safe, snug fit.

Ratcheting screwdriver 
This single compact tool 
replaces a whole drawer of 
old-fashioned screwdrivers. 
Various types and sizes of bits 
store inside the handle, where 
you can’t lose them, and slip 
into the business end of the tool 
to drive slotted, Phillips-head, 
square-drive, and other types of 
fasteners.  
Socket wrench Sold in sets 
consisting of a ratcheting 
wrench handle and a collection 
of sockets sized to fit various 
hex nuts and bolts, a socket 
wrench is the fast way to tighten 
and loosen fasteners on 
everything from furniture to 
cars, offering a secure grip. 
Adjustable wrenches With 
a jaw that adjusts to various size 
bolts, this wrench serves the 
same function as a set of 
nonadjustable, open-ended 
wrenches. While the largest 
adjustable wrench can grip a 
small nut, the large head and 
long handle can render this tool 
useless in tight quarters. 
Wood glue This is suitable 
for all kinds of woodworking; 
choose a formula that is strong, 
quick-setting, easy to use, and 
weatherproof, allowing you to 
create projects that will hold up 
to outdoor exposure. Wood 
glue, when clamped or 
screwed, forms a bond that’s 
almost invisible and often 
stronger than the wood it joins. 
Rivet gun This tool lets you 
join pieces of metal too thin to 
screw together, and also works 
when you can’t reach the back 
of your project to fasten a nut 
on a bolt. 
Cordless drill-driver If you 
don’t own one yet, buying one 
will transform your DIY 
experience. If you have an old 
model, try a new one. Drill-
drivers allow you to drill holes 
and drive screws and other 
fasteners quickly and precisely, 
taking the tedium out of 
everything from building 
ready-to-assemble furniture to 
removing switchplates before 
painting a room. This model 
features light, powerful 
lithium-ion batteries and a 
fast-charging power pack that 
keeps the juice flowing. Look 
for at least 12-volt batteries, an 
adjustable multiple-position 
clutch, and a minimum of two 
speeds. A variety of drill bits will 
have you ready for any job.
Circular saw For large 
projects, a circular saw seems 
indispensable. Designed for 
fast, smooth, accurate cuts in 
lumber and sheet materials 
such as plywood, some circular 
saws can cut metal and other 
materials with the appropriate 
blade. Look for a powerful 
motor, easy-to-read depth and 
angle scales, and well-placed 
handles for good balance. 
Saber saw The most versatile 
of power saws can cut wood, 
plastic, metal, and sheet goods 
such as plywood and 
particleboard. It can make 
straight, angle, and bevel cuts, 
but excels at cutting curves—
something a circular saw can’t 
do. For this reason, a saber saw 
is a good first choice of power 
saw. A handy feature: a blower 
that keeps the area free from 
sawdust as you work. 
Random-orbit sander 
There’s no need to own two 
sanders. A random-orbit sander 
works almost as fast as a belt 
sander but is easier to control 
and produces a finer surface 
than old-fashioned orbital 
sanders.

Cutting 
know-how
Clean break When you 
near the end of a cut with a 
handsaw, ﬁ rmly grasp the scrap 
end and lightly press it upward 
to keep it from snapping and 
splintering on the last stroke.
Power up When using a power 
saw, allow it to reach full 
operating speed, then slowly 
push the blade into the wood.
Score! Use a utility knife and 
a straightedge to score a cut 
line on sheet goods such as 
plywood, then make the ﬁ nal 
cut with your saw.
Facedown Mark and cut 
material with the good side 
down to minimize splintering.
Cut the fat To cut thick stock, 
draw the cut line on all four 
faces, then make two cuts 
from opposite sides.
Safety ﬁ rst
Before beginning any 
project, review the plans 
and instructions carefully, 
and if any doubts or 
questions remain, consult 
local experts or authorities. 
Because local codes and 
regulations vary greatly, 
check with local authorities 
to ensure your project 
is in compliance. Always 
read and observe all safety 
precautions provided by 
any tool or equipment 
manufacturer and follow 
all recommended safety 
procedures.

How to build 
a headboard
If you have a weekend, you can 
make an upholstered headboard 
like the one shown on page 156. 
1. Measure the desired height 
for your headboard on two doors. 
Our headboard is 66 inches tall. 
Mark cut lines (a).
2. Saw at the lines to size (b). 
3. Line up the sawed-oﬀ  doors, 
noting the location of interior 
wood framing (c).   
4. Drive six to eight screws 
through furring strips into 
the wood framing along the 
bottom edges. Repeat along the 
headboard’s top edge to link the 
two pieces (d).  
5. Cut fabric and batting 
10–14 inches longer than the 
headboard’s width. Spray the 
upper portion of the headboard 
with adhesive (the lower portion 
will not be upholstered; your bed 
will hide the wood). Working with 
a partner, gently lay the ﬁ rst layer 
of batting in place (e). Spray on 
more adhesive and lay on the 
second layer of batting. Press 
into position. Lay the fabric and 
straighten.
6. Working with a partner, 
smooth the fabric and stretch 
tightly. With a staple gun, tack the 
fabric and batting in a few spots 
on the back (f). 
7. Flip over the headboard and 
staple the fabric and batting every 
3 inches. At the corners, remove 
the excess batting. Fold the fabric 
as if wrapping a package and 
staple in place (g). 
8. Nail a frame of decorative 
trim (h) on the top and two sides 
(bottom edge does not need trim). 
Countersink nails, ﬁ ll with wood 
ﬁ ller, and touch up with paint.

diy tip           
When you’re drilling 
pilot holes for nails, do 
what carpenters do. Use 
one of the nails as a drill 
bit. Clip oﬀ  the head 
with diagonal cutters or 
a nail puller and tighten 
the nail in the drill. The 
hole you drill will hold 
the nail snugly, and the 
wood won’t split as you 
drive the nail.

1. Test wires for breaks in 
continuity. Attach a tester clip 
to the stripped end of the 
neutral (ribbed) wire and touch 
the probe to the wide prong of 
the plug at the other end (a). 
Repeat for the narrow prong 
and the hot (smooth) wire. 
2. Replace the defective cord 
by cutting the old cord. Strip 
1 inch oﬀ  the ends of both 
old and new cord wires. Form 
hooks on all four wire ends 
and splice the old to the new. 
Wrap tightly and smoothly 
with electrician’s tape (b). 
3. Feed the new cord into 
the base of the lamp while 
pulling the old cord through 
the top (c). Keep pulling 
until the new cord emerges. 
Separate the cords and discard 
the old one. Attach the new 
cord to the socket. 
How to 
rewire a 
lamp
Use a rewire kit designed for 
your type of lamp. Always 
unplug the lamp and remove 
the bulb before you start.
Make a box
1. Use a table saw to cut medium-
density ﬁ berboard to your desired 
box size. Opposite sides should 
measure equally. Make each piece 
the same depth so the sides are ﬂ ush. 
2. Using a jigsaw, cut a groove or 
dado joint into each vertical side for a 
better ﬁ t (see illustration, above).
3. Fit the sides together, ﬁ ll joints 
with wood glue, and clamp. When 
dry, remove the clamp, and insert 
screws along the length of the box. 
Cover screws with wood putty. Sand 
to remove excess; prime and paint.
You can get the look of the boxy bookshelf shown 
on page 197 sans major power tools. Use purchased 
modular storage cubes or shelves and wood boxes 
found at discount craft stores. Unify the disparate pieces 
with paint (sand and prime ﬁ rst), and connect with wood 
screws. Look for pieces of the same depth.
Working with pipes
Putting together projects with 
pipes requires pipe ﬁ ttings 
designed for industrial use 
(90-degree side outlet tees, 
ﬂ anges, and elbows). These 
are metal joints that let a pipe 
turn a corner, connect to a 
wall or ﬂ oor, or fasten to other 
unthreaded pipes. You can use 
Kee Klamp ﬁ ttings from Kee 
Industrial Products (800/851-
5181), which distributes 
products nationwide. You 
could also use ﬁ ttings from 
another manufacturer; just be 
sure they ﬁ t the pipes you’re 
using before you buy.
Don’t let the rough surface 
of your sawhorses mar your 
projects. For protection, cut 
a 1x4 to the length of your 
sawhorses. Cover the board 
with scrap carpet, and tack 
to the top of the sawhorse.

1. Make the necessary 
preparations—lay your 
subﬂ oor, measure, mark, cut, 
and assemble your border 
row. Then you’re ready to 
install your ﬂ ooring. Most 
laminate ﬁ ts together by 
tongue-and-groove (a). 
2. Snap planks together. 
Tilt one plank, pushing the 
tongue into the groove of 
the plank next to it (b). Lower 
the plank. Use this method to 
lay additional planks. Stagger 
joints with each row.
3. Use a tapping block to 
close any gaps as needed (c).

Walls & ﬂ oors
diy tip           
Having trouble 
visualizing what your 
ﬂ oor or wall pattern 
will look like? Use 
graph paper to plot 
out the design. If 
you’re looking for 
inspiration, stop by 
your tile store and 
ask for a planning 
brochure and design 
catalog to help you 
create decorative 
patterns and 
borders. Many tile 
manufacturers oﬀ er 
free brochures ﬁ lled 
with great ideas.
Buying 
wallpaper
The majority of 
patterned wallpapers 
fall into two categories: 
straight match and drop 
match. Determine which 
type of paper you have 
before you start to cut.
Straight match indicates 
that pattern elements 
of the same design are 
directly opposite each 
other on the left and 
right edges of the strip.
Drop-match patterns 
begin near the edge 
of one sheet and are 
completed on the next 
sheet with a design that 
repeats diagonally. Drop-
match paper will cost 
you more because you’ll 
use more to get the 
patterns to match up. 
Flooring 
considerations
Here are three oft-forgotten ﬂ oor-shopping 
considerations: 
1. Sheet, plank, or tile? The type of ﬂ ooring 
product is important if you’re doing it yourself. But 
it’s also a question of aesthetics. Determine where—
or if—you want to see seams or grout lines.
2. How do you clean it? There is no such thing as a 
maintenance-free ﬂ oor. Carpet requires vacuuming 
and periodic deep cleaning. Wood ﬂ oors need 
dusting, waxing, and occasional reﬁ nishing. Even 
hard-wearing ceramic tiles must be grout-sealed 
and mopped.
3. How does it feel? Make sure you know how 
your ﬂ ooring choices feel—and sound—underfoot. 
Moisture-hardy tile in the bath, for example, might 
be too cold for some bare feet.

How to 
install cork 
ﬂ ooring
Add natural beauty underfoot 
with a cork tile ﬂ oor. 
1. Apply contact adhesive 
with a roller (a) to a 
clean ﬂ oor according to 
manufacturer directions, 
allowing it to dry for 30 
minutes or until it is tacky to 
the touch.
2. Set tiles on the adhesive 
(b). The working time is 
limited, so make adjustments 
quickly. Tap tiles into place 
by setting a board over the 
tile and tapping with a mallet. 
Use a utility knife to trim any 
excess. Allow tiles to set for 
24 hours before using.

Removing wallpaper
Nonpeelable wallpaper requires the use of remover 
solutions to penetrate the paper and soften the adhesive. 
Give remover solutions a chance to work. 
1. Find a loose edge and begin to strip the wallpaper. 
Vinyls often peel away easily, but you may need the 
assistance of a wallboard knife. 
2. If the wallpaper won’t strip by hand, perforate the 
surface of the wallpaper. This will allow the remover 
solution to enter and soften the adhesive.
3. Cover the ﬂ oor with layers of newspaper or a drop 
cloth. Add wallpaper remover to hot water in a bucket as 
directed by the manufacturer. 
4. Use a sprayer, paint roller, or sponge to apply 
the remover solution. Let the solution soak into the 
wallpaper according to the manufacturer’s directions. 
5. Once you’ve loosened the wallpaper, peel it away 
with a 6-inch broad knife. Be careful not to damage the 
plaster or wallboard. Remove all of the backing paper.
6. Rinse the residue from the wall with remover 
solution. Rinse with clear water and let the walls dry.

Before you begin, shut oﬀ  the water, 
then run the ﬁ xture until it empties. 
Disconnect the lines using two 
wrenches or pliers, one to hold the 
stop valve while the other loosens the 
supply lines. 
Use a basin wrench to remove nuts 
holding the ﬁ xture in place. Loosen the 
sprayer hose guide if there is one. 
Lift the old ﬁ xture out of its mount. 
Apply plumber’s putty around the 
bottom of the ﬁ xture. Square it to sink.  
Install a sprayer support. Tighten the 
nut by hand and ﬁ nish with a basin 
wrench. Thread the sprayer and hose 
through the support and center ﬁ xture.
Make as many connections as possible 
before installing the faucet and sprayer 
to minimize time spent under the sink.
Thread ﬂ exible lines through the hole, 
then set the ﬁ xture into place. Press the 
sprayer hose and faucet ﬁ rmly into 
the plumber’s putty. 
Have someone hold the ﬁ xture steady 
and straight as you attach it to the sink.
Attach and tighten the supply lines. 
Turn on the water and check for leaks.

Replacing a faucet
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions, and you can 
replace a leaky or outdated faucet in no time.
Remember:  
Always check 
manufacturer’s 
instructions 
before 
beginning 
installation.
1. Decide the size of your 
vanity. Choose the sink 
and ﬁ xtures. Take those 
measurements to your local 
stone company and choose a 
limestone countertop. Tip: Ask 
to pick through the remnants. 
You can ﬁ nd some great deals!
2. Provide measurements 
to the stone fabricator to cut 
and polish the slab edges and 
holes for the sink and faucet.
3. Cut chrome-coated brass 
tubing with a chop saw. Attach 
all the ball ﬁ ttings. Attach two 
front legs to the underside of 
the counter with ﬂ oor ﬂ anges.  
The other two ﬂ oor ﬂ anges 
attach cross supports to 
the wall.
4. Cut a wood cleat about 
4 inches smaller than the 
length of the limestone top 
to support the back of the 
counter. Attach the cleat to 
the wall. 
5. At ach the undermount 
sink with adhesive. Install 
ﬁ xtures. Run a bead of 
adhesive on the cleat and the 
front ﬂ anges. Place the stone 
top on the base and allow it to 
set. Install the faucet and drain. 
Caulk the seam between the 
back of the vanity and the wall.

How to tile a backsplash
The backsplash can be the jewel of a kitchen or bath. Use this strip 
of wall  to make a design statement that wows. 
1. Spread a layer of mastic on the wall using a trowel (a). Check 
the manufacturer’s instructions for the necessary thickness. 
Comb lines across the mastic using the trowel’s notched edges.  
2. Position the tile on the mastic, making sure it’s level. If you 
need to cut tile, use a tile cutter or wet saw. Press the tile into 
the mastic (b). Use spacers to keep the tile uniform as you work 
across the surface. Let dry overnight. Tip: Work in small sections. 
Mastic dries in about 15 minutes. 
3. Apply grout using a ﬂ oat. Spread the grout across the tile and 
work into the spaces between tiles using the edge of the ﬂ oat (c).
3. Wash oﬀ  excess grout with a damp sponge (d). Rinse 
and wipe down until the grit is gone. Seal the grout for extra 
protection according to the manufacturer’s instructions (usually 
several days after the grout dries).

You’ll dig these projects and tips that make 
your outdoor spaces as comfortable and 
beautiful as any room in the house. 
Outdoor living
Reﬁ nish 
your deck
The elements can take a toll on 
your deck.  Give yours a second 
chance with a new ﬁ nish.
1. You have several prep 
options: Scrub with a stiﬀ  
bristle brush using TSP or 
commercial cleaner; remove 
old stain with a chemical 
stripper; or rent a pressure 
washer and clean with 
TSP solution.  
2. Let your deck dry before 
applying the recommended 
stain. This is a good time to 
replace bad boards and nails.
3. Apply your ﬁ nish. Your 
application options depend on 
the stain type and size of your 
deck. You could use a paint 
roller. Stain only a few boards 
at a time to reduce overlap 
marks. You also could use a 
sprayer, which creates even 
coverage quickly. Or you 
could apply a gel stain with a 
pad applicator.
4. When applying ﬁ nish to 
hard-to-reach places, such 
as end grain, seams, and gaps 
between boards, use a brush 
to work the ﬁ nish into the 
wood. Depending on your 
climate, sun exposure, traﬃ  c, 
and protective ﬁ nish, your 
ﬁ nish may last one or two 
years. Ask your paint retailer 
for guidance.
Handy 
helpers
Precast metal 
anchor spikes are 
one way to set posts. 
Drive the spike into 
the ground, then 
install the post in the 
anchor. The posts in 
these anchor spikes 
don’t provide as 
much support as 
posts anchored in the 
ground with 
concrete, but they’re 
a lot easier to install.
A posthole should be about 4 inches wider than the post. In an area with 
no frost, dig holes so that half of the exposed height of the posts is below 
ground. In areas with frost, the holes should extend 6 inches below the frost 
line. Add 4 inches to the depths of holes for tamped gravel. For best results, 
widen the bottom of end, corner, and gate postholes by 4 inches and pour 
a 6-inch concrete footing. Line posts can be set in soil; they don’t require a 
concrete footing unless your soil is loose or sandy.
diy tip           
When shopping for 
edging, keep in mind 
the traits of diﬀ erent 
materials. Plastic 
edging is ﬂ exible and 
ideal for curves. Metal 
is rigid and best for 
straight edges on 
level ground. Wood 
timbers are good 
around raised beds. 
Brick is versatile. You 
have a choice of 
colors and a range of 
applications. Precast 
concrete is ideal for 
straight edges on 
level ground.

Primer
In a heap or large bin, create alternating 
layers (4–8 inches deep) of green 
materials and brown materials.
Let sit. The green materials will 
naturally create nitrogen, and the 
brown materials will create carbon.
Add water regularly so the contents 
remain damp, but never wet. This 
creates the heat the compost needs.
With a shovel or compost fork, stir the 
pile once a week when the compost 
reaches a temperature between 130°F 
and 150°F.
Allow the compost to sit, stirring for 
one to three months or until the pile no 
longer gives oﬀ  heat and becomes dry 
and crumbly. Then start feeding your 
blooms and veggies with this natural 
fertilizer. 
Cool compost
Instead of kicking your trash to the 
curb, take it out to your backyard and 
create your own compost pile.

1. At ach cable to 
transformer. Lay cables and 
arrange ﬁ xtures. With the ﬁ rst 
ﬁ xture in your run at least 10 
feet from the transformer, 
determine the placement 
of each light. For even 
illumination, leave a few feet 
(a) between ﬁ xtures.
2. Dig a 3- to 6-inch trench 
(b), leaving a small amount of 
slack at each light juncture to 
connect the ﬁ xture. Leave a 
small amount of cable sticking 
out of the soil at each ﬁ xture 
location.
3. Assemble ﬁ xtures and 
attach each light to a cable 
at each juncture. Most lights 
attach to a cable with a two-
part connector that pierces 
and locks into place (c). 
Turn on the transformer to 
make sure the connection is 
good. Attach each ﬁ xture to 
a ground stake. Bury cables 
under the soil.

Facts of 
ﬂ agstone
Here’s what you need to know 
before setting a path or patio with 
ﬂ agstone. 
Shop smart. Choose ﬂ agstones 
that are at least ¾ inch thick; 
thinner pieces crack more readily. 
Purchase stones of a fairly uniform 
thickness so they will be easier to 
lay evenly. Buy about 10 percent 
more than you think you’ll need to 
allow for waste and breakage.
Pay for delivery. Spare your back 
and your car. Have the company 
deliver the stone as close to 
the job site as possible so you 
don’t have to cart rock from the 
driveway to the backyard.
Keep your cool. Setting stone 
is not easy. The same uneven 
surfaces that make natural stone 
so appealing require lots of 
shimming and packing to create 
a stable surface. Sometimes 
you need to just walk away and 
come back later, with a diﬀ erent 
perspective. Patience and 
teamwork pay in the end. 
YOU’LL NEED: 
_Transformer
_Waterproof outlet 
  cover
_Low-voltage cable
_Low-voltage 
  landscape light 
  fixtures and bulbs
_Shovel
_Phillips and flathead 
  screwdrivers
Mount the transformer at least 1 foot above 
ground and within 1 foot of the GFCI. Apply a 
waterproof cover to outlet for ex tra protection.

Lay a paver  
path or patio
Add structure to your landscape 
with a stone path or patio.
1. Plot the layout of your path or 
patio. (Lay a row or two of pavers 
to determine a conﬁ guration that 
won’t require much cutting.) Mark 
the perimeter with string tied to 
stakes driven into the ground (a). 
Mark directly on the dirt with chalk 
or spray paint.
2. Dig a trough about 6 inches 
deep (or deep enough to 
accommodate 2 inches of gravel, 
2 inches of sand, and the height 
of your pavers) (b). Cover the area 
with landscape fabric and ﬁ ll with 
2 inches of gravel. 
3. Install plastic edging around 
the border of your path or patio. 
Fasten with metal spikes (c).  
4. Fill the trench with coarse 
bedding sand, leaving enough 
depth for the pavers, and rake 
smooth. Dampen the sand, and 
level it by dragging a 2×6 across 
it (d). Add sand to low spots and 
remove sand in high areas. Tip: 
Slightly slope a patio away from 
your house for drainage (¼ inch 
per foot). Smooth the surface with 
a tamper (e). You can ﬁ nd one at a 
rental center. 
5. Lay the ﬁ rst few pavers 
snuggly against the edging, 
starting at a corner. Use a rubber 
mallet to tap the pavers into place 
(f). Every few feet, use a level to 
check that the pavers are set at 
the same height. Make sure paver 
edges and joints are aligned.
6. Use a masonry saw (available 
at rental centers) if you need to 
make cuts (g). Always wear safety 
glasses, earplugs, and a dust mask 
when operating a masonry saw.
7. Cover the area with ﬁ ne 
mason’s sand when you’ve 
ﬁ nished laying your path or patio. 
Sweep the sand into the joints (h). 
Sweep oﬀ  any excess sand and 
dampen the area.

Paint door hardware
Outdated hardware can be freshened up with a coat of paint. 
Follow these steps to get it right. 
1. Remove the doorknob and lock mechanism from the 
door. Tip: Take photos as you go and label the images—“inside 
dead bolt” and “outdoor knob”—to aid in reassembly. Clean 
the hardware with steel wool (a), then rub the surfaces with 
sandpaper (b). Remove dust with a tack cloth.
2. Insert a small piece of folded painter’s tape into the keyhole 
(c) so paint doesn’t get in the lock mechanism. Place the 
hardware in foam so you can easily paint all sides.
3. Spray hardware with metallic primer according to the 
directions on the can. After the primer has thoroughly dried, 
spray the hardware with metallic paint (d). Let dry.
4. Reinstall hardware.
Paint an exterior door
Your front door says a lot about who you are. If you don’t like 
what’s it’s saying, change the conversation with paint.
1. Remove the door and place on sawhorses outside or in a 
well-ventilated area. Tip: Allowing your door to dry between 
coats may mean letting it dry overnight. Screw a piece of 
cut-to-size plywood into existing hardware holes to cover 
the door opening if necessary. 
2. Remove the hardware and hinges (a). Cover any glass 
accents or windows with painter’s tape (b). Clean the door by 
scrubbing the surface with a wet sponge (c), then lightly sand 
the surface.
3. Apply primer to the door using a foam roller (d). Use a 
foam brush to prime any raised or depressed panels. Let dry. 
Using the same technique, apply paint, starting at the center 
and ending with the sides. Let dry. Apply a second coat for a 
ﬂ awless ﬁ nish. Hang door and reattach hardware.
