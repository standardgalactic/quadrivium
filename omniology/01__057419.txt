1. 
OVERVIEW 
Unless otherwise stated, these Software Technical Support Policies apply to technical support for all 
Oracle software product lines.   
"You" and "your" refers to the individual or entity that has ordered technical support from Oracle or an 
Oracle-authorized distributor. 
To receive technical support as provided by Oracle Support Services (“OSS”) as described in these 
Oracle Software Technical Support Policies, all programs must be properly licensed. 
Technical support is provided for issues (including problems you create) that are demonstrable in the 
currently supported release(s) of an Oracle licensed program, running unaltered, and on a certified 
hardware, database and operating system configuration, as specified in your order or program 
documentation.   
Except as otherwise specified in this section, product release and supported platforms information for 
all Oracle programs, other than Nimbula and MICROS Systems programs (US Cruise only), is available 
through Oracle’s web-based customer support systems as described in the Web-Based Customer 
Support Systems section below. Product release and supported platforms information for Nimbula 
programs will be provided to you in writing.  
References to the Technical Support Policies in former Oracle, or vendors acquired by Oracle, 
agreements may vary (e.g., Software Support Services Terms and Conditions, Maintenance Services 
Policy, Standard Maintenance Program, product support policy, Support Services policies, Support 
Maintenance Agreement, Maintenance and Technical Support Agreement, Maintenance and Support 
Schedule 2.0, and Licensee Support Services Policy). 
These Technical Support Policies are subject to change at Oracle's discretion; however, Oracle policy 
changes will not result in a material reduction in the level of the services provided for supported 
programs during the support period (defined below) for which fees for technical support have been 
paid. 
To view a comparison of these Oracle Software Technical Support Policies and the previous version of 
the Oracle Software Technical Support Policies, please refer to the attached Statement of Changes 
(PDF).
 
Use of Services 
Services may not be delivered to or accessed by or on behalf of individuals or entities in Venezuela, the 
Russian Federation, and Belarus, including, without limitation, the Government of Venezuela, the 
Government of the Russian Federation, and the Government of Belarus, nor may the Services or any 
output from the Services be used for the benefit of any such individuals or entities. 
 
 
2. 
SUPPORT TERMS 
Technical Support Fees 
Technical support fees are due and payable annually in advance of a support period, unless otherwise 
stated in the relevant order or payment plan, financing or leasing agreement with Oracle or an Oracle 
affiliate (“payment plan”).  Your payment or commitment to pay is required to process your technical 

 
Oracle Software Technical Support Policies: 05-May-2023  
 
 Page 5 of 36  
 
 
support order with Oracle (e.g., purchase order, actual payment, or other approved method of 
payment).  An invoice will be issued only upon receipt of your commitment to pay, and will be sent to a 
single billing address that you designate. Failure to submit payment will result in the termination of 
technical support services. Technical support will be provided pursuant to the terms of the order under 
which it is acquired; however, technical support fees due under a payment plan are due and payable in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of such payment plan.   
Support Period   
Technical support is effective upon the effective date of your order unless stated otherwise in your 
order. If your order was placed through the Oracle Store, the effective date is the date your order was 
accepted by Oracle.  Unless otherwise stated in the order, Oracle technical support terms, including 
pricing, reflect a 12 month support period (the "support period").  Once placed, your order for technical 
support services is non-cancelable and the sums paid non-refundable, except as provided in the 
relevant order. Oracle is not obligated to provide technical support beyond the end of the support 
period.  
License Set 
A license set consists of (i) all of your licenses of a program, including any options* (e.g., Database 
Enterprise Edition and Enterprise Edition Options; Purchasing and Purchasing Options), Data 
Enterprise Management programs* (e.g., Database Enterprise Edition and Diagnostics Pack), or self-
service module* (e.g., Human Resources and Self-Service Human Resources) licensed for such 
programs, (ii) all of your licenses of a program that share the same source code**,  or (iii) for Crystal 
Ball programs, the same licenses of a program contained on a single order,  (iv) for  Java Embedded 
Binary programs, all of the distributed units of the program(s) embedded in each unique Java 
Application Product  pursuant to the Java Binary License and Redistribution Agreement (“BLRA”)  
between you and Oracle, (v) if you are distributing Java Restricted Use Binary programs or if you are 
distributing Java Embedded Binary programs under the Oracle Java Platform Integrator program  
(“OJPI”), all of the end user’s licenses of the program(s) embedded or included in the Java Application 
Product pursuant to the BLRA or (vi) a license of the same program regardless of it being purchased as 
a perpetual license or as a license subscription.  Development and demonstration licenses available 
through the Oracle Partner Network or the Oracle Technology Network are not included in the 
definition of a license set.   
*As specified on Oracle’s price list. 
**Programs that share the same source code are:  
 
Database Enterprise Edition, Database Standard Edition, Database Standard Edition 
One, Oracle Database Standard Edition 2 and Personal Edition 
 
Internet Application Server Enterprise Edition, Internet Application Server Standard 
Edition, WebLogic Server Enterprise Edition, WebLogic Server Standard Edition, 
WebLogic Suite, and Web Tier 
 
Oracle FLEXCUBE Core Banking programs 
 
Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking for Retail programs 
 
Oracle FLEXCUBE Universal Banking for Corporate programs 
 
Oracle FLEXCUBE Lending & Leasing programs 
 
Oracle Daybreak programs 
 
Oracle Banking programs 

 
Oracle Software Technical Support Policies: 05-May-2023  
 
 Page 6 of 36  
 
 
If you are an Oracle partner and provide first line support to an end user (e.g., Embedded Software 
License (“ESL”), Application Specific Full Use (“ASFU”), or any other Oracle authorized provision of first 
line support), a license set consists of all of the end user’s licenses of the program(s) embedded or 
included in the Application Package pursuant to the ESL Distribution Agreement, ASFU Distribution 
Agreement, or other distribution agreement between you and Oracle.  If the end user also has Full Use 
licenses supported directly by you, then those Full Use licenses must also be supported at the same 
level as the ASFU or ESL licenses.   
If Oracle is providing first line support for all of an end user’s ASFU and Full Use licenses, then both the 
ASFU and Full Use licenses must be supported at the same level. However, if Oracle is providing first 
line support for an end user’s Full Use licenses and you are providing first line support for the ASFU 
and/or ESL licenses, then the licenses would not be considered part of the same license set.   
Matching Service Levels 
When acquiring technical support, all licenses in any given license set must be supported under the 
same technical support service level (e.g., Software Update License & Support, Oracle Communications 
Network Premier Support, or unsupported).  If you add Extended Support, you still must maintain 
Software Update License & Support for the entire license set; subject to availability, you must acquire 
Extended Support for all licenses of a particular version release of a program if you acquire Extended 
Support for any license in such version release. You may not support a subset of licenses within a 
license set; the license set must be reduced by terminating any unsupported licenses.  You will be 
required to document license terminations via a termination letter.  
Reinstatement of Oracle Technical Support 
If technical support lapses or was not originally purchased with a program license, a reinstatement fee 
will be assessed.  The reinstatement fee is computed as follows: (a) if technical support lapsed, then the 
reinstatement fee is 150% of the last annual technical support fee you paid for the relevant program; 
(b) if you never acquired technical support for the relevant programs, then the reinstatement fee is 
150% of the net technical support fee that would have been charged if support had been ordered 
originally for the relevant program per Oracle’s Support pricing policies in effect at the time of 
reinstatement. The reinstatement fee in (a) shall be prorated from the date technical support is ordered 
back to the date technical support lapsed.  The reinstatement fee in (b) shall be prorated back to the 
original program license order date. 
In addition to the reinstatement fee described above, you must pay the technical support fee for the 
support period.  This technical support fee is computed as follows: (i) if technical support lapsed, then 
the technical support fee for a twelve month support period shall be the last annual technical support 
fee you paid for the relevant program; (ii) if you never acquired technical support for the relevant 
program, then the annual technical support fee shall be the fee that would have been charged if support 
had been ordered originally for the relevant program per Oracle’s Support pricing policies in effect at 
the time of reinstatement.  Renewal adjustments may be applied to the annual support fee described 
in (i) and (ii) above.   
If you previously acquired technical support from an Oracle-authorized distributor and are now 
acquiring technical support directly from Oracle, an uplift may be added to the reinstatement fee and 
your technical support fee. If support is not reinstated for the entire license set or if support for a subset 
of licenses from an order is reinstated, then the “License Set”, “Matching Service Levels”, and “Pricing 
following Reduction of Licenses or Support Level” policies will apply.     
 

 
Oracle Software Technical Support Policies: 05-May-2023  
 
 Page 7 of 36  
 
 
Pricing Following Reduction of Licenses or Support Level 
Pricing for support is based upon the level of support and the volume of licenses for which support is 
ordered.  In the event that a subset of licenses on a single order is terminated or if the level of support 
is reduced, support for the remaining licenses on that license order will be priced at Oracle's list price 
for support in effect at the time of termination or reduction minus the applicable standard discount.  
Such support price will not exceed the previous support fees paid, plus any applicable country annual 
adjustments, for both the remaining licenses and the licenses being terminated or unsupported, and 
will not be reduced below the previous support fees paid for the licenses continuing to be supported.  
If the license order from which licenses are being terminated established a price hold for additional 
licenses, support for all of the licenses ordered pursuant to the price hold will be priced at Oracle's list 
price for support in effect at the time of reduction minus the applicable standard discount. 
Custom Application Bundles 
Technical support may not be discontinued for a single program module within a custom application 
bundle. 
Unsupported Programs 
Customers with unsupported programs are not entitled to download, or receive updates, maintenance 
releases, patches, telephone assistance, or any other technical support services for unsupported 
programs.  CD packs or programs purchased or downloaded for trial use, use with other supported 
programs, or purchased or downloaded as replacement media may not be used to update any 
unsupported programs. 
Technical Contacts 
Your technical contacts are the sole liaisons between you and OSS for technical support services.  Your 
technical contacts must have, at a minimum, initial basic product training and, as needed, supplemental 
training appropriate for specific role or implementation phase, specialized product usage, and/or 
migration. Your technical contacts must be knowledgeable about the Oracle supported programs and 
your Oracle environment in order to help resolve system issues and to assist Oracle in analyzing and 
resolving service requests. When submitting a service request, your technical contact must have a 
baseline understanding of the problem you are encountering and an ability to reproduce the problem 
in order to assist Oracle in diagnosing and triaging the problem. To avoid interruptions in support 
services, you must notify OSS whenever technical contact responsibilities are transferred to another 
individual.  
You may designate one primary and four backup individuals ("technical contact") per license set, to 
serve as liaisons with OSS.  With each USD$250,000 in net support fees per license set, you have the 
option to designate an additional two primary and four backup technical contacts. Your primary 
technical contact shall be responsible for (i) overseeing your service request activity, and (ii) developing 
and deploying troubleshooting processes within your organization. The backup technical contacts shall 
be responsible for resolving user issues. You may be charged a fee to designate additional technical 
contacts.  
Oracle may review service requests logged by your technical contacts, and may recommend specific 
training to help avoid service requests that would be prevented by such training.

Program Updates 
Update means a subsequent release of the program which Oracle generally makes available for 
program licenses to its supported customers at no additional license fee, other than shipping charges 
if applicable, provided you have ordered a technical support offering that includes software updates 
for such licenses for the relevant time period. Updates do not include any release, option or future 
program that Oracle licenses separately. Updates are provided when available (as determined by 
Oracle) and may not include all versions previously available for a program acquired by Oracle. Oracle 
is under no obligation to develop any future programs or functionality.  Any updates made available 
will be delivered to you, or made available to you for download. If delivered, you will receive one update 
copy for each supported operating system for which your program licenses were ordered.  You shall be 
responsible for copying, downloading and installing the updates. 
Right to Desupport 
It may become necessary as a part of Oracle's product lifecycle to desupport certain program releases 
(including any embedded third-party programs for which support has been retired by the manufacturer 
or vendor of such programs for which, in Oracle’s good faith determination, it is no longer practicable 
for Oracle to support) and, therefore, Oracle reserves that right. However, program releases that are 
expressly identified within Oracle’s Lifetime Support policy will be governed by the terms of the Lifetime 
Support Policy. Desupport information is subject to change.   
First and Second Line Support 
You are required to establish and maintain the organization and processes to provide “First Line 
Support” for the supported programs directly to your users. First Line Support shall include but not be 
limited to (i) a direct response to users with respect to inquiries concerning the performance, 
functionality or operation of the supported programs, (ii) a direct response to users with respect to 
problems or issues with the supported programs, (iii) a diagnosis of problems or issues of the supported 
programs, and (iv) a resolution of problems or issues of the supported programs. 
If after reasonable commercial efforts you are unable to diagnose or resolve problems or issues for the 
supported programs, you may contact Oracle for “Second Line Support”. You shall use commercially 
reasonable efforts to provide Oracle with the necessary access (e.g., access to repository files, log files, 
or database extracts) required to provide Second Line Support.   
Second Line Support shall consist of (i) a diagnosis of problems or issues of the supported programs 
and (ii) reasonable commercial efforts to resolve reported and verifiable errors in supported programs 
so that such supported programs perform in all material respects as described in the associated 
documentation. 
Oracle may review service requests logged by your technical contacts, and may recommend specific 
organization and process changes to assist you with the above recommended standard practices. 
Third Party Vendor-Specific Support Terms 
You must remain on a supported environment – including applications and platforms – to receive 
technical support.  If a vendor retires support for its product, you may be required to upgrade to a 
current certified and supported product, application, hardware platform, framework, database, and/or 
operating system configuration to continue receiving technical support services from Oracle.

Technical Support for Development, Demonstration and End User Licenses 
Technical support for Development and/or Demonstration licenses is provided through your 
membership in the Oracle PartnerNetwork. Before you may provide technical support for a program 
you have licensed to an end user you must, in addition to the technical support you may receive for 
Development and/or Demonstration licenses, acquire technical support for such program from Oracle 
and continuously maintain it for as long as you provide support to the end user.  
3. 
LIFETIME SUPPORT 
Lifetime Support consists of the following service levels: 
 
Premier Support (also referred to as, and will be documented on your order as, “Software Update 
License & Support” or “Oracle Communications Network Software Premier Support”) 
 
Extended Support (if offered) 
 
Sustaining Support 
A description of the services available under Premier Support, Extended Support and Sustaining 
Support is included in the Oracle Technical Support Levels section below. 
Premier Support for any given program release will be available for five years from the date that release 
of the Oracle program becomes generally available, as documented in the Lifetime Support coverage 
documents, except as noted below.  At the end of the Premier Support period, either Extended Support 
or Sustaining Support will be available. Extended Support, if offered, may be available for an additional 
three years for specific program releases.  An Extended Support fee applies for each support period, 
which is in addition to the standard Premier Support fee, except as noted below. 
Alternatively, technical support may be extended with Sustaining Support, which will be available for as 
long as you continuously maintain and pay the annual fees for technical support for your Oracle 
program licenses.

TOOLS USED TO PERFORM TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES 
Oracle may make available collaboration tools (such as tools that enable Oracle, with your consent, to 
access your computer system (e.g., Oracle Web Conferencing)) and software tools (such as tools to 
assist in the collection and transmission of configuration data (e.g., Oracle Configuration Manager)) to 
assist with issue resolution.  The tools are licensed under the Oracle Support Portal Terms of Use, and 
may be subject to additional terms provided with the tools. Some of the tools are designed to collect 
information concerning the configuration of your computer environment (“tools data”) and not access, 
collect or store any personally identifiable information (except for technical support contact 
information) or business data files residing in your computer environment.  By using the tools, you 
consent to the transmission of your tools data to Oracle for the purposes of providing reactive and 
proactive technical support services. In addition, the tools data may be used by Oracle to assist you in 
managing your Oracle product portfolio, for license and services compliance and to help Oracle 
improve upon product and service offerings.  

 
Oracle Software Technical Support Policies: 05-May-2023  
 
 Page 33 of 36  
 
 
Some of the tools may be designed to connect automatically or on a periodic basis and you may not 
receive a separate notice upon connection. You are responsible for maintaining the telecom gateway 
through which the tools communicate tools data to Oracle. Use of the tools is voluntary; however, 
refusal to use the tools may impede Oracle’s ability to provide technical support services to you.  
Further details about some of the current tools Oracle uses to provide technical support services, the 
data collected, and how the data is used, are described in the Global Customer Support Security 
Practices and on My Oracle Support. You may also contact your Oracle sales representative or call your 
local Customer Support office for more details regarding the tools and availability. 
If Oracle expressly provides in the tools documentation, technical support policies, an order, or readme 
that a tool is provided under separate license terms ("Separate Terms") then the Separate Terms shall 
govern your access and use of the tool.  Embedded third party software, or third party software, 
licensed under Separate Terms (for example Mozilla and LGPL) may be required to access or run the 
tools per the tools documentation or readme. Your rights to use a tool or software licensed under 
Separate Terms shall not be restricted or modified in any way by your agreement with Oracle. 
8. 
GLOBAL CUSTOMER SUPPORT DATA PROTECTION PRACTICES  
To the extent you provide personal information to Oracle as part of Oracle’s provision of technical 
support services, Oracle will comply with the following: 
 
Oracle’s Services Privacy Policy, available at https://www.oracle.com/legal/privacy/services-
privacy-policy.html; and  
 
the applicable version of the Oracle Data Processing Agreement for Oracle Services, available at 
https://www.oracle.com/corporate/contracts/cloud-services/contracts.html#data-
processing 
In providing technical support services, Oracle will also adhere to the applicable administrative, 
physical, technical and other safeguards described in Oracle’s Global Customer Support Security 
Practices (PDF). The Global Customer Support Security Practices are subject to change at Oracle’s 
discretion. However, Oracle will not materially reduce the level of security specified in the Global 
Customer Support Security Practices during the services period of these technical support services. You 
are advised to review these Global Customer Support Security Practices from time to time. To view 
changes that have been made, please refer to the Statement of Changes (PDF). 
Please note that the technical support services are not designed to accommodate special security or 
privacy controls that may be required to store or process certain types of sensitive data. Please ensure 
that you do not submit any sensitive data, such as protected health information or payment card data, 
which requires security and privacy controls greater than or different from those specified in the Global 
Customer Support Security Practices (PDF). Information on how you can remove sensitive data from 
your submission is available in My Oracle Support, Doc ID 1227943.1. 
Notwithstanding the restriction above, if you would like to submit personal information subject to 
Applicable European Data Protection Law (as such term is defined in the Oracle Data Processing 
Agreement for Oracle Services) or protected health information (“PHI”) subject to the United States 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) to Oracle as part of receiving technical 
support services, you must: 
 
For PHI, execute a HIPAA business associate agreement (as applicable) with Oracle that 
specifically references and covers your technical support services;

personal information subject to Applicable European Data Protection Law (also may be 
designated as “EEA Personal Data” in My Oracle Support) or PHI. 
9. 
SEVERITY DEFINITIONS 
Service requests for supported Oracle programs may be submitted by you online through Oracle’s web-
based customer support systems or by telephone. The service request severity level is selected by you 
and Oracle and should be based on the severity definitions specified below.   
Severity 1 (Critical Outage) 
Your production use of the supported programs is stopped or so severely impacted that you cannot 
reasonably continue work.  You experience a complete loss of service.  The operation is mission critical 
to the business and the situation is an emergency.  A Severity 1 service request has one or more of the 
following characteristics: 
 
Data corrupted 
 
A critical documented function is not available 
 
System hangs indefinitely, causing unacceptable or indefinite delays for resources or response 
 
System crashes, and crashes repeatedly after restart attempts 
Reasonable efforts will be made to respond to Severity 1 service requests within one hour. For response 
efforts associated with Oracle Communications Network Software Premier Support and Oracle 
Communications Network Software Support & Sustaining Support, please see the Oracle 
Communications Network Premier & Sustaining Support and Oracle Communications Network 
Software Support & Sustaining Support sections above.   
Except as otherwise specified, Oracle provides 24 hour support for Severity 1 service requests for 
supported programs (OSS will work 24x7 until the issue is resolved) when you remain actively engaged 
with OSS working toward resolution of your Severity 1 service request. You must provide OSS with a 
contact during this 24x7 period, either on site or by phone, to assist with data gathering, testing, and 
applying fixes. You are requested to propose this severity classification with great care, so that valid 
Severity 1 situations obtain the necessary resource allocation from Oracle. 
Severity 2 (Significant Impairment) 
You experience a severe loss of service. Important features are unavailable with no acceptable 
workaround; however, operations can continue in a restricted fashion.  
 
Severity 3 (Technical Issue) 
You experience a minor loss of service. The impact is an inconvenience, which may require a 
workaround to restore functionality.
