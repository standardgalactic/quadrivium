Introduction

hatever role you play in your company, finding out more about busi-
ness development gives you a broader perspective on how to make 
the firm grow. The purpose of business development is to drive growth, or 
whatever form of expansion is important to you right now.
Absolutely everybody in the company can make a contribution to growth, 
and this book not only gives you a grounding in business development – it 
also shows how people in different areas of the business can do their bit. As 
the saying goes, the sum of the parts is greater than the whole.
People commonly move into business development from other parts of the 
company, and leaders often have to manage business development and all its 
component parts. This book helps you do that.
The book is intended for small to medium-sized companies that offer services 
to other businesses – so-called business-to-business (B2B). Such firms are as 
diverse as lawyers and architects, corporate event planners or video special-
ists, technology implementers, branding and marketing companies. I keep 
the content general enough to be applicable to a wide range of people and 
organizations. Product companies will also find this book useful, along with 
anyone who wants to be expert in business development.
About This Book
After 20 years working in business development, you’d expect that I’ve 
learned a thing or two. One fact I discovered is that people are confused 
about what business development is. In this book I set out to dispel that con-
fusion and provide a model for business development that anyone can use.
Another thing I found out is that companies go through spurts of growth, 
interspersed with periods of flat revenue, or even backsliding. For smaller 
companies, say those with less than $10 million in revenue, this variation can 
result in periods of severe peril. Therefore, I want to provide ideas as to how 
you can mitigate that danger through robust business development.
Also, when company growth stalls, what you did yesterday to get new busi-
ness probably isn’t going to work for your next phase of expansion. That 
pattern keeps recurring and you’ll find that some things from the book are a

Business Development For Dummies 
no-brainer to do today, whereas others may be more relevant in two to three 
years’ time. Yes, here is the book that keeps on giving.
I include lots of good advice for executives who need to plan for growth, but 
aren’t sure what to prioritize or how to manage people with different capa-
bilities to their own. In the early years, you can’t afford top leaders for every 
part of your organization – you have to wear a lot of hats until you have the 
money to start handing those areas over to others, who may often be new 
employees.
When I started my career in the US, I was in charge of delivery and also 
tasked with getting more business. I learned from my then CEO how to be 
effective in selling, contract negotiation and customer management. I later 
began to dig into and understand marketing and how to make partnerships 
pay off. In other words, it all had to be ‘painted on’ – it didn’t come naturally.
Even today, I know the areas that I’m really good at and the ones best left to 
someone else. I’ve come to realize that nothing’s wrong with me – the best 
leaders know their weaknesses and get help. So if you’re used to going it 
alone, this book provides you with a pathway to surrounding yourself with 
the right people to take you where you want to be.
I wouldn’t be able to share my experience authentically unless I ’fess up that 
I’ve experienced failure as well as success. Every great business leader I’ve 
ever known has done the same and has the capacity to handle failure and 
learn from it. I’m really excited that you want to join their ranks.
I attended a seminar recently. The leader said, ‘This isn’t television. I’m actu-
ally talking to you and I require you to respond.’ Similarly, I don’t see this 
book as a leisurely bedtime read – it’s an interactive experience. Study, think, 
write. Keep a pad and pen handy throughout. You’re about to reinvent how 
you do business.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume that you’re an ambitious business owner or leader who wants 
to grow your company, but for whom business development holds some 
mystery. Whether you’re directly involved in strategy, marketing, selling, 
customer management or working with partners, you need to understand 
the strategies and tactics for making your business grow. Marketing folks, 
salespeople and customer managers will find this book useful as well, if they 
want an overview of business development to improve their own practices or 
better understand other disciplines.

revenue growth has slowed down or even halted. If so, this book gives you 
a fresh look at how to push forward to the next stage in your company’s 
history.
I assume that you don’t want a sit-back-and-relax book but are willing to 
commit to active reading, participate in ‘try this’ experiments, use tools to 
help you make plans and develop ways to measure your results. I give you 
strategic direction and on-the-ground tactical tools and advice and assume 
that you’re going to take what’s useful and apply it in your own organization. I

Business Development For Dummies 
Beyond the Book
This book is chock-a-block with business-development guidance, tools, 
tips and tactics to make you successful. You can find additional tools at

articles at www.dummies.com/extras/businessdevelopment. You

businessdevelopment.
Where to Go from Here
If you’re new to business development, I suggest that you read this book 
cover to cover from Chapter 1. If you ever thought that business develop-
ment was just sales, you’ll change your mind by the time you’re done.
Even experienced business developers probably want to read Chapter 1, 
which defines what business development is and ensures that the rest of the 
book makes sense. One of the most common issues with business develop-
ment is that company leaders are overly centered on their own services and 
how great they are, but not necessarily on what the customer cares about. 
Part I turns that on its head, and so is an important foundation for the rest of 
the book.
For Parts II through VII, you can focus on what’s most important to you. If 
you want to get to grips with something specific quickly, take a look at the 
contents pages and dive right in. I provide plenty of cross-references to help 
you find what you need to supplement any chapter.
I encourage you to share the book with your co-workers. Business develop-
ment takes teamwork, and so if you decide to adopt any of the practices in 
this book, pass it on to others who need to be involved. I make clear where 
that involvement is important and how everyone can contribute.
As you read this book and work with some of its ideas, I hope that you rec-
reate your view of business development. Above all, being in business is a 
game that you play to win; how you do business development determines 
whether you win the game.
Digest this book in your own time and I wish you well with your business 
growth.

f you ask ten people what they think business development is, you prob-
ably get ten different answers. Chances are that even your own view of 
business development isn’t completely aligned with others in your organiza-
tion, unless you’ve taken special and unusual steps to make it so.
Whether you’re a business owner, involved in business development or just 
interested in discovering more, you probably inherited your view of business 
development from your business experiences, gleaned it from Google, cre-
ated it yourself or perhaps used a mix of all these influences.
In this chapter, I set the scene for the whole book, providing a clear defini-
tion of business development, which involves strategy (see the chapters in 
Part II), marketing (Part III), sales (Part IV), customer management (Part V) 
and partnerships (Part VI) – and I set out why business development matters. 
I also describe the central role of your customers and tackle the problem of 
becoming overwhelmed, discussing how and why you need to find time for 
business development in your company.
Answering the Question: So What Is 
Business Development Anyway?
Here’s the $64,000 question: What is business development? Is it something 
to do with sales? For sure. Is it related to business growth? It had better be! 
Does is have anything to do with your business strategy? Probably.

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
	
When you set out to create something, say, a new company, a growth plan or 
a new service, nothing says how it ought to be: in other words, your ‘some-
thing’ is what you create it to be. You may have noticed, however, that in busi-
ness what gets created soon becomes the norm, the accepted way, the way it 
has to be. So that when you try to change something, someone always says, 
‘but we’ve always done it this way’. Boy, don’t some people take themselves 
seriously!
When this happens, you can find yourself forgetting that you created it, what-
ever it is, and that therefore you can recreate it. Successful businesses take 
recreation seriously – recreation is built into their DNA. Recreating is how they 
keep their offer (the service they bring to the marketplace and something I 
discuss in detail in Chapter 5) fresh, how they assimilate new ways to market 
themselves, how they reduce their sales cycles and how they find great part-
ners to help them grow their businesses.
Check out Chapter 2 for lots more on the importance of business development.
Recognizing that business  
is a serious business
	
If you’re thinking that business is a serious matter, I agree with you. Professional 
football is a serious game (and a big money business). It has a purpose (get 
that ball over the touchline – or in the goal if you’re thinking soccer), it has 
rules and it’s clear what winning looks like (and the winners receive prizes!). 
Think about business like that and it becomes fun; well, some of the time.
Given the different ideas people hold about business development, having a 
definition is useful. Here’s mine: 
	
Business development is the discipline required to achieve growth through the 
acquisition of profitable net new customers and expansion of existing customers.
Clearly business development is concerned with growth and most companies 
achieve growth by getting new customers. Even if you grow by acquisition, 
you’re still, at the root of it, acquiring new customers (though note that, 
unless they’re profitable to you, you really don’t want them). You also have 
existing customers and many firms neglect the opportunity for growth that 
lies within those existing (or historical) customers.
Discipline is required to acquire, keep and grow customers. Discipline has 
two meanings here:

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
9
 Chapter 1: Introducing Business Development for Services Firms
	
✓	Discipline is the serious study of business development as a busi-
ness competence. I’m frequently amazed how many people think that 
they can do business development when they’ve never studied it for a 
moment. If you think about your offer and the knowledge and experience 
it takes to do what you do for your customers, you probably don’t take 
that lightly. So start thinking of business development the same way. You 
have to study it, become an expert and use the discipline.
	
✓	Discipline is the rigor of doing business development every day. When 
small firms have plenty of business, they neglect business development, 
and when they’re running out of business they panic and start scurrying 
around for new opportunities. This approach is disastrous. Getting new 
business takes time. If you’re not looking ahead to where your revenue is 
going to come from in three or six months’ time, you’re facing the spec-
tre of horrible revenue swings, which stress your company, your cash 
flow and your co-workers/employees.
Business development gives you a disciplined approach to creating your 
offer, taking it to the market, acquiring customers, developing them to 
enhance your success and partnering with others to grow still further.
The discipline helps you smooth out the bumps in the road. You know – the 
bumps that caused you to pick up this book, whatever they were.
Understanding how business development 
differs from selling
I need to dispel a myth: a lot of people equate business development with 
selling, but in fact selling is just one of its functions, not the whole thing.
Selling is only part of business development
Sales is the art and science of presenting a solution to a prospective cus-
tomer’s need and getting to a transaction, where the customer ‘buys’ your 
solution.
	
By contrast, business development is much broader. To develop a business, 
you have to create solutions to the problems or pains that are sufficiently 
common in the marketplace for you to build a viable business. Then you have 
to figure out how to take that offer to the marketplace and generate results.
Business development encompasses:
	
✓	Your offer: Creating the solution you have or the reason your business 
exists. Move on over to Chapter 5 for more on your offer.
www.ebook777.com

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
10
Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
	
✓	Marketing: Making the market aware of your offer. Chapters 8 to 12 
contain all you need to know about marketing in the context of business 
development.
	
✓	Selling: Acquiring new customers. Chapters 13, 14 and 15 are your 
guides here.
	
✓	Customer management: Delivering your solution so that you retain, 
expand and leverage your customer base. Check out Chapters 16, 17 and 
18 for more on customer relationships.
	
✓	Partnerships: Joining with other firms to expand your opportunities. 
Chapters 19 and 20 are your friends here.
	
✓	Feedback: Using opinions to improve your offer (in other words, quality 
assurance). Chapters 3, 7 and 17 cover feedback from customers, from 
your staff and from the delivery department, respectively.
You can see that business development is cyclical – a feedback loop, with the 
potential to improve, recreate and enhance your performance. The power 
of business development lies within that cyclical nature (more on that in 
Chapters 3 and 4).
	
People always buy because they have a need. Even a ‘want’ such as ‘I want 
a diamond ring for my 25th anniversary’ is a need. I need to show myself, 
and everyone else, that my husband still loves me. I need to look good to the 
neighbors (‘did you see that ring he bought her!’). Businesses experience 
needs as problems or pains that need to be solved. So the purpose of selling is 
the same whatever the context – fulfilling customer needs.
Businesses that think of business development as only sales often have big 
gaps in their business development cycle that lose them money. Closing 
those gaps is one way you can boost your results – often dramatically.
Getting those spectacular results takes more than one person. It takes a vil-
lage or, in a small company, a few key people pretending to be a village (also 
known as wearing multiple hats). Growth is dependent on creating the vision 
for business development and then dealing with the reality (something I 
tackle in the later section ‘Taking stock of where you are’).
Problems that result from getting things wrong
	
When companies confuse sales with the wider practice of business develop-
ment, they often end up taking the wrong approach to growth.
Imagine that your firm has reached a certain size and as the owner you’re 
totally stressed trying to keep up with everything you have to do. You’ve 
exhausted your own network for getting customers, and sales are slowing 
down.

11
 Chapter 1: Introducing Business Development for Services Firms
What do you do? Hire a salesperson, of course! Customer acquisition becomes 
the salesperson’s responsibility and you can get on with all the other stuff. The 
problem is that salespeople are born to sell and selling is a specific discipline 
related to taking prospective customers from a twinkle in the eye to signing a 
contract.
Nonetheless, you hire a salesperson, give her a title like ‘Director of Business 
Development’ and sit back and wait for the sales to roll in.
On her first day, your salesperson shows up for work. At 10:00 a.m. you meet 
with her to get her started. You talk about what the company does, you talk 
about your customers and you ask about who she’s planning to sign up first. 
She interrupts you with three questions:
‘What’s in my bag (what offers am I taking to the market)? Where’s my col-
lateral (where’s my marketing stuff)? Where are my leads?’
You look a bit uncomfortable:
‘Umm. Aren’t you supposed to do all that, Ms Director of Business 
Development?’
‘No, I’m a salesperson. I sell. Period.’
Ooops!
	
I’m painting an extreme picture here, but it happens; I see it all the time. The 
salesperson is left on her own. She sighs, pulls out her metaphorical rolodex, 
makes calls and tries to close business. Six months later, she’s let go, not 
because she’s no good (although that’s often the conclusion) but because the 
company didn’t understand that selling is just one part of business develop-
ment. The firm sent the salesperson up the creek without a paddle.
The sad thing is that some business owners repeat this sorry cycle three or 
even four times before coming to the (wrong) conclusion that salespeople are 
worthless and that the firm better go back to how it was doing things before. 
Like a popped balloon, bang goes any chance of business growth.
	
Business development is a wide-ranging game – if you only focus on the next 
sale, you’re missing the point.
Breaking business development  
into bite-sized chunks
If, as I define it in the earlier ‘Recognizing that business is a serious business’ 
section, business development is all about achieving growth, acquiring net 
new customers and expanding existing customers, how do you go about that? 
What do you have to do in practical terms?

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
	
One place to look for answers is at companies like yours that have grown to 
$10 million (£6.3 million), $20 million (£12.6 million) in revenue or beyond. 
What do they do to get there? Well, they focus on key things that ensure 
growth and success:
	
✓	They keep an eye on the marketplace, what’s happening in it and what 
services the market is demanding.
	
✓	They watch the competition, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and 
try to out-maneuver them.
	
✓	They define their target customers clearly.
	
✓	They get their name out there and proactively pursue the customers 
they want.
	
✓	They understand the customer journey clearly, with special attention to 
the buyer’s journey.
	
✓	They know where the buyer is at every stage and interact appropriately.
	
✓	They’re willing to walk away if a deal isn’t a fit, or they refer it to some-
one else.
	
✓	They pitch, sell and close business with efficient speed.
	
✓	They choose partners who can make them more successful than they 
can be alone.
	
✓	They deliver well (of course) and they use their customer base to get 
new customers and to provide valuable feedback.
	
✓	They’re in a state of continuous improvement.
	
Long list, huh? To get to where these firms are includes you strategizing, mar-
keting, selling, managing your customers, partnering, evaluating how you’re 
doing and reinventing. Then around you go again (sorry to make you dizzy!).
If you’re feeling a little overwhelmed right now, don’t worry. I deal with that 
in the later, appropriately named section ‘Dealing with overwhelm’.
Placing the Customer Experience  
Center Stage
If you don’t have customers, you don’t have a business – so obviously your 
customers matter to you a whole lot. You need to be interested in what they 
need right now, not in what you want to sell them. If you’re just trying to 
sell, your ears are closed to any opportunities that may lead to a large break-
through in your business – a referral to a new customer, a testimonial, an 
opportunity for a business partner.

 Chapter 1: Introducing Business Development for Services Firms
Before you worry too much about how to do business development, step back, 
put customers first and look at things from their points of view (you get the 
chance to do this in depth in Chapters 3 and 4). What happens is that you start 
to see things you haven’t spotted before and you start to do things differently.
Deconstructing the customer lifecycle
One way to dig into the customer experience is to understand what an inter-
action feels like for a customer.
As a taster, what do customers say they like and not like about services firms? 
Table 1-1 gives you a few things to chew over. Do any of them seem familiar?
Table 1-1	
What Customers Say They Dislike and Like
Customers Dislike Vendors Who . . . 
Customers Like Vendors Who . . . 
Don’t listen
Are clear about what they’ll do and 
how their actions are going to help
Talk about themselves all the time
Understand my business and how it 
works
Don’t ask questions
Ask lots of questions (so that I get to 
talk)
Try to ‘sell’ me something I don’t need
Are interested in my goals and needs
Don’t seem interested in my business
Give me exactly the right information at 
the right time
Don’t finish the work
Help me understand how to fix my 
problem – if they’re not the solution, 
they say so
Over-promise and under-deliver –
namely, they don’t give value for money
Charge fees that are fair and I get what 
I expected (or more)
Good business development gives customers what they need at every stage 
of the relationship.
	
Customers often have a fractured experience: they don’t receive calls back 
from the service firm, they have to answer the same questions over and over, 
they don’t hear enough about project progress, they just see a lot of invoices. 
You can use the chapters in Part I to help avoid these sorts of issues.

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
Understanding the customer experience is the key to great business develop-
ment. You want to talk to your customers, and your prospective customers, 
as much as you can.
Mapping business development 
to the customer lifecycle
The closer you get to your customers, who after all represent your market-
place, the more clearly you see how to develop your business. Just like you, 
they’re trying to stay ahead of the rest of the market. They know, if they’re 
any good, what their competition is up to. They know the trends in their 
industry. They can give you insights that rock your world, hopefully in a good 
way, but not always. Either way, you need to know.
	
At best, your customers help you develop your business. How cool is that!
Making Business Development 
Manageable in a Small  
Business
If your response to business development is ‘I hear what you’re saying, but 
what you’re saying is not my reality. I’m just surviving from day to day. I don’t 
have the time to worry about what my customer thinks’, this book is defi-
nitely for you.
If you’re living in survival, that’s a sure sign of overwhelm, namely being too 
busy to take on yet one more thing. You’re working in the business, not on it. 
That needs to change.
Dealing with overwhelm
You’re in a high-stress mode right now or you will be – it’s inevitable. In the 
end, you have to move away from the 12-hour (or more) workdays, total 
exhaustion and feeling like a hamster on a wheel. Larger, successful com-
panies have a business development engine, cranking away, supporting the 
growth of the company. Do leaders in larger firms work hard and experience 
stress? Of course they do. The difference is that those larger companies have 
worked out the strategies for dealing with challenges and have the resources 
to tackle what the market throws at them, most of the time.

15
 Chapter 1: Introducing Business Development for Services Firms
	
To start moving in this direction, you need to take two steps:
	
1.	Break the cycle of overwhelm by stepping back and creating a plan of 
action. If you can’t see the wood for the trees, how can you know where 
you are?
	
2.	Implement the most important, pressing aspects of the plan. In this 
way, you start making a difference right away.
I describe creating and implementing your business development plan in 
Chapters 6 and 7, respectively. But to get to the plan, you have to do some 
self-assessment. I’m sure that you’re doing certain things efficiently, but cer-
tain things you may not be doing well, or at all. You can unearth gold when 
you uncover your shortcomings. The section ‘Looking for the obvious and 
not so obvious problems’ in Chapter 2 helps you with this task.
	
No silver bullet exists. Luck does, like a new customer calling you out of the 
blue, but you can’t build a business on luck. The sooner you start taking con-
trol of your business growth, instead of just hoping this growth is going to 
happen, the sooner you see results. If it was easy, companies would never fail.
Anticipating growth and its 
impact on your business
Companies often say, ‘We just need more work.’ Maybe that’s true – but I 
have to quarrel with the ‘just’, as if having more work solves every business 
problem. Growth is exciting, but also dangerous.
In a sense, where you are right now is comfortable. I’m not saying that you 
have it easy, just that you probably have a fixed way of working and when 
problems arise, you know what to do and what your co-workers need to 
do too.
But if you’re at $1 million (£630,000) in revenue today, do you know what 
your $5 million (£3.15 million) company is going to look like? For sure it won’t 
look the same, act the same or do things that same way. You’ll have more 
people and cash flow challenges, be awarded bigger projects of higher com-
plexity; maybe quality slips, and process and formality become important. 
Your role changes and the nature of the pressure is different. You’ll need to 
become expert in things you don’t have that much experience with today. 
You’ll need to plan for those changes too. They’re a-coming and maybe faster 
than you think. Get ready for some discomfort. It’s heady stuff.

Taking stock of where you are
You probably want to see growth. If you don’t, that’s okay – you can still find 
ideas in this book to make life easier on the business development front. 
Unless you’re involved in a start-up, you’re dealing with an existing situation, 
whether you’re new to the company or you founded it.
Knowing the services-firm growth patterns
Doing more of what you’re already doing can work, but, and this ‘but’ is a big 
one, the patterns of growth in services companies are pretty predictable and 
surprisingly revealing. They look something like Figure 1-1.
	
Figure 1-1: 
Growth 
pattern of 
services 
firm.
	
	
Here are the phases in the growth pattern:
	
✓	Period A: Spell of initial growth fuelled by your network, or a growth 
spurt after a ‘flat’ spell.
	
✓	Period B: A plateau, sometimes flat but also sometimes a gentle but wor-
rying seesawing of revenue. Enough to keep the owners awake at night.
	
✓	Period C: Loss of a major customer or some other catastrophic event. 
Now no one is sleeping.
After periods of growth, services firms typically settle around an average 
revenue level where they seem to get stuck. Why is that? Well, imagine that 
you acquired 12 new customers last year and your revenue was $2 million 
(£1.26 million). You’d like to double that next year to $4 million (£2.52 mil-
lion). So you need at least one of the following three things to happen:
	
✓	Find 24 new customers this year of the same size as last year.
	
✓	Obtain fewer, but larger, new customers.

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
17
 Chapter 1: Introducing Business Development for Services Firms
	
✓	Fill the gap between the revenue from customers that will carry over to 
this year, even if they give you more business.
Whatever the stage of your company’s development, you’re probably facing 
one of these scenarios. I guess that you were busy last year, just getting the 
12 customers. You’re going to need to do more or different things than you 
did last year to be successful in doubling your revenue.
Reacting to the signs that your firm needs to change
You may succeed by doing what you did before, but you’ll have to do more of 
it. That strategy can certainly work when you’re in a growth phase and you 
haven’t fully tapped the potential of your current approach.
If that thought makes you nervous, however, perhaps you know that your 
current tactics won’t work or you can see a Period-B plateau looming. Those 
signs indicate that you need to change your strategy.
	
The other sign that things may need a shake-up is when you start losing your 
biggest customers. Sorry to be so full of warnings, but that’s the reality of 
small businesses. You’re at high risk until you have a broad portfolio of cus-
tomers where the loss of one is a nuisance and causes a wrinkle, but doesn’t 
result in terminations or shutting the company down. Time to burn the mid-
night oil reading this book and selecting tactics that you can initiate immedi-
ately. You’re in danger of going down.
When experiencing a risky situation, or even just when stuck, business 
owners say things like:
	
✓	I worry about making payroll.
	
✓	I don’t know what my projected revenue will be in three months.
	
✓	We keep losing on price.
	
✓	I guess this is as big as we’re going to get.
	
✓	I think I’ll go and do something else.
	
Ask yourself what you’re worrying about the most? Before you can move on, 
you need to be clear about where you are and realize the implications of not 
doing anything about it beyond your usual approach. Don’t resist the facts of 
your current situation. Write down the specific business issues you’re stress-
ing about.
When you’ve done that quick exercise, starting to look for solutions becomes 
much easier. In a way, you’re going through the same journey your customers 
do when they’re faced with business challenges that threaten their situation. 
Relish what’s happening – first, because you’re ready to take a long, hard look 
and, secondly, because you can find solutions – and quickly.

Chapter 2
Finding Damaging Gaps in Your 
Business Development
In This Chapter
▶	Staying strong by addressing weaknesses
▶	Discussing dilemmas for services firms
▶	Assessing where your business is now
G
 
aps can be a real pain and usually indicate a weakness of some sort, 
whether they’re gaps in business knowledge, like not feeling comfort-
able with marketing, or things you haven’t attended to, like gaps in clothes 
that need repairing! Identifying and fixing weaknesses takes money and effort, 
but the cost of not addressing them is higher. You can’t do things you don’t 
understand and you may lose a sale when a hole appears in your worn suit 
during a meeting, turning you instantly from successful entrepreneur to hobo!
I assume that you’re reading this book to discover how to do better in busi-
ness development, whether your firm’s revenue has plateaued or is seesaw-
ing (check out Chapter 1 for more details). Perhaps you’re wondering why 
getting business is so difficult when your firm is good at what it does and pro-
vides value to its customers. You’re busy, you want more business, so maybe 
you just need to do more of what’s been working. Unfortunately, simply 
working harder can overwhelm you and lead you to feel that life is nothing 
but work. As a result, you experience a knock-on effect on your health and 
wellbeing – and on your family and leisure time.
Doing more of what you did yesterday just isn’t enough. You may have been 
fine up to now, but growth needs robust business development – it’s the 
engine of your business. This chapter helps by uncovering some of the gaps 
in your business development practices. This chapter is about taking stock – 
don’t skip or short-change it. Take a real, long look as I describe the signs of 
inadequate business development and the particular challenges that services 
firms face.

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
	
If your first thought on hearing the phrase ‘business development’ is ‘sales’, 
read Chapter 1, where I break down business development into its component 
parts.
Spotting Patchy Business Development
You’re not a leader for nothing. You’re where you are now because of your 
ambition, strengths, capabilities and, like everyone else, weaknesses.
	
Your strengths originate in your innate capabilities and preferences: in other 
words, you’re doing what comes naturally to you. Your weaknesses stem from 
trying to do what’s not natural for you. Any chance these weaknesses may be 
connected to the gaps in your business development? Bingo!
In this section I give you a heads-up on the dead giveaways of poor business 
development, discuss some of the obvious and less obvious problems, and 
help you think like one of your customers.
Recognizing the tell-tale signs of 
weak business development
If your business development is patchy, you’re likely to see signs such as the 
ones I list in Table 2-1. Which ones have you experienced?
Table 2-1	
Tell-Tale Signs of Weak Business Development
Signs
Consequences
Your revenue plateaus.
You feel stuck. You spend time trying 
to maintain your revenue level/retain 
your staff.
Your revenue fluctuates.
You’re caught in a seesaw of uncer-
tainty. Do you need to lay off people? 
Do you need to get a line of credit? 
How do you survive the next ‘low’ and 
make it to the next ‘high’?
You can’t predict what your business 
will look like in three months.
Stress and uncertainty. You can’t make 
hiring or firing decisions. You can’t 
make commitment to any investment. 
Can you even survive?

 Chapter 2: Finding Damaging Gaps in Your Business Development
Signs
Consequences
You do business development only 
when you seem to be running out of 
work.
Extreme panic. You take whatever you 
can get. You approach opportunities in 
a desperate frame of mind. You don’t 
really have a sales ‘pipeline’ or if you 
do, the pipeline is way too small to 
meet your revenue goals.
You have limited market reach.
Your database of contacts, both pros-
pects and other business contacts, is 
limited and your market recognition is 
low.
Your employees’ morale is low.
Staff don’t feel as if they’re working for 
a dynamic and thriving organization.
The competition is killing you.
You’re losing ground to new players 
who are more credible and who have 
a better market presence and a better 
offer.
	
The signs in Table 2-1 mean that you have an on-again-off-again approach to 
business development or you have gaps in your business development that 
limit the opportunities to engage with your customers. These gaps can result 
in serious problems:
	
✓	You and your people doing activities that don’t generate results
	
✓	An offer that’s getting out of date
	
✓	A lack of overall goals and plans to achieve them
	
✓	Unpredictability in the business
Ouch!
Looking for the obvious and the  
not-so-obvious problems
Why is business development problematic for smaller firms? I hear the fol-
lowing misconceptions regularly:
	
✓	Something else is always more urgent.
	
✓	I’m fine when I get in front of a prospect – I just need more leads.

✓	I have plenty of business right now – I don’t need any more.
	
✓	The firm hasn’t needed it up to now.
	
✓	There are only so many hours in the day.
Everyone has well-worn paths in the brain that make change hard. For exam-
ple, consider the pattern of how you go about your work each day. Do you do 
the same things and have the same habits? What’s your first thought when 
you get out of bed? Is it:
	
✓	How on earth am I going to get everything done today?
	
✓	How can I make sure that my largest customer doesn’t cancel its 
contract?
	
✓	How can I find time to write that proposal for prospect Oddball 
Documentaries Inc. (‘Weirdness is our speciality!’)?
	
✓	How can I pay for the supplies that the business needs?
	
If your day-to-day life looks like the above, you’re in survival mode, doing only 
whatever seems most urgent. Maybe you’re juggling a lot of urgent issues and 
you only give your customers and your business development attention when 
you’re about to run out of business. That’s like giving your life partner the 
time of day only when they throw a tantrum or threaten to leave you.
	
You can discover a lot by tracking your time for a week. Yes, I know you don’t 
have time to do that, but do it anyway. You need to know, because it reveals 
where you’re focusing your time and where you’re not:
	
1.	Take a piece of paper and divide it into four boxes. Label them along 
the lines of ‘Administration’, ‘Business development’, ‘Leading/Working 
on a customer project’ and ‘Working with staff’ (or whatever four divi-
sions are appropriate for your situation).
	
2.	Take a stab (in the meantime so that you can get on with this chap-
ter), at predicting what you’ll find in the timekeeping exercise. Where 
do you spend your time in each of the four areas? (Look at the bullets 
below for ideas.)
	
3.	Compare where you’re actually spending time to where you think that 
you’re spending it. This exercise can be really illuminating.
Here’s a little more detail on the four areas:
	
✓	Administration: Finance, general email, rearranging your desk and engag-
ing with admin staff or professionals such as accountants, legal or HR.
	
✓	Business development: Planning, reviewing progress against goals, 
researching and studying the market, spending time with prospects/­
customers, writing proposals and contracts, creating/developing busi-
ness ideas, doing marketing and going to networking events.

23
 Chapter 2: Finding Damaging Gaps in Your Business Development
	
✓	Leading/Working on a customer project: Being the project manager or 
subject matter expert (that is, leading the team) or doing actual work on 
a customer engagement (namely, being on the team). Clearly, the more 
time you spend being on the team, the more swamped you get as your 
business grows.
	
✓	Working with staff: Hiring, developing, planning, delegating and inspect-
ing the work of your staff.
	
Don’t make the mistake of saying that business development is getting little 
time because you’re busy with customers, you love administration or you’re 
always facing a higher priority. Business development is your highest priority!
Thinking like your customers
Business development can be weak because you’re inwardly focused – in 
other words, running the company and doing ‘the work’. Nothing’s wrong 
with that, but you need to look outside too – at the market, at your competi-
tion, and at your prospective and actual customers and their needs.
	
I suggest that you adopt a new take on business development. Shifting to the 
point of view of the customer provides that new perspective and has you bal-
ance your efforts across key activities that you and your customer both need. 
Take your shoes off, move to another chair and imagine that you’re in the 
head of one of your customers. Ask questions such as:
	
✓	What are my customers concerned about? What are they trying to 
accomplish?
	
✓	What keeps my customers awake at night?
Whenever you work on your business development, make that mental leap 
into a customer’s head. I talk a lot more about developing a deep understand-
ing of your customers in Chapter 3.
	
Your customers don’t care about your business development practices – not 
one jot. They care about their own survival and the problem that’s staring 
them in the face. That’s why the best meetings are usually ones where the cus-
tomer does 80 percent of the talking.
From your point of view, the customer relationship is cyclical. It repeats 
over and over, sometimes with the same customer, definitely with others. 
Figure 2-1 illustrates the business development cycle from a prospect/
customer viewpoint.
Take a tour round the circle to absorb its general drift. Start at the top 
with CREATE and go right around the circle, making sure that you’re in 
the customer’s head as you do so.

Figure 2-1: 
Going 
round and 
round the 
customer 
experience.
	
Here are a couple of things to grasp about how your business development is 
relevant to the customer:
	
✓	Customers want to be the one and only and to know that they have your 
attention from the first conversation to the point when you complete 
their work, get their feedback and move on. They want you to be obses-
sive about them. That’s their point of view – and there’s no shifting it.
	
✓	A couple of critical aspects of the customer experience in Figure 2-1 
don’t involve customers – one is when you EVALUATE their feedback 
and the other is when you do your own ‘Create’ (aka invent/reinvent 
your offer). I cover inventing your offer in depth in Chapter 5.
The customer’s perspective is so important because you can all too easily fall 
into the trap of thinking that the customer is interested in you because you’re 
the greatest thing since sliced bread.

25
 Chapter 2: Finding Damaging Gaps in Your Business Development
In reality, customers are interested in you only if they identify a need/­
problem/pain (call it what you will) and you can solve it. Imagine that 
Oddball Documentaries Inc. needs a film crew and your company supplies 
videographers at short notice. If you can connect when the need arises, 
you’re going to get a shot at doing business with that customer.
	
I use the word ‘need’ to identify why customers buy. It connects to Maslow’s 
Hierarchy of Needs (a 1943 theory by Abraham Maslow about human motiva-
tion), those fundamental human needs, such as eating, being safe and being 
appreciated, that everyone walks around with and that drive everyone’s actions.
	
The whole purpose of business development is to identify needs in the mar-
ketplace and create and deliver solutions that solve them. You have to under-
stand the customer need deeply – not only the overt need (like my partner’s 
suing me – I need a lawyer!), but also any hidden ones (the ones people have 
but don’t usually admit to, like being respected or being a hero). In Chapter 3, 
I help you uncover those hidden needs. They’re big drivers for why people 
buy – or do anything else for that matter.
Understanding Business Development 
Challenges for Services Firms
Business development presents particular issues for services firms, not least 
because the value of services is hard to articulate. When buying a product, 
businesses know what to expect, but the market doesn’t really want to pay 
for services unless it perceives a clear and tangible value. For that reason, 
searching for gaps that are damaging to business development, and hence to 
growth, for a services firm requires special consideration.
In this section I discuss the idea of value for services firms, just how impor-
tant you are as leader and the vital need to be proactive.
Identifying value in a services firm
Services firms enable customers to do business more efficiently, more effec-
tively. They help them answer tough business questions, resolve problems 
they have, do things they can’t do today, grow and thrive. As a services firm, 
you’re the source of these types of benefits for your customers. The tangible 
value lies in the fulfillment of need/removal of pain (see the earlier customer 
experience diagram in Figure 2-1). The journey for the customer starts with, ‘I 
can’t . . . ’, ‘I want to be able to . . . ’ or ‘I’m threatened by . . . ’.
	
Your customers and prospects want their pain fixed.

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
When you sell services, you’re selling people – their expertise, their track 
records, their credentials. The value lies in the people and what they can 
deliver. For example, if you’re a patent lawyer, a branding or marketing 
agency, or any kind of consulting company, you produce a work product. You 
need to demonstrate that your work product provides value. For example, if 
you solve a huge customer pain, that has value. Flip to Chapter 5 for how to 
get at the value that your services provide.
The customer is also buying from people. Research from Google and CEB 
(titled The Digital Evolution in B2B Marketing) shows that 57 percent of any 
business-to-business (B2B) sales process now happens online, before the 
customer ever talks to you – you can read what to do about that in Part III. 
Fortunately for you, business happens between people and you have to talk 
in person – you and your prospect, your team and their team. If a prospect 
is going to let you into its business to solve knotty problems, it wants to be 
comfortable with you and your people.
Therefore, the leaders of those people need to get their act together. And 
who leads your team of people? You do.
‘You’re the top!’ The owner-led sale
Cole Porter’s song says it well: in the end, the customer wants to talk to the 
top – the big cheese, owner, partner or long-standing leader in your firm. 
This section is for owners, or others who’ve been leaders in the firm, maybe 
since it started. No one, I repeat, no one can sell your business like you do. If 
you don’t have living proof of that in your own business, I’ll eat my hat (and 
I must be confident because my hat is pretty large, with all the trimmings – 
fruit, foliage, feathers, the works).
	
The problem is, if you’re the last port of call to a sale and everything that 
leads up to it (and even more so if you’re also involved in delivery), you can 
all too easily be the bottleneck to your business growth.
If you just want to maintain your services firm’s current level of success, 
that’s all fine and dandy, this book helps you do that. If you want expansion, 
however, the time comes (and you may already be there) where you just 
don’t have enough hours in the day to do more. You can’t solve the problem 
by working harder. You need to address the fact that, despite all your efforts 
for the firm, you may be strangling the growth because of how you approach 
business development.
‘Everybody wants to talk to you’
(Sing the heading to the tune by Tears for Fears!) As an owner, partner or 
long-standing leader in your services firm:

✓	You have natural authority. It comes with your title.
	
✓	You know the whole history of your company. You have intriguing sto-
ries of how you achieved X for company Y, in fascinating detail.
	
✓	You position your business better than anyone else in the organiza-
tion. You create confidence in the mind of prospects that your company 
can make a difference to them, so you’re on the hook for making sure 
that your firm does.
If you really are the only person in your company that can close a deal, 
manage a customer and bring the effort to a conclusion, you can’t be sur-
prised when absolutely everyone wants to talk to you.
	
After they meet you, customers won’t let you go. Much as you love your com-
pany, your capacity (that is, your involvement in so many aspects of your 
business) is the problem.
‘Don’t bottle things up!’
When you can’t squeeze any more productivity out of yourself, you’re 
involved in every sale, every delivery and sometimes every decision: you 
are your business and without you, it simply doesn’t exist. This position is 
unhealthy, untenable and can’t scale.
Business development gets you to your goal – whatever that is. If your busi-
ness can’t function without you, you’re unlikely to be able to reach that ulti-
mate goal. Growing your business, your revenue and your profits, means that 
you need to get help. Expansion requires hiring people, outsourcing, barter-
ing for support, whatever it takes.
	
If your firm is over-reliant on you, you have to transition your role from the 
‘I’m it, I’m doing everything, I have to jump in here’ to a leadership role. It 
won’t happen overnight – you have to plan for that shift. Part II of this book 
shows you how to create your plan and how your role as a business develop-
ment leader will emerge.
Being proactive rather than reactive
Do you react to threats to your revenue stream, to the phone ringing, to a 
customer complaint, to an upstart competitor? Of course you do. But that’s 
what needs to shift about your role within your services firm – from reactive 
to proactive. When everything you do is reactive, you basically get what the 
world throws at you. When you start to be proactive, you create your destiny. 
Being proactive about your future business is what business development is 
all about.

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
Applying consistent effort
Business development produces results when the discipline and practice 
of business development become as important as other activities such as 
administration, working with customers and working with staff.
For example, tomorrow you may decide that business development is less 
important than some administrative tasks you have to get done. That would 
be ridiculous, right? But that’s what thousands of business owners and man-
agers do every day. They set aside business development because they’re 
too busy – they may characterize it as handling priorities. I suggest that they 
have their priorities wrong.
	
Strive to make business development a consistent part of your day-to-day 
activity.
If you haven’t already completed the time analysis exercise I mention in 
the earlier section ‘Looking for the obvious and the not-so-obvious prob-
lems’, do so now. (By the way, reading this book comes under the Business 
Development heading, in case you weren’t sure!) Consider where your time 
goes. What percentage of time do you spend on the following:
	
✓	Creating or refining your market offer
	
✓	Educating your prospects
	
✓	Presenting to your prospects, based on a real opportunity
	
✓	Proposing work with pricing
	
✓	Contracting, including negotiation and legal paperwork
	
✓	Delivering services
	
✓	Completing on services
	
✓	Evaluating your offer
	
Small services businesses give attention to talking to ‘real’ prospects, writ-
ing proposals and contracts, and delivering: in other words, being reactive to 
opportunities. But they’re often less strong in broader tactics, such as pro-
actively reaching out to the market, educating prospects, asking customers 
how the work’s going, or in critical introspection, analysis and creation. Make 
sure that you don’t make this mistake.
Realizing that the world’s your oyster: The power of proactivity
Taking on yet more work than you already have can be daunting, but here’s 
the upside: you start to work on what matters, not so much on what comes 
up on a daily basis.

29
 Chapter 2: Finding Damaging Gaps in Your Business Development
Initially, small firms grow more by accident than by design. They take on 
whichever customers show up at the door, people they’re referred to or 
those they meet at a networking event. They don’t necessarily select the 
customers they want to work with, create proactive approaches to those cus-
tomers, control the sales process or fire unprofitable clients.
	
Your services firm benefits when you visualize a world in which you create 
your destiny in the marketplace and approach it proactively. To help, Table 2-2 
describes a few symptoms of reactive versus proactive business development.
Table 2-2	
Reactive versus Proactive Business Development
Reactive Business Development
Proactive Business Development
Time spent talking to ugly duckling 
prospects in the hope that they’ll 
somehow turn into swans.
Little time spent on ugly ducklings. 
They’re not the customers for you and 
you gracefully back off.
Lots of hard work chasing prospects, 
getting them to return calls or take the 
next step.
Prospects collaborate with you in the 
process. If they don’t, you back away.
High levels of deal loss.
Prospects that aren’t a good fit are 
eliminated early (they never get to a 
‘deal’).
You discount a lot.
You talk about price early and you 
negotiate when and if you’re selected, 
not earlier.
You lose on price.
You win on value.
You fear the competition.
The competition fears you. You win the 
deals you want and you let them win 
the ones you don’t want.
Your reputation in the marketplace is 
scattered (you take on anything).
Your reputation in the marketplace is 
clear – you work with customers that 
fit your requirements, not with those 
who don’t.
You try to do whatever the customer 
requests.
You do what you do and you regularly 
review that in case it needs updating, 
extending or replacing.
	
Assess now whether your firm is mostly reactive or whether you’re garner-
ing some of the benefits of proactive business development. When you have 
a good handle on where you’re being proactive and where reactive, you can 
plan for a more proactive approach (something I help you tackle in Part II).

Taking Stock of Where You Are
At any point in your business growth, stopping and taking stock is well 
worthwhile – and I’m not talking about products in a warehouse (I hope that 
activity’s a given!). I mean asking yourself questions such as: are things going 
well; are you enjoying your job; are you worried to death?
In this section I help you orientate yourself in relation to business development, 
which involves analyzing the state of your firm, what you’re doing and what 
you’re not doing. The damaging gaps are to be found in what you’re not doing.
	
Business development is about mastery – you never get to the top of the 
mountain, because another peak is always on the horizon. At any time, some 
areas in your business need work – glory in that fact.
What you’re not doing – and  
being okay with it
Unless you were entrepreneurial at 7 years old and you’ve carried on creat-
ing new ideas and new companies, you likely worked for someone else before 
you decided to start you own business.
	
A useful exercise is to ask yourself why you set up your own firm (what was in 
your mind at that time?) and then contrast it by thinking about what you’re 
saying to yourself today. To help, compare the columns in Table 2-3.

I have historical customers I did work for 
who’ll give me their business.
The firm keeps losing on price.

else.

 Chapter 2: Finding Damaging Gaps in Your Business Development
You took the leap and created that small business. You were excited. You 
knew who your first customers were going to be to give you that initial rev-
enue stream, and you relied on referrals and your broader network for your 
initial growth. You worked really hard to get to where you are.
If you’re not the owner, your motivation for joining a small business may be 
similar or something entirely different. Think back to what encouraged you to 
make the leap.
In that early period of your business, you ran on string and sticky tape. Not 
everything was buttoned down, not everything was perfect, but it was excit-
ing and you survived. At times you weren’t doing things and you were okay 
with that. You did everything you could until you fell into bed exhausted at 
the end of every long day, including weekends.
When your revenue starts to plateau and you have to work just as hard to 
stand still as you previously did to grow, you’re saying some of the things in 
Table 2-3’s second column. The ‘beating-yourself-up’ that business owners 
go through, the determination to work more, faster, harder, is the sign of true 
commitment, but it doesn’t get the desired result.
You scratch my back . . .
I’m part of a CEO group, founded by Jeff Cohen, 
called ‘C-Level Group: No Business Left Behind’. 
We’re self-help, so people bring their problems 
to the group for objective advice. Someone 
around the table is likely to have tackled what 
I’m dealing with, tried solutions, failed and suc-
ceeded. Growing a business is a team game, 
so if your internal team is light on experience, 
go outside.
Each member creates a goal for three years out 
for their business and then works backwards 
for where they need to be in two years, one year 
and so on. Finally, they look at the next three 
months in detail, specifically what they need to 
do for the next month to keep moving forward. 
Sometimes they identify areas where they know 
that they have a weakness – in recruitment, in 
doing the books or in how to grow.
Rod, Owner of West Coast Gaskets, a manu-
facturer and installer of a specific refrigera-
tor parts needed by shops and restaurants, 
couldn’t see how to expand his business 
without hiring lots more installers. We brain-
stormed two ideas: (a) putting an eCom-
merce site together to sell to other installers 
and (b) partnering with installers all over the 
country and supplying them with parts. Both 
actions would expand his business by increas-
ing his manufacturing – he’s actively working 
on them.
If you want to set up a group like this, connect 
with Jeff Cohen (www.linkedin.com/

started with your own support group – he’ll be 
delighted to help.

To create what’s next, you need to rekindle the excitement you had when 
you started. One way to do that is to pretend that you just acquired the very 
company you already own or work for. You’re the new owner or leader. Ask 
yourself what the firm does well and what not so well. Ask how you’re going to 
grow it from $2 million to $10 million and beyond. Stop blaming yourself that 
things aren’t perfect today. They never will be.
Forgive yourself for where you are and get to work on creating a new future. 
A much respected CEO friend of mine said: ‘Be the company that’s $10 million 
and you’ll get there.’
	
Plugging the gaps in your business development may take more objectivity 
than you alone can provide. Check out the sidebar ‘You scratch my back . . . ’ 
for an example solution.
It’s a numbers game: How’s 
your firm really doing?
Do you know how you’re doing? If you don’t, disaster can strike suddenly and 
take you down quickly.
See whether you can answer the following questions:
	
✓	What was your revenue last month, last year?
	
✓	What’s your gross margin percentage?
	
✓	What’s your goal for this year? How are you measuring your progress?
	
✓	How many prospects are you talking to right now? Is the number 
increasing, decreasing or staying about the same?
	
✓	What’s your highest revenue customer? And the next? And the next?
	
✓	Which customers are you losing money on?
Don’t beat yourself up if you don’t know all the answers. You’re a great com-
pany and you’re in good company. But if you’re not tracking key metrics, 
making good decisions is that much harder. Turn to Chapters 12 and 13 for 
some good business development metrics.
When you combine metrics with a goal and plan for how to reach it, you have 
powerful tools for seeing whether you’re on track or for changing course if 
you’re not.

Chapter 3
Diving Inside Your 
Customer’s Head
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding your customer’s requirements
▶	Building your business development lifecycle
I
 
 know that this chapter’s title sounds a bit like one of those Hollywood 
movies where a scientist is shrunk and injected into another person’s 
body, but you can relax. I’m talking metaphorically here and simply mean 
that understanding your customers is essential.
In fact, if such a thing as a magic key to business development exists, you 
find it in a deep understanding of your prospective, current and past custom-
ers. They represent the marketplace and they can provide the clues as to 
what the marketplace wants.
In Chapter 2, I focus on you and your business development health, but here 
I ask you to step into your customer’s world more fully. After all, love ’em or 
hate ’em, customers are the reason you’re doing business, and shifting your 
focus to the customer’s viewpoint helps you to see new possibilities.
In this chapter I drill down into the early stages of the customer relationship, 
which are typically where vendors most commonly make the wrong moves. 
You take a deep breath and dive into thinking about your customers, seeking 
to interact seriously with their concerns and desires. I describe a business 
development concept that focuses on them and not on you, which allows you 
to see where and why you may need to change your approach.

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
Uncovering Your Customers’ Real Needs
All kinds of customers exist: one-time, repeat and those who spend a lot 
upfront and then need ongoing support or maintenance of some sort. 
Acquiring and serving customers is part of the practice of business develop-
ment and your efforts need to depend on understanding not only who your 
customers are, but also on what they’re thinking at every stage in your rela-
tionship with them.
	
Write or print out a list of your current and past customers (and prospective 
ones too, if you have that info) and think about what sorts of organizations or 
individuals they are.
Ask yourself the following questions:
	
✓	Size of your customers: Are they big business, mid-sized, small? Do they 
belong to specific verticals (industries)? Are they for-profit or non-profit?
	
✓	Within your customers: Which roles do you interact with in your deal-
ings with your customers? Who specifically signs your contracts, who 
has a say in the purchase, who consumes your services? A number of 
people with different job titles may well be involved.
	
✓	Nature of your customers: Which customers are ‘great’ and which are 
‘not so great’? What defines a nightmare customer for you?
Yup, those nightmare customers sure do keep you awake at night. Take a look 
at the following list to see whether anything sounds familiar. Do you have any 
customers who:
	
✓	Don’t co-operate with you
	
✓	Are late with their part of the work – unprepared for you, not providing 
the information you need and so on
	
✓	Pay late
	
✓	Are judgmental, even abusive when things don’t go well
	
✓	Are disrespectful
	
✓	Don’t appreciate or value your services
	
✓	Refuse to provide references when asked
	
✓	Never provide referrals to prospective customers
	
✓	Show no interest in your business (and after all you’ve done for them!)

 Chapter 3: Diving Inside Your Customer’s Head
Surely, a good customer is the exact opposite of this description.
	
Perhaps you’re thinking (like Kylie) ‘I should be so lucky’ to have perfect cus-
tomers, but luck isn’t the only factor involved in what customers you get. You 
can start by being clear about what sorts of customers you’re looking for and 
turning away others.
Yep, that’s right: I said it! Turning away customers. And I mean it. You’ll never 
have the sort of business you want, the sort of working existence you want, 
unless you have the right customers. For more on getting such customers, 
flip to Chapter 5.
Unlike your prospects, your past customers have one thing in common – 
they wanted what you have to offer (that is, what you say your customers 
get when they work with you) and were ready to buy it. You need to be clear 
what it was that they were willing to buy.
A tale of social media
Imagine that you’re the customer and you’re 
asking yourself whether you should use social 
media in your business. If you were to seek 
help from a social media agency (a company 
that manages your presence and content on 
social media), what would you be buying and 
what would they be selling? Jot your thoughts 
down and then take a look at this table.
What I’m Buying versus What They’re Selling
What You’re Buying
What They’re Selling
Help in using social media to promote 
your business
Getting your Facebook page, LinkedIn 
profiles and Twitter account set up and 
then managing them
Writing content to post on social media
 
Strategy and execution for social 
media reputation management
The key phrase is reputation management. The 
social media agencies exist to manipulate the 
social media (in a good way) on your behalf. 
They’re building your reputation and, just as 
importantly, protecting it from harm by taking 
corrective action when someone says some-
thing nasty about you. What you thought you 
wanted may not be what you actually need – 
’nuff said.

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
Understanding what customers need 
today and whether they know it
Sometimes, what you’re selling and what your customers are buying are 
aligned, sometimes they’re not. Customers think that they know what they 
need, but their perspective is different from yours. You may well say, entirely 
without arrogance, that you know better. You want to say to them, ‘You think 
you want this but you actually need this.’
Ask yourself this question: is your offer aligned with what customers say they 
need, or is it a struggle to have them understand why they should buy what 
you’re offering? If your answer is the latter, don’t worry – you’re in good com-
pany. After all, if customers knew exactly what they needed, they’d have to 
know what you know and they wouldn’t need you anymore. That’s the beauty 
of services – you bring your special knowledge to solve a customer’s pain.
Another reason that prospects are sometimes slow to buy is that they have 
hidden needs (the ones that don’t get talked about). These hidden needs are 
at least as important as the overt need or problem they’re trying to fix. If 
you can take care of customers’ fears, hopes and dreams, their experience of 
working with you is elevated to a whole new level.
While asking yourself what your customers clearly need (items directly 
related to their pain), don’t forget those hidden (deeper) needs. At the very 
minimum, they’re thinking (subconsciously), how they can:
	
✓	Hire the right vendor
	
✓	Avoid getting fired
	
✓	Look good (to boss, board, partner)
	
✓	Be a hero by solving a business issue that’s driving people crazy
	
Believe me, no one buys anything unless it fulfills a need – whether that need 
is hunger (‘I gotta eat right now’) or to look good (‘my next car needs to be a 
Jaguar’). Purchases are a response to a need, whether you know you have that 
need or the ad industry created it for you.
	
Consider the following: when you bought this book, what was your overt 
need? What are your subconscious needs? Now repeat the experiment for 
your customers. What’s their overt need and what are their hidden needs?

37
 Chapter 3: Diving Inside Your Customer’s Head
The ways in which humans take action to fulfill their needs is a complex matter, 
so stay on the lookout for unspoken needs. Use Chapter 5 to tweak your offer 
to account for those hidden needs. At the very least, you’ll refresh it; and if you 
can fulfill known needs and deal with hidden ones, your customers will keep 
coming back for more and talk about you to everyone they know.
Staying current with your 
customers’ needs
I don’t have to tell you that the world is changing – fast. The great offer that 
you have today may work just fine tomorrow, or it may not. You have to keep 
an eye on the marketplace – your antennae need to be up all the time, feeling 
for what’s in the wind.
If you use social networks at all, you know how quickly the latest YouTube 
video, diet tip, travel destination (or whatever topic you’re interested in) gets 
shared, goes viral and then just as quickly dies down. My friends at Influence 
Ecology call this the current. As with the current in a river, you can get swept 
up in the hype of the marketplace.
The business world has a current too, except that the trends aren’t quite 
as volatile (unless you’re a daily trader). Moving the mountain of a large 
corporation, or even the hill of a middle-sized one, takes a little longer than 
persuading an individual to book a massage. The business-to-business (B2B) 
market moves more slowly, shifting in weeks or months, rather than days. 
Even so, a current (an opinion as to what matters and what doesn’t, what the 
latest ‘thing’ is and whether it’s any good or not) exists and if you try to swim 
against it, you’re certainly going to struggle. Swim with it and life gets much 
easier.
Not changing; drowning
Sanjiv has a lifetime of experience in a specific 
software solution used to power manufactur-
ing. Over many years, despite all the software 
manufacturer’s efforts to refresh its product, 
the marketplace started to replace the system 
with newer, more up-to-date software. Sanjiv 
was convinced that companies still needed 
support for the original system, especially as 
programmers started to move into new tech-
nologies. His argument was that people had 
been buying what he offered for 20 years. 
He expected business to stay the way it had 
always been.
You won’t be surprised to hear that Sanjiv no 
longer has a business.

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
If you’re losing business to competitors and you suspect that they’re more 
up-to-date than you with their solutions and services, you may need to 
update. No point sitting around with no work, fingers crossed that the market 
wants your offer. That only happens if your offer’s current.
Table 3-1 shows ideas on where to look to see whether your offer is relevant 
to today’s marketplace and the questions to ask yourself.
Table 3-1	
Placing Yourself in the Market
Where You Look
What You Ask
Google (or your preferred search 
engine).
Do we need to account for any new 
trends?
Blogs, Twitter, industry analysts and 
market influencers. (Follow a few lead-
ers in your space and see what they’re 
talking about.)
Should we improve or change our offer 
(streamline, apply better methodology, 
automate, create a product)?
Competitors (websites, social pres-
ence, blogs, news).
What are they communicating to the 
marketplace and where/how are they 
doing that?
Professional trends (professional 
associations and their events, online 
groups, for example, LinkedIn).
Do we need to acquire new skills? 
Should we extend our capabilities?
Prospects (who they are, what they’re 
asking about, who they’re working 
with). Often found on competitor sites 
and on social sites. Also use informa-
tion from prospect interviews (after the 
sales process is done).
What are they interested in? What are 
they asking questions about?
What are your prospects giving as 
the reason for not awarding you the 
business?
	
Set aside three or four hours a month to spend time researching the market-
place to see what people are talking about. Try to do this research somewhere 
other than your office – a library or coffee shop is a good idea. Personal life 
permitting, a couple of quiet hours on a Sunday morning also works well.
	
Re-examine your offer on a regular basis to keep it current. Take feedback from 
your customers, staff and market intelligence seriously and then use Chapter 5 
to reinvent/reinvigorate your offer. It may need a small twist or a major revision. 
Either way, get it done, get it communicated to your team and get it out to the 
marketplace; and get used to reinvention. You’ll be doing it again and again.

 Chapter 3: Diving Inside Your Customer’s Head
Powering Growth Using Your 
Customer’s Viewpoint
The secret to growing your business is to get a handle on where your busi-
ness is right now as regards understanding your customers’ priorities and 
proceeding from that point effectively and purposefully. To help you achieve 
that aim, in this section I describe conducting customer interviews, investi-
gating your customer’s journey, orientating your business to your custom-
ers (not expecting things to work the other way around!) and exerting your 
influence.
Focusing on your customer: 
Why you should care
Telling people how good your business is at what it does misses the point. 
They may believe you, but frankly they don’t give two hoots.
Instead, when you pay attention to what your customer is saying you obtain 
the intelligence you need for creating and recreating your own business.
At two specific points in your relationship with your customers, you can 
interview them in a structured way:
	
✓	When you win or lose a deal: I cover a sample interview process in 
Chapter 14 and at www.dummies.com/go/businessdevelopment.
	
✓	When you complete a project, or midway through a longer project: 
Flip to Chapter 16 for a method at this stage.
	
Interviews with customers provide valuable information for you to use in 
designing your offer, adding to your marketing or leveraging for references and 
referrals. The interview is one of the most powerful yet underused tools in a 
services firm’s toolbox.
Check out Table 3-2, which contains an informal approach to these 
interviews.

Table 3-2	
Questions to Discover What Your Customers  
	
Think about Your Services
Who to talk to
What to ask customers
Customers (getting them to talk to you 
is usually fairly easy).
‘When did you decide to get help with 
[the specific need or problem that your 
firm solves]?’
‘Where did you look for information 
on how to solve the problem? What 
was most useful to you during that 
process?’
‘How did you find out about us?’
‘Who else did you consider?’
‘Before we signed our contract, 
what worked best for you about our 
interactions?’
‘What was least valuable?’
‘What did our competitors do well?’
‘What caused you to choose us/not 
choose us?’
‘When we started working together, 
what was effective for you?’
‘What didn’t work so well?’
‘Did we fulfill your need/solve your 
problem?’
‘What feedback would you have 
wanted to provide when we completed 
the work?’
‘Is there anything you would specially 
have valued that we didn’t do or didn’t 
do enough of?’
Prospects (usually best to interview 
them when they’ve given you, or not 
given you, the business).
Same as questions for customers 
down to:‘What caused you to choose 
us/not choose us?’

 Chapter 3: Diving Inside Your Customer’s Head
Who to talk to
What to ask customers
Your staff (who’ll be delighted to spill 
the beans). You get fuller answers to 
different questions, depending on who 
you talk to.
‘How well do you think potential new 
customers understand what we do?’
‘Do they understand how we’ll do 
things?’
‘Do we tell them the right things before 
they make their decision to work with 
us (or not)?’
‘Do you think we’re well aligned with 
our customers when we start the 
work?’
‘Are there any surprises as we kick off 
the work/project?’
‘What goes well for the customer and 
for us when we’re working together?’
‘What doesn’t go so well?’
‘Do we get enough feedback from the 
customer?’
‘Do we use feedback as fully as we 
could?’
‘Do you think what we offer customers 
is what they need?’
Prospects and customers can (and do) say things that take you by surprise. 
Often, these observations are really positive about your perceived or actual 
value to them, how well you understand them, their business and their indus-
try, what they’d like you to do next so that they can give you more business. 
Sometimes, they tell you what they think you should fix in your business. 
From these interviews, you get an insight into how your customer sees you. 
How cool is that!
	
Don’t be tempted to set up online surveys as a substitute for talking to your 
customers. If you have a lot of customers you can gather information online, 
but still select the most valuable customers and interview them live, prefer-
ably in person; telephone is second best. You don’t get the detailed feedback 
you need from an online survey and your prospects/customers don’t get the 
sense that you really care to listen to what they want to say. There’s gold in 
them there hills. Go mine it.

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
Mapping your customer’s journey
The period from the time that a prospect identifies a need, to the point at 
which that need is fulfilled, is the customer journey. To get fully into the 
customer’s head, you need to understand that journey and use it to your 
advantage.
As I mention in the earlier section ‘Understanding what customers need 
today and whether they know it’, remember that a business relationship has 
two sides:
	
✓	Your firm: With your view on how the relationship should go, what 
should happen in what order, how the services should be delivered and 
what works for you.
	
✓	Your customer: With its needs, its search for solutions and services, 
what it does and in what order, its engagement in the solution and the 
delivery, and what works for it.
Clearly you see the relationship one way and the customer sees it in quite 
another.
Figure 2-1 in Chapter 2 shows the cycle from the customer’s point of view. 
Figure 3-1 switches to your viewpoint. This is the business development life-
cycle. Certain steps in the lifecycle don’t involve the customer, specifically 
EVALUATE and INVENT, so this version covers stages that you and your com-
pany need to pay attention to but that don’t involve your customers directly.
	
Review this version of the lifecycle, download it from www.dummies.com/
go/businessdevelopment, print it out and slide it into this book – and pin 
a copy to your wall alongside Figure 2-1. You’re going to get to know these fig-
ures as well as you know your face.
As you upgrade your business development, which by the way never stops, 
use Figure 3-1 to help you plan your business development approach and 
then implement your plan. Chapter 2 helps you see the areas that aren’t 
working so make these areas your priority: you can’t implement everything at 
once. You build your high-level plan and then fill in the detail and tackle it a 
bit at a time.
Turning your business-development engine on requires that you:
	
1.	Understand what your customers are looking for at each stage in their 
experience.
	
2.	Understand the stages and how to interact with them at each stage.

3.	Map your business development to the customer experience – which 
includes planning your business development to fit your company.
	
4.	Implement the plan that you create.
	
5.	See the engine working (and not working), then rinse and repeat.

development practices and expand your results.

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
Table 3-3	
Stages in the Business Development Lifecycle
Stage
What Happens
INVENT
You’re creating or reinventing your offer to the marketplace. Your 
offer articulates the essence of how you help to fulfill a customer’s 
needs and solve its pains. This process is rigorous, requiring a 
deep dive into what customers want, what the marketplace is 
saying and what your staff can do.
EDUCATE
You have valuable information to share with the marketplace and 
you distribute that information to educate your customers and 
influence their (later) decision to talk with you and do business 
with you, when that specific need arises. Don’t expect everyone 
to be interested in your information – they’re only interested if the 
information is timely for them (that is, if they’re in the RESEARCH 
phase of the cycle).
PRESENT
You introduce your offer and gather information from the prospect 
about its business and its need. You’re assessing each other (like a 
first date, though hopefully less awkward!).
PROPOSE
You have enough information to propose a specific service that 
fulfills on the customer need. You only give a proposal if the cus-
tomer fits your profile of what a customer should be, co-operates 
with you in gathering information and has the time and budget to 
commit.
CONTRACT
You specify what you’ll provide/deliver, what the customer will 
provide/deliver and what the terms are under which you’re willing 
to engage.
DELIVER
You kick-off the work with the customer – you set the ground rules, 
the communication plan, the tools and the escalation process if 
things go off the rails. You also establish the contacts you need to 
operate effectively together.
You do the work in collaboration with the customer. You monitor 
the work to make sure that everything is going as planned, you 
adjust accordingly if not and you receive ongoing feedback from 
the customer’s team and from yours.
COMPLETE
You follow a formal completion process that has the customer sign 
off that you’re done with the work to its satisfaction, you make 
sure that you get final payment and you ask for specific feedback, 
references and referrals.
EVALUATE
You take your experience with this customer (and all your others), 
feedback from all interested parties and intelligence from your 
research of the marketplace, and you review whether your offer is 
still current and whether how you’re delivering it is working for cus-
tomers, for your team and for your business. You start the cycle over 
again, working the feedback in periodically to refresh your offer.

 Chapter 3: Diving Inside Your Customer’s Head
Joe’s early customer journey
As an example of what customers do and think 
in the early stages of the lifecycle, read about 
Joe’s journey.
Joe owns a tool-manufacturing company with 
revenues over $100 million (£63 million). His 
firm sells B2B all over the country with some 
overseas orders too. His current website is 
informational: it has a catalog, but it’s available 
as a pdf file, so you can’t easily search for a 
specific product, nor buy a product online. The 
company that created the website five years 
ago has gone out of business, so Joe knows he 
has to start over with a new vendor.
Joe’s business spends a lot of time (and hence 
money) serving smaller customers that represent 
about 15 per cent of his business. They mostly 
fax orders in, sometimes using an old catalog 
with inaccurate orders, which causes Joe’s firm 
a lot of trouble. Customer Service has to make 
phone calls to straighten things out. Joe wants 
to provide online ordering for his smaller custom-
ers, including taking payment upfront (saving his 
accounting department time chasing payables).
His IT department has never implemented a 
website, never mind an eCommerce system. 
His marketing team is two people, who spend 
all their time doing the catalog and placing 
trade adverts.
Joe realises that he needs to go through a 
number of progressive steps before he can 
consider doing a website/eCommerce project. 
He consults his IT application manager Sheetal, 
who knows how to make minor changes to the 
website, and his catalog compositor Phil, who 
posts the updated catalog to the website in pdf 
format regularly, but doesn’t touch any other 
pages in case he ‘breaks something’.
Despite the team’s lack of knowledge, Joe’s 
motivation is high as he launches into the 
process:
	
	 Education: Sheetal researches a number 
of available eCommerce solutions, while 
Phil looks at competitor websites and how 
catalogs are handled. He also analyzes the 
firm’s own site, to map what’s there. He 
calls a couple of smaller customers to ask 
what they think of the site. They reveal that 
they look at the catalog sometimes if the 
paper catalog has gone missing. They’ve 
even printed out all 200 pages, just to find 
the few specialized items they actually 
need to buy. Both customers would like to 
do online ordering – they’re used to that 
with other suppliers – and think that paying 
with credit cards would be fine. Joe gets 
the number of faxed orders and average 
order value from an ERP report. The firm 
takes around 5,000 orders per year that are 
$3,000 (£1,890) each on average.
	
	 Research/Planning: Sheetal finds a great 
whitepaper on the web about B2B eCom-
merce, which Joe devours. He discovers 
that it can be hugely complex and expen-
sive, but that if he keeps it simple he can 
probably get a website up and running 
within a few months. The team define the 
specific problem they’re trying to solve –  
providing an easy-to-use catalog and 
customer-ordering system on the web for 
smaller customers. Phil mentions a few 
other areas that they need on the website 
and gives Joe a list of the required pages.
They discuss hiring a person to lead the eCom-
merce efforts, but Joe feels they need more 
advice before trying that. He decides to talk 
to a few eCommerce companies. If you were 
an eCommerce software or services company, 
this point is when you’d hear from him (provid-
ing he’d ever heard of you, that is).

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
	
You can see how similar Figures 2-1 and 3-1 are. They represent the two view-
points: the customer’s and yours. The prospects go through a number of 
buyer or ‘customer experience’ stages (education, awareness, consideration, 
evaluation, justification, commitment and purchase) and then become cus-
tomers. Yaay! The better you understand the buyer’s journey, the better your 
business development lifecycle and plan is. Ask yourself, all the time, what 
would the customer think of this (what I’m saying, emailing, advertising, pro-
moting, presenting, promising).
The two diagrams are necessarily generic. The skill is to take your customer’s 
viewpoint into account and map your actions, resources, communication, 
analysis and responsiveness to its needs at any given moment. To do so, you 
use your business development lifecycle to design your approach and then 
follow through in practice – and you start to have happy customers.
	
Now, I know that customers aren’t right all the time. I’m guessing you’ve expe-
rienced that yourself. Sometimes they’re downright jerks (but as I say in the 
earlier ‘Uncovering Your Customers’ Real Needs’ section, you’re not going to 
continue working with them going forward, are you?). But if your organization 
has a culture of dissing the customer (‘They’re such a pain’, ‘They want every-
thing perfect first time’, ’They never say thank you, or well done’), you want to 
put a stop to that.
Using your customers’ viewpoints as the core of your thinking means that 
treating them as enemies or spoiled children doesn’t make sense. They’re 
your source of revenue, reputation, profit and, ultimately, wealth. Treat them 
with respect – they have hopes, dreams, challenges and fears, just like you. 
Listen out for these viewpoints and ‘be’ service. It pays.
	
Grasping the customer’s journey isn’t easy. Ask yourself the following ques-
tions. (If you want, also read the sidebar ‘Joe’s early customer journey’ and 
draw parallels with your own business.) What sort of thinking do your cus-
tomers go through before they ever talk to you? How many decisions have 
already been made? What can you influence and what’s already decided? How 
can you start to bring influence into the earlier stages? Is that even possible? 
I address these types of questions in Chapter 4, as you shift to becoming fully 
customer-centric.
Tailoring your solution to your customer’s 
need (not vice versa)
Most services firms live in a delusion that they’re so good at what they do, 
any customer would want to work with them. Selling to a friend, acquain-
tance or referral is easy – you already have an ‘in’ – but in the tough world

 Chapter 3: Diving Inside Your Customer’s Head
of the open marketplace you’re dealing with people who don’t know you or 
your work. You have to show that you understand their needs and that what 
you’re saying is relevant to them and adds real value to their business.
If you misunderstand the customer experience and its different stages, you 
can make the mistake of trying to sell customers something when they’re not 
yet ready to buy. From their point of view that appears pushy (customers 
complain about that a lot and you’ve probably experienced it yourself, as a 
customer).
	
To engage early on in your customer’s journey, you have to abandon ‘sell-
ing’ and be willing to contribute to customers’ research and planning. This 
approach means being eager to educate them and can even include suggesting 
that they look at solutions that aren’t yours. Ouch, that hurts! But if you aren’t 
willing to walk away when you see that the customer isn’t looking for exactly 
what you have to offer, you’ll end up chasing customers who don’t really want 
to buy what you’re offering and wasting time trying to convince them that 
they do. Mostly, they simply won’t return your calls.
When customers gather information, they sometimes do so accurately and 
sometimes not. (Check out the earlier sidebar ‘Joe’s early customer journey’. 
Joe formed a bunch of opinions before ever talking to an expert.) They start 
to shape their judgments on what help they need and what they can do them-
selves, what’s valuable, what’s not, how long it should take, how much it will 
or should cost. You’re faced with pre-conceived ideas and judgments that you 
may have to upset before you can sell your services. Of course, you should 
only sell your services if the customer needs them and they really are a fit. 
That doesn’t mean that, initially, the customer has to agree with you that the 
purchase is a great idea, but the customer does need to be open and listening 
and you need to be demonstrating your value, so that they come around.
Table 3-2 in ‘Focusing on your customer: Why you should care’ earlier in this 
chapter gives you some questions to think about when mapping your cus-
tomer journey. If you find these questions hard to answer, you may need to 
interview customers, prospects and staff to ask for their thoughts.
You can extend the interviews to partners and others in your business 
circle. If you go to the trouble of asking people for their help, thoughts and 
feedback, you’ll hear things that surprise you. That’s why the exercise is so 
valuable.

And don’t feel bad – every business has gaps and plugging them makes a 
big difference: conversations with prospects become easier and you can see 
more clearly what to do next. You feel powerful about how you’re driving 
your business.
Using influence to get the  
outcome you want
Power is a highly enabling experience. I’m not talking about the sort of power 
that people use to bully others into doing what they want. I’m referring to the 
kind of power where you present yourself and your company in the most com-
pelling, authentic, honest, nothing-hidden way. This form of power is where 
you don’t need to smear the competition to win, or cut your price to a point 
where the business is hardly worth having: with this power the customer is 
your ally, not your adversary. If something goes wrong, you’re attentive and 
respectful and you can powerfully compromise without giving the farm away.
You want every available tool to support you in getting the result you desire. 
As I discuss in the earlier section ‘Understanding what customers need today 
and whether they know it’, some of the most powerful motivations (including 
your own) are hidden needs. You should be using every type of ethical influ-
ence (factors that sway things in your favor) to push customers’ hot buttons.
Imagine that your customers are working in big business, in the C-Suite (that 
is, they reside on the top floor, maybe in those coveted corner offices). Unless 
you’re visiting a social-media company populated by 20-somethings, you prob-
ably wear a business suit, ensure that your shoes are clean and your hair neat. 
If you turn up in a grubby T-shirt and jeans, would they respect you?
	
The fact is that you’re not Warren Buffet and neither am I: you don’t win busi-
ness looking a mess. Give some thought to why that is.
In his seminal book Influence, Robert Cialdini highlights certain types of influ-
ence that make people do what they do. This wide-ranging book is highly rel-
evant to business development. I want to draw your attention to four specific 
influencers on a sale:
	
✓	Liking: People buy from people they like. Prospects who think that you’re 
a jerk don’t buy from you unless they have no other option. More than 
that, people tend to buy from people who are like them: people who 
shares common values, have common aspirations, pursue the same goals. 
If your prospect likes football and is trying to get her kids through college, 
she relates to you if you’re doing the same sorts of things in your life.

 Chapter 3: Diving Inside Your Customer’s Head
	
	Be as like your prospect as possible. If you hate football, that’s okay – 
you can create liking in all sorts of dimensions, down to what you wear, 
the car you drive or the music you like.
	
✓	Authority: If you carry authority in your field, that’s a big influencer. You 
have automatic authority if you’re a CEO, an expert or a person who can 
do things others can’t – or if you’re asked to speak at events, have an 
authoritative blog or are associated with others of high authority.
	
	Look for ways to build authority. Certifications work well, high profile 
business associates are good, hiring top performers who are known for 
their expertise is great.
	
✓	Social proof: People want to do what others do – it gives them comfort 
that they’re making the right decision. You need proof that you’ve created 
results for others and that good, respected companies buy your services 
(they can then say, ‘See, ABC Company hired them, we should too’).
	
	For this reason, recognizable logos and case studies are hugely influential –  
these great companies must know what they’re doing, so customers can 
be safe doing the same.
	
✓	Scarcity: If you think that something may be running out, or not be 
freely available, you value it more. Scarcity is an influence that has 
customers acting faster, paying more money and valuing what they’re 
getting. Don’t be too available. Keep yourself and your services a little 
scarce – it makes you more valuable.
	
	Say things such as ‘We only work with companies that . . . ’, ‘We take on 
three new customers a year; that’s it’ and ‘We can start your work the 
month after next’.
You may want the world to be different, but in the big, bad marketplace, com-
panies are using influence all the time. Influence drives people to act, make 
the choices they make and feel good about those choices. Use influences 
ethically – they’re really powerful.

Using the Lifecycle to Your 
Advantage
In This Chapter

▶	Working on after-sales
I
 
f I say to you ‘the customer is king’, what’s your reaction? You think worry-
ing about the customer is all very well, but you want your moment in the 
spotlight? Well, here’s your chance, because whereas Chapter 3 talks about 
the customer’s perspective, in this one I look at the customer experience 
from your point of view.
I want you to look in detail at your business and ask whether you think that 
your experience of working with customers is enriching or sometimes a 
disaster. I cover how to align your business development with that customer 
experience, helping you to grasp the stages of business development as 
they relate to the customer’s mindset, concerns and goals at every stage. 
Examining your business in this way allows you to develop a customer- 
centric approach to its full potential.
I have complete faith that, after you and the customer shake hands on the 
deal and the contract is in negotiation or about to be signed, you know what 
you’re getting into and the work’s going to go well.
	
Check out Figure 2-1, which represents the customer experience: notice its 
stages, that it has a cyclical nature and that customer experience is a complex 
beast. Dealing with customers at multiple stages in their experience can feel 
like juggling plates – once in a while a plate falls to the ground. Just getting 
a handle on their experience is a major achievement. All the way through, 
you’re balancing the customer’s needs with your own. Start spinning those 
plates!

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
Clarifying Precisely What You’re 
Selling — and How
Your business needs to have its act together to get a sale closed (to sign a 
contract). You’ve already been doing a version of business development in 
your business – I just point out a few useful things to know or try to expand 
your ‘good’ stages and tackle your weaker ones.
	
If you’re inclined to change or collapse the stages in the lifecycle, hold off for 
now. I recommend that you read through Chapters 2 to 6 before rewriting it! If 
you think that a part of the lifecycle is unnecessary and shouldn’t be included, 
the chances are that the part you’re resisting is a weakness in your business – 
worth checking.
Plenty of customers are out there; most of them you’ve never met and 
most you never will. From time to time a prospect appears on your hori-
zon, and you start interacting with this potential customer (or indeed 
with others who take an interest in what you do and may direct you to 
new prospects). When you start this interaction, be clear about how you 
want that interaction to go. That includes knowing what you’re selling: 
it includes your specific services of course, but you’re also delivering 
safety, confidence and peace of mind (see the later section ‘Creating the 
customer experience’). In this sense, you come to appreciate that you’re 
selling more than you think you are.
Being in control
When you’re clear about what you’re selling, you want to think about who 
you’re selling to and how. Controlling the customer experience builds a 
strong, resilient business for you. Take a look at the sidebar ‘Are you in con-
trol?’ Establishing and maintaining control is a recurring topic throughout 
this book.
	
Here’s the scoop. One of the hidden needs of customers is that they want to 
experience a confident, organized service provider that looks like it knows 
what it’s doing.
You may be asking ‘How can I be in control? Surely the customer chooses to 
whether to work with me?’, but you’re probably not saying ‘Be in control? I 
don’t want that!’

 Chapter 4: Using the Lifecycle to Your Advantage
You’re definitely selling your firm’s expertise, your authority as one of the 
leaders in your firm, your track record, your references, your results. That all 
makes sense, right? Thing is, you don’t want to wait for customers to dictate 
the next step: to enquire as to your references, review your case studies or 
ask you for a proposal. You want them to buy immediately into the fact that 
you’re in control of the process. For them, control that’s powerful and author-
itative doesn’t show up as arrogant – it makes them feel safe. They can relax 
and be fully engaged in telling you about their business and their problems, 
instead of trying to figure out whether you’re any good at what you do.
	
When you display competence on day one, it accomplishes three important 
objectives:
	
✓	Customers see that you know what you’re doing.
	
✓	Customers heave a sigh of relief (believe me, they’ve seen plenty of 
incompetence in their time).
	
✓	Customers start to trust you.
Are you in control?
Business is only fun when you’re doing the right 
things for the right customers at the right time. 
The challenge is how you get to that position. 
If your approach is to grab every piece of busi-
ness that walks through the door, chances are 
you’ll never get to that level of fun.
If you want to love your business life, you need 
to design your interaction with prospects and 
customers and not let it be accidental. Flying 
by the seat of your pants causes all sorts of 
problems:
	✓	You look unprepared/unprofessional.
	✓	You lose some of your authority.
	✓	You struggle to establish trust.
	✓	You definitely lose the upper hand.
	✓	You’re not in control.
Being committed to serving your customers 
doesn’t mean that you have to be a punching 
bag. In fact, it means quite the opposite. You 
establish control of the business development 
lifecycle by being clear about what needs to 
happen at every step. Establishing control is 
especially important in the first interaction, 
because you’re setting the tone for the whole 
relationship.
The lion is a powerful animal, but a lion tamer, 
although physically weaker, is a master of 
how to be in control. If you don’t want to get 
eaten for lunch, take control of the customer’s 
experience.
The ultimate goal is to guide the customer 
around the lifecycle (because you know that 
it works). To be that kind of guide, you need to 
train the customer. Have you ever wondered 
why a customer pays some vendors on time and 
not others? It does so because the vendor that 
gets its money on time has trained the customer 
to pay on time. That training starts on day one.
It’s your business. Make sure that you say how 
things should go.

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
If you can achieve this level of authority and control in your first interaction, 
subsequent meetings and discussions go well (as long as you can keep it up – 
that takes planning and lots of practice). People buy from people who seem 
competent and they can trust, and you set yourself up for success.
These interactions are commonly handled amazingly badly. Compare the two 
versions of the same meeting in Table 4-1.
Table 4-1	
The First Customer Interaction (the Good,  
	
the Bad and the Ugly)
The Customer’s in Control
You’re in Control
You come to the meeting knowing next 
to nothing about the customer’s com-
pany or the specific contact.
You’ve done your research and you 
have a good overview of the cus-
tomer’s business, size and how long it’s 
been around. You also know something 
about the contact. You have a sense of 
whether it’s a target customer.
The customer drives the agenda and 
controls how the meeting goes.
You have an agenda. You outline it 
to the customer and get agreement. 
You’re clear about where you expect to 
be at the end of the meeting.
The customer tells you what it thinks 
you need to know about its situation/
need.
You introduce your company very 
briefly, so that the customer immedi-
ately gets the value.
The customer’s hard to interrupt. You 
can’t get a word in.
You ask questions that you need the 
answers to in order to determine 
whether this prospect is one you want 
to work with.
The meeting runs short of time or runs 
long.
You keep an eye on the clock. You 
leave time to cover the vital three items 
below.
Budget is never mentioned.
You talk price. You tell the customer 
what you typically charge. If the repre-
sentatives are still on their chairs, go to 
the next step.
You’re not sure what the customer’s 
buying process is, who to makes the 
decision, who else is involved, who 
signs the contract.
You ask the representatives to outline 
their roadmap to making a decision 
(assuming that you’re in a competitive 
situation). Get the decision-makers’ 
names and roles and understand the 
timeframe.

 Chapter 4: Using the Lifecycle to Your Advantage
The Customer’s in Control
You’re in Control
The meeting ends with no action items 
set, or commitments to next steps.
If you think you’re on to a winner, ask 
whether the representatives are willing 
to entertain the next step (whatever 
that is). If they say yes, let them know 
what you need to happen to move for-
ward. Don’t ever give anything without 
getting something back. (‘Before we 
send you a proposal, let’s set a date 
to review it together – we expect [the 
decision-maker] to be at that meeting.’)
I’m sure that you can see from the table that the customer feels way more 
confident with the approach in column 2 (Chapter 14 has loads more about 
selling under control).
	
If things don’t smell right at the end of that first meeting, walk away (the chap-
ters in Part IV tell you why). Take the same strategy with future meetings.
If you didn’t immediately rush to Part IV (and I wouldn’t have blamed you if 
you had), let me just add one thing. One of my favorite treats as a child was 
those little netted bags with gold chocolate coins. Think of those coins as 
representing you, your customer and the relationship. On one side of the 
chocolate coin is what you’re selling. In big gold letters, it says ‘authority in 
every move you make’. On the other side of the coin is what the customer is 
buying: it says ‘peace of mind’. The chocolate in the middle is ‘mutual confi-
dence and trust’. Oh, I love analogies featuring chocolate!
Keeping your offer fresh
You’re not stuck with your current offer as it is. Your offer has to be relevant 
and flexible, open to small shifts and changes without high risk:
	
✓	Your offer has to serve customer needs as they are today (check out 
Chapter 3 for all about assessing your customers’ real needs).
	
✓	Your offer needs to be current (in the sense of up-to-date) and techni-
cally appropriate: ‘technically’ in the broad sense of your specialized 
knowledge, your methodology, the tools you use and how your service 
gets delivered.

Technology and its impact on services firms
Did you have a car 10 or 20 years ago? When 
you went to have it serviced, way back when, 
it was a different experience. These days car 
service is all computerized, pinpoint diagnosis – 
never mind that cars are just way more reliable 
than they used to be.
I asked a group of CEOs of small businesses 
how technology had changed their businesses 
in the past ten years – changed how they get 
the business and how they deliver on it:

 Chapter 4: Using the Lifecycle to Your Advantage
For an example, read the sidebar ‘Technology and its impact on services 
firms’, which examines how technology (in the narrower sense) has changed 
the offers of a sample of companies over time. The questionnaire for this 
mini-survey is available at www.dummies.com/go/businessdevelopment 
if you want to use it on your own company.
	
In essence, you need to ask how certain forces in the marketplace, including 
the escalating rate of technological change, are impacting your offer, how you 
take it to market and how you deliver it.
	
When you make the decision to change your offer to keep it fresh, extending  
from what you’re already doing makes the most sense. Keep to the path, 
don’t go wandering out into the woods. You’re in a dangerous neighborhood. 
Moving too far away from your core competence starts to confuse the market-
place. I discuss creating or modifying your offer in Chapter 5.
Some people have particularly clear offers (yes, people have offers too – it’s 
not just companies), whereas other people’s offers are rather confusing. Take 
a look on LinkedIn for a few minutes to see what I mean. Perhaps you see a 
person going from studying the History of Art, to becoming a hairdresser, to 
going into marketing and now he’s in a sales role. If you saw that background, 
would you hire that person into sales? No focus, no logic to his career, prob-
ably light on expertise and experience in a number of areas.

Serial entrepreneurs and leaders in society can get away with a richly varied 
profile, but I recommend that you stick to what you do best. I also happen to 
write novels, but I don’t talk about that in my business life – I don’t want to 
dilute my offer. Apply that thought to your business offer and you start creat-
ing a strong reputation.
Investing to stay up-to-date
As your offer changes (as I cover in the preceding section), so does how you 
deliver it. I look at deciding whether your business and its offer is up-to-date 
or not in Chapter 3, but here I describe allocating your resources to take the 
necessary actions to decide what your offer should be today, such as being 
aware of the latest thinking, practices, trends and technologies.
Maintaining your staff’s skills in this context often involves professional 
development, and you need to invest in this area. Table 4-2 shows examples 
of where to place your bets and how to make your investment pay off.

 Chapter 4: Using the Lifecycle to Your Advantage
Your Investment
Accountability of Staff
Keep abreast of current market trends 
and developments.
Share new findings/ideas (typically this 
task is a leadership responsibility, but 
research can also be delegated).
Incorporate all the above into how 
you do business (offer, methods, 
deliverables).
Incorporate any new direction into 
daily business processes.
Don’t forget to keep looking for new staff, too. Interviews are a great way to 
find out what’s new in technology, alternative approaches and so on.
	
If your staff members are out in the wider world keeping up-to-date and shar-
ing what they’re seeing, you have a source of new ideas for your business. You 
want them to be enthusiastic about making a contribution to the business, 
but you also need to be realistic about how much change you can initiate and 
follow through on at any one time.
Creating the customer experience
Beyond just a sale, the customer is buying much more than the services you 
deliver, as I discuss in the earlier section ‘Being in control’. Ultimately, the 
customer is buying the whole experience – every aspect of the interactions 
between you and your customer is part of the deliverable. In the services 
arena, customers depend on your expertise, judgment, objectivity, commu-
nication and warnings. You have the opportunity to be a trusted advisor. You 
also have the potential to let customers down.
Attention to the customer experience journey is critical to ensure that you’re 
lockstep with the customer’s expectations.
	
Compare the two halves of the business development lifecycle in Figure 3-1 
(the part before the contract and the part after) and see what you notice.
All kinds of thoughts may pop up, perhaps things you never noticed before. 
Here is a selection of my ideas:
	
✓	The mood of customers doesn’t stay the same throughout their jour-
ney in looking for and implementing a solution to their need. They 
can go from optimistic, even elated, to depressed, almost despairing 
(especially if their needs have a serious impact on their business or are 
complex to solve).

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
	
✓	A big swing exists from the subjective to the objective in the first part 
of the cycle. In the early stages, anything is possible. The customer’s 
research can be quite wide-ranging, looking at a lot of options, not all 
of which are apples-to-apples comparisons. As they progress round the 
cycle, they start to eliminate possibilities and hone in on what they think 
may work for them, for their situation, for their budget. The move is 
from a subjective enquiry into an objective one, from ‘What might I do?’ 
to ‘What will I do?’.
	
✓	Choosing is decisive. Literally. When they choose you (or anyone), do 
they heave a sigh of relief? Absolutely. They’ve moved from a world of 
uncertainty to one of certainty. Now they know who they’re going to be 
working with. The engagement ring has changed hands.
	
✓	The contract is the pivotal point. This point is where objectivity really 
matters. Customers have to be clear what they’re getting. Any looseness 
at this stage can bite both parties later on.
	
✓	Delivery is an uncertain time. Customers can be unsure what to do 
when the contract is signed. Should they stand back and let you get 
on with it, or do they need to be active and participatory? Should they 
minutely inspect everything, or should they trust you? Are they con-
fused about what’s going on, or clear?
	
✓	What does ‘done’ really mean? You may think you’re done, but does 
the customer? Is this part of the process sometimes a point of disagree-
ment and why is that?
	
✓	What now? Does the customer expect something beyond the delivery, 
such as a post-project review, a thank-you note, a dinner?
	
One person can’t do everything around the customer experience cycle and 
be really good at it all. I’m not just talking about the fact that you’d need to 
be Super(wo)man, but that the stages in the lifecycle require different skill 
sets from your team. Someone who’s good at pitching your services in a live 
presentation to a group of C-level people and fielding their questions isn’t nec-
essarily the person to write your contracts or deliver the work. Try getting a 
project manager to expand his relationships in a key account to see whether 
you can get more business, and you’ll see what I’m talking about.
Key personality traits fit the various stages of the business development life-
cycle, as shown in Table 4-3.
	
When you’re a small company, people who carry multiple roles have strengths 
and weaknesses. No point blaming them for that – it’s how they are. You can 
ameliorate weaknesses, but you can never make, say, a great salesperson out 
of a great bookkeeper.

Self-confident, loves to mingle, relate 
to people, perform. Prefers talking to 
writing. Willing to take risks.
PROPOSE: Served by subject-matter 
experts
Authoritative. Can be arrogant, but 
takes great pride in expert knowledge. 
Cautious about commitment.
CONTRACT: Served by proposal writ-
ers, contract people
Fanatical about detail. Leaves nothing 
up in the air or uncertain. Accounts 
for every possibility (of what may go 
wrong).
DELIVER and COMPLETE: Served by 
subject-matter experts, project and 
account managers
Lives in a task-driven world. Loves lists. 
Can push back quite hard if the cus-
tomer asks for flexibility. Gets the job 
done, no matter what.
EVALUATE and INVENT: Served by 
executives/strategists/visionaries and 
also by quality control, finance people
Interested in the big picture, the broad 
sweep of things, but can also lock onto 
detail. Inspires the customer, but some-
times thinks things can be done more 
easily or quickly than they can. Looks 
for new possibilities and aims to find 
what’s positive. Loves to create new 
business ideas.
By contrast, the quality/finance folks 
are judgmental and number-oriented, 
and are looking for problems and what 
not to do next time and why the CEO’s 
next idea won’t work!
By the way, your customer has a personality too. Check out Chapter 14 for 
how to sell to different job roles and personalities.

Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
Considering the Pre-Sales Stage
From first contact to contract signing, you’re in the phase of the customer 
lifecycle and relationship referred to as pre-sales. Pre-sales is a period of get-
ting to know: dating, courting and making the offer. You want to look your 
best, say the right things at the right time and not mess up.
Selling without looking like you’re selling
Here’s a loaded question: when are you selling and when are you not? Clearly 
you can only close a deal when the customer’s need exists, the time is now 
and the prospect is ready to buy, but the prospect being ready to buy doesn’t 
mean you have to get all ‘salesy’. You may take the viewpoint that you should 
never be selling or the viewpoint that you’re selling all around the lifecycle, 
or something in between. Take whichever viewpoint you want – what’s impor-
tant is that you’re responsible for the customer relationship with your com-
pany throughout the whole lifecycle and for how that ‘feels’ for the customer 
at each stage.
In the end, every relationship is emotional. Customers have sensations 
around their business pains – if these sensations don’t get solved, they’re 
a threat to a person’s view of himself, his career advancement and whether 
he keeps his job. In Chapter 5, you get to turn those threats into value state-
ments for your solution.
	
Imagine that you’re about to buy something. You know that you need it 
and you’re considering what the next steps are. Someone who tries to ‘sell’ 
aggressively is going to fail, because some of the key questions you have 
(such as ‘Do I like the person?’) really matter in services sales. Pushy people 
aren’t likeable. The question that trumps all the others is ‘Do I trust the 
person?’. If the answer is yes, it’s because you’ve proved yourself trustwor-
thy throughout.
Dating the customer: EDUCATE stage
During the EDUCATE stage (see Figure 3-1), obviously the earlier you can 
get in on the conversation, the more influence you have over early judg-
ments and decisions that the prospect is making. This stage is the domain

63
 Chapter 4: Using the Lifecycle to Your Advantage
of marketing – to ensure that you’re well represented in the marketplace 
to your target customers and to bring some influence into their early 
decisions.
You can get this influence in two ways:
	
✓	Analyze where the customer has been looking and see how you can 
insert yourself. The advantage of this method is that the customer is 
already in the lifecycle – just at an early stage. You need to create the 
connection points between your business (and business-development 
activities) and the customer’s lifecycle. This approach takes effort 
and is better suited to companies with some marketing and sales 
resources.
	
✓	Create an offer where the value is immediately evident to anyone 
you talk to. The advantage is that the prospect doesn’t have to be in 
the customer journey or even a target customer at all, but if its reaction 
is ‘Really? You do that?’, you’re in a strong position to determine early 
on whether you can create a need or not. If not, the customer may be 
intrigued enough to refer you to other business contacts, or consider 
you later on. I work on this aspect in Chapter 5.
Take a look at Table 4-4 for where you can have some early influence, for 
where you may already be engaged and for a few additional things to try.

Exerting Early Influence
What Can 
You Use?
When to Use it
When Not to Use it
Cold calling
Your offer is distinctive and offers 
particularly high value at a senior 
level in your customer base.
A good-sized segment of the market 
needs what you offer.
Your target customers need your ser-
vices on a cyclical or ongoing basis 
(that is, they buy with frequency, 
for example if you’re a product 
marketing company and your target 
releases a distinctive product on a 
reasonably regular basis).
Your target contacts are 
bombarded by cold calls 
from companies just like 
yours.
You’re operating in a 
local market (such as a 
town or small city).
The market only 
uses your services in 
specific and/or rare 
circumstances.

What Can 
You Use?
When to Use it
When Not to Use it
Offline event 
participation, 
networking,  
speaker 
engagements
You can identify events where your 
customers may hang out.
You’re willing to consider sponsoring 
or exhibiting at such an event, which 
gives you the right to say hello to 
everyone there.
You have someone who’s really good 
at working a room (relating well to 
people quickly, forming a connection 
that can be followed up on).
You’re a great presenter and people 
come up to you afterwards wanting 
more.
The time provided for 
networking is limited.
The events are attended 
more by vendors than 
customers.
The cost of getting 
more deeply involved is 
prohibitive.
You hate talking to 
strangers, you don’t 
care why they’re there 
and you don’t really 
want to be there either.
You dislike doing pres­
entations to more than 
five people.
Online events
When you can sponsor or have some 
say in the content and audience.
When you get an opportunity to 
present, however briefly, your value 
proposition. Even better if you can 
present some content of value to the 
audience (see next item).
You’re participating, but 
without a specific role 
(such as a presentation 
opportunity) or any influ-
ence on the topics and 
audiences.
Authoritative 
content
The heart of early engagement, great 
content, means that you have some-
thing to say that people want to read 
or listen to (or share with others or 
blog about).
You can provide simple tools that 
help customers who are confused 
during the customer journey.
You can demonstrate exceptional 
results from your work with your cus-
tomers (preferably quantitative, but 
qualitative is good too).
You, or someone in your organization, 
is great at writing content for a spe-
cific audience.
See also social media below.
Your offer is pretty gen-
eral (for example, you’re 
an accounting firm, but 
you don’t have any spe-
cialized services).
Your customer journey 
is simple (as in some-
thing’s broken and the 
customer has to fix it 
right now).

What Can 
You Use?
When to Use it
When Not to Use it
Social media
Your customers can be found online, 
on Twitter, in LinkedIn Groups, even 
on Facebook, or on specialized social 
networks.
They follow specific leaders in your 
area of work or customers who’d buy 
your services.
They follow/read bloggers who are 
expert in your area of work and 
provide objective content to the 
marketplace.
Your customers aren’t 
found on social net-
works such as LinkedIn 
(especially the specific 
people you want to con-
nect with).
The cost of buying into 
their network (e.g., 
becoming a Vistage 
member or joining a vir-
tual executive roundta-
ble group) is prohibitive.
Social events/
non-profits/
community 
efforts
Unless the gig is incredibly noisy, 
social and community events are a 
great place to practice your pitch and 
get others interested in what you do. 
Most people work for one company 
or another – you never know.
The people around 
you aren’t in the right 
networks to provide 
the referrals you need. 
Keeping the conversa-
tion social is fine – just 
keep looking for a suit-
able opportunity. Some 
organizations also 
prohibit promoting your 
business, in which case, 
respect that.
Email 
marketing
You have compelling content that the 
prospect can sign up to receive, or 
good content for a regular informa-
tional newsletter.
Blasting out to large 
numbers of people who 
haven’t asked for your 
communication (which 
is illegal).
Don’t waste time seeking out quick fixes to broaden your customer base 
(believe me, none exist!). Chapters 10 and 11 in Part III provide thoughts on 
developing and executing on your marketing tactics – to ensure that you’re 
picking the right things to do that are appropriate to your stage of develop-
ment as a company and to what’s going to attract the prospects.
Courting and proposing: PRESENT 
and PROPOSE stages
You’re in the PRESENT and PROPOSE stages of Figure 3-1 here. Deep into the 
sales process, you’re building the customer relationship – extending it from 
the person you initially spoke with towards other important players on the 
www.ebook777.com

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
66
Part I: Getting Started with Business Development 
customer team and your own. Mostly, customers want to know that you’re 
not the only person in the company who knows what he’s doing, unless 
you’re a one-person shop (in which case, tag, you’re it).
Customers want to be able to trust everyone and to use you as an escalation 
point. You don’t want to show up as a bottleneck. You also want to know the 
players on their side – who’s going to make the decision, how will others 
influence that decision, who will you be working with day-to-day if you move 
ahead with this deal and who needs to be in a relationship with whom?
At a minimum, you want three roles in your company represented, even if 
these roles are combined into one or two people. Here’s who to bring to the 
party from your side:
	
✓	The lead for the sale (sales person/account manager)
	
✓	The lead for the work (project manager or other senior expert)
	
✓	The lead for the customer relationship (account manager/account 
manager)
If you’re the business owner, don’t dominate the conversations. Allow your 
team members to show their strengths and speak for themselves. Prepare 
for customer meetings in advance, especially if your team hasn’t worked in 
this way before. Start to plan out who’s going to take care of what. Teamwork 
at this stage helps the transition to the actual work go smoothly, something 
customers like.
Maintain control of the sales process using the same approach I discuss ear-
lier in the ‘Being in Control’ section (see Chapter 14 for the deep dive).
	
Your aim as you work on the relationship during the sales process is to give 
the customer peace of mind and to instill trust. Even if you never do business 
with this particular prospect, your reputation in the marketplace is built piece-
by-piece from every encounter you ever have with people outside your com-
pany (and inside it, come to that). My favorite comment from a prospect is, ‘I 
hope one day I’ll be big enough to afford you.’ Don’t you just love it when they 
say things like that?
Confronting reality: CONTRACT stage
You’ve got to the CONTRACT stage of Figure 3-1, the halfway point. Well done!
The first half of the customer lifecycle goes from ‘everything is possible’ 
to ‘this is what we’re actually going to do’ – a move from the subjective, 
happy-clappy, aren’t we such good friends, to a serious, contractual business 
relationship. Rather like negotiating a pre-nuptial agreement, moving from 
proposal to starting work is a tough transition. I tell customers that this stage 

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
67
 Chapter 4: Using the Lifecycle to Your Advantage
is the low point in the relationship, but that it gets better when we start to 
work together. Just know that you have to deal with it – you can’t shy away 
or compromise to your own disadvantage. I provide more tips on this stage in 
Chapter 14.
	
Contracts are an important part of the customer’s experience of you. Don’t 
do business without one. At the very least, you need something in writing and 
signed by the customer that captures what you’re going to do, what they’re 
going to do, what they get and what you’re going to be paid and when. This 
contract is one of your most important control mechanisms. If you start work 
without that agreement, you lose your leverage and regaining it is difficult.
Handling the After-the-Sale Process
You’re in, you’re trusted. Just as in the pre-sales phase in the preceding sec-
tion, you want to set the tone for the relationship and continue to manage the 
customer relationship with care and attention.
	
I don’t mean diving in and doing all the work for the customer (unless you’re 
a one-person business). I mean that someone needs to be responsible for 
the relationship and for taking the temperature of the customer from time to 
time – call them the account manager (which could, of course, be you). If pos-
sible, this person should be separate from the person managing the work – the 
project manager. The attention of the account manager is different from a proj-
ect manager. Salespeople often take on the account manager role, but review 
Chapter 13 while considering whether that’s a good idea.
Ongoing customer relationship management has all kinds of benefits and I 
cover how to garner those in Part V.
Moving from ‘Yes’ to ‘Done’: 
DELIVER stage
You’re at the DELIVER stage. Only you know the detail of what happens when 
your business is delivering its services, but customers often get a feeling 
of abandonment by the people they’ve met from your company (and have 
come to trust), into the hands of a stranger (no doubt competent, but not yet 
trusted). Transitioning from the first part of the customer experience to the 
second part is a delicate maneuver. Someone needs to be responsible for that 
transition, and time spent on finessing this move saves you oodles of grief 
later on.

Here are some general guidelines that are the responsibility of the account 
manager in the second half of the customer lifecycle:
	
✓	Understand the scope of the work/do a handover. Make sure that your 
team has a firm grip on the contract, its terms, the scope of the work, 
what the customer is supposed to be providing, contributing or doing, 
what the deliverables are, what the process is for engaging with the cus-
tomer and who’s going to be involved on the customer side. Prepare for 
a kick-off meeting with the customer.
	
✓	Lead or attend the kick-off meeting. The purpose is to go through, with 
the customer, what you just went through in the handover meeting. 
Getting the scope clear, how the work will proceed, what the timeframe 
is, who does what and when. In simple projects, this doesn’t take long, 
but it helps get everyone aligned. On longer projects you encounter 
clear phases to the work, points of sign-off by the customer that it’s sat-
isfied. Involve the account manager at these points, and make sure that 
the sign-off is obtained and that the kick-off for the next phase is just as 
effective as the initial one. Above all, check in with the customer on how 
things are going.
	
✓	Make the project manager your friend. Project managers are incredibly 
focused – they’re totally committed to getting the job done on time and 
within budget. Good for them – where would you be without them? At 
times, the project manager is going to have problems. Make yourself his 
trusted advisor. If issues exist, you want to know about them so that you 
can support the project manager and/or take corrective action with the 
customer or your own management. Set up a regular meeting with the 
project manager, or attend internal project management meetings.
	
✓	Continue the courtship throughout. Send customers useful information 
from time to time, make an occasional call to see how things are pro-
ceeding and take them to lunch. Express interest in their perceptions of 
how things are going on the project. Do they want to say anything? Give 
them the space to do so.
Customer management is the most underused method for expanding your 
business. That’s why I dedicate the whole of Part V to the topic.
Wrapping up delivery: COMPLETE 
and EVALUATE stages
You’ve arrived at COMPLETE. You need to tie up all loose ends – and get the 
customer to sign off that you’re done and to pay you that final invoice.

 Chapter 4: Using the Lifecycle to Your Advantage
	
Here’s where companies leave gold on the table: they don’t follow through to 
get customer feedback. Eager though you may be to get to the next job, spend 
time with the customer in a structured interview process. Make this review 
meeting separate from the final meeting with the delivery team.
You’re bound to uncover opportunities for new business with this customer: 
get permission to use it as a reference or to build a case study, testimonial 
or press release; get introduced to another part of the organization or to 
contacts it has and can refer you to. You also get feedback on the project and 
how it went – what the customer liked about working with you, what it didn’t 
like or would’ve appreciated more of, how to improve your relationship with 
it – and with other customers. See Chapter 17 for details on maximizing your 
customer’s feedback and value to you.

’d like you to take a moment to picture business-development heaven 
(clouds and harps optional). Imagine that every one of your customers 
is as good as your best customer – that your work delights them. It also 
inspires you and your team to leap out of bed every day, impatient to get on 
with the work. Wouldn’t that be gre at? Does it have to remain a dream?
Not at all! The key to living this sort of life is ensuring that you align your 
offer with what the market wants. Don’t worry about customers who want 
something that your company doesn’t provide. That’s not your problem.
	
To run a successful and profitable business, all you need are enough custom-
ers who want what you do and are willing to pay a fair price for it.
The process I describe in this chapter helps you to create your market offer 
and to design how to take it to the market and deliver it. I offer valuable 
insights into the high-level dos and don’ts. Please make the effort to answer 
all the questions in this chapter and perhaps consider doing some role-
playing or working with a trusted advisor. Believe me, the efforts you put in 
here pay off when you’re planning in Chapter 6 and actioning in Chapter 7.
Developing an Offer that Sells
The business development lifecycle gives you a tool for managing the 
growth of your business, making you think clearly about what your cus-
tomers want and how to give it to them. As a result you can fend off the

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
challenges of the marketplace, which are sure to assail you whether you 
like it or not.
You can only grow your business if you wrap your services into an engine 
that can deliver new customers and new projects. In this section I ask you 
to look deeply at, focus on and effectively convey your offer. I also discuss 
making your chosen specialty really special, to trump the competition.
You’re in the INVENT (or, if you prefer, ‘reinvent’) stage of the business devel-
opment lifecycle (Figure 3-1). How do you invent an offer? In this section, I 
cover a few important considerations and give you tools for inventing your 
offer.
I want to start with a quick exercise that takes you back to the early days of 
your company.
	
Why did you start your business or become involved in it?
Do you have:
	
✓	Specialized skills that you wanted to bring to the marketplace (you’re a 
subject matter expert)?
	
✓	Business skills that can support the growth and development of a busi-
ness (you have business development skills)?
	
✓	Entrepreneurial skills (you know how to build a business)?
Any one of these skills can be the genesis of a fine business leader. All skills 
are valuable, but the most valuable to the market, and hence to your pros-
pects and customers, is the application of deep domain knowledge (what you 
know that the customer doesn’t) to the solution of business problems (the 
needs of the customers).
	
Everything else your business needs to do is centered on your offer and how 
you:
	
✓	Make the market aware of the needs you fulfill
	
✓	Conduct powerful interactions with prospects to have them buy from 
you, instead of from the other guy
	
✓	Do the work
	
✓	Leverage your happy customers, that is, use successful projects as the 
basis for business expansion
	
If you’re a business owner, you have a different perspective from a leader of 
business development. That’s okay. Sharing what you’re uncovering from 
those different perspectives doesn’t hurt at all.

 Chapter 5: Getting Ready for Business Development
Ensuring that you’re giving 
the market what it needs
	
If your offer doesn’t take care of a customer need, it’s not going to sell. People 
buy because they need or want something.
Specializing
Imagine this scenario: It’s morning, I need a coffee. Coffee has low value – 
technically, you can make it yourself. You can also visit an abundance of places 
to get coffee. The market’s hugely competitive and has heavy price pressure. 
But people are willing to pay a ridiculous amount for an individually crafted 
coffee. I can buy a cup for coffee in the garage for $1 (63p), but I wait in line 
at Starbucks for 20 minutes to pay $3 (£1.89). Tuck that thought in your back 
pocket.
I’m not suggesting that you open a coffee shop, but rather that you need to 
uncover what’s high value to the market so that you can charge more. Coffee 
isn’t always coffee – sometimes it’s an experience.
Here’s another example. Say that I just invented a device that can help people 
keep their cholesterol low. I’m going to be rich! I need a patent lawyer, because 
I know ‘I can’t do this, I don’t know anything about patenting.’ Plus, lots of 
patent lawyers are around, patent law is complex and so are the products that 
get patented. The lawyers don’t just know how to create and file a patent with 
the patents and trademarks office. They also have to understand their clients’ 
area of business – they specialize. They may represent healthcare inventions, 
or software, or manufacturing equipment or any other area of business you 
can name. The deeper their specialization, the more value they are to me, 
their customer.
	
Specialization is valuable, so you need to consider it carefully for your busi-
ness. Four results arise from firms’ increased specialization:
	
✓	Their knowledge becomes deeper.
	
✓	They’re more valuable to their customers.
	
✓	They’re scarcer (less competition and limited availability).
	
✓	They can charge more.
Although the market you have if you’re highly specialized is smaller than if you 
offer something more general (more widely applicable), a more focused offer is 
easier to position and harder for the customer to resist. Why would a customer 
go to a lawyer who knows nothing about their space and risk something going 
wrong? Specialists can point to those risks, have probably seen them happen 
and can justify why the customer should work with them and pay more.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
Breakdowns
Time to take a deeper dive into what starts the buying process for customers – 
breakdowns. My thanks go to Influence Ecology, an education company, for 
teaching me everything I know about breakdowns. Its definition of breakdowns 
is as follows:
A breakdown is the collapse of function and/or continuance in taking care 
of an immediate or future concern. A breakdown means that life, as we 
know it, is or is about to be out of balance.
Simply put, a breakdown is something not working. It causes a need that cre-
ates an opportunity for a solution, aka your offer.
	
You can sell an offer to a customer in two situations:
	
✓	The customer has a current breakdown in its business and knows that 
the breakdown exists and that it has to act. In you go.
	
✓	You can also point to a potential breakdown that the customer (a) doesn’t 
even know it has today (it’s hidden), or (b) one that’s coming tomorrow 
(the customer doesn’t see it coming). With the right offer, you can create 
a need in the customer’s mind.
Luckily(!), the world contains plenty of breakdowns, though not all are opportu-
nities for profitable businesses. I have at least five business plans that solve real 
and common breakdowns but clearly wouldn’t work for any one of a number 
of reasons (for example, the offer isn’t specialized enough, the market isn’t big 
enough, the market price is too low or needs too much capital to start).
	
For all kinds of reasons, many people are picky about what they eat. The break-
down is that, wherever you are, you’re presented with things you shouldn’t 
eat. I had an idea some years ago for a restaurant where you profile your needs 
and dietary restrictions and the menu is customized for you with only the 
things you can eat. Great idea, but I have no specialized knowledge in running 
restaurants.
	
Based on the True Story, think about your own company and note down what 
your customer’s breakdown is, how you’d describe your customer’s need and 
what offer you can make to solve that breakdown/fulfill that need. Don’t over-
think this situation right now. Write no more than three short sentences.
Now, if you’re the customer with that need, do you buy your company? Are 
you, the customer, convinced that your firm’s offer solves the need? Do you 
feel the urgency to act right away, or are you willing to ‘think about it’, ‘talk 
to my business partner about it’, ‘look around’ – in other words procras-
tinate like Hamlet on an indecisive day. How confident are you that, faced 
with a customer that has the right breakdown and need, she would buy your

 Chapter 5: Getting Ready for Business Development
services, and quickly. If your prospects don’t seem that bothered, you want 
to examine why.
One of the things services firms complain about is that customers are slow to 
act. Here are a few reasons for their reluctance:
	
✓	The need is one of many problems they have to solve (and the problem 
you solve isn’t top of the stack today).
	
✓	They worry about different things today than they did yesterday, and so 
even if they start a promising conversation with you, their priorities are 
constantly shifting.
	
✓	They’re totally overwhelmed (short on staff, trying to do everything at 
once).
	
✓	They know that they’re going to have to put effort into the project and 
they’re worried that they may not have the time – engaging with you 
actually produces more work for them for a while. Doing nothing and 
living with the problem can look like a viable option.
	
✓	Your offer just isn’t compelling (imperative) enough for the prospect to 
take action, right now (that’s the donkey kick).
	
Yuck, I know, but look anyway. Some suggestions for how to deal with this list 
are below. If you’re having problems closing new customers, you need to 
reconsider your offer, or at least how you position it and to whom.
	
As you write down your customers’ needs, look for the imperative. If you can’t 
feel it, or it’s a bit wishy-washy, spice it up (see the next section). The market 
hungers for solutions that solve imperative needs: keeping up with the latest 
fashion trend, getting your water tank fixed or looking for consulting advice on 
fending off new, aggressive competitors.
Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it’s an imperative!
If the water tank in your attic starts leaking a 
ton of water into the bedroom ceiling, which 
is bulging and threatening to collapse, you 
don’t procrastinate. The need is imperative 
and propels you into immediate action (faster 
than Superman can find a phone box). You 
can hang about (checking that your superhero 
underpants are neatly on outside your fetching 
tights) and wait until the ceiling collapses, but 
common sense tells you that this problem is just 
going to get worse if you wait. That’s what an 
imperative looks like.
To sell quickly and successfully, customers 
have to understand the consequences of inac-
tion and experience how serious that would be. 
When they get the full impact, they’re primed 
to buy.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
Making your specialty really valuable
You know that old expression, ‘It’s not what you do, it’s the way that you 
do it’? My version is, ‘It’s not what you do, it’s how you position it.’ But 
don’t worry. I’m not about to go all fluffy marketing speak on you. Quite the 
opposite.
Services firms struggle to articulate their unique value. Maybe you’re think-
ing, ‘My offer isn’t unique’, and you’re right, it probably isn’t. But when you 
can draw out the value to the customer and express it in the most compelling 
way, your offer can look unique, even if it isn’t.
	
If you create your offer to look unique, you start to deliver it as if it is.
	
Don’t fall into the trap that some firms make, when they say that they do some-
thing ‘miraculous’ but in the hurly burly of doing the work forget to check that 
they’ve fulfilled on ‘miraculous’. A common example is when firms talk about 
developing ‘strategy’ and continuing to keep an eye out for the customer but 
quickly devolve into delivering on tactics and so lose their strategic hold on 
the customer. The result is disappointed customers, because they’re not get-
ting what they expected. They say things like ‘you do really great work, but . . .’.
You need to create a value proposition, expressed as an inspiring positioning 
(a description of your services that declares the extra-special value). Two 
things can happen when you do that (one great, one bad): your organization 
is right behind the positioning and lives out that promise every day – or you 
do something like the example above (strategy declining into tactics) and the 
promise isn’t fulfilled in practice.
	
If you’re going to get big with your promises, you better align the rest of your 
organization to follow through. Your task is to take a need, known or hidden 
(one the prospect doesn’t know it has), make it an imperative need (often 
called a ‘pain’ or ‘business pain’) and state the value of the solution as a busi-
ness concept that you can present to a prospect, in other words, as an offer.
	
When buying solutions, much of the purchase is emotional, driven by survival. 
This exercise digs into that emotion. Follow these steps and answer these 
questions about your customer’s needs and your value:
	
1.	Write down your offer (as you expressed it earlier in the Try This 
exercise in the earlier ‘Breakdowns’ section).
	
2.	Ask yourself: which individual do you sell to in the customer orga-
nization? Whose pain is the greatest? What’s this person’s role? Who 
really needs what you’ve got?

 Chapter 5: Getting Ready for Business Development
	
	 If you have more than one answer (for example, head of HR may say one 
thing, chief operations officer another, general counsel something else), 
pick the role of your most common customer contact, the one who most 
often consumes your services and keep just that person in mind as you 
answer the rest of the questions.
	
3.	How would that person describe her pain/need? Start your answer 
with ‘I can’t . . .’, ‘I don’t trust . . .’, ‘I’m afraid that . . .’, ‘I panic when . . .’ 
and the like.
	
4.	What’s the consequence of the answer in Step 3 for the customer’s 
business? For example, ‘We might not . . .’, ‘It could result in . . .’, ‘We 
won’t be able to . . .’, ‘We might lose . . .’.
	
5.	What are the emotions associated with the things you write down in 
Step 3? Is it fear, panic, feeling incompetent, helpless? The customer 
would say, ‘I feel . . .’.
	
6.	What are the opposite emotions? What would the person be feeling if 
the problem was solved: for example, fear becomes confidence. The cus-
tomer would say ‘Now I feel . . .’.
	
7.	How does your service address the pain and the emotion? ‘We do . . .’, 
‘The results are . . .’, ‘You’ll feel . . .’.
	
8.	What’s the benefit of your solution to the business of the customer 
and to this individual’s emotional state? ‘You’ll be able to . . .’, ‘You’ll 
stop . . .’.
	
9.	What would your contact say about her situation if she had the solu-
tion already in place. ‘I’m really . . .’.
	
10.	Restate your offer.
Big task, right? What shifted for you in your view of your offer? Are your 
people capable of delivering on that restated offer?
	
Jack had a thriving product design company. Firms came to him to work their 
ideas up into market-ready offerings. The problem was that over time, he did 
less work on envisioning the products and more on designing the marketing of 
the products. When he rethought his offer, he was able to craft a new position-
ing for his value – to help people practically with ideas to create a better prod-
uct, not just a better-positioned one.
Can you see your own value more clearly, more strongly, after answering the 
questions? If you can, great, keep refining it. Do the same exercise on a differ-
ent role in the customer organization. Each time you repeat the process, you 
may find new value you didn’t know you had. These aspects are key things to 
know when you’re selling.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
	
If you find this exercise hard, try doing it with someone else – a trusted busi-
ness friend or a key person in your organization. Think about the hidden 
needs of the customer representative – the things that are going on in her 
head but she doesn’t articulate. Dig deep into what the customer is thinking 
and experiencing.
Assessing your competition
If you don’t know who you’re competing with, you better find out pretty 
darned quick (I touch on competition in Chapter 4).
	
Try to uncover what competing firms think their value is, but you won’t find 
doing so easy. Most companies articulate their positioning (the needs they 
fulfill on, the offer they have) badly, with even their websites often giving little 
clue as to what they actually do! Seeing just how badly some companies pres-
ent to the marketplace is a salutary lesson. Don’t make the same mistake.
The good news is that you can do it better; the bad news is that you don’t 
really know what competitors are saying to prospects, what they’re promis-
ing and what they’re saying about you or companies like you, unless your 
prospects tell you.
	
At a minimum, profile your competition and start a dossier on each one you’ve 
recently lost business to. If the timing is good, ask some recent losses what 
caused them to choose another firm. Tell them that you’re reworking your 
positioning and that their input can really help. They’ll take the call. People 
love to be helpful, especially when they can tell you what’s wrong with you!
If the loss was just that the other firm did something better than you in 
the sales process, take note and use that in planning your sales process in 
Chapter 13. However, if the loss was price, better fit or (heaven be praised) 
higher value, great, you’re onto something.
	
You shouldn’t be losing on price. If you do, you probably didn’t do one of two 
things:
	
✓	Walk away early enough: In other words, the customer wanted cheap-
est, not best. If your positioning is ‘we’re the cheapest’, that’s fine, but 
then you wouldn’t have lost on price.
	
✓	Get your unique value across: Doesn’t necessarily mean the value 
doesn’t exist, just that the competitor did a better job of creating a value 
proposition (‘if you hire us, you get this specific value’).
Consider carefully how to beat the competition. You need a value proposition 
that steps to the outer edges where competitors can’t go and to position a 
compelling value story that speaks to the customer’s emotional needs.

 Chapter 5: Getting Ready for Business Development
In the earlier section ‘Ensuring that you’re giving the market what it needs’, 
I say that customers are sometimes slow to act, even with a high imperative, 
because they can’t see how they’d dedicate the time or resources to work 
with you. If you, hypothetically, can take a lot of that burden off their shoul-
ders and minimize the commitment they have to make, that can have value 
for them – as long as they are involved in key information transfer and key 
decisions along the way. If you’re talking to the right prospects, they quite 
possibly would pay for it.
	
How much would you pay for a new website: $5,000 (£3,150), $50,000 (£31,500), 
$500,000 (£315,000) or even more? These prices represent different value prop-
ositions, in terms of what gets delivered and whether it’s effective and in how 
the work gets done. The value has to match the price unless you’re in the envi-
able position of being able to charge whatever you want.
Accepting that the grass  
isn’t always greener
When business is great, when lots of prospects are a good fit for your offer 
and when you’re running at 100 miles an hour to keep up with the growth, 
you probably don’t spend much time gazing over the fence at the next field.
If business is tight, if you’re losing a lot and if you’re beginning to doubt 
whether you have the right offer, even an innocent question from a cus-
tomer or prospect along the lines of ‘Do you do so-and-so?’ can make you 
wonder whether, even though you don’t do so-and-so, easy money is out 
there.
	
The correct answer is, ‘No, we don’t do that.’ Better still, ‘. . . but we can refer 
you to someone we trust completely’. If you’re tempted to say ‘yes’, thinking 
that you must get money in the door somehow, stop, at least long enough to 
read this section.
Considering adding services to your offer can be tempting. From your posi-
tion, that company in the next field seems to have lots of business in that so-
and-so service area. Apparently, a lot of demand exists for that service out in 
the marketplace.
When you eye a new service offer to consider whether you should be doing 
that too, doing so is called diversification, namely offering something different 
than you do today. The thinking is that offering different types of services is a 
hedge against one area not doing so well.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
If you’re General Electric, with billions in the bank (I’m just guessing here, I 
know nothing), you can afford to diversify. If you make a bad move, you can 
just back off while the rest of your empire is humming along. But you’re prob-
ably not GE, and so behaving like you are is a bad idea.
	
If you’re tempted to grow by expanding your services, the following is a list of 
reasons why that may not be a good idea. If expanding still looks like a good 
idea after considering these items, by all means go for it. Just don’t jump in 
naively thinking you’re going to find any kind of quick fix:
	
✓	You’re in a panic. One or two customers asked you for ‘so-and-so’ and 
you start to wonder whether offering that would maybe be a fix to your 
near-term revenue problem, maybe even bring you lots of new business.
	
✓	You think that more business is ‘over there’. That other field may 
look greener, but it’s not. Walk over and see. The field is full of mud and 
stones – more brown than green! Talk to someone in that business who 
offers those services and ask whether it’s really so easy. If the area is 
highly lucrative, you can bet on a lot of competition – you’re the newbie 
and you’re likely to lose a lot before you win, maybe even your shirt 
(and it’s chilly out there!).
	
✓	You think you can do that service. You probably know something about 
what it would take to become a so-and-so company. The problem is that 
what you don’t know probably outweighs what you do.
	
✓	You think you can slide into it quite easily. Likely not. You have to 
retool a lot of stuff: train or hire staff, create a new methodology, invest 
in new tools, create a whole new offer (market positioning, presenta-
tions, proposals, contract formats, and on and on). Starting a new ser-
vice area can be a major distraction, a real money sink, and can even 
take your business down.
	
✓	You think you can create a product. This one’s a real gem for services 
firms. If your service (or a part of it) lends itself to productization (such 
as a book, a training course, a do-it-yourself process, a software solu-
tion), unless you’ve done productization before, take it from me, you 
know next to nothing about what it takes. Services business is extremely 
flexible, you can shift and change it, compensate for any shortcoming 
or minor customer dissatisfaction. Products are nothing like that – they 
stand or fall on providing enough value ‘out of the box’ to compensate 
for any deficiency in the product. Before you consider it, talk to people 
in services who’ve tried to productize an aspect of their businesses. Ask 
them how it went.
	
The bottom line is that fixing what you have is the fastest route to growth. 
When your business is performing and you have capital to invest in a new 
offer and time to dedicate to shepherding it through, go for it. Don’t try it 
when your business is struggling, cash flow is tight and you’re already working 
12-hour days. Tread warily.

 Chapter 5: Getting Ready for Business Development
Developing focus – or it’s all over
Al Ries has written a great book called Focus (Harper Business): when you’ve 
read this book, read that one. It’s excellent. You’ll discover that customers 
really appreciate narrow and deep expertise. In fact, over time, even your 
deep domain knowledge becomes more like general knowledge and you have 
to adapt.
Take the example of www.legalzoom.com. Once upon a time people had to go 
to lawyers for contract documents, now they can just use the Internet. But that 
presents a problem for lawyers: what do they do to survive? They have to go 
deeper into areas of legal complexity that the general public have no chance of 
understanding from a casual review of an article on www.about.com.
	
When you can say, ‘We do this and nothing else, but we’re the best’ (and I 
mean the absolute best), you’re in a powerful position. Single-minded focus is 
the key to small-business success (check out the sidebar ‘Just call me Adair, 
Red Adair’).
‘Really? You do that?’ Articulating  
your offer
Imagine meeting famous fire-fighter Red Adair at a cocktail party (now that 
dates me!) – read the sidebar ‘Just call me Adair, Red Adair’. What would his 
offer have been like? Perhaps it was, ‘I put out oil well fires, guaranteed.’ Your 
reaction may be, ‘Really? You do that? Tell me more.’
That phrase comes from my friend, Kirkland Tibbels, President of Influence 
Ecology, and it’s a great test for your positioning statement. When you tell 
people what you do, you’re after that ‘tell me more’ reaction.
So if I say to you ‘I’m the CEO of HRFixIt and we’re an HR consulting com-
pany’, you can be forgiven for changing the subject or going to talk to some-
one more interesting. But if I say ‘I’m the CEO of HRFixIt. We help you not get 
sued when you terminate staff’, you may say, especially if you have employ-
ees, ‘Really? How? Tell me more.’
Kirkland calls it agitation. People don’t act unless you agitate them with an 
impending threat – in the case of the HR company, ‘Yes, you could get sued. 
Want to insure against that?’
	
Take a look at your offer and value proposition and see whether you can 
rewrite it to get the response, ‘Really? You do that? Tell me more.’

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
Of course, having something pithy to say at a cocktail party is one thing, but 
taking that principle and driving a sale with it is quite another. Read the next 
section to discover how.
Presenting Your Offer
After your firm has built a great offer statement (see the earlier section 
‘Developing an Offer that Sells’), you need to know who to take it to. In this 
section, I discuss finding out who and where your customers are, as well as 
engaging successfully with them as you approach a sale.
	
Defining your target market (types, sizes, location and profile of customers) 
saves you masses of time. It allows you to disengage quickly when the pros-
pect doesn’t fit the profile. As the saying goes, ‘just say no’. Doing so may be 
really hard, especially when you’re short of business, but is key to building the 
business you want. Don’t work with customers your offer isn’t built for.
Working with the right customers – those that your offer is specifically 
designed for – is the pathway to growth and success.
Finding your customer
	
To discover whether you have a definition of your target customers, answer 
any of the following questions that are relevant to your business:
Just call me Adair, Red Adair
Oil well fires are the devil’s own job to put out. It 
can take weeks or months and is dangerous – 
plus the fire is polluting and millions of dollars 
are lost. Red Adair was the Ninja Master of oil 
well fires. In fact his name became synonymous 
with the task of putting oil well fires out.
Naturally, Red was able to charge huge bucks, 
because his fee was relatively trivial com-
pared with the impact of the fire continuing. If 
companies decided not to hire him (because 
someone else was cheaper), they sometimes 
regretted it later. They had to come back, tail 
between their legs, and ask him to help them. 
He got out in the field (himself) and nailed that 
sucker. It was awesome to behold. He worked 
well into old age. Check out the website (just 
search for ‘Red Adair’) or documentary pro-
grams about him.

✓	Are they local, regional, national or international?
	
✓	What size are they in revenue and number of employees?
	
✓	What types of companies are they (for profit, non-profit, public sector)?
	
✓	What industries are they in?
	
✓	What roles do you work with in these target companies?
	
✓	What specific need do they have?
	
✓	What budget do they have?
	
✓	What would have them need you now where they haven’t up to this point?
At this point, you should be able to fill in the sentence ‘We work with . . .’. You 
can append this sentence to your offer statement – the one that starts ‘We 
do . . .’ or ‘We help companies . . .’. For example, ‘I’m the CEO of HRFixIt. We help 
you not get sued when you terminate staff. We work with companies smaller 
than 100 employees where legal action could ruin their business.’ Da, da!
With data about companies that fit your profile to hand, you can find out a lot 
more about these organizations and their business people.
	
Pick 100 companies that you want to do business with and create a company 
initiative to do the research. Using data sources such as Bloomberg, Inside 
View, Data.com, LinkedIn and a myriad of others, you can find out what’s 
important to them right now, who just joined the company, who’s left and how 
you may be able to network to get to the right contact.
Undertaking this kind of project moves you from reactive to proactive busi-
ness development. Proactivity is a source for getting the business you want. 
Check out Chapter 2 for why proactivity is so important.
	
Although you can buy lists of companies of the right profile and contacts with 
the right roles for relatively little money, please don’t do that and then start 
blasting them with emails. Doing so is illegal. You need to become somewhat 
familiar with anti-spam legislation (check out Chapter 11).
‘Tell me what you want, what 
you really, really want’
As well as a clear statement of how your services help customers, be ready 
with a barrage of answers to questions from your prospects. As with exam 
preparation, study upfront to succeed on the day. No surprise that you’re in 
the PRESENT stage of the lifecycle (see Figure 3-1).

Build your own story that stands out from your competition. Study your com-
petitors, but don’t mimic them. Prospects buy the solution that resonates best 
with them, whether that solution is articulated by a competitor, by you or by 
the customer’s internal team (as in, ‘We can do that ourselves’). Closely align 
your offer with the customer need and you win more often.
The prospect’s head is full of questions such as the following:
	
✓	What’s my need?
	
✓	Can it be solved and, if so, how?
	
✓	What are my options?
	
✓	How much can I expect to pay?
	
✓	Who can I talk to for good advice?
	
✓	Do they seem to understand my issue?
	
✓	Are they interested in me and what I want?
	
✓	Am I learning things I didn’t know? Do I need to account for those?
	
✓	Do they seem to know what they’re doing?
	
✓	Can they articulate the solution? Do I understand what they’re saying 
to me?
	
✓	Do I have questions? Can they answer my questions to my satisfaction?
	
✓	Can the budget and timeframe work?
	
✓	What do their customers have to say about them?
	
✓	Do I want to work with them?
	
✓	Do I feel safe?
	
✓	Do I trust them?
	
✓	Are they my best, my safest, my right choice?
Think about each of these questions ready for when they come up in the 
buying cycle – they’re not always overt. When they do arise, make sure that 
you have an answer.
	
Great salespeople are worth the big bucks because they have the antennae to 
pick up on customers’ states of mind and provide the right information just 
when, or even better, just before prospects know they need it.

Who drives the customer? 
Engaging effectively
In Chapter 4, I discuss control when you’re setting the customer relationship 
tone for a first meeting. Take a look at Table 4-1 and think about what would 
create effective engagement in your own situation.
	
As you move from PRESENT to PROPOSE in Figure 3-1, consider this scenario: 
you’ve had a first conversation with a prospect that’s in a fix, needs your 
services, has budget and is buying now. You did a great job of defining next 
actions and getting commitment from the prospect to co-operate in the pro-
cess. The firm asks for a proposal. Yaay!
You have an appointment set for reviewing your proposal. Some new people 
from the prospect are going to be in the room/on the call/in the web meeting. 
Consider these questions:
	
✓	Who from your side is going to be in the meeting? What role do you want 
each to play?
	
✓	Are all players on your team in sync and do they fully understand the 
prospect’s business problem, needs and proposed solution?
	
✓	Who are the prospect’s people? What are their names and titles? Can you 
surmise their interest, their concerns, their questions, their objections?
	
✓	How are you going to introduce your company and what it does?
	
✓	How are you going to present your proposal?
	
✓	How are you going to field questions?
	
✓	How can you manage the time so that everything gets covered?
	
✓	How can you allow enough time for next actions and commitments to be 
confirmed?
The reality is that customer meetings can be rather different from your plan. 
I always prefer to do this second meeting to propose something in person, 
but only if I’m guaranteed that the decision-maker is going to attend. If not, I 
back out. That may seem a bit extreme to you, but it works – you really know 
whether the prospect’s need is imperative and whether it’s just fishing or is 
serious about talking to you. If it’s serious, the prospect begs you to continue 
the discussion and bends over backwards to do what you ask.
	
You’re in control. You don’t have to play it the customer’s way. You do yourself 
no harm by being firm, sticking to how you want the meeting to go. Customer 
engagement should be by design, not by accident. Make sure that the design is 
yours, not the customer’s.

Getting to the sale
Most people have been jilted: not a nice feeling. It leaves you angry, sad, dimin-
ished, even powerless. In selling, like in romance, it pays to jilt rather than be 
jilted. I don’t mean that you leave your prospects feeling jilted. What I’m driv-
ing at is that you should be able to see it coming, often quite early on. If this 
marriage isn’t likely to be a happy one, respectfully disengage, giving a genuine 
reason for doing so.
Assuming that all looks good, you’ve given the prospect a proposal and are 
waiting for a decision, do you just wait, hoping for the best? Maybe not.
	
Customers are flirtatious – they’re dating others behind your back. To make 
that ultimate impression, you have to show some vulnerability so that they 
know you’re the one.
When I review carefully how the last interaction with a prospect went, I always 
know that certain things were out of whack. It’s a feeling that people want to 
sweep under the carpet with a ‘nothing I can do about it now’ resignation. 
Instead, try figuring out what didn’t work and use it to your advantage:
	
✓	Did you feel that you ‘lost’ them at specific moments?
	
✓	Did they ask questions that you couldn’t answer?
	
✓	Did they seem to want to tackle their need in a different way from your 
approach?
	
✓	Did they seem to like/trust you?
	
Take what didn’t work and set up a call with the prospect. Let the person 
know that you have a few questions about whether you’re a fit for the firm. Be 
direct in asking what the prospect is seeing – share what you identified that 
you think this individual may be unclear about.
This meeting may be your best opportunity to create alignment, value and 
trust, opening the way to serious consideration of your proposal.
It can also be a great opportunity to start seeding the customer’s 
responsibilities – what the customer will be on the hook for during delivery. 
Carefully note and work these aspects into the contract. If you do lose, it 
won’t be because you left some uncertainty at your last meeting – you gave 
it your best shot. If you win, it won’t be in the face of niggling concerns. How 
good is that?
	
This meeting may also be where you discover an issue that’s serious enough 
to derail your desire to work with this prospect. If so, sleep on it and then 
decide whether you want to withdraw your proposal. If you do, be courteous 
and appreciative of the customer’s time and trouble. Make clear that you don’t

think you’re the right fit, and why. Firms may accept your withdrawal (and if 
so you wouldn’t have won anyway) or ask you to reconsider (in which case 
you’re justified in talking to get any differences of opinion out of the way).
Building your contract process
Firms sometimes approach contracting by throwing a document over the 
fence and waiting for it to come back, usually covered in red ink (customer 
changes to your contract). That approach gives up power to the customer. 
For powerful contracting, you need two things:
	
✓	A great contract: Don’t short change yourself. The contract needs to rep-
resent what you’re willing to enforce – what the customer must provide 
and in what timeframe, the consequences of non-compliance – as well as 
a clear statement of deliverables, milestones and payment schedule.
	
✓	A process for presenting the contract: Talk to the prospect, or craft 
a good email, and convey what’s important to you. Offer to walk the 
person through the contract. Don’t give way on your wants without get-
ting something in return: for example, if you give up 15-day terms for 
payment, you can accept 30 days if the customer agrees to pay electroni-
cally. Give and take.
Read Chapter 14 for a deeper discussion on contracting and its importance 
as a pivotal moment in the process.

After your contract is signed, you need to sustain the early trust and control 
that you’ve established. This section discusses how you interact with the 
customer as you transition into DELIVER. (Chapter 4 describes moving into 
the second part of the lifecycle.)
Understanding the importance 
of relationships
	
In practice, a customer relationship is a number of connections between 
your company and the customer’s company that exist for a specific purpose 
(mutual or unilateral). These connections and how they’re used, create a cus-
tomer relationship that works (or doesn’t).

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
You need to do a bit of account planning (for your relationship with your 
customer and how you want to drive results over time) to identify the key 
relationships that you need and actively pursue getting them. Initially, these 
relationships are the ones you require to keep the work going forward, as 
shown in Table 5-1. Note that if the customer’s business is much larger than 
yours and has an army of people, the roles in the left column may be all one 
person wearing lots of different hats!

 Chapter 5: Getting Ready for Business Development
	
Developing the key customer relationships shown in the table early on allows 
you to achieve the following goals:
	
✓	Start the work on a solid foundation of relationships
	
✓	Set expectations
	
✓	Establish responsibilities
	
✓	Define how to track the project and sign-off work
	
✓	Decide how invoicing is done, what level of detail is needed, who invoices 
go to and who to call when payments are late
	
✓	Get paid on time
	
✓	Have escalation points to people who get involved with a concern or 
dispute
	
✓	Earn the right to speak to senior people any time you have something 
useful to say
	
Ensure that part of your plan is to get these relationships started and actively 
managed throughout the lifecycle. Use them when you need them, but don’t 
be neglectful. If a customer pays on time, call the person responsible and 
thank her. Take the project manager to lunch when a milestone is reached. 
Water these relationships or they die on the vine.
For now, you have enough relationships to keep the work moving forward as 
well as managing the inevitable upsets, miscommunications and issues: deal-
ing powerfully with them is what matters.
In Part V, I go into customer management in a lot more detail and expand on 
this idea of the key relationships that go beyond the specific customer proj-
ect you’re working on right now.
Completing the work
If you’ve established your key relationships and worked with your customer 
for a while, things can get very comfortable. However, you’re about to transi-
tion to a new stage: COMPLETE (refer to Figure 3-1). As your work nears con-
clusion, be clear how you’re going to get the customer to agree that you’re 
‘done’. Getting this agreement can be a thorny issue in many services situa-
tions where the deliverable is vague around the edges.
Distinguishing between DELIVER from COMPLETE is important, because you 
need to be clear with the customer that you’re ‘done’ (from your point of 
view) when you get to the end of the DELIVER stage. The COMPLETE stage 
allows you to get sign-off, not only on final deliverables, but also on the fact 
that the contracted work is completed and to secure final payment. You also 
may want to position any follow-up work or support contract.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
	
Customers often try to get extra services for nothing in the final days of the 
work, sometimes earlier (I call this scope creep). This problem is difficult to 
resist if your contract isn’t clear or your process for getting to ‘done’ is loose 
and ambiguous. You can work on these areas over time, incrementally tighten-
ing them up – because if not handled really well, they can eat into your profits 
big time.
Here are the things you need to do to prepare for ‘done’:
	
✓	Get down on paper what ‘done’ means for this customer. You typi-
cally have a list of final deliverables, when they’re completed, what the 
customer needs to do and how sign-off happens. You can also add what 
comes next – final invoice and payment, feedback interview, potential 
transition to a new piece of work or ongoing services or support.
	
✓	Share the sign-off conditions with the customer, along with the time-
line and activities for the final stages (days or weeks) of the contract. 
Do this well ahead of time so that the customer’s prepared.
	
✓	Prepare a sign-off document. Show it to the customer before the signing.
	
✓	Tackle any of the customer’s ‘we-need-you-to . . .’ items (such as ‘I 
thought we were getting this as well’). Look at your contract and decide 
whether you can push back or suggest a change order, or whether you 
just have to suck up and do the work because the customer has some 
justification for asking.
	
Get the account manager and project manager to do these steps together 
during DELIVER. Doing so helps the project manager to get the desired result, 
namely satisfactory closure on the project in the form of a sign-off by the cus-
tomer, and the account manager can handle the transition to the EVALUATE 
stage (see the next section). The project manager is probably in regular contact 
with the customer and so often knows what opportunities may be available.
You can also use these steps on longer/larger projects at specific milestones, 
which trains the client on how you operate, so that when you get to the 
COMPLETE stage (see Figure 3-1), the progress goes smoothly.
	
Completion involves finishing the work, getting sign-off and getting paid. Make 
sure that you can check all those steps every time.
Learning from Your Customers
The EVALUATE stage of the lifecycle (see Figure 3-1) is a formal opportunity 
to review how things went on a specific customer project and take a wider 
look at how well the business is performing. Tweaks to who you sell to, do

 Chapter 5: Getting Ready for Business Development
work for and how you complete with customers benefit everyone. You can 
spot small gaps in how you’re working and plug them.
Periodically, you spot signs of bigger breakdowns in your process – such as 
customers reporting that they weren’t communicated with enough during 
the project, or you had regular issues getting paid, or the customer work is 
only breaking even or losing money. You can probably think of a dozen more 
breakdowns in your own business (I discuss breakdowns in the earlier sec-
tion ‘Ensuring that you’re giving the market what it needs’). This is the time 
to gather your feedback more holistically and to reinvent what you’re doing 
and how you’re doing it. The specifics of what you need to reinvent depend 
on the issues you’re seeing.
Gathering intelligence: The 
importance of data
Before I get to reinvention, I want to discuss what data you need to be gather-
ing and from where. You obtain data from three direct sources:
	
✓	Your customers: Use the customer feedback session, as well as any 
interaction during the lifecycle, to tell you something about how things 
are going. Include ratings (quantifiable measures) and anecdotes (quali-
tative feedback) in your feedback process. In simple terms, get a score 
and get specific examples. Use Chapter 16 to design your process for 
customer feedback.
	
✓	Your team members: Take a walk through the project with them in a 
review meeting and capture their feedback. This feedback includes the 
pre-contract team too – your marketing and sales functions.
	
✓	Your business: Gather information on how your projects are performing. 
Are they getting done on time, within the budget? Is your use of staff man-
aged in a way that has projects be profitable? Are some projects more 
profitable than others?
You’re the best person to choose how to measure the performance of your 
business, but if you want to grow, you need to be on a solid foundation. As 
you become skillful in designing good measures and then using them to 
check the health of your business, the picture of where the issues are starts 
to emerge. You’re able to assess a project at the end using the quantitative 
measures you’ve designed. You only need to inspect more deeply if a prob-
lem exists with the numbers.
When you evaluate your work, you’re closing the circle on the lifecycle. Starting 
this practice while you’re still small pays huge dividends when you establish 
it as ‘normal’ and as you grow. Evaluation is the difference between managing 
order or chaos.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
Beyond data from your lifecycle performance, you can also use other sources 
if you decide that you need to do some reinvention. See Table 3-3 for a few 
places you can go to get external data.
	
Where do you put all this intelligence coming in? I have three guidelines:
	
✓	Keep data simple.
	
✓	Keep data accessible – use an appropriate system to store customer 
data and market intelligence (advice on choosing the right tools is in 
Chapter 13).
	
✓	Make sure that your team contributes and uses the data.
	
Of course, some data has to be kept confidential. You may not want to share 
data about individual performances or salaries or even customer invoices. The 
more transparent you are about performance, the more willingly your team is 
to work to get to the right results, as shown by your key metrics. Where you 
start to suspect that an individual is underperforming, you’re in difficult terri-
tory and so go to your HR support to handle it. This kind of situation is not for 
sharing.
Evaluating your offer
When you combine market intelligence with feedback from your team and 
your customers, you have solid data for a regular evaluation of your offer. 
Here are the key questions to ask yourself:
	
✓	Is your offer still a fit for what customers need?
	
✓	Are you providing high levels of customer satisfaction?
	
✓	Are you incorporating best practices, including being up-to-date and 
using a solid methodology for your work with clients.
	
✓	Are you competitive – as good as or better than your competition? Are 
you highly valuable to your customers?
	
✓	Are you less flexible than you need to be?
	
✓	Is your offer under threat of replacement by a new solution/product?
The ultimate question is ‘Do we need to make a shift in our offer?’. If you do, 
this chapter is a good foundation for the process you need to go through, as 
are Chapters 6 and 7. If something dramatic happens in your space, such as 
the emergence of a completely new and less costly way of doing what you

 Chapter 5: Getting Ready for Business Development
do, you’d be foolish not to attend to it right away. But, at least, check the cur-
rency of your offer at least once a year: in other words, check that your offer 
is still what the market currently needs.
	
Unlike your work with a customer, business development is never finished, 
because your business is an ever-evolving entity. Your business development 
practices, including using the lifecycle to think about, design, manage and 
deliver on your business goals, are ways of bringing systematic management 
to your business.

Building Your Business 
Development Plan
In This Chapter
▶	Considering the essential role of planning
▶	Formulating your successful plan
I
 
f you’ve ever run a marathon, got married or settled down in front of the 
TV to binge on Breaking Bad DVD box sets, you know that these activities 
don’t turn out well if you leave things to chance. You need to prepare, plan 
and execute properly to succeed. Every so often, you look at the plan and ask 
yourself how you’re doing: ‘Was my 15-mile run on pace?’; ‘Did the cake get 
ordered last week?’; ‘Do I have enough beers in the mini-fridge?’
Without a plan and a way to monitor how you’re doing, you’re likely to lose 
the game. And running a business is like a game, with a purpose, rules, scor-
ing, challenges and other competitors: lose some, win some, but become the 
best team you can.
In Chapter 5, I lead you through developing your offer. When your offer’s 
ready, you can start to build your business development plan. Here I help you 
focus on the areas most important to your success, so that you can build a 
plan specific to your business, starting from where you are today and where 
you want to be one year from now. It’s a short-term plan, because that makes 
it about real action, not ‘head in the clouds’ long-term visions. Nothing wrong 
with those, but you want to be doing things today.
By the end of this chapter, you have a high-level plan in your hands that 
allows you to measure how you’re doing, track progress against goals and 
know what’s working and what isn’t. Your plan is going to be about managing 
business development.
On the ground, you use specific strategies to get results and choose the best 
approaches for you. To flesh out your tactics in detail, jump to Chapter 10 
(on marketing), Chapter 13 (sales), Chapter 16 (customer management) or 
Chapter 20 (partnerships), where I cover the specifics for these different areas.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
Planning for Business 
Development Success
Before you start the planning, I want to reiterate the role that business devel-
opment has in helping you to attain your goals (your ‘big’ objectives):
Business development is the process required to achieve growth through 
the acquisition of profitable net new customers and expansion of existing 
customers.
	
Business development is essentially forward-looking. You require discipline to 
prioritize tasks that bring longer-term benefits, rather than immediate gratifi-
cation, and to work on activities that can wait until tomorrow ‒ while dealing 
with today’s priorities, including the crisis of the moment. After all if you can 
push business development activities to tomorrow, why not next week or next 
month?
No, for your business to succeed you have to plan properly, develop clear 
goals and work daily to achieve them.
Winging business development 
doesn’t work
You have to find a way to make business development a priority and also 
make space for the work that needs to be done every day, systematically, 
by you or by your team members. Business development work needs to be 
imperative; you have to start measuring so that you can sustain the forward 
action.
You have to shift ‘What next?’ to ‘What’s going to get me to my goal?’ (which I 
cover in the next section).
	
Your business development plan needs to include:
	
✓	Goals: Broken down into milestones (intermediate goals): ‘Where do I 
want to be in 12 months?’ and ‘Where do I need to be this month?’
	
✓	Metrics: Numbers that measure the health of your business (see the 
later section ‘Working on metrics’ for more).
	
✓	Targets: Specific numbers that individuals are aiming to reach. Targets 
ensure that the metric is in a healthy state.
	
✓	Measures: How you count progress towards a target.
	
✓	Tactics: Major groups of activities that contribute to the above points.

99
 Chapter 6: Building Your Business Development Plan
If you have all these items, great: you’re building by design, not by accident. 
Your plan helps you know what to do next, prioritize what’s important, avoid 
busy work (activities that make no difference to your goals) and see which 
tactics are working and which aren’t.
In addition, your plan (as I develop it in this chapter) includes:
	
✓	Communication strategies: How do I enroll others in my plan? (Flip to 
Chapter 7 for details.)
	
✓	Risk management: What risks may I need to plan for? (Again, check out 
Chapter 7.)
Although businesses can grow without a plan, they require a hefty dose of 
luck: like showing up at the train station knowing that you have to get to 
Sometown, but you don’t know the timetable, the connections or the cost. 
Maybe you get there, most likely you don’t. Perhaps planning the journey 
would’ve been a good idea.
Knowing where you’re going
Worse still, imagine turning up at the train station without even knowing your 
destination. You know that you need to be somewhere, just not precisely 
where. That’s why you need near-term goals as part of your plan. I’m talking 
here about the type of goals you can measure and use to drive results quickly.
Different types of goals exist, of course. For example:
	
✓	Total revenue
	
✓	EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ‒ 
it’s a mouthful so just think ‘profit’)
	
✓	Number of employees
	
✓	Number of customers
	
I mention EBITDA because if you ever happen to want to sell your firm, it’s a 
measure in which the accountants take an interest when they value your 
business.
Make your goals measurable ‒ ideally they’re quantitative (numbers such 
as revenue, number of staff, number of customers, size of pipeline), so that 
when you check your performance, you can say ‘we did it’ (hurrah!) or ‘we 
didn’t make it’ (ouch!). Avoid goals such as ‘improve the methodology’ 
(which is qualitative) and instead try the measurable ‘all staff members have 
been trained on the new methodology by [date]’.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
	
You can all too easily confuse goals (where you want to be further down the 
road) with metrics (numbers that tell you whether your business is healthy). 
One trick is to check whether you can break down the goal you’re thinking of 
into milestones – such as, ‘If I get to here by the end of June, I’m on track.’
Creating Your Winning Plan
In this section on creating your business development plan, I use a total rev-
enue goal as illustration, but you can substitute your own goals, of course.
	
Your goals don’t have to be numbers. They can be other types of objectives, 
such as, ‘create a productive partnership with XYZ Co’. However, when you 
move from goal to metric, you tease out the measurable aspects of your goal, 
such as, ‘eight joint presentations this year with XYZ Co’ and then create tar-
gets for each month or quarter.
Back to revenue. Your plan is going to be for one year and broken down into 
monthly revenue milestones. If you hit each milestone, you reach the goal. 
With goals, milestones, metrics (the numbers) and sources of new opportuni-
ties to hand, you can then use Chapter 7 to manage your tactics and help you 
reach the overall goal.
	
Be realistic with your goals: make them attainable but with a bit of stretch 
added in, just a little more than you think you can do. Revenue is a good goal 
to work on (no surprise there). After all, if the money side works, so does the 
business. I also strongly suggest you track profit, gross or net.
I design the planning exercise in this chapter to help you track revenue from 
net new customers and expansion of existing ones and to look for areas to 
improve performance in both. This planning exercise is a tool for your man-
agement team to see how you’re doing.
	
Your planning is certain to be influenced by factors I don’t know about. If you 
have large, stable long-term customers, your plan is sure to look different 
from someone with smaller, short-term customers: simply adapt your plan as 
necessary.
If numbers aren’t your thing, and they’re not everyone’s cup of Java, you 
need to get comfortable with only a few simple measures. Then you can del-
egate the tough stuff to someone else. Just don’t do an ostrich on me!

 Chapter 6: Building Your Business Development Plan
Choosing where to start planning
You can’t build a plan for the next 12 months unless you know where you are 
today. Whether or not you have your reporting act together, you’re going to 
need data that allows you to check how you’re doing against the plan.
At the simplest level, you need to do the following:
	
✓	Look at your last 12 months’ results.
	
✓	Set a goal for the next 12 months.
	
✓	Project numbers out month-by-month for 12 months.
Take your revenue for the last 12 months and up it by an appropriate percent-
age. You want a minimum of 15‒20 per cent growth year on year. Go back over 
the past few years, if you’ve been going that long, and see what your growth 
rate has been – and that includes downs as well as ups. If you think that you 
can do 25 per cent growth next year, conservatively, push it to 30 per cent. 
Frighten yourself a little – good for the circulation.
	
In the early years, you can see growth percentages of 100 per cent, 500 per 
cent or more. As you get larger, this percentage declines, which is fine if your 
revenue is still growing at a respectable rate. You can’t keep up astronomical 
growth in services, because your revenue is highly dependent on people and 
a limit applies to how fast you can assimilate customers and hire new staff 
without impacting quality (unless you start into acquisitions, for example, and 
that’s a whole other ball game).
I assume that your year-end is 31 December. Most likely it’s not December as 
you’re reading this chapter right now, so use this guide:
	
✓	September–December: Plan for the rest of this year and all next year.
	
✓	June–August: Plan through to the end of next June. Revisit in January of 
next year and plan the rest of the year.
	
✓	January–May: Plan the rest of this year, and in December plan for next 
year.
You can find a planning spreadsheet at www.dummies.com/go/
businessdevelopment.
Assume that it’s April right now. Figure 6-1 shows a part of your plan where 
the revenue from last year was $500,000 (£315,000) and the goal for this year 
is set at $950,000 (£598,500). Big growth coming!

 Chapter 6: Building Your Business Development Plan
Fill your plan with projected numbers and add actuals when you have them. 
In the case in the table, January–March are actuals and April is looking 
good, but not finalized until invoices go out. The rest of the cells are gray 
(projections).
	
Have no less than six months of projected revenues. Think of those monthly 
projections as your milestones on the way to your goal.
Now break down where that revenue is going to come from: your existing cus-
tomers and your pipeline (your list of prospective customers and where they 
are in the process of buying services). I tackle these two revenue sources one 
at a time.
Existing customers
Customers are in the DELIVER or COMPLETE stages of the lifecycle (check 
out Figure 3-1); otherwise they’re past customers.
List your existing contracts. Then think about each customer and whether 
more work is likely to come from them. As far as possible, predict revenue 
across the months from existing customers when you’re secure that you:
	
✓	Have a contract
	
✓	Have specific new opportunities (prospective contracts, statements of 
work or change orders)
	
✓	Can reliably base your expectations on prior performance
	
Enter individual contracts and opportunities on separate rows. Also, don’t 
forget to add any historical customers that you may not be doing work with 
today but have new opportunities with.
Figure 6-2 shows the forecast of where (which months) the revenue will hit 
for booked business and new potential. Note that the figure doesn’t yet show 
prospects (net new customers). That’s coming next.
	
For the purpose of goal-setting, tracking customer opportunities with your 
booked business keeps responsibility for the goal with the customer manage-
ment team. In terms of your pipeline management day to day, you can defi-
nitely include these opportunities with your prospective new customers, for 
sales tracking purposes (see Chapter 13 for more on this topic).
Prospective customers
The next thing you bring to this plan is your pipeline – the list of prospects 
that are considering your services: in other words, they’re in the PRESENT/
PROPOSE or even CONTRACT stages of the lifecycle (see Figure 3-1).

 Chapter 6: Building Your Business Development Plan
If you already have a system for managing your pipeline, for example, a 
spreadsheet, or a sales management system such as Salesforce, you can use 
the data from those sources. If your pipeline is in your head, or someone 
else’s, you need to stop relying entirely on your brain.
	
Pipelines usually show the overall project budget, but they don’t necessarily 
spread that budget out into the months when you expect the work to be done. 
So as well as the total fees for each prospect, you need to estimate two other 
things:
	
✓	When the work will happen: Project revenue out into those month(s).
	
✓	A percentage probability against each opportunity: The likelihood that 
the deal will close (percentage goes up the closer you get to a sale).
Figure 6-3 shows the prospect part of your planning spreadsheet in two parts: 
at the top are the projected numbers; at the bottom, the monthly projections 
have been weighted (reduced by multiplying the revenue numbers, both total 
and monthly, by the percentage probability of closure). The reason for weight-
ing is that as you win and lose deals, your actual revenue roughly matches 
your original weighted prediction. Over time, your skill at projecting future 
revenue becomes more and more accurate.
If you’re wondering why the total value of opportunities and projected rev-
enue for the year are different in the top half of the table, the reason is that 
one of the contracts goes beyond the end of this year.
So, with goals, milestones, customer projections and prospect projections, 
you get to see the whole picture. Figure 6-4 shows your totals only.
	
Think of it as your dashboard and watch it closely.
Mind the gap!
As you track your total projected revenue from customers and prospects, 
you almost certainly have a gap if you’re looking forward 12 months:
Goal – Customer Business – Weighted Prospects = Gap
Figure 6-4 shows a gap of $200,500 (£126,315) in the prospect list, which 
requires completely new sales opportunities to fill it.
	
You shouldn’t have a gap for the current month. If you have a gap for next 
month or the one after (as in row 6 of Figure 6-4), you have a problem (pop to 
Chapter 13 for how to ‘panic now’!).

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
The gap is important because it represents the completely new business that 
your marketing and sales efforts have to produce. The gap should be pretty 
small for the next three months – unless a miracle happens, you can’t fill 
such a near-term gap, unless your sales cycle is very short indeed.
Your task, if you choose to accept it, is systematically to fill your pipeline 
over time to reduce the gap as the months roll by and to convert opportuni-
ties into customer revenue.
	
Here are a few things to note:
	
✓	Don’t flatline your revenue. Just like you’re looking for year-to-year 
growth, you should also be looking for month-to-month growth.
	
✓	Look carefully at the revenue patterns of the past couple of years. For 
example, if your business is seasonal, namely with predictable trends as 
to when in the year you’re particularly busy and when you have some 
slack, build those peaks and troughs into your planned numbers.
	
✓	Try to estimate the length of your sales cycle. If you start projecting for 
miraculous sales, you may fall behind, so allow time for sales to catch 
up with your vision.
	
✓	Be ambitious with your goals and conservative with your projections. 
The gap drives a sense of urgency. Don’t underestimate the importance 
of minding the gap.
At this point, you may be elated at the possibility of projected growth, in 
despair about how you’re going to achieve it or somewhere in the middle. 
Just remember that in future you’re going to know how you’re doing and 
knowing is the first step to impacting the outcome. Courage, mon brave.
	
For this illustration I use revenue as a goal, which you can also convert to a 
metric. An actual revenue number is a goal; the percentage of actual to plan 
(projected revenue) is a metric (see the next section).
Working on metrics
Metrics are real numbers that tell you about the health of your business. You 
best set them as ideals – in that you expect to trend towards them but not 
meet them right away (distinct from goals, which you expect to reach).
	
A metric is a measure of business health. It’s usually a percentage or a ratio 
(such as your win rate or the percentage of customers giving you five marks 
out of five). If you can break a number down into discrete milestones, it’s prob-
ably a goal rather than a metric. For example, increasing your staff by 10 this

 Chapter 6: Building Your Business Development Plan
year is a goal; increasing by 25 per cent is a metric that can stand for a longer 
time as a measure of growth. Goals change from year to year, metrics have 
longevity.
Table 6-1 shows some typical metrics and how to track them.
Table 6-1	
How to Track Metrics
Metric
How to Track
Which Way Should It Go
Revenue: Percentage 
of goal reached
Set a monthly projection 
for 12 months ahead and 
track the actuals as they 
come in.
You want to attain 100 
per cent. In other words, 
your revenue projections 
should be as close to 
spot on as possible.
Gross Margin: 
Revenue minus cost 
of delivering the 
business
Have a target percent-
age, probably in the 
range 25‒50 per cent. 
Note: don’t include oper-
ational/fixed expenses.
Upwards! Most services 
businesses can’t surpass 
50 per cent, though a few 
do. The goal is to push it 
higher by charging more 
and/or increasing the 
efficiency of delivery.
Average deal size in 
the pipeline
Check what it currently is 
and set an average deal 
size that’s 20 per cent.
Upwards! Larger deals 
allow you to reduce the 
number of customers, 
focusing on each with 
more depth and dili-
gence. It doesn’t always 
mean a lot more work – 
just the ability to deliver 
higher value.
Win percentage: 
Wins divided by total 
number of opportu-
nities that reach a 
decision
Check what it currently is 
and increase by 1 in 10. It 
makes a huge difference.
Upwards! Be realistic, 
though. Losing is not 
always failure – it can 
be a sign that you’re 
stretching yourself. Note: 
if you track your win 
percentage, you’re also 
tracking your loss per-
centage and seeking to 
reduce it.

How to Track
Which Way Should It Go
Customer satisfac-
tion measured by 
customer reviews
You’re aiming for five out 
of five (see Chapter 16 for 
a review format).
Upwards! Happy cus-
tomers are a significant 
contribution to you, your 
business and your future 
success.
DSO (days sales out-
standing): Measure 
of how fast you get 
paid DSO = accounts 
receivable divided 
by (annual sales/365 
days)
Create a target that no 
customer is later than 
seven days beyond the 
invoice due date. Train 
customers by reminding 
them that their invoice 
is due and call them as 
soon as they’re late.
Downwards or holding 
steady! Calculate your 
DSO on the same day 
each month (perhaps the 
last day and before you 
send out invoices).
Check your DSO each 
month to see whether it’s 
coming down.
Lead conversion 
per cent: Number 
of leads converted 
divided by total 
number of new leads
Set a percentage – if 
currently 1 or 2 per cent, 
set the goal at 3 per cent. 
Track how many leads 
convert to an opportunity.
Predictability is impor-
tant. The cost of convert-
ing needs to produce a 
result that justifies the 
investment.
The table simply contains example metrics – you can use many more. Pick 
the ones that work for you and make them public. Have everyone committed 
to driving results in the right direction.
Components of your plan: 
Creating the blueprint
Where, I hear you ask, are my prospects going to come from to fill the spread-
sheet in the preceding section? You’re going to use your business develop-
ment plans to drive your engine, the high-level one in this chapter and the 
detailed plans for marketing (Chapter 10), sales (Chapter 12), customer man-
agement (Chapter 16) and partnerships (Chapter 20).
You’re doing business today, of course, but perhaps you’re not measuring 
what you should to be really sure of where you are. Taking the one step of 
creating metrics and measuring with diligence is the single most effective 
tool for growing your business: it changes everyone’s behavior. But I know 
Table 6‑1 (continued)

111
 Chapter 6: Building Your Business Development Plan
that you want to get started right away, so here I outline how to produce a 
simple 3–6 month plan. You can create a longer-term strategy when your 
short-term plan is underway.
First question: Where do your customers come from?
Review your customer list from the past couple of years and see where your 
customers come from:
	
✓	Your own network?
	
✓	A referral from a customer, employee or partner?
	
✓	An event?
	
✓	Online (search engine optimization (SEO), ads, blog posts, social media, 
your website)?
	
✓	Mailing or emailing?
	
✓	A cold call?
If you can, do the same for your losses. If you don’t have the data on pros-
pects, don’t sweat it. Just start gathering that information in the future. For 
now, the most important thing is to know where your successes came from 
and, in the short term, focus effort on the most productive sources.
	
The sources that have been effective for you in the past may not sustain your 
growth longer term. Focus on your top sources in the short term, say this 
year, while you start to experiment with other channels.
Doing the right things to get customers
Are you using the right tactics for getting new 
customers? You can encounter surprises when 
you look closely at where your business is 
coming from (your wins) and where not (your 
losses). For example, I see companies spending 
lots of money on SEO to drive people to their 
websites so that they can sign up to be con-
tacted (I’m oversimplifying here to make the 
point).
In many cases, none of those so-called leads 
convert into business; as well as the cost of 
SEO, someone spent time calling, qualifying and 
trying to progress the relationship for no benefit. 
I’m not suggesting you don’t use SEO – it can be 
a powerful tool – just make sure that the chan-
nels you use are producing wins, not just noise 
in your pipeline (sounds painful, and is!).
To counter that thought, some activities, such 
as brand-building and recognition, become 
more important as you start to grow, say from 
$10 to $20 million and beyond. You need a stron-
ger identity in the marketplace than you require 
when you’re small. Not all your tactics have to 
be designed to produce wins – other goals are 
perfectly valid.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
Second question: What percentage of your business 
comes from the sources you’ve identified?
You need to work this percentage out based on the customers that come 
from each source. Count the revenue from each source (not the number of 
customers). Plan out what your future investment in those sources is going 
to be.
For example, if 75 per cent of your business comes from your network (busi-
ness contacts referring prospects to you), in the short term court those 
contacts and add new ones (I call them ‘friends and family’) in a systematic 
manner. Thank them for helping you. Take them out to lunch. Send them a 
gift card when they give you a referral. Educate them as to the sort of leads 
you’re looking for.
I provide a couple more examples in Table 6-2. Follow this model for all your 
sources and confirm or replan your investment of time and/or money.
Table 6-2	
Sources of Your Wins (Tactics You Use)

Percentage of Revenue From 
This Source
Future Investment/Tactic

referral
5 per cent
Institute a prospect refer-
ral bonus for employees, 
which pays out if the cus-
tomer signs a contract. 
See whether you can boost 
this source with little effort 
beyond having your employ-
ees understand what you’re 
looking for.
Partner 
referral
60 per cent
Spend a lot of time with 
partners, court them, make 
sure that they know your 
successes so they can share 
them, ask them what would 
have them send you more 
referrals: work as closely 
with them as possible on 
new opportunities, sched-
ule regular pipeline review 
meetings, look for ways to 
reciprocate. Set a budget to 
nurture this stream.

 Chapter 6: Building Your Business Development Plan
	
Upselling to an existing customer is always easier than selling to a new one, as 
is selling to a referral rather than to a cold lead. Spend time figuring out where 
to spend your time and when you decide, stick with it. Avoid knee-jerk reac-
tions if you don’t see a deal in a couple of weeks.
By all means get creative and play with ideas. Don’t entirely neglect sources 
that provide lots of leads, just not the right size. Explain what you’re look-
ing for and why. If you decide to try a new source and new tactic, treat it as 
a pilot and monitor it closely to see whether it produces a result, such as an 
increase in the number of prospects/wins.
At the end of this exercise, you have a plan to do the following:
	
✓	Eliminate or minimize non-producing sources.
	
✓	Optimize low-producing sources.
	
✓	Maximize and enhance high-producing sources.
	
✓	Introduce new sources and track how they perform.
Use your revenue plan to determine the effort that needs to go into upselling 
existing customers (or asking for referrals or expanding into another depart-
ment or division of their business) as against the effort that needs to go into 
net new sales.
	
If you include a wild new idea, that’s great, just don’t put all your eggs in that 
basket. If a quick fix existed, everyone would be doing it. Don’t let a company sell 
you a service it says gets you an instant pipeline. Be sceptical – ask a lot of ques-
tions of your friends and family before you jump into something completely new.
Monitoring progress
The numbers are your clue as to whether your team’s performance is going 
to deliver the goods. The best way to get at those numbers is to have sys-
tems that can provide you with reports, with no more than 30 minutes effort 
per week. Your finance system and your SFA/CRM (sales force automation/ 
customer relationship management system) should be able to provide most 
of what you need. Simple spreadsheets can do the rest.
Tracking the performance of a specific tactic provides the following:
	
✓	You get clear evidence of whether you’re on track.
	
✓	You can inspect – namely you can examine each tactic and ask for specif-
ics that underlie the numbers (see Chapter 7).
	
✓	You can see whether the tactic is working (see Chapter 10 for more on 
measuring marketing tactics and Chapter 13 for measuring sales tactics).

If you don’t track, you have less accountability, staff members are less driven 
to be active in their efforts and results decline or even disappear into thin air. 
No matter how diligent you are, few people are wired to be on their game all 
day every day.
Consider adding an incentive (often called a spiff) for a target reached. The 
combination of metric and incentive is your stick and carrot. Use both if 
you can. Also, consider paying for performance, not for time. Although 
people can and do lie about their activities, if you’re tracking properly and 
inspecting rigorously, they get found out.
Based on your chosen tactics, select what to track. Use Chapter 7 to guide 
you in designing simple tools and processes – and then enforce them. Think 
about tracking the following:
	
✓	Revenue
	
✓	Cold calls – number of calls, conversations and conversions from lead to 
prospect
	
✓	Pipeline – number of opportunities, average size of deals and wins
Consider having a visible dashboard, a physical board or a virtual one 
(online), to give the whole company a transparent view of how things are 
going.

uilding something is satisfying (such as the business development plan 
you construct in Chapter 6), but you don’t then want to leave it on the 
shelf gathering dust; where’s the fun in that? No, like a child who’s built a 
model airplane, you can’t wait to race down to the local park and see it in 
action. But you need to prepare for that flight – so that the plane doesn’t 
crash the first time out and spend the rest of its life dangling sadly from a 
high treetop. This chapter guides you through a successful launch of your 
plan.
Growing your business involves change: more customers, more staff, more 
revenue, higher levels of investment, more risk and tighter cash flow. 
Therefore, you need to change the plan from Chapter 6 as you experience 
each new challenge. Here I help you roll out your first (fairly simple) plan, 
guiding you through the key steps: carrying out initial activities concerned 
with communication and setup, and then some regular, reliable and measur-
able tasks for taking care of business development over time.
Where a team’s involved, the start and roll-out are critical. You need to enrol 
team members in your vision so that everyone pulls in the same direction 
when the work gets going. Don’t short-change these activities in your eager-
ness to get started. Effort upfront in communicating your plan maximizes 
your results down the road.
	
Get the wider company’s employees onboard as well: your business growth is 
their guarantee of continued employment.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
Checking Your Plan before Lift-off
A business development plan is just a piece of paper with no life: it can certainly 
energize people, but alone it doesn’t generate action. For that you need to state 
specific milestones and tactics, identify initial tasks to begin carrying out the 
plan, decide who’s going to help and with what, and calculate your investment 
of time and money.
	
Your initial business development plan has to be fairly short term: plan for 
12 months to keep you focused on near-term results and detail tactics for the 
first 3–6 months to keep your actions focused.
	
Ensure that your plan, at a minimum, comprises the following and that you’re 
in good shape:
	
✓	Goals: Key measures of where you want to be in 12 months, such as rev-
enue or number of customers.
	
✓	Milestones: Monthly targets to tell you whether you’re on track for a 
goal.
	
✓	Metrics: Target numbers you track to ensure that activities are being 
done.
	
✓	Tactics: Specific activities to drive your customer and revenue 
acquisition.
If you don’t yet have all these elements in place, read Chapter 6 to make sure 
that your plan is solid.
	
Don’t go it alone. Even if your company is very small, or you’re the only one 
doing any business development activities in it, remember that services is a 
team game: so go get yourself a team. If you’re only accountable to yourself 
(or to the boss), you don’t have the support structure you need to keep going 
when the going gets tough – as it surely will.
Setting milestones, tactics and metrics
Your plan is founded – and indeed is dependent on – key goals. If you don’t 
have a place to get to, how can you know what the journey should look like? 
Imagine that I want to drive from Los Angeles to New York for a concert in ten 
days’ time: that’s my goal. My plan may include gas costs, hotel charges and 
meals, and a fellow driver or two, plus a few contingencies in case the car 
breaks down.

117
 Chapter 7: Putting Your Plan into Action
But without milestones (for example, actual hard mileage I need to drive 
every day) how can I know that my plan is feasible and, when I’m on the 
road, how can I tell whether I’m on track? With milestones in place, I can start 
detailing how to reach them, how much budget to allocate, who to have as 
co-drivers and how to get help if disaster strikes.
In Chapter 6, I focus mostly on the goal of revenue and where this revenue is 
going to come from, whereas here I discuss how to track the key goals that 
you choose for your plan, as you set up milestones and metrics. I provide 
examples and you can adapt the concepts to your plan. Meanwhile, think 
about who’s accountable for those milestones and metrics.
Creating milestones
	
Based on the goals you have in your plan, you need to set specific milestones 
to keep you on track. Typically, you measure milestones numerically. I give a 
few examples in addition to the ones in Chapter 6:
	
✓	Profit per month: You want to get a grip on your gross profit and your 
net profit on a monthly basis. Gross profit is the revenue minus the cost 
of sales (namely how much it costs you in staff and expenses to acquire 
and deliver the business). Net profit is the revenue minus all expenses 
(including overhead and fixed costs such as rent or computers).
	
✓	Number of employees: Similar to revenue, when will your plan call for 
additional staff? Spread the hiring across the year and set some metrics 
for how many staff you need to interview to fill your open positions.
	
✓	Average revenue per customer: Typically, you base this figure on com-
pleted projects and set a goal to increase the number. This approach 
works well if customer projects are short. Alternatively, you can use 
your 12-month projection, including actual customer revenue as the 
months progress, to compare to last year’s actual result.
You can set and use all sorts of goals and milestones. Some of them apply 
to the first half of the lifecycle and some to the second (see Figure 3-1). 
Therefore, different people are involved in managing and measuring, that 
is, contributing to the goal. Of course, they’re already contributing; you just 
want them to be responsible for the outcome. To do that, you have to make 
the goals and milestones overt.
	
Don’t go overboard: start with two or three goals/milestones at most and 
include a small number of people to be in charge of them. You can always add 
more later.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
Relating milestones and metrics
Now you need to take the next step and set targets (metrics) for the tactics 
that are going to drive your goals. I focus on management tactics that apply 
in every business. Throughout this book, I discuss grass-roots tactics for 
choosing tactics that will deliver on your goals, but for now I’m assuming 
that you stick mostly with what you’re doing today and start tweaking it to 
improve performance – by watching your numbers, delegating responsibility 
and introducing new approaches gradually.
I use the goal of revenue to drill down to some tactics, associated metrics 
and how to track progress. Table 7-1 shows some measures to help you maxi-
mize revenue.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
Some of these milestones and tactics relate to pre-contract goals, and some 
to the delivery phase of the lifecycle, spreading the responsibility across the 
organization.
	
Although Table 7-1 refers to a lot of reporting, the act of reviewing the num-
bers, noting high and low performance and whether you’re on track, actually 
changes behavior. People start to ask, ‘What caused that?’, ‘What should 
we do differently?’, ‘How can we repeat that success?’ That’s the underlying 
change you’re trying to effect.
I’m going to include one example of a grass-roots tactic, so that you can 
refine your own ideas. Say you use cold calling to generate prospects. 
Table 7-2 shows what the table entry would look like.
Monitoring tactics at grass-roots level
Part of driving up revenue (maybe an important 
part) comes from acquiring new customers. You 
can employ all sorts of tactics for driving pros-
pects into your pipeline. Assume that you need 
eight prospects in the pipeline to close one new 
customer a month and that one of your tactics 
is cold calling (something companies often 
invest a lot of time and effort in for little result). 
How can you monitor its effectiveness? (By the 
way, I’m not advocating cold calling – it works 
in some businesses and not in others. If you do 
decide to try it, give it three months at least.)
Without historical data, establishing a target 
is hard, but you have to start somewhere. How 
many cold calls a day do you think are needed? 
How many conversations will occur from this 
number? How many will convert to a prospect 
(where the lead is interested and accepts a 
second call to dig deeper)? If you’re not track-
ing the numbers, you can’t predict how many 
calls get to a solid opportunity and eventually 
a win.
Ideally, you’d have a system that captures dials, 
where conversations are logged and conver-
sions are captured, but who has that? Not 
many small companies, that’s for sure. As an 
alternative, you need a simple logging tool (say 
a spreadsheet, with the numbers to be logged 
daily against a weekly target). Say you target 
40 calls per day, 2 conversations per day and 
2 conversions to a prospect per week. Make 
sure that your callers have a suitable calling 
list where they can make notes, check off every 
call made and record the results. At the end of 
the day, they count up and enter the numbers 
into the tracking spreadsheet. You, or one of 
your managers, needs to review the summary 
and inspect some of the detail every week.
If you’re not getting the right average of conver-
sations and conversions, something has to shift. 
Does the number of calls need to go up? Do you 
need to improve your calling strategy, your 
follow-through, your nurturing of these leads?

Track cold calls weekly,

An average of two leads

your caller is capturing 
calls, conversations and 
conversions.
To track performance, you need to establish a weekly report against a spe-
cific target number of calls/conversions. See the sidebar ‘Monitoring tactics 
at grass-roots level’ for a deeper dive into this example.
You can add to your on-the-ground tactics as well – Parts III to VI help you do 
that, as well as put them into action.
Monitoring performance
Beyond the initial tactics and how to keep an eye on them, you need to build 
some grass-roots monitoring to get a handle on what works. Reporting is all 
very well (and useful): just make sure that you also inspect regularly, namely 
drill down into the numbers to the specific activities by a team member with 
a prospect or a customer. If you’re concerned about people inflating their 
numbers, don’t worry too much. If they promise and don’t deliver, a deeper 
review becomes necessary. Your inspections are invaluable here.
Choose your milestone and metrics and work out how your tactic will meet 
them, how often you’ll report and how to make sure that you reach the over-
all goal.
	
Pick a milestone or metric you think you may struggle with and map it out as 
shown in Table 7-1.
Identifying initial tasks
As your business development plan deepens, you need to consider what first 
tasks to think about and work on. How much preparation you have to do 
depends on the extent to which you’re shifting what you’re doing already:
	
✓	You’re using the same basic approach as you did before, but adding 
some monitoring (goals, milestones, metrics gathering, inspection, 
adjustment). Your initial tasks focus on designing your monitoring so 
that’s it’s easy to use and thinking about how to roll it out to the team.

122
Part II: Planning for Business Development 
	
✓	Your approach is the same, but you need to add more people to the 
team. As long as your monitoring is planned, your task is to design a pro-
cess to get existing employees and/or new ones onboard. Outline what 
you think team members need to know about your business development 
approach, what to do and how to record what’s being done. Consider 
setting up a mentoring program. Take your best business development 
team member(s) – maybe that’s you – and set up a support structure for 
new team members. Give them an hour of your time every week for the 
first couple of months, and let them shadow you at events, on sales calls, 
in customer meetings. See Chapter 13 for a strategy for adding new sales 
people – the principles apply whatever the role of the newcomer.
	
✓	You’re streamlining your existing approach and trying one or two new 
ideas. Of course, you need monitoring and everyone has to be trained, 
but when you start changing things, you may meet resistance. Give the 
team confidence by designing how the new idea will be implemented as 
fully as you can. Ask for and be willing to incorporate feedback. Dip into 
some other chapters for guidance on specific tactics – whether they be 
marketing (Part III), sales (Part IV), customer management (Part V) or 
partnership ideas (Part VI).
	
If you’re trying to shift your practices significantly, prepare a high-level over-
view to share with your staff and your friends and family. Identify when you’re 
going to roll out the different tactics; make sure that your plan is realistic and 
only go into the detail when doing so is timely. Change is a slow process and 
doing one or two things well is preferable to doing six things badly.
Calling on helpers
Business development is a complex and wide-ranging process, as you see 
from Figure 3-1: no one person can be good at everything that needs to be 
done. The success of your business shouldn’t rest on your shoulders alone. 
You need a support structure as a leader, people you can talk to and people 
you can delegate to:
	
✓	You can’t know everything. Awesome as you are as a leader, others may 
have more experience, better insights, more objective thinking than you 
do in any given area.
	
✓	Different tactics require different proficiencies and experiences. 
Working with leads or prospects or customers, doing the finances, man-
aging the office and leading the company, all rely on specific skills and 
talents. If you’re in any doubt about that, consider your own background 
and preferences. What tasks are you good at? What tasks are you medio-
cre at? Take a look at the sidebar ‘Personality and your business success’.

 Chapter 7: Putting Your Plan into Action
	
✓	Your people really do want your business to succeed. Modern business 
suffers so much from responsibility for the results all sitting at the top, 
from not allowing everyone to take their share of the goal and do their 
bit towards it. Go it alone and you end up doing everything and working 
100 hours a week. Share it and you’ll be leading and managing, and doing 
a lot less ‘doing’.
	
Being in your own skin is like being a fish – you don’t notice the water you 
swim in. Jump out of the lake and take a look around. Consider whether your 
own strengths and capabilities are coloring your perspective. Are you holding 
on too tight or are you willing to get help, share the load and grow the careers 
of others?
By all means stick to what you’re good at, but be willing to have others lead 
the charge in the key areas that secure growth and in which they’re better 
than you are.
Personality and your business success
Owners, business leaders and others in ser-
vices firms contribute to their companies in 
different ways, especially in business devel-
opment. Two factors are the source of the 
differences:
	✓	The personality and proclivities of the 
people
	✓	The nature of the business and the subject-
matter expertise
These factors are connected. Consider these 
two examples:
	✓	Subject-matter experts, such as a manage-
ment consultant, are well educated, prob-
ably great at winkling out inadequacies, 
getting to the bottom of them and propos-
ing well thought-out solutions. They tend to 
be objective, not emotional, creative within 
their own sphere, but not artistic, inter-
ested rather more in facts than in opinions. 
They’re confident in their own abilities, sys-
tematic and, typically, successful: maybe 
mildly contemptuous of the mess other 
mortals get themselves into. Not always 
natural team players, when they delegate 
things that don’t get done in what they see 
as ‘my way’, or the ‘right way’, it can drive 
them crazy.
	✓	Serial entrepreneurs are natural creators 
or enablers of new business ideas and nat-
urally pursue growth. Their skill is in pulling 
together the right resources; they’re usually 
good at having people buy-in to their ideas, 
go-getting and highly focused on where 
business is going to come from. They’re not 
usually interested in detail, but in the broad 
sweep of things, and they’re impatient of 
delays and roadblocks. They also think that 
things should be easier than they actually 
are, so they get irritated. They accept fail-
ures and they don’t have to have everything 
fully baked to storm ahead. Things get done 
around serial entrepreneurs. They delegate 
readily, although others can’t always see 
where they’re heading.
As you can see, you need to account for peo-
ple’s strengths and weakness as you build your 
team. Asking them to change just doesn’t work.

You can look for help in a number of places:
	
✓	Barter for services: If you need something tactical, perhaps you know 
someone who’d trade services. Say you’re doing an office redesign for 
a law firm and you need legal advice. How about trading part of your 
fee for their services? Given that you’re making good margins (you are, 
aren’t you?), the hit to your profit may not be all that big.
	
✓	Use independent contractors or a firm: Without making a long-term 
commitment, you can engage a recommended contractor/firm to help 
you with a specific initiative. Just ensure that they understand your busi-
ness well enough to be useful.
	
✓	Think externally in your network: Use your friends and family or other 
business contacts to provide you with support, ideas and advice. Doing 
so is never more important than when you’ve devised a new strategy. 
Who knows, they may even work on your plan, or another aspect of your 
business development, for free.
	
✓	Look inside your organization: People in your company come with a 
significant advantage – they know your business already and so can 
relatively quickly pick up a new responsibility or an update to your 
methodology or process (how you’ve been working up to now with cus-
tomers and prospects). This source is best used for extending existing 
approaches, at least initially. See whether you have individuals who can 
step up to the plate and hit the ball out of the park. If you’ve got people 
like that, you already know who they are. Wait to see evidence of perfor-
mance, and then promote them.
	
✓	Engage new hires: Your business growth needs new talent from time to 
time – initially, perhaps ‘more of the same’, such as a new project man-
ager, a new salesperson, an assistant in finance. Later you may need dif-
ferent skills, new managers, people capable of managing larger clients, 
bringing in bigger deals and implementing sophisticated marketing.
Growth takes a lot of planning so make sure that you have trusted advisors as 
you transition from one form of help to another.
	
Start involving others, even if in a small way. Create a group that cares about 
the outcomes, has the right skills and innate talents, and is willing to help. 
At the very least, find a ‘buddy’ from outside the company – maybe someone 
in a services business with your role, or a trusted advisor – and see whether 
they’re willing to have a monthly meeting with you to share experiences, 
results and challenges.

 Chapter 7: Putting Your Plan into Action
Determining your investment
Before you decide where to invest, take a look at your plan – the revenue 
goals (including customers and prospects that you expect to serve), the 
tactics you want to use, the metrics you want to track – and consider what 
you’re going to need to get to the goal:
	
✓	Most of your cost in a services business is staff. Whether you’re looking 
for some short-term help or long-term employees, growth means spend-
ing money. That means you need a staffing plan, so that you can match 
your personnel needs to your goals and milestones.
	
✓	Think about compensation plans carefully. Be willing to pay a fair wage, 
but also build an incentive for performance – from commissions to bonus 
pools, be willing to share the wealth. Also don’t forget that some people 
are going to incur expenses.
	
✓	You may need new tools, so that you can optimize running your business 
development. From tools that support specific tactics (such as lead quali-
fication questionnaires to determine whether a new lead is one you should 
work on) through to systems (such as your customer relationship manage-
ment (CRM) or accounting ones), growth requires a bit more formality.
	
✓	If you’re going to engage in any kind of marketing, you need a budget. 
Some things are free (well not really, they take time, which is money), 
but online tactics, advertising, printing and sponsorship all require you 
to spend.
After you’ve assembled your investment ideas, scale your budgets to your 
growth. The more revenue you have coming in, the more you need to invest 
to sustain that level of revenue. Unless you’re getting a cash infusion, the 
business is going to have to pay for all this investment.
	
Get help with creating your budgets if you can – a second pair of eyes (espe-
cially ones that don’t wear rose-tinted spectacles) is useful: use your accoun-
tant, your finance person or your life partner to get a dose of reality.
Check out the simple spreadsheet on www.dummies.com/go/

Lift-Off! Launching Your Plan
In this section I cover the essential tasks of communicating your plan, getting 
and using feedback, and starting up your dream team. I don’t advise on how 
to roll out your plan in detail here. Chapter 13 gives you ideas for rolling out a 
new sales team approach – you can use that as a model.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
Flexibility is crucial at the launch stage. A contact from one of the largest 
software companies in the world told me:
People think we’re like an ocean liner – a huge ship that takes time to change 
direction. We’re not. We’re like a small flotilla of yachts and rowboats. 
Someone says, ‘I’m going this way’, and we all say, ‘Sure, let’s do that. That 
looks like a good idea’.
	
Whatever its size, no company should be an unwieldy ocean liner. In the early 
days, it needs to be nimble, opportunistic and able to respond to circum-
stances; with growth comes the challenge of being responsible for employees, 
payroll and competing priorities. Your people are like that flotilla of small 
boats. Point the way, show them what they can get out of it and watch them 
switch direction.
Communicating your plan internally
You’re at the core of directing your business as owner, management-team 
member or business-development leader, trying to change with changing cir-
cumstances. You need to communicate clearly and effectively your plan, your 
ideas and your thoughts on how to move forward to all who need to know.
	
If your plan has been living in your head, now’s the time to start sharing it with 
others, for three reasons:
	
✓	You need support: Moral, expert and hands-on-deck. You have to extend 
your team to drive growth.
	
✓	You need advice from others: Especially those who’ve been there, done 
that, or who know a lot about a specific area in which you’re not an 
expert. You require such input and counsel.
	
✓	You need your people pulling in the same direction if you want your 
business to succeed: Start getting others involved, sharing responsibil-
ity; use the skills and talents that you have around you.
You can implement with a spectacular Big Bang or go slow at a steady trickle. 
Either way, talk to people. Sharing your plan brings others into the picture 
and allows them to get excited about it and start contributing. I appreciate 
that doing so can feel threatening for you – raising troubling questions such 
as ‘Will they like it?’, ‘Will they follow it?’ or ‘Will it work?’ – but do it anyway.
In the final analysis, your people’s concerns are individual: they’re motivated 
by keeping their jobs, paying the rent/mortgage, feeding the family, having 
fun with friends and improving their lot in life.

 Chapter 7: Putting Your Plan into Action
	
People are made anxious when they don’t know the following:
	
✓	Is the company doing well?
	
✓	Does the loss of a customer mean that they’re going to be let go?
	
✓	Are they going to be moved to another project soon?
	
✓	Does their boss like them?
People perform better when they’re kept informed, even more so in tough 
times, and when they think that they can influence the results for themselves 
and for the company. Part of business development is unifying your team 
around common goals, preferably where your staff can see a personal upside 
for their contribution/co-operation.
	
If you expect more than the above – such as staff jumping into new 
responsibilities/adding more work with no clear benefits for doing so – you’re 
going to be disappointed. In the end, people have one question: how is this 
new business development plan going to impact me/benefit me? To be blunt, 
they don’t really care about you and your plan! No, I take that back. They may 
like you, admire you and hope you do well too, but inevitably they have their 
own concerns. Therefore, when you communicate with this fact in mind, you 
see results. And no, I’m not a cynic, just a student of human behavior.
At the strategic level, consider closely how you plan to communicate to the 
whole company – take a second look to make sure that it floats like a balloon 
and won’t fall flat like a pancake.
	
Give people enough of the vision to get them excited, but not so much detail 
that they start falling asleep. If you can, have other members of your manage-
ment team, or new team members, present their parts of the plan. Make part 
of your communication the opportunity to get feedback (see the later section 
‘Making use of friendly feedback’ for doing so effectively).
	
If you have underperformers in your company, you already know who they 
are. These people are highly resistant to change, especially to measurement 
because they don’t want their underperformance discovered. Don’t give them 
any responsibility for management of results; instead, make sure that they 
understand what they have to deliver and if they don’t, follow through with the 
right procedures to move them out of your business. After all, they’re most 
likely unhappy doing a job they’re no good at. You need ‘A’ players at the top 
and ‘B’ or better on the wider team. In services, a ‘C’ doesn’t hack it.
Enrolling ‘friends’
Leadership is lonely and hard. Everyone tends to think that you have power, 
when you don’t. Everyone wants you to make decisions, so that they don’t 
have to take responsibility. All too often, the situation can feel like management

against workers, ‘us’ against ‘them’. Even in the most democratic, structurally 
flat companies, when the going gets tough, you’re the one people blame, espe-
cially if you have to dismiss them. Well, they blame you or the circumstances – 
they rarely point the finger at themselves.
	
So, by all means build your open, sharing, collaborative company, where 
everyone takes responsibility for the results, but in addition, get yourself 
some support that’s worthy of your big game. Think of people you know who 
can be critical in a constructive way, who call you on your mistakes and who 
celebrate your successes with no agenda (other than feeling good that they 
helped).
Assemble a mix of the following people:
	
✓	Coach/mentor: Consider paying someone a modest sum for working 
with you. This person can help you design your goals, metrics and tac-
tics. You want to be able to run ideas by this person, bring up issues for 
discussion and have her hold you accountable for your results.
	
✓	Other business leaders: Look for people who have expertise you don’t, 
valuable market intelligence or experience greater than yours. Use them 
for an occasional lunch and free advice (you pay for lunch!).
	
✓	Formal group of peers: Some organizations offer this service (and 
some include formal coaching too). If they’re too expensive for you, see 
whether you can start one. Maybe your coach/mentor would consider 
leading it. Just ensure that the group has structure and method – it 
shouldn’t be just an opportunity for whining about your businesses.
You can admit failure and worries to these people; they uncover your defi-
ciencies and flaws in your plan. Inside the company, you sometimes have to 
put a brave face on it. Outside, you should be able to be vulnerable and get 
some help. Actually, that’s when you’re at your most powerful – when you’re 
willing to admit you don’t know it all.
You can use these outsiders in any way you see fit – just ensure that how you 
use them makes a difference for you. Be clear about how, where and when you 
need their input. Create your support structure to provide what you need.
Making use of friendly feedback
Your employees and your external support structure will have feedback when 
you share your initial business development plan with them. In Chapter 3, 
I look at feedback from customers, prospects and the team concerning your 
services work. In a similar way, the wider you go for feedback, the better. 
Take it with a pinch of salt, by all means, but take the gems onboard and 
incorporate them. Your plan isn’t the Rosetta Stone – you can change it.

 Chapter 7: Putting Your Plan into Action
	
Structure your requests for feedback so that you can significantly increase the 
value of the responses. For example, try asking your management team and 
external advisors:
	
✓	Do you think that the plan is realistic?
	
✓	What do you think of my goals?
	
✓	Is the roll-out at a good pace or is it too fast?
	
✓	Can you see anything missing?
	
✓	Do you think that I can handle everything else that needs to happen 
alongside this plan?
You usually collect this feedback verbally – with this senior group, conversa-
tions allow for follow-up questions and digging deeper.
	
Split the employees into two categories: those involved in working the plan 
and those it impacts only indirectly. Start with the first group, one on one. 
Share your plan and explain where you need their help. Ask for feedback and 
for them to come back with their ideas.
This approach has a number of advantages:
	
✓	You test your plan with a few key people.
	
✓	You get a reaction (good or bad) that helps you tweak how to share it 
with the wider company.
	
✓	You obtain initial feedback from people who’re going to be involved, 
which should make things easier to implement.
	
✓	You have at least a part of your staff on your side before the wider 
communication.
You also want general feedback from the second category of employees:
	
✓	What do they think?
	
✓	Is anything missing that they think is important? (If they suggest some-
thing, ask whether they’re willing to take that on.)
	
✓	Do they have suggestions to improve the plan?
	
✓	What interests them? What part would they like to be involved in?
	
Often only vocal employees are forthcoming in general meetings; yet the more 
reticent may well have great insights. Consider having a suggestion box open 
for a week, or invite individuals to stop by your office or call you if they ‘think 
of something later’.

Here are two things not to do:
	
✓	Don’t try and sell your plan as if the plan is rock solid. Tell your 
people that you’re making moves to prepare for growth and expansion 
and you’re going to start introducing new tactics and measures to see 
how things go. Tell them that the next three months are going to be a 
pilot, that you’re open to their feedback and ideas, and that the plan will 
be adjusted at the end of three months and further on.
	
✓	Don’t roll out an incentive or bonus plan until your tactics are estab-
lished and starting to show initial results. Tell people whether you’re 
planning an incentive plan and that you’ll share more information in 
three months’ time.
Getting the team going
Most people are excited and energized as a plan approaches implementation. 
Here are some things to do as you launch into action:
	
✓	Do a final update on your plan based on the feedback you’ve had.
	
✓	Choose pilot tactics/tasks wisely. They need to contribute directly to 
the goals and you need to run them for a minimum of six months, with a 
review at three to see whether anything needs adjusting.
	
✓	Make sure that all team members know what they’re accountable for, 
what you’re asking them to do, what they need to report on and when 
to ask for help or raise an alarm. Create a team culture of open com-
munication and questioning: everyone is capable, everyone is an equal 
contributor; explain that your plan is a pilot and won’t be perfect. ‘Your 
company needs YOU!’
	
✓	Ensure that the tools are identified and going into place. You may need 
new spreadsheets, a shared area for files, other systems, better hard-
ware (maybe get the team excited by giving them a new smartphone or 
tablet device). Little things can mean a lot. Above all, supply the team 
with the tools they ask for to do the job (within reason).
	
✓	Enforce monitoring. Everyone on the team and everyone who reports to 
them for this purpose must provide the data that you need to track how 
things are going. Your team members also need to inspect the work. Ask 
questions, provide advice and coach other staff. Start small and spend 
time making sure that you’re doing it right. As you grow, these practices 
extend across the wider company – tweaking them later is easier.

131
 Chapter 7: Putting Your Plan into Action
	
✓	If something isn’t working, deal with it right away. If a problem is ignored 
or a faulty practice is allowed to continue, it becomes ‘how we do things’ 
quickly. Don’t let it become ingrained.
	
✓	If you’re asking people to take on a lot more work (such as a designer to 
update your brochure or your senior project manager to do some seri-
ous number crunching every month), see what you can take off their 
shoulders, or set a deadline for when it will be done or when they’ll get 
help (such as the end of the pilot). Many people willingly work harder 
and longer hours for a short while, but don’t expect it consistently.
Within six months, you know where you are as a business and whether your 
numbers are on track. You’ve probably made some improvements that are 
ratcheting up your results and identified gaps and issues that you need to 
tackle in the next version of the plan.
	
Monitor your people. Over time, you come to rely on them more and more for 
your success. Make sure that they’re enjoying what they’re doing, feeling like 
they’re contributing, and that they’re valued and appropriately compensated. 
Give them progressively more responsibility. Your company isn’t a pyramid 
scheme, but the more you trickle down the responsibility for results, the 
better you do personally.
Considering a few final thoughts 
as the plan takes off
Keep your eye on the goals and milestones while implementing your plan 
(see the earlier section ‘Setting milestones, tactics and metrics’). You built 
it to drive them and now you need to monitor your business and work the 
plan. The more you measure, the more you expose issues. That’s a good thing 
because when you know they exist, you can handle them; if you don’t, how-
ever, they grow with your business and cause a disaster later.
	
Business growth requires more than simply selling and delivering more 
projects: things don’t work that way. Growth brings its own challenges and 
impacts every part of the business (see the sidebar ‘Keeping ambitions realis-
tic’). Be ambitious, yet cautious. Be willing to ask for help and get advice from 
people who’ve traveled this path before you.
You’re starting with a modest plan, built on past performance and driving 
bigger results. What’s good about this approach is that you’re creating the 
foundation for a solid future while you start to extend your approach.

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
Managing Risk while Implementing 
Your Plan
You’re not going to experience only ‘ups’ when putting your business devel-
opment plan into action: ups at some moments inevitably mean downs at 
other times. Sometimes these downs are outside your control, but great com-
panies succeed even in the face of setbacks.
Risks are unpredictable, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t begin to guess 
where problems can arise. Fortunately, thousands of businesses have trod-
den the path before you and you can discover a lot from their issues and mis-
takes. Planning for risks is an important business development activity and 
allows you to see problems coming, while you can do something about them. 
Well, sometimes.
Thinking the unthinkable: What 
can possibly go wrong?
Lots of occurrences can cause problems with plan implementation, but at the 
core three things can throw you off course. Check out Table 7-3 for what to do.
Keeping ambitions realistic
Alan decided that small projects with low profit-
ability were the root of his business problems. 
He had to work hard to get new customers, they 
paid relatively little and expected miracles. His 
clients were mostly small companies, but when 
he’d worked with larger companies in previous 
jobs, they were more realistic, less naïve and 
had deeper pockets.
He hired a sales person from a competitor to 
bring in bigger customers. Within three months, 
the new guy found an opportunity, worked with 
the team to create a proposal with a great big 
budget. They won the deal – it was five times 
larger than anything Alan’s company had ever 
done. Unfortunately, Alan soon discovered that 
how his team went about doing the work was 
too informal. The project was more complex, 
needing more planning upfront and more formal 
management all the way through. The project 
got done but was three months late, the profit-
ability was low and the morale of the team was 
in the toilet.
He couldn’t blame the sales guy – Alan got what 
he’d asked for, but if he’d stepped back on win-
ning the deal and considered who to ask for 
advice, he might have thought things through 
and made the win a real win – for everyone.

Table 7-3	
Three Things that Can Throw Your Plan Off Balance
What Can Happen
Consider
What to Do
You have difficulty 
implementing your plan.
Is it too complex?
Are people resisting the 
work?
Are people resisting the 
measurement?
Are there just not 
enough hours in the 
day?
Ask team members 
what they think would 
make the plan easier. 
Then think about:
	•	 Simplifying the plan
	•	 Tweaking the 
tactics
	•	 Streamlining the 
measurement
	•	 Coaching/changing 
staff
	•	 Eliminating non-
essential activities
You don’t see satisfac-
tory performance and/
or improvement in your 
metrics.
Where is the 
underperformance?
Why is it happening?
Who’s responsible?
What needs adjusting?
Strategize with your 
managers for solutions. 
Consider whether you 
have the right tactic, 
being delivered by the 
right person and being 
managed well.
Something disastrous 
happens (such as losing 
your biggest customer).
Learn from what hap-
pened. Apply ‘panic 
now’ tactics (see 
Chapter 13). Scale back 
your plan and goals. 
Make tough decisions.
Crisis is hard to deal 
with. Try to think 
clearly and keep 
communicating. Be a 
problem-solver.
Dealing with large challenges
Plenty of events can overwhelm a business: the economy, natural disaster, 
the competition, emerging technologies, customers being unpredictable.
	
To discover which of these challenges you really have no control over, con-
sider these questions:
	
✓	Do you have a recession-proof offer?
	
✓	Do you have a disaster-recovery plan?

Part II: Planning for Business Development 
	
✓	Can you manage the competition?
	
✓	Can you keep on top of technology changes?
	
✓	Can you get the right customers?
You can plan around these challenges, although doing so takes time and you 
don’t have a whole load of that. A day’s retreat with the senior team can nail 
a couple of these issues, so that when/if they happen you know what to do.
	
The bottom-line question is how responsible are you willing to be to make 
your business a success? Everyone wants things to be easy, but sometimes 
they just ain’t. How you respond when things are against you is what makes 
you a great leader.
Businesses are vulnerable in the early years and when revenue is low, so your 
top priority is to grow as fast as is reasonable to the point where you have a 
cushion against the big challenges.

Appreciating the Benefits of 
Marketing for Your Business
In This Chapter
▶	Welcoming a new era of sales-orientated marketing
▶	Putting marketing to use as part of business development
▶	Considering whether you need branding
N
 
ot that long ago, many people thought of marketing as being ‘fluffy’, of 
no real substance. When times were good, spending money on fluffy 
stuff was okay – but when money was tight, marketing staff were the first to 
go. But the times, they are a-changing.
At the root of that change is technology; at the epicenter is the connected 
individual. From my couch, I can log onto the web at the drop of a hat, find-
ing out pretty much anything I want to know and then asking my private and 
business networks what they think. I bet you I can find a new apartment, 
view it, submit all the paperwork, order furniture, get services turned on and 
arrange a moving firm, all without leaving that couch. Well, maybe on moving 
day I’d have to haul my backside out of the chair.
But the Internet isn’t only a massive information source – it’s also where 
transactions happen and, increasingly, where prospective customers 
research services. Buyers expect to get to know your business online and 
they make judgments about it without ever talking to you.
Statistics vary as to how much of the business-to-business (B2B) buying 
cycle happens online these days, but for sure the percentage is certainly 
rising, with some estimates putting it as high as 60 per cent. That’s why mar-
keting matters and why you need to include it as part of your business devel-
opment plan. In fact, your business really must engage in marketing if you 
don’t want to get left behind.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
In this chapter, I introduce you to practical and pragmatic marketing for a 
services firm, as well as describe the wide variety of marketing channels 
available that are relevant to services firms. I also demystify the mysterious 
concept of branding – businesses that is, you’ll be glad to know, not livestock.
Working Together in Harmony: 
Marketing and Sales
A myth exists that business development is sales (Chapter 1 explains why 
that’s so widely off the mark). Business development concerns itself with the 
entire customer experience and more (check out Figure 2-1 for the customer 
side and Figure 3-1 for the business development lifecycle).
	
Marketing deals with buyers who’re considering whether to buy, sales deals 
with buyers who know that they will buy. Therefore, marketing is the public 
face of your company. It creates the message of who you are, what you do to 
solve business problems and the value that you offer to your customers. In 
addition, marketing influences the pre-contract phase a lot, including making 
sales much easier, while feeding from the post-contract phase. Therefore, as 
I discuss in this section, marketing needs to work alongside and in collabora-
tion with sales.
	
With your marketing spectacles on for a moment (check in the mirror that 
they’re flattering, of course!), view the lifecycle through the eyes of marketing 
using Figure 8-1. Consider what marketing is thinking at each stage.
The job of marketing is to provide the messaging that goes out to the market, 
no matter what the channel (the vehicle that you use to communicate with 
the market and to generate leads). That messaging includes your firm’s:
	
✓	Website
	
✓	Collateral (brochures and other stuff like that)
	
✓	Events
	
✓	Sales presentations
	
✓	Mass emails
	
✓	Advertising (offline and online)
	
✓	Image, wherever you show up in person
If marketing is doing its job, the work of sales is easier, more focused, more 
streamlined and more effective.

Enjoying the perfect relationship 
(not!): Marketing and sales
Marketing and sales typically have plenty to say about each other. Marketing 
says:
Sales is ‘flying by the seat of their pants’. They make it up as they go 
along. They go ‘off brand’ all the time. They keep shoving things down the 
customer’s throat before they’re ready. They’ll say anything to get a deal. It’s 
like the Wild West out there.
Sales says:
I need leads that are ready to buy. Where are they? What’s marketing doing? 
‘Fannying around with the press releases’ [to quote Bridget Jones’s Diary, 
The Movie]. Nurturing, my eye – what’s the point of that?

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
The relationship has been confrontational for a long time. One of the rea-
sons is that marketing isn’t a quick fix and sales wants quick fixes. In real-
ity, whether you think you’re doing marketing today or not (in other words, 
whether you do or don’t have a formal marketing role in your company), 
sales is spending time writing stuff so that the company can present itself 
credibly. Sometimes what sales creates is okay, sometimes really bad. Almost 
always the copy is created on an as-needed basis and thought of by sales as a 
necessary evil. Either way, sales doesn’t have time for ‘real’ marketing.
	
Aligning sales and marketing is a common thread in really successful services 
firms. Doing so is not an option, but a necessity.
Making your marketing sales-oriented
I think that everyone agrees that you can’t grow your business without sales. 
Small firms have to fight for every deal, and being a salesperson is a really 
thankless job. I put it in the ‘what have you done for me today?’ category. 
You’re not even as good as your last deal – you’re only as good as the one 
you’re about to close.
As the company grows, you want to shift to a ‘large and thriving’ position 
that looks like Table 8-1.
Table 8-1	
Market View of Smaller and Larger Firms
Small, Stable and Fighting
Large and Thriving
Not well known.
People have heard of you.
The list of past customers may be small (evidence 
of competence is thin).
You have an impressive 
portfolio.
The phone isn’t ringing.
Prospects are calling you.
	
Marketing is the function that gets you from column 1 to column 2 in the table 
(and gives the salespeople a look in: yes, they’re important too!). The point 
is that sales has great difficulty selling while simultaneously driving the com-
pany’s business in the right direction. In the most enlightened organizations, 
marketing has a place at the top table, because marketing is the function that 
takes the business strategy and turns it into real actions that build your firm’s 
recognition and reputation in the marketplace.
Reaching parts that sales alone can’t reach
	
Here’s a back-of-the-envelope exercise that is nevertheless very useful. Take a 
look at Table 8-2, which extends the idea of growing from a smaller to a larger 
firm (say, $2 million (£1.26 million) to $20 million (£12.6 million), but by all

means make up your own numbers). My model is simplistic: you get a cus-
tomer, you do your work and you pile up revenue. Your projects are one-time 
and you have to replace your business every year with new customers. So, to 
grow you just have to scale the numbers, right? Note the challenges you see in 
moving from small to large.
Table 8-2	
Moving From Small Firm to Large
Small ($2 Million/£1.26 million)
Large ($20 Million/£12.6 Million)
Average deal size is $100,000 (£63,000).
Average deal size is $100,000 (£63,000).
Number of projects per year = 20.
Number of projects per year = 200.
Most of your customers are existing 
contacts (your network) or referrals.
Most of your customers are 
‘strangers’.
Investment in business development is 
$100,000 (£63,000) (5% of revenue).
Investment in business development 
is $1.5 million (£945,000) (7.5% of 
revenue).
Number of salespeople = 1. 
Commission rate is 3%.
Number of salespeople = 10. 
Commission rate is 5%.
Vice President of Sales? No.
Vice President of Sales? Yes (someone 
has to manage all those salespeople).
Here are some questions that may well have occurred to you:
	
✓	Handling 200 projects a year while maintaining quality? Yikes!
	
✓	Ten salespeople? Is that much business out there? Will they meet their 
sales targets?
	
✓	How do I find time to keep an eye on all those metrics (the target num-
bers you track to make sure that activities are being done)?
You may conclude that doing more of the same (scaling up) doesn’t work. I 
agree. You end up with an unmanageable organization or you plateau at a cer-
tain revenue.
Alternatively, you can expand your geographic reach (that is, increase the 
size of your marketplace), increase your deal size, or try to get more sales of 
higher revenue with fewer salespeople. You can consider any of or all these 
options.
Without doubt, marketing can action your strategy, increasing your reach, 
recognition and revenue compared to using sales alone.

Here’s why:
	
✓	Salespeople can only do so much in a day.
	
✓	Marketing can use high-volume tactics to get out in front of more people.
	
✓	Marketing can nurture leads that may become prospects but are cur-
rently some months, even years, from buying.
Sales needs to cozy up to marketing and look to them to work a few well-chosen 
channels and help produce a healthy stream of leads. Chapter 9 focuses in more 
detail on how effective marketing helps sales and can act as a fundamental 
driver to the growth of your business.
Funnelling more leads with marketing
Marketing is clearly no longer all fluff and no substance – not these days. Modern 
marketing is in the business of driving leads: in the end, the staff are on the hook 
for a result, just like sales. Their job is to attract the market to the company, 
wrap themselves around sales and make sales as efficient as possible.
How does marketing do this? Imagine that a salesperson can handle 20 oppor-
tunities simultaneously and has to have conversations with a minimum of 100 
contacts in his network, or from referrals or any other lead sources he cur-
rently uses, to get those 20 opportunities. The salesperson’s view of his job 
is like Figure 8-2: constantly working to convert leads into prospects at the 
top of the funnel and then to push them down the funnel to a close. Read the 
sidebar ‘To funnel or not to funnel’ for some views on this funnel model.
	
Figure 8-2: 
Sales and 
the funnel.

 Chapter 8: Appreciating the Benefits of Marketing for Your Business
	
From Figures 8-2 and 8-3, what marketing calls a lead (an MQL or marketing-
qualified lead) may not align with what sales thinks a lead looks like (SQL 
or sales-qualified lead). Expect sales to throw back some leads as not ‘sales 
ready’. Sales is looking for leads (SQLs) that are ready to buy within a reason-
ably short timeframe; marketing is scoring leads based on how they’re inter-
acting with marketing campaigns. These different criteria explain the gap.
Salespeople typically use channels such as attending local events, calling on 
their network from prior jobs, asking people for referrals, working with part-
ners, using social media to get introductions, cold calling local companies – 
all to produce leads that they can convert into prospects.
Marketing can use more channels, more technology and more automation to 
reach much wider, as in Figure 8-3.

Now you’ve enough leads for three salespeople. You’ve a great big funnel on 
top of a narrower one, with a steady stream of leads (those marketing quali-
fied leads) to the sales team. For more on how this is done in practice, check 
out Chapters 11 and 12.
Historically, in business-to-business sales, marketing has been seen as nice to 
have, rather than the necessity is actually is. Mad Men adverts for the latest 
perfume are all very well – that’s consumer marketing. These days, though, 
marketing has the technical power to become part of the engine of growth: 
and this power is happening right now. Make sure that you understand mar-
keting so that you can use it when the time is right and not get left behind 
(Chapter 11 has loads more information).
	
When is the right time to start serious marketing? You may think that the 
answer is when your sales tactics can no longer keep up with your hunger for 
prospects, but actually the right time is about a year before that. Marketing 
isn’t a quick fix – marketing is a long-term strategy and a key function of busi-
ness development. You need to invest before you see returns. Having said 
that, you can take some early marketing steps before you get all sophisticated, 
some of which I describe in the next section, to get you jump-started.
Setting Out Your Stall: Marketing 
for Services Firms
Marketing is a daily experience for people these days. Every day, you’re bom-
barded with messages intended to influence you into making a purchase. It 
can be extremely subtle – savvy marketing can sell you something without 
you knowing you’re being sold to. As a consumer, if you’re buying something 
To funnel or not to funnel
The funnel model has been around for nearly 
100 years and not everyone subscribes to 
it anymore. The problem is that it treats the 
customer-buying journey as if it’s consistent 
or linear, whereas these days it seems much 
more erratic, with customers jumping from 
social media to websites to webinars to blogs 
and being in the middle of the funnel when they 
first encounter you. What they’re doing, though, 
remains consistent with the stage in the buying 
cycle that they’re at – they just happen to have 
a lot more channels available to get information.
To my mind, therefore, the funnel is still a worth-
while model – at least until someone comes up 
with a really good replacement. The debate 
rages online if you’re interested: just Google ‘is 
the sales funnel dead’.

 Chapter 8: Appreciating the Benefits of Marketing for Your Business
complex or high-ticket (such as a car or the latest tablet device), the retailer 
typically needs salespeople to help you make the right choice. With smaller 
purchases, you don’t always need salespeople. Marketing can do the whole 
job, from the first twinkle in the eye to the final purchase. QED.
When a customer buys for his company, the money isn’t his own and the con-
sequences of getting it wrong can be serious. The B2B buying cycle is often 
long, with many people contributing to the decision. In B2B, the sale is just 
more complex.
	
The same applies – only more so – for services. In B2B product sales, the pro-
cess can be much more like B2C (business-to-consumer), unless the product is 
also very complex or needs a hefty dose of services to implement.
In this section I cover marketing basics to consider as part of your business 
development, such as choosing techniques that work for you, creating a suc-
cessful team, understanding the vitally important role of technology and the 
importance of using your contacts and building partnerships.
Selecting the best marketing 
techniques for you
You spend a lot of time enticing customers to buy, and so you’d better invest 
your time and money in the right marketing tactics and channels for you and 
your company.
Start by working out:
	
✓	Where your customers are to be found
	
✓	What information they need
	
✓	Why they need it
	
✓	Where they go to get answers (publications, events, websites, influenc-
ers and so on)
	
Use your customer profile, your research from Chapters 3 and 4, and your 
(thoughtful) analysis of their needs and your offer from Chapter 5. You’re then 
well prepared to start thinking about how to use marketing.
You have to have the foundation before you can build the marketing bridge 
that contacts can walk across to become leads and then serious prospects/
customers. At the very minimum, you need the pillars in Figure 8-4.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
	
Figure 8-4: 
Your market-
ing bridge.
	
Your four pillars are:
	
✓	Clarity about what problems you solve and what you offer
	
✓	A consistent way of talking about your offer and services
	
✓	A website that tells your story more fully – in other words that’s clear 
about what you do and helps customers understand why they may 
need you
	
✓	Some basic collateral and possibly broader content, such as a brochure, 
services sheets (if you’ve more than one service or serve different 
industries), testimonials/customer stories (case studies), white papers 
and ebooks
You may have all these and more. Even so, step back and ask yourself 
whether your foundational pieces are actually talking to the customer and 
making clear how you can fulfill the customer’s need.
Energizing your team
If you need to do work on your foundational pieces (see the preceding sec-
tion), or if you don’t know where to start, go to your internal team. Assemble 
people from all around the business development lifecycle: representatives 
of leadership, marketing, sales, delivery, quality and administration all have 
something to say.
	
Prepare for your meeting as follows:
	
✓	Create a title for your meeting: For example, ‘The Health of Our 
Marketing’.
	
✓	Set a clear brief for marketing: For example, ‘To position our company, 
educate, inform and communicate with our market, inspire and support 
our leads, prospects, customers and employees’.

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
147
 Chapter 8: Appreciating the Benefits of Marketing for Your Business
	
✓	Create an agenda: Consider what customers need at each stage of the 
lifecycle (that marketing can deliver):
	
–	When they’re educating themselves
	
–	When they first talk to us
	
–	When we’re giving them a proposal
	
–	When we’re at contract stage
	
–	When we’re delivering the work
	
–	When we’re completing the work
You’ll be amazed at what comes up at the meeting.
	
Bill was trying to improve upselling to his customers. When he sold a specific 
service, he tended to get ‘pigeonholed’, that is, the customers didn’t know 
that his company did anything else. When he consulted with his team, his 
delivery folks suggested two things:
	
1.	To get really good case studies (the salespeople get them, why don’t 
we?).
	
2.	To put customers on an email list for a newsletter to tell them more 
about the company, our ideas, all the things we do, how we help.
Bill passed case studies to his delivery team right away and had his assistant 
start working on a newsletter format and list. Within two months, he’d sold a 
new service to two of his existing customers.
	
Get feedback from your team and use it to set some immediate priorities 
(because you’ll have more ideas than you know what to do with). Make the 
ongoing effort a two-way street – get your team to send you anything that the 
customer says or puts in an email about your company, what it needs next, 
who it likes working with and so on. Marketing, like Number 5 in the film Short 
Circuit, needs input. Your customers can provide that input:
	
✓	Testimonials
	
✓	Accolades for individual staff members or the whole team
	
✓	Case studies
	
✓	Opportunities for more business
Think about what’s needed for your customers to do more business with you. 
Also, consider what would make it easy for your customers to refer you to 
other prospects in their network? A little stack of postcards with your infor-
mation? An email or newsletter they can forward to someone else? Don’t be 
shy to ask for their help.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
	
If a team get-together is impractical, you can do your own brainstorming. You 
need to take every point around the lifecycle into account, thinking from your 
team members’ perspectives.
Using your network
I mention the importance of your contacts in a number of places throughout 
this book. From a marketing perspective, your network and the networks of 
your whole company – and the network of all those networks combined – 
is your secret marketing weapon. So how do you leverage that extended 
community?
To start, you want to analyze what your network looks like. I hope you’re on 
LinkedIn and that you’re connected to everyone you know in your business 
community (and probably to some people you don’t know too).
	
If you’re not on LinkedIn yet, get a copy of LinkedIn For Dummies by Joel 
Elad (Wiley) or consult the LinkedIn Cheat Sheet at www.dummies.com/
cheatsheet/linkedin and get set up within the next seven days. Take a 
look at other companies like yours and see what they’re saying about them-
selves. Then look at some larger companies in your space or close by (I call 
them ‘aspirational’). Craft your company profile and your personal profile. 
Start searching for people to connect with (LinkedIn has ways of making con-
necting easy). Look for some groups to join. You can do the same steps for 
other social networks later, but LinkedIn is the most important and most likely 
to lead to results faster. If you’ve no idea where to start, collar a 20-something 
and ask for help – that’s if they’ve a collar handy.
Start reviewing the people and firms that you’re connected to, whether online 
or offline, and see which contacts are most promising as potential marketers 
for your services. They’re the ones who:
	
✓	Have a lot of connections who may be prospects for you
	
✓	Would be willing to share your information with others in their network
	
Your message has to be pretty compelling (that is, it has to pass the ‘Really? 
You do that?’ test). If you think that your message is not yet quite that grip-
ping, check out Chapter 5 and get it honed to a sharp edge.
Narrow your network down to 5–10 people who are active, well connected 
and respected. You may want a mix of:
	
✓	Mavens, namely experts in their fields known for sharing knowledge
	
✓	Companies you need services from and may be able to provide service to

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
149
 Chapter 8: Appreciating the Benefits of Marketing for Your Business
	
✓	People with the job titles you want to connect to
	
✓	High-profile speakers and business networkers
Ask them for some of their time. Tell them about your business expansion 
plans and your latest clients. Ask about theirs. Ask what they think you 
should do. Ask what you can do to help them.
Go to a networking meeting with them and get into their network – always 
follow up if they give you a referral and thank them if they help you. Work 
these 5–10 contacts for 3–6 months; at that point, you’ll have witnessed some 
great practices from these leaders (and some things not to do), and you’re 
ready for social marketing (see Chapter 10 to plan that).
	
Including companies you may need services from allows you the potential to 
barter for services as long as they need something you offer. Try to include a 
good marketing firm that’s worked with companies like yours, if you can. Just 
be sure that the contact you’re using is one you know and trust not to try to 
sell you something you can’t afford right now.
Forming partnerships and alliances
Some of your network (see the preceding section) may include partners or 
alliances. Partnerships typically fall into two categories as shown in Table 8-3.
Table 8-3	
Why Partnerships Are Valuable
Category of Partnership
Benefits
Companies who do something adja-
cent to what you do, but are minimally 
competitive with you. Perhaps they sell 
services that have to be done before 
(or alongside, or after) yours.
You can potentially sell bigger deals 
together. You can refer work to each 
other.
They offer a product that you imple-
ment or that you’re considering imple-
menting to extend your services.
They’re a source of leads (or can be). 
They may promote you or have market-
ing dollars to allocate to you so that 
you can promote yourself.
Select 1–2 of your top partners to court and nurture, and seriously work the 
relationships – partnerships are about the people, not about whole companies. 
Use what they have (ethically) where you can – their network, their database

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
of contacts, their marketing and their collateral. With partners, you’re going 
for a win-win, and so engaging with them isn’t too hard. You can bet a lot of 
other firms are waiting around for leads, but not being proactive with their 
partnerships.
Alliances are business relationships that often started as a partnership, 
but deepened into a more formal agreement. Where you detect a desire to 
improve customer service, share costs, do work together on a regular basis 
or leverage each other’s assets, an alliance, which often has a formal legal 
basis, can be a good move. They’re more common with larger companies 
where the parties have something highly valuable to offer each other.
I devote Part VI of this book to partnerships, so that’s the place to look if the 
issue of partnerships is an important channel for you.
	
Some companies are very resistant to partnerships where they have to ‘give 
away’ business. They want to keep all the goodies for themselves, even if that 
means trying to do work they’re not best qualified to do. My experience is that 
companies that share work, partner and expand their networks with a willing-
ness to contribute to others, with no agenda, are the ones that expand. After 
all, if someone points you to a large lucrative contract, wouldn’t you try and 
see what you can do in return? Give someone something and you put them 
under an obligation to reciprocate. Believe me, they’ll want to.
Understanding technology 
and the online dimension
More and more people are using the Internet to make purchasing transac-
tions. Right down to your pizza for Friday night, you’re probably spending 
time online as part of that process. In addition, prospective customers are 
increasingly researching services online.
Statistics indicate that most prospects are 66 percent of their way through the 
buying process by the time they connect with you other than in cyberspace – 
leaving you with a 33 percent window to make the sale.
Marketing departments have figured out that if they can get at the buyers in 
the 66 percent, give them what they’re looking for and build trust at a one-to-
one level, the value of marketing to the organization skyrockets.
A short time ago, marketing was fairly simple: you had your website, banner 
advertisements, search results, blogs and webinars. Now the online map 
is very complex and online/offline are integrating in highly creative ways. 
Figure 8-5 shows a highly simplified online map.

Figure 8-5: 
Online chan-
nel map.
	
	
Now that you’re officially overwhelmed (I get that way every time I look at 
a diagram, even one as highly simplified as this one), you need to get to the 
basics and figure out where online your prospects hang out, your competitors 
engage and your partners show up:
	
✓	Use LinkedIn (see the earlier section ‘Using your network’), and maybe 
Twitter too, to track individuals and see what groups they belong to, 
who/what they’re following, how active they are.
	
✓	Search to find out what forums, publishing sites and blogs they’re likely 
to be reading/contributing to.
	
✓	Search to find out where prospects may be going when they’re trying to 
fix their problem (the one you solve). Which websites, blogs and forums, 
LinkedIn groups do they visit and what are they reading?
	
Create your own online map. It may look something like Figure 8-6. Note that 
I’ve added an offline dimension too, because offline channels are online now 
too! Go find them. For example, if you have a local Chamber of Commerce, is it 
a potential channel for you? What is it doing online?

Figure 8-6: 
Your online 
channels.
	
Choose three to six online channels that you think may have potential for 
you, now or down the road. Explore what’s happening in your local com-
munity too – such as perhaps joining local groups, attending local events or 
offering special deals to local customers. In the US, the boards of non-profit 
companies are also a great place to meet and nurture local contacts of note.
	
As with LinkedIn, For Dummies has a book and cheat sheet for Twitter too. If 
hash tags have you all confused, get a copy of Twitter For Dummies by Laura 
Fitton, Michael E Gruen and Leslie Poston or Twitter Marketing For Dummies by 
Kyle Lacy (both Wiley).
Finding some quick wins in marketing
Planning marketing is definitely a challenge for people who didn’t study it 
in college or university. But you can score quick wins in some areas without 
reading umpteen books or spending a lot of money. Here are three areas to 
look at:
	
✓	Getting some outbound emails going: Take a look at incoming marketing 
emails for a period of time. What do you instantly delete? What do you 
bother to read? Get registered with an email service such as Constant 
Contact, iContact or MailChimp. Create a simple newsletter (it can simply 
take the form of an update from you – just make sure that the content 
is likely to be interesting to your audience). Compile a customer email 
list and start by sending something out to customers every couple of 
months. Chances are that you get some reaction from a few of them – 
while you’re building your confidence about using the email system. 
You’ll need to be very confident in using email marketing later.

153
 Chapter 8: Appreciating the Benefits of Marketing for Your Business
	
✓	Creating some content that can be useful to sales immediately: When 
you have a prospect, what’s going to help push the sale along? Do you 
have great questionnaires for gathering the prospect’s details? Do you 
have industry specific stories that you can write? Have you done things 
for specific prospects as a one-off that may be worth creating as a 
template (such as a return-on-investment calculator). These customer-
centered sales aids are pieces that marketing should prepare, or at least 
help sales with.
	
✓	Boosting your LinkedIn visibility: People respond to LinkedIn 
emails much more than they do to regular email. You just need to get 
connected:
	
–	Get well established on LinkedIn (your own and company pro-
files). If you need help, check out the earlier section ‘Using your 
network’.
	
–	Start building your network. Be choosy; don’t just connect to 
everyone.
	
–	Use LinkedIn to research every contact you’re about to talk to 
or meet in person. Connect to them just before meeting them or 
immediately afterwards.
	
–	Move to doing occasional status updates on your own profile or 
your company profile, maybe weekly or every other week.
	
–	Join some groups. Stay focused and keep things light to start with. 
Get a sense of which groups are worth the time before you start 
contributing.
	
–	Create standard email text for request-to-connect messages and for 
InMail emails (LinkedIn’s own internal email system).
	
–	Elevate your account to a paid level – you see much more informa-
tion and can go beyond your direct network.
Like any tactics, these ones work only if you follow through and do them 
rigorously.
	
With any electronic communication, make sure that you follow the rules. 
LinkedIn, Twitter and email communications all have their own etiquette and 
legal restrictions, so read those terms and conditions before you jump in with 
both feet.
If the three approaches in the list aren’t for you, choose some others. One 
thing’s for sure – plenty of options are out there!

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
Deciding whether Your 
Firm Needs Branding
For a lot of small businesses, the idea of even considering ‘brand’ as a con-
cept may seem laughable. After all, don’t only big companies spend lots of 
money creating a brand?
	
If you’re unsure whether you need to think about your brand as part of busi-
ness development, consider that an important responsibility as your business 
grows is to take care of your positioning in the marketplace. When the market 
isn’t clear about your offer, you have a problem. You end up talking to a lot of 
people who want something like your services, but not exactly your services, 
or end up delivering what you thought customers wanted when they were 
expecting something else.
In this section, I help you decide whether branding is for you.
Understanding the importance of brands
In Chapter 5, I suggest that when customers buy your services, they’re 
buying a lot more than their immediate or obvious need dictates. An emo-
tional/psychological dimension is always attached to a purchase, and usually 
this dimension is hidden.
I see brand as creating emotional associations between you and your custom-
ers. You can find a lot of definitions, but here’s one that works well:
Brand is a promise. By identifying and authenticating a product or service it 
delivers a pledge of satisfaction and quality.
— Walter Landor
Of course, identifying the promise behind a burger or a car, a spa massage 
or a visit to Disneyland is fairly easy. Identifying the promise of a service to a 
business can be a bit trickier, but it’s a valuable exercise nevertheless.
Whether you need to worry about brand today, or in the future, depends on 
where you are in your business’s evolution. For a young company (say less 
than three years old), you don’t have enough track record, enough consis-
tency, to build a reliable brand, unless your services are very straightforward 
and the value is very easy to articulate. As you mature, you should be better 
able put into words what you stand for.

 Chapter 8: Appreciating the Benefits of Marketing for Your Business
	
Working on your brand becomes important when you start extending the 
awareness of your company, to partners, local and national business leaders, 
and when you start speaking at local events, advertising, creating and devel-
oping your online presence.
Identifying yourself with a brand
	
A brand needs to convey utility and be emotionally fulfilling at the same time. 
It needs to represent company ethos, values, capabilities and ways of doing 
things. Above all, it needs to communicate to customers an honest representa-
tion of who you are.
If, when your company name comes up in conversation, people say, ‘Never 
heard of them; what do they do?’, you’ve a blank slate for creating your 
brand. Your customers and a few prior prospects know who you are and 
that’s about it. If pre-conceived notions exist about who you are, things are a 
little harder but shifting ideas is always possible.
In creating your brand, you’re trying to shift the conversation from ‘I’ve never 
heard of them’ to ‘They’re the company that . . . ’ to ‘I’ve heard they’re really 
good at . . . ’.
	
Jan’s company is known for exemplary services to its customers. The delivery 
team makes sure that customers have a great experience. Deep in the ethic of 
the company is that the firm bends over backwards to make customers happy, 
so when it created the brand message, it was encapsulated in ‘A better experi-
ence’. The company can honestly say that it delivers that in every aspect of its 
services. Nine out of ten of the firm’s customers give it referrals that turn into 
new customers. Now that’s a powerful brand.
I can’t do justice to brand building in a couple of pages, but a For Dummies 
book does. Although dealing primarily with consumer-facing brands, Branding 
For Dummies by Bill Chiaravalle and Barbara Findlay Schenck (Wiley) walks 
you through everything you need to know about brand building.
Marketing your brand
Ultimately, everything that goes out into the marketplace with your name 
on it needs to be consistent with your brand. You also have to live up to the 
promise of your brand in everything you do:

✓	Do: Get everyone inside the company to buy into the brand promise and 
to uphold it in everything they do.
	
✓	Don’t: Tinker with it. When you have a brand, stick with it.
Creating a brand normally requires some outside help, so expect to spend 
several tens of thousands of dollars on that help.

 etting results for your business requires an alignment with your cus-
tomers around the customer experience, as in Figure 2-1. Problem is, 
in the early stages, you don’t know them well – so how can you know what 
they’re thinking; what do you put in front of them; and what do you say to 
them? Fortunately, two well-developed disciplines can help you answer these 
questions: marketing and sales. Like two sides of a coin, they’re inextricably 
joined.
In small businesses, one person often executes marketing and sales – initially 
the owner, maybe later on a head of sales. Such firms may not even use the 
word marketing, but that’s what they’re doing a lot of the time. In fact, often 
businesses hire a salesperson long before considering hiring a marketing 
person. Unfortunately, this sequence has the potential to set up marketing as 
the unwanted child, always playing second fiddle to sales.
With business growth, the sales and marketing departments tend to get sepa-
rated in an organization and sometimes don’t communicate as well as they 
should. In the worst case, they don’t talk the same language, they don’t have 
the same goals, they have (often inaccurate) opinions about each other and 
they fight over who’s really driving the results. I describe strategies for han-
dling this problem in Chapter 12 – as you can imagine, the problem is impor-
tant enough to deserve a chapter of its own.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
In this chapter, I distinguish sales and marketing and focus on what market-
ing can do to make sales a hero. I look at how marketing and sales ideally 
relate to the customer lifecycle and the value that marketing can provide to 
sales and to your business as a whole.
Revving up the Marketing Engine
The ultimate goal of marketing, as with any aspect of business development, 
is to drive revenue. Marketing contributes to that goal by taking responsibil-
ity for the following five key areas:
	
✓	Market intelligence: Investigating what’s happening in the marketplace; 
who’s buying what, when and how; the trends in your space; and what 
the marketplace is saying about your area of work.
	
✓	Customer intelligence: Gathering intelligence from your customers and 
prospects as a feedback loop.
	
✓	Positioning and messaging: Ensuring consistent, powerful and relevant 
positioning and messaging to the marketplace. Marketing is the guardian 
of your ‘brand’, whether this brand is fully developed or an internally 
agreed set of promises. Chapter 8 has more on branding.
	
✓	Marketing programs: Marketing develops and runs specific marketing 
programs, namely overarching marketing initiatives to fulfill on a specific 
strategy; and campaigns, namely individual marketing activities (such 
as email campaigns) that are part of the larger program. Marketing pro-
grams are initiatives designed from information gleaned from the three 
areas above that, when launched, reach out to the marketplace. They 
push out messaging, create awareness and create demand (namely 
leads).
	
✓	Lead generation: From marketing programs, sales gets qualified leads 
that it can develop into closed deals.
The first four areas above are the foundation for generating successful leads. 
Marketing needs to divide its time between these areas – neglect any one and 
the results are going to be less effective.
	
Marketing doesn’t work in isolation: it’s dependent on intelligence from a 
number of sources and feedback from programs to refine the approach con-
stantly. Ultimately, if marketing isn’t driving leads, whether directly or indi-
rectly, it’s not doing its job.
In this section I clarify the different, though complementary, roles of sales 
and marketing, how successful marketing works and what it requires to func-
tion at top efficiency.

 Chapter 9: Driving Sales Success with Effective Marketing
Appreciating the differences between 
sales and marketing
Whether marketing is being effective in generating leads is a complex issue. All 
too often, salespeople don’t trust marketing to make a significant contribution 
to company results – they think that marketing is a waste of money. Marketing 
doesn’t always appreciate that salespeople are on the hook for results.
	
As your business grows, you need to make sure that:
	
✓	Marketing and sales collaborate and communicate.
	
✓	Marketing and sales have shared goals and are clear as to individual 
accountabilities that contribute to the goal. That means having specific 
metrics, such as number of leads expected per month, conversions into 
opportunities and won deals.
	
✓	Marketing and sales each take responsibility for its portion of the 
results, which means being accountable and measurable. Sales is used 
to that – marketing less so. You’re responsible for ensuring that it hap-
pens. Check out the later section ‘‘How will I know that marketing is 
achieving its goals?’ Measuring marketing’ for more.
Table 9-1 illustrates a few differences between marketing and sales that you 
need to take into account.

If you’re thinking that marketing and sales people have different personalities, 
you’re right. Those personalities ‘sell’ their value rather differently. Salespeople 
tend to be particularly good at selling themselves – no surprise there! So 
beware: they can drown marketing’s voice and opinions. Give marketing a 
chance to put its point of view – marketing people are worth listening to.
Marketing and sales are highly valuable disciplines, and when they appreci-
ate each other’s strengths and capabilities they can jointly produce signifi-
cant results. But don’t take my word for it: here are two expert quotes from 
the Sales Benchmark Index blog ‘Top 5 priorities for CMO-CSO Alignment’, 
January 2014 (CMO is chief marketing officer and in this context CSO is chief 
sales officer). According to the Aberdeen Group:
Highly aligned organizations achieved an average of 32% annual revenue 
growth – while less well-aligned companies reported an average 7% decline 
in revenue.
Sirius Decision research reports similar findings:
B2B organizations with tightly aligned sales and marketing operations 
achieved 24% faster three-year revenue growth and 27% faster three-year 
profit growth.
	
So the clear message is: get marketing and sales to work together. To start, 
clarify what marketing should be doing and how you’re going to measure it. 
In Figure 8-1 I show how marketing thinks about the business development 
lifecycle – take a quick look at that figure.
Now check out Figure 9-1, a mini-lifecycle for marketing and sales. Marketing 
communicates with the whole marketplace (your prospective customers, part-
ners and other parties that need to be aware of your business). Marketing’s 
goal is to generate marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) to hand over to sales. Sales 
takes those leads and either works on converting them to prospects (that is, 
they qualify as sales-qualified leads, or SQLs) and then become customers) or 
hands them back to marketing as being not quite mature enough yet – I discuss 
this issue in Chapter 12.
	
Naturally, this description is a gross simplification, but if you keep this con-
cept in your mind, you’ll find making sure that marketing is doing the right 
things a whole lot easier.
Ensuring that marketing drives results
Marketing can’t just create leads out of nowhere. It needs to create a strategy 
for tackling the marketplace that’s appropriate to your business. Smaller 
businesses don’t usually have vast amounts of money to pour into marketing.

 Chapter 9: Driving Sales Success with Effective Marketing
Therefore, you have to ensure that you choose the strategy and tactics care-
fully and that each has associated goals, metrics, feedback mechanisms and 
tangible results you can analyze to see whether your investment is paying off.
	
Figure 9-1: 
The mini-
lifecycle –  
marketing 
and sales 
(MQLs = 
marketing-
qualified 
leads;  
SQLs = 
sales-­
qualified 
leads).
	
	
Having said that, don’t expect immediate results from marketing. As I describe 
in Chapter 8, marketing has a much wider reach than sales and is dealing with 
significant complexity in designing its strategy. The department also takes 
care of a longer portion of the pre-contract phase (time-wise) than sales. For 
example, when your sales cycle (SQL to signed contract) is three months, your 
marketing cycle (contact/target customer to MQL) is probably 9–24 months.
So when it comes to lead generation, you need a hefty dose of patience and 
a willingness to invest despite being unsure about whether the investment is 
going to pay off.
	
Don’t start a marketing effort and then pull out three months later. You have 
to give it at least 12 months before you start switching strategy. That doesn’t 
mean that you can’t tweak your tactics based on results, however – indeed, 
you should.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
To discover the four essential areas that you need to consider before mar-
keting can generate leads, check out the earlier ‘Revving up the Marketing 
Engine’ section.
Tuning up the marketing engine
Marketing is like an engine that’s designed to take an input and create an 
output. As Figure 9-2 shows, marketing needs fuel to drive the engine.
	
Figure 9-2: 
The market-
ing engine.
	
A side product from the marketing engine is the feedback from the market-
place and the measurability of the results. These outputs represent the all-
important feedback loop.
	
Each time you design a marketing program (focused on specific business 
goals) and the campaign (the series of marketing activities designed to sup-
port the program), ensure that the engine has everything it needs to function 
well.
	
Imagine that you’re an employment agency and that you offer services to help 
your customers be up-to-date with current employment legislation in your 
local area. Have a think about what sort of marketing program you’d construct 
to serve existing clients and attract new ones.
You have a lot of options – Figure 9-3 shows one possible program that uses a 
few channels to build up to a webinar and follow-up afterwards.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
This simple program embodies a few key principles. To start, count up 
how many:
	
✓	Contacts you have in your original list.
	
✓	Emails that get opened.
	
✓	Click-throughs you get. In other words, if your email has a link to a web 
page (for example), your email marketing software is able to tell you 
who has ‘clicked through’ to that web page.
	
✓	People registered for the webinar.
	
✓	People who attended.
	
✓	People who viewed the webinar later.
	
✓	Follow-up calls that resulted in a conversation and how many of those 
wanted a further follow-up.
	
The intent of the program is to progress from awareness (creating a need for 
information/expert help) through to driving leads. If a call with a prospective 
customer resulted in that person asking for further help, this request is a clear 
opening to pass that lead to sales, which can bring in a subject-matter expert 
and see whether it can sell some services.
Sales and marketing should try to agree in advance what a qualified lead looks 
like. In some cases, sales only wants to talk to people who are some way into 
the buying cycle – other times, it wants to jump onto a vague interest, because 
it thinks it can convert that vague curiosity into a real opportunity. The key 
is to have marketing and sales collaborate over the design of programs. At 
the absolute minimum, make sure that you agree when lead handover is 
appropriate.
	
Marketing and sales use the term BANT to describe the perfect qualified lead – 
the person has budget, authority, need and timing that fit your criteria for an 
SQL.
Designing a program like the one in Figure 9-3 requires a lot more than creat-
ing hypothetical steps. If you have questions such as, ‘Where’s the list going 
to come from?’, ‘Who’s going to write all those emails?’, ‘How do I put on a 
successful webinar?’, you’re no doubt aware of the large amount of work this 
kind of design can entail.
Right now, however, I just want you to get a sense of how a marketing engine 
works and what you need to be thinking about when you design programs.
	
Don’t be overambitious when you start creating your own marketing strategy 
(see Chapter 10). Start small and learn from experience. You’re trying to figure 
out what works for you.

Carrying out the hard work of marketing
Before you can begin constructing a marketing program or its supporting 
campaigns, marketing needs to help you deepen your understanding of the 
market (check out Table 9-2).
Table 9-2

What It Gives Back

nies with which you want to do busi-

involvement in the buying cycle and

The engine can start running only when all this background work is done, 
programs are planned, content is written and systems are in place. Marketing 
is always looking to be several steps ahead of the buyers, and so it needs to 
create content that buyers value (and ideally wouldn’t be able to find any-
where else). With so much information available online these days, writing 
engaging content is getting more and more difficult.
	
You know that you have the right team when you’re proud of what you see 
coming out of marketing, even while you’re asking, ‘Where are my results?’ 
If you’re the one doing the marketing, keep extending and deepening your 
knowledge of it and the value it brings to your growing business. This 
way, when you do come to hire marketing people, you know what you’re 
looking for.
Setting Accountabilities between  
Sales and Marketing
Naturally you want your business to grow year after year. You probably 
already have a sense of where you’re trying to end up in a year’s time (read 
Chapter 6 for how to plan your numbers). Up to now, you may have operated 
on a wing and a prayer hoping that the coming year’s results will be better 
than last year’s, but without a plan for accomplishing that goal. If so, time to 
use some business development practices to strategize and then operate to 
fulfill your goals.
Say your goal is higher revenue, which translates into an accountability that 
salespeople call their quota – the net new sales they have to achieve this year. 
That number is on the shoulders of whoever is responsible for sales, or pos-
sibly split between sales and account/project managers who look after deliv-
ery to your clients. When things aren’t on track, everyone scowls at the sales 
folks. I know what that feels like – I’ve been there. Fortunately, marketing is 
now able to take its share of the responsibility for generating leads, which the 
salespeople can convert into closed deals. As I describe in this section, mar-
keting can be responsible for generating leads that drive a specific percent-
age of the number.
	
Driving leads isn’t marketing’s only goal. It also needs to research, inform and 
support sales and delivery to sell more.

167
 Chapter 9: Driving Sales Success with Effective Marketing
What am I striving for?  
Establishing the goal
In Chapter 6, I look at creating your goal(s) and some of the measures you can 
use to see whether you’re staying on track. With marketing, you definitely 
want a few soft goals, but you also want the ultimate prize – qualified leads 
(I define the latter in the earlier section ‘Appreciating the differences between 
sales and marketing’).
Start with an overarching statement of your marketing priorities for the year, 
so that you, marketing and sales are aligned. I summarize here a couple of 
examples from two businesses (from the Hubspot research project ‘2014 
Planning Insights from Marketers Like You’):
	
✓	If you can’t measure a campaign or program, don’t do it. You have to 
show ROI (return on investment) so that every marketing activity con-
tributes to a business goal. Lead generation and conversion to a sale are 
the priority; providing relevant content throughout the customer jour-
ney is the tactic for driving leads and supporting conversions.
	
✓	Marketing efforts combine content with context consistently to deliver 
the right content to the right people at the right time. Increase your 
focus more on buyer personas, and deliver compelling content that 
motivates your audience to go from information to action.
Delivering the right content to the right people at the right time is something 
I touch on in Chapter 11. Notice also how marketing and sales need to be 
focused on business goals. Say that your goal is to add $2 million in revenue 
this year. Marketing says ‘how will we do that?’ Their strategy is to increase 
demand; the marketing plan will consist of programs and their associated 
campaigns with a goal to increase demand.
Having an overall priority for marketing helps you to choose the right goals, 
which need to include a mix of strategic and tactical goals, some that are 
softer and some that have hard metrics. Review your overall business goals, 
determine your marketing priority and tie marketing’s goals to those busi-
ness goals. A few suggestions are:
	
✓	Locating net new customers: Requires a flow of leads, so definitely set 
targets for how many leads you want marketing to generate. Consider 
how many sales you need and back that into how many leads you need 
to produce. For example, if you start with marketing leads (say 300 con-
tacts) and convert 5 percent of them to MQLs (15 marketing-qualified 
leads, which convert at 66 percent to SQLs (10 sales-qualified leads), 
www.ebook777.com

168
Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
which convert at 50 percent to opportunities (5), which converts at a 
20 percent close rate to one sale. These numbers are the average across 
a wide variety of types and sizes of firms. Know your numbers.
	
	Be realistic: set a goal that’s higher than prior performance, but don’t 
expect marketing to generate all the leads – 25 per cent of leads coming 
from marketing is a good figure to try as a starting point.
	
✓	Creating a new service or an expansion into new geographies: 
Requires a whole new marketing strategy. Set a budget and timeline for 
getting through the strategy and into the execution stage.
	
✓	Enhancing your web strategy and social presence: Needs a timeline 
and budget. Separate the initial project (getting things set up) from the 
ongoing activity of maintenance (adding new content, posting new blogs 
and so on).
	
✓	Keeping your content fresh and up-to-date: Requires a content develop-
ment calendar, ongoing research, review of feedback and writing/content 
development effort. Make sure that the content is directly relevant to 
your key goals (namely, it can be used in programs and campaigns to 
drive the engagement you’re looking for from the marketplace).
	
Craft your own marketing goals and then figure out how you can measure 
them.
‘How will I know that marketing is  
achieving its goals?’ Measuring 
marketing
A natural tension exists between the ‘do it once, do it right’ mentality of mar-
keting (which tends to take time and consume dollars) and the desire to get 
to the market ahead of the competition: this tension is the conflict between 
entrepreneurship and the careful crafting of the marketing strategy. Neither 
side is wrong; both positions are valid. In the end, the goal has to trump 
perfection though, and so marketing needs to deliver in a timely manner. 
Sometimes you just have to be willing to get out there. Try saying, ‘this is a 
pilot’ – it gives you freedom to not get it absolutely right first time.
	
Marketing is getting increasingly interested in and engaged in measuring results. 
Don’t hire an old-school marketer (who gets uncomfortable when asked to be 
accountable for results). Make sure that your marketing people have that focus 
and eagerness to contribute to business goals and don’t resist the concept of 
goals and metrics.
The key thing is to establish goals, communicate them, set up ways of mea-
suring that they’re happening and inspect them regularly. Table 9-3 contains 
some examples of marketing goals.

‘Lead’ can mean something different to marketing than it does to sales. A con-
tact filling in a form on your website asking for someone to call them may be 
a ‘lead’ from marketing’s standpoint (an MQL) but probably isn’t a lead from 
a sales perspective (an SQL). I cover these different ideas about what consti-
tutes a lead in Chapter 12.
You need to give marketing time for the engine to warm up and start produc-
ing results. Far more subtle forms of influence go on in the early stages in the 
buying cycle than in a ‘let’s get to it’ sales process. Fortitude and respect is 
needed all round.
Ensuring that Marketing 
Generates Interest
As I state in Chapter 8, a natural division exists between buyers who’re 
still thinking about whether to buy and ones that know they will buy; in 
simple terms, marketing deals with the former, sales with the latter (although 
note that marketing can be supportive of the sales process and in customer 
­retention and upsell, too).
	
In traditional marketing speak, marketing drives awareness. It highlights, 
sometimes even creates, the need; it educates the customer about potential 
solutions and it makes her aware that your business exists and that you may 
have the right solution for her. Marketing also needs to collaborate closely 
with sales, choosing the right moment to hand over a lead.
‘Hey, we’re over here!’ Getting attention
Conventionally, the purchase funnel, Figure 8-4, was just that, a funnel, and 
marketing and sales saw their jobs as pushing customers down the funnel 
to purchase, using well-designed marketing and sales techniques. Today, the 
view is rather different:
	
✓	Buyers speak to their friends and family and do a whole load of research 
online after they identify a need and determine that they have to do 
something about it. Marketing needs to insert your company into that 
buyer research phase.
	
✓	Focus for new sales has shifted from the initial purchase towards loyalty 
and repurchase considerations. In other words, you may get increased 
business from your existing customers more easily than from new ones 
(although you need those too!). Both marketing and sales are giving 
existing customers more attention. Not only might they buy more, 
they’re also great advocates for your services.

 Chapter 9: Driving Sales Success with Effective Marketing
Figure 9-4 compares the traditional way of thinking about buyers (just get 
them to the purchase) with a full-lifecycle model (you take care of them 
throughout the lifecycle). This doesn’t just stop and sell, deliver and we’re 
done. No, it includes the ‘loyalty cycle’, where a buyer can re-purchase over 
and over and recommend and refer you to others. Worth some attention, 
don’t you think?
To create awareness of your solution (or brand), marketing needs to be mes-
saging prospective customers so that when they’re triggered – that is, they 
make the decision to buy to fulfill their need – your company is on the list as 
a possible solution.
	
Figure 9-4: 
Traditional 
purchase 
funnel 
versus full-
lifecycle 
purchase 
model.
	
	
A marketing program or campaign is directed at different points in the aware-
ness stage, from the point when the customer doesn’t yet know that she has a 
need, to being ready to engage actively with someone in your organization so 
that she can evaluate and then choose you or eliminate you from the running. 
Naturally, not everyone is going to be interested in everything you put out 
into the marketplace, but you can start to examine what specific contacts pay 
attention to (from their behavior, such as clicking through on an email) and 
extrapolate where they are in the buying cycle (from the content you provide).
To use the example from the earlier Figure 9-3, if as a potential customer I 
open an email with information about the new legislation, I’m trying to educate 
myself to discover whether I have a need (do I have to do something about 
www.ebook777.com

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
this?). If I attend a webinar titled ‘How to Implement the New Legislation’, I 
probably know that I have to do something. These two communications are 
trying to capture people at different stages in the buying cycle.
In the most sophisticated marketing programs, the degree to which indi-
vidual buyers respond to them – for example, whether they open an email 
and click-through, or attend a webinar, or fill in a web form asking someone 
to contact them – results in an ever-increasing ‘score’ associated with that 
individual. As you’d imagine, someone who responds to all the opportunities 
to communicate with you is a warmer lead than one who ignores you com-
pletely or whose engagement is minimal.
	
The skill of marketing is to create the kind of valuable content to which buyers 
respond, to get it in front of them when and where they need it, and to recog-
nize when the time is right to hand the lead over to sales.
‘Over to you!’ Timing lead 
handover correctly
Marketing and sales need to agree when a lead gets transferred from market-
ing to sales to follow up on. Based on the programs you design in Chapter 10, 
you may well base the transition point on the buyer’s actions. Table 9-4 con-
tains a few simple examples.
Table 9-4	
To Hand Over or Not To Hand Over (a Lead)
Customer Action
Hand Over?
Opens an email that you sent linking to 
a case study, white paper or webinar 
registration.
Probably not. They looked at your email 
but didn’t act on it. Keep messaging 
them.
Attended an online seminar/presenta-
tion (webinar).
Maybe/maybe not. Certainly worth 
calling attendees to see where they 
are in the buying cycle and qualify fur-
ther. Sales doesn’t necessarily have to 
take on this task.
Signed up on your website for some-
one to contact them.
Maybe. Sales usually wants access 
to proactive leads right away, but 
make sure that marketing is capturing 
enough data, such as name, title, com-
pany, phone, email and purchase time-
frame, even budget. If you have several 
services, a checkbox for what the lead 
is interested in may be helpful too.

Hand Over?
Attended a trade show and spoke to a 
marketing person at your booth. Said 
they’re buying your type of services 
within three months.
Yes and quickly. Sales should follow 
up, but be aware that prospects get 
excited at trade shows and they may 
not be quite so ready when sales calls 
them. You just have to decide whether 
sales or marketing is to nurture them.
Use Table 9-4 to create agreement between marketing and sales on when a 
lead is ready to be handed over, based on your own marketing activities. 
Critically, when a lead is deemed to be ready for sales, it must promise to 
follow-up every time and treat the lead like a diamond in the rough. If the lead 
isn’t ready for the sales process, sales can hand it back to marketing.
	
Contacts may jump into the buying lifecycle at any stage – they may not track 
with the process from start to finish.
I look further at the topic of leads and how marketing and sales need to 
handle them in Chapter 12 (after you outline your programs in Chapter 10).

Creating Your Marketing Plan
In This Chapter
▶	Deciding on your marketing priorities and tactics
▶	Developing and implementing your marketing plan
▶	Allocating the necessary funds
T
 
his chapter follows on from Chapter 9 and helps you to create your own 
marketing plan. You need to align your marketing plan with your busi-
ness goals, so that the tactics you choose as part of your plan directly impact 
your results and help you fulfill your overall goals.
I show you how to translate those business goals into a marketing priority 
and a plan, consisting of practical marketing tactics (programs and their 
associated campaigns), which you can activate with the right people and 
financial resources.
	
If engaging in marketing feels like reaching for the moon, think of it more 
like getting into orbit. Chapter 9 discusses how modern marketing works, so 
unless you’re already familiar with this area I suggest that you read that chap-
ter before this one.
Preparing To Market Your Business
Often, marketing teams undertake activities because they seemed like a good 
idea at the time. Although nothing’s wrong with being opportunistic (some-
times it even pays off), marketing shouldn’t involve jumping from one activity 
to another without an underpinning priority and plan.
Here’s what you need to start working on your marketing plan:
	
✓	Clear business goals with associated metrics (see Chapter 6)
	
✓	An internal SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) 
analysis on your own marketing as it is today
www.ebook777.com

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
176
Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
	
✓	An understanding of the competitive landscape and other market forces 
(see Chapter 5)
	
✓	A good understanding of the different buyers that participate from the 
customer side in the purchase process (see Chapter 5)
	
✓	An outline of the customer’s lifecycle (see Figure 2-1)
	
As your marketing planning comes together, you may notice that your over-
all goals and marketing priorities are somewhat fixed (at least for a good 
while), but that the tactics (the channels you use or the specific campaigns 
you run) are entirely flexible and can be tweaked based on how well they 
perform.
Read on to discover the basics of a great marketing plan, including the impor-
tance of defining it accurately, researching marketing opportunities properly, 
and thinking seriously about channels and tactics.
Defining your plan
Time to visit your business goals for the next year (Chapter 6 describes how 
to create them). These goals are the foundation for your marketing plan.
Here are a few things you may want to achieve:
	
✓	Grow revenue in your current market
	
✓	Retain current customers and expand your revenue from your existing 
customer base
	
✓	Expand into a new region or industry
	
✓	Add a new service (but tread carefully – see Chapter 5)
	
✓	Expand relationships with your partners, or add new ones
	
Choose one or two goals that are most important to your company for the 
year. If you’re expanding what you already do, you may be able to tackle three 
goals. If you’re breaking new ground, such as moving into a geographic patch 
where you’re not known or launching a new service, that one goal may be all-
consuming for marketing and anything else may be too much to tackle (along-
side its day-to-day activities).
Your goals help marketing to define its priority for the year. Take a look at the 
examples in Table 10-1.

 Chapter 10: Creating Your Marketing Plan
Table 10-1	
Examples of Creating Marketing Priorities  
	
from Business Goals
Business Goal
Marketing Priority
Increase revenue by 30% over the 
previous year using existing services 
and geographic reach. A good goal for 
a new marketing department.
Enhance marketing messaging around 
programs and enlarge your contact 
database with the right target compa-
nies and contacts.
Expand into the mid-West market with 
a goal to open a sales office by the end 
of the year. More appropriate for an 
established marketing department.
Develop mid-West marketing plan and 
programs for brand establishment and 
recognition, while sustaining existing 
markets.
Offer a new service in your current 
geography. Again, more appropri-
ate for an established marketing 
department.
Develop new service marketing plan 
and programs for brand establishment 
and recognition, while sustaining exist-
ing services.
	
At this point, start selling your marketing plan to your staff. One of the biggest 
failings of marketing is when it neglects the internal customers: people in your 
organization who are going to use the developed marketing tactics, who are 
direct recipients of leads that marketing generates or who can contribute valu-
able information to marketing.
Researching marketing opportunities
Your customers are an important resource in your planning: after all, they’ve 
already bought from you. If you haven’t yet done so, talk to a few customers 
about the steps they went through before signing a contract with you.
	
Be systematic about stepping through those early stages, because that’s the 
part of the customer experience that marketing has the most power to influ-
ence. If you’ve more than one buyer in a customer organization, try to talk 
to everyone who was involved when that customer bought from you. You 
can use the customer interview questionnaire at www.dummies.com/go/
businessdevelopment.
Here’s what you’re trying to discover:
	
✓	What caused customers to realize that they had a need? What pain can 
they no longer tolerate?
	
✓	Where did they look to find out what solutions existed, what others were 
doing and what may be a good fit for them?
www.ebook777.com

178
Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
	
✓	What actions did they take along the journey? Did they read particular 
publications, go to certain conferences or attend specific webinars?
	
✓	How did they select certain services firms to talk to (yours included)? 
How did they find out about you?
	
✓	When they contacted you, what did they appreciate about your interac-
tions? What would they have wanted more of? What was missing?
	
✓	Why did they choose you?
Capture your notes on the interview form (you use them in Chapter 11).
	
When your marketing is just getting going, you want to capitalize on this 
information and create your plan to match the ways in which customers have 
historically looked for services like yours. Implementing or expanding already-
proven channels is a great way to boost your pipeline of opportunities and 
hence your short-term growth. Don’t forget to take your SWOT into account –  
your weaknesses may limit what you can do today or tomorrow, but your 
SWOT gives you some clues as to where to expand your marketing capabili-
ties. Use your strengths first and start working on the weaknesses.
While you’re about it, consider also what your competitors are doing. Do you 
see ads in the local newspaper or trade magazines? Do they belong to the 
Chamber of Commerce? Can you sign up for a newsletter online (a private 
email address, as opposed to your business email, is useful here) or attend a 
presentation they’re giving?
Just following the model of what’s been working up to now, for you or your 
competitors, may be more than enough for the first year. If you’ve the capac-
ity to swing out a bit, you can add one or two new ideas, but don’t overwhelm 
yourself. If you’ve never created and run a webinar series, for example, be 
aware that such an endeavor is a lot of work.
So, carry out a sanity check. Are you busy today? Tomorrow? Be realistic 
about what you can afford, what you can take on, what you can get help with 
and how well you’re able to manage and monitor your results.
	
Don’t do marketing without measuring (check out Chapter 9). If you do, you 
can get to the end of the year and have no idea what’s working and what isn’t. 
Measurement helps you save money on unproductive efforts.
Before you decide what marketing channels you’re going to use, assess your 
readiness in terms of your collateral, namely foundational marketing pieces 
(basic collateral and broader content such as a brochure, services sheets, 
testimonials/customer stories, white papers, ebooks), and capture your first 
thoughts about channels you think may work for you (see Figure 8-6).

 Chapter 10: Creating Your Marketing Plan
Choosing your channels
At this point in planning your marketing plan, here’s what you have: your 
value and offer, your business goals, your marketing priorities, a realistic 
view on where you are with your collateral as well as initial ideas for chan-
nels that you can use, such as local ads, your website, blogs or a speaking 
event. That’s a great start.
So what’s next? Well, today’s marketing is all about:
	
✓	Valuable content that entices your contacts to continue paying attention 
to you and motivates them to go from information to action
	
✓	Marketing efforts that treat each relationship as unique, often called 
1-to-1 marketing
Traditional channels are still important, of course, but pushing content to 
larger audiences when your time and budget is limited takes a technical, 
online approach.
Content as your source of powerful communication
You know your business, so you’re the best judge of whether you have con-
tent of value to offer that you can turn into ‘thought leadership’ pieces (by 
that I mean ideas that are cutting edge that can be turned into white papers, 
blogs or ebooks). Sustaining a relationship with someone who’s not yet in 
the buying cycle, or is being slow and steady in the early stages, is hard with-
out some pretty compelling content. This area is where marketing people 
have great skill – they can tease out of your organization (you, your subject 
matter experts and your customers) the kind of content that provides unique 
insights into what your contacts (prospective customers) should be con-
cerned about when they think about their needs/pains.
Compelling content comes from what Influence Ecology, an education company, 
calls specialized knowledge, as opposed to general knowledge. Specialized knowl-
edge is the skills, training, credentials and know-how that your company has 
that others don’t (and your customers definitely don’t!). General knowledge is 
knowledge that’s usually expected for people who are involved in business, such 
as a basic understanding of bookkeeping, or how to go about hiring staff.
	
Imagine that you run a bookkeeping business. It’s likely (though not inevi-
table) that your knowledge is of a general nature and your customers can get 
your type of services from many places. Therefore, you can’t charge much 
more than the going rate – in other words, you’re a bit of a commodity. Your 
value may be that you service your clients so well that they save thousands in 
accounting/taxation service fees each year. If so, that’s your content of value.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
In contrast, now imagine that you run bookkeeping services only for the film 
and video production industry. You have specialized knowledge: you under-
stand this area’s cost accounting, how and when funding comes in, how it 
gets distributed to contractors, vendors and other costs, how royalties work, 
what distribution channels exist and how their fee structures operate. You 
probably know all the pitfalls of bookkeeping in this specific area. In this case, 
that’s your content of value.
The marketing approach in these two cases needs to be quite different 
(the first uses direct positioning to a wide audience, the second uses 
narrow deep nurturing). These requirements call for different approaches, 
channels and tactics.
Talking to customers 1-to-1
You may find that you have some great content and are ready to blast it out 
to the marketplace, and yet you’re often disappointed with the results. Why 
is that?
	
Although you may feel that your company is the greatest thing since sliced 
bread (and I have no doubt it is), the marketplace is only interested if you’ve 
something that solves a widespread, current and pressing problem. Sometimes 
potential customers don’t even know that they have a problem, such as, for 
example, how they can use the overwhelming desire to be connected in cyber-
space 24 hours a day, which is rapidly becoming a must-have for the entire 
human population. Does an opportunity exist there?
More likely, though, your solution solves a specific issue that occurs at a 
point in time for a narrow and specific segment of the market. Even within 
the domain of companies that fit the profile for your services, only a certain 
percentage are anywhere near the buying cycle at any given moment.
So although traditional marketing channels, such as advertising, are still 
important and can be effective, given that in the services area the stake is so 
much about people, the marketing approach is becoming increasingly per-
sonal too.
The good news is that you can tell where individuals from a target company 
are (whether they’re somewhere near or in the buying cycle, or completely 
uninterested) by their behavior. Being able to capture where they are and 
message them appropriately based on their interest at that time is the foun-
dation of behavioral, or 1-to-1, marketing.
Although communicating with prospective customers one-on-one may seem 
like an impossible feat, the advance of marketing technologies is bringing 
that practice within the reach of even quite small companies. The technology

 Chapter 10: Creating Your Marketing Plan
brings one-on-one communication together with marketing automation, that 
is, the tools that manage communication with the marketplace in an auto-
mated fashion. If that sounds good to you, turn to Chapter 11.
	
By the way, Peppers and Rogers started the 1-to-1 movement back in 1993. 
The firm’s website (www.peppersandrogersgroup.com) is a mine of useful 
information on whole lifecycle customer management.
From theory to practice
Enough of the flights of fancy. Perhaps you’re thinking: ‘What am I realistically 
going to be able to do in the next year in terms of expanding our marketing?’ 
One thing’s for sure, you can make only so many phone calls and attend only 
so many networking events, and so my comments about automated market-
ing aren’t entirely pie-in-the-sky.
	
Apart from meeting you directly, what sorts of channels and content are 
most compelling for buyers? A great infographic from Content Crossroads 
provides the following analysis: business-to-business buying decisions are 
influenced by white papers (70 percent), case studies (56 percent), blog 
posts (48 percent), webinars (40 percent) and videos (39 percent). Check 
out the whole infographic at: www.contentcrossroads.com/2013/06/
infographic-wealthiest-content-in-b2b-marketing.
To expand beyond your personal reach, here’s a list of the basic things you 
need to put in place to start devising your plan. They’re also a good founda-
tion to grow into sophisticated marketing in 2–3 years’ time, when your rev-
enue justifies such an investment.
	
✓	Get a solid website that can deliver your content on demand to your 
marketplace.
	
✓	Create and keep adding to your portfolio of case studies or testimonials.
	
✓	Hone your thought-leadership position. What do you want to say to the 
market that’s useful for firms to know around your services? What’s the 
underlying story that makes your offer compelling?
	
✓	Choose content vehicles that you think will work for your type of busi-
ness. Consider white papers, ebooks, infographics, blogs and webinar 
presentations.
	
✓	Choose the channels that best distribute your content. Figure 8-6 has a 
few of the most common online channels used by services firms.
	
✓	Choose your sales management tool (see the sidebar in Chapter 13 for 
details) and email solution (for example, MailChimp, Constant Contact, 
iContact or, if you want an automated solution, see Chapter 11).

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
Later on in this chapter (in the ‘Creating your marketing programs’ section), I 
dig into more detailed preparation of your content and channels.
	
You may notice that some types of content (for example, blog or webinar) are 
also channels (technically, a weblog is the channel and a blog is the specific 
article that you ‘post’ onto the weblog). Every non-personal channel requires 
some sort of content, but the reason for distinguishing them is so that you 
carefully consider whether you have good content for that channel. No point 
putting on a webinar if you’ve nothing fascinating and compelling to talk 
about. Think about it like this – whatever you have to say that prospective 
customers value is the place you need to look to develop content.
Brainstorming your tactics
You now need to go to a deeper level of detail with the channels and content 
that you selected in the preceding section. Some of your channels deliver 
content direct to the target customers, but don’t forget that human interven-
tion is necessary at key points in the buying cycle, especially as that cus-
tomer progresses along the buyer journey. In practice, your content will be 
used in multiple channels and at multiple points in the journey – for example, 
when someone writes a compelling blog post, expect your sales people and 
account managers to share it individually with their critical contacts.
	
Before you start detailing your plan, here are a few things to bear in mind:
	
✓	Different channels work best at different stages of the buyer’s journey. 
For example, blogs are great for early stages, because they’re educa-
tional, webinars work well when the customer is really looking for solu-
tions, but prior to them making any direct contact with vendors.
	
✓	You can repurpose contact across channels and sometimes across 
stages. For example, you can write up webinar content as a white paper, 
break it down into a number of blogs, share it on social networks and 
weave it into your website. Look for every such opportunity – it saves a 
huge amount of content development overload.
	
✓	Think about your content from the point of view of each persona (role) 
within the prospective customer, depending on how important those 
roles are in the decision-making process. Often, early stage of research is 
done by an individual who’s not the ultimate decision-maker, so content 
at different stages has to address each persona’s interests and concerns. 
Look at Chapter 5 where I talk about mapping your key buyer personas 
and getting inside their heads. Have those personas in your mind as you 
work on the plan. In the following try-this exercise, do it several times 
for each persona.

 Chapter 10: Creating Your Marketing Plan
I discuss the planning of tactics in two stages. As I say, no point using a 
­channel if you don’t have something appropriate to say. Your business 
wouldn’t benefit from that channel, anyway; or perhaps you can use it later, 
as you grow.
	
So, starting with content, use Figure 10-1 to work out what you have already or 
what you can develop relatively easily.

your 
content.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
Naturally, you need to focus on the essential items: your collateral, marked 
with an (E). If you’re light on those, focus on getting those done for the 
next three months and then revisit the content map. If you’re unclear about 
the distinction between collateral and content, take a look at the sidebar 
‘Distinguishing collateral and content’.
	
Picking the channels to use depends on a number of factors:
	
✓	What content you have.
	
✓	What channels you believe your personas use. For example, in some 
industries, social media are hardly used – yet!
	
✓	The resources you have in your company that can actively feed those 
channels with content.
You may start in a spirit of optimism and ambition, which is perfect; that pro-
vides you with a future roadmap. However, see where I discuss what it takes 
to implement your plan in the next section.
Use Figure 10-2 to select your channels. I give you a jump start, but you need 
to adapt it to your business, so add and take away as you see fit.
Again, make sure that the essentials – the (E) items – are in your sights short 
term and that you pick sparingly from the others, unless you can quickly 
repurpose content from one channel to another.
Distinguishing collateral and content
In terms of what you say in the public arena 
about yourself as a business, I want to distin-
guish between collateral and content:
	✓	Collateral: Items that provide evidence of 
your capabilities and competence in the 
marketplace, because this evidence is 
especially important in the sales lifecycle. 
Examples include your website, LinkedIn 
Company Profile, services sheets, case 
studies, corporate presentations, sales kits, 
including customer questionnaires, pricing 
tools, ROI (return on investment) calcula-
tors and proposal templates.
	✓	Content: Dynamic material of value at dif-
ferent stages of the customer lifecycle, but 
especially important in early positioning, 
that is, in marketing campaigns. Examples 
include landing pages, blogs, white papers, 
thought-leadership pieces, one-off speeches 
(at an event), email text, press releases.
The examples of collateral and content aren’t 
hard and fast: salespeople use collateral rou-
tinely and predictably in the sales cycle; they’re 
also really pleased to have a stream of fresh, 
valuable content to share with prospects and 
customers.

Keep your staff informed as to what content is going out into the marketplace 
and who such content is being directed to. For one thing, it gives them the 
opportunity to use that content themselves to continue to woo prospects and 
customers by adding yet more value. Also, consult your sales and account 
managers about what communications need to go to prospects and customers 
that are ‘in play’.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
Nothing is more disconcerting to sales than an email going from marketing to 
a prospect that introduces your company and services when that prospect is 
about to buy. The prospects’ response is often ‘Doesn’t your left hand know 
what your right is doing?’ My policy is to disable marketing communications 
after a prospect is a Sales Qualified Lead (in the sales process). One type of 
communication is valuable for all your contacts, though, at whatever stage 
in the buying cycle, and that’s a general newsletter. Just ensure that it makes 
compelling reading.
Putting Marketing into Practice
Having content and channels is all very well (see the preceding section). But 
here I discuss how you move from there into specific marketing programs 
that create awareness of the problems you solve, the considerations that 
prospective customers should take into account, and consideration of your 
brand and services.
	
Your specific strategies and goals have a big influence on your marketing pro-
grams. Expanding your services in your current marketplace to a wider group 
of customers is one thing, but introducing a new service or breaking into a 
new geography or vertical (industry) is quite another.
Creating your marketing programs
A marketing program is an assembly of specific tactics that drive towards a 
common business goal and marketing priority. Therefore you need a separate 
marketing program for each of your goals, which is why I suggest that you 
don’t have too many goals on the go at once.
Campaign basics
A program may use different campaigns to drive towards the same goals. A 
campaign is a series of activities that markets a service using specific chan-
nels and methods. Campaigns can be centered on specific topics of thought 
leadership, namely your unique perspective and cutting-edge ideas (such as 
the one I discuss for the HR company in Chapter 5 alerting the market to new 
legislation). You can think of the thought-leadership topic as a theme for your 
campaign.
	
Each campaign needs to include:
	
✓	A goal and objectives for the campaign
	
✓	The results you want to produce
	
✓	The focus of the campaign

 Chapter 10: Creating Your Marketing Plan
	
✓	The campaign duration (how many weeks or months you’re going to 
run it)
	
✓	Who the campaign is directed at (the companies and personas)
	
✓	The campaign assets you need (they’re often called anchor assets – in 
other words the key types of content that are required)
	
✓	A campaign calendar (see the next section)
Your campaign grows
In this section, I help you develop your program and specific campaigns 
designed to fulfill on that program down to an actionable level of detail. Note 
that your program may contain multiple campaigns.
A practical example is the best way to illustrate the development of a market-
ing program and its supporting campaigns. Read the following example and 
tailor it to suit the specific needs of your firm.
	
Imagine you recently joined the local Department of Education in Facilities 
Planning in Chicago and the city has a new school to build. The overall build-
ing stock is pretty aged, but you need to find out whether the new school can 
use the latest best practices. The County Planning Department wants the new 
premises certified as a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) 
building, but you don’t know anything about that, other than it’s connected to 
environmental friendliness. You’ll be on the decision committee for choosing 
an architect.
All around you in the area are some highly competent architects who prob-
ably want to bid on the project. You want to be prepared and so you check 
out the LEED website. You need less than two minutes to figure out just how 
much is involved and so you start looking for architects who are certified as 
LEED consultants.
Now switch roles and imagine that you’re one of those architect firms. You 
have a goal to secure $1million (£630,000) of LEED design projects (hopefully 
leading to construction projects). Therefore, your marketing priority is to 
increase leads and your marketing program needs to consist of a number of 
campaigns to drive those leads.
So, dealing with an early-stage buyer, such as the new guy at the Department 
of Education in Facilities Planning, what would cause him to take an interest 
in your company? Here are my ideas:
	
✓	LEED certification (clearly): Shows your competence to design such a 
project.
	
✓	Experience in building schools: In other words, case studies.
	
✓	Helpful content: To educate a novice about the important things to 
know about LEED, especially for education departments.

What sort of a campaign would the architect’s firm create to reach its goal of 
winning more school construction projects? In Table 10-2, I provide an outline 
campaign plan, which you can use as a model for creating your own.
Table 10-2	
A Marketing Campaign Plan
Strategic Aspects
Description of the Example Campaign
A goal and objectives for the

To drive three design project sales in the mid-West 
in the next 12 months
The results you want to 
produce
Engagement by 20 education departments in at 
least two content items
The focus of the campaign
Creating awareness of LEED and understanding 
why you need to engage an experienced firm 
with certified LEED consultants and local pres-
ence in the target states
The campaign duration (how 
many weeks or months you 
run the campaign)
Six months
Who you’re directing the 
campaign at (the companies

Planning officers and other decision-makers in 
the seven target mid-West states
The campaign assets you 
need
Assets to demonstrate:
	✓	 Knowledge and trustworthiness (willing to 
share domain knowledge)
	✓	 Impartiality (willing to provide useful 
resources with no expectation of a return)
	✓	 Relevant experience (able to tell a convincing 
story based on prior work)
So far, so good. Now I speculate on what your campaign assets may be. No 
right answer here, of course, so if you come to a different conclusion that just 
proves the diversity of the marketing options:
	
✓	A set of video recordings (or a webinar series) covering:
	
–	What is LEED and what aspects are relevant to school construction 
projects?
	
–	What does constructing a LEED-rated building mean in practice?

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
189
 Chapter 10: Creating Your Marketing Plan
	
–	How does the rating system work for LEED buildings, with exam-
ples of some rated schools?
	
–	How would an education department partner for LEED construction? 
What would we need to understand about LEED accreditation?
	
✓	Content for the customer’s Request for Proposal (RFP) for a LEED-rated 
construction project.
	
✓	‘Ten Things to Ask your Architects about Their LEED Work.’
	
✓	Video of a prior client talking about its building project and LEED rating.
If you review this list carefully, you can see that the different items are aimed 
at different stages in the buyer’s journey:
	
✓	Set of video recordings: Directed to the research/planning stage.
	
✓	Content for your RFP and ‘Ten Things to Ask your Architects . . .’: 
Related to reaching out/engaging.
	
✓	Video of a prior client: Most relevant to engage/partner.
That’s not to say that certain assets aren’t valuable across the buying cycle, 
or even into the delivery stage. For example, perhaps the video series can be 
a good education piece for the architect firm to share with a new customer.
	
You may notice that I use video for two of the asset categories. If you can gain 
some economy of scale with a particular tactic, that’s a good thing. You can 
just as easily create infographics for one and a video for the other. If you have 
internal people who are a dab hand at some of this stuff, even better. You 
always have a multitude of options.
	
Also, aim to create progressive assets, in other words ones that you can use to 
nurture prospective customers through the buyer journey. Although you may 
not be quite ready for fully automated marketing, get into the useful habit of 
thinking in sequential steps, because your marketing makes more sense to the 
target audiences that way. You can’t guarantee where and when a specific target 
is going to engage with your content, but you certainly find out something 
about them when they do.
Campaign channels
Your mind may be racing ahead to which channels to use for this campaign 
and all this content. Well, it depends on the nature of your company, your 
previous experience and your resources. Table 10-3 shows a few options that 
the architectural firm can choose.

Landing page
You can create a specific landing

themselves before they can use 
your content.
Your website or marketing auto-

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
For smaller companies, I recommend a separate plan for each campaign (or 
possibly a group of campaigns relating to a single program).
Campaign tips and tricks
Here are a few things to remember when you put your campaigns into action:
	
✓	If you’re using emails, you have to give contacts an opportunity to opt 
out of your communications. It’s the law.
	
✓	Focus any calling effort on the most active contacts. Although it takes 
work, keep track of who opens what emails and whether they click 
through to your content. Most emails systems give you this sort 
of reporting. Someone who opens two emails and watches two of 
your videos and then downloads ‘Ten Things to Ask Architects. . .’ 
is more valuable than someone who opens your emails but never 
clicks through. Note exactly which campaign elements your contacts 
acted on and, from Figure 10-3, what stage that means they’re at. Your 
conversation with them needs to be different for each wave of the 
campaign.
	
✓	Emailing your messages several times is okay (you can make small 
changes each time). People often intend to look at your content but 
then don’t get round to it. For regular content, two emails are probably 
enough; for events, you can email three, even four times (a week apart) 
to remind people to register.
Your campaigns don’t have to consist of emails drawing your prospective 
customers to your content. They can include a lot of other elements too, 
such as a press release, article in a periodical or blog posts. Ideally, though, 
you want to let people know about your content, wherever you’re publishing 
it, and so email marketing is a core skill to master.
Creating your marketing calendar
With some planned campaigns, you want to pull them all together into a 
marketing calendar. Not only does this calendar show you the schedule for 
all the campaigns you’re running, but also you can add other marketing 
work into the calendar, such as a revision to your website, or writing new 
collateral.
A calendar also allows you to spot any peaks of activity that may exceed 
what the team can deliver. For instance, if you have a webinar going on, con-
tent being put together for your new website, a press release to be written

193
 Chapter 10: Creating Your Marketing Plan
and a couple of case studies that are due, plus two new email campaigns 
launching, you may well be over-reaching. Use your calendar to move things 
around to balance out the workload.
	
Don’t forget that certain times of year can be slow in terms of getting the 
attention of your target market. If most of the industry you’re targeting 
goes off to a major annual conference the second week in March, avoid 
that time for pushing out content (unless you’re going to be exhibiting at 
the conference, in which case you need a whole campaign around that). 
Different industries have different financial cycles (for example, the public 
sector compared with the commercial sector). Take major national holidays, 
summer and late December/early January into account. Use December to 
plan your marketing campaigns and calendar for the following year.
Your calendar typically spans a 12-month period. You can be as granular as 
you like – just ensure that you’ve enough detail to avoid major tasks getting 
overlooked. If a marketing individual is managing the calendar and marketing 
effort full-time, you can leave the detail to that person. If this job is a part-
time effort for someone, or a weekend activity for you, the more detailed the 
calendar, the better.
Figure 10-4 shows part of a simple spreadsheet marketing calendar for the 
architect example in the preceding section.

The calendar starts to reveal just how much work is involved in even the sim-
plest campaigns. The one for the architect firm probably takes hundreds of

194
Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
hours of planning, not including video shoots. When the calendar’s all set up, 
the time then goes into running the separate waves (stages of the campaign, 
usually distinct and separate activities), monitoring results, managing the 
database (for example, opt-outs – people who don’t want your emails – and 
bounces – emails that haven’t been delivered) and producing reports for 
others who have to act on the results of the campaign.
	
During the planning stage, check whether you’re being over-ambitious. 
Running one campaign really well is better than doing three badly. I go even 
deeper into campaign development in Chapter 11.
Creating and managing 
collateral and content
Your company has a clear focus for its services and specific value that it 
brings to its customers. You may also have a mission and vision defining who 
you are. You don’t want to have to alter this bedrock of your company for a 
long period of time. Even so, the world is changing and the market creates 
more and more sophisticated and automated ways of getting your message, 
maybe even your services, to the marketplace.
	
You absolutely must have some collateral to sell effectively, otherwise you 
look unprofessional. You should have content to influence a prospective buyer 
to consider you and to keep your messaging new and interesting. For a further 
clarification on collateral and content, read the earlier sidebar ‘Distinguishing 
collateral and content’ and see Chapter 11 for more on the importance of 
content.
As a result of this distinction, you find that collateral includes pieces that 
you update from time to time, but where the basic messaging is pretty static. 
It needs to be, because it represents your brand and services and provides 
evidence that you’re good at what you do. Content is much more dynamic. 
You’re constantly creating new pieces to fuel your marketing campaigns. 
Some pieces will be usable again and again, whereas others are one-time 
efforts.
Start with your collateral and give it a really good look over, beginning with 
your website. I provide a few ideas in the sidebar ‘How bad is your website?’. 
Work on collateral first, so that your sales effort isn’t hobbled by poor collat-
eral. Then move onto your content development to support your marketing.

 Chapter 10: Creating Your Marketing Plan
How bad is your website?
Prospective clients first experience your firm 
in a number of ways: for example, through a 
personal meeting at an event or through a well-
crafted email. If they have any interest in you, 
they’re on your website in a hop, skip and a 
jump. Unfortunately, many services websites 
are truly dreadful: they look aged and unpro-
fessional, no one is keeping them fresh and 
interesting, and they’re probably at least five 
years old.
This situation shows up as follows:
	✓	The home page doesn’t make clear immedi-
ately what the firm does.
	✓	The focus of the website is for the firm to 
talk at website visitors about what it does, 
instead of talking to visitors about the sorts 
of needs they may have that the firm can 
help with (and how).
	✓	The content is typically written in expert 
language (not everyday English), so is not 
accessible to the target audience.
	✓	The site has way too much text (hint: no one 
reads anything anymore – they don’t have 
the time!).
	✓	The home page has typos, creating an 
instant impression of carelessness.
	✓	The content is generic – it doesn’t seek to 
address the specific audiences.
	✓	The content is static and rarely updated.
	✓	The tone and style of the written mate-
rial changes across the website (different 
people wrote it and it lacks a consistent 
‘voice’).
	✓	The website doesn’t have areas for dynamic 
content (okay, sometimes it has a news 
area, but the last entry is two years old).
	✓	The navigation is poorly constructed so 
the user can get lost and not know how to 
get back.
	✓	The site doesn’t display well on tablets or 
smartphones.
	✓	The site has no ‘calls to action’, things that 
the visitor can click on to drill deeper into 
valuable content or to make contact with you.
To evaluate a website well, you really have to 
be in the shoes of the website visitor. Imagine 
that you’ve no idea who your firm is and take a 
look at your site through those eyes.
Start by listing who you think visits your website 
and what their goals are – these are your target 
audiences. For example, you have prospective 
customers, actual customers, partners and 
potential employees visiting your site. What are 
they trying to accomplish and how easy is it for 
them to do that?
Take a look at your competitors’ websites too, 
especially firms you admire and want to emu-
late. Apply the same process – are they doing 
better than you?
Use the list above to rate how you’re doing in 
each of the areas for each audience. Don’t think 
that you have to have a hugely sophisticated 
website – you just have to be clear, engaging, 
talking to the audience in ways they understand 
and so can get at what they want.
Modern marketing techniques are going to 
drive your audience to your website, wherever 
they came from in the first place. Make sure 
that that your website is ready for them.
If you have any experts on websites among 
your friends and family network, share your 
findings with them and ask them to give you 
objective feedback.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
Making the Most of Your Resources
In the final analysis, of course, reality has to set in (darn it): the amount of 
marketing you can do is dependent on your resources – the staff and their 
skill sets, the help you can get from outside and your budgets.
Breaking the plan down to 
decide on resources
Some of the issues you face are questions such as: What resourcing needs 
(such as people, systems, outsourcing, budgets) have to be considered? How 
do I provide those resources? Who should take care of what?
	
A lot of marketing falls down because the plan for resourcing ends up with one 
person, say the marketing manager, taking on all the marketing work. Meanwhile, 
everyone else ceases to pay attention, unless the results are sub-par – and boy 
do they then notice!
	
Marketing is an investment, so don’t just hand it off, or let it decline into tacti-
cal work. To grow your business, you need the following:
	
✓	Marketing strategies and tactics for how you’re going to support the 
growth goals: Precisely what this chapter is all about!
	
✓	Specific results that you want marketing to drive: Typically a number 
of leads (for which marketing can be directly responsible) and opportu-
nities and wins (the responsibility of sales).
	
✓	A way to check that marketing effort is paying off: You have to be able 
to measure against the pre-defined metric of number of leads. If your 
team members are fairly experienced, they may have an idea of what’s 
typical for your space.
	
✓	Flexibility to change tactics if things appear not to be working: Run 
pilots, for example with a smaller subset of the market, to see how the 
campaign goes. You can also try split tactics (doing a campaign two dif-
ferent ways to see what works best – see Chapter 11).
Even if you’re not the one doing the grunt work, don’t move on to your next 
priority, thinking that you’re done. Management, sales leadership and account 
managers also need to contribute to marketing, not just the marketing staff. 
You also need to give them the resources (tools and budget) they need to get 
the job done.

 Chapter 10: Creating Your Marketing Plan
Satisfying marketing’s appetite: 
Who does the marketing?
Marketing is a needy discipline – as it should be – reliant on input from the 
market, the company, the competition, external partners (such as channel 
partners or subcontractors) and customers.
For a small company, Table 10-4 shows what a typical marketing team looks 
like and the support the members need from the rest of the company. I break 
the roles down to help you plan for future growth, but realistically you may 
have just one person (maybe even part-time).
Table 10-4	
Marketing and Support Teams
Marketing Role
Support Needed
Marketing manager: Responsible for 
marketing plan, campaign design, 
tools, reporting and results.
Management input on plan, approval 
of campaigns and oversight on results. 
Sales collaboration on campaign 
design.
Marketing co-ordinator: Responsible 
for content creation, graphic design, 
campaign execution, database 
management.
Mostly help with content – getting raw 
information from management about 
the firm’s services, customer case 
studies from account/project manag-
ers, collateral or other marketing sup-
port from partners.
Lead developer: Responsible for nur-
turing contacts until they’re qualified 
(Marketing Qualified Leads – MQLs) 
and ready to be handed to sales.
Agreement from sales as to what con-
stitutes a qualified lead.
In Chapter 11, I provide more detail on who does what in marketing.
	
As well as hiring marketing staff, you can also consider contractors or even 
marketing firms. Just be ready for the cost! If you hire a marketing person or a 
firm, they come in asking where their budget is.
You may well need to make the investment when:
	
✓	Sales can no longer keep up with your growth goals.
	
✓	You need to expand your geography or range of services and the current 
team doesn’t have the capacity to deal with that.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
	
✓	You’re poised to grow from a company that hardly anyone has heard of 
to one where people call you.
	
✓	Certain revenue goals are met and the investment is feasible.
	
Each type of services firm is different, so take a look at your competition – 
companies of different sizes – and find out who’s investing in marketing. Look 
at the quality of their websites and brochures; have someone sign up for their 
newsletters (using a personal email address) and check their job postings.
How much budget do you need? For a small services firm, think somewhere 
around 5 per cent of gross revenue: 60–70 per cent of this budget needs to go 
on payroll or professional fees, 30–40 per cent on marketing costs. Truthfully, 
it matters less what you budget than the fact that you have a budget. A budget 
tells the organization that marketing is important, worthy of investment. If 
you don’t set a budget, you’re not really serious about marketing.
Making marketing accountable
Clearly, marketing needs to measure its generation of leads. To do so, you 
need to track the number of MQLs passing from marketing to sales. Some 
email automation systems (see Chapter 11) can report metrics automatically, 
but if not you have to track your results manually.
To design the reporting, sit down with marketing and sales and work out 
what the process is for capturing the numbers – of MQLs, and then of Sales 
Qualified Leads (SQLs) that convert to opportunities and then to sales. You 
need to know which closed deals were sourced by marketing, as opposed to 
a salesperson attending a local event, for example. I discuss MQLs and SQLs 
more in Chapter 9.
Marketing may well do a lot of good work to influence other sources, such as 
leads coming from partners. Make sure that it gets recognition for its work: 
creating collateral from partner resources, running campaigns funded or sup-
ported by partners and the like. The leads may go direct to sales, but market-
ing helped.
	
Make marketing accountable for the budget spend. Ask for a projected budget 
spend based on the marketing calendar (check out the earlier section ‘Creating 
your marketing calendar’ for details). Set authorization limits on what it can 
spend without approval. Keep an eye on that budget!

our business needs a flow of new customers on a regular basis, other-
wise, bang goes your revenue goal. All marketing is an effort to increase 
attention from prospective customers looking for services such as yours. 
As a result, the department can be tempted to busy itself adding value to 
existing opportunities and customers and neglect generating brand new 
prospects.
The purpose of demand generation, by contrast, is to reach out to firms that 
aren’t yet active buyers but are in an early stage of identifying that they have 
a need and have to do something about it. That’s a tall order. Getting the 
attention of people you know is one thing, but reaching out to thousands of 
strangers to stimulate interest is quite another.
In this chapter, I focus on automated demand generation as a subcategory of 
marketing activity. I look at some automated demand generation techniques, 
helping you to plan for the use of demand generation tools and technologies 
and to create and deploy effective programs. In the process, I give you the 
chance to evaluate whether the time is right for you to be looking at market-
ing automation.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
Introducing the Automated Demand 
Generation Game
If you’re a car manufacturer, you don’t wait for buyers to show up at the 
dealership and hope that they buy your latest model. If you’ve ever had one 
of those postcards with a promotional offer: ‘No money down, first month’s 
lease payment waived’, you probably noticed that it arrives about three 
months before your current lease is about to expire. Better still, if you use 
the promotion code to visit the website and look at some models, the phone 
rings from the dealership. Co-incidence? Absolutely not. These highly sophis-
ticated marketing programs trigger when the time is right – for you! The good 
news is that, these days, you can do this sort of automated marketing too.
Waiting for the phone to ring with a hot prospect ready to talk to you right 
now is a singularly unproductive activity. Instead, you want to generate 
demand. When your phone rings without you exerting any manual effort to 
make that happen, you know that you’ve nailed demand generation and that 
your brand is getting recognition in the marketplace as a result of your auto-
mated marketing efforts.
How do you get to this desired state? Technology to the rescue! Automated 
tools are within the reach of marketers today that allow sophisticated 
approaches to nurturing relationships with your contacts.
	
Marketing automation refers to the tools, processes and programs that remove 
the drudgery from marketing’s day-to-day job of generating interest. Marketing 
automation directs your contacts to your valuable content in order to begin 
and then nurture a relationship with your company, while tracking how those 
contacts behave during the buying cycle and providing analysis of what’s  
producing the desired results.
Marketing automation takes you from the world of mass marketing (pushing 
out mass communications to a large audience all at once) to 1-to-1 marketing 
(see Chapter 10 for details); the latter triggers the next step in the campaign 
after a contact takes a certain action, such as clicking through to your web-
site and viewing or downloading some content. Enough of the right actions 
by the contact tells you that a lead is probably ready to talk to sales.
	
Leads that are qualified by marketing – marketing-qualified leads (MQLs), see 
Chapter 9 for more – and that sales welcomes, have some basic characteristics:
	
✓	They fit the profile of the kind of company you want to work with 
(Chapter 5 has more on finding your customer).
	
✓	They have an identified need that fits what you offer (in other words, 
you can solve a firm’s problem/fulfill its need).

 Chapter 11: Automating Marketing – More Leads with Less Effort
	
✓	They have budget, a timeline for purchase and the right people ready to 
get involved in a sales process.
However, continually asking contacts ‘Are we there yet?’ is hard. Why would 
they want to talk to you anyway: they don’t know you, they just know you 
want to sell them something. Instead, if you can offer value to their delibera-
tions, wherever they are in the buyer’s journey (the first half of the customer 
experience in Figure 2-1), they may engage with that content. Marketing auto-
mation is the secret sauce that pushes out content and monitors responses, 
waiting for the evidence that the contact just became a MQL.
If you’re wondering what a buyer’s journey looks like, I expand the customer 
experience into a detailed buyer’s journey in the section on ‘Designing 
demand generation programs’ later in this chapter.
Understanding the buyer’s journey
	
Buyers are a lot less interested in talking to salespeople than they used to be. 
These days they look online, to the social networks and search engines, to get 
content delivered through a wide range of channels, to inform themselves fully 
before they take the dreaded step of picking up the phone to call your com-
pany (or your competitors).
When prospective customers are talking to sales, they’re in the later stages 
of the buyer’s journey – and that’s your opportunity to influence the outcome 
through your detailed attention to the sales process (see more in Chapter 14). 
But what are they doing during the 60–75 percent of the buyer’s journey when 
they’re not talking to you?
	
Right now, your evidence of that probably comes from existing customers and 
recent wins or losses (if you bother to ask them the right questions). This data 
set is necessarily small, so it can be misleading.
Automated demand generation gives you insight into what buyers of your 
type of service actually do during the early stages of the buyer’s journey, but 
with much larger volumes of data than you can possibly get from personal 
interviews, or even from online research. When you build an automated pro-
gram, you start to gather behavioral data that’s useful at three levels:
	
✓	It tells you what to do next for that contact (and I’m talking about an 
individual person within a target company here).
	
✓	It can provide you with analytics (reports that tell you about overall per-
formance and trends) on what your target customers respond to most 
favorably, what drives them from looking at your communications to 
picking up the phone and calling (or any other action that indicates to 
you that they’re getting close to qualification as a lead).

✓	You can start ranking behavior that’s most indicative of a target customer 
converting to a sales lead and then into a customer.
	
✓	You can assess which campaign elements (specific emails, ads, webinars) 
are working well and which are less effective.
Providing insights for your 
prospective customers
In the early stages of the buyer’s journey, potential prospects aren’t inter-
ested in your company, your brochures or what services you have to offer. 
They’re looking for insight into market trends, what solutions others are 
using to solve the same need that they have and what the advantages and 
pitfalls are of solving the problem at all.
	
If prospects are in the early stages of their process, anything that looks like 
‘trying to sell them something’ is really annoying. They may be researching so 
as to make a case for implementing a solution to the ‘real’ buyer – that is, the 
one who’s going to sign the contract. They may be trying to work out whether 
doing nothing is still better than doing something. You don’t know what 
they’re thinking, but wouldn’t finding out be great?
At each stage of the buyer’s journey, the types of insight you can provide 
change. That’s why understanding the buyer’s journey and how they respond 
to your content is so important.
Attracting an audience
Even if you have great content, you still have to get it out in front of your 
target audience. Who that is varies according to which service you’re trying 
to position and to whom within the target company you’re sending the mes-
sage. This situation isn’t ‘one size fits all’.
You already have some contacts who consume content – your customers, 
prospects in the pipeline, partners, and your friends and family. Not only do 
they probably look at your content, they may be willing to share your content 
with their network if you make doing so easy for them.
If you want growth, you can’t just speak to people you know. You have to 
expand your reach. Ultimately, you need the majority of your audience to 
be people in the target companies you’re trying to convert into customers. 
To get at the really valuable contacts, you need to put content where your

203
 Chapter 11: Automating Marketing – More Leads with Less Effort
targets flock together – such as within specific LinkedIn groups, conferences 
or highly authoritative websites to which a significant number of your buyers 
subscribe. You can also research or purchase lists that fit your criteria. 
Obtaining, growing and maintaining your database of contacts is an impor-
tant aspect of demand generation. I go into more detail on building your data-
base in the later, appropriately named ‘Building your database’ section.
	
The reality is that the more you try to have people opt in to your  
communications – that is, follow or sign up for your emails or other content –  
the more likely you are to have random people reading your content even 
though they’re not a prospect at all (or at least they lack the authority to 
purchase much more than a box of teabags). As you get sophisticated with 
demand generation, you become able to rank your incoming leads based on 
the specific campaigns they respond to or actions they take. See Table 9-4 for 
more information.
Asking whether Demand Generation 
Is Right for You
Young services companies don’t usually jump right into the complexities of 
automated demand generation. More commonly, a time comes when the sales 
force is running at a hundred miles an hour and marketing just can’t keep up 
with the volume of manual work it has to do to create and manage the mar-
keting programs.
Without doubt, that’s the tipping point when you realize that you need to find 
a better way of working. Read on to see whether automated demand genera-
tion is that better approach.
Deciding when to consider automated 
demand generation
When your marketing team is tapped out, it starts to become a bottleneck 
to growth. At this time you need to take a good hard look at automation, 
because it gives you the opportunity to expand your efforts without a big 
investment in more resources – in other words, you can do a lot more with a 
modest expansion in staffing and expenditure on technology systems.
Automated demand generation is a relatively new discipline, less than five 
years old, so if you’re not doing it yet that’s no surprise. However, market pres-
sure is building fast to jump on the bandwagon – Oracle, owner of the market-
ing automation tool Eloqua, predicts that 50 per cent of business-to-business 
www.ebook777.com

204
Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
companies will be using demand generation tools and practices by 2015. (Take 
that prediction with a pinch of salt, though – the early adopters were compa-
nies with the resources to invest big time in building complex programs target-
ing millions of contacts; smaller firms like yours may take a little more time.) 
The good news is that the tools are getting more affordable and easier to use; 
the bad news is that experts in demand generation are currently commanding 
high prices in the job market.
	
I say earlier that the investment in demand generation can be relatively modest. 
For a small firm, say under $5 million (£3.15 million), it may seem like quite a big 
investment – you face an upfront cost in acquiring tools, designing programs 
and growing your database. But once you get started, the automated nature of 
the programs requires less manual intervention and allows you to expand the 
volume and reach of your communications. As soon as you can afford it, do it. 
Demand generation is the most cost effective way to expand your reach and get 
from $5 million to $10 million and beyond.
So, do you need demand generation? In Table 11-1, you can see some factors 
to consider.
Table 11-1	
Do You Need Automated Demand Generation?
Factor to Consider
Should You Go for It?
You start to see a plateau in your 
growth caused by a stream of leads 
that just balances your customer attri-
tion (that is, new customers are just 
about replacing customers that have 
completed).
Yes. You’ve been in growth mode and 
things were looking promising, but now 
revenue growth is slowing. Make sure 
that the market you’re addressing  
has the potential for your revenue 
ambitions – otherwise you may have 
to expand your operations to new mar-
kets. However, it looks like a good time 
to make the investment.
Your database of contacts has grown 
to several thousand and you’ve every 
intention of building it further. Typically, 
you’ve been doing email marketing 
by creating lists, which are getting 
fragmented and are a headache to 
manage.
Yes. As your database grows, you get 
more sophisticated about expanding 
to different roles (personas), industries 
and geographies. You already have 
good content, but to direct communi-
cations that are even more targeted, 
you need to be able to select the right 
contacts from your database (called 
segmentation). Therefore, you require 
tools that can manage a unified data-
base of contacts and allow queries 
to be created that select from that 
database for a specific campaign. The 
reporting also needs to be automated.

 Chapter 11: Automating Marketing – More Leads with Less Effort
Factor to Consider
Should You Go for It?
How big are you? How many custom-
ers a year do you need to acquire? 
How competitive is your space? 
Companies at around $5 million (£3.15 
million) in revenue, needing to add sev-
eral new customers a month, where 
competition on any given deal can be 
from four or five other companies, tend 
to start eyeing demand generation.
Maybe. If your growth goals are ambi-
tious and the market is fairly com-
petitive, companies use automated 
demand generation to gain advantage: 
the discipline is relatively new, so you 
can be an early adopter in your space. 
Review Chapter 10 and design some 
basic marketing programs before you 
make a decision.
Your content attracts unexpected 
(good) attention.
Maybe. You’ve pushed content out 
there, your speaking engagements 
have become increasingly popular and 
people are signing up for your newslet-
ter in droves. Things are getting too 
much to handle. You’re clearly onto 
something, and so automating is going 
to expand on your results without a big 
increase in staff.
Gathering the required resources
Here are the resources you’re likely to need to implement automated demand 
generation:
	
✓	Consulting advice to help you map your personas and your buyer’s jour-
ney, evaluate your current content and assess your readiness to start 
marketing automation.
	
✓	One additional hire in marketing, or cutting back on other programs and 
retraining staff on the new approach. You benefit from upgrading your 
existing staff – they come with the significant advantage of knowing your 
company really well. Everyone in the marketing space is starting to learn 
demand generation, so they deserve the chance to discover these new 
techniques too.
	
✓	A solid customer relationship management tool (such as Salesforce), a 
flexible website that can support campaigns with landing pages (special 
web pages that act as a gate to the content) and a marketing automation 
(MA) tool. I discuss websites briefly in Chapter 10 and talk more about 
tools later on in this chapter (see ‘Choosing your infrastructure tools’).
So what investment may you need to get started? I base the following num-
bers on an assumption that your current campaign planning has some ele-
ments you can repurpose for an automated demand generation pilot. In other

206
Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
words, when your systems are set up and talking to each other, you can get a 
pilot program going in two to three months.
Roughly, here’s where your money goes:
Demand generation consultant for two months
$10,000
One additional marketing person – annual cost
$40,000–80,000
MA tool (software service) – annual cost
$10,000
Data purchases per year
$10,000
Content creation per year
$20,000
TOTAL PER YEAR
$90,000–$130,000
	
You can probably absorb some of these costs internally, but as you can see, 
this investment is one better suited to companies with around $5 million 
(£3.15 million) in revenue or more.
If you’re thinking that you can use less expensive ways to do marketing (such 
as using social marketing tactics, press releases, pushing your content to 
multiple places (content syndication), hosting network events, offering free 
workshops, cross-promotion with other businesses, supporting community 
events, focused SEO across all content and website, using less expensive 
email marketing tools and using interns), bear in mind that all these activi-
ties require expenditure and take human effort, which people often pretend 
is ‘free’. It’s not. Some of these approaches can be low cost, and some may be 
just perfect for you – build a marketing program that works for you and con-
sider automation when you’re ready.
	
Be realistic. Don’t expect instant results and don’t think that marketing can 
drive more than 20–25 percent of total leads in years 1 or 2. The best market-
ing organizations get to 30 percent or so in the services field. Even so, that’s 
quite a contribution, bearing in mind the cost of a good salesperson.
Adding Automation to Your 
Marketing Armory
The value of marketing automation is the automation (duh!) and the ability to 
pick out contacts that are targeted prospects likely to be ready to talk to you. 
When you combine an already effective marketing program with marketing 
automation, you can expand your reach, your frequency of campaigns and 
your ability to laser target specific groups within your target market. Your 
existing marketing strategy, programs and campaigns, designed to support 
your business goals (see Chapters 9 and 10), are the cornerstone of your

 Chapter 11: Automating Marketing – More Leads with Less Effort
future marketing automation. Don’t throw all that out – you’re not starting 
again, you’re enhancing your capabilities with some new tools, techniques 
and ways of designing your programs and campaigns.
Before you can get there, you need to go through some considerations.
	
In order to adopt marketing automation in your company, you need to con-
sider the following three things:
	
✓	Infrastructure and staffing for marketing automation: In everyday 
English, tools and people (internal and external).
	
✓	Demand generation programs that use automation techniques: In 
other words, the contacts, campaign design and content ready for the 
first wave of the campaign to launch.
	
✓	Procedures and best practices for running and reporting on auto-
mated programs: What your reporting can tell you and what to do if the 
pilot doesn’t seem to be getting traction.
In this section I describe who in your company is needed at every stage as 
you look at tools, build your database, design your automated programs and 
test and evaluate your campaigns. I provide sections on each of those stages.
You’re going to need different people as you work through the stages: maybe 
an external marketing automation consultant or firm, an additional marketing 
team member, a specialist who writes content and creates graphics, or a vid-
eographer who captures your content in compelling high definition. Consider 
getting creative with your staffing: for example, full-time, part-time, contract, 
interns. Get help as and when you need it to manage your investment.
Choosing your infrastructure tools
Regarding infrastructure, marketing automation depends on three intercon-
nected systems, as Figure 11-1 shows.
As you can see, connections exist between all the systems: data passing to 
and fro, or users of specific parts of the system taking advantage of the capa-
bilities of other components.
	
The key thing to take away is that these three systems communicate with 
each other to progress your relationship with contacts that choose to act on 
your invitations. Their actions tell you where they are in the sales process, 
so that you waste less time on pointless cold calls to people who have no 
interest in your service right now – allowing you to focus on contacts that 
show signs of life.

 Chapter 11: Automating Marketing – More Leads with Less Effort
	
As with most other aspects of business development, you have to make 
choices about how these three systems interact. Some companies manage 
their landing pages with their MA tool, leaving the website as the place 
where content is accessed or downloaded. Some treat their sales force auto-
mation/customer relationship management (SFA/CRM) tool as the master 
contact database; others use the MA tool for this task. All three systems also 
offer reporting and analytics. Setting all this up takes some depth of knowl-
edge, so if you’re not particularly technical, get help! I discuss SFA/CRM tools 
in more detail in Chapter 13. Note that most firms where sales is a complex 
process use an SFA/CRM tool and then add an MA tool when they’re ready. 
If your sales process is really simple, you may be managing sales with a 
spreadsheet and you’re more likely to use a simple email marketing tool, not 
a full-blown MA tool.
The choice of tools and how they get set up is an important decision that 
you need to take collaboratively. Get your marketing and sales leaders, head 
of account management and head of customer service, if you have one, all 
involved. Ideally, you want to pick systems that are easy to integrate (get to 
talk to each other) and require the minimum of customization. Using the solu-
tions ‘out-of-the-box’ is ideal.
Marketing automation infrastructure in action
Imagine that your company just created a new 
white paper and an email has just gone out from 
the marketing automation tool to 3,000 contacts 
with a link. When recipients click on the link, 
they’re taken to a landing page. This page may 
have some content that positions the white 
paper, or even asks for additional information 
from the contacts, before they can download 
the white paper.
Between the marketing automation system, 
which can capture email click-throughs, and 
the website, which can track user actions on the  
website and gather more information about 
the contact, your knowledge about the contact 
increases based on data and behavior. This 
information can be pushed through to the sales 
automation system, so that a salesperson who 
chooses to contact that person knows who she is, 
what she’s been doing on your website and what 
type of content she’s already been looking at.
Now imagine that the same contact fills in a 
form on the website to download a piece of 
content called ‘10 things to ask your new _____ 
services firm’. This action is recorded in the 
marketing automation system, which deter-
mines that this contact has ‘scored’ enough 
points to be classified as an MQL. This lead 
gets posted immediately into the sales force 
automation system and sends a message to a 
salesperson. She calls, finds out that the lead 
is a real opportunity and then disables any fur-
ther emails going from the MA tool, because 
she’s now going to manage the communica-
tions in person. The salesperson can direct the 
prospect to specific content on the website, or 
use emails that have been created as part of 
campaigns in the MA system, to edit and send 
individually to the prospect.
If your head is spinning right now, welcome to 
the world of marketing automation.

Your head of marketing needs to drive the choice of MA tool. Make sure that 
it can:
	
✓	Handle a database of contacts and allow you to determine what data you 
want to store.
	
✓	Provide a way of querying the database so you can select contacts for a 
specific campaign.
	
✓	Create and store email templates and allow you to create specific email 
from those templates.
	
✓	Create automated campaigns, including the different stages of the cam-
paign and the rules that determine when the next stage of the campaign 
should be implemented (typically for an individual).
	
✓	Track behavior by allowing you to assign points to each action that the 
contact takes. The sum of the points tells you when the threshold for 
designating the contact as a MQL has been reached. Time to call them!
	
✓	Integrate with your SFA/CRM so that contact data and new leads can 
flow between the two systems. Ideally, your MA tool also integrates with 
your website, especially if you require site visitors to log in before you 
provide them with valuable content.
	
✓	Provide detailed reports on specific campaigns, as well as summary 
reports, dashboards and the like, on campaigns overall.
	
For your website, you typically need a content management system (CMS) if 
you’re going to keep adding fresh content to your website. The next time you 
go in for a website redesign, make sure that you implement a CMS, even a free 
one like WordPress. It may cost marginally more at the time, but you don’t 
have to pay a web designer ongoing fees to add new content for you – your 
folks can do that themselves.
Prepare yourself for at least three months of setting up. It may go quicker, but 
you’re one of the lucky ones if it does.
If this all seems like overkill, consider lower-cost options, such as a simple 
online email marketing tool, SFA and CMS tools. They won’t be integrated 
(passing data to and fro to each other), but if your volume of activity is fairly 
low, they’re a good choice, until you’re ready for the big time.
Building your database
Small firms often pull together contact lists and shoot out emails using 
simple tools (which are well designed and easy to use). Then they go through 
the same process again the next time they want to send out a mass email.

211
 Chapter 11: Automating Marketing – More Leads with Less Effort
The problem with lists is that they go out-of-date quickly and multiple lists 
may have the same people in them – so that telling who’s received what is dif-
ficult. As your volume of contacts grows, managing your communications and 
keeping your data up-to-date becomes increasingly difficult.
Initially, your contacts are probably existing relationships and you add 
to them from business cards you collect, from people who call in to the 
office, or fill in a form on your website, or from research you do on LinkedIn 
or other tools such as Hoovers, Dun & Bradstreet, InsideView, Data.com, 
Netpropex or the like. The list of sources is endless and it takes a lot of effort 
to collect and capture all this contact data. You can even buy lists from a list 
broker.
When you move to marketing automation, you need a database of contacts 
that you’re going to reach out to with your marketing efforts. You may have 
the beginnings of such a database in your SFA tool, but it’s typically rather 
stagnant, because sales can do only so much to keep in touch with hundreds 
or thousands of contacts. The database (think contact record) usually stores 
firmographics, namely data such as the company size, number of employees, 
industry, contact name, title, department, email, phone number and website.
	
Marketing automation (MA) becomes really powerful when it starts to add 
behavioral data to the contact record. Where firmographics allow you to seg-
ment the database by geography, company size, industry, job role or any other 
criterion for which you have the data, behavioral data allows you to under-
stand the contact’s position in the buyer’s journey. You can allocate points to 
specific behavior and then select an aggregated score that’s the threshold for 
defining a MQL.
Your MA tool can also help you identify which contacts are out-of-date 
from emails that bounce back as undelivered. This identification gives 
you the opportunity to eliminate inaccurate contacts or to find out where 
they’ve gone.
	
You can grow your database from list purchases, research, sign-ups, personal 
contacts – just remember that you can’t blast out unsolicited emails. When 
you use MA, you start to build a reputation as a sender of email – you get your 
own score for how trustworthy you are. If you misbehave, you can get shut 
down as an email sender. So make sure that you understand the CAN-SPAM 
Act or other legislation that applies in your country, or hire a firm to manage 
your emails and reputation for you. Also consider emailing your existing 
contacts and asking for them to share your email with their network. Include 
something that may excite or interest the new contacts. This approach helps 
you get additional ‘opted-in’ contacts (people who have agreed to accept your 
communications).

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
	
Email marketing is a complex legal area – get help and keep within the law.
When you first acquire a list to add to your database, you get excited at the 
possibility of all those new contacts. Be aware that bought lists are up to 
30 per cent inaccurate, and so send your list to a data-cleansing service to 
test the email for deliverability and to send the first email, which gives con-
tacts a chance to subscribe or unsubscribe from your communications. The 
first email should be a ‘teaser’, letting contacts know what your upcoming 
series of communications is going to be all about. If they’re interested, they 
stick with you.
Now you have a clean list based on a data-cleansing company that has 
a solid email reputation (namely, its emails haven’t been blacklisted by 
the major email providers, such as Gmail). Because this type of company 
sends millions of emails a day, your database of, say, 10,000 emails isn’t 
going to impact its overall reputation for having high levels of email deliv-
ery and low levels of complaints. This area is complex, which is why you 
need a marketing automation or email marketing specialist in your network 
of support.
Database management is a time-consuming activity, but not rocket science. 
Your marketing co-ordinator should be able to manage your database as well 
and create content for your marketing programs, with help from others in 
your organization.
Designing demand generation programs
Before you build your first automated campaign, you need to take a stab 
at mapping the buyer’s journey in a bit more detail. Doing so is important 
because the prize is better qualified leads based on scoring that’s driven by 
behavior; therefore, you need to understand that behavior in finer detail, so 
that you can design programs that fit the buyer’s journey. What might that 
look like?
Mapping your buyer’s journey
Figure 11-2 shows a sample early-stage buyer’s journey based on the section 
on creating your marketing campaign in Chapter 10. It concerns an education 
department that’s looking to build an environmentally friendly (LEED certi-
fied) school. I use that example to show how to use the buyer’s journey to 
automate that particular campaign. Your own buyer’s journey will have its 
nuances.

213
 Chapter 11: Automating Marketing – More Leads with Less Effort
This journey is independent of your intervention, and so it gives you an 
objective view that allows you to design a program that aligns with the 
buyer’s desires at each step, providing exactly the right information at the 
right time.
	
Figure 11-2: 
The buyer’s 
journey.
	
	
A company has multiple ‘buyers’; a lot of B2B purchases are made by commit-
tee, so when you design a program for a CFO, for example, map the buyer’s 
journey separately from the one for a CEO or CIO or head of HR. These peo-
ple’s involvement and concerns are different.
Designing your program
Figure 11-3 shows the program that maps to Figure 11-2. This program is just 
one of many options, but the underlying principle is sound: give the contacts 
what they want, when they want it. This campaign is based on the architect 
example in Chapter 10 and is an automated version of the one in Figure 10-3.
From the buyer’s journey, you can probably see that this buyer can respond 
to any one of dozens of possible campaigns elements. You have to be selec-
tive about what you can get done because you can’t do everything that’s 
possible.

 Chapter 11: Automating Marketing – More Leads with Less Effort
Imagine that a contact doesn’t respond to wave 0 or 1, but clicks on a LinkedIn 
post pointing to the content for wave 2. That tells you that the contact is 
somewhere between steps 4 and 6 of the buyer’s journey (Figure 11-2). Then:
	
1.	The MA tool waits 3 days and then emails wave 3 to that contact and 
to others who responded to wave 2 with the same action.
	
2.	If the contact picks up wave 3, the MA tool waits 3 days and then 
emails wave 4.
	
3.	If at any stage, the score exceeds the threshold for an MQL (see the 
key on Figure 11-3), a lead gets posted to the SFA tool for a qualifier/
salesperson to call the contact, checks that she received the materials 
and offers her a chance to talk to someone who can help (in this case, 
a partner in the firm).
	
4.	An appointment is set; the partner’s responsibility is to convert the 
conversation into an opportunity.
Notice that when the program’s elements are all in place, the first wave kicks 
off and the whole program runs itself, with each contact being handled at the 
pace that’s appropriate to it. Bingo – 1-to-1 marketing. Note how personal this 
process feels to the contact – instead of just getting an email every month, 
she now gets the next piece of information when she needs it.
	
Whatever the campaign element, whether blog, email, LinkedIn ad or search 
engine pay-per-click, you want to measure the response rate, so even if it’s 
not an email, you drive clicks to your website, so that you can start to capture 
contact data. When you have contact data (minimum is an email address) you 
can start tracking behavior from your email campaigns.
Campaigns that have extremely low response rates probably don’t generate 
a customer down the line, so response rates tell you something about the 
effectiveness of your campaigns. However, as your automated campaigns 
start to get traction, you can add other measures, such as customer acqui-
sition cost (CAC). To add them, you track MQLs and calculate the cost of 
acquiring the MQL as an absolute dollar value at the end of the campaign. 
For example, if marketing spends $5,000 (£3,150) on a campaign and the 
result is ten MQLs, each one effectively costs $500 (£315) to acquire in  
marketing terms. Marketing’s goal is to drive this number down.
Automated programs take some experience to design. This work belongs in 
the hands of your head of marketing, unless you hire a specialist to do the 
design. Your best writers and designers can put together the details, such as 
the content for ads, emails or white papers, but the marketing leader should 
be on the hook for approving the design of the program and for its success.
	
When MQLs pop up, someone needs to make calls: a salesperson or a lead 
qualifier – someone who can follow up on an MQL and qualify the lead into a 
sales opportunity.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
Although I’m focusing on prospective customer campaigns, don’t neglect 
partners and existing customers. Work out good programs for them. However, 
because the contact numbers are typically small, you can run these cam-
paigns through your MA tool, but they don’t usually need a lot of steps or to 
be automated. Note that you can run a non-automated campaign (such as a 
single email blast, or several email blasts that you initiate manually). In other 
words, MA tools have all the capabilities of a simple email marketing tool and 
a lot more.
	
Email seems simple, but good email campaigns take some finesse. You may 
well appreciate the glossary of email marketing terms at http://blog. 
anchorcomputer.com/index.php/about-us/email-marketing- 
glossary-and-common-terms.
Testing and evaluating your programs
You need to test your new MA tool with a pilot, so develop a program that’s 
relatively simple, even one without any automation, such as a single email 
shot. After you gain confidence that the system is working, you can start 
­getting fancy, as the rest of this section describes.
Headlines that work
How many unsolicited emails do you get a day? How many that you signed up 
for? Do you read them all? Fifty per cent of them? Ten per cent? When you’re 
swamped, an email requires a compelling subject line to grab your attention.
	
Think about your audience, what bothers them in your specialty area and 
what would have them open that email, click through and read all your con-
tent. I have an email today in my inbox that says ‘Hiring Advice: Selecting Your 
Interview Questions Wisely’ (yawn). Here are a few of my own subject lines, 
just for fun:
	
✓	Is your business development a third-grader’s lemonade stand?
	
✓	Why marketing is like your washing machine.
	
✓	You know the score on the football game – so how’s your business 
doing?
	
✓	Sales. Business development. The same thing, right?
If contacts receiving your emails don’t get past the subject line, you’re in the 
‘deleted’ folder in the wink of an eye. You get less than three seconds before 
that delete key is pressed, so make it compelling.

 Chapter 11: Automating Marketing – More Leads with Less Effort
Like everyone, I get a lot of emails from people trying to sell me services. 
Here’s the third in a series of emails from a prospecting company. The sub-
ject line was ‘Should I stay or should I go?’:
Hi Anna,
I’ve tried reaching out several times to go over your lead generation strat-
egies at RainMakers and have not heard back from you. This tells me a 
few things:
1) You’re all set with your current prospecting strategies, if this is the 
case please let me know so I will stop bothering you.
2) You’re interested but have not had the time to respond.
3) You’re being chased by a hippo and need me to call Animal Control!
His other emails were equally imaginative and funny, even if not perfectly 
written! They’re all still in my inbox. When I need prospecting help, I’ll 
call him.
	
Make your subject lines and emails compelling. Come to think of it, make all 
your content compelling – it has to stand out.
A/B split testing
If you’re going to start with a pilot email campaign, you may want to test your 
headlines, body text or other aspects of the email (such as send dates and 
times). Your MA tool should have the function to allow you to test different 
emails automatically. If not, you can do it manually on a pilot group, though 
you may find it a bit laborious.
Here’s how A/B split testing works:
	
1.	Create two versions of the content, for example two different subject 
lines (hence the A/B idea).
	
2.	Split your pilot list into two.
	
3.	Send your two emails and see which gets the better open rate.
	
4.	Use that version for your final email.
	
For step 2, the pilot list doesn’t have to be exactly in half, but do try to make 
it random (for example, split by last name, A–L, M–Z, rather than, say, by 
state, which would introduce regional biases). You can, of course, segment 
your database, say select all CIOs and then do an A/B split test on them by 
last name.

You need enough emails to make the results reliable, so this technique is for 
a larger database. You should also be able to do this type of testing on your 
website, with different headlines, images or other content. Ask your web 
expert if you’re interested in finding out more.
Channels additional to the core campaign
Your campaigns managed inside your MA tool are centered on email, but the 
general idea is to provide great content and then direct contacts to where 
to find it. You can use a lot of other ways to drive people to your content, 
just be aware that you’re no longer in control of who the message gets to, 
whereas your database at least contains a core of good targets.
	
Here are a few examples of other options:
	
✓	LinkedIn (adverts on group pages or sponsored updates).
	
✓	Banner Ads on sites that your contacts are likely to go to (usually under 
a pay-per-click model).
	
✓	Tweets and retweets (if you’ve enough followers, or followers that have 
large numbers of followers).
If you’re not an expert in the three techniques above, get help, because they 
all require some expertise. You don’t want to waste your money getting it 
wrong.
Points per action and threshold scoring
When you design your campaigns, the first waves are typically directed to the 
early stages in the buyer’s journey and later ones kick in if the contact starts 
reacting (check out the earlier Figure 11-3). You normally allocate lower 
points to action in earlier stages, more to later ones. This rule isn’t hard and 
fast, but is a good general one to start with. Your threshold score is also a bit 
of a guess to begin.
Track your leads and see whether they develop into solid opportunities 
that the salespeople can propose on (and this process can take months, of 
course). If you’ve enough data, trace back to the points and scores and see 
whether your setup is a good predictor of real opportunities (ultimately 
closed deals too, but salespeople should be delighted to have a real opportu-
nity from marketing – it’s up to them to win it).
Making the phone ring
The first time someone calls as a result of a campaign you’re running is a 
special day – even if it turns out not to be any kind of lead! Ultimately, you 
want prospective customers to be calling you and that typically happens

 Chapter 11: Automating Marketing – More Leads with Less Effort
only when they’re referred by someone they trust (and these leads are really 
precious), or when your name is ‘out there’ sufficiently that people know 
you by reputation (for example, your partners are talking about how great 
you are, you’ve won awards or your people get invited to present at speaking 
engagements).
To get to that point is a journey. Marketing automation is a great place to 
start, because you need to position yourself in a credible way with large num-
bers of people.
	
One place to start elevating your results is to get your lead qualification caller 
and salespeople to pay close attention to what marketing is doing. Ensure that 
you:
	
✓	Make sure that marketing callers and salespeople knows what cam-
paigns are happening: Your MA or email marketing tool can send ‘seed’ 
emails to a list of internal people. Put your callers and salespeople 
on that list. Also send them your campaign plan before you start the 
campaign.
	
✓	Route leads automatically: The quicker someone calls a lead when 
they pass the score threshold, the better. You hear people talk about 3 
minutes, or within 15 minutes, but those practices are normally B2C or 
product sales, not services. You can set policy dependent on how urgent 
people think your services are. If it’s reputation management, get on it 
right away. If it’s HR services, that day is usually fine. The point is that 
a lot of people signal their interest to a company and never hear back. 
And then companies complain that prospects don’t call them! Your MA 
tool can route leads to your SFA tool, if they’re integrated.
	
✓	Enable sales with new, fresh content: Make your campaigns and con-
tent available to sales so that it can use them to send to its own con-
tacts. If your MA and SFA tools are integrated, this process may even be 
automatic. For example, I can send emails from Salesforce (my SFA tool) 
that were originally created as mass campaigns in Silverpop (my MA 
tool).
	
✓	Share campaign results: Your tool can create reports to show how cam-
paigns are doing. Get feedback from sales on leads that you passed to 
them too and review the campaign metrics with the team at the end to 
see what’s working and what isn’t.
	
✓	Consider content quality: If you’re getting a poor response to your 
campaigns, but you think that your database is a good one, the problem 
may be down to poor content. Get feedback internally and ask a couple 
of trusted advisors what they think about your content. An awful lot of 
good content is out there – maybe yours just doesn’t stand out enough.
May the force of marketing automation take you to the phone ringing off 
the hook.

Forming a Winning Team: 
Marketing and Sales  
Cohesion
In This Chapter
▶	Aligning sales and marketing to increase revenue
▶	Helping marketing and sales get along
A
 
 growing services business has to expand its strategies for reaching 
more and more prospective customers as well as retaining and growing 
existing ones. Doing the same old thing year after year just doesn’t hack it.
When acquiring new customers, the burden of effort falls on marketing and 
sales, but unfortunately these functions often don’t see eye to eye. In the 
most extreme cases, they’re severely at odds, with finger-pointing if the 
results are lower than management wants. Yet one of the keys to successful 
business development is having marketing and sales operating in concert. 
Research from the Aberdeen Group (in 2010) reveals that companies grow 
faster when marketing and sales co-operate effectively.
This chapter explains why collaboration is necessary and explores how to 
achieve that aim and produce maximum results. I look at where the divide 
between sales and marketing arises and suggest ways to make sure that the 
two parties play nicely in the sandbox, avoid problems (watch out for any 
submerged cat-mess mines!) and build one whopping big sandcastle.

Although they’re separate disciplines, marketing and sales are trying to talk 
to the same audience: your target customers. Plus, both ultimately want to 
secure the same goal: the growth of your business. When internal stresses 
build up between marketing and sales (and also delivery), the customer’s 
experience around the lifecycle ceases to be seamless. Check out Figure 12-1, 
which is a simplified version of Figure 2-1, with marketing, sales and delivery 
providing care and feeding the customer from appetizer through to dessert.
	
Figure 12-1: 
Overlapping 
roles for 
market-
ing and 
sales in the 
customer 
lifecycle.
	
	
The figure shows the significant overlaps between the three disciplines. 
Services is a team game and when your people work in compartmentalized 
groups, all sorts of issues occur.
In this section I discuss the importance of sales and marketing alignment as 
your business develops, identifying clear responsibilities and roles, as well as 
shared goals.
Reassessing roles as your business grows
When your business started up, perhaps one person, or maybe two or three 
people, did everything. The advantage in those early days is that everyone 
knows everything what’s happening all the time.

 Chapter 12: Forming a Winning Team: Marketing and Sales Cohesion
Confusion doesn’t arise all that much about who does what in small organi-
zations, because people undertake several functions and everyone knows 
everyone. Perhaps one owner takes on marketing and sales and another 
heads up delivery, and that’s about it. You may still encounter the occasional 
issue, of course:
	
✓	If you love selling, you may get impatient with the complaints from deliv-
ery about how you overpromised and now it can’t deliver.
	
✓	If you’re an operations leader, you may think that sales is sloppy and 
should do a better job defining the scope and getting more money for 
the work.
Even so, organizations with, say, less than ten people rarely hear someone 
remark ‘I thought you were going to do that!’ The problem is that in small 
organizations the original people aren’t going to be good at every aspect. 
They can’t be: people aren’t wired to excel at everything.
	
As your business grows, job roles inevitably need to become more specialized. 
Adding new people to the organization can cause fractures in the previously 
smooth, if imperfect, management of the customer lifecycle. That’s the point 
when you need to work hard at getting alignment between your department 
leaders (like marketing, sales and delivery) and with the customer experience 
cycle.
Laying out the connections between 
marketing and sales
Although sales, marketing and delivery have different skills and focuses, 
they’re pulling towards the same end. Inevitably, therefore, their roles are 
linked and indeed interdependent – as I show in Figure 12-2.
	
Delivery always is, or should be, really busy, so marketing and sales need to 
reach out to delivery for what they need – such as feedback and case studies 
from customers or support for the sales process to help scope, price and sell 
a deal. (I include delivery in this section, because delivery is critical to new 
sales and to feedback to marketing and sales. The discipline gets more atten-
tion in Part V.)
Say that you have three leaders heading up marketing, sales and delivery. In 
an ideal world, who takes care of what around the customer experience is 
clear. Table 12-1 is a more detailed version of Figure 12-1, as a working model. 
Organizations vary in whether and where sales and marketing are involved 
around the cycle, and so adapt this table to your own situation and needs.

Note that the items in italics are the support that one function provides to

departments are collaborating (the text in bold) – these are prime opportuni-
ties for misunderstandings as to who’s doing what and who’s responsible for 
the outcomes.
Organizations that take a customer-centric viewpoint and even start to break 
down traditional departmental barriers tend to do much better in acquiring, 
retaining and growing customers.
	
Discuss Table 12-1 as a team and thrash out any issues or friction. (Check out 
Chapter 13, where I supply loads of suggestions for structuring this discus-
sion.) The key is do it fast, within a month, and revisit frequently.
Setting common goals and targets
Being clear about marketing and sales’ responsibilities is essential (see the 
preceding section), but actions have no bite unless you tie them to specific 
goals. When you create strategic goals for the organization, you need to break 
them down into specific targets for marketing and sales. Chapter 6 shows you 
how to choose those strategic initiatives and make them quantifiable.

Imagine that one of your goals is to drive $4 million (£2.52 million) in net new 
sales in the next year. Typically you obtain your leads from referrals, from cus-
tomers or from your network, plus your partners have been good at sending 
you great leads too. Over the last 12 months, you closed $3 million (£1.89 mil-
lion) in net new business, and so you’re looking for $1 million (£630,000 more). 
You started investing in marketing three months ago and the department is 
ready to start programs to drive leads. You want your pipeline for the next 
year to look like Figure 12-3.
	
Figure 12-3: 
Expanding 
the pipeline: 
shaded area 
indicates 
when a 
handover 
occurs.
	
Not only does marketing need to drive leads, it must also support sales 
with materials, organize and drive campaign activities that engage partners, 
customers and other relationships, and simultaneously maintain ongoing 
marketing of your brand and company. Marketing is a direct and indirect 
contributor to lead generation, and because expanding channels and adding 
new ones is the strategy for growth of net new sales, marketing has to play 
a major part.
	
Sales needs to understand that marketing-produced leads are neither better 
nor worse than ones from other channels. Here are a couple of examples of 
leads that don’t originate from marketing:
	
✓	Leads from partners: These may or may not progress to be prospects. 
Although the leads usually want what you have to offer, they often don’t 
have enough budget or they already have a preferred vendor (not you) 
or they’re looking at next year anyway.
	
✓	Referrals from your network: These leads can be rather varied in quality –  
your contacts are so eager to help that they refer anyone they can, with no 
reference as to whether they’re a fit or even need the precise service you 
have to offer.
In both of these cases, sales spends time qualifying, some of which is ‘wasted’. 
Sales may moan about this, but it knows it comes with the territory.

227
 Chapter 12: Forming a Winning Team: Marketing and Sales Cohesion
When sales staff complain that marketing leads aren’t ‘ready to buy’ (that is, 
when a handover occurs – see the shaded area in Figure 12-3), my answer is, 
talk to them about it. Tell them what you want in a lead, but remember that 
some leads seem ready, but aren’t. Give marketing feedback and then cut the 
staff some slack. After all, you may find a diamond in the dross tomorrow. 
You don’t find out unless you talk to them, and skillful qualification can turn 
up a business problem that a customer didn’t know it had.
‘Come On, Come On, Let’s Stick 
Together!’ Marketing and Sales 
Can Collaborate
Imagine a 100-meter relay race, in which teams of four athletes compete 
against each other to run 400 meters in total as quickly as possible. A swift, 
smooth, on-the-move handover of the baton is often the crucial moment in 
winning. Now imagine that one runner refuses to take the baton because it’s 
not perfectly positioned, or perhaps the preceding runner insists on throwing 
the baton to him before he’s ready. Without doubt, this un-co-operative team 
is going to come in last (if the members finish at all and don’t resort to brawl-
ing part way around the track!). Clearly the team in which all four members 
understand the strengths, limits and roles of the others is more likely to win.
Investing in marketing to drive revenue
Chapman’s business was entirely driven by 
speaking engagements. Every time he spoke 
at a conference, people wanted to work with 
his company. Problem was, he had little time to 
focus on sales, so although he closed business 
from his speaking engagements, he could’ve 
been driving a lot more business than he did.
He hired a marketing intern, Rajesh, to manage 
which conferences he should go to, make all 
the arrangements and do a bit of pre-event 
marketing. Rajesh went with him to confer-
ences and took responsibility for following up 
with everyone, creating a pipeline of leads as 
well as supporting Chapman with sales mate-
rials, scheduling and follow up. Chapman 
increased his business by 75 percent in one 
year and was able to hire a salesperson to work 
alongside Rajesh.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
In this section, I cover some of the contentious issues that arise between 
sales and marketing. I also provide responses and actions you can take to 
help the two departments work for the common goal of increased business 
for your company.
Clearing up misunderstandings that 
threaten unified business  
development
Sales should welcome any support it can get, whether leads or great collat-
eral (brochures, case studies, presentations). Selling is hard enough, but if 
sales doesn’t have the right infrastructure, the staff spend time compensating 
for that, instead of working with prospects.
Similarly, marketing needs to be responsive to the needs of salespeople, pro-
vide what they want and listen carefully to feedback about what they hear 
when they have conversations with prospects.
	
Here’s the good news for the salespeople. If they try to qualify a lead and it 
doesn’t work out at that time, they can throw it back over the fence for mar-
keting to nurture, while gaining themselves precious sales time with their 
active opportunities.
Sales is always going to need to generate leads of its own, but nothing’s 
sweeter than an incoming lead or a contact that has matured to the point of 
being ready to buy.
Even so, a few areas of tension occur frequently between marketing and 
sales. When you understand the following issues, you’re well placed to 
combat them:
	
✓	Sales likes to go straight for the jugular and qualify any contact by dig-
ging into whether he’s ready to buy. That’s understandable – the staff 
are on the hook for results. I know that the best salespeople don’t do 
this, but a lot of others still do.
	
	Marketing doesn’t agree with this approach – it opts for understanding 
where the contact is in the lifecycle and providing the right communica-
tion. Heads butt regularly over this topic. But now that you know, you 
can foresee it and smooth the relationship.
	
✓	When a lead contacts your business, sales is entitled to qualify the lead 
if they can. If the lead comes from a marketing program, however, it 
isn’t the same as a sales-generated one. A gap always exists between 
marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) and sales-qualified leads (SQLs) (the 
shaded area in Figure 12-3), because some MQLs have to be recycled to 
marketing.

229
 Chapter 12: Forming a Winning Team: Marketing and Sales Cohesion
	
	The gap isn’t the result of marketing producing ‘bad’ leads. Sales can be 
vocal about this topic and causes unjustified offence to marketing in the 
process. Make sure that both sides appreciate the other’s requirements.
	
✓	Sales doesn’t like tire-kickers, that is, people who have vague interest 
in what your firm does, but no buying intent right now. Some of these 
tire-kickers may want to buy some day, some won’t. Marketing and sales 
have a joint responsibility to convert prospective customers into quali-
fied leads and into actual customers. They play different roles at differ-
ent times and they need to come together and appreciate and respect 
each other’s capabilities and contribution.
	
	Contacts aren’t trying to waste anyone’s time; they’re trying to get what 
they need right now (even time-wasters with their own agenda are enti-
tled to pursue it).
	
✓	Sales has to respond quickly to provide information that keeps the sale 
moving forward. Marketing should work closely with sales to under-
stand what it needs to do to support the sales process and provide 
flexible, well-written and well-presented materials that sales can quickly 
adapt.
	
	Don’t have sales staff spending time writing collateral – this activity is 
not usually their strength and is a waste of their time. Marketing gets 
pretty aerated when sales staff create ‘ad-hoc’ materials, because they 
so often go off-brand: in other words, they wreck the careful, patient 
work of marketing in creating and working within the specific position-
ing and messaging that presents the company in the best light.
Now, I’m painting a dire picture here and some sales and marketing people 
can justifiably say that they never behave this way, but I’ve seen this adver-
sarial situation over and over. An alternative scenario is that the owners want 
growth but are in denial that marketing is needed. They’re holding on to an 
old-world view that all they need is more salespeople.
	
The market isn’t interested in sales approaches that are 10–20 years out of 
date. They’re voting with their fingers and going online for a bit of self-service. 
That’s what marketing can provide.
Have you ever found yourself thinking, ‘My business is plateauing – I’ll just 
hire another salesperson’? No, don’t – unless you have particularly strong 
leads coming into sales but just too many of them (great problem, right?).
	
If your salespeople are expected to produce all the leads, hiring new salespeo-
ple or replacing existing ones rarely works. You just end up burning your way 
through perfectly good people who tap out their own network within a year 
and then dry up – unless they’re that one-in-a-hundred salesperson who really 
can self-generate. And boy, are they expensive to hire!

The situation that I describe in the preceding section isn’t the be-all-and-end-
all, fortunately. But in a complex customer experience cycle, lots of infor-
mation is flying around and plenty of opportunities exist for the ball to get 
dropped.
One of the biggest complaints by target contacts is that when they do call or 
fill in a web form, they don’t hear back, or they have to wait 24–72 hours for a 
call. If your organization can honestly say that this never happens, you are so 
the exception.
To expand your marketing channels, you’re likely to need new employees and 
some different tactics, processes and systems to ensure that you don’t ignore 
opportunities to make another sale.
In the earlier Table 12-1, I look at who does what when. Here I discuss a few 
key tactics that bring marketing and sales closer together:
	
✓	Provide multiple ways for prospective customers to connect with 
you. Advertise, push content out there, be active in online groups, have 
a web form on your website, send out newsletters and attend events. 
Measure what each channel produces and use the productive ones. 
Everyone in your business will be happy.
	
✓	Don’t lose data. When you get contact information, have a place to put 
it and a way of letting the right person know what needs to happen next. 
Start by thinking this process through in advance – how do incoming 
calls get handled, where do you enter that stack of business cards you 
picked up at a networking event, what do you do with a referral? Your 
systems need to cope with the complexity of handling relationships at 
all stages of the lifecycle. See Chapters 10 and 11 for marketing systems 
and Chapter 13 for sales/customer management systems.
	
✓	Be consistent in your approach to capturing data, nurturing leads and 
qualifying them, and then selling to them and delivering. You need to 
define the criteria for passing a contact from one stage in the lifecycle to 
the next, for example from marketing to sales, or from sales to delivery. 
Some are obvious – if a customer signs a contract, sales obviously has to 
hand over to delivery, but defining what information needs to be handed 
over is essential. This applies equally to all stages of the customer lifecy-
cle. Miss something and everyone’s life becomes a misery. Your systems 
need to capture data all along the lifecycle, so make sure that they’re 
flexible enough.

 Chapter 12: Forming a Winning Team: Marketing and Sales Cohesion
	
✓	Reduce the MQL/SQL gap. The key here is qualification. A marketing 
lead has passed certain tests, but they’re not the same tests as sales 
applies to a lead. If you can agree what an MQL looks like so that a sales-
person is willing to talk to the lead, you’re off to a good start. Over time, 
if you keep the conversation going, the gap narrows as each party gets 
better aligned with the other. Review qualification criteria and ques-
tions, data needs and rules around transitioning a contact from one 
stage to another regularly, and make sure that all this information is 
available and up to date.
	
✓	Provide rich collateral and content for the whole team to use. Find a 
central storage place and encourage people to use it for materials they 
need, instead of using collateral or content they’ve had on their own 
laptop or tablet for a while.
You don’t want so much process that it drives people crazy, but most folks 
quickly forget what they said to a contact last week. Therefore, define the mini-
mum information that you need to capture and have some simple checklists 
to make sure that the right data gets captured at the right time. It removes one 
reason for marketing and sales to fight.
Helping marketing and sales to get on
The culture of an organization starts at the top. When the ownership of a 
company values marketing and sales equally, this belief permeates the orga-
nization. In contrast, you’re wasting investment if you hire people and then 
expect them to overcome existing internal prejudices: you’re simply setting 
up those new people for failure.
Assuming that you’re committed to a balanced organization, how on earth 
are you going to get marketing and sales to get on? After all, sales is from 
Mars, marketing is from Venus. (I wish I’d coined that, but the observation is 
from Emily Coleman from Competitive Advantage Marketing.)
Here are a few things to think about as you start to tackle your sales and mar-
keting alignment project:
	
✓	Choose how to handle the leadership of marketing and sales. Best 
models are: (a) for both to report to the owner/CEO, or (b) marketing to 
report to sales, assuming that your sales leader is knowledgeable about 
and supportive of marketing.
	
✓	Break the corporate strategy down to make the work of marketing and 
sales a joint strategy. Carry out this process collaboratively. Agree on 
metrics that can be measured and contribute to the strategic goal. See 
Chapter 6 for examples of metrics that make a difference.

Part III: Making the Most of Marketing 
	
	The most important metric is deal closure (for both parties). But for 
marketing, I also like to measure how many proposals came from mar-
keting leads, as a secondary measure, at least until the two sides trust 
each other enough to be jointly accountable for the sales result.
	
✓	Create a customer-centric model for the lifecycle and map marketing, 
sales and delivery to that lifecycle. Build your processes around that 
lifecycle. For example, consider what constitutes a move from one stage 
in the lifecycle to another from the customer’s viewpoint. Some orga-
nizations go as far as renaming the standard funnel stages (Figure 8-3) 
from internally focused terms, such as ‘lead’, ‘qualification’ and so on, 
to more customer-centric terms, such as ‘need acknowledged’ and ‘need 
defined’. (In fairness, this strategy is probably for a well-established 
team: the faint-hearted don’t want to try changing how marketing and 
sales has talked about the funnel for 50 years or more.)
	
	The point is to drag your team back to the customer’s viewpoint when-
ever it seems to be getting inwardly focused.
	
✓	Add a lead qualification representative to manage all incoming leads 
and collect data/qualify them before handing over to sales. This role is 
typically for marketing, but definitely forms a bridge between marketing 
and sales.
	
✓	Use best practices from sales (such as interacting one-on-one with 
prospects). Make sure that sales gets what’s valuable to it at that time 
and build that into the marketing programs.
	
✓	Choose what data points are really valuable to know as you progress 
your relationship with a target customer. Marketing is particularly 
good at gathering data that’s highly beneficial to sales. Some of this 
data can be accumulated automatically; from data sources, customers 
providing information about themselves and data gathered about their 
behavior. Some data has to be researched manually. More and more, 
though, systems for collecting data are becoming more automated (such 
as capturing contact data from your website and feeding it into your SFA 
or MA systems – see Chapter 11). The better you know prospects, the 
better you get at recognizing which ones are really primed to buy. Data 
can also tell whether you need to adjust your services, or even create 
new ones.
	
✓	Define how quickly leads need to be responded to and by whom. List 
all your lead sources and agree a timeframe for responding and whether 
a lead qualification rep or a salesperson will call.
	
✓	Set regular pre-brief/debrief meetings between sales and marketing. 
Review what’s working and what’s not, what sales is hearing in the market 
what marketing is seeing in market, upcoming campaigns, goals and 
results, and so on.

 Chapter 12: Forming a Winning Team: Marketing and Sales Cohesion
	
✓	Think about compensation. Sales has typically been ‘base salary + com-
mission’, whereas marketing is used to a base, maybe with an annual 
bonus. The time may be right to consider a more commission-based 
approach to marketing compensation too. Just make sure that this 
approach is tied to metrics that marketing can actually impact (which is 
why I suggest that you write proposals as a good measure).
	
Aligning marketing and sales is a long-term proposition, no matter how agile 
you are in creating the strategy. Results take time to manifest on the ground 
and ongoing refinement to improve them. Stay committed and keep at it.

Becoming the Leader of 
the (Sales) Pack
In This Chapter
▶	Leading your business to sales success
▶	Assembling and leading a team
▶	Driving forward your sales process
L
 
ike armies, sports teams and husbands, business departments need 
leaders with vision, insight, energy and commitment (good personal 
hygiene doesn’t go amiss either, because you’re unlikely to follow a leader 
you can’t get within three feet of!).
Sales is no different. Sales is the lifeblood, the driver, of business growth and 
success, so it has to be a central part of business development. If you don’t 
know who’s on your prospective customer list, who your next three custom-
ers are likely to be or whether to hire or layoff staff, you require good sales 
leadership. Without it, your plan for the growth of your business is going to 
be hobbled right out of the starting gate.
But business development is about more than sales and simply winning new 
business, so this chapter helps you move beyond the typical sales cycle and 
into genuine business growth. I help you prepare for sales leadership and 
discuss its day-to-day concerns: put simply, that’s plan and then do. I cover 
the things you need to think about and aim to help you enable salespeople to 
succeed (whether that’s you or a team of others). I guide you in identifying 
key areas on which you need to focus your leadership to drive good business 
practice for all involved.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
Appreciating the Importance 
of Sales Leadership
Sales without leadership is like a rudderless ship – you may go somewhere, 
but it probably won’t be where you want to. Whether you’re experienced in 
sales or not, this section shows you how to enhance sales success through 
your leadership. No surprise that you create a direct impact on your com-
pany’s revenue, customer list and projects when you become a great head of 
sales. Even if you’re the solitary salesperson, this section helps you to think 
like a leader and enhance your sales results.
As the leader, you need to do the groundwork upfront to make sure that you 
give sales (or marketing or customer management) a new lease of life. Then 
you need to nurture sales as a discipline. In this section I take a look at know-
ing your product or service inside out, building an effective and clear sales 
process, using sales tools to best effect, and setting goals and using metrics.
As leaders, everyone comes with in-built strengths and weaknesses. As you 
grow, one of the most important moves you make is to get help in the area of 
your weaknesses. Check out the chapters in Parts I and II as necessary and 
revisit them as your business expands.
	
Don’t try to get leadership perfectly right and don’t go it alone. As you plan 
for sales and then execute on your plan, use other people as a resource to 
help you, in the planning and in the execution. Value implementing your plan 
quickly over seeking perfection. No matter how solid your plan looks, you 
need to tweak and change it frequently. The world isn’t unchanging so your 
sales plan can’t afford to be either.
	
Perhaps you’re wondering how to identify your strengths and weaknesses. 
Well, if you jump out of bed in the morning because you can’t wait to do some-
thing, that’s a strength. If you’re procrastinating about something on a regular 
basis, that’s a weakness. When you encounter a topic in this chapter that 
doesn’t sound like fun, take that as a sign to pay more attention to it, give it 
extra effort and monitor it carefully. Until you can afford to hire someone else 
to do it, that is.
Getting clear what your business sells
Salespeople often talk about knowing their sales bag – in other words, the 
products or services that they’re supposed to sell. The same is true for you 
in your leadership role. Clarity and unity are crucial so that you can ensure 
that all your company’s employees are pulling in the same direction.

 Chapter 13: Becoming the Leader of the (Sales) Pack
	
As a leader, your responsibility is to make sure that your organization is clear 
about what it’s selling. If you think that’s obvious, have a go at the following 
experiment.
	
Ask everyone in your organization (management too) to write down what 
your company sells. If possible, do this anonymously and request that people 
don’t consult with each other. Perhaps use a suggestion box in the office or an 
online survey using a tool such as Survey Monkey if your people are remote. 
Do this exercise yourself too and compare what you write with the responses 
from others. Afterwards, ask yourself how well aligned your business is.
Some organizations have a large sales bag – lots of things that the salesper-
son can offer the customer. This is typical for bigger companies selling to 
larger organizations who need many complex products and services. More 
likely you have a limited number of things to sell and that’s a good thing for a 
small company.
If you’re not sure what belongs in your bag, take a look at Chapter 5 where 
you can create your offer (the foundation of your sales bag). Make sure that 
the whole organization is clear on what you’re selling.
Salespeople can be tempted to sell what’s easiest. You, as a leader concerned 
with business development, may have other priorities, for example:
	
✓	Selling a balanced mix from the bag
	
✓	Selling what’s most profitable
	
✓	Selling the deal that results in a retained customer, one who pays 
monthly fees or buys regularly
Keeping the balance right
Jim has a thriving software-as-a-service busi-
ness (offering an online accounting system for 
small businesses) but he needed to increase 
the size of his contracts – too many small clients 
requiring a lot of handholding were reducing his 
profitability. He started monitoring contract size 
in his pipeline. Immediately, he was spending 
more time with larger prospective customers 
and closing bigger deals.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
	
Monitor net new customers (customers that you’ve never done business with 
before) to make sure that you’re getting the business mix you want. How 
often depends on how many new customers you acquire over what period. 
If you close several a month, do it monthly; if only one or two a quarter, do it 
quarterly. As a benchmark of where you are today, take a look at your current 
­customer roster to see what the mix looks like. Are you happy with where it 
is? If this roster is unbalanced, you can identify where you can work with the 
team to fix that.
Establishing a sales process
When the bag’s packed and everyone knows what you’re selling (as I discuss 
in the preceding section), you need to define a sales process that the team 
can follow to ensure clarity on what to do, when and how. A sales process 
also gives you, as leader, a foundation for monitoring and measuring how 
sales is performing.
Investigating whether you need a sales process
Your customers take a journey when they consider a service like yours. 
Seek to understand your customer’s buying journey as closely as you can 
(Chapter 3 helps you map it).
	
A sales process is your view of the customer’s buying journey, with the steps, 
tasks, recording, procedures and resources that allow your sales team to 
manage the buyer’s journey effectively.
	
Don’t become a slave to your process. Sales is a mix of art and science – the 
sales process is part of the science. Be ready and willing to break the rules 
when doing so is called for (see Chapter 14 for ideas on being creative in the 
sales process).
Sorting the mess into a process
Jenny’s online marketing business is always 
busy – with never an end to what she can do 
for her customers and their marketing. She 
describes her service as feeling like ‘how 
long is a piece of string?’. Her desk is littered 
with client work and lots of colored sticky 
notes. When I ask to see her sales pipeline 
(of prospective clients), she points to her desk 
and says ‘in there, somewhere’.
So we created a simple process to manage the 
mess into planned and purposeful activity. In 
other words, we instituted a sales process that 
was a good fit for her business.

 Chapter 13: Becoming the Leader of the (Sales) Pack
As you map your sales process with your team, you create the steps, tasks 
and other parameters to allow your team to operate with consistency. If you 
don’t have a sales process, Table 13-1 shows why you probably need one.
Table 13-1	
Do You Need a Sales Process?
Without a Sales Process
With a Sales Process
Sales management and tool use is 
weak.
Robust tools are driving the sales pro-
cess: robust data capture, good report-
ing, predictability.
The sale is more luck than judgment. 
Salespeople do what their guts tell 
them for any specific prospect.
You can see what needs attention and 
what can wait. You can also respond to 
changing circumstances quickly.
Key questions don’t get asked. 
Success is based on luck, not on rigor.
You have a focus for your leadership – 
with information you have the power 
to ask the right questions and drive the 
right results.
Key steps get missed, which can result 
in misunderstandings, backtracking, 
lost opportunities or, worse still, a 
nightmare contract.
The process and its supporting man-
agement tools provide a framework 
for consistent sale behavior and catch 
issues before they become a problem.
Team members vary in how they report 
their progress.
Everyone on the team is reporting on 
progress in the same way.
Sales becomes a robust discipline in your company with a sales process.
Mapping your sales process
	
Review the following list and identify the items that are relevant to your busi-
ness and can support your sales team:
	
✓	Stages in the sales process: See whether you can clearly identify dis-
tinct stages (for example, qualification, proposal, negotiation), and if so 
break your sales process into logical and sequential steps. Design each 
stage to have a distinct purpose. Ensure that you have pre-requisites for 
moving a deal from one stage to another.
	
✓	Tasks at each stage: Unless this is obvious, note the typical tasks or 
activities at each stage.
	
✓	Who does what: If selling is collaborative (for example, the salesperson 
needs to bring in a subject matter expert or an owner at a specific point 
in the sale), document the roles and responsibilities in your sales pro-
cess (for more details, see the later section ‘Engaging in collaborative 
selling’).

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
	
✓	Resources: Beyond the people on your team, if you have resources (for 
example, sales collateral, qualification questionnaires, proposal formats, 
quotation forms or services agreements), note where and how they need 
to be used.
	
Some sales process maps include marketing and customer management (that 
is, they map the entire customer lifecycle I cover in Chapter 3). Your choice, 
of course, but here I focus on creating just the sales process map. You can 
extend the map if you need to later.
The simpler you can make your sales process, the better, but don’t make it 
so simple that it lacks value for the sales team. If you have inexperienced 
salespeople, the sales process map becomes an educational tool as well as 
a process to follow. If you can, use your team to help you build the sales 
­process – after all, they’re the ones out in the field doing the selling.
	
Choose a format for your sales process map that’s most effective for your 
business and team. Flowcharts, spreadsheets, tables, diagrams and presenta-
tions are all good formats. You can also choose between maps that are stage-, 
role-, resource- or task-based – many are a blend of all these types. Just make 
sure that you provide a quick guide (something that can be pinned above a 
desk for day-to-day reference).
Figure 13-1 shows a sample sales process.
	
You can find the template at www.dummies.com/go/businessdevelopment 
or, if that’s not a perfect fit for you, search for sales process maps online and 
especially look at some of the images. You’re sure to find one that works for 
your company and team.
Allocating responsibility
A sales process needs to highlight who’s responsible for doing all the tasks, 
recording all the information, progressing the sales, writing contracts and 
managing the whole complex process. In a complicated services sale, quite a 
number of people can be involved in getting to a win.
Table 13-2 shows examples of roles that are typical in the sales process – 
adapt it to your own situation. Don’t think that you have to go out and hire a 
bunch of people to be successful in sales. In a small company, typically one 
or two people do marketing and selling, supported by people from the deliv-
ery team, who may be the same two people! The reason for breaking down 
the roles (as you see them) is to help you plan for growth. As things get busy, 
you soon realize who you need to hire first.

Table 13-2	
Roles in the Sales Process
Role
Responsibility
Salesperson (see Chapter 1 if you don’t 
have a salesperson)
Being the lead person on the sale. 
Executing the sales process for spe-
cific opportunities. Co-ordinating com-
munication with the prospect/customer 
and co-ordinating the rest of the team.
Marketing co-ordination
Providing company messaging, col-
lateral and other resources. These 
resources may be general, but can 
also be specific to this sale, for 
example, when the salesperson needs 
a vertical (industry) twist to the story. 
Also demand generation for email and 
other ways of generating leads.
Subject matter expert (usually some-
one who delivers the service to the 
customer)
Providing in-depth knowledge of your 
services and/or the products that you 
implement and how they’re delivered 
into the sales process. This person can 
be someone from another company 
(as in an alliance or partnership; see 
Chapter 20).
Project manager (usually some-
one who delivers the service to the 
customer)
Creating the project timeline, 
resources needed and costs (or co-
ordinating those elements of your pro-
posal with others on the delivery team).
Proposal writing
Assembling the proposal or response 
to a more formal Request For 
Information/Request For Quote/
Request For Proposal from the pros-
pect. Managing the quality of the 
proposal.
Contract co-ordination
Drafting the contract, statement of 
work, services agreement.
Sales leadership
Coaching the team. Providing expert 
advice where needed and suggesting 
approaches that increase the likeli-
hood of a sale.
As a leader, you need to ensure the following:
	
✓	You’re gradually building towards a robust sales function that’s well 
supported.

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
245
 Chapter 13: Becoming the Leader of the (Sales) Pack
	
✓	Clarity exists as to who’s responsible for what (several roles can be allo-
cated to one person).
	
✓	People know what they can rely on others for.
	
✓	People are clear what they need to do themselves, namely, what you 
hold them accountable for.
Sounds elementary, doesn’t it? Just check, though – do you have some of the 
basics in place, such as job descriptions, including accountabilities? Or an 
organization chart?
	
Even if you’re a small business (say less than ten people), it needs to cover 
certain functions. Your organization chart may have your name or your busi-
ness partner’s name in many of the leadership boxes right now, but if you 
create the role descriptions for each business function, you know what you’re 
looking for when you hire the next employee.
Job descriptions are a great starting point for sales process accountabilities. 
Say that your project manager has a general accountability in her job descrip-
tion for ‘supporting net new sales by providing budgets and time estimates 
to sales staff’. You can translate that into a sales role document as shown 
in Table 13-3. Basically, take the responsibility from Table 13-2 and extend it 
to tasks, and if appropriate, to expected results.
Table 13-3	
Sample Role Description

results-based compensation.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
You need to define your own role for your day-to-day involvement in sales. 
Although the salespeople are in charge of specific opportunities, you’re pres-
ent to drive success and that takes oversight, for example, asking the team 
probing questions about progress with the sale, making suggestions (things 
the team may try to push along a slow sale), getting a decision or negotiating 
powerfully.
	
Try not to jump in and sell for them. Doing so may be tempting if you’re the 
best closer in the company, but you don’t encourage growth by undermining 
your sales team’s confidence. Being in the process is okay – just make sure 
that your team knows that you’re there to help but that they must lead the 
sale.
If you’re a one- or two-person business, all the above may seem like overkill. 
Just think of it as planning for your larger business and what better time to do 
that than now. To my mind, if you act like a larger business, you become one.
Tooling up for sales
With a sales bag and a sale process in hand, you need two additional types of 
resource for the sales team:
	
✓	Marketing resources (see Chapter 10): Company positioning, website 
and case studies (broadly, all types of ‘collateral’ information). Ideally, 
marketing is also driving leads for the sales team.
	
✓	Sales resources: A sales management tool, usually called a Sales Force 
Automation or a Customer Relationship Management (SFA/CRM tool), 
to manage the work (see the sidebar ‘Giving your sales process a kick-
start’). Also, sales-specific assets such as qualification questionnaires, 
presentations, quote/proposal formats and contracts. These items are 
unique to your business. Also helpful can be ‘battlecards’ or ‘playbooks’ 
(which I cover in Chapter 14).
If you’re already using a sales management tool (such as ACT! or Salesforce), 
that’s great. Skip to the next section.
	
Here are a few things to consider as you look at the options for your sales 
management tool:
	
✓	How many people are going to use it (some services have a minimum 
number of ‘seats’, though some don’t)?
	
✓	Do you want a solution that can serve marketing as well as sales?

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
247
 Chapter 13: Becoming the Leader of the (Sales) Pack
	
✓	Do you want your solution to be a one-stop shop for sales (resource, 
lead, opportunity, task and reporting management system) or are you 
willing to have additional solutions for managing other resources such 
as collateral, proposals, contracts and sales notes?
	
✓	Are you willing to accept the solution ‘as is’ or do you want to be able 
to customize it to your process, capture the data you want and produce 
the reports you require?
Find out what others in your type of business are using and do a bit of online 
research. You can even do a free trial for 30-days on certain solutions. Just 
make sure that you can get your data in easily and out again at the end of the 
trial if you change your mind.
If really necessary, you can manage your sales, contacts, opportunities and 
pipeline in a spreadsheet – doing so is better than nothing. Ideally, use a 
shared one on Google Docs or Microsoft OneDrive. With a spreadsheet you 
miss out on the value of the data that a sales tool collects over time, however, 
and that becomes a valuable resource for your business development.
	
If you’ve hired a salesperson who’s worth her salt, that person expects a 
‘proper’ sales management tool. If she doesn’t, you may be dealing with some-
one who operates in a lone-wolf style and trades in ‘fluff’ rather than in results 
(for more on fluff, read the later section ‘Supporting sales’).
Giving your sales process a kick-start
If you don’t have a sales management tool 
(SFA/CRM), you need one to provide the 
framework and resources within which your 
sales process comes alive. Think about it like 
this: if you have more than a couple of people 
involved, or if your sales process has quite a 
few steps and is complex or fairly lengthy, you 
need a sophisticated tool to support that sales 
process. If you’re a one-man or one-woman 
band, you still need a tool but it can be a little 
simpler.
Having a tool doesn’t drive results. You have to 
use it effectively too. Here are some of the ben-
efits of a sophisticated sales tool:
	✓	You have a single place for management 
contacts, tasks, activities, notes, completed 
proposals and opportunity pipeline.
	✓	You can store all your marketing and sales 
resources together and be confident that 
you’re using the most up-to-date versions.
	✓	You have a reporting function that helps you 
examine your performance.
Fortunately, a whole host of sales tools are 
offered as services. I recommend that small 
businesses use online software as a service 
(SaaS) such as Capsule, Zoho or Salesforce. You 
have lots of options and fairly low monthly fees.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
Setting goals and metrics
When you have a sales process and sales tools (check out the two preceding 
sections), you’re able to set goals and metrics (quantitative measures that 
you check periodically) specific to the sorts of results you want to see –  
which is a crucial part of business development. For example, you should 
have your revenue goals for the year already established. Break that down 
into revenue from repeat or ongoing customers and revenue from net new 
customers.
	
Be cautious forecasting net revenue. In services businesses, payment is often 
hourly or milestone-based (payment made when certain work is completed) 
or at the end of the contract. When your typical sales cycle is three months 
from the point when a real opportunity emerges, you don’t see revenue from 
deals being closed in the first quarter of your financial year until the end of 
the fourth month. You can have stretch goals and dream big, but forecast 
conservatively.
Table 13-4 shows some things that you can measure. The table isn’t exhaustive, 
just suggestions, so adjust it to suit your own business. If you’ve never really 
measured things much, choose just two or three to start with – suggested ones 
are in bold in the table.

Choose what matters to your business, but don’t overdo it. You don’t want 
to be digging up the plant every few days to see how it’s doing. Trust your 
process and people, but inspect based on your metrics. You can do so at a 
company-wide level or by individual.
Building and Leading Your  
Sales Dream Team
Whatever kind of leader you see yourself as – Marlon Brando in The Wild 
One, Yul Brynner in The Magnificent Seven or Woody Allen in Antz! – one 
thing’s for sure: sales isn’t a ‘lone-wolf’ activity, especially in the services 
sector. To be honest, the lone-wolf scenario only works for tenacious investi-
gators in detective movies (and of course for anti-social wolves). As the term 
‘sales team’ implies, sales is a group game, so you need a pack of like-minded 
animals all pulling on the same direction.
The right sales pack is essential to successful business development, because 
sales people do better when they learn from and support each other, and you 
need other team players, people from marketing and delivery, to sell success-
fully and hence to grow your business. In this section, I cover identifying your 
core team needs, contacting other people who can help and signing up team 
members.
	
Unless you’re a one-person business with big ambitions, you need to involve 
the people responsible for delivering your service in the sales process (see 
the earlier section ‘Establishing a sales process’) at key points.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
Creating your pack of sales maestros
	
Select or confirm your team from your employees or trusted contractors, but 
bear in mind that the sales process involves a lot of skill sets and someone 
who’s great at selling isn’t necessarily going to be great at writing contracts. 
Some shifting around of responsibility may be necessary, so rolling out a sales 
process requires sensitivity.
The other big decision is whether you want sales to be continuous with deliv-
ery: for example, an account manager can be a salesperson and the project 
manager, or you can have a salesperson handover to an account or project 
manager for delivery. When planning your team, you need to be clear about 
whether a handover is involved and when.
	
I like salespeople to be motivated for net new sales, namely sales that bring 
in brand new customers. Otherwise, they can be tempted to upsell existing 
clients (persuade them to buy additional services) because doing so is easier 
(this practice is termed going after low-hanging fruit). If your delivery cycle is 
short and highly focused on a single offer, the continuous model can be prefer-
able. You choose.
Figure 13-2 shows a typical team structure and who does what. Adapt the 
organization chart to your company situation and put names in the boxes – 
often the same name in many boxes for a smaller business.
Figure 13-2: 
Organization 
chart for 
a services 
firm.
	
As your business grows, the organization chart is sure to grow too, usually by 
splitting the functions you’ve already identified. Make sure that your original 
organization chart shows the major functions that you need to ‘grow into’.

 Chapter 13: Becoming the Leader of the (Sales) Pack
Using people outside the pack
Beyond a core sales term, small businesses need a network of what I call 
‘friends and family’: the business connections, long-standing clients, partners 
and advocates interested in your success.
	
Think about your network and choose a small number of individuals you 
know well, who can support your efforts and who’ll be straight with you. For 
example:
	
✓	Sales leaders that you admire
	
✓	Your business coach or mentor
	
✓	Contacts in companies who are a perfect fit for your services
	
✓	Leaders from your key business partners
	
✓	Executives who’ve run a business like yours
You can use these people in a variety of ways:
	
✓	To refer leads
	
✓	To be a sounding board for new ideas
	
✓	To provide advice when business development isn’t going as you 
planned
Enroll your business friends and family in your sales process and create 
scheduled opportunities to interact with one or two of them.
	
Don’t expect them to be thinking about you all the time – you need to be pro-
active to benefit from the relationship. Your internal sales team won’t always 
tell you how things really are, but your business friends and family will.
	
My Vistage coach (www.vistage.com) has had a huge impact on my busi-
ness life and growth, and as a bonus he previously led a successful sales team. 
He helped me with my organization planning and growth strategies, especially 
when I started to expand geographically.
Enrolling people to execute  
your sales strategy
When your sales pack is identified, at least in your head, you can start to 
think about leading them. You may not have every last detail solidified 
yet, but as long as you have a reasonable sales process (check out the ear-
lier ‘Establishing a sales process’ section), goals for the forthcoming year,

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
ideas on how to measure things and brief roles, responsibilities and results 
expected from each person, you’re in good shape to start enrolling your 
team.
	
I sign up team members with a one-on-one meeting. Make sure that you 
remember that they all have their own career goals, strengths, weaknesses 
and concerns. In the meetings, consider the following aspects:
	
✓	Highlight your business goals – revenue goals, percentage growth, 
number of new customers.
	
✓	Explain that you’re establishing a new sales process to help drive those 
results.
	
✓	Tell members that you need their expertise/want to provide a new 
career opportunity/expand their roles and responsibilities.
	
✓	Outline detailed roles and responsibilities (as in Table 13-3).
	
✓	Discuss workloads and compensation.
	
When the team’s done, what about you? Having conversations with yourself in 
the office isn’t a good idea (men in white coats and all that), but you do need 
to review your own role(s) and responsibilities and ask yourself whether you 
can do them all effectively. Specifically, can you delegate anything?
Give people a chance to meet with you a second time to share their feed-
back. They may have questions, concerns or ideas and you want to hear 
those before you do a whole team meeting. Also, ask them to think about 
how they’re going to deliver on their role and their results and to bring those 
ideas to the sales kick-off meeting, because they’ll be presenting them.
In the first whole-team meeting, cover the big picture and pull the team 
together:
	
✓	Reiterate the goals.
	
✓	Review the sales process – walk through it in detail.
	
✓	Clarify roles and responsibilities and have the team members outline 
their ideas.
	
✓	Acknowledge everyone’s contribution to future success.
	
✓	Ask for ideas and concerns.
	
✓	Discuss metrics (as I describe in the earlier section ‘Setting goals and 
metrics’) and lay ground rules.
	
Keep your sales process fluid in the detail – team ideas can be particularly 
insightful and anything they add increases ownership and commitment.

 Chapter 13: Becoming the Leader of the (Sales) Pack
Delving Deeper into Leading  
the Sales Process
Have you noticed how business operates more smoothly when everyone 
knows who’s doing what and in what order? That’s what a process brings – 
order, consistency, thoroughness. Thinking through what your sales process 
should be (always with your prospects in mind, of course) helps your people 
sell more efficiently and avoid pitfalls, such as forgetting to ask the customer 
certain critical questions, or doing a poor job of presenting your solution. 
Owning the process, making it solid, yet flexible, gives sales leaders the 
results to hang their hat on – new sales.
In this section I discuss some areas of sales leadership to review further, 
before you move onto a step-by-step analysis of the sales process (for details, 
see the earlier section ‘Establishing a sales process’) and how to work it on 
the ground with your team. I describe handling your sales pipeline and lead-
ing the sale process, collaborating successfully, addressing issues effectively 
and acting appropriately in a timely manner.
	
If you’re in doubt where to spend your sales time, use 75 percent of it coaching 
and co-selling (supporting a team member in an actual sale) and 25 percent in 
administration, including sales meetings. I describe what to do in coaching/
co-selling versus administration in this section and Chapters 14 and 15.
‘Put that it your pipe and smoke it!’ 
Managing a sales pipeline
The heart of your sales process is the pipeline (that is, a list of prospective 
customers who are actively engaged in discussions with your firm). You 
use it to maintain a clear picture of the health of your sales activity. If you 
don’t have a handle on this aspect, you’re managing by guesswork. Plenty of 
models exist for pipelines, but most have the features shown in Figure 13-3.
	
You can’t have a dependable pipeline without good data, so you need to 
enforce the following:
	
✓	Weekly updating of the opportunity stage (where the prospect is in the 
process), probability of closure percentage (an estimate of the likelihood 
of getting a sale) and next steps (what action you’ll take to push the sale 
forward)
	
✓	Supporting notes and everything sent to the prospect, posted to your 
sales tool or on some other shared resource (such as SharePoint, Google 
Docs or a shared hard drive)
	
✓	Keeping all emails between team members and the customer

Update your pipeline weekly and make it available for the whole team. This 
pipeline can be a focus for your weekly team meetings (see the later section 
‘Excelling at team meetings’).

 Chapter 13: Becoming the Leader of the (Sales) Pack
If your sales tool allows (or on a spreadsheet if not), start forecasting the 
revenues from each deal in the pipeline and in which month that revenue will 
hit. Figure 13-4 contains a typical snapshot of such a spreadsheet, using the 
pipeline from Figure 13-3.
	
Use a weighted number for the revenue that you forecast monthly (split the 
overall contract value into months and multiply by the probability of closure 
of the opportunity). Notice, how, when all these are added up and combined 
with your backlog numbers (revenue predictions from signed contracts), it 
forecasts your future revenue. This spreadsheet tool helps you predict rev-
enue, think about resources need and even plan recruiting.
Knowing where your pipeline stands is the key to business predictability and 
success.
Working your sales process
	
Here are the key leadership tasks for working the sales process:
	
✓	Team meetings
	
✓	Supporting sales efforts for specific prospects/coaching individual team 
members
	
✓	Thinking inside and outside the process, that is, use your process but be 
prepared to be creative when needed
	
✓	Periodic reviews
Even if you’re working alone on sales, review the progress regularly from a 
leadership perspective or, better still, with one of your trusted advisors – and 
do so monthly.
	
Put in place and provide leadership for scheduled meetings and a culture of 
being on time and being prepared. It starts with you.
Excelling at team meetings
Table 13-5 shows a structure for team meetings with a few hints and tips.
As if that’s not enough, try setting aside time for each team member monthly. 
Alongside your co-selling efforts, use that monthly time to:
	
✓	Review how team members are doing with their goals.
	
✓	Acknowledge achievements.
	
✓	Identify barriers and how to overcome them.
Drive your team’s performance and you drive sales growth.

Table 13-5	
Team Meetings and What They’re For
Meeting Type
Meeting Purpose
Weekly
No more than one 
hour.
A good time is 
Friday morning. It 
resets for the fol-
lowing weeks, but 
also enthuses the 
team to use Friday 
afternoon fully, 
which is a key 
selling time.
Agenda:
	 •	Review results (wins and losses).
	 •	Examine each opportunity and determine next actions.
	 •	Hold interventions with coaching/decisions to co-sell.
	 •	Ask for team members’ individual reports on progress 
with initiatives.
	 •	Plan specific actions for the next one or two weeks.
Don’t use weekly meetings to get into deep discussions 
about marketing plans, sales strategies or new partner 
initiatives. Reserve those for the monthly or quarterly 
meetings.
Monthly
Up to two hours.
Friday morning.
Agenda:
	 •	Review prior month’s results, for sales and for revenue
	 •	Cover progress with initiatives: marketing, sales and 
partners
	 •	Float ideas for new initiatives to be considered at the next 
Quarterly meeting (but limit initiatives to 1 or 2 in each 
functional area)
	 •	Review the sales process for minor adjustments, unless 
significant change is absolutely necessary
	 •	Do a Weekly sales meeting at the end of the Monthly 
meeting
Quarterly
Up to 4 hours.
Have lunch with 
the team as well if 
you can.
Agenda:
	 •	Quarterly results.
	 •	Sales process review and implementation of more signifi-
cant changes.
	 •	Strategic initiatives – in-depth review on progress and 
goal-setting/responsibility allocation for the next quarter.
	 •	New initiatives – review of new initiatives that you or the 
team are proposing. Decide whether to initiate, delay or 
scrap. If initiating, create goals (for example, case stud-
ies for top ten customers), timeline (within the next six 
months) and goal for the quarter (five new case studies 
this quarter and which customers). Also determine who’s 
leading and who’s contributing.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
Meeting Type
Meeting Purpose
Annual
One day or two 
half days – offsite 
is a great idea.
The annual meeting is an opportunity to roll-out a whole 
new game plan. You can split the meeting into two days: one 
for working on the plan, one for coming back and reviewing 
the final plan. At minimum, your meeting needs to include an 
annual plan, a review of annual initiatives (strategies) and 
an opportunity for a training session (sales refresh).
	
If your team is remote, your interactions are going to be a mix of online, on-
the-phone and face-to-face. Make sure that your later interactions include 
being together in the field, as well as at key meetings.
Supporting sales
Almost always, the best person to have involved at the later stage of a sales 
cycle with a prospect is . . . (drum roll) you! You may or may not be a trained 
salesperson, but you’re credible, knowledgeable, sometimes inspirational 
and you carry the natural authority of your title. Plus, if you’ve been trained 
in sales and are stepping up to leadership, you have some years of experi-
ence, are confident in your skin and skillful in negotiation. As you bring new 
team members into the sales process, you want to support them, not suffo-
cate them.
	
Avoid jumping in and doing the work for new members, even if you can do it 
better than they can. Instead do it with them, or better still coach them. To 
get expansion and growth, you need more people than just you able to make a 
sale.
Using the weekly sales meeting with the pipeline as a focus, you need to 
inspect the deals one by one to understand where they are in the sales pro-
cess. You can uncover essential detail, such as:
	
✓	Top deals: You can support these deals by co-selling with the person 
who’s taking the lead on selling to the prospect. Let that person lead the 
sale but start attending the meetings with the client and support your 
team member in getting to close. This situation is a win-win.
	
✓	Whether the deal is proceeding at a good pace or stalling: Examine 
stalled deals and determine whether they’re really stalled or just dead 
(such as when the customer is non-responsive to calls or weeks or 
months have passed since any activity).
	
✓	How each team member tackles or contributes to a sale: Match team 
members to the right opportunities based on their style. Co-sell with 
every team member at least two or three times a year.
Table 13-5 (continued)

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
259
 Chapter 13: Becoming the Leader of the (Sales) Pack
	
✓	Whether the sales process is stifling creativity: Let the team know that 
breaking the rules sometimes is okay. Being disruptive in a sales process 
can win you a deal you were bound to lose on paper. Have the team 
brainstorm ideas for stuck deals, an opportunity that has a unique twist 
or a deal from a customer in a vertical (industry) where you’ve never 
worked before.
	
✓	Whether you have ‘fluff’ in the pipeline: Like the stuff your tumble 
dryer produces – it blocks things up and if not cleared out can be dan-
gerous. Fluff includes deals with customers that don’t fit the profile (see 
Chapter 5) but the salesperson wants to hold on to. Be rigorous down-
grading or removing deals if you’re not satisfied that they’re ‘real’ or 
what your company should be pursuing.
Engaging in collaborative selling
Good teamwork in the sales meeting, as I discuss in the preceding section, 
pays off when you’re in the field, in the form of collaborative selling.
As well as co-selling with your salespeople, other team members may be 
involved in the sales, for example, subject matter experts or account/project 
managers. Selling complex services is a team game and each team member 
should have a specific role, not just be a warm body in the room.
	
When you roll-out your sales process, determine when and why other team 
members need to be brought in. Make sure that the person leading the sales is 
keeping others in the loop: the simplest way to do so is to invite the key sub-
ject matter experts and project managers to the weekly meeting. It alerts them 
to what they may have to get involved in and how they can support the sale, 
as well as prepares them for the sort of contacts they may have to deliver on.
	
A team may need a few practice runs to get comfortable with working together; 
having clear roles and responsibilities helps. Encourage debate, ideas and even 
mixing it up in terms of who works on what. If your project manager wants a 
shot at writing a proposal, that’s fine. Building a team with cross-functional 
skills is beneficial to business development and growth because you don’t 
want individuals being a bottleneck in the sales process, just because no one 
else can do what they do.
Avoiding knee-jerk reactions to problems
Mike Tyson said ‘Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face’ (and 
I’m not about to argue with him). When you feel the punch, though, you don’t 
abandon the plan wholesale. You get right back on it.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
Imagine that your ‘punch’ is that your sales pipeline is as sick as a sickly 
parrot. This reality happens to every business at some point – sales activity 
peaks and troughs based on factors outside your control, like the season or 
the economy, as well as on the strength of your team.
	
Keep historical copies of your pipelines and use them to compare periods, 
especially periods in prior years. You get a lot of insight into buying patterns 
and how to flex to shifting situations.
When you hit a troubled patch, don’t knee-jerk, abandon the process or start 
new, ill-considered initiatives. Hold steady.
Although you may be tempted to beat up the team when things are slow, ask 
yourself, ‘Do I need to panic now or later?’ I usually kick off my sales meetings 
with exactly that question. If things aren’t great, the team yell ‘Now!’ and then 
we proceed to work on what to do in the face of that situation. In Table 13-6, 
you can see a (somewhat over-simplified) analysis of when to panic now and 
when you can panic later.
I use the term ‘panic now’ tongue in cheek, of course. Having everybody run-
ning around yelling ‘Don’t panic! don’t panic!’ like a panicking sitcom charac-
ter isn’t going to solve a thin pipeline. Instead, I use the term to help people 
refocus the team’s efforts. You need to manage that shift and decide when to 
shift again, based on the impact of those changes.

Status:

Team to focus on qualified prospects 
to push them down the pipeline (to 
proposal or better). Some effort at 
qualifying leads efficiently. Also look 
for upsells to existing clients.
Focus: Good attention on deal closure, 
with leadership attention on those least 
likely to close (why not push the enve-
lope)? Mix this action with effort to 
grow the volume of new leads (longer-
term benefit), because the pipeline will 
look like the panic now situation soon 
enough. An opportunity to catch up on 
strategic initiatives.

A useful tool when you decide to shift attention in order to address a pipe-
line concern is a time management tool. You can download one at www.
salesbenchmarkindex.com/time-management-tool-sbi, although you 
need to modify it to the different roles in your team. Have your people fill it in 
for a month (and do so yourself, too). Don’t necessarily ask them to share it; 
rather, have them look at where they’ve spent their time and report back at 
the next monthly meeting. Did they feel they were shifting their focus in line 
with the ‘panic now’ plan? We’re they surprised how much or little time they 
spend in actual sales activities?
Above all, create a safe sales environment where team members can get 
advice, help and coaching and are willing to receive feedback and direction 
from those more experienced. If your offer is sound (in the sense I define it 
in the earlier ‘Getting clear what your business sells’ section) and the team’s 
clear that you’re committed to their success, your efforts should flourish.
	
A bad economy can tank a business and at such time cutting to the bare bones 
of business development is tempting. If at all possible, though, increase your 
investment in tough times, for two reasons: first, you need to try even harder 
in a tough economy; second, your competition is probably pulling back so 
take your chance to stand out. Good sales teams don’t let a bad economy 
stop them.
	
When the dot-com crash happened in 2002, Adam’s business went from nearly 
200 people to 18 – almost overnight. Talk about hanging on by your finger-
nails! So many firms were going under, but Adam was determined to hang on 
in there, whatever. He was fortunate to have some investment money stashed 
away, so he chose to invest in – business development. He brought in two 
highly experienced business developers, strong in sales and marketing, both 
of whom were about to get laid off from a firm similar to his. Within two years, 
he’d doubled his revenue while everyone was stagnating and his firm is still 
around today and has over 100 employees again.
Taking the right action at the right time
Your team knows what to do and when, guided by yourself as its leader and 
the sales process as its roadmap. Sales process aside, though, how do you, as 
a leader, know what to do when non-standard situations arise? Coping with 
such events is essential to successful business development and ensuring 
business growth because otherwise the team can get in the rut of ‘this is how 
we do it’. An occasional rogue response or process shake up is good for your 
sales team and your sales. Table 13-7 provides some leadership actions and 
shows when you can use them.

Table 13-7	
Leadership Actions and When To Use Them
Action
When To Use It
Tweak the process
The sales process needs a refresh from time to time:
	 •	 Review quarterly for general updates.
	 •	 Respond to new ideas and new channels as they 
become appropriate (for example, social media or 
new concepts about prospect nurturing).
	 •	 Update when new tools are added (for example, you 
can add an email marketing/marketing automation 
tool).
	 •	 Review after team changes. Use them as an oppor-
tunity to see whether shifting certain responsibilities 
can help productivity.
Intervene
When a specific sales pursuit seems not to be going 
well:
	 •	 Get feedback from the team.
	 •	 Add additional resources.
	 •	 Provide coaching (see later in this table).
	 •	 Co-sell with the team (assuming that the opportunity 
is worth your time).
	 •	 Suggest some outrageous tactic.
Redirect the team
When the pipeline is unbalanced, sales are low, revenue 
is at risk or you have a drop-dead date for a particular 
deliverable (see also earlier in this table):
	 •	 Shift the allocation of time to key stages in the sales 
process that need attention.
	 •	 Ask people to assist their team members if they’re 
overstretched.
Rebalance the 
investment
If your business goals change:
	 •	 Support new service offerings.
	 •	 Support new territories (geographic areas).
	 •	 Direct resources to marketing or the sales team as 
required by your strategy.

 Chapter 13: Becoming the Leader of the (Sales) Pack
Action
When To Use It
Coach
When team members need support:
	 •	 With a specific deal
	 •	 With less than satisfactory results
	 •	 When they don’t communicate sufficiently
	 •	 When a specific skill is missing (also consider training 
courses).
Redeploy
When team members are unable to fulfill on their role, 
but have been trying hard to do so:
	 •	 Consider them for an alternative position (for exam-
ple, salesperson becomes account manager).
	 •	 Retrain them for another role (consider a sales co-
ordinator, proposal writer or contract writer).
	 •	 Encourage them to seek another position, keeping 
them on until they do.
Discipline
When a team member has been coached but continues 
to underperform, lacks diligence or doesn’t behave in a 
professional manner:
	 •	 Document issues.
	 •	 Follow a rigorous disciplinary procedure (get HR 
advice).
Terminate
Replace the team member:
	 •	 Terminate for non-performance or other disciplinary 
issue.
	 •	 Eliminate the position (get HR advice).
Leadership can be a joy, a sorrow, a challenge and a tribulation – and never 
more so than when leading a sales team.
	
Of all the roles in an organization, salespeople who’re born to sell need posi-
tive strokes – reminders that they’re really great combined with something 
tangible as a bonus. Reward such people beyond commission – anything from 
a $50 (£31.50) gas card to a cruise. And if you sold the largest deal this quarter, 
reward yourself too.

Chapter 14
Taking the Lead: Selling 
Under Control
In This Chapter
▶	Putting customers to the test
▶	Presenting your firm’s services
H
 
ave you ever faced customers who, no matter how hard you try, keep 
disrupting the conversation, veering off into dead ends or being gener-
ally squirrely with you? The truth is that customers have the right to behave 
any way they want with you (at least until I ascend to power!), although if 
you’re highly skilled you’ll be able to handle the more slippery ones. In the 
end, however, customers are what they are, with all their concerns, fears 
and dreams. Just don’t live in la-la land and think that you’re going to change 
them. (Oh, to be president of la-la land – the people are so easy to please!)
Although I talk in this book about business development from the custom-
er’s viewpoint and encourage you to get inside your customer’s head (see 
Chapter 3), I don’t mean to imply that you have to be under the heel of cus-
tomers and that anything they say goes. No, you have to coach customers 
through the process, preferably on your timeline and not theirs. Plus, you 
can start training customers to be the way you want them to be. I know that 
sounds far-fetched – but it really is possible.
One of the myths around selling is that the customer is in control. Nonsense! You 
choose whether to do business with customers. They certainly have an opinion 
on the matter, but if you’re waiting for them to jilt you, you’re not in control.
In this chapter I describe how selling impacts the growth and health of your 
company; in other words, how you need to sell to get the right results in the 
short and longer term. I put you in the driver’s seat as I discuss two vitally 
important aspects of selling: qualifying leads (by which I mean how you deter-
mine that this is a prospect – a good fit for you and ready to buy) and how to 
pitch and present your services to that prospect.

This chapter isn’t a primer for salespeople. If you’re looking for that, pick up 
Tom Hopkins’s excellent Selling For Dummies (Wiley).
Okay, You’re In! Qualifying 
Leads into Prospects
	
A lead needs to be qualified to become a prospect, who in turn needs to buy 
to become a customer. So what do I mean by qualification?
The ancient Egyptians believed that when you died, you had to take a river jour-
ney across the Nile and meet Osiris. He had some nasty tests to see whether you 
were worthy to pass into the green and pleasant land of the underworld – such 
as weighing your heart against a feather to make sure that it was lighter.
You don’t have to cut out your customers’ hearts to see whether you want 
to work with them (darned health and safety rules!), but the idea’s the same. 
You’re the gatekeeper and prospective customers have to qualify to pass 
through to the part of the sales process (presenting and proposing) where 
you’re going to invest significant time with them. Gatekeeping has got to be 
worth your effort.
To be more precise, you’re in charge of several gates, not just one. Take a 
look at the sales process in Figure 13-1, or appraise your own process if you 
have one: you need to have criteria for every stage in the process, from pros-
pecting right through to contracting. Check out the section on ‘Gating your 
sales pipeline’ later in this chapter.
Ultimately, your ability to bring in the right customers with velocity drives 
your business growth. No wonder people confuse business development with 
sales! Selling well – not just anything to anyone, but to the customers who are 
the best fit, the most co-operative and the best payers – takes skill and assur-
ance. Put your power suit on – this is selling. In the next section I cover how 
to qualify leads effectively.
Getting your interactions 
right with customers
	
You get the clients you want only if you adhere to certain principles during 
qualification. Here are a few things to stick to like glue:

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
267
 Chapter 14: Taking the Lead: Selling Under Control
	
✓	Know what you’re going after: Use your customer definition/profile(s) 
to determine whether a company is even a target for you. I cover devel-
oping customer profiles in Chapter 5.
	
✓	Be in control of every interaction: When you take control, you can 
guide the process to go your way and get the information you need 
in order to decide whether to proceed. You discover how to do that 
throughout this chapter.
	
✓	Be prepared: Have qualifying tools and processes that keep you single-
minded about what your company needs.
	
✓	Be authoritative: Handle prospects so that they trust, respect and like you.
	
✓	Be mindful: During interactions with customers, you find out what 
they’re like. Some behave like jerks – they don’t respect your time, act 
as if they’re entitled, don’t give you what they promise and, at worst, are 
disrespectful. They aren’t going to change. Don’t work with them.
Technically, qualification begins when you first meet the customer. Your mar-
keting team should be bringing you marketing-qualified leads (MQLs – whizz 
to Chapter 9 for details). Marketing targets specific people in specific orga-
nizations that, at first blush, are a good fit for your offer; they weed out the 
ones that aren’t.
Well, that’s the theory. In practice, you may not have a marketing department 
and you may even be the only one prospecting, desperately trying to gener-
ate leads. Either way, use the gates from Figure 13-1 to decide whether a pros-
pect gets through to the next stage so that you get the customers you want.
	
Being in control doesn’t mean that you don’t care about customers and aren’t 
willing to see things from their viewpoints. But if they’re not good customers 
for you, better for them if you tell them quickly. Don’t waste time hoping that 
they’re going miraculously to become great customers.
Handling leads, whatever the source
Say that you have a new lead. Great! It can originate from a number of places 
and where it comes from is important, because this fact affects how valuable 
the lead is and the rules for how you handle it. You want to qualify the lead 
before you spend a whole bunch of time on it. You’re in the Qualify stage 
of the sales process (Figure 13-1) and the pre-requisite to enter the next 
stage (Present) is ‘Prospect passes qualification questions’. So that’s what 
qualification is all about – asking questions (which you design) to determine 
whether the lead is Qualified for further discussion.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
	
How much time you’re willing to spend on a lead depends somewhat on where 
it came from. Some are better than others. Here are some thoughts about how 
to handle the different sources of leads. Note that you need to adjust the HOT/
WARM/COOL based on your own experience, so my comments are somewhat 
personal, based on the many firms I’ve worked with:
	
✓	The ‘call out of nowhere’: Someone you’ve never spoken to before calls 
and wants to talk to the owner or to sales about your services. Call back 
right away! Not only do you find out how the person found you, but also 
the call’s a huge signal that this prospect is in the buying cycle. Status is 
HOT (like Studio 54 in the mid-1970s).
	
✓	MQL: You get a lead from marketing: someone just downloaded your 
white paper after attending your webinar last month. This lead is one for 
your next cold-calling session. MQLs are conversation openers and not 
sales-qualified leads. Best-case scenario: you find that the firm is a hot 
lead (it happens). More typically, after asking a few questions, you find 
that they’re still early stage and you should hand them back to market-
ing. You probably don’t have the time to nurture them for a few months. 
Status is COOL (but not the good, Humphrey Bogart kind – more like the 
IRS’s response to your request for more time to pay).
	
✓	Appointment: Someone has set up an appointment for you, perhaps 
the lead qualifier from marketing or a service you employ to get leads. 
Assuming the lead-generation people are working to specific criteria, 
make sure that you have all the information and put in a call to confirm 
the meeting. Status is WARM, (great for bread, less so for soup), but may 
turn out to be HOT or COLD.
	
✓	Met you already: For example, if someone had a good conversation 
with you at an event, make a speedy call before he forgets all about it. 
Like playing roulette, this act is hit or miss and no way of knowing what 
the outcome is going to be. Status is WARM/COOL (as in ‘the weather’s 
really too mild, but damn I look great in this suede jacket!’).
	
✓	Website contact-me form: A huge proportion of these responses aren’t 
going to be a fit, regardless of whether they’re ready to buy or not. 
Chances are they’re not, because unlike your proactive outbound activi-
ties (such as sending emails and attending carefully chosen events) 
they haven’t been vetted by your gating criteria and so can be anybody. 
Stick them in your next calling session. Status is that over 90 percent are 
probably VERY COOL/ALMOST COLD (the IRS’s response when you miss 
the second deadline too). You have to call them, though, because one in 
a hundred will be HOT.
	
✓	Referral: If it comes from a partner, the referral may well be a great 
fit: call right away. If it comes from a customer, it may be promising or 
some way off. You have to call referrals within a day, because you owe 
it to your customer/partner to respect their willingness to help. Status 
is HOT/WARM (like the options on your tumble dryer – just don’t shrink 
that jacket).

 Chapter 14: Taking the Lead: Selling Under Control
	
Whatever the source, at a minimum enter the people who fit your profile, but 
aren’t yet ready to buy, into your database so that your marketing campaigns 
can message them. If you find out that they are in the buying cycle, kick their 
tires then.
Determining who to sell to
You need to be selfish when deciding who to sell to. After all, if you’re active 
in sales, you have a quota, a goal for how much you have to sell this year. 
Whether you have a salesperson’s title or are fulfilling the role in a small busi-
ness, you’re on the hook to get sales. You also want to acquire really good 
customers for your company, not just any old customer.
	
Mostly, salespeople chase anything that moves in the hope that it turns into 
business. Given that you have only so many hours in the day, you want to use 
your time more wisely. The key to successful sales is to say ‘no’ as early as 
you can and focus your energy and attention on the customers you really want 
to close. You’re much more likely to win if you do.
When you start qualifying a lead, you need the profile you develop in Chapter 5 
and some qualification questions, plus a good questionnaire to make sure that 
you can define the extent (scope) of the work (see the next section).
Don’t ever talk to a lead/prospect without researching the company and the 
person first. You should already have the basic information from your lead 
source. Use LinkedIn, the prospect’s website and any other tools to find out 
more and assess whether the lead/prospect fits your profile.
Gathering the tools to help qualifying
You have two basic types of tools when qualifying: checklists and question-
naires for getting answers; and how you conduct the process. Together, these 
tools keep you in control and get what you need to move forward with the sale.
	
Here are a few things to have to hand:
	
✓	Agenda: Set the agenda for the call/meeting, so that it goes the way 
you want and to manage the time. I usually start with introductions and 
then suggest the agenda and get the customer representatives to agree 
that it’ll work. If they have any other items to add, make sure that you 
fit those in. I include a quick introduction to the company, qualification 
questions, a discussion on pricing (broad, but just to make sure that 
you’re not both wasting your time), scoping questions, action items for 
both parties and then next steps. Get customers to commit to a time by 
which they’ll send you any information you need.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
	
✓	Pitch script: Aim to position your company’s services and value in less 
than three minutes. The customer is probably not listening anyway, so 
make it punchy and fun, and put some personality into it – but get it 
done fast. Customers want to talk about themselves.
	
✓	Battlecard: On the off chance that the customer is listening, have your 
battlecard to hand so that you’re ready for any questions.
	
	A battlecard is typically a single sheet or poster with useful information 
you can refer to during a customer conversation. Figure 14-1 shows an 
example. Think of a battlecard as a salesperson’s ‘cheat sheet’. If you 
have more than one service, you may need additional battlecards.
	
✓	Qualification and scoping questions: The questions you ask are more 
important than what you say about yourself. Through your questions, 
you demonstrate that you know what you’re doing – the result is imme-
diate trust, at least as far your competence goes.
	
Figure 14-1: 
A sales 
battlecard.
	
Taking the meeting
When you have all your tools and have done all your research, the time’s 
right for a call or visit.
	
While you’re judging the customer, they’re of course judging you. If you show 
up as organized, more interested in them than in talking about your company, 
with lots of great questions and a clear finish to the meeting, you’re better 
than nine out of ten salespeople.

 Chapter 14: Taking the Lead: Selling Under Control
As a minimum, make sure that you cover the first four questions in Table 14-1 
during the first call.
Table 14-1	
Qualification Questions
What You Ask the Customer
Your Hidden Question
What’s the business issue you’re expe-
riencing that has us talking today?
Need: What’s their need and can we 
fulfill it?
Who in your company is driving this 
project? Whose problems would get 
solved? Who’s involved in making a 
decision?
Authority: Is this the decision-maker? 
Who’s going to influence the purchase?
Are you actively looking right now? 
What’s your timeframe to start working 
on the solution?
Timing: Is this an opportunity, or future 
potential?
Has budget been allocated? Who’ll 
sign off on the go-ahead?
Budget: Who holds the budget?
What staff do you have on your side to 
manage the work?
Is this project going to go smoothly?
What’s your endgame? What’s the final 
result you want to produce?
What are their conditions for satisfac-
tion at the end of the project and can 
we meet them?
Ideally, you want to have enough time to ask your scoping questions so that 
you have all or most of what you need to create a quote or proposal. That’s 
why you need a structured questionnaire, so that you don’t forget anything. 
You don’t want to work in a straightjacket, but you do want to be efficient.
In sales processes, most time is wasted when the question of budget or pric-
ing isn’t discussed early on. If you put a lot of effort into the proposal and 
you’re wildly out, you cost yourself time that you need for better-suited 
prospects.
	
During qualification, let customers know what your services cost, or give 
a range. Ask for their budget and if they don’t have one (they’re fishing for 
proposals so that they know what to budget), give them your pricing. I ask 
whether they’re still on their chair. (Yes, I really do.) They laugh and then 
they tell me what they were actually thinking: from ‘That’s roughly what we 
thought’ to ‘We definitely can’t afford that.’ If the gap is small, you have the 
potential to show value that justifies your cost. The point is that you can back 
out gracefully early on if you need to.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
In some situations you can’t share costs or budgets early on, such as formal 
requests for proposals (RFPs). In those highly regulated selling situations, for 
example in the public sector, you just have to follow the rules.
Some obvious qualifiers apply, such as the customer needing what you offer 
and having the money, but don’t make the mistake of thinking that the sales 
process is all about getting as many customers as you can. Look back at prior 
sales and identify ones that seemed like a reasonable fit but turned out to be 
a nightmare. This mismatch can happen for lots of reasons, but you should 
try to avoid it, or at least have your eyes wide open.
	
Assuming that you’ve scoped the work accurately and the budget is fair, while 
talking with a customer keep in mind a list of warning signs that the project 
may go south. I think of it as the waste eliminator. If you’re going to work with 
customers who aren’t quite a fit for your profile or show early signs of being 
unco-operative, that’s your choice, but the consequences can be destructive – 
delayed timeline, loss of profit, late payments or challenges to your invoices, 
unhappy employees, cancelled contracts.
The precise list depends on you, but I include a few suggestions in Table 14-2.
Table 14-2	
Should You Sell or Should You Not?
If Customers . . . 
Yes/No
Keep their appointments and send you the material they promised
✔
Don’t let you get a word in edgewise, and want to dominate the 
conversation
✘
Don’t do what they said they would
✘
Are disrespectful to any of your team
✘
Take your guidance, are appreciative of your expertise and keep to 
their planned buying schedule (or pretty close)
✔
	
How customers behave in the buying process is how they’ll be when you work 
with them. Leopards don’t change their spots. However, you can train custom-
ers to conform to your requirements – for example, during the sales process, 
if they promise something by Friday (say a decision), remind them Thursday 
that you’re expecting to hear from them. If by Monday, nothing has happened, 
let them know that unless you hear from them by the end of the day, you’re 
assuming that they’re not interested and you’ll be moving on. If you don’t hear 
from them, you can guarantee that you wouldn’t have won the deal anyway. 
Get going with the next lead.

 Chapter 14: Taking the Lead: Selling Under Control
Gating prospects through 
your sales pipeline
When you’re working with a prospect and progressing using your own ver-
sion of the sales process (in other words, qualifying), you need some rules 
for moving prospects from one stage to the next, what I call gating. Here I 
discuss why gating is important and what rules you need to set. Figure 13-1’s 
illustration of an outline sales process includes the concept of gating.
Young companies tend to be pretty informal about managing their sales efforts. 
I’ve seen sticky notes around owner’s desks, no tool for capturing information 
about the prospect and no reporting to help prioritize what to do next.
	
When your company starts growing, you need more and more sales to achieve 
revenue growth from one year to the next. The time for informality is over. 
Here’s why:
	
✓	You need to provide status on the pipeline to others in the organization: 
you need to see whether you’re on track with the goals and they need to 
be planning for the projects that are likely to come in.
	
✓	Tracking where each prospect is in the process and noting next steps 
helps you manage your workload and prioritize the right actions.
	
✓	Adding new information about the prospect and the opportunity is 
highly valuable to you in the sales process and helpful to delivery. 
During the sales process and when you’re handing over to delivery, you 
need solid information to make the transition flawless.
	
✓	You need a consistent approach if you add more salespeople, because 
you have to aggregate data for good reporting. Make that process easy 
by using a good tool (sales force automation or customer relationship 
management tools – SFA/CRM). Chapter 13 covers choosing such tools.
So how do you create and use the gating criteria for your pipeline?
	
✓	The criteria, which should be a version of Figure 13-1, tell you what test 
a prospect has to pass before it can enter the next stage in the pipeline. 
Think of it as a sanity check against excessive optimism!
	
✓	As well as basic qualification criteria, which tell you when a prospect is 
ready to move to the next stage, you also need to consider whether you 
should proceed with it at every stage. You want to spend your time with 
promising companies that you’re likely to convert to customers. The 
preceding section gives you some ideas, and you can also mandate some 
actions by the customer that have the sales process moving like a hare, 
not like a tortoise.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
	
	For example, you may want to ensure that the decision-maker is going to 
be at the meeting where you present your proposal, as a condition for 
putting the effort into the proposal. What you choose to enforce is your 
choice and is going to be based on the nature of your business.
	
✓	Agree the probability percentage (likelihood that you’ll close this deal) 
to assign to each stage. Most SFA tools let you adjust the percentage to 
fit what works for you. The percentage probability allows you to weight 
the potential revenue so you can get a rough estimate of actual revenue 
going forward. (See Chapter 6 for a model spreadsheet.)
The ultimate test of whether your gating is well-designed is whether you 
reach the sales goals you want. If your gates and probabilities are con-
structed well, your forecast of revenue holds up in practice. If it doesn’t, 
gating is an area you need to take another look at.
	
In some cases, you may need to break your own rules. Say the job is smaller 
than you’d usually take, but the company is well-known and you want to add 
it to your customer list. Bigger projects may follow. You may well choose to 
move ahead – I would!
If your gut tells you, at the end of the qualification call, to move ahead, follow 
through and schedule the presentation. Find out who else will be in that 
meeting and get their names and roles – you’re going to need them.
Pitching Your Services to Customers
From a simple meeting with one person in the prospect company, to a full-on 
team presentation to a large roomful of people (yelp!), pitching takes many 
forms. It may involve just one meeting or several. The prospect may prede-
termine the format or you may be able to mold it to your preference.
For salespeople, pitching is like herding cats into an orchestrated show 
where the audience are potentially feral. You need a script, rehearsals and 
then – the actual performance. And you need and want the audience to chip 
in, but you can’t necessarily predict how the people are going to behave. Or 
can you?
Here I delve into the customer’s mindset, help you prepare effectively and 
guide you through performing on the day and analysing afterwards. I hope 
this section sells you on the value of aiming for pitching perfection.

 Chapter 14: Taking the Lead: Selling Under Control
What prospects want: Understanding 
customer mentality
In this section I present some pointers to bear in mind that help you under-
stand your customers’ concerns, even though you haven’t met some of the 
people you’re pitching to and don’t yet know them.
Selling to different roles
The members of a group you encounter in a presentation meeting represent 
specific departments and have responsibilities relating to a specific busi-
ness function (unless the firm’s small, in which case several functions can be 
rolled into one person).
	
Imagine that someone’s coming to sell your company something – say a new 
accounting system to replace that free or cheap bookkeeping software you’re 
using today. Think about what you’d care about. Would you be committed, 
interested, sceptical, indifferent, hostile? What about your colleagues? You can 
probably see that you’re not all in the same place. Translate that to your pros-
pects, because that’s what you’re selling into.
In a pitch situation, you typically meet all sorts of people: organization leaders, 
finance folks, HR, operations, legal, marketing or sales, admin. You’re dealing 
with several people at once, so while you’re trying to wow the CEO with your 
vision, you’re also trying to reassure the CFO that the risk is low and that costs 
will be reduced (or whatever your value is). Phew, that’s some juggling act.
The concerns of all these people are quite different and you need to be able 
to handle them and to answer all their questions. Table 14-3 helps you cover 
your bases.

 Chapter 14: Taking the Lead: Selling Under Control
Bear in mind that your target customers may not look quite like those in the 
table – simply apply the concept to your own situation. Each person is deal-
ing with the now (surviving today), looking to the future (sometimes ignoring 
the practicalities) or looking at the past (for reasons why this arrangement 
won’t work). All concerns are valuable to an organization: you just need to 
figure out how to handle them and what will get them to give the ‘thumbs up’ 
to your proposal.
	
These people don’t care about your service (well not much). Perhaps one or 
two people are committed to fulfilling the need, in that the idea is their brain-
child, but the rest are hearing your pitch to be informed, or more likely to 
judge why your solution won’t work. I’m not a pessimist, but if you take this 
viewpoint, you’re ready for that nasty question that can spike the presentation 
and rob you of all the good work you’ve done up till now. When you remember 
that they don’t care about you or your solution, you ensure that you deal with 
reality, and not with what you hope they’re thinking.
Addressing the concerns of individuals seems like a blindingly obvious tactic, 
but surprisingly most presentations and proposals don’t account for answer-
ing the questions of the diverse audience. Therefore, ensure that you know 
who’s attending so that you can map your presentation to their roles.
	
Roles are generic and people are unique. If the CEO you’re about to meet was 
an operations person earlier in his career, bear that in mind. He’s likely to 
be more now-based than future-based. People may change a little over their 
careers, but at their core they remain the same.
Selling to committees
Often, prospects assemble a committee to manage big purchases or are 
involved as a steering group throughout the project.
	
In effect, selling to committees is a special case of ‘selling to different roles’. 
Everything in the preceding section applies, plus:
	
✓	Committees are weird. They’ve a pecking order, they play internal 
politics and sometimes lack focus on the task at hand (that is, they’ve 
hidden agendas). Enjoy!
	
✓	Some committee members may have little or no knowledge about 
your area of service. This situation is common with the boards of com-
mercial and public organizations. You have to keep things simple and 
clear. They’re not idiots – they just need you to help them understand 
the need and value and why they should choose you.
	
✓	When the committee can meet may control the timeframe. This factor 
can slow down the sales process.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
	
✓	Committees can be risk averse and need lots of evidence that your offer 
is a safe bet. Most of the committee don’t want to be responsible for the 
ultimate decision. You need to convince the influencers (who want the 
solution) and whoever holds the money; the rest will probably follow.
	
The more you deal with groups, the more likely you are to be facing ‘avoid 
risk’ rather than carpe diem (seize the day!)
Selling against risk
Talking about risk upfront with your primary contacts is a good idea. The 
chances are that they’re advocates for the project, maybe even for you. They 
may even be slightly frustrated if a committee’s involved: all they want to do 
is get on with it.
Understanding the primary contact’s risk concerns helps you to counter 
them (see Table 14-4).
Table 14-4	
Risk Factors that Impact Prospects
Risk Factor
How to Counter
Career
If your prospect’s career would be threatened if you fail, 
educate the person on the process, benefits, case studies. 
Introduce him to the team he’ll be working with. Invite him to 
your office or do a Google Hangout. Get to know the person 
and build trust that you can make the prospect a hero.
Resources and 
Timing/Timeline
Does the contact have the right people and the time for this? 
Meet the person, assess how knowledgeable he is and find 
out what else he has on his plate. Explain your approach 
and how you can support him throughout. Be realistic about 
what he’d have to do and when. Be straight about any ‘drop-
dead’ date and whether that date is realistic.
Budget
Contacts are up against a tight budget with no wiggle room. 
Discuss the scope. Maybe you can delay some of the work 
until next year, making the project less risky overall.
Opposition
Prospects always have alternatives to you – such as doing 
it themselves or using the CEO’s son, who’s a kick-ass at 
something or other. Your contact may not be willing to fight 
for you. If so, go rogue. If you sense that your contact isn’t 
supporting you, go over his head. Ask your CEO to call his 
CEO and say how pleased he is to be in business conversa-
tions with the prospect. If you’re the CEO, maybe someone 
in your network knows someone in the prospect and can 
make a side call. Get creative.

 Chapter 14: Taking the Lead: Selling Under Control
Rarely do you (or indeed does anyone) have services to offer that precisely 
fit the customer’s situation, and so a slam dunk is unlikely. In contrast, sales 
are often lost to the ‘do nothing’ option. Not acting is much easier for pros-
pects, and risk is a great excuse for choosing inaction. Make sure that your 
value proposition is crystal clear and that you spell out the benefits, prefer-
ably as ROI.
Contacts don’t get fired for hiring IBM. In large companies, complexity is high 
and decision-makers go for the most trusted, dependable vendor. If your firm 
becomes the best at a specific service, you can be low risk too; maybe not 
quite IBM, but getting there.
	
During the sales process, talk about the risks and how you’ll handle them 
during the work. Build mitigation for the risks into your plan for the job. 
Chapter 16 has more on this subject.
Limbering up to pitch
I assume that after you complete qualification (see the earlier section ‘Okay, 
You’re In! Qualifying Leads into Prospects’), you typically create a quote or 
proposal and present it to the prospect. In a competitive situation, you need 
to show up as the best to win: best at selling, best in specialized knowledge, 
best at doing these kinds of projects.
	
Prospects buy from people. If the prospect refuses to meet with you (‘just 
email me your quote’), walk away. Don’t bend to everything that prospects 
want – if they expect free work upfront, explain why you don’t do that. (You 
don’t, do you? If so, stop it!)
	
Focus your efforts on the customers that you want to win. Proposing and 
pitching well takes a lot of effort so make sure that you:
	
✓	Focus on the prospect’s need/pain, not on yourself.
	
✓	Customize your presentation/proposal to the customer, instead of 
making it generic and talking too much.
	
✓	Share the budget before the pitch, to avoid ‘sticker shock’.
	
✓	Get ready for the tough questions the prospect is going to ask. Don’t shy 
away from the problematic, simply hoping that everything goes okay.
	
✓	Prepare fully for the meeting and don’t look disorganized.
	
✓	Manage the time on the day.
	
✓	Stick to your guns about how the project needs to be done, instead of 
letting the customer’s opinions sway you from what you know is the 
right way.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
	
The better you can follow these strong practices, the more in control you are. 
To do the preparation well:
	
✓	Try to negotiate the agenda (see the earlier section ‘Gathering the tools 
to help qualifying’) with the prospect. The more formal the process and 
the more competitive the bid, the more likely the contact is to tell you 
what he wants to see in the pitch. If you need flexibility to do the meeting 
differently, ask for it and say why.
	
✓	Choose who’s going with you. Get that person’s ideas for the proposal 
and pitch.
	
✓	Profile who’s going to be present from the prospect’s side. Check 
these people out on LinkedIn. Make sure that your whole team is in the 
know and allocate team members to take care of specific contacts within 
the prospect firm.
	
✓	Create a pitch presentation that demonstrates how your service meets 
the prospect’s needs (specifically). It also needs to present the value 
from the point of view of each influencer/decision-maker. Don’t forget 
that some people won’t have met you or even know what you do.
	
✓	List all the questions that you don’t want the prospect to ask and get 
the answers prepared. Decide who on your team is going to answer 
each one. Prepare some tough questions to ask the prospect as well.
	
✓	Prepare your proposal. See the sidebar ‘Writing good proposals’ and 
figure out how you’re going to pitch it.
	
✓	Rehearse your presentation. Decide on a master of ceremonies and who 
talks about what. Allocate time to each section. The MC is in charge of 
moving things along and ensuring that action items get noted at the end.
	
✓	Consider ‘leave-behinds’. What can you leave with the prospect: for 
example, copies of your proposal and presentation, examples of work?
	
You don’t have to go in armed with PowerPoint presentations if that’s not your 
style. Your presentation can be entirely verbal with the right props to keep the 
show going. Mostly, after listening to you for a short while, prospects want to 
talk about themselves, so plan sufficient time for discussion and questions, 
with some to spare.
Writing good proposals
Proposals and quotes for services work come in all shapes and sizes. Some 
are gargantuan, hundreds of pages long. Some are two pages with a ‘sign 
here’ at the bottom. You have to determine what’s right for you. But unless

281
 Chapter 14: Taking the Lead: Selling Under Control
your service is simple and quickly delivered, or you work for an hourly fee 
and do whatever the customer asks, you usually write proposals that are 
separate from a legal contract and can be revised after an initial presentation.
Following useful principles
Whatever the situation, follow best practice. At a minimum, your proposal 
needs to lay out the customer’s need/problem clearly and what you’re going 
to do to solve it, the deliverables, the assumptions you’re making and the 
timeline and cost. If your proposal is long, create an executive summary (a 
one-page synopsis of the content of a proposal, including the pricing).
You may want to include other information with your proposal, but the best 
proposals keep it short and to the point and provide additional information 
(marketing materials, methodology, further explanation/education) sepa-
rately, or as appendices.
Above all, you want to make it easy for the customer to say ‘yes’. Consider 
giving options for level of service (where you want them to buy the middle 
one). Make the top one look like a Cadillac – expensive, lots of bells and 
whistles, and a bit of overkill for the customer’s situation. Make the bottom 
one the down-and-dirty version – low cost, ‘we guide you, you do the work’, 
no wiggle room. The middle one is what the customer needs and what you 
want to sell.
As an alternative, give the company a core option and then a menu of all the 
extras it can add. Make sure that those options are distinct and not depen-
dent on each other (or package them in groups).
Being personal
Although you may have a boatload of boilerplate text lying around, make your 
proposals personal. Write as if you’re in a conversation. For example, have a 
letter to the buyer as the first page, summarizing what the proposal is all about. 
Use the prospect’s company name throughout. Talk specifically about its scope, 
feedback and timing. Avoid long pages with nothing about the prospect.
Responding to requests for proposals (RFPs)
RFPs, whether public sector or commercial, are far more rigid in their require-
ments. This situation is where your boilerplate comes in handy. Read the 
RFP cover to cover and make an early decision as to whether you’re going 
to respond. If you can ask questions, do so in minute detail (you normally 
submit them by email or online). You must follow the procedure and the pro-
posal requirements meticulously, otherwise your bid can be eliminated. Often 
the response format is strict, so you have to adapt your boilerplate to their 
requirements.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
You may not even get a chance to meet the selection team: if not, I recom-
mend that you don’t bid – remember that people buy from and sell to people 
and you may not like them! In the case of RFPs, don’t offer options unless 
asked to. You have to propose and price exactly what the customer is asking 
for – even if you don’t agree. Get yourself to the shortlist and then you start 
the discussion about better ways of solving the problem. If you provide 
options in the response, they can’t evaluate apples to apples against others 
and you won’t make the shortlist.
‘Let’s dance’: Pitching  
on the day
Celebrate! You made it to the pitch, and so you have the possibility of a win. 
Now you need to manage what happens on the day. Obviously, ensure that 
you arrive a little early and have enough time to set up.
	
Make one person responsible for setting up the presentation if you’re doing 
one (projector, hand-outs and so on), while other team members connect with 
your primary contact or other people who may come into the room early. 
The ten minutes before the meeting kicks off are precious – use them to get to 
know the people. If you did your research, you have something to say to each 
one. You need them to like you before they’ll buy, so work on that first.
You’re about to go into a delicate dance. You want to manage the situation 
and have the prospect delighted. You need to get your information across 
and answer all questions. You need to be respectful and polite and train the 
customer for what working with you will be like.
	
If you or your team get nervous in presentations, remember that you’re look-
ing to ‘buy’ the customer, and be on the lookout for whether the company’s 
a good fit for you. Ask your folks to focus on evaluating the customer – it 
distracts them (while they’re not speaking) into doing something useful and 
improves their listening. Otherwise, they’re just in their own heads rehearsing 
what to say when their time comes.
	
Here are a selection of simple ‘dos’ for pitching well:
	
✓	Start with introductions: You want to put names and roles to faces. Ask 
people to state their biggest concern about the project – you may get 
‘Nothing really, I’m just here to listen’ or you may hear some specific items 
you need to cover quickly. Don’t introduce your team members – let them 
do it for themselves. It gets them talking. Keep introductions short.

283
 Chapter 14: Taking the Lead: Selling Under Control
	
✓	Invite the prospect’s representatives to interrupt you and ask ques-
tions: The more they talk, the better. Just tell them if you want to 
address their question later.
	
✓	Be clear: Don’t waffle and don’t over-complicate. Customers want 
things to be easy, so make understanding how you can help them 
straightforward.
	
✓	Repeat any questions you’re asked by the customer, but in your own 
words: Doing so ensures that you’re answering what the person’s really 
asking and gives you time to think about your answer.
	
✓	Ask them questions: Tough ones are really good – they give you breath-
ing space and test the cohesion of the prospect’s team. These questions 
often uncover whether they’re in any disharmony. Be ready for how 
you’re going to deal with their different viewpoints.
	
✓	Listen carefully and take notes: Ask about anything you’re unclear on.
	
✓	Talk about what working with you is like: Explain how the project gets 
started, what happens along the way, how it wraps up and what happens 
afterwards. You’re creating a future of working with you for them to step 
into. Make it personal, for example: ‘Sunitha will help you organize the 
kick-off meeting. Jeff, she’d be working with you on that, right?’
	
✓	Be ready to talk budget and make sure that your numbers hold 
water: If they ask, say that you’re willing to negotiate dependent on a 
deeper discussion about the scope. The presentation isn’t the time for 
negotiation.
	
✓	Capture action items for both parties and note next steps: Be clear 
about the person or people to contact and when you can expect to hear 
from them.
	
Some people like to end a presentation meeting with a few ‘trial closing’ 
questions, namely, testing whether the prospect is leaning in your direction. 
Typical questions are: ‘Does what we presented meet your immediate needs?’; 
‘Aside from the final details, are you ready to move forward with us?’; ‘Are you 
speaking to any other vendors?’; ‘If all were equal, would you go with us?’ Use 
questions like these ones where you think appropriate.
The end of a pitch is as important as the beginning. Are the prospects staying 
behind, talking to you? If they’re running out the door, try to discern whether 
they just have another meeting or are turned off. You need to look for your 
allies and spend time with them.
Don’t forget to debrief with your team. Let them vent everything they have to 
say and then gather feedback about what worked and what didn’t. After all, 
you’ll be going through this process again and again.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
The inquest: Assessing how the pitch went
Follow up with the prospect to confirm action points and when you’re going 
to hear from the company. Do so with a call and confirm in an email.
	
The time from the pitch to the decision is a dangerous one and lots of oppor-
tunities ‘go dark’ at this stage. Why is that? Unfortunately, most of the reasons 
why buyers go off the radar are related to issues that needed taking care of 
earlier in the sales process:
	
✓	You didn’t align with the prospect: Perhaps the company’s pain wasn’t 
big enough or you were unable to sell it on the larger (negative) implica-
tions of choosing a ‘do-it-ourselves’ approach or doing nothing.
	
✓	You didn’t get to all the people who mattered: You need to insist on 
interacting with all stakeholders so that you can answer individual ques-
tions and counter any objections.
	
✓	You were too focused on yourself and not enough on the customer: 
Remember that firms don’t have to do business with you. They’ll prob-
ably survive anyway.
Use your personas (descriptions of roles within the customer company) and 
the customer journey to take care of these issues next time.
You have to deal with the specter of ‘do nothing’, which is the most common 
reason why buyers never buy – at least not this year. Your responsibility is to 
push the case for urgency – the danger to the prospect of not buying needs 
to be bigger than that of buying.

A
 
fter you’ve worked so hard qualifying a lead and pitching to a prospect 
(as I describe in Chapter 14), getting the call that a customer has selected 
your company is the high point of the relationship so far. Everyone likes to be 
wanted and this customer wants you. Well done! You’re about to increase your 
revenue and contribute to your company’s growth.
You’re now in the final stages of closing this deal and getting ready to start 
the work. Typically 95 per cent or more of verbal acceptances close, but you 
still face a short journey before you get ink onto paper, a journey I lead you 
through in this chapter.
After the contract is signed, you then have to negotiate a delicate transition 
between the sales and delivery departments to set the project on the path to 
success and take onboard any lessons along the way. Therefore, I also help 
you answer questions such as: ‘How can sales help the delivery team be suc-
cessful with the customer?’ and ‘What steps are necessary to make sure that 
you learn everything you can from the sale cycle, win or lose?’
‘Signed, Sealed, Delivered’: 
Closing the Deal
A solid business requires solid contracts, because the success of your busi-
ness depends on profitable work and a well-crafted and negotiated contract 
is a major contribution to doing work that pays.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
Sometimes, you give prospects a contract and they sign meekly, like lambs. 
More often, though, they have questions or changes. This section helps you 
negotiate powerfully and get the contract signed.
Picking your way through negotiation
	
When you get a verbal acceptance from the customer, you’re entering a period 
of negotiation that ends when the contract is executed, namely signed by both 
parties.
But before you go into negotiation, you need to establish a few rules to abide 
by while the to-and-fro with the customer is going on. In the end, rules are 
made to be broken, but for every situation you need to bear in mind the deal-
breakers that you must avoid.
Immediately after a verbal ‘We want to work with you’, the customer may 
start changing things around – or it may wait until a contract’s on the table. 
Be ready in advance. What are your rules? What do you expect: for example, 
is payment to be online and are deadlines going to be adhered to?
	
Here are two common areas in which customers sometimes negotiate after a 
verbal agreement, plus my suggestions for how you can best respond:
	
✓	Scope: If scope (that is, the description of the work that you’re going to 
do – see Chapter 14) is increasing, so must price. If scope is decreasing, 
make sure that it doesn’t compromise the quality of the work or go so 
low that the deal is no longer worthwhile.
	
✓	Price: If customers want a lower price (for some reason they never seek 
higher ones!), you can negotiate by agreement with your team as long as 
you ask for a concession (say, better payments terms or direct deposit).
If customers want to talk about scope and price, try to have those conversa-
tions and come to an agreement before the contract is prepared.
	
You can still say ‘no’. If customers really want to work with you, by which I 
mean that they don’t have a second choice waiting in the wings, they often let 
you have your way if you stick to your guns.
Getting to the real ‘yes’ without begging
If ever you need to be in control during the sales process, this is it. You’re 
moving towards a contract and you have to bear in mind a few crucial things 
for this phase of the relationship. Think of this stage as a pre-nuptial agree-
ment. Although you’re both excited to be getting on with things, the legal 
stuff has to be processed before you can walk up the aisle.

287
 Chapter 15: Closing the Sale to Your Satisfaction
	
Here are a number of tips for handling this period of the relationship:
	
✓	Tell the customer that this point is going to be the low one in the rela-
tionship, but that you’ll both get through it and things will improve 
afterwards. It may seem direct, but straight talk gets you respected. 
Customers prefer it.
	
✓	Find out quickly whether the customer wants to give you its contract or 
is going to accept yours. Ideally, you want to use your contract format, 
but you may have to deal with the customer’s. The larger your custom-
ers, the more likely they are to insist on their contract and you may not 
like what it contains. If they ‘don’t mind’, go for yours – much easier. 
I explain more on contract details in the next section.
	
✓	Don’t lose your nerve – you don’t want to appear desperate. After all, 
the customer wants this deal as much as you do.
	
✓	Conduct the conversations in the same way as you did in earlier stages 
of the sales cycle (see Chapter 14). In other words, continue to ‘train’ 
the customer in how you want things to go. Schedule times to discuss 
key matters at hand, confirm action items at the end of the meeting and 
set deadlines for when those action items need to be accomplished.
	
✓	Don’t hesitate to blame your legal advisors for how long everything is 
taking – they get paid lots and can take it.
A salesperson should be competent to handle most of the questions that 
come up during negotiation, but for certain items you need to consult or 
escalate, internally or with legal advisors. Both parties need to be comfort-
able with compromises, so don’t be shy of asking for something in return if a 
customer wants to change the agreement.
	
Don’t drop to your knees and beg for the work, no matter how much you need 
it. Also, don’t use tactics such as ‘if we don’t start next week, we may not be 
able to fit you in until the month after next’ (unless that’s true, of course). The 
customer can see through any such white lies. They undermine the relation-
ship, because now the customer can’t trust what you say, and that impacts 
everything that happens while the work is being done.
Instead, be confident and authoritative – know your boundaries and what 
you’re willing to accept. Be prepared to walk away with your head held high if 
you have to.
Contracting for a win-win
	
Get a lawyer, unless your service is simple and you can capture a contractual 
agreement on two to three pages. You can obtain plenty of good templates for 
contracts at low cost (from sites such as www.legalcontracts.com and 
www.ebook777.com

288
Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
www.contractstore.com), but if you’re not experienced with the legal 
implications, you can find yourself in dangerous territory.
In fairness, only rarely in services do parties have to go to court to resolve 
issues that occur during or after the work, but it does happen and it can take 
your business down. Services are usually a bit more flexible than products 
and this point is where a good lawyer, preferably one who’s familiar with 
your type of work, helps you build a watertight contract, or to deal with one 
coming from the customer. Typically service contracts have a main agree-
ment (Master or Services Agreement) and then a Statement of Work (what’s 
actually going to be done). This format works especially well where you’ll be 
doing more than one job for the client, or any follow-on work.
Considering contract details
	
A standard contract has clear terms and conditions (Ts and Cs) that need to 
cover some of or all the following:
	
✓	A general description of the services you do (fully described in a 
Statement of Work)
	
✓	Change orders – a document added to the contract later to cover scope 
changes, and what the format for that document will be
	
✓	Payment terms
	
✓	Confidentiality agreements
	
✓	Ownership of the work – in certain circumstances you may want to 
retain ownership for reuse
	
✓	Warranties for the work
	
✓	Advertising and marketing – whether you can tell people about the cus-
tomer and the work
	
✓	Non-solicitation of employees – the customer can’t hire your people 
without a penalty
	
✓	Indemnification – setting boundaries that define what people can sue 
you for
	
✓	Under what circumstance each party can terminate the contract
	
✓	Arbitration – detailing the conditions for reaching agreement without 
going to court
	
✓	Other terms covering rare but important eventualities, such as mergers 
and takeovers, acts of God and the like
Now you know why you need a lawyer!

You need liability insurance. You can choose specific types of insurance for ser-
vices companies, so make sure that you’re well covered. I’ve had friends who 
found themselves in a litigation situation where insurance saved their bacon.
Handling potential deal-breakers
When you have a good format for a Master Agreement and a Statement of 
Work, you should only need to consult your lawyer if the customer disagrees 
with a material item, namely something you can’t just step over because 
doing so is too risky for you. I’ve only experienced a handful of such situa-
tions in my career.
Material items aren’t the only potential deal-breakers. Sometimes the customer 
pushes you on areas that you really don’t want to give way on. Table 15-1 
covers some of the most common ones, whether they’re deal-breakers and 
how to handle them.

Deal-breaker?
Liability or

Beyond regular liability insurance, 
if the customer tries to make you 
responsible for loss of business, 
or anything you have no control 
over, push back. Get your lawyer 
involved.
Yes
Payment terms
If the customer wants terms longer 
than (say) 30 days, resist or request 
an upfront payment of some size to 
cushion the blow.
Maybe
Cancellation
Make sure that all terms for can-
cellation are fair – you should be 
able to cancel if the customer 
takes way too long to do its side 
of the work or is repeatedly late in 
paying.
Maybe
Pricing or scope
If these topics weren’t agreed 
earlier, that’s a mistake. You’re late 
in the day to be sorting them out 
now. Clarifying deliverables in the 
Statement of Work is okay.

Sometimes, contract negotiations start to go south. If it looks like you’re 
ready to punch each other’s lights out, have the CEOs talk, or anyone who can 
get you out of the impasse. Bringing in senior people who aren’t emotional or 
angry is a great approach. Keep this tactic as your last and final measure, but 
I find that if the top people talk, they usually reach an agreement that every-
one can live with. Never underestimate the power of escalation.
When the customer signs, celebrate! Somehow, I think you’ll remember 
that tip.
	
Contracts are a difficult area to practice, but two aspects do allow you to try 
something with the help of others. First, you can get the opinion of your busi-
ness mentor/advisor on contracting. Even if the person is in a different busi-
ness, some principles are universal. Second, work with your sales team on 
the issues that you will and won’t give way on during negotiation. The earlier 
Table 15-1 is a good starting point and you want everyone in your team on the 
same page, to avoid any rogue contract change slipping through and biting 
you in the rear-end later.
‘This Much I Know’: Managing the 
Transition from Sales to Delivery
After a contract is signed, you need to take care of important business called 
handover to delivery.
Often the people who’re going to deliver the work aren’t all that involved in 
the sales process, if at all. Therefore, you have a lot of valuable information 
in your head that you need to get over to the delivery folks. You’re part of a 
team and you can’t leave the playing field yet.
During the sales process, you’ve had a number of meetings with the cus-
tomer. Beyond the obvious (scoping the work and creating a proposal – see 
Chapter 14 – and surviving contract negotiations as I describe earlier in 
‘Picking your way through negotiation’), you have a lot more to offer the 
delivery team in terms of useful information.
	
You can’t just throw the contract over the wall to delivery and hope things go 
well. A lot of services projects falter right at the beginning if handover is 
skimped. Don’t do it.
In this section I help you think about how long you should stay involved, 
when to pull out and when you may want to step back in again. Bear in mind 
that delivery wants to get started and you want to be helpful, but without 
cramping its style.

Staying on the team
	
Be there to support the team during the transition. Your presence also gives 
the customer representatives comfort that the person they know best in your 
organization is still around while they get acquainted with new people.
Although you want to hang around for a while, you also don’t want to outstay 
your welcome:
	
✓	You’re not a delivery person (unless you’re one of those unfortunate 
people who has to sell and deliver) and you don’t want to interfere with 
delivery. Let delivery do its job. Don’t be looking over its shoulder all 
the time.
	
✓	You have to get back to your other important work – closing the next 
deal, finding the next opportunity. Hanging out with new customers can 
be comfortable and sometimes that’s valuable. But you’re not in busi-
ness to be comfortable.
You can be a great help at this time. Don’t become a hindrance.
Passing on all you know
Some of the knowledge that you need to communicate to the delivery team is 
contained in documents (such as proposals and contracts), some is in notes 
and some is in your head. Time to turf it all out, so prepare to share:
	
✓	Background to the customer’s business: what it does, how long it’s been 
around and whether it’s in growth mode.
	
✓	How the customer found you.
	
✓	The customer’s need and goals for the project.
	
✓	The proposal and Statement of Work with the list of the deliverables and 
perhaps a timeline for the work, or project plan, if that was part of the 
proposal.
	
✓	All the contacts you have in the customer, their contact details and how 
they’ve been involved up to now.
	
✓	Who on the customer side is going to be heading up the project and who 
else will be involved? See Figure 15-1 for a few proposed connections 
between your team and the customer’s team.
	
✓	The customer’s ‘hot-buttons’: what the customer is sensitive to.
	
✓	Anything unusual that you need the delivery team to be aware of.
	
✓	What you think is important to cover in the kick-off meeting with the 
customer.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
	
When you’ve handed over all the information you have, think about this time 
being a good point at which to have the project manager step in and take over. 
Ideally, you should attend the kick-off meeting with the customer, not to lead 
it but in case queries come up. If you did your handover job well, the kick-off 
goes smoothly and the project is off to a good start.
One area that’s often neglected is the matrix of relationships that needs to 
exist between your company and the customer. Modify this matrix for your 
own purposes, but make sure that the sort of diagram in Figure 15-1 exists so 
that everyone knows who’s expected to take care of whom in the customer 
organization.

matrix.
	
	
Pay particular attention to all the relationships in Figure 15-1. Make especially 
sure that the finance people are connected and that details of invoicing are 
clear. Do they need accounting for hours and expenses? Do deliverables have

 Chapter 15: Closing the Sale to Your Satisfaction
to be signed off by the customer before payment can be made? All too often, 
the first month goes by, the time arrives to invoice the client, but nobody 
knows where to send the invoice or what needs to go with it. Payment is 
delayed because the relationship wasn’t set up right. Make it someone’s 
responsibility to thrash this stuff out.
Backing out gracefully
Attend the kick-off meeting with the customer: make sure that you transi-
tioned well to delivery and that nothing surprising comes up. If it does, you 
have to cycle round with the delivery team to clear up any outstanding ques-
tions or issues. If this process requires further conversations with the cus-
tomer, you may well need to be part of them.
If the kick-off has gone smoothly, your account manager/project manager 
should be well in control after the kick-off meeting. Offer your support, but 
let that person know that individually you need to move on.
	
You may be asking, when should I jump in? Well, that has to be down to your 
judgment. As in any management situation, you want your staff to know that 
they have the authority and the responsibility for handling the customer, in 
good times and bad. Even so, sometimes they may need your help.
Re-engaging with the customer
You may be the designated escalation point if issues arise with the work. If 
so, you have to respond to customers, and quickly, if they call.
If you’re not the escalation point, you may still need to get involved again 
when:
	
✓	Questions come up about the scope. You’re the only person who was at 
every meeting prior to the sale, so make sure that you have good notes, 
emails and other evidence of what was agreed.
	
	Refer to the contract – it supersedes all other documents. You may have 
to get involved in some straight-talking with the customer.
	
✓	The customer doesn’t like the team: that is, ‘we want you back’. The 
customer’s representatives miss you and aren’t overly impressed by the 
team now working with them. In this case, promise to look into it and 
check in with the team about how things are going. Ask your head of 
operations/delivery (if you have one) to dive in and see what’s going on.

Part IV: Seeing What Sales Can Do for You 
The best solution is for that person to support the team and handle the 
situation with the customer. If you have to be the one, ask incisive ques-
tions, because the team often don’t want to admit that they’re struggling 
(that is, the customer may be right). Only insert yourself when you abso-
lutely have to and only in an oversight role.
	
✓	The customer questions the billing and no one can seem to get the 
issue resolved. Sort this problem out as soon as possible, otherwise you 
may be facing a loss and you don’t want the problem to drag on. If the 
problem is just a misunderstanding, you can probably reset the expecta-
tions, but if you have real disagreement, use your negotiation skills to 
make a compromise – perhaps a discount or some other incentive to 
secure future billings. Often, the customer just wants someone to listen – 
or it wants to try it on! Be firm and fair.
	
When talking to prospects, writing proposals and negotiating contracts, try to 
under-promise and over-deliver. The opposite is a disaster, and typically 
results in something you don’t want: a disappointed or even angry customer.
Fortunately, you can also be called in for positive reasons. The customer 
wants to praise the team and to thank you. Perhaps a representative wants to 
talk about a new opportunity or introduce you to a new prospect. Be gracious 
about giving your time and also gently guide the customer to the account 
manager if that’s more appropriate.
‘Say Hello, Wave Goodbye’: 
Finishing Up the Sale
You’re nearly done. You just have to complete your admin and paperwork, 
review the sale (for good or ill) and stay available for new opportunities 
down the line.
Tidying up: Capture everything
As I describe in the preceding section, the information you have about the 
customer is highly important. Make sure to update your customer relation-
ship management (CRM) tool with all your notes and documents and take 
care of some final items:
	
✓	Check that the data about the customer in your SFA/CRM system is up to 
date and accurate. Make sure that you’ve captured the lead source, size 
of company and anything about the sales cycle that was noteworthy (for 
example, what went well and what didn’t).

295
 Chapter 15: Closing the Sale to Your Satisfaction
	
✓	Ensure that the files in the CRM are the latest versions.
	
✓	Make sure that the contract was signed and that you have a copy in the 
CRM (even if the official copy is elsewhere). Too often, contracts can’t 
be found a year or two later when you next need them.
	
✓	Ask the customer whether you can do a press release about the fact that 
you’re working together. Say that you’ll be back to see about a testimo-
nial or case study.
Learning from experience:  
Win/loss reviews
	
About two to three weeks after contract signature, ask the customer whether 
you can do an interview (called the win/loss interview). Although most sales-
people do ask why they lost a deal, they rarely ask why they won – they’re just 
too excited.
Conduct a formal interview (with losses too) to find out who else was in the 
running, what they liked about those competitors and what they didn’t like. 
Find out why they chose you, if they did. Ask them to describe your company 
in three or four words and what would cause you to lose their business. Ask 
informally how things are going with the work.
What you discover from these conversations is great information for the 
team and also for marketing, so share it.
Recognizing the value of evaluation
As the project nears its end, you need to get involved again. Attend internal 
team meetings that are wrapping up the project and any post-project review 
meetings. The agenda should include what happened in the sales process as 
well as on the project. In other words:
	
✓	Review the whole experience.
	
✓	Pick out what worked especially well and make sure to use those things 
again: that is, make them part of the best practices of your firm.
	
✓	Look at what didn’t work and what to change for future engagements.
	
✓	Ask what may be next for this customer, such as any follow-on work or 
new opportunities. Capture those in your CRM and start working them.
Beyond internal review, you also need to do a post-project review with the 
customer, something I cover in Chapter 17.

Generating Success from the 
Customer Relationship
In This Chapter
▶	Sharing the customer within your company
▶	Producing useful information from the customer relationship
A
 
s I’m sure that you’re aware, relationships of all sorts are fundamental 
to business success: relationships within even a small team in your 
company; relationships among the different departments within your firm; 
and, the subject of this chapter, the relationship of your firm with your 
customers.
When a prospect converts to a customer (as I describe in Chapter 15), the 
relationship between your company and the customer enters a period of 
transition. Unless your company is small, with a handful of people doing 
everything, the people who shepherd the sale through aren’t usually the ones 
who deliver the work.
This transition is a delicate matter, as is customer management in general. 
Conflicts between different functions (departments), for example sales 
and delivery, can arise over perceived ownership of customers, which can 
threaten your business development intention for this customer and there-
fore your revenue. So although I address this chapter primarily to account 
and/or project managers, marketing and salespeople are also likely to find it 
valuable.
I lead you through two important aspects of the customer relationship:
	
✓	How to avoid hogging the customer: Sharing the customer creates max-
imum value for your business.
	
✓	How to leverage the customer relationship for ever greater success: 
Perhaps expanding your business with that customer and/or opening 
opportunities with new firms.

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
Back Off, He’s Mine! Remembering that 
the Customer Belongs to Everyone
A person whose specific role is to manage customer relationships (for 
example, someone with a title of account manager or project manager) often 
resents others buzzing around, disrupting the work or confusing the cus-
tomer. Certainly, the idea of identifying one person as the primary point of 
contact for the customer has merit, but if that person feels as if he ‘owns’ the 
relationship, the result can be less productive for your company than it could 
be otherwise.
You don’t want your staff squabbling over customers like teenagers in the 
schoolyard arguing over who’s going out with whom. In this section I examine 
what a thriving customer relationship looks like, covering the necessity of 
sharing and collaboration, as well as describing the ideal result – long-term, 
continuing business with that customer and perhaps with its contacts. To get 
that result, you have to play nicely in the playground.
Sharing the customer relationship
Take a quick look at the customer lifecycle diagram in Chapter 2, Figure 2-1. 
You can see that, depending on where the customer is in the lifecycle at any 
given moment, the function that ‘owns’ the customer changes. As a result, 
one person or team can’t possibly handle the relationship throughout the 
entire process:
	
✓	Marketing supports the customer in the early stages, growing its under-
standing of the consequences of its business pain and how your com-
pany can solve it.
	
✓	Sales takes over later to convert a prospect into a closed deal.
	
✓	Your turn (as account and/or project manager) comes after the cus-
tomer has signed the contract. Your role is to make sure that the work 
goes well and to identify new or extended work opportunities.
	
The problem is that marketing and sales want to stay in the picture and get in 
on the act. The salesperson wants to interview the customer during the first 
month for feedback on the sales process, marketing keeps pestering you to 
see whether it can do a press release and, in the meantime, the customer calls 
to say that one of your business’s people isn’t experienced enough for the 
work. Why can’t marketing and sales butt out and let you get on with taking 
care of the customer?

 Chapter 16: Generating Success from the Customer Relationship
	
To help clarify, bear in mind that the relationship has two sides:
	
✓	Delivering the work successfully
	
✓	Developing the business
In the heat of the project, business development typically gets neglected, or 
may not even be considered at all (ouch!).
Table 16-1 shows some key aspects of the customer relationship under the 
two headings.

time and on budget. Having a happy 
customer. This goal involves some of 
the following tasks:
Primary goal: Having a happy cus-

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
You don’t need to be a rocket scientist to figure out who’s interested in the 
outcomes of all these tasks: the business owner, marketing, sales, finance and 
the rest of the team in general all have a stake in things going well.
	
But a conflict exists between trying to handle the relationship from a delivery 
standpoint, whether as an account manager who’s probably more attuned to 
business development, or as a project manager who’s focused on managing 
the work to deliver on time and on budget.
Collaborating for customer success
Although the revenue target, the next project or leveraging the customer rela-
tionship may not be your specific responsibility as account and/or project 
manager, such things are undoubtedly important:
	
✓	The easiest way to get additional revenue is from existing customers. 
Typically, getting new work from an existing customer requires only a 
quarter as much effort as making a sale to a completely new customer.
	
✓	The best type of lead is a referral from a person that the new prospect 
trusts. Your customer has contacts that you want to get to know.
	
✓	Customer case studies/references are proof that your firm is competent.
All the business development tasks that I show in the right column of the 
earlier Table 16-1, and more, are perfectly legitimate at the appropriate stage 
in the project, so collaboration between account/project management and 
other functions is important.
Here I discuss how you can stop other internal parties from treading on your 
toes and yet still be open and collaborative.
Understanding the psychology of the team and the customer
You’re not in account/project management by coincidence – and neither is 
it coincidence that salespeople are into selling and that marketing is into 
doing its magic with early-stage customers. Job descriptions don’t come into 
it – instead, certain people do certain jobs due to psychology. If you map the 
capabilities to do a job to people’s underlying personality traits, you discover 
some interesting parallels. In fact, if you follow a career that aligns with your 
strengths, you’re far more likely to be successful. (I talk more about person-
alities and the customer lifecycle in Chapter 4.)
	
If you feel like a round peg in a square hole, you haven’t quite found the right 
place for your talents.

 Chapter 16: Generating Success from the Customer Relationship
In the context of business development, the skills show up as follows:
	
✓	Inventing: The process of creating new services offerings, getting them 
out to the marketplace and measuring results – tends to suit entrepre-
neurs, business owners, visionaries and marketing.
	
✓	Presenting: The activity of positioning services with customers and get-
ting their buy-in – suits sales.
	
✓	Producing: The effort of getting the work done and managing all the 
details of the customer project and relationship – suits account/project 
management.
	
✓	Judging: The business of handling the money and legal niceties – suits 
finance and legal.
Business thrives when all four skill sets are represented in your company and 
when they work together towards the ultimate goal – increasing revenue and 
profit while doing satisfying work.
	
The same logic applies to your customers, so start identifying the personality 
types there too and match them to roles. You’ll be surprised how often they’re 
a close fit.
Knowing who does what
When you sort out what type of personality does what job, and connect this 
idea to the need to serve customers, you can see that sharing the relation-
ships is going to be the most productive approach: it allows the team to 
spread out the load of customer management and get some varying and often 
useful perspectives. Table 16-2 contains some suggested pairings and the 
logic behind them. (Refer to Figure 15-1 for a useful relationship matrix.)
The model in Table 16-2 suits a larger customer; for smaller ones, trim down 
the team quite a bit. For example, the CEO can’t necessarily pay attention to 
every customer.
When you, as a business owner or senior leader, align roles and/or concerns 
between team members and those at the customer organization, your firm 
has a robust and supportive vendor/customer relationship and gleans a lot of 
useful information along the way.
	
As account or project manager, ensure that you’re copied in on all communi-
cations and invited to all meetings, even if you choose not to attend. Part of 
the role is to avoid disruption, so if anyone, such as the CEO or salesperson, 
wants to meet with the customer, they should gather intelligence from you 
first. Nothing’s worse than someone from your company marching in to the 
customer and finding a big issue is going on that they knew nothing about and 
could’ve helped with if only someone had told them.

Table 16-2	
Matching Who Does What in the  
	
Customer Relationship
Your Company
The Customer
CEO (inventing): Point of strategic con-
tact. Should reach out to the customer 
periodically (beginning, mid and end of 
project, or every three months).
CEO: Interested in what’s next, getting 
strategic advice, surrounding them-
selves with trusted advisors: wants 
return on investment (ROI).
Account manager (presenting/
producing): Has oversight of all the 
work going on in the project. High-
level advice and direction to guide 
the sponsor(s). Looking to expand 
relationships.
Project sponsor: Needs to see the 
project(s) be successful. Probably 
holds the budget. Concerned to see 
the project succeed and to get on to 
the next thing. Often juggling multiple 
responsibilities.
Project manager (producing): 
Managing the day-to-day matters of 
projects.
Project manager: Ditto.
Team members (producing): Doing the 
work.
Project contacts: Providing information 
so that the actual work can get done.
Controller/finance (judging): Wants 
efficient billing, quick payment, and 
speedy resolution of issues.
Accounts payable: Wants to delay pay-
ment as long as possible. Wants cost 
reduction (and so is interested in ROI).
Salesperson (presenting): Looking for 
the next opportunity/chance to pitch 
something. Wants to keep in touch 
with existing relationships and get new 
ones. Can relate to multiple levels in 
the customer organization.
Various: When vendor is trusted, has 
a problem they want fixing. Looking to 
see whether your firm can do that or 
refer them to someone else.
Managing the project to a successful conclusion
Unless your firm’s on retainer, the project is eventually completed, hopefully 
successfully. From a business development perspective, this completion is a 
significant achievement:
	
✓	You can turn a satisfied customer into an advocate for your business.
	
✓	You can leverage customer testimonials, case studies and references for 
future work.
	
✓	You can look for additional business from the current project sponsor or 
from other people in the customer organization who need your services.
	
✓	You may get referrals to other prospects.

 Chapter 16: Generating Success from the Customer Relationship
The foundation for creating these opportunities doesn’t get put in place at 
the end of the project. It develops along the way through the interactions the 
team has with all the customer contacts.
	
Customer contacts talk to each other! Every team member has the responsibil-
ity to handle customer communications with care and to report issues quickly 
to the account manager/project manager.
What are the significant actions that ensure a solid customer relationship 
from which your firm can reap benefits later? Whatever your role, be well 
briefed before you meet the customer. Do your research on its business and 
people. Take responsibility for everything, even things that are not your 
responsibility.
For account/project managers, here are a few specific ideas:
	
✓	Have a really good kick-off meeting (see Chapter 15).
	
✓	Create a risk-assessment and mitigation plan.
	
✓	Share status regularly, so that the customer knows what’s happening on 
the project.
	
✓	Be open about issues. Never sweep concerns under the carpet. 
Customers prefer to hear the bad news early, so communicate about any 
problems and your proposed solutions.
	
	Whether it’s technically your problem, the customer’s or another ven-
dor’s, it is always your problem.
	
✓	Wrap up the project effectively. In your haste to be done, don’t neglect 
to get customer sign-offs and feedback (more on that in Chapter 17).
	
Check out Project Management For Dummies by Stanley E Portny (Wiley).
Some of the interactions that need to occur during a project can be pretty 
uncomfortable. Practice is necessary to become confident handling what is, 
after all, routine on projects – things not going according to plan.
	
Relationships with customers improve when your company deals with issues 
effectively, but they deteriorate when you hide things.
Caring for your people
A saying goes that if you have happy people, you have happy customers. 
Keeping your people happy doesn’t just mean a beer keg/wine on Friday 
afternoons. Folks who work in services businesses want to do well, learn 
things, advance their careers and pursue interesting work. Yes, they want to 
earn more money too, but that alone is never enough.

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
If you, as the account/project manager, have line management for project 
teams, or you’re just managing their project participation and performance, 
your role includes leading, coaching and growing your team. Your business 
can gain huge benefits by addressing this aspect as follows:
	
✓	Keep your staff from walking down the street and taking another job – 
keeping them provides continuity of the team and makes your custom-
ers feel secure. Your firm incurs a big cost when it loses people.
	
✓	Identify future leaders. Some team members are fine where they are – 
others want to progress. You should know these preferences about your 
team and help people get the outcomes they want.
	
✓	Encourage team members to discuss progress of the work and ask for 
help or advice if they get stuck or encounter a problem. When you’re 
open about project challenges with your staff, they reciprocate. Don’t 
rule by fear.
	
✓	Handle the occasional underperforming team members – your firm 
can’t carry people who aren’t productive. Work with HR and manage-
ment to see whether you can move the person to a more suitable posi-
tion within the company. If you have to let someone go, do it quickly and 
kindly in accordance with company policy.
	
✓	Include junior people in senior meetings whenever possible. Create 
an opportunity for them to show their expertise. Give them feedback to 
encourage their communication skills.
	
✓	Support staff development programs in your business. Try to secure 
training, performance reviews and other means to expand your team’s 
capabilities. Encourage your management to develop career paths for all 
job roles. People stay motivated when they know that they can progress 
career-wise.
Yasmin comes up smelling sweetly
Yasmin has a software implementation busi-
ness where the projects are extremely com-
plex. Her staff-development strategy includes 
bringing new team members in and placing 
them on well-established teams for their first 
project. The team allocates a mentor for the 
‘newbie’, preferably someone in a similar role, 
who spends around two hours per week shar-
ing information about the project methodology, 
how to deal with issues or concerns, and who 
to talk to if something comes up that the new 
staff member doesn’t know how to tackle.
The support they receive prepares them to

 Chapter 16: Generating Success from the Customer Relationship
	
A strong delivery team is priceless in supporting the growth of your company. 
No one can influence that on a day-to-day basis as much as an account or proj-
ect manager. Make time for it.
Creating a lifetime customer
Quite simply, the underpinning for a spectacular customer relationship is 
trust. Throughout the customer lifecycle, your firm needs to build trust with 
the customer in order, ultimately, to create a customer for life.
Even if your business’s projects are short, your customer base is worth nur-
turing. Initially, though, the following items help you to be the best you can 
for your customer:
	
✓	Create delight: Delighted customers are a joy to work with. Give them 
your best and they tend to see your firm that way. They forgive small 
irritations quickly (but not too many!). To delight, you need to deliver 
flawlessly, take customer feedback and show that you’ve applied it, and 
then say thank you. Small things work – a gas gift card if they agree to do 
a case study, for example.
	
✓	Be a trusted advisor: When customers are interested in your opinion 
across every area of their business, you know that you’ve made it into 
the hallowed ranks. As an account/project manager, you want to be 
extra valuable to the customer. Don’t forget that each contact in the 
company is worth time and effort. Know your stuff – their business, 
trends around your offer, other people they could work with who you 
trust. Be objective in conversations, not self-serving.
	
✓	Connect socially: If you share leisure interests with your customers, 
even better. You get more quality time on the golf course than in the 
office. Don’t fake it, but when a customer invites you for holiday drinks 
at his home, that’s where you find yourself mixing with other trusted 
advisors.
	
The higher up your contacts are in the customer organization, the more able 
they are to take straight-talk. Leaders don’t like ‘yes-men’ – they want your 
honest opinion. Lower down the organization, by contrast, straight-talk can 
be threatening, because junior people don’t have the power to pursue an out-
come that you may be recommending. These people want to keep their heads 
down and out of trouble. The exceptions are people who see themselves as 
future leaders.

Tell Me What I Mean To You: Securing 
Value from Your Customers
Over and above delivering a project to your customer’s satisfaction, your 
firm can obtain plenty of value out of your customers – if you bother to ask 
for it. Therefore, I talk you through carrying out a formal customer review 
and keeping in touch with customers in the future. This post-project work 
is the most neglected area of business development and yet it has huge 
potential for more business – if you just ask. This section gives you a formal 
process for asking for what you want – a good ongoing relationship with your 
customer, feedback on how to do better, and, of course, new business. It 
also forms the foundation for deeper client development work that I cover in 
Chapters 17 and 18.
Understanding your value through the 
customer’s eyes
Whatever value you think you bring to your customers, their view is sure to 
be quite different: it definitely pays to ask.
	
You want to understand your value (or, heaven forbid, lack of it) in a number 
of areas, and the best way to do so is with a formal customer review process. 
Although you can sometimes gather useful bits of information informally 
along the way, they tend to get lost in the day-to-day rushing around. Using a 
properly constructed review, usually in the form of a questionnaire, is the way 
to go. You can also compare how different customers view you qualitatively 
(through their comments) and quantitatively (through their scores).
Itemizing what customer reviews cover
The aim of a formal customer review is to get an impression of the relation-
ship with your firm’s customer overall and across all stages of the project. To 
do this, you need questions relating to the following:
	
✓	Project: Quality of deliverables, the time it took and the outcomes.
	
✓	Staffing: How does the customer rate your firm’s staff on the project?
	
✓	Communications: Are they sufficient and of the right type?
	
✓	Others aspects: How the sales process went and the transition from 
sales to delivery and invoicing.

 Chapter 16: Generating Success from the Customer Relationship
	
One of the best practices for customer review processes is to have the cus-
tomer compare you to its ideal vendor. The customer can then score your 
performance by comparing to a somewhat objective, unemotional standard. 
You also want to gather specific comments, especially if a score is in the lower 
range.
Conducting the customer review process
Although automating the process with an online questionnaire is tempting, 
pause for a moment and think about how you personally tend to fill in ques-
tionnaires. Are you slow and thoughtful, or do you get through it as fast as 
you can? Most people do the latter.
	
Instead, the preferred approach is to get with the customer in person and 
ask the questions face-to-face: you need 30–45 minutes. I suggest having two 
people present – one to ask the questions and one to do the scribing, or filling 
in the form on a tablet: listening while you’re writing is difficult.
If necessary, you can do the interview on the phone, but doing so is much 
less valuable. The fact that you take the trouble to go to the customer’s office 
to get the feedback is impressive. Plus, you get to see the person’s body lan-
guage, which can tell you a lot!
Ideally, the person interviewing the customer shouldn’t be someone who 
worked on the project, including the account/project manager: better that 
the interviewer is the owner or another account manager, because then the 
customer is more likely to ‘spill the beans’.
	
Don’t interrupt or get into a debate about what the customer is saying. The 
trick is to make sure that the person is fully heard, without someone start-
ing to argue or justify. The customer’s point of view is valid, even if you don’t 
agree with it. Your role is to listen, record and ask for clarification if need be. 
Don’t push back: you’re not a hard-bitten cop trying to catch out a low-life 
criminal in Law & Order!
You may have to interview several people at the customer organization – you 
want as much feedback as you can get.
To see what a typical customer review form may look like, check out the snip-
pet in Figure 16-1, which shows one section of a customer review. You need to 
create one appropriate to your own business.
	
Figure 16-1’s form uses a concept called conformance: shorthand for whether 
you measure up to that perfect vendor to which the customer is comparing 
you. Using a scoring system allows you to see areas of excellence and under-
performance at a glance.

Feeding back to the team
Whether you think that some of your customers are a pain in the neck or not, 
it’s a good day when you get all fives. But the comments often give you the 
highest value feedback, because they tell you specifically what the customer 
thinks, what you may be able to use to build testimonials and collateral or, if 
the comment was negative, what you need to work on internally to improve.
Ideally, share your customer review metrics with your executives, together 
with the comments, and aggregate them with results from other customers to 
give you an overall score. You can set good goals around those scores to see 
how far you can raise them.
You also want to share the individual review results with the team that did 
the work. As well as making the team feel good (generally) about what the 
members have achieved, doing so prompts discussion about improvements, 
which is always beneficial.
	
Be circumspect about how you divulge comments about individuals, espe-
cially if negative. Even particularly positive comments about one person on 
the team can make the others feel that, even though they were working their 
socks off, they weren’t appreciated.
	
Start putting together your own customer review form. Write down the areas 
you’d like to ask questions about and then start brainstorming questions with 
your management and sales and marketing folks. My own version includes 
sections for the overall relationship, the project, the team, our competence 
and partnership (as in Figure 16-1) and how we compare to other vendors. It

 Chapter 16: Generating Success from the Customer Relationship
also has a section where I ask whether the customer would be a reference or 
is willing for us to write a case study. I ask about future work and referrals to 
other departments (see the next section ‘Asking for more’).
Asking for more
One of the great things about a customer review process is that by the end of 
the main part of the review, the customer is lulled into a state of appreciation 
(assuming that you’ve done an okay job, of course). This point is where you 
stop asking for information and ask for what you want.
Here are a few ideas of the sorts of things you can request at this stage in 
your relationship:
	
✓	Testimonials and/or case studies: Sometimes, the contract excludes 
these things, but if not ask for them. Don’t expect the customer to do 
any work. Write up a summary of the customer, the challenge it faced, 
the solution you provided and the results you produced. A direct quote 
from a customer can be a perfect testimonial. Sometimes the results 
from the project don’t show up for a few months, so you may have to 
come back later for data for a case study.
	
	Give this information to marketing and let them draft the testimonial/
case study for the customer’s approval. (Check out the template for a 
case study in Figure 16-2.) If you have any good emails from the cus-
tomer commenting on the excellence of your work, be sure to give those 
to marketing too.
	
	Creating case studies for customers can be a tricky business. You have 
to follow their rules regarding usage of their logo or other brand ele-
ments. They may have style guidelines that help marketing. Find out 
who needs to approve a case study and how long the process is. Bigger 
companies tend to move more slowly and be more formal; it can take 
weeks.
	
✓	References: If your customers regularly take up references before they 
do business with you, you need a fresh supply of new customers willing 
to provide one so that you don’t exhaust your favorite customers. Most 
give you a glowing reference, even if some minor issues occurred during 
the project. Customers like to help.
	
✓	Future work: If you’ve been communicating effectively with the cus-
tomer throughout the project, you may have some sense of what’s 
coming next for its department. At the end of the project, you can defi-
nitely ask.

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
	
✓	Additional contacts: You can also ask if you’d benefit from any introduc-
tions to others in the organization. If you do good account planning (see 
Chapter 17), you already know who you want to get close to. Upselling 
to an existing customer is much easier than acquiring a new one.
	
✓	External contacts: The customer may be willing to introduce you to 
other relationships within other companies. After all, they’re not locked 
up in their offices for eight hours a day – they’re out and about at net-
working events, conferences and social functions discussing business.
	
Figure 16-2: 
Case study 
template.
	
	
As the final section on the customer review, include questions that cover the 
above items. You have their attention – so use it!
If you have any information you can give informally to salespeople about the 
customer and your results, share it. Salespeople can use this material ver-
bally with prospects, even if a formal case study isn’t available yet.
	
The later stages of the project, during project review, as I discuss in Chapter 15, 
are the ideal times to bring the salesperson back into the account, especially 
for developing and exploring possible new projects with other departments 
in your customer organization or with wholly new companies. This approach 
saves a lot of time, because you may well have another customer you need to 
be working on. Yup, salespeople have their uses.

 Chapter 16: Generating Success from the Customer Relationship
Turning the customer into  
an active advocate
After the work is done, you can easily forget your faithful customer: after all, 
you have to move on. However, if you can keep in touch with your prior cus-
tomers, they keep you in mind when a new opportunity arises.
See whether you can:
	
✓	Join the groups that your customers belong to, offline and online. It 
helps you understand who and what they’re interacting with. Don’t be 
shy to ask them whether you can join them at a specific event. They’ll 
probably introduce you to anyone they know or just enjoy spending 
time with you.
	
✓	Ask for introductions to people they know. LinkedIn is a great source: 
you can do your research and be specific about who you’re trying to 
connect with.
	
✓	Help customers if they ask you for advice. It may be a referral to 
another firm that can help them with a problem or some information 
that they don’t know where to find. Make yourself useful.
	
✓	Follow up on introductions and contacts. When you sign a contract 
with a new customer referred to you by an existing one, send a little gift 
to the customer contact who introduced you.
	
✓	But make sure that doing so is acceptable: in some companies and 
almost universally across the public sector, you won’t be allowed.
	
Don’t try to be all things to all customers: select the ones you believe can 
provide value to you and then make some effort in their direction. The more 
value you provide to your customers, the more they’ll want to reciprocate: it’s 
simply good for business.

Joining Together to 
Maximize Business and 
Customer Value
In This Chapter
▶	Making business development everyone’s business
▶	Considering the role of account planning for customer growth
▶	Turning the delivery team into great business developers
T
 
he key to good customer management is to have great account managers, 
so in this chapter I focus on your account/customer/project managers 
(and their boss) who lead the teams working on the customers’ projects. 
These people can have various titles, but they’re usually part of delivery 
(sometimes called operations) and they lead and can encourage the whole 
of the delivery team to get involved in business development in one way or 
another.
Although business development looks as if it belongs to the marketing and 
salespeople and is nothing to do with anyone else in the organization, when 
you accept and communicate that everyone in the business is responsible 
for it, you increase your chance of thriving. The account managers are the 
lynchpin.
In this chapter, I look at how account managers need to be effective in 
business development, and how to motivate the whole of your company 
to push the business-development bandwagon and support your plans for 
growth. I describe the roles of account planning and account managers in 
this task and show how delivery can be vital by obtaining invaluable feed-
back for you.

You Know It Makes Sense: Seeing How 
Business Development Benefits All
If people in your organization think ‘business development isn’t my job’, 
you’re coming out of the gate at a distinct disadvantage. I’m not exaggerating 
when I say that everyone in your company contributes to the health of the 
business in one way or another: remember that a healthy organism grows 
and prospers.
In this section I look at how every function in your business contributes to 
business health, including making everyone a ‘business developer’ (in a gen-
eral sense) and encouraging effective motivation and communication.
Creating an organization in 
which everyone sells
	
Your aim is to create a ‘selling’ organization, one in which everyone is pulling 
in the same direction for new customers, happy customers and high profit.
This goal may not be as far away as you think. Table 17-1 shows how your 
people may be contributing to business development already, without even 
knowing it. All these roles are working on behalf of the company to grow your 
business and make it successful and every one of them has a part to play in 
the development of your firm.
Table 17-1	
How Your People Contribute to  
	
Business Development
Role
How the Function Contributes to 
Business Development
CEO/owners
Provide leadership, customer confidence and 
expertise and are often the best ‘salespeople’ in 
the company. Can smooth over difficult customer 
situations.
Finance
Handles customer invoicing and payments with 
accuracy and efficiency. Looks after collections, 
minimizes bad debt, keeps costs low and maxi-
mizes profit. Supports investment and growth.

 Chapter 17: Joining Together to Maximize Business and Customer Value
Role
How the Function Contributes to 
Business Development
Human resources
Finds the best people who perform well. Takes care 
of employee concerns and takes the lead on ensur-
ing employee satisfaction, resulting in good work 
and delighted customers.
Marketing
Positions the company and brand in the market-
place and is ultimately responsible for generating 
leads. Makes sure that the company’s reputation is 
taken care of and enhanced.
Sales
Converts leads into deals. Leverages relationships 
and partnerships to deliver more opportunities. 
Cross-sells (develops and sells to new contacts) 
and upsells (to existing customers). Represents 
the company in the marketplace in a wide variety 
of ways.
Customer/account/project 
management (usually part 
of delivery)
Acts as the day-to-day face of your company 
to the customer, offering business advice, com-
munication, issue resolution and smoothing over 
less critical customer situations (and critical ones 
sometimes). Looks for new opportunities, gets case 
studies and testimonials, and asks for referrals.
Delivery team
Does the work with integrity and efficiency. 
Provides the ultimate value to customers by solving 
their business problems, hence creating customer 
advocates. Provides the proof to new prospects 
that your firm can do what you say it can.
Customer service
Handles customer questions and concerns on a 
day-to-day basis, often when the main work is over. 
Used where customers need ongoing services (as 
in support or maintenance agreements). Creates 
happy customers.
Legal
Avoids risk by making sure that contracts are robust 
and that no one sells the company down the river.
Beyond their day-to-day work, which is already a significant contribution, 
people like nothing more than being able to find or refer a prospective new 
customer. Not everyone has the knack for doing so, but you can encourage 
the whole organization to think of itself as a selling organization, looking for 
new opportunities and new customers, working on higher profits or more 
efficient ways to do the work, or being extra attentive to the customer and 
impeccable in communication.

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
	
One way to achieve this goal is to motivate the behaviors that you want, for 
example:
	
✓	Offer an incentive when an employee relationship results in a new deal.
	
✓	Give a bonus to anyone who refers a new employee, with a second 
­payment if that person stays for more than six months.
	
✓	Create a competition for the most profitable project/customer team.
	
✓	Set up an annual bonus pool to share the profits with your employees.
The reward doesn’t always have to be money, of course: company acknowl-
edgements, gift cards or even a party work well too. Mix it up a bit, so that 
people don’t always expect cold hard cash.
Doesn’t that all sound peachy – the whole organization pulling together to get 
the results that everyone wants? Oh, if only things were always like that!
When you move your business towards a model of unified purpose, you’re 
doing ‘business development’ on your own business.
Being a motivating business
In many firms, unfortunately, some people, in whatever role, prefer to point 
the finger and lay the culpability for sub-par results at someone else’s door. 
When you think about this behavior, it can seem like cutting off your nose to 
spite your face, especially if you’re a business leader. You want to motivate, 
not accuse.
Ensuring that your firm doesn’t demotivate
Picture the following scenes:
	
✓	Marketing is unable to generate solid leads – should they be pilloried by 
all and sundry?
	
✓	Sales wins a new contract, but the scope turns out to be bigger than you 
anticipate and the project looks as if it will lose money – is the depart-
ment incompetent?
	
✓	Sales is going through a dry spell and can’t seem to win a deal – is that 
the salespeople’s fault?
To a certain extent, when things don’t go well, people do have to step up and 
get into action, which means admitting the problem and asking for help. But 
when a culture of blame exists in your organization, asking for support can 
be very difficult.

319
 Chapter 17: Joining Together to Maximize Business and Customer Value
	
Imagine a customer calling you and yelling down the phone about a poor 
deliverable. Do you look to convict someone of the crime? Are you a motivat-
ing or demotivating force?
Picture instead a context in which a new project manager identifies that a 
project is turning out to be more complex than anyone expected and goes to 
talk to the salesperson to share the situation and find out about the history 
of the sale. The discussion uncovers what happened and they go to your CEO 
to explain the state of affairs and propose next steps. They set up a meeting 
with the customer and negotiate a modification to the scope so that the proj-
ect can proceed. That would be a great outcome.
	
You can no doubt see that communication pays a vitally important role here 
(check out the later section ‘Talking about team communication’).
Motivating everyone to do their bit
	
Here are some ways in which everyone in the business can do their job while 
pulling together as a team and acting in the company’s best interests:
	
✓	Inspire people about the role they play in the company. If you ask one 
stonemason what she’s doing she may say, ‘I’m carving this block to 
this pattern.’ If you ask another he may say, ‘I’m building a skyscraper.’ 
Awareness of the wider context (the big picture) provides the inspira-
tion. Take a look at Chapters 7 and 13 for rolling out your business devel-
opment strategy.
	
✓	Incentivize people for the right behavior (see the earlier section 
‘Creating an organization in which everyone sells’ for some ideas).
	
✓	Create structures, processes and opportunities for collaboration across 
functions. In other words, you want all the people from Table 17-1 to feel 
part of a selling organization, to harness the potential that inherently 
exists if they’d only work together.
You can achieve all the above only with good plans and consistently great 
communication.
Talking about team communication
	
At the root of issues with business growth is a weakness in team communica-
tion. Here are a few of the sorts of things that arise as common problems:
	
✓	The functions of marketing, sales, customer management and delivery 
become separate from each other, each doing their ‘own thing’.
	
✓	Important information about prospects and customers doesn’t get 
shared across the functional boundaries.
www.ebook777.com

320
Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
	
✓	People are heads-down, working on their own tasks and ignoring the 
contribution that they could make to others on the team.
	
✓	Feedback from customers or between departments is often weak or non-
existent. The company is busy doing work, but not using the customer 
or internal resources systematically to improve and elevate the offer.
Of course, everyone relates to the mindset of ‘this is my job and that’s some-
one else’s’. Wanting to draw boundaries that help define and limit respon-
sibility is natural. The risk of this conventional ‘job description’ mentality, 
though, is that it fails to maximize the potential and value of every employee.
	
Look at the customer lifecycle diagram in Figure 2-1 and use it for this exercise 
with your team. Ask each of them to look at the diagram and to note down the 
following:
	
✓	The part of the customer lifecycle they think they own
	
✓	Where they see their function overlapping into other parts of the life-
cycle, owned by someone else
	
✓	How they think they can contribute to other parts of the lifecycle
The results of this exercise are often illuminating. Most functions feel that 
they can provide useful information to help develop and enhance services, 
hone marketing messages to help them have a more positive impact, support 
the sales process to make it faster and less risky, and support customers and 
partner relationships for maximum mutual benefit.
	
Use the feedback from this exercise to develop good communication practices 
for your company.
Table 17-2 shows types of communication that are worth your time and 
attention and make a difference to the growth of your business. Almost 
every company benefits from addressing these aspects.

Communication
How it helps
Marketing emails and other 
outbound communications
Staff members often don’t know what’s being 
communicated to your target market. Keeping 
the team informed as to what’s going out, what 
new collateral has been created and where your 
company is advertising offline or online, is help-
ful for everyone in conversations they have with 
prospects, customers and partners.

 Chapter 17: Joining Together to Maximize Business and Customer Value
Communication
How it helps
Scope of a prospect’s 
project
Salespeople often try to figure out how to meet 
prospect requirements so that they can create 
a proposal quickly. Sharing the scope of a 
prospect’s project allows the delivery team to 
help – maybe they’ve dealt with a similar situation 
before.
Informal information coming 
from a customer
From good news to bad, customer feedback in 
any form is valuable to the team. Fold positive 
feedback into marketing messaging that can 
be used by sales and leveraged to boost team 
self-esteem. You can share and jointly tackle 
negatives and consider new ideas for future 
enhancements to almost every aspect of the 
business.
Significant communications 
or updates
Throughout the customer lifecycle, the whole 
team should know about certain key events – a 
customer signed a contract or Statement of 
Work, a project won an award, a case study just 
got created, the website had a facelift. Try to 
avoid anyone saying ‘I didn’t know that!’
Organizing the work in easily 
accessible project folders
To avoid being bombardment with TMI (too much 
information), organize documents in a repository 
and make sure that everyone knows where to find 
them. Some solutions even allow you to set alerts 
when specific types of documents get updated.
Joint account brainstorming/
planning
A customer is a valuable commodity – do some 
account planning for your most significant and 
valuable customers (see the tip in this section on 
scheduling marketing and sales reviews and also 
the later section ‘Making the Most of Account 
Planning’).
‘I have an idea’ suggestions
Create a simple mechanism for gathering and 
sharing good ideas. Take them seriously and see 
whether they’re worth implementing.
Any intelligence coming 
from market research, com-
petitor activity, customer 
and partner feedback
Share formal information – great blogs or 
­whitepapers, activities that competitors are 
doing, formal feedback from customers and 
partners.

For your periodic meetings, do the marketing and sales review in the morning 
(check out Chapter 13) and a customer review and any training in the after-
noon (see the next section). Get these meetings scheduled at the beginning of 
the year and don’t allow people to duck out. If customer needs come up, your 
team has to say that they’re not available on those days. Mondays and Fridays 
are good days for these meetings, because customers tend to be a little less 
active. Also, don’t schedule status meetings and the like for those days (or 
move them if they are already there).
	
Good communication pays off big time in increased revenue.
Making the Most of Account Planning
Before everyone starts running around looking for new customers, a good 
idea is to create a focus for business development activity. One area that 
most companies neglect is their existing customers. Sure, they’re happy to 
take the call when a customer gets on the phone to talk about new work, but 
they’re not usually proactive in their customer management. That starts with 
account planning and gives the team goals and tasks to get their teeth into.
As part of your business development plan (see Chapter 6), you set some 
pretty ambitious goals. You break your revenue plan down into three 
categories:
	
✓	Revenue that you can rely on (already covered by a signed contract, that 
is, booked business)
	
✓	New revenue that could come from your existing customers
	
✓	Revenue that needs to come from completely new customers
Part of your strategy is to make sure that you maximize revenue from your 
current customers.
This section details the essential role of account planning as the foundation 
of good customer management and I concentrate on new revenue from exist-
ing customers. I cover understanding where your revenue will come from, 
how to achieve your goals and creating your firm’s account plan.
	
If you’re a project-based company (one job and you’re done), this section’s 
material on the potential to upsell (increase or add new business with your 
existing contacts) or cross-sell (develop new contacts and sell to them) may be 
less relevant. Even so, these practices turn your account managers into super-
stars, so use what’s going to benefit you.

 Chapter 17: Joining Together to Maximize Business and Customer Value
Analyzing where your revenue 
will come from
Maybe you have existing contracts that roll right into next year, January and 
beyond. Maybe you have ideas on where you’re going to find new business 
within the customer base. The thing is, you don’t achieve your goals by acci-
dent. You need to plan to get there and that starts with account planning.
	
Your revenue is going to come from new clients too. I cover this aspect in 
Chapter 6, where I also talk about your current customers. Use Chapter 6 for 
preliminary planning (including Figures 6-1 through 6-4).
I’m assuming that you have a spreadsheet with your goals broken down to 
revenue coming from customers (and who they all are and where the money 
is expected to come from). If you don’t deliver on that part of the plan, you 
put a lot of pressure on your sales team to sell more than they originally 
anticipated – or you just won’t reach your goal.
Turning goals into reality
Account planning turns those desired numbers into a real possibility. If your 
account/project managers are naturals at customer/account management, 
they already have ideas about how to expand the business with your custom-
ers. Capitalize on their insights.
	
If your account management function is weak, however, you may have to use 
salespeople (perhaps that’s you) to drive new business in existing customers. 
Therefore, add to your strategic initiatives for the year the goal to strengthen 
your account management team and practices. Use Chapters 16 and 18 to 
help you. The later section ‘Growing, Growing, Gone! Account Managers’ Role 
in Your Growth Plans’ also includes ideas on how to get account managers 
comfortable with upselling.
What you need to include in your account planning depends quite a bit on 
the size and nature of your customers and your service:
	
✓	If you work with mainly mid-sized businesses, say $100–500 million 
(£63–347 million), the account planning can be fairly straightforward, 
because the power to buy tends to lie in a few hands.
	
✓	If you deal with mega-businesses, the situation is quite different and 
more like handling several smaller businesses that just happen to come 
under the same umbrella. Done well, you can have a meal-ticket for 
life from Fortune 1000 companies, but you need to invest in excellent 
account managers who probably can split their time between getting 
new opportunities as well as billing some hours to cover their costs.

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
	
If you can apply your service across different departments or divisions in a 
customer, you have a lot of potential for expanding the work you do. But when 
your service is more focused on a single department or function, it may lend 
itself to a long-term contract situation.
Either way, start account planning modestly and work up from there. I’ve 
seen account planning documents that are 20 pages long. Personally, I prefer 
something like a sales battlecard (see Chapter 14): 1–2 pages only and 
revised every three months with updated goals and actions.
Deciding what to include in 
your account plan
	
Here are a few things that you may want to include in your account planning:
	
✓	Information about the customer, the current relationships and work 
being done. This information serves two purposes:
	
–	It reminds the account manager of the status quo.
	
–	It informs anyone else who’s going to be involved in the account of 
the current situation.
	
✓	Key metrics about the current work. Examples are profitability and 
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), namely how long customers take to 
pay you.
	
✓	Date of last customer review and the scores and key areas being 
worked on. See Chapter 16 for all about this process.
	
✓	Additional relationships you want to develop in the customer orga-
nization. These relationships may be people to whom your current 
contacts can introduce you, or people you can just go after on your own. 
Again, the customer review process from Chapter 16 is helpful in asking 
for internal referrals.
	
✓	Potential new opportunities identified. Perhaps through conversations 
with the customer, or ideas on what you can offer that the existing con-
tacts or new ones may be interested in.
	
Pin the account plan over account managers’ desks: nothing works as well 
as keeping it front-of-mind. Figure 17-1 shows an example account-planning 
template. Fill the boxes in the order as numbered – it helps you develop your 
thinking around how to impact results with each customer.

Figure 17-1: 
Account-
planning 
template.
	
Part of the annual cycle is to prepare an initial account plan for each major 
account. Don’t get too ambitious – set a few simple goals for the first quarter 
and then revisit and update at the quarterly meetings (check out Chapter 13). 
Use account managers and delivery team members in account planning – 
they all have insights into how to develop a customer more fully.
	
By all means skip customers without potential, but don’t neglect the customer 
review process. New opportunities show up in surprising places – you never 
know who your contacts know until you ask.
Growing, Growing, Gone! Account 
Managers’ Role in Your  
Growth Plans
Before you send your account managers out into the hostile world of upselling 
and cross-selling (see the preceding section), consider doing some staff devel-
opment. Selling doesn’t come naturally to some account managers, who often 
just grow into a role or do it by default, instead of being born to it. Time spent 
in regular training sessions is a gift that keeps on giving.
This section delves into what account managers need to get comfortable 
with.

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
Showing account managers how 
to do business development
To be successful in upselling and cross-selling, your account managers need 
to start looking at the bigger picture – not just to see how much money you 
can beat out of your long-suffering customer contacts, but how you increase 
your value to them and create potential value for others in their company. 
This bigger picture requires more than suggesting that they use your x, y or z 
service, now that they’re done with a, b and c.
	
Your account managers need to do the same sorts of things that business 
development leaders do to add value and sell new services, except that 
they’re doing it in the narrower context of a single customer (or maybe two 
or three). So if you’re an account manager, what does that look like? Here is a 
selection of things to work on:
	
✓	Know your customer inside out. What are the company’s goals, what 
business moves or changes may be coming, where is it showing up in 
the news and what are its competitors doing? Much of this information 
is freely available on the Internet, or various information services can 
deliver it straight to your inbox (something your salespeople are likely 
to be using already).
	
✓	Understand the organization structure and where your current con-
tacts sit within that structure. Some information tools give you that too, 
or you can build your organization map in a customer relationship man-
agement (CRM) tool such as Salesforce or as part of your account plan-
ning documents (jump to Chapter 15 for more on CRM). The key point is 
that to increase business within upper mid-market or large customers, 
you need to develop new relationships, preferably by introduction.
	
✓	Know what the trends are in your customer’s market space, or in 
yours, that may provide opportunity for new business. If everyone in 
the customer’s industry is getting into, say, enterprise-wide collabora-
tion tools, or dealing with new legislation or end-of-life product, maybe 
that gives you an opportunity. If your other customers are starting to 
engage your company to help with some new, innovative initiative, you 
should be aware of that and share it with your customer.
	
✓	Know the right questions to ask each customer. Good knowledge of the 
customer’s business is the starting point for figuring out what may be 
next on its mind. If you can pose questions that get the customer think-
ing, or that lead to a discussion of new opportunities, that’s awesome.
	
✓	Be willing to share information that’s useful to your customer, even 
if the information is of no direct benefit to your firm. The perfect 
account manager is a trusted advisor and trusted advisors do what’s 
good for the customer, not for themselves. In the end it pays off.

 Chapter 17: Joining Together to Maximize Business and Customer Value
No one is better at these tasks than top salespeople. If you have folks like 
that, good on you. Use them to share their best practices with you to hone 
your account management skills. If your salespeople need to up their game, 
joint training sessions are really beneficial.
Table 17-3 shows what these training sessions can consist of, giving topics to 
cover and approaches that work. Make these sessions active and collabora-
tive, not just boring sessions on what people should be doing.
Table 17-3	
Account Management Training
What to Do
How to Do It
Account 
planning
Share the format of the account planning template (Figure 17-1) 
and your revenue goal for the year/quarter. Fill in what you know 
today and share it with another account manager or salesper-
son, who should ask questions. More details and ideas come 
out of a paired discussion (two heads are better than one). Fill 
out the rest as homework.
Customer 
review process
The key to developing and growing a customer is the customer 
review process (at the most formal level) and all the weekly 
or monthly opportunities to talk informally with the customer 
about how things are going. Many account managers have 
difficulty asking for anything, so carry out paired role play 
around the customer review process (Figure 16-1): make sure 
to include questions that ask for a case study, a testimonial, a 
reference, a referral or even just what the contact is going to 
focus on when this project is done. One person plays the cus-
tomer, the other the account manager. Then switch.
Share best 
practices in 
customer 
profiling
Have team members share their favorite sources of informa-
tion about customers, industries, staff changes and so on. 
Agree how to capture and share such information as the cus-
tomer moves through the lifecycle. Decide also where to keep 
this information.
Win/loss and 
status/deliver-
able meetings
Sales and account managers should share how they capture 
information to improve performance at different stages in the 
lifecycle. For example, for salespeople, the win/loss interview 
tells them what they did well and where they can improve. For 
account managers, they often find out at status meetings, or 
when a deliverable is in review by the customer, or during that 
customer review process.
Best practices
Get examples of best practices from team members, such as 
an action they took or information they used to get a result 
with a customer.

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
	
Sales and account management should get in a room together once a month if 
possible. Account managers benefit from seeing how salespeople are comfort-
able talking about opportunities, budgets and asking for the business.
	
In case you’re wondering, salespeople do account planning too, except that 
the ‘customer’ is still a ‘prospect’ and no actual work is being done yet. Even 
so, salespeople know that profiling the customer in some depth is one of 
their keys to success. They may use the CRM to gather the information, but if 
they’re not researching the customer fully – well, they should be!
Thinking about monthly, quarterly 
and annual reviews
When you have an account plan (or a number of them), it needs first to get 
put into action and second to periodically get reviewed and refreshed. Set up 
a regular meeting schedule to provide a forum for account plan reviews:
	
✓	Monthly meeting: To look at achievements from the prior month and 
plan for the next month.
	
✓	Quarterly meeting: To review the past quarter and plan for the next 
one, making any necessary adjustments to the existing plan.
	
✓	Annual meeting: Does account planning for the next year.
Owners and management, marketing, sales and delivery team members may 
want to attend and contribute (or learn). Account managers should take 
turns to discuss their accounts.
Playing around with roles
When working with a group of account man-
agers in a software training organization, the 
discussion quickly moved from the customer 
experience to some role play on asking cus-
tomer contacts who else in their organization 
may benefit from the training.
After two or three role-play attempts with a 
co-worker, account managers started to say 
that they felt more comfortable about asking 
for introductions. The next week, an account 
manager called me to say that he’d been intro-
duced to a contact much higher up in the cus-
tomer’s organization and they were discussing 
making the training a corporate standard for all 
departments.

As an account manager, you use these meetings to see whether you’re:
	
✓	Delivering on the revenue goals.
	
✓	Expanding your relationships in the customer.
	
✓	Expanding the people or departments in the customer with whom you’re 
doing business.
	
✓	Getting good customer reviews and acting on the feedback.
	
✓	Feeding back information to people in your company: marketing, sales 
and delivery (see the next section).
Bringing Delivery to the Feedback Party
Account managers aren’t an island – they’re surrounded by a delivery team, 
some of whom may be future account managers. Think of your team as feet 
on the street and use them to the advantage of your company. What’s the 
significance of having a capable account management and delivery team? 
In the end, the work on the ground with the customer is at the heart of your 
business, so in this section I look at leveraging your whole team to deliver on 
business growth.
Raj goes large!
Raj runs a software development company and 
believed that his team had previously underper-
formed. Growth seemed to be just a matter of 
luck rather than planning.
I worked with Raj and his team to facilitate their 
annual planning cycle. During the planning 
process, we uncovered a whole new business 
opportunity, which his firm could easily posi-
tion with its customers and potentially double 
revenue from each client. With a plan in hand, 
team members became alert to what they 
needed to find out, what they should act on and 
how to expand their customer’s value using this 
new idea.
At the end of the first quarter, one account man-
ager had three contract extensions and was 
starting to see new revenue coming in, above 
her original account plan. The next quarter’s 
plan included getting every customer to sign-up 
for the extended service and to have sales dis-
cuss the opportunity with new prospects during 
the sales process. Major win for Raj’s company!

Spreading delivery’s tentacles 
into the market
When the delivery team is doing its job, staff members are looking to be 
the best they can at delivering the customer work flawlessly, quickly and 
efficiently.
	
Although you may want to bill customers every hour in the week to maximize 
your revenue, in the end you’re caught out if a competitor does it faster (and 
as result, cheaper).
Where delivery really has the advantage in business development is that it 
works right at the coal face. The team hears what the customer is saying, 
sees what issues come up and gets to know the hopes and dreams of your 
customers. It gathers intelligence at a whole different level, like an octopus, 
reaching out into different aspects of your customer’s business and feeling 
for what’s there.
Gathering new ideas and best practices
Each delivery team has its own perspective on its customer(s) and from 
the work it has done with prior ones. Somehow, you have to aggregate that 
knowledge into a collection of valuable experiences and information that you 
can use for your business.
	
The following is what’s of highest value to you:
	
✓	Information about your direct impact on the customer’s business. This 
information tells you whether your services are relevant, whether you’re 
delivering them the right way and whether they’re providing the right 
value that the customer is more than happy to pay for. This information 
allows you to improve constantly how you serve your customers to maxi-
mize your value to them.
	
✓	Information about whether customers love working with you. If so, 
maybe they want you to extend your services to encompass a little 
more – to go a little further. Think carefully about whether you can do as 
good a job with extended services, and if you can, go for it. If the plan is 
a decent one, you should be able to cross-sell this extension to many of 
your other customers as well.
	
✓	Information about when you see a whole new trend in the market-
place. It may be a threat (such as the fact that your service is being 
replaced by newer approaches) or a whole new opportunity for your 
company. Your customers may be seeing the same trend and they’ll 
share with you what they’re thinking. Take their views seriously – 
they’re the ones with the check book.

 Chapter 17: Joining Together to Maximize Business and Customer Value
Figure out how to collect customer intelligence and how to use it and com-
bine it with your own ideas. If it doesn’t get captured, it typically gets lost 
and forgotten.
Ensuring that sales learns from delivery
When account management is a robust discipline in your company, sales 
has a lot to learn from delivery. Delivery is all about making things happen 
in reality – having customers achieve their goals, delivering the work as 
perfectly as possible, managing the ups and downs of a services engage-
ment, and keeping things on track and on budget are significant skills.
Now, I’m the last to suggest that salespeople are universally sloppy, but some 
of them really are! They want to be performing in front of a prospect, sharing 
how great your company is and the excellent results the customers will get if 
they just sign on the dotted line. What salespeople often don’t do so well is 
meticulous record-keeping. The evidence is that top-performing salespeople 
(and account managers) do pay careful attention to note-keeping.
I discuss the downside of inadequate record-keeping in Chapter 16, which 
covers handover from sales to delivery and how to make that go smoothly. 
When sales gets a chance to collaborate with delivery, it can benefit hugely, 
especially by examining areas that don’t work as well as they should, such as 
a weak kick-off or a messy completion.
Sales also needs first-hand understanding of the real value of your services 
to the customer, even if they’re specific to that customer. If that value gets 
captured (shared across the team, written up as a testimonial or case study, 
quantified and qualified), account managers can use that information in their 
selling.
	
A great case study coming to you in an email isn’t the same as a verbal com-
munication by the account manager and other team members about the differ-
ence they made to that customer.
Making delivery feel valued
Sometimes, the delivery folks feel like the workhorses of the company. 
They’re heads-down every day, sometimes working long hours to get the job 
done on time.

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
When you enrol your delivery team in the idea that they are your frontline 
intelligence army and that what they uncover is priceless, you can elevate 
their perceived importance (and perhaps find a way to compensate them 
for what they may see as an off-hours effort). Plus, when the whole team 
(marketing, salespeople and account managers) places high value on using 
what delivery says, the pivotal role of delivery becomes evident to everyone.
	
No one talks to the customers as often or as deeply about the real issues as 
the delivery team. Make the most of their input.

or most businesses, expansion is the name of the game. Whether your 
focus is a little more revenue every year, a path to a great exit by selling 
your company or you’re into world domination, growth matters. When a busi-
ness grows, employees experience a thriving, dynamic and exciting environ-
ment; if a business is static or in decline, things feel turgid, because in essence 
business is a game and you play games to win.
I write a great deal in this book about how to attract, acquire, retain and 
leverage your customers, but business development involves much more 
than just the next customer, and then the next, and then the next. . . . For 
example, Chapter 17 describes approaches for a first, next, next strategy, 
where each successive customer you acquire builds on the last and things 
get easier.
In contrast, this chapter looks at growth from the point of view of verticals: 
the specific industries your customers are in and your value to their specific 
situations, given that industry context. I discuss the importance of verticals 
and whether going vertical is suitable for you. Also, I show how to leverage 
your customer-management success with one customer throughout the 
vertical.
I use a variety of target verticals as examples, but my thoughts apply to any 
vertical, so you can translate the ideas to your own business.

‘The Only Way Is Up!’ Understanding 
Why Verticals Matter
In this section, I explain what verticals are, why they have such potential for 
some firms, whether you should join the fun and what customers within a 
vertical want from you. You can use this section to start your assessment of 
whether verticals would be good for you to pursue.
	
Here are a couple of definitions:
	
✓	Verticals: Companies that are in the same line of business, for exam-
ple Retail, which can be subdivided into sub-verticals like Apparel, 
Footwear, Grocery and so on.
	
✓	Horizontals: Similar to verticals, horizontals represent a line of busi-
ness, but one that cuts across verticals. For example, Manufacturing is a 
particularly broad category and apparel manufacturing is hugely differ-
ent from electronics or convenience food manufacturing.
Two connected dimensions significantly impact the value of your company in 
the market:
	
✓	Specialization: Although you may be tempted to try to be everything to 
everyone, that approach opens you up to extensive competition and to 
being mediocre in some areas of delivery. Staying narrow and going deep 
is much more valuable – like drilling for oil.
	
✓	Verticalization: As a special case of specialization, serving one or just a 
few verticals makes your offer much more valuable than a general offer 
from your competitors.
To discover more about verticals, see the sidebar ‘‘River deep, mountain 
high’: Verticals and horizontals’.
Figure 18-1 shows an extract from a SIC code table that indicates categories of 
specific industries. Each major vertical and all the subdivisions are shown as 
two, three or four-digit codes, dependent on how granular you’re getting (see 
also siccode.com/en/pages/industry-codes). A NAICS (North American 
Industry Classification System) code table is also available and similarly used 
to categorize companies (see www.census.gov/eos/www/naics).
	
When you’re collecting company data for business-development purposes, 
make sure that you get the SIC code for each company. Doing so allows you 
to segment your database by industry and therefore tailor specific market-
ing campaigns with information that’s relevant to the vertical. Check out 
Chapter 11 for more on building your prospect database.

 Chapter 18: Standing Tall To Get More Customers: Vertical Industries
‘River deep, mountain high’: 
Verticals and horizontals
A vertical conjures up an image of something 
that goes from top to bottom, like a column on a 
building, as opposed to side to side, or horizon-
tal, like the sidewalk outside your home.
If you think of the marketplace as a rectangle, 
you can divide it into columns where each 
represents a slice of the marketplace – a spe-
cific industry, such as agriculture, healthcare or 
education (see the following minitable, which 
is, of course, far from complete):
As a wrinkle, some categories that look like ver-
ticals, such as manufacturing, are really more 
like horizontals. Manufacturing companies do 
some of the same things whatever product 
they’re manufacturing. They also inherit certain 
constraints and opportunities from the vertical 
for which they’re manufacturing (for example, a 
pharmaceutical company has to be concerned 
about the FDA, HIIPA and the Affordable Care 
Act), so manufacturing ‘cuts across’ verticals 
as shown above. You get the picture.
To look at the wide variety of verticals, down-
load a standard industrial classification 
(SIC) code table and check out the diversity 
(Figure 18-1 shows an extract from such a list).
The SIC categories are broad slices – for exam-
ple, a healthcare insurer (such as Aetna, Cigna 
or United Health) may have different concerns 
from a healthcare provider (such as a hospital). 
How detailed you get in thinking about verticals 
depends on how specific your service is.
Working with verticals makes sense
Customers believe that they’re different, even if you know that they’re not. 
Therefore, they think that vendors that have worked in their space are more 
valuable than ones that haven’t – and they’re right about that.
	
If you’ve gleaned specialized knowledge from working with a company in a 
specific vertical, you’re more valuable to other companies in that vertical. 
When you position your service in their language (words specific to their 
vertical) and you have case studies to show that you know what you’re doing, 
you’re automatically going to rise to the top of their consideration list.
In addition, any work you do for a similar company is essentially ‘repeat-
able’. You have so-called domain knowledge about how the firm’s business 
operates that you don’t have to relearn, so the customer spends less time

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
teaching you. Plus, any distinctive services, know-how or other components 
of your solutions are highly valuable. You may have insights, solution tips 
and tricks to pass on, which make the delivery of your service much more 
cost effective for the customer (and more profitable for you).

Extract of 
a standard

classifica-
tion (SIC) 
code table.
You can also take on board new customers much more quickly, guide them 
more effectively and streamline your services from your prior learning. Over 
time, you can become the go-to vendor for your service in that vertical. Just 
think how much you’d like to hear the following statement about your firm: ‘Do 
you need a product development plan for your new wearable heart-monitoring 
device? If so, go to Jim at PQR Inc. His company specializes in product design 
for new biomedical devices.’ Gives you a nice warm feeling inside, doesn’t it?
Identifying your verticals: Is going 
vertical right for you?
	
To start deciding whether to pursue a vertical strategy for your firm, examine 
your current client list and look for any natural candidates:

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
337
 Chapter 18: Standing Tall To Get More Customers: Vertical Industries
	
✓	Do you have more than one customer in any given vertical? Do you have 
compelling customer case studies, testimonials and references?
	
✓	Have you done any work for customers that had vertical-specific deliv-
erables, namely where your work directly impacted your customers’ 
results, cost reduction, avoidance of risk or the like?
	
✓	Have you needed to acquire a deep understanding of your clients’ spe-
cific business functions compared to other verticals?
If the answer to any of or all these questions is yes, you may have a case for 
going vertical.
When you’ve identified two or three candidate verticals, you can start to 
dig deeper into what may make your offer particularly compelling in those 
verticals.
	
As with any other business-development ideas, look and think before you 
jump. Carrying out research along the lines I give in Chapter 5 is a great idea, 
before you invest in marketing and selling into a vertical.
Before you finally fix on your verticals, see Table 18-1, which presents ideas 
for characteristics of verticals that would make them good candidates.
Table 18-1	
Characteristics of Compelling Verticals
If the Vertical . . . 
Has a wide enough customer base to support, say, 20 percent of your business, or 
more.
Has other associated verticals that are similar in nature that you can also embrace 
without too much of a stretch.
Is well represented in your geography and/or in other regions, such that you can 
gain some traction in specific markets.
Is thriving – preferably advancing in terms of growth, new technologies.
Has challenges that your service can resolve.
Requires specialized knowledge to enter into as an employee (for example, requires 
specialist degrees or prior experience, or you commonly see people moving from 
one firm to another within the vertical).
Is likely to be current for a considerable time and/or you can continue to develop 
your offer to keep pace with the needs of the vertical.
	
The bottom line is that you want the vertical to have promise of future growth 
for your company, and not to be in a state of decline.

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
While you’re about it, check what the competition looks like. If a vertical has 
a promising opening for services, someone’s probably already dominating 
that market. Make sure that you can compete with more advanced thinking, 
better technologies or by producing better results.
I’m sure that you can name certain verticals where their sphere of work 
simply evaporated, went into serious decline and/or is threatened by some 
upstart idea. Newspapers, film photography, on-premises server farms, hard-
copy printing, books and CDs, the list is endless. Alongside those are new 
and upcoming categories of online services, geo-specific services and data 
(that rely on knowing where something is on the map), big data analytics 
(crunching the huge amounts of data available today for business insights), 
hybrid vehicles, video telecommunications and live media streaming.
	
If a vertical is having to update itself, or is trading in the latest, progressive 
trend, make sure that you can guide your customer to the next important 
thing it needs to be considering in your area of expertise to help it stay cur-
rent and leapfrog the competition. You need to be up-to-date too.
Listening to what customers say 
about their vertical
If you look at the career of a friend whose firm has stayed within a given 
vertical, you may wonder why it did so, instead of veering off in some other 
direction.
Some people who work in verticals bring highly specialized skills and knowl-
edge to their jobs. Your firm also has specialized knowledge that’s vertically 
based – after all, every customer you have is in a vertical and some of their 
knowledge rubs off on your team. This section helps you think about the 
specialized knowledge you may need to be even more valuable to specific 
verticals.
Here’s an example to illustrate. Imagine a procurement officer who’s working 
for a hospital group. When a new hospital is looking to fill such a role with a 
new employee, here are some of the sorts of things that person would need 
to know:
	
✓	Who the suppliers are, where to source from and how to negotiate.
	
✓	Knowledge of products and technical goods, such as X-ray equipment, 
pediatric equipment, specialist supplies and so on.
	
✓	The nature of supplier systems and procurement systems.

 Chapter 18: Standing Tall To Get More Customers: Vertical Industries
	
✓	Knowledge of procurement procedures, authorization workflows, budget 
approvals, quality controls, returns and refunds.
	
✓	How to project manage the fitting out of a new hospital so that all the 
procurement is done in time.
The first requirement for such a job is often ‘specific hospital or solid health-
care procurement experience’. Someone working in vehicle parts procure-
ment for a chain of motor vehicle dealerships wouldn’t have the specialized 
knowledge for how to fit a hospital.
	
Imagine that you’re a professional services firm that helps organizations 
design, set up and operationalize their procurement processes. Consider 
how easy or difficult breaking into the hospital arena would be if you’d never 
worked with a hospital before.
Clearly, it wouldn’t be easy. Like a prospective employee, you need prior 
experience. You may even need a specialist team member from that industry 
(usually at high cost).
	
Often, firms break into a vertical by luck. I had a huge break into the automo-
tive arena many years ago, when a vendor let a major motor manufacturer 
down and I just happened to get introduced by a business contact of mine. 
I did tens of millions of business in that industry over the next decade. Selling 
services into that vertical became easier and easier because I discovered how 
it worked.
Customers in a specific vertical have good reason for wanting your firm to 
bring some specialized knowledge with you – knowledge about their sphere 
of work and about your own and how the two are related. They also may be 
looking for:
	
✓	Specialized certifications
	
✓	Specialized quality control
	
✓	Legal knowledge
	
✓	Familiarity with complex processes
	
✓	Knowledge of the supply chain (how products and services are brought 
to market)
When you can demonstrate that you have the knowledge and expertise in the 
vertical, you’re highly valued, you beat out the competition more easily and 
you can often charge more. Nice!

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
Leveraging Your Knowledge 
for Vertical Success
After you pick a vertical to focus on and have completed your background 
research (see the preceding section), you need to redefine your offer to fit your 
chosen vertical. People working in any vertical think that they’re ‘different’ – a 
fair point of view, because clearly differences exist between, say, car dealerships 
and colleges. In this section, I describe isolating the differences between firms 
in different verticals, adapting your experience to appeal to a vertical, digging 
deep or stretching wide and assessing your readiness to go vertical.
Where firms pull off ‘going vertical’ they often close deals faster and at a 
higher rate, get better referrals, become ever more expert and valuable. It 
can be the making of a services business.
Understanding similarities and 
differences between verticals
Despite different business contexts from vertical to vertical, much about how 
you deliver your service is independent of the customer’s vertical. Make sure 
that you fully define your offer using Chapter 5.
	
Compare a recent customer from outside your chosen vertical with one inside 
it. How much of your service was delivered exactly the same and what aspects 
had to be done differently?
I expect that this little bit of research shows that you have to rethink 
your delivery approach to encompass the vertical knowledge you have 
or need to acquire. Preferably do that before you start trying to get new 
customers. You don’t want to be doing that sort of thing on the way to a 
customer meeting!
	
Assume that you’re an industrial architect. Compare designing a hospital 
with designing an automotive parts production line. Table 18-2 takes a look 
at what’s the same and what’s different about customer interactions, the 
knowledge required and how you deliver your service. By the way, I’m no 
architect, so the table is by no means intended to be a definitive answer for 
architects!

sion, budget approvals, financing 
options, hire contractors, supervise 
construction
Specific local and regional construc-
tion restrictions, laws, union/workforce 
constraints and so on
Breaking down your services experience 
from a vertical perspective
Everything you know about how to be successful with customers is still valid; 
you just need to think about how to layer the vertical knowledge onto your 
best practices.
	
For example, if your typical process includes a kick-off meeting and then a 
series of discovery meetings, you’re probably using questionnaires to make 
sure that you’re gathering all the right information. Are those questionnaires 
okay in a generic form, or do you need to adapt to include vertical-specific 
questions? In most cases, the answer is yes, you do need to add a vertical 
flavor to your questionnaires.
Use your knowledge of working in the vertical previously and incorporate 
your experiences into a modified delivery methodology or process so that 
you can expand your team and do the work really well as your new custom-
ers sign up.

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
	
If possible, test your ideas with someone from the industry: perhaps a prior 
customer or someone who works in that vertical can validate your process. At 
the very least, that person can give you cultural insights into how businesses 
in that vertical work.
Finding gold in them there vertical hills
	
The narrower and more specialized the vertical, the more valuable your spe-
cialized services become. You have to choose whether your service lends 
itself to going wide with a vertical or whether going narrow and deep is better. 
Say that you have an appointment-setting solution that you’ve customized for 
doctor’s offices by adding a whole bunch of practice management features. Do 
you stick with doctor’s offices (stay narrow) or can you easily repurpose your 
solution to dentists, chiropractors or psychiatrists (go wide)? How about hos-
pitals or veterinary practices (go wider still)?
As another example, e-commerce emerged in the late 1990s and has exploded. 
Lots of opportunities exist to offer services to companies that want to go 
online, but lots of competition too. Like manufacturing, e-commerce is more 
like a horizontal than a vertical: e-tailers have to provide lots of common 
things.
But some areas of e-commerce, such as selling alcohol online, are highly 
specialized. If you choose to be an expert in the complex business of selling 
wine online, with all the local restrictions, tax implications and authorita-
tive sources of information, you’ll probably find more gold than if you offer 
general e-commerce websites (which are becoming highly commoditized, in 
other words, it’s a price-driven market). People have already come out with 
solutions for wine-specific sites. That doesn’t mean you can’t do well – you 
just have to find the prestigious customers who want to stand out from the 
crowd and need your expert advice.
Whether new technology is rampant in your space or not, you have to keep 
on top of the latest thinking.
	
Look carefully at the market potential of your vertical offer. If you can add 
a few customers by positioning a vertical offer, go for it. Sometimes it pays 
to be opportunistic. If, however, you’re looking to increase your valuation 
for a potential acquisition, you want to make sure that your offer has a long 
lifespan and is going to be worth the investment in time, staff and geographic 
reach.

 Chapter 18: Standing Tall To Get More Customers: Vertical Industries
Checking whether you’re ready 
to go vertical
When you have an outline of how you’re going to deliver your service to ver-
tical customers, what the value is to them and what your project is going to 
look like, you’re nearly ready to turn to the marketing and sales effort (in the 
next section).
Before you do that though, assess your readiness by taking a look at Chapters 6 
and 7. Like any other area of your business, you want to be clear about your 
goals and how to achieve them. Get feedback from your professional advisors 
as follows:
	
✓	Legal: You may need a slightly different contract format.
	
✓	Accounting: What are its perceptions of this market segment?
	
✓	Friends and family/trusted advisors: Get their take on your ideas for 
verticals. They work in different industries and can give you a perspec-
tive beyond your own. They can also advise you if you’re going too far: 
spreading yourself too thin with a wide vertical or going too narrow 
and becoming so niche focused, you can’t branch out.
	
Beware of contracts that may preclude you from working with another com-
pany in the same vertical. If exclusions are necessary, make sure that the 
customer defines a specific list of companies that it doesn’t want you to work 
with, namely their direct competitors, and then only if your service gives the 
customer a competitive advantage. If your service is general, such as legal 
advice on healthcare law, don’t accept exclusions. But if a custom marketing 
strategy is the one that helps your customer sell more, you may have to accept 
some exclusions.
Designing and Executing 
Vertical Campaigns
I cover much of what you need to go to market in general in Chapters 10 and 
11. You just need to repeat the planning process for your marketing with the 
specific vertical in mind.

Part V: Managing Your Customers for Business Success 
Writing vertically based 
promotional materials
	
As with any good marketing materials, map out the buyer’s journey. Understand 
the roles you’ll be interacting with and how they relate to each other:
	
✓	Who’s the typical budget holder/decision-maker?
	
✓	What areas of pain is the organization experiencing?
	
✓	How do you tackle those pain points?
	
✓	What results do you produce?
	
Try to get one or two vertical case studies done: they’re convincing to buyers. 
Don’t forget to ensure that you have materials for sales to use too. Plus, make 
sure that the language you use in your materials is accurate for the industry: 
create a glossary of industry abbreviations for internal use. Perhaps consider 
a training session for your employees to ‘launch’ a new vertical initiative.
Getting your vertical message out there
	
Beyond the direct buyers, make sure that you understand the organization 
structure of your targets, what the pecking order is and who you need to 
influence.
Vendors often get pulled in because the CEO saw an article about a risk that 
his company needs to take care of or an opportunity it mustn’t miss. Ask 
yourself the following questions and add these channels into your marketing 
activities:
	
✓	Where are these influencers spending their time?
	
✓	What are they reading?
	
✓	Where are they networking?
	
Beyond your usual channels, try to get your message in front of industry 
experts – bloggers, journalists and other influencers who report on industry 
trends, problems and solutions. Consider vertical-specific trade shows – you 
may be the only vendor of your type attending them and so could make a 
killing.

Mutual Benefit
In This Chapter

▶	Being happy alone or searching for partners
▶	Creating the foundation for a great partnership
Y
 
oung or small companies that are struggling to survive often try to hog 
all the work, keep their costs down and stop others from encroaching on 
(what they perceive to be) their business. Although superficially understand-
able, this strategy is shortsighted for all sorts of reasons. After all, you’re willing 
to use your network to spread the word about your company and recommend 
people and companies in your network to others (you scratch my back . . . ). So 
why not consider doing the same thing where you spot a real, mutual benefit. 
That’s what partnerships make available to you.
This chapter discusses partnerships as a route to significant business growth. I 
detail the main types, explain the importance of sticking to your core strengths 
at all times and supply some high-level considerations to bear in mind when 
you’re weighing up whether partnering is going to be good for your company – 
or not.
Partnerships can bring you leads, credibility, access to a wider customer list 
or additional product or services capabilities that you don’t have. Whatever 
the benefit, your business development practices (and results) shift when 
you partner well.
Just to be clear, I’m not talking about businesses that are founded as partner-
ships, as is typical of law, accounting and consulting firms, among others. In 
such businesses, a group of equals owns a part of the business and shares in 
the profits.

Part VI: Making Influential Friends: Partnerships 
My definition of the kinds of partnerships I cover in this chapter (and in 
Chapter 20 on making partnerships successful after you take the plunge) is 
as follows:
A partnership is a relationship between two business entities sharing a 
common goal.
Considering the Types of 
Partnership Available
You may think that a partnership is a partnership is a partnership. If so, all I 
can say is, does only one type of human partnership exist? Not at all, which 
is why in this section I describe some of the more common forms of partner-
ship into which services firms enter.
Table 19-1 gives broad definitions of the different types of partnerships that 
may be appropriate for your company, as well as an example of each type.
Table 19-1	
Partnership Types, Descriptions and Examples
Partnership 
Type
Description
Example
Channel 
partner
Where the two companies enter 
into a formal agreement. One has 
a product or service that it wants 
to provide to customers and it 
needs other companies to help 
make that happen. In other words, 
one company is treating the other 
as a ‘channel sales’ partner and 
both benefit from the relationship.
Eric’s business installs monitor-
ing equipment at oil-extraction 
locations. His channel partner 
provides the equipment and 
software and sends him leads. 
Eric introduces his clients to the 
opportunity of onsite monitoring 
as a cost-reduction/quality-
control advantage.
Referral 
partner
A step above your business 
contacts and informal support. 
A referral partner is a company 
to whom you can send leads and 
who can send leads to you. It 
may be entirely informal, or have 
a referral contract where either 
party gets a fee or commission on 
the referred work.
Chris’s company does process-
improvement consulting for 
manufacturing, including sales 
and customer-service optimiza-
tion. Her friend, Mandy, uses 
Salesforce (a sales team tool) 
and has an implementation com-
pany that customizes Salesforce 
for clients. The two firms have 
a referral agreement that pays 
each a percentage on referrals to 
each other’s clients. It works well 
because they’re tackling different 
aspects of the same problem.

Example
Working 
partner
Implies that the two compa-
nies work together within the 
same customer organization, 
symbiotically or even under a 
common contract to deliver a 
single ­project or set of services. 
Working partners often act as 
sub-contractors (that is, your 
partner does work on contracts 
that you have with your custom-
ers, but you’re the ‘prime’ – you 
own the contact and the partner 
is ‘under’ you); who’s the sub-
contractor on any given project 
can vary.

scale events for major brands

people or more. Its design partner, 
Bridget’s company, does all the 
offline and online design for the 
events. When one of Bridget’s 
clients wants to do a trade show, 
she asks Raquel to help.
Alliance
A form of partnership where two 
companies agree that a major 
business benefit exists in defining 
a deep working arrangement for a 
specific purpose, such as launch-
ing a new product or penetrating 
a new market. This type is most 
common between larger compa-
nies of roughly equal size. I don’t 
spend time on alliances – suffice 
to say that they’re complex legal 
relationships and if someone 
wants one with you, you’ll know.

A prior colleague, Steven, has

funded by their two companies, to 
develop and bring the software to

Sticking to What You Do Best
As you work through the stages of business development (and through this 
book), you build up a vision of your company as a well-focused business that 
provides good value to its customers and has a clear story to tell the market-
place. Knowing your firm well is central to whether you should keep yourself 
to yourself or reach out to others.
You know that focus is important. You focus on being the best at what you 
do, on the right kinds of customers that are a good fit for you, on your geog-
raphy, specific verticals (see Chapter 18) or size of customer.

Part VI: Making Influential Friends: Partnerships 
In this section I cover deciding whether to stick to your plan – and nothing’s 
wrong with that at all – or whether to widen your business offer.
Keeping to your set path
Imagine that you get tempted to expand your services. Perhaps a customer 
you’ve worked with for a while and who really trusts you asks whether you 
can help with ‘another matter’. Or an employee has read about the latest 
thing and thinks you should ‘get into it’. Or a potential investor wants to ‘do 
its own thing’ inside your company.
None of these ideas are necessarily bad, but assume for the moment that 
they don’t align with your business strategy, so you decide not to pursue 
them. You refer your customer to someone else that you know can help. You 
tell your employee that her idea is really interesting, but that the company is 
focused on a different direction. You decline the investment.
	
What you’re doing when you make these decisions is keeping to your chosen 
path – maintaining focus. Provided you’re really confident about those deci-
sions and doing well in business terms, good on you.
Going deep not wide
Sometimes certain business situations arise where an opportunity to expand 
your reach through formal partner relationships is a good idea. Indeed, I’d go 
so far as to say that most successful and larger services firms used partner-
ships as a strategy to secure their growth. Without them, they wouldn’t have 
been so successful.
	
Any small business is well advised to find ways of deepening its services (that 
is, become more and more expert in a narrow area) rather than widening them 
(that is, adding completely new services, hoping to do better in the market). 
The marketplace has a distinct preference for firms that have a concentration – 
deep expertise that solves knotty customer problems. When you’re small, going 
wide tends to dilute your market reputation, because you become defocused. 
For more on this dilemma, check out Chapter 18.
So what are business owners to do if real opportunities come up that are 
somewhat outside their expertise? Should you dive in and try to take advan-
tage or would a partnership be better?

Think of situations you’ve been in recently where you were tempted to launch 
into something new and compare them with the first column in Table 19-2. 
Then consider the choices you had before you – to go it alone or to partner. 
You don’t have to agree with me, but expanding services and/or partnering are 
strategic decisions, so you want to consider carefully what each might mean 
for your firm.

Now that you’ve fin-

Yes. Create a support

the bother of ‘small’

working partners with 
other specialties.

though, that partnering takes real effort. Spending some time thinking it 
through can save you a whole load of time and wasted effort later.

Part VI: Making Influential Friends: Partnerships 
Traveling Alone or Partnering Up
The question is, are you going to stay single or get married? The difference 
between marriage and partnering is that you don’t have to be monogamous. 
You can have a number of partners at once, including a mix of different types. 
What marriage and partnerships do have in common is that you want to look 
before you leap, and after you’re in you have to work at it.
In this section I cover what you need to consider when making this decision: 
including when not to partner and, if you decide you want to try it, projecting 
what a partnership would look like for your firm.
‘We belong together’: Finding 
reasons to partner – or not
Why should you partner? What advantages can you expect from doing some-
thing that’s going to take attention, energy and investment?
	
Think of partnering as a way of increasing your capacity for success. When 
you partner with another company of whatever size (and the partnership is 
well founded), think of it as if you just grew your firm and its capacity to reach 
out to and serve the market. In fact, in the best partnerships, the sum of the 
parts is greater that the whole. Together, you’re stronger and more powerful 
than you are on your own.
Here are a few key questions to ask about a potential partnership:
	
✓	Why are you considering partnering? What’s the context for the part-
nership and what sort of business case would be necessary so that the 
partnership makes sense for both parties?
	
✓	Is it just opportunistic? Is it to meet one customer’s need, or is it aligned 
with defined growth strategy? Either way is fine, but you need to be 
clear, which in turn helps you structure the right partner agreement.
	
✓	Would this partnership align around common goals? Can you find a 
partner alike enough in philosophies, values, services, methods and 
pricing?
	
✓	Do both firms broadly serve the same markets? Or can you find a part-
ner who operates in markets that you want to get into?
	
✓	What type of partnership would make sense: referral, channel, work-
ing or alliance? Check out the types in the earlier Table 19-1.

 Chapter 19: Seeking Partners for Mutual Benefit
You have to consider whether the effort and investment is worth the results 
you get from the partnership.
To bring about financial advantage, both parties need to be willing to invest 
in the partnership and undertake some mutual or joint activities that drive a 
result. The situation is exactly the same as for your own business: you can’t 
just set up your nameplate, sit behind your desk and wait for business to 
show up. In fact, you can use a lot of the material in this book to consider 
how to strategize for and implement an effective partnership. Chapter 20, for 
example, gives a quick guide to creating a successful partnership.
So why would you choose not to partner? The bottom line is everything. If 
partnering activities don’t lead to new business, directly or indirectly, part-
nering not worthwhile.
	
If you’ve ever been involved in an unsuccessful partnership, try to estimate 
how much time or other resources you spent on the effort. Where else could 
you have spent that money? Unfortunately, a lot of partnerships go this way 
because both parties lack a commitment to make something happen. If the 
opportunity is a reality and not just pie in the sky, two good businesses work-
ing on something together produce a result.
If you can’t even take a stab at the value you’ll get out of the partnership, 
don’t go into it until you can, which may take a few joint conversations to 
clarify the goals, plan and investment.
	
Beyond that, don’t get into a new partnership if:
	
✓	You’re desperate for business, unless by some miracle your partner is 
bringing you an immediate deal. Desperation doesn’t make for objec-
tivity and you need to be objective.
	
✓	Your resources are already really stretched. In other words, you, or 
someone relatively senior in your organization, have/has no time or 
energy to work on this relationship.
	
✓	You’re financially stretched right now (that is, cash flow is tight). 
Relationships take investment and your focus should probably be on 
getting the cash in and building a financial cushion.
	
✓	You have one or more new strategic initiatives on the go that are 
important to you. Again, unless the opportunity’s immediate, wait a 
quarter or two and reopen discussion at that point. You don’t look any 
the worse from being clear about your priorities – quite the contrary.
One thing’s for sure – when you start working with partners, it impacts how 
your business operates. That’s why you need to be cautious and thorough 
before you proceed.

In the end, nothing focuses the mind like putting a deal on the table. If you 
have an opportunity that you want to offer to or share with someone, you’ll 
be amazed how quickly the partnership can come to life. By contrast, a lot of 
partnership discussions can be hot air: polite, even enthusiastic, but still hot 
air. Unless and until a financial advantage exists for both parties, it signifies 
nothing. Even if an immediate opportunity does show up, you’re better to be 
prepared instead of being carried away by enthusiasm.
‘Picture this’: Considering your 
business with partners
Like any relationship, partnerships have their upsides and downsides. Enjoy 
the upsides and make sure that you’re willing to put up with the downsides.
Acquiring new partners is like having one or two additional demanding cus-
tomers to please. New partners bring new contracts to manage (between the 
partners), new things to do in sales and marketing, new administrative tasks 
and even new ways of delivering your services. You may also expand your 
geographic reach and be traveling more. You may have to invest in training 
for your staff, so that they can team more effectively with your new partner.
	
Imagine what having a significant new partner would look like. Check out the 
sidebar ‘The ups and downs of partnerships’ and consider whether a partner-
ship can look like that for you or whether it would be something more modest. 
Is a great opportunity sitting right in front of you that would take more than 
you can do alone? That’s what you’re looking for when thinking about partner-
ing up.
The ups and downs of partnerships
Sally had a great career in software development, 
eventually owning her own company and building 
business solutions for the telecom industry. She 
was fortunate to form a partnership with a major 
telecommunications company and offer her 
software to its channel partners as a preferred 
vendor. Her feet hardly touched the ground. 
She was dealing with a huge organization with 
the marketing, sales and partner management 
resources that she had only dreamed of.
After just a couple of months, however, the 
partner commented that her marketing was 
sub-standard. Sally had to make a big invest-
ment to tackle that problem – and quickly. Life 
got pretty stressful for a while, but the result 
was a great outcome. The effort she and her 
team made generated four new clients a month 
and led to astronomical growth. Without this 
partnership, she would still have been a small 
company, struggling for every deal.

 Chapter 19: Seeking Partners for Mutual Benefit
‘Service Firm WLTM Companion 
for Business Growth’: Finding 
Good Partners
Assuming that you’re considering going the partnership route, you need to 
do a bit of preparatory work before you can go out looking for ‘the one’ – at 
least you won’t have to trawl dating websites, post adverts saying ‘Would 
Like To Meet’, or haunt dimly lit bars. You do, however, need to profile your 
‘possibles’ and decide on your business goals (which is a bit more compli-
cated than desiring ‘long romantic walks on the beach’).
Of course, a lot of partnerships do arise in an ad-hoc way. You meet some-
one and get talking, find that you share common interests and think that a 
partnership may be a good idea. But no matter how random the conversa-
tions seem, you probably wouldn’t be open to the idea unless you’d already 
thought that this kind of partnership would be beneficial for your company. 
Think of it as being like deciding to buy a particular make and model of car – 
suddenly you see them everywhere, where you’d never noticed them before.
	
I had a big influx of business a short while ago and started to consider out-
sourcing some of the work and what kind of a partner I’d want. Within 24 hours, 
I received a LinkedIn request, which I normally accept if the company looks 
interesting, but this one was exactly what I was looking for. Within a month, 
we’d set up a partnership. Would I have paid any attention to this particular 
CEO and his company otherwise? Undoubtedly not. He would just have been 
one of my thousands of LinkedIn connections.
	
Do your thinking in advance, because it opens you up to connections that may 
lead you to the partners you want.
Creating partnership goals
Some partnership types are likely to be more appealing to you than others. 
Some partnerships may be essential to your business and you definitely want 
to prioritize getting those into place. Others may be more like experiments or 
nice-to-haves.
Based on the different types of partnerships that I describe in Table 19-1, 
what sorts of goals can you set up? Table 19-3 gives you a breakdown of what 
to look for and expect from different partnerships and what you may need to 
be ready for.

Table 19-3	
Partnership Types, Goals and Commitments
Partnership Type
Possible Goals
Commitment
Channel partner:
(a) You implement what 
the partner offers.
(b) Your services dove-
tail with the partner’s. 
No referral fee is 
involved.
One party brings leads/
opportunities to the 
other (or it goes both 
ways). Set a percent-
age of your business 
for next year that you’d 
like the partnership to 
produce for you (e.g., 
10 percent of net new 
business).
(a): Requires a com-
mitment. Often fees 
from you to the partner, 
training for your people, 
marketing effort, part-
nership management, 
detailed reporting.
(b): Requires a market-
ing effort to position the 
partner’s services, that 
is, become familiar with 
what it offers, use some 
light collateral from it to 
share with your custom-
ers, follow up diligently 
on opportunities.
Referral partner
A one-way or 
­bi-directional referral 
agreement. The benefit 
is a percentage of the 
sale (typically 5 percent 
or less), so this isn’t 
a big money spinner. 
Consider the minimum 
deal size and how many 
referrals you’re likely to 
generate.
Each party ‘looks’ for 
opportunities for the 
other. This requires 
proactive discussions 
with target customers, 
who typically are in the 
same market segment 
as your firm. Anything 
else has you acting as 
a sales rep for the part-
ner, which isn’t typically 
worth your time.
Working partner
In this partnership, the 
companies work on proj-
ects together (typically 
one leads the engage-
ment and the other is a 
sub-contractor). One-off 
projects are draining, 
but if you can see three 
or four customers a year 
or more, the collabora-
tion becomes much 
easier.
This partnership is simi-
lar to expanding your 
company. The partner’s 
people become part of 
your delivery mecha-
nism, so you have to 
get close to make it 
work. You also often 
have to adapt your 
marketing, sales, deliv-
ery and administrative 
processes.

 Chapter 19: Seeking Partners for Mutual Benefit
When you’ve defined your goals for a potential partnership, make sure that 
they represent a win-win situation, in other words – that both parties benefit. 
Put your goals into your revenue plan and estimate the costs of running the 
partnership and making it successful (more on this topic in Chapter 20).
	
Typically, a partnership takes quite a long time to produce results. Unless both 
parties are ready to go to market with the partnership concept, it takes a while 
for alignment around common goals and how to work together. Given a typical 
sales cycle of three months in services, anticipate a year or more before you 
see revenue. Make sure that you’re willing to wait.
Getting your criteria together: 
Profiling ideal partners
To profile your ideal partners, you need first to get clear what you want and 
second what you’re looking for in the partner.
Things that you want
When you think about your services, what’s lacking in your business or what 
would expand your opportunities?
	
Don’t be tempted to try to meet every sales opportunity, whether it fits your 
services or not, by hiring to fill your capability gaps. Although not out of 
the question, you have to remember that doing so changes the nature and 
dynamic of your business.
Picture an architect firm that spends time understanding its clients’ needs and 
creating great solutions through its design. The firm doesn’t build anything – it 
usually hands over to a contractor and provides supervision to make sure that 
the dream gets realized. If the architect chooses to hire construction managers 
as employees, suddenly the firm is running a whole different sort of business.
Consider the big consulting firms whose sweet spot is to offer strategic 
advice and direction to their clients. In some cases, they’ve the capability to 
implement their strategy, but often they partner with smaller firms who have 
the detailed knowledge to implement a new manufacturing quality control 
process, for example. For the range of consulting that they do, trying to be 
expert in every type of implementation would bog the whole company down.
	
So consider partnering before you opt to start a whole new design depart-
ment, or add an auction department to your real estate business, or build a 
lawnmower repair shop next to your vehicle service center.

Part VI: Making Influential Friends: Partnerships 
Here’s a checklist of things that may be important to you when profiling 
partners. Add to it as necessary for your particular situation:
	
✓	Ensure that you have a strong value proposition for the partnership. 
For example, if you have to turn away a lot of business because you 
don’t have an auction department, estimate how much business you’d 
get for your company if you partner with a local real estate auction firm.
	
✓	You need sufficient knowledge of the specialist area of a potential 
partner to be able to talk about it with confidence. Or you need to 
learn pretty quickly. Often people believe that what the other partner 
does is easy, but their work is no easier than what you do and you need 
to get your head around it.
	
✓	Remember that your future may have a merger or acquisition in it. 
You may choose to focus on partnerships that have that potential.
	
✓	The partnership has to support your overall strategic goals. Partnerships 
are a multi-year relationship, so although you may be slavering over the 
potential of quick wins, the real money comes from a long-term effort. 
Don’t distort your whole business purpose for the sake of some ready 
money.
When you start looking for partners, or evaluating ones that just show up, 
this checklist gives you a strong foundation for assessing whether they’re 
going to pay off for you.
	
Your own network, especially your friends, family and advisors, are your best 
advocates and counsel. Share your thoughts with them and run prospective 
partners by them to see what they think. They can be more objective about 
your business than you can ever be.
Things that you need in a partner
What a good partner looks like and what you need to check for all depends 
on your goals for the partnership.
	
Consider the following ideas:
	
✓	Both firms have complementary skills: Close enough to be useful, but 
with minimal overlaps.
	
✓	The partner is really good at what it does ( just like you): Go for strong 
partners, not so-so performers. If they’re good at what they do, they’re 
usually more organized and effective at partnering too.
	
✓	Find someone with a common customer base with you: For example, 
same types of companies, same size, same geography or same industries.

 Chapter 19: Seeking Partners for Mutual Benefit
	
✓	The partner has resources in the geography you’re interested in: 
These may be local, or you may be trying to break into a new market.
	
✓	The partner is trusted in the marketplace it operates in: No bad 
reports about it, no bad press or complaints to the Better Business 
Bureau. The track record looks good and the website is respectable.
	
✓	The partner is big enough to invest time and money: In marketing, 
training, business changes, extra administration.
	
✓	Both firms are a similar size: Or at least you feel confident that the 
partner won’t swamp you or be too small.
	
✓	You’re creating a win-win situation: The benefits don’t have to be 
50/50, but it can’t all go one way. Even if you pick up commission for a 
referral, that’s not going to be enough for a solid partnership.

Chapter 20
Pursuing Your Plans for a 
Successful Partnership
In This Chapter
▶	Fitting partnerships into the business development lifecycle
▶	Initiating a powerful partnership
▶	Building success together
I
 
n Chapter 19 I describe what you need to consider when deciding whether 
a partnership is right for your company (in the analogy I make, whether 
you want to marry or stay single). Here I assume that you’re following the 
marriage route and need to look around for a suitable spouse. Therefore, this 
chapter lays out the characteristics of a successful partnership and how you 
can create one.
Instead of reiterating all the good business practices I cover throughout this 
book, I highlight some of the unique management communication and team-
work challenges and opportunities that partnerships offer.
If you follow even half of the advice in Chapters 19 and 20, your partnership 
has a much higher chance of success than the average one. Good luck and 
much prosperity.
Locating Partnerships within 
Business Development
As you launch into setting up a partnership and using it to drive maximum 
revenue, you start to experience some of the same parts of the business 
development lifecycle that I cover elsewhere in this book, when I talk about 
the customer experience and business development lifecycle (see Chapters 2 
and 3).

Part VI: Making Influential Friends: Partnerships 
	
Think about your partners as customers, because doing so makes you concen-
trate on setting goals, bringing value to the relationship and getting results. 
What you’re selling is quite different, of course: your ability to create and 
run an effective partnership. If the partner ‘buys’ it, some sort of partnership 
agreement gets signed and you’re off into the delivery stage.
Other aspects of the customer lifecycle are also useful, for example, creat-
ing defined projects (for example, joint marketing activities), avoiding scope 
creep (that is, getting side-tracked), completing powerfully (signing off that a 
task is done) and carrying out a periodic partner review process.
Partnering Up Effectively
Partnerships are all about creating a win-win situation. You achieve your 
objectives, the partner achieves its own and everyone’s happy.
	
Unfortunately a lot of partnerships die on the vine pretty quickly, by and large 
because people want things easy. Building and growing a business takes effort 
(in other words, doing all the ‘business development’ stuff), but with partner-
ships they imagine that the fruit is going to drop off the tree of a beneficent 
partner, right into their laps. Don’t fall for this dangerous delusion: partner-
ships take real work.
In this section I examine what it takes to get from a twinkle in the eye to 
the great partnership benefits and accomplishments: new and exciting cus-
tomers, working alongside other professionals that you respect, increased 
revenue and fulfilled goals. Specifically, I cover becoming familiar with – and 
finding out about – your potential partner, staying realistic and establishing 
shared targets. I also take a quick look at what may be creating problems in a 
partnership that seems to be floundering.
	
I use a working partnership as the fullest example of a partnership. Other 
models (referral or channel partnerships) are a subset of working partnerships 
(you can find definitions in Chapter 19).
In a working partnership, you may be going to go to market together: aligning 
your offers, doing some co-marketing and co-selling, delivering the project as 
a single team and sharing the spoils. I follow that model, but you can adapt it 
easily to any other variant.
Dating: Getting to know each other
In essence, a partnership is created. It doesn’t have a life of its own, at least 
not initially: it is what you say it is.

363
 Chapter 20: Pursuing Your Plans for a Successful Partnership
	
The best partnerships are created at the executive level, or at a minimum are 
sponsored by the executives of the company with full support and enthusi-
asm. Forming a partnership starts with getting round a table and talking – CEO 
to CEO, or a broader group if needed.
	
You need to go into the discussion with what’s important to you clear in 
your mind:
	
✓	Is the potential partner competent at what it does? Does any evidence 
show that it’s at least as good as you are? (If so, great!) In other words, 
you have to pitch each other and buy into a relationship.
	
✓	Be open and honest about what you want from the partnership and the 
potential for producing that result. Is it aligned with your goals?
	
✓	Be equally interested in what the partner wants and the potential it 
sees. Are its goals a good fit for yours? Can you feasibly support its 
goals?
	
✓	Check in with yourself – are you committed to what the potential part-
ner wants as well as to what you want?
	
✓	Are you seeing commitment from the potential partner to go to market, 
together with all that entails?
	
✓	Do you both have the resources and time to make things happen? I 
assume you do, otherwise you shouldn’t be having the conversation, 
but does the potential partner have the same stomach for investment?
	
✓	Can you see real market potential in the partnership?
	
✓	Do you like the potential partner? Do you want to work together?
If the answer to any of these questions is ‘no’, walk away before you waste 
time and energy pretending the partnership will work. It won’t.
The final point about whether you like the people you’re eyeing across the 
table is pretty important. If they show up as a bunch of arrogant jerks, they 
may not be a fit with your organization. Any common passions, interests, life-
styles or causes are a great foundation for a partnership. If you have nothing 
in common, leave the partnership paperwork in the drawer.
	
Mostly, partners simply want more business. Well, so do you, so that’s honest. 
The problem is that, in the heat of early discussions, you may fail to dig 
deep enough to find out whether the partner knows what getting that result 
requires. What it often really wants is for you to introduce it to your customers 
or to provide leads. In other words the partner is going after the low-hanging 
fruit. Don’t buy it, or at least, don’t commit yet. It’s too early.

Part VI: Making Influential Friends: Partnerships 
Testing the cultural fit: What 
do you have in common?
When you know a bit about each other, you want to go through a few more 
steps before sealing the deal. To begin, involve a wider group from your com-
pany and from the potential partner. Even if just for educational purposes, 
you benefit when people from the partner understand your company and 
how you operate and vice versa.
You also want to look for the same degree of liking, commitment and align-
ment of goals that you felt in the early discussions, except that now you can 
get feedback from other team members.
	
If you didn’t initiate the discussion, here’s your chance to check out the 
potential partner and provide your own feedback. Be candid internally, and 
then, if a partnership gets created with which you’re not wholly on-board, 
set your reservations aside and act as if you’re committed.
Table 20-1 provides a few topics for the second discussion and things you 
need to watch for. You have to provide the same information about yourself 
too, so the table is also a good checklist for preparing for such a meeting.

The customers it wants to 
serve
What are the partner’s plans? Do both businesses 
want to get into new areas or work, new verticals 
(industries), geographies?
How it measures success
Are you both tracking the same things? Is 
reporting back to each other on progress going 
to be easy? Can you align case studies and 
testimonials?

 Chapter 20: Pursuing Your Plans for a Successful Partnership
Important Topics
Aspects to Find Out and Share
How the partnership will be 
set up
Who’ll be the primary points of contact? Where 
will the parties need to work together? What 
structures do both firms envision for managing 
the partnership?
How customers will be 
handled
Who’ll handle the customer management and 
customer communications? Will this situation 
vary, or is one partner likely to predominate? 
Who’ll handle issues and fixing things? Are the 
partner’s customers happy (like yours) and how 
does it achieve that?
What preparation the partner 
sees is needed to kick off the 
partnership
Are joint marketing materials needed? Do 
people need any training in each other’s capa-
bilities? Do the salespeople need to be aligned?
The likely biggest obstacles to 
success
What causes issues in the businesses today? 
What are the weaknesses? Will these things 
impede the partnership?
Whether the partnership 
looks balanced
Given all the above, is the partnership looking 
like a fair arrangement for both parties?
How both parties feel at the 
end of the discussion
Check your gut. How do you feel? Trust your 
instincts.
No doubt you can see from the table that you need to like each other, respect 
each other’s work and not be greedy but be willing to share costs, effort and 
the benefits.
	
You may feel as if opening your kimono in this way is risky. But don’t forget 
that people respond to authenticity and are more likely to trust you when you 
temper your strengths with an open admission of areas you’re working on. No 
one’s perfect, so be suspicious of any firm that tries to look faultless. It can’t 
possibly be, so to put it plainly, such a firm is obfuscating or downright lying – 
neither of which has any place in a partnership.
After this critical meeting, get your team together to discuss the partnership. 
If you’re feeling especially organized, prepare a checklist where team mem-
bers can rate the partner and write down feedback. I provide an example in 
Figure 20-1.
	
Take team feedback seriously. In the end, many of your people are going to 
interact with the partner on the ground, selling and delivering work for cus-
tomers, which is hard enough already without adding problems. On a positive 
note, the team may see huge advantages in working with a new partner – and 
that would be a real bonus.

Figure 20-1: 
Team 
checklist for 
partnership 
potential.
Internally, you’re probably at a go/no-go decision point. You have three 
options:
	
✓	Proceed: Your team is aligned and enthusiastic. They see the poten-
tial and they’re willing to commit to the work. Proceed to the next 
section.
	
✓	Decline: You don’t think a fit exists, or you have other objections or 
concerns. Give the potential partner your decision, and, without being 
offensive or deceptive, explain why. Unless you’re really convinced by 
what its representatives say in response, don’t be swayed by promises 
to do things differently or attempt to ‘fix’ things.
	
✓	Defer: Maybe the opportunity has potential but the timing isn’t right. 
This situation may be for all sorts of reasons, so share your thoughts 
and recommend revisiting the partnership in 3, 6 or 12 months. Put a 
note in your calendar to have a further conversation at a later date to 
see whether the time has come.

 Chapter 20: Pursuing Your Plans for a Successful Partnership
Setting boundaries to stay realistic
	
When you’ve decided to go ahead, what the partnership isn’t going to be about 
is almost as important as what it is about. A bit like when you’re working on 
your offer (see Chapter 5), this stage is all about maintaining focus, not run-
ning all over the place chasing rainbows.
Partnerships can be heady, so get real. If your new partner is excited about 
this relationship, it’s probably looking at you through rose-tinted spectacles 
(even if you did try to be honest about your shortcomings). Take a long, hard 
look at yourself. What benefit do you really think you can bring to the part-
ner, with everything that you have going on today? Maybe it really is a slam-
dunk, but I guess that nine out of ten partnerships underestimate the level of 
effort involved (pretty much in the same way that they underestimate effort 
in any area of business that they’re not yet expert in).
	
With a specific partner in mind, here are a few questions to ask yourself:
	
1.	Can you meet the partner’s goals that you know about (see the next 
section)?
	
2.	Is your existing team enough to take on this new effort and if necessary 
can you reduce its work in other areas?
	
3.	Are you willing to appoint or even hire a partner manager and invest 
in some other services, such as developing marketing materials 
­(collateral creation) or getting new leads?
	
4.	What else would you have to do to make this work and are you up 
for it?
If the answer to any of the above is ‘no’ or ‘I don’t know’, consider stepping 
back or, if you really want to proceed, starting small. What can you realisti-
cally suggest to your partner as your initial commitment? When will you 
evaluate how things are going? Can you enrol it in a more modest endeavor? 
Unless the opportunity is time-critical (jump on it now or it’s gone), you may 
be better setting clear limits on the expectations and efforts.
Now, consider what you’re expecting from your partner. Are you being realis-
tic, or are you wearing rose-tinted glasses? Based on your observations, from 
both sides, set boundaries for the partnership. Define realistic goals, deter-
mine a reasonable investment and maybe even consider doing a one-year 
pilot with limited expectations. In some cases, you can’t be half-married and 
a pilot is unfeasible, but at least consider this possibility.
	
By the way, larger companies are no better at partnerships than smaller 
ones. In fact the bigger they get, the more money they pour into partnership 
structures, tools and resources, so the harder they find spotting what’s not 
working.

Part VI: Making Influential Friends: Partnerships 
Agreeing shared goals
You have your own agenda in creating this partnership – things that you want 
to achieve for your business that are specific to your growth and your future. 
Those objectives are for your eyes only, and, believe me, your partner has 
some of its own.
	
Therefore, you also want to create some common goals with your partner – 
things that you can both commit to that will drive the partnership forward.
	
Create a two-by-two grid on a sheet of paper or your word-processing program 
and label the four boxes with the following headings. Then create bullet points 
that provide a framework for your partnership and why it matters to you:
	
✓	Strategic goals: These goals support your primary goals and provide a 
pathway to a bigger future – maybe even as a united company, or as a 
partnership that has its own wings (that is, a partnership that becomes 
a force in the marketplace). As an example, you may be creating a new, 
unified service offering.
	
✓	Tactical goals: These goals meet a need, such as keeping your revenue 
levels healthy or improving your profitability. An example would be 
increasing your pipeline and portfolio of customers.
	
✓	Long-term goals: A clear market need exists for what you can do 
together and it has longevity (probably for the next 3–5 years or more).
	
✓	Short-term goals: An immediate market opportunity exists that’s proba-
bly of short duration, one you can go after together or with each other’s 
help. Maybe you both want to be in the other’s geography. After a year 
or two of supporting each other’s effort to break in to a new geographic 
area, you may not need each other anymore.
Lofty or humble, get clear about the shared goals and don’t puff them up into 
something bigger than they are. Tell it how it is, at least for the near term. If 
things go well, you can go big later. Set some near-term objectives, get them 
achieved and then create some new ones.
As you finalize your ideas, make sure to build them into your revenue plan, 
figure out your costs and present them to your ‘friends and family’ before 
inking the deal. You’re about to make a commitment and you want objective 
feedback beforehand.
	
If you create an informal partnership, with no goals and no contractual basis, 
it withers within months, as the poet TS Eliot wrote in ‘The Hollow Men’, ‘Not 
with a bang but a whimper’. Mostly, after initial enthusiasm, activity declines, 
no results are produced and people stop communicating. The thing is left 
hanging out there like an empty promise.

 Chapter 20: Pursuing Your Plans for a Successful Partnership
You need to do two more things to bring the partnership to life:
	
✓	Sign that contractual document: Be clear about what the partners will 
and won’t do, what’s allowed from a marketing perspective, how you’ll 
operate together, especially around a customer, and who gets what piece 
of the financial pie (for example, if one partner brings a deal to the table, 
does it get a cut of the deal?). Find a decent partner contract online and 
run it by your lawyer. It needs to contain a lot of the terms and condi-
tions that you write into your master services agreement.
	
✓	Share the news: Let your whole staff know about the new partnership 
and get them excited about its real potential: such a partnership is going 
to impact them, for sure. Decide whether to issue a press release or tell 
your customers or business network. The more you commit publicly, the 
more likely you are to do what’s necessary to achieve the desired result. 
No one wants to make a noise about something and then fail.
Understanding why partnerships 
don’t work
If your partnership isn’t working out at any stage, the reason is probably 
down to one or more of the following:
	
✓	Its benefits aren’t worth the effort.
	
✓	It has an under-investment of time and money.
	
✓	It contains some cultural conflict.
	
✓	It features inadequate communication and collaboration.
From tiny seeds . . .
Some friends of mine wrote a great book on sell-
ing and they asked me to review it. I knew their 
plan was to create an online course from the 
material and I saw a lot of potential in that. So I 
read the work and made comments. They then 
asked me to find a partner to build the online ver-
sion, so I did. Then we signed a referral agree-
ment for me to get them some customers.
At that point, I planted the seed that, if we man-
aged to increase their customer base through 
my efforts, perhaps we should consider a 
deeper partnership. Can’t tell you more – you’d 
have to sign a non-disclosure agreement 
(NDA)! I’m sure you get it. Start small, build 
from there.

Part VI: Making Influential Friends: Partnerships 
	
To mitigate these issues, make sure that you establish the partnership prop-
erly and put the necessary work into execution (see the earlier section ‘Setting 
Up a Good Partnership’). It still may not work, but at least you gave it your 
best shot.
Going to Market Together
I assume that you’ve selected a partner who’s said ‘yes’, signed on the dotted 
line and watched the eager bridesmaids trample over each other in a vain 
attempt to grab the thrown bouquet. But as all newlyweds know, or discover 
quickly, the wedding is only the start of the work.
In this section you discover all about establishing a primary contact, decid-
ing how to work with your partner, settling responsibilities and considering 
customer ownership, as well as optionally proceeding with white labeling 
or co-branding. If the last two points don’t apply to your firm, I also discuss 
something of interest to everyone involved: dividing the spoils!
Appointing a partner manager
Make sure that your partnership has a defined primary contact on both sides 
to organize collaboration, handle communication and deal with the road-
blocks. If no one’s at the helm, misunderstandings and challenges arise, and 
things tend to fall through the cracks, with everyone thinking that ‘someone 
else was going to do that’.
Initially, that person can have many other responsibilities, but later you may 
need a dedicated partner manager, especially if you have more than one part-
nership to run. This person needs to be a great communicator, motivator and 
decision-maker and be able to deal with issues promptly and effectively.
	
Does that remind you of anyone? Take a look at your customer managers and 
see whether you can perhaps promote one. If your partner manager can also 
be the customer manager for the first project, so much the better, because the 
person gets to see the partnership at work first-hand.
Creating a unified go-to-market strategy
You need to define how you’re going to work together with your partner, both 
to get customers and to serve them. You can work on these things as you go 
along, but being clear about what will need attention is a good idea.

 Chapter 20: Pursuing Your Plans for a Successful Partnership
	
At the core of the relationship is your ability to deliver the services to the 
same level of quality and customer satisfaction with your partner as without 
it. Problem is, you’ve devised all sorts of ways of doing that, and so has your 
partner, and those ways aren’t going to be the same.
Chances are that, if you’re in the same broad area of services, you find more 
alignment than difference. But even what you call something, say the stages 
in your methodology, can cause extreme confusion if you don’t align the 
terms. In fact, getting a new customer is relatively easy compared to deliver-
ing for the first time with a new partner.
Use the checklist in Table 20-2 and see which items are relevant to your situ-
ation. Put those items on your to-do list of things to discuss and hammer out 
with your partner.

Part VI: Making Influential Friends: Partnerships 
You may take so much for granted in your own business that you forget that 
you’re going to have to go through a re-invention when you acquire a new 
partner. Luckily, you both have great experience and a great track record of 
success to draw on.
	
Truthfully, you can’t tackle everything up front. Just have your checklist com-
pleted and use it to allocate time, when the time is right, to have a working 
session to crash through the details. For example, when a customer gives you 
a verbal ‘yes’ (in others words, you have a win, but are still in contract nego-
tiation), bring the team together and work on the team composition for the 
project (who’s going to be on the team from which partner), the methodology 
(how you’ll organize the work) and deliverables (the actual, tangible things 
you have to deliver to the customer).
Defining roles and responsibilities
One of the biggest areas of confusion in partnerships is deciding who does 
what. The allocation of roles and responsibilities depends a great deal on 
each partner’s strengths and weaknesses and what’s obvious from the go-to-
market strategy. At the core of the issue is: who owns the customer (see the 
next section for more) and who owns the contract? In most cases, the cus-
tomer wants ‘one throat to choke’ – in other words, wants to be clear about 
the prime contractor and its primary point of contact for the work, which 
doesn’t have to be the same partner, by the way.
	
Partner A and Partner B joined together to deliver a highly complex inter-
national website. Partner A does the user experience and design, Partner B 
does the implementation (builds the content management and commerce 
solutions). Typically, Partner B holds the contract because it has to support 
the customer long after Partner A’s work is done. But in the early stages of 
the work, Partner A takes the lead, manages the project and acts as customer 
liaison.
As you get to know your partner, who does what becomes clearer. Figure 20-2 
shows three of the many potential models for how partners work together.
In Model 1, Partner A is involved throughout and Partner B comes in only for 
the delivery. In Model 2, Partners A and B co-sell and co-deliver, but Partner B 
takes over the completion and probably the long-term customer relationship. 
In Model 3, both partners are fully involved throughout.
	
Interestingly, partnerships with obvious divisions make for great eventual 
mergers. If you’re much better at marketing and selling than your partner, but 
your partner’s strong at developing long-lasting customer relationships, this 
situation can be an even better proposition than where both firms are equally 
good at everything.

 Chapter 20: Pursuing Your Plans for a Successful Partnership
	
Figure 20-2: 
Models for 
how part-
ners work 
together.
	
	
Here are a few more questions to ask yourself concerning roles:
	
✓	Will a prime/sub-contractor relationship exist that determines who’s 
accountable for status reports, invoicing and customer management?
	
✓	Who’ll be the project manager?
	
✓	Who’ll manage communications?
Share your thoughts with your partner early on and determine who’s on the 
hook for every aspect of the customer lifecycle.
Tackling the question of 
who owns the customer
The area of who owns the customer can be a bone of contention, because the 
people who communicate with the customer most frequently gain more influ-
ence. Naturally, the choice has to make sense to the customer.
Take a look at Chapter 16 on customer management to review the pivotal role 
of a customer manager (often also called an account or project manager). 
What applies in your company also applies to a partnership. You need a 
customer manager who’s willing to be a great liaison between the two orga-
nizations and the customer; but both parties must also be willing to keep the 
customer manager informed about day-to-day progress.
	
Trust is imperative in this relationship. Monitor your initial project with your 
partner carefully to make sure that the customer manager, whether yours or 
the partner’s, is working out. Challenging people’s performance when they 
work in another organization can be a touchy subject. Get it wrong and it can 
be the death knell of your partnership. That’s why forming strong relation-
ships across the partnership at every level is so important – so that you can 
tackle issues as they arise.

Part VI: Making Influential Friends: Partnerships 
Wondering whether to white label or not
Some firms base their whole business on acting as a sub-contractor for other 
companies. Often, such firms don’t have a strong brand or a marketing/sales 
organization, but they do have a minimal website more directed at potential 
partners. When they work with partners, they take on the identity of the prime 
contractor (getting business cards and email addresses and acting as part of 
the prime’s organization). They sometimes get involved in the sales process 
to help scope and price the project, but the owner or one of the delivery team 
often supports the partner in the sale.
This approach is a form of white labeling: wrapping someone else’s product 
or service in your ‘branding’ and presenting it as your own. Originally from 
the music record industry, this term is now used in product manufacture and 
even in services.
The question is, however, will customers know that they’re working with 
partners? Some firms hide the fact (whatever the contract requires). In 
truth, most savvy customers become aware during the project that some of 
‘your’ people are sub-contractors. They may not care, because the work is 
getting done, they’re happy and that’s all they care about, or they may take 
exception.
The choice is yours, but I prefer to be open from day one. If you think doing 
so is a competitive disadvantage, you can hold off telling customers that 
you’re using sub-contractors, but I suggest mentioning it while contracts 
are in process at the latest. The customer usually approves it with little 
resistance.
Your competitors are probably doing the same anyway, so it may not be the 
disadvantage you think it is. Indeed, white labeling is becoming the norm 
in so many services industries that it’s probably much more common than 
anyone can detect on the surface.
Coping with co-branding
Whether you’re going public with a big story about your partnership, or just 
trying to get some deals together, consider whether and how to co-brand. 
You have your story and the partner has its story – and you may want to 
bring those narratives together in a way that makes sense.
	
Co-branding is when two or more brands are associated with a single service 
(or product). As always, the customer is what matters.

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
375
 Chapter 20: Pursuing Your Plans for a Successful Partnership
When you think about co-branding, consider the following:
	
✓	Are you combining the strengths of your companies into a more valuable 
service?
	
✓	Are you going to go to market together (market and sell in 
collaboration)?
	
✓	Is the customer going to work with a joint team, each party performing 
part of the service?
If the answer to all these questions is ‘yes’, you need to co-brand. In most 
contractual situations, you have to declare whether you’re sub-contracting, 
so being overt about the nature of the partnership is necessary.
Discuss jointly the mission and vision of the partnership: who you are 
together that you aren’t separately and what the brand guidelines should 
be. Mostly, partnerships choose to keep their brand ‘as is’ and create some 
modified marketing materials that tell the story. That’s the simplest and least 
expensive approach. While doing that, you also need to agree a positioning 
statement (what you do and who you do it for), align how you present, create 
proposals and construct case studies.
	
Although you probably need to be open about your partnership, you also 
don’t want customers to be confused. Ensure that you make understanding 
your partnership and who does what easy, and also create materials with a 
unified look and feel (for example, write your staff bios in the same style and 
ensure that your case studies are consistent in format).
Sharing the wealth
How the money gets divided up depends on what model of roles and responsi-
bilities you’re using (see earlier Figure 20-2). If you’re in Model 1, you’re carrying 
the cost of marketing, sales and customer management, so you expect your 
partner to give you preferential pricing on the work. In other models, the bal-
ance is different.
	
Above all, don’t avoid the conversation. Make sure that you:
	
✓	Have clear partnership terms in the partnership contract.
	
✓	Have agreed commission and pricing arrangements in advance for every 
type of case.
	
✓	Are clear about who’s doing the invoicing and when the other partner 
will get paid.
	
✓	Have a solid sub-contractor contract in hand to use when your first proj-
ect shows up. You can find plenty online, but make sure that you cover 
matters of insurance, pricing, invoicing and payment and what happens 
if a customer terminates the contract with the prime contractor.

Ten Regular Actions that Benefit 
Your Business
In This Chapter
▶	Identifying regular tasks that make a real difference
▶	Taking small actions each and every day
I
 
n your day-to-day life, you know that you gain beneficial results by repeat-
ing small actions every day: for example, walking a short distance to help 
get fit or memorizing a few additional words of a new language (bien sûr!). 
Well, business development is no different.
Schedule some time today for this chapter’s ten actions and keep a log. You 
never know – the wonderfully unexpected may well show up.
Making Five Business Phone Calls
Tackle the calls you don’t want to (yes, those darned cold calls). Doing so 
brings your firm four benefits:
	
✓	You conquer your dislike.
	
✓	You maintain your company’s presence in the market.
	
✓	You come to appreciate people who do this task all day.
	
✓	You’re sure to uncover a lead at some point (on average, after about 100 
calls – around four weeks from today).

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Calling Customers and Partners
Call every customer and every partner each month. Find out how things are 
going, what’s on these people’s minds and whether you can discover any-
thing to which your team needs to pay attention.
Every three months, take these people out to lunch, or at least drop by. You 
get feedback, more work and referrals. Feed any actions to the marketing, 
sales or customer-management folks.
Talking to Employees
Talk one-on-one with employees for 15 minutes every month. Find out what 
they’re working on, what they enjoy and what’s causing them grief.
You need to keep employee turnover down, so look for opportunities to 
motivate people to stay: provide new challenges and opportunities for career 
development.
Reading Some Blogs
From all the noise on the Internet, select three or four bloggers who provide 
value to your firm or to your customers and read their posts fully every day. 
They make good fodder for your own tweets or newsletter (see the next section).
Sending Out Three Value-Added Emails
You need to work hard at keeping relationships alive. Store interesting arti-
cles, blogs, events, white papers and the like, and send an item each to one 
new prospect, one new customer and one historical customer.
Updating Your CRM/SFA
Salespeople and customer managers need to keep daily notes in your customer 
relationship management (CRM) and sales force automation (SFA) systems 
and share them with the team (flip to Chapter 11 for details). Make sure that 
you capture emails you send, too. Keeping the history saves time searching 
through emails and trying to figure out where your time is vanishing.

Making Five New Connections 
on LinkedIn
LinkedIn is great for establishing new business connections: 80 per cent 
accept your invitation and 50 per cent respond to a message you send them, 
as long as this message is well crafted (check out Chapters 8 and 11 for 
more). Plus, you get access to their networks.
Tweeting Something
Leave tweets from the company account to marketing, but you can certainly 
tweet or retweet something on your own account – and it doesn’t all have to be 
business. Show your human side by tweeting about baseball, opera, mountain-
climbing or mending old clocks. After all, people do business with people they 
like. Check out Chapter 8 for more on Twitter – and get comfy with it.
Reviewing How Your Day Went
Ask yourself how each day has gone. Did you feel a sense of accomplish-
ment? Could you have delegated any busy work? Did something not get done 
(in which case, reschedule it)?
Also, clean up your email inbox and your desk at the end of the day – doing 
so is a huge timesaver for tomorrow.
Planning Tomorrow
Schedule everything you need to get done tomorrow (including working by 
yourself): for example, those five calls, the whitepaper you’re writing, that 
customer you’re calling. Don’t let people sabotage what you think is impor-
tant by interrupting what you’re doing. Give them an open time to come back.

Ten Key Metrics to Watch
In This Chapter
▶	Using metrics for revenue growth
▶	Putting metrics to work for business efficiency
I
 
f someone asks ‘How’s business going?’, can you answer accurately and 
with certainty? Part of business development is making sure that you can. 
Use the metrics (measurements) that I provide in this chapter to monitor the 
health of your firm. Doing so takes only a few minutes each week.
I discuss metrics of all sorts in much more detail in Chapters 6 and 7.
Knowing How Big Your Sales 
Pipeline Needs to Be
Is your sales pipeline the right size? When you know the typical sales cycle 
and closure rate, you can set a target number for the value of your pipeline 
and increase it as your company grows. If it dips, you know you have to act. 
For more on pipelines, pop to Chapters 6 and 7.
Maintaining the Right Number 
of Opportunities
You need to know how many opportunities you have at each stage in the sales 
cycle. You want a few in negotiation, a few more at proposal stage and more 
still at earlier stages. If the pipeline doesn’t have that shape, carry out some 
rebalancing by focusing effort on specific stages (see Chapters 6 and 13).

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Shortening Your Sales Cycle
Here are two crucial questions that you need to be able to answer: how long 
is it from a new lead to a closed deal on average; how long until you see 
revenue?
Work on shortening the sales cycle. Use what you find out to be ever more 
accurate with forecasting your revenue (see the next section).
Planning Projected Revenue
Get your backlog/projected revenue report going (see Chapters 6 and 7) so 
that you can plan for the customers that may be coming. If your sales cycle is 
long and projects are extended, creating that backlog is easy. But if both are 
short, use historical data and growth rates to take a stab at it. Use your back-
log to plan staff numbers, new equipment and training.
Producing the Right Number  
of New Leads
How many new leads do you see each week? Where are they coming from – 
the phone ringing, your website, replying to emails or adverts? Consult with 
marketing and sales and figure out whether the throughput is adequate, and 
whether the leads are the right leads: in other words, ensure that time spent 
on them is worthwhile. Check out Chapter 8 for more info on leads.
Assessing Planned versus  
Actual Revenue
Check the actual revenue numbers for the month that are just in and how 
they match up to your forecast. Are you ahead of the game or behind? What 
actions do you need to take if you’re behind? Make sure that you know how 
your company is really doing. Check out Chapters 7 and 13 for loads more 
revenue-based discussion.

 Chapter 22: Ten Key Metrics to Watch
Checking Profitability by Customer
You need to know which of your customers are making money for you and 
whether some are much more valuable than others. Gathering together all 
the costs and calculating profitability can take a good deal of work, but if you 
can do it you have more evidence of the sort of customers you really want.
Monitoring Cash Flow: Days  
Sales Outstanding
Cash flow is vital to every company ‒ many an otherwise efficient firm has 
bitten the dust due to short-term cash flow problems. Look into: how fast 
your customers pay; whether they’re on time or late; and what proportion of 
your revenue gets held up.
Watch this metric like a hawk and act promptly to collect.
Keeping the Customer Happy 
with Satisfaction Scores
Happy customers make a happy you! Are your customers happy? Use a mix 
of satisfaction scores and qualitative comments to help find any weaknesses 
and fix them. Do so formally at specific points in the customer lifecycle – it 
does wonders for the customer relationship (see Chapters 4 and 16 for the 
lowdown).
Minimizing Staff Attrition
Good people leaving can kill your business: remember that the best can get 
another job easily. Keep an eye on your turnover in staff and try to hire well 
and keep attrition down. You don’t want a reputation as a revolving door.

About the Author
Anna Kennedy is Founder and CEO of 
RainMakers (US), Inc. The company 
offers business development consulting 
and professional services to small and 
medium-sized services companies who are 
ambitious for growth, but somehow stuck 
in the journey towards higher results. She 
is the inventor of a proprietary methodol-
ogy, the ‘RainMakers’ Cookbook’ for busi-
ness development assessment and strategy 
development that helps clients examine 
their current state and plan for the achievement of their ultimate busi-
ness goals.
As a student and practitioner of business development for twenty years, 
Anna understands the challenges of business development for business 
owners, executives and senior managers who were not ‘born into’ the disci-
plines that constitute business development.
After a distinguished thirteen-year career in the UK as a mathematics, com-
puter science and business educator and author, Anna relocated to the US 
to take up an opportunity in professional services leadership. As Managing 
Partner at US Web and later at MarchFirst, Anna was involved in taking some 
leading US brands online in the early and heady days of the .com boom and 
ran the most profitable operation in the MarchFirst family. Those experiences 
provided direction for her thinking on how to create, operationalize, survive 
and successfully grow a services business. In 2003, she developed a model 
for customer lifecycle management that is an inspiration for many services 
firms today.
Today, Anna is a consultant, trainer and advisor to small and medium-sized 
services and product firms. She especially enjoys leading dynamic speaking 
engagements for small business owners and other with ambitions to be the 
best at business development.
Anna is married with four children and five grandchildren. Living in 
Pasadena, CA, she loves theatre, music and raising money for the Leukaemia 
and Lymphoma Society. You’ll find her any weekday between 5pm and 6pm, 
walking round the Rose Bowl.

Dedication
This book is dedicated to my husband, Liam Kennedy, who has given me 
unstinting support in anything I ever wanted to do throughout thirty five 
years of our relationship and marriage. His encouragement as I wrote 
Business Development For Dummies has been the rock I leant on when things 
got tough.
I also want to thank all the inspiring bosses I had before I founded my own 
business: Roger Howe (now Executive Chairman of Stemedica) for his guid-
ance and development of me as a US business leader, through Jim Howard 
(now CEO of CrownPeak Technology), Andrew (Flip) Filipowski (the greatest 
entrepreneur I have ever known), Brian Diver (now President and COO at 
SD.I), to Jason Meugniot and Jon Provisor (owners of Guidance, Inc.). Thank 
you, all. Finally, a special thanks to Kirkland Tibbels and John Patterson, 
founders of Influence Ecology, who grounded my ambitions and helped them 
become a reality.
