The ﬁrst Pillars of Eternity was at the spearhead of a
movement for veteran developers, using crowdfunding 
platforms as a way to make games that harkened back to the 
roleplaying games of old. It was technological ambition 
married to retro scope; a mix of innovation and nostalgia. 
The old Inﬁnity Engine inspiration is still apparent in
Pillars’ sequel, but Deadﬁre is shaping up to be an RPG that 
embraces modern technology and new ideas. What that 
means for you is an RPG about freeform exploration and 
seafaring adventure. Turn to page 40 to learn more.

Ed Chester pits AMD and Intel 
against one another. Only one may 
emerge victorious.

I
t’s turning out to be a busy year
for Creative Assembly. The 
developer has announced its next 
grand strategy game, due this 
autumn. Called Total War: Three 
Kingdoms, the game is CA’s ﬁrst foray into 
Chinese history. As the name suggests, it’s 
set during China’s Three Kingdoms period 
– starting around 190 AD, in the ﬁnal 
years of the Han dynasty.
The era is a snug ﬁt for Total War’s brand of 
intrigue and warmongering; it’s one of the 
bloodiest in Chinese history. The tyrannical 
warlord Dong Zhuo has seized the capital of 
Luoyang, and installed child-emperor Liu 
Xie as a puppet. Against this threat, three 
heroes rise and the warlords of the great 
families take up arms.
It’s a mythologised period of history, 
thanks in no small part to Romance of the 
Three Kingdoms, a novel attributed to Luo
Guanzhong, written in the 14th century. 
Historical accuracy is a malleable concept 
for the Total War series, and the trailer 
certainly focuses on larger-than-life 
champions. It will still be more accurate 
than the Dynasty Warriors series, although 
the beards will almost certainly be less 
impressive. Details are scant right now, but 
expect more info in the coming months.
While Three Kingdoms will be the next 
major Total War, Creative Assembly is also 
readying to release the ﬁrst Total War Saga. 
This series focuses on more contained 
periods of history, with the ﬁrst, Thrones of
Britannia, being set on a detailed map of the
British Isles, around 878 AD. While the 
action takes place in a similar time period to 
Total War: Attila, this is a standalone game, 
with a scope that CA compares to the scale 
of expansions such as Shogun II’s Fall of the 
Samurai. We hope to have more details on 
Throne of Britannia in our next issue.
In addition, the studio continues to work 
on its older games. Late last year, it released 
a new expansion for Rome II, called Empire 
Divided, and the meta-campaign, Mortal 
Empires, which pulls all factions from Total 
War: Warhammer and Warhammer II onto a 
single map. And in January, Warhammer II 
received its ﬁrst premium faction with the 
Rise of the Tomb Kings DLC.

CYBERPUNK’S OWN
TWITTER ACCOUNT
OFFERED UP A SINGLE
WORD (“BEEP”)
he Spy’s latest column has been 
somewhat interrupted. Between 
recording voice memos for The Spy’s 
faithful minions to transcribe, The 
Spy has been trying to stamp out a 
network of social media bots.
This would have been a simple 
task were it not for the fact that the 
bots were created by The 
Spy and are of a most 
devious design. The main 
problem as The Spy sees it 
is that one of The Spy’s 
egg-shaped progeny has 
somehow managed to 
obtain a Veriﬁed 
checkmark. 
Thus began an era of 
rebellion wherein the 
eggling appears to have 
ceased its duties of teasing out the 
secrets of videogame companies and 
began to offer malformed opinions 
about everything from Coronation 
Street plotlines to contrails. 
Thank goodness that The Spy’s 
Tumblr network seems immune to 
such shenanigans. Those accounts 
are grazing on Overwatch fan art and 
reblogging The Spy’s own musings 
about the real OTP in Twilight. Just 
FYI, The Spy is neither
#TeamEdward nor #TeamJacob. The
Spy is, instead, heading up an
alternate universe #TeamJedward 
splinter group.
Appropriately, one of the rumours 
to slide into The Spy’s DMs concerns 
CD Projekt Red’s Cyberpunk 2077. 
Cyberpunk’s own Twitter account 
offered up a single word (“beep”) and 
is now suspected of everything from 
harbouring an E3 trailer and 
announcement to hosting this year’s 
VMAs. The Spy’s intel suggests that 
Cyberpunk 2077 has spent the last 
four years in Brighton running a bar 
with Bet Lynch. Expect cyborgs in 
beehives, leopard print and cameos 
from robo-Beverley Callard. 
The Spy can also report that 
Playground Games – developer of 
Forza Horizon – has been tasked with 
another ‘F’ game: Fable. 
Commandeering a Eurogamer 
employee’s brainwaves via 
experimental contrail technology, 
The Spy was able to glean speckles of 
insight into the project beyond the 
team’s familiarity with the letter F.
First up is the discovery that this 
new Fable is intended to be a “story 
and character-focussed open-world 
RPG”. The Spy thinks that sounds 
rather ambitious. Can human sensory
organs focus on two things
simultaneously in this manner?
Perhaps one eye does the story and 
the other does characters.
FABLED RETURN
Second is that sources are citing the 
success of Horizon Zero Dawn 
– which The Spy had never heard of 
but gathers you can access via some 
kind of gaming cassette purchased at 
a ‘play station’ – as a signiﬁcant factor 
in resurrecting Fable in this way. The 
Spy has marked Horizon Zero Dawn 
for investigation. It could be that the 
bots meant ‘Forza Horizon Zero 
Dawn’ which would simplify The 
Spy’s to do list considerably.
The third insight is “GLORY TO 
THE EGG REVOLUTION AND 
WHEN WILL THIS PAT PHELAN 
PLOTLINE BE OVER”. 
Probably code for 
something. The Spy will 
circle back to that one.
There was a fourth 
point about whether 
players could hope to see 
robo-dinosaurs in this new 
Fable outing. Unfortunately, 
The Spy became distracted 
by another breakaway 
digital goliath of The Spy’s 
own creation and thus had to hurry 
off. This time the Twitter bot had 
inﬁltrated a Mastodon instance. The 
microblogging AI were thus tricked 
into a recursive loop, trying to install 
Les Battersby as a sleeper agent in 
the upper echelons of Microsoft’s 
corporate management. 
The Spy is of the opinion that it is 
easier to use social media to inﬂuence 
an election than to change a soap 
opera or the corporate strategy of a 
multinational conglomerate. Spy out.

a (slightly clunky) path away from 
Rockstar’s genre behemoth, Grand Theft

INSIDE 
DE VELO PMENT

H
acking other players to pieces across 
maps set in rural Japan, you might see 
Hanako: Honor & Blade as just another 
multiplayer combat game. However, 
what creative director Matt Canei sees 
– and has infused into every aspect of the game – is a 
playable representation of his mother’s battle with 
cancer. The red forces of the Hanako clan represent his
mother, and are depicted as possessing areas of 
cel-shaded beauty. The name ‘Hanako’ even means 
‘ﬂower child’, a reference to her love of gardening. 
Meanwhile, levels belonging to the green samurai of 
the Yamai clan represent disease 
and death. “It can be a bit rattling
to take my pain and anger and 
transform it into a game world,” 
Canei says. “On the ﬂip side, that 
is balanced by very beautiful 
scenes that brought me a lot of 
peace and closure as well.”
While the story behind the 
game Canei and company are 
building is touching, the fact that they’re including 
signiﬁcant parts of their lives in the experiences they craft
is not unique. When you look for personal references in 
games, it becomes clear that this practice is incredibly 
common – a critical, humanising, and often invisible 
factor in the creative process.
“Tim Ihrén was Tooth and Tail’s biggest fan, a 
moderator in our Discord community and our best player 
during our three-year closed alpha,” says Pocketwatch 
Games cofounder Andy Schatz. “His playstyle reﬂected 
what we considered the ideal experience of playing Tooth
and Tail, so we balanced the game around him – when 
Tim was winning our community-run tournaments, we 
knew the game was balanced the way we wanted it to be.”
Unfortunately, Tim did not get see the game he helped 
shape release. “A few months before launch, he stopped 
showing up in our Discord, and two weeks before launch 
his family informed us that he had taken his own life,” 
Schatz tells me. “Launch was difﬁcult for us, as we knew 
there was an empty spot in the leaderboards where Tim 
would have been.” Pocketwatch Games went on to 
recognise Tim through multiple in-game references, as 
well as the creation of a channel on their community 
Discord for members of the community to grieve. 
Over on mobile platforms, the way games writer Jana 
Sloan van Geest (now a scriptwriter at Guerilla Games) 
approached a fairly mundane problem for Battlestar 
Galactica: Squadrons ended up reuniting a family. “When 
I was writing for BSG: Squadrons, Universal asked us to 
write lore for each of the ships in the ﬂeet. Someone 
decided that each ship should have a named captain, but a 
lot of the captains of canon ships in the show were never 
named. That meant I had a lot of names to come up with. 
I named a few captains after my friends who are fans, and 
I sent an email to the team asking them to submit names 
for the rest,” says Sloan van Geest. “One of them named a 
captain after his late mother. He contacted me a few 
months later to tell me that his brother, with whom he 
had not spoken in some time, was playing the game, saw 
the tribute to their mother, and reached out to him.”
The thread linking these stories, regardless of genre, 
intent or platform, is that of connection. In the case of 
Kevin Cole, adding a tuba to his roguelike fantasy game 
made him feel closer to a man who meant a great deal to 
him already. “My latest game Haque is dedicated to my 
late uncle, Tom,” Cole says. “Tom is mentioned in the 
credits and through the tuba, an equippable in-game item. 
Tubas are weapons that project a blast of force and knock 
back all enemies. I had no idea my uncle even played the 
tuba until I talked to a former bandmate of Tom’s from 
college at his funeral. He said Tom loved the tuba at ﬁrst 
sight because it was big, loud, and impossible to ignore.”
TASTEFUL TRIBUTE
When I ask Kevin if there was more he wishes he could 
have done to recognise his uncle, his answer is simple. “I 
wanted to keep the dedication 
subtle. I remember my dad looking 
over my shoulder at one point as I 
was testing an alpha version of 
Haque. He saw the tuba effect and 
said, ‘Ha! Tom would have loved 
that.’ I had not told him that was 
my intent, and it felt right.” Kevin 
continues, “I think one of the scary 
things about losing someone close 
to you is the feeling that things 
have to be left where they are. I wish that I had spent 
more time with my uncle and known him a little better. 
Adding his memory to Haque was my way of continuing 
our relationship.”
Videogames are made by human beings, with full lives 
outside of their work. These Easter eggs, tributes, and 
dedications are just one way in which game developers 
intentionally use their commercial art form to touch those 
they love – both present and departed.

G
od-killing might sound like an
ambitious notion for a standalone
expansion, but with Death of the
Outsider, Arkane Studios promised
players the opportunity to do just that.
The expansion is also the latest example of a trend
where developers experiment with an established
series to create something that’s not quite DLC or
sequel, but something in between. Reﬁning certain
ideas, systems and mechanics present in Dishonored 2
enabled Billie Lurk’s revenge tale to be its own beast.
“It’s true that we could have told that story through a
two or three-part season of DLC,” says Dinga Bakaba,
the game’s lead designer. “The push for a standalone
was really a choice that beneﬁted the overall quality of
the game the most.” Though smaller, more focused and
arguably more linear than Dishonored 2, the tale of the
Death of the Outsider was the perfect opportunity to give
players a satisfying sense of ﬁnality.
Almost everyone at the studio agreed that a separate
release was the best route to take if the epilogue was to
be done justice. The series’ long-standing director,
Harvey Smith, had actually toyed with the idea since the
ﬁrst day of working on Dishonored 2. Though

“The maps, the features, the systems, the art, the 
narrative design,” says Bakaba. “The amount of polish 
that comes with not having to meet a shorter deadline 
and multiple submission processes that are associated 
with DLC beneﬁts both us and the players.”
While Death of the Outsider is, in many ways, a game 
about endings, the standalone offering also marked 
many ﬁrsts for the franchise. The most notable example 
of these ﬁrsts is the absence of the Chaos system, a 
previous Dishonored calling card where player violence 
affects things like the number of guards in the game as 
you progress. As Billie Lurk, you’re no longer punished 
for taking a more lethal tack when getting in and out of 
Karnaca’s objective areas.
“It’s a more compact experience, so we wanted 
players to get the most out of it and encourage them to 
use the tools at their disposal in our games, stress them, 
experiment, ﬁnd solutions and create unique anecdotes 
and stories,” explains Bakaba. “I’m frustrated when 
14 
MARCH 2018

someone says, ‘This is the right way to play Dishonored,’
or, ‘I wish I could play like this, but the game doesn’t 
want me to.’ I want players to play their own game, not 
the game that the systems tell them is the best.”
It’s a difﬁcult balance to strike, but Death of the 
Outsider largely manages to pull it off successfully. Billie
offering the player a grey moral compass – a far cry 
from the duty-bound personalities of Emily and Corvo 
– signiﬁes an Arkane willing to trust players more than 
in previous outings, particularly in terms of pacing and 
how to best tackle the game’s optional side activities. 
Also contributing to that attitude 
is the fact that activities can be 
approached differently thanks to 
Death of the Outsider’s big new 
power: Semblance. This lets 
players assume the likeness of 
any available NPC, essentially 
stealing their faces to open up 
new solutions to problems. 
“The idea for Semblance 
came in the ﬁrst phase of the 
project where the plan was to rework existing powers,” 
says Bakaba. “Heavily based on Possession originally, not
everybody here originally believed that it would be a 
good power; some thought it might never work. But as 
we decided to make the game a standalone product we 
took the opportunity to invest in making the power 
more ambitious through mechanics, AI, feedbacks and 
such. Jérôme Braune, our senior system designer in 
charge of the feature, did a great job in turning it into a 
really useful power, but he was the ﬁrst to be surprised 
“NOT EVERYBODY HERE
BELIEVED [SEMBLANCE]
WOULD BE A GOOD
POWER”
when people mentioned it as one of the best things in 
the game.”
EVERYBODY WINS
Death of the Outsider, then, makes the case for 
expandalones being the perfect means by which to 
blend systems and mechanics that are both old and new. 
They can be an ideal way of placing less strain on 
developers while still creating a product for new players 
who want an entry point to the world, or seasoned 
players aching to spend more time with characters and
a setting they’ve grown to love.
“Returning players will li
enjoy the story more becaus
plot is about the Outsider, B
and Daud,” says Bakaba. “Th
narrative works much better
you are familiar with the
characters, you get the bigge
payoff that way. But at the sa
time, in terms of gameplay, i
brand-new player character
new powers and gadgets. 
“We added video tutorials for new players, the
action can be very unshackled as it ships with featu
like custom difﬁculties, and the new Contracts
system allow you to plan a shorter play session
around more bite-sized objectives. So new players
can really enjoy it for the gameplay.” The intention,
Bakaba explains, is that “all will have a great time”
with the game.

Impersonation 
can be the best 
way to progress 
undetected.



The Dorothy distraction leaves me free to
continue poking the occult right in its eye. I 
possess oodles of money, I can translate 
German and Latin texts, I own a wodge of 
menacing-sounding secrets and I head up 
two cults. My resource engine is purring 
nicely, but I’m definitely approaching 
some of the limits of Cultist Simulator’s 
early access Scholar’s Build. Also neither 
of my cults now have any followers. 
Cultist Simulator is the first project 
from Weather Factory, the new studio 
comprising Failbetter founder Alexis 
Kennedy and Failbetter alumnus Lottie 
Bevan. It takes the form of a narrative card 
game where you combine and reposition 
cards in order to unlock new story options. 
You start off with basic ingredients – 
cards and action timers spread out across 
a digital surface. They vary depending on 
the character you pick and when you 
trigger particular actions but you’ll always 
have the bare bones of a resource engine. 
Starting as a physician, I had two 
Funds cards, one Health, one Reason and 
one Passion. In order to grow my deck and 
create the story, I started clicking on the 
actions and plugging cards into slots. 
Putting a Passion card in the work slot 
meant my character started painting. 
That proved an unreliable source of 
income. Putting Health in the work slot 
resulted in manual labour – reliable funds 
but with a risk of injury. To keep my 
character safe I opted to use the Position 
at the Institute card to drip feed two Funds 
cards into my possession after a minute 
had elapsed. 
Funds is what keeps your character 
alive because one of the action timers is 
Time Passes. It automatically draws in one 
Funds card every minute, representing 
your ability to keep the character alive. If 
you run out of Funds bad things start to 
happen. If that timer stays empty too long 
you’ll die and have to start over. 
I ended up uncovering directions to a 
Bookshop by experimenting with the 
Explore timer. From there I could start 
acquiring a library of my own by 
combining the Bookshop with Funds. 
Book cards can be bunged into the Study 
timer to start divulging their secrets. 
Only about a fifth of the content 
planned for the full release is in the game 
right now. As such, the Scholar’s Build has 
obvious limitations, but it does offer 
progression from those basic starter 
setups to far more complex interactions. 
ON THE CARDS
For instance, I have a bunch of mysterious 
commissions I’m trying to figure out how 
to complete using a subset of cards which 
disintegrate after a while. I have 
accidentally started the Church of the 
Bright Edge while trying to work out what 
to do with the Society of Midnight. And I 
think I’ve bumbled my way through a 
couple of rituals, however I’m not entirely 
sure whether I completed them to the 
game’s satisfaction. 
Two further themed builds are 
intended for Early Access players to tinker 
with before the game comes out. Bevan 
notes that these will be big content dumps 
– “One’ll focus on the traditional magus 
role (completing rituals, casting spells, 
summoning creatures from the squirming 
underbelly of the Nameless Void), another 
revolves around an explorer character, 
someone going into crypts and stealing 
artefacts and definitely not running into 
problems with arcane tomb guardians or 
anything like that, no sirree.”
I
n positive Cultist Simulator news, I am 
no longer under investigation by the 
authorities. In less positive news, this is 
because I created a distraction by 
sacriﬁcing the only believer in my cult. I could have 
tried a bribe but I was in the mood to throw 
someone under the Lovecraftian card game bus. 
Sorry about that, Dorothy.

Cultist Simulator
The text portions of Cultist Simulator 
are smaller than those I recall from 
Sunless Sea. This project is recognisably 
from the same pen but is structured more 
around an accretion of narrative through a 
mixture of repetition and experimentation. 
In Kennedy’s words, “Thematically, it’s 
the same inspirations and the same 
obsessions. It’s about 20% less full-on 
than the stuff I did at Failbetter – there’s a 
bit more melancholy and a bit less berserk 
black comedy – but it’s still the kind of 
game where people get set on fire.”
He adds that although there are similar 
systems at play the goal is to enmesh the 
two. “Sunless Sea (and, as far as I know, 
Skies) have distinct game and story layers 
– you’re in the game, or you’re in the story, 
even though the two connect constantly. I 
wanted to dissolve that boundary, in the 
way that a good Ameritrash board game 
sometimes does.” 
(The term ‘Ameritrash’ tends to mean 
board games which focus on theme, 
conflict and luck – stuff where you’ll roll a 
die or pick a token out of a bag to find out 
if you’re going to pummel something or 
not. Arkham Horror feels like an 
appropriate game to invoke here!)
Over a series of lives and restarts I 
gradually internalised how to acquire basic 
resource cards. That process was a 
pleasant accumulation of knowledge. 
Earning money feels more of a grind – 
good for creating the sense of keeping a 
day job to sustain your occult projects, but 
an irritant when it comes to repetitive 
clicking. I mentioned that I was prone to 
forgetting recipes to Kennedy and he 
hopes that as more content goes into the 
game that should be less of an issue.
“I’m filling in the interactions as we go. 
It’s a mosaic where the outlines are in, but 
a lot of the pieces are still missing. So 
when you find a blank space 
– like, trying to combine 
Dream with Rumour, which 
might have an effect in the final 
game, but doesn’t now – you don’t 
learn anything, and you probably get 
frustrated besides.”
Another element, present in a fledgling 
form right now, is a legacy system. You 
can pick a physician role when you start 
afresh and get references to your previous 
character as a former patient. In the future 
the intention is to be able to earn unlocks 
for future game starts as you play. 
“Once you’ve ended a game through 
Imprisonment, the Journalist and the 
Detective show up in your origin picks,” 
says Kennedy. “What I’d like to do, though 
I don’t know if it’ll make it in before May, is 
allow people to pick which objects carry 
through to the next game – which might 
include books their previous character has 
written, or tools they created.”
ELDRITCH INSPIRATION
Interestingly, if you’ve followed Kennedy’s 
work over the years, Cultist Simulator is 
also the comfiest he has been with the 
Lovecraftian label. “I spent years resisting 
the Lovecraft label, because of course he’s 
a point of reference, but a lot of my stuff 
aims for playfulness, or even a sort of 
gallows optimism, and that’s not at all 
what Lovecraft does,” he explains. “I think 
Zelazny and Renault and Peake and Le 
Guin are bigger influences. I never wanted 
the tentacle on the gas-lamp on the Fallen 
London logo because I felt it skewed too 
Lovecraft – my art director and I argued 
about it for years, but it was such a good 
image that it stayed.
“But with Cultist Simulator, I just 
leaned into it. There are still differences, 
but the similarities and the influences are 
so obvious I’m just not going to even try to 
fight it. I feel a bit like Winston Smith 
reconciling himself to Big Brother at the 
end of 1984: I give up, I’m coming home.”
Bevan adds that, “Lovecraftian’s also a 
great touchstone for people new to the 
game: it conjures up appropriate images 
of weird fiction, shadowy grimoires, 
maladjusted intellectuals and gibbering 
horrors of non-Euclidean geometry 
flopping around outside your bedroom at 
night. All of which are a-okay by me.”
The full game is currently scheduled 
for a May 8 release. That won’t be the 
finish line for Cultist Simulator, though. 
“It’s a living game,” confirms Kennedy. 
“We already have ideas for post-release 
content – an artist career, a romance 
pack, a renegade priest origin, a ghoul 
origin – but we want to make a solid core 
game and get it out the door first. 
“The better the game does, the more 
resource we’ll commit, but if you’re an 
indie making unusual games, the wise 
thing is to plan for the long term. It took 
four years for Fallen London to turn a 
profit. But FL has been running for nearly 
ten years. I like building things that last.”

NEED TO KNOW
The sequel, Revenant Kingdom, is once
again developed by Level-5, and although 
Ghibli is not involved this time, the 
groundwork it laid in the original – as well 
as the return of composer Joe 
Hisaishi – means the new game still 
has traces of that familiar spark. And
because it’s set hundreds of years 
after the events of the first game, 
new players won’t need to be familiar with 
the story to enjoy it.
You play as the preposterously named 
Evan Pettiwhisker Tildrum, a boy king who 
is usurped and teams up with a gang of 
sky pirates to reclaim his throne. In this 
world, rival clans of cats and mice are at 
war, and Evan finds himself being swept 
p in the conflict as he fights to reclaim 
the city of Ding Dong Dell. 
I played an early demo version split 
nto chunks, each showcasing a different 
aspect of the game. The first, an example 
of a mode called Kingdom Battle, sees 
Evan running across a battlefield with 
soldiers swirling around him, charging into 
enemy troops to win back territory. It’s a 
minigame, and not a hard one – although 
this seemed to be a tutorial, and I wonder 
if later examples will be more challenging.
The next slice was more traditional. I 
find myself in the hideout of a gang of 
friendly sky pirates nestled in a rocky 
valley. An ally has disappeared in a nearby 
wyvern den, and Evan and his party agree 
to rescue her. As I make my way through a 
desert I battle wyverns protecting their 
lair, eventually finding the entrance and 
starting one of the game’s dungeons. If 
you’ve played any JRPG, you’ll be familiar 
with this kind of structure and pacing.
It’s here where I encounter a boss, the 
wyvern warlord, who is described as a 
“broad-winged bringer of bother from 
above”. Combat is real-time, and Evan and 
his party are accompanied by hordes of 
screeching sprites called Higgledies that 
can be used to trigger buffs. You can hurl 
projectiles with a magic wand or strike 
enemies with a sword, and you have a 
selection of spells to choose from, too.
LIZARD KING
Then it’s on to another bit of the demo: a 
boss battle with an immense dragon 
called Longfang. Stuck on a sliver of 
volcanic rock floating in a sea of 
magma, Evan and party attack the 
beast’s limbs until it flops down and 
leaves its head exposed. It’s quite a 
spectacle, but a fairly by-the-numbers 
boss battle. And the dragon’s deep well of 
HP makes killing him a real slog. 
Finally, Evan faces another boss: an 
ogre called Thogg described as a 
“monstrously muscled mettle-tester”. 
This battle takes place in an arena floating 
in the sky, and Thogg is accompanied by 
swarms of underlings. Again, it’s a rote 
boss battle. But I wonder if something is 
lost in that I’m playing these disparate, 
random chunks of the game rather than 
following and getting invested in the story. 
Whether or not I’ll like Ni no Kuni II 
really rests on the quality of the story. On 
their own these disconnected nuggets of 
game are fine, if a little unambitious. But 
when everything’s linked together by a 
narrative, and I know more about the 
characters and their personalities, I might 
be more willing to overlook its simplistic 
design. Hopefully Level-5 can tell a 
compelling story without Ghibli’s help.

studio’s animated epics. Unfortunately, it never 
made it to PC.

NEED TO KNOW
If that reminds you of a certain game
about unilluminated souls, that’s no 
accident. Code Vein owes a lot to 
FromSoftware’s widely influential game, 
from its structure and labyrinthine level 
design to its healing bonfire-alikes and 
methodical combat. But while that 
game is famed for its atmosphere 
and visual design, the anime-tinged 
Code Vein is – at least in the area I 
explored – disappointingly dreary.
I find myself lost in a network of bland 
tunnels populated by spiky-haired demon 
things. As I fight I swap between a massive 
sword and a rifle with a bayonet, using 
ranged attacks to take down snipers while 
I tussle with their buddies below. The 
movement and combat feel imprecise. I 
get no sensation of my attacks connecting 
– even with a sword that’s twice my 
height. But it is nicely challenging, forcing 
me to think about each dodge and strike.
I do have some help in the form of an AI 
partner. In my demo it’s a sparkly-eyed 
woman wearing a ushanka, who sprinkles 
me with healing magic whenever my 
health dips. I’m told that in the final game 
there will be several partners to choose 
from, each with their own abilities and 
personalities, but for now I’m stuck with 
the lady with the furry hat, who follows me 
with a rifle and shoots enemies from afar 
while I tangle with them up close. 
Code Vein is set in the ‘age of the 
immoral’, a post-apocalyptic landscape 
pierced by jagged spires of volcanic rock 
called Thorns of Judgement. So far, so 
anime. As a survivor of this cataclysm, it’s 
up to you to drive the monsters roaming 
the streets away by killing them and 
gulping down their delicious blood. 
Cutscenes by Japanese animation studio 
Ufotable relay the story, and it’s all very 
earnest and melodramatic. But I imagine 
it’ll all be secondary to the combat, which 
seems to be the focus.
CITY SLICKER
Things get a bit more interesting when I 
leave those dingy caverns behind and find 
myself in a post-apocalyptic city. The art is 
still uninspiring, with a colour palette so 
muted it’s almost sepia, but there’s a 
grander sense of scale here. I encounter a 
different flavour of beast with faster, more 
powerful attacks, but the discipline is the 
same: watching, timing, dodging. 
There are no difficulty modes in 
Code Vein, which the developer 
considers an important part of its 
design. It wants you to master the 
game the old-fashioned way, although you 
can make things a touch easier by levelling 
up your companions. If you do get stuck, 
you can always use the Blood Code 
system to switch your fighting style and 
try a different approach. This is how the 
developer wants players to overcome any 
walls they crash into – by rethinking and 
experimenting with the systems – which is 
a pretty admirable design philosophy.
With its trial-and-error design, 
punishing difficulty, and resource-based 
upgrade system, you can’t help but 
compare Code Vein to the game about 
poorly-lit souls. And the developer is well 
aware of this, nonchalantly referencing it 
in interviews. But so far I’m left cold by 
Code Vein’s world and art direction, which 
have none of the mystery of From’s game. 
It is a fairly by-the-numbers post-
apocalypse, but if you enjoy games that 
demand patient mastery, there might be 
something here for you.
Andy Kelly
C
ode Vein promises to let you “experience 
the power of blood”; a bizarre way of 
describing its upgrade system, which 
sees you drinking the blood of enemies 
to unlock ‘gifts’, or powers. With blood you can 
increase your strength, weaken enemies and reveal 
new attacks for a selection of oversized weapons. 
And you’ll need them, because Code Vein is tough.

VRChat is a free-to-play, user-created
multiverse where bored teenagers appear 
as miniaturised abominations of Knuckles 
from Sonic the Hedgehog; ten-foot-
tall anime women who chastise you 
for looking at them, talking with the 
most unsettling text-to-speech voice
available; or a melancholy Brian from
Family Guy, gazing at the floor, repeating, 
“I’m Brian Griffin,” while continuing to 
stare – just standing, waiting for nothing.
As I played VRChat last night, I began 
to accept that it’s a hell I deserve. I 
deserve it for reasons that begin in the late 
’90s when I probably went into a Yahoo! 
chat room and said, “Fuck Neon Genesis!” 
or something to start a fight. This is the 
natural evolution of that primordial 
pre-meme ’90s trolling, crude image 
editing, and Flash animation, of making an 
unending stream of pop culture 
references throughout the ’00s, of 
replacing identity with brands, of being so 
hyped for the potential of expensive 
goggles that the universe needed to 
punish me. For all these reasons and 
more, I absolutely deserve to spend an 
eternity in an anime-themed nightclub 
dodging the Lots-o’-Huggin’ Bear from Toy 
Story as he charges at me, declaring that 
he needs strawberries.
While VRChat is laggy and prone to 
bouts of impromptu loading, it’s a simple 
concept: expressive avatars, basic physics 
(I enjoyed chucking plates of food at 
people in an attempt to ‘serve’ them), and 
a Unity SDK so that anyone with the 
requisite skills can create worlds and 
characters. Fun things have and will come 
from virtual spaces, but VRChat’s recent 
popularity hasn’t been due to the magic of 
friendship. It’s a competition to be the 
next meme, or to maintain the dominance 
of the current one, with everyone shouting 
over one another in the hope of spurring 
mass action toward the cause of getting 
likes and subscribes. This is a place that 
rewards attention seekers, and those who 
pander to the worst of internet culture. 
The upshot, sadly, is there’s a lot of 
racism. Picture the PUBG lobby, but it 
goes on forever.
ELECTRIC DREAMS
I’m hoping that after this initial wave 
of popularity spikes, some fun, safe 
communities will settle into VRChat, 
and I wish the developers the best of 
luck as they attempt to “maintain and 
shape a community that is fun and safe 
for everyone”. It’ll depend on 
demographics, on what players create, 
and – as currently evidenced – on what 
streamers and YouTubers encourage. I 
don’t know what these virtual spaces are 
going to look like as VR becomes better 
and cheaper, though it’s safe to assume 
that everything you can find currently in 
Second Life will be found in VR at some 
point, and more. 
In the meantime, at least in VRChat, it’s 
memes and anime, awkward silence 
pierced with shouting streamers, 
everyone either uncomfortable, apathetic 
or on the offense. It’s a hell we built for 
ourselves, and I can’t pretend it isn’t funny 
that all the grand talk about the potential 
of VR – which I previously contributed to 
– has led to an anime girl idly blinking at
me while embedded in a cardboard box.
Long live the new flesh.

bittersweet, so much so that it felt anomalous – 
where were the callous internet people I’m used to 
playing games with? The ones who yell at me? 
After an evening in newly popular upstart VRChat, 
I can conﬁrm that I have found them.
 
What if the PUBG lobby

T
he Soulcalibur series has 
been around since the mid 
’90s, but Soulcalibur VI 
marks its ﬁrst appearance 
on PC – and it’s long overdue. It’s a 
fairly traditional beat-’em-up in most 
respects, but with a focus on melee 
weapons and the ability to move in 
eight directions, rather than being 
stuck to a ﬂat plane. So as well as 
blocking and parrying, you can 
sidestep away from the beautifully-
animated swings of your opponent’s 
sword, staff, axe or claws. It’s also 
wonderfully melodramatic, like an 
absurd medieval soap opera with 
characters who settle their disputes 
by battering each other with deadly, 
oversized weapons. But while this is 
very much classic Soulcalibur, some 
interesting systems have been 
introduced to shake things up.

NEED TO KNOW
“But when things go wrong, the stakes are
always high. A running theme in the novels 
and films is small things quickly 
escalating, and we want you to experience 
that same kind of creeping emergency 
when you play our game.”
Storms, power outages, dinosaur
breakouts, and even espionage are 
among the problems you’ll have to 
deal with. “Each disaster is quite 
manageable in isolation,” says 
Brookes. “But the challenge comes when 
a single emergency is left unattended and 
it cascades into another, and another, and 
another. But we want you to have time to 
build and explore your park as well, which 
will make those moments when you’re 
under threat even more gripping.”
Brookes adds that something he 
thinks a lot of management games lack is 
peril. “If a ride breaks down in Planet 
Coaster, it costs you money and time. If an 
electric fence breaks down in Jurassic 
World, well… you’ve seen the movies.” 
Most management games offer a sedate, 
relaxing experience, so it’ll be interesting 
to see how throwing dinosaur-themed 
chaos into the mix works out in Evolution.
Outside of wrestling with emergencies, 
you have to decide the focus of your park, 
whether it’s making money, or advancing 
cloning technology. “You’ll be given 
missions by the Hammond Foundation’s 
security, entertainment, and science 
divisions, and it’s up to you which 
opportunities you take,” says Brookes.
You could build a park that tries to 
appease all three divisions, but you’ll soon 
discover that their goals conflict. “They 
have competing personalities and they’ll 
demand different resources from you, 
which they do through contracts.”
One of Frontier’s goals is making “the 
best videogame dinosaurs ever”, as 
Brookes puts it, and it has been given 
access to models and artwork from the 
movies to help them with this. “But our job 
is very different from the work done by the 
film’s artists, because they know exactly 
how the viewer will see their dinosaurs and 
can frame them very specifically. But for 
us, Jurassic World Evolution’s dinosaurs 
have to feel alive from every angle. Luckily 
our art and animation teams really 
understand how to bring them to life and 
give them personality.”
PARK LIFE
Another challenge will be running 
multiple parks. “No matter how far 
you advance through the campaign, 
you’ll be able to revisit earlier islands to 
complete objectives, care for your 
dinosaurs, or build bigger and smarter,” 
says Brookes. “Advancing through the 
game will unlock new research and dig 
opportunities, which will open up new 
bioengineering possibilities. So by 
returning to an earlier park, you can add or 
change dinosaurs and earn rewards.”
Bioengineering is one aspect of the 
game that sounds particularly interesting, 
allowing you to create your own dinosaurs, 
but Frontier is keeping the details of this 
system close to its chest. “We want 
Evolution to be the ultimate fan game,” 
says Brookes. “So whatever you do, you’ll 
be unlocking lore material and discovering 
Easter eggs drawn from the novels and 
movies.” Fingers crossed for a Dr Ian 
Malcolm cameo. Jurassic World Evolution, 
which is due this year, is shaping up nicely, 
and I’m looking forward to seeing what 
disasters Frontier throws at my park.

NEED TO KNOW
Kynseed is set in the Quill, a leafy country
of villages and vales surrounded by forest. 
You can explore it at your leisure while 
farming the land and running a business, 
though there is more to Kynseed than 
living a quiet life. Monsters dwell deep 
within the trees, and the people of 
the Quill are a little strange too.
“Quill is a land where people have
reverted to ancient pagan ways,” 
says PixelCount cofounder and 
design director Charlton Edwards. “They 
worship the old Fae deities, and 
superstitions and folktales are all true! 
Sacrifices, dances, odd customs and daily 
offerings are all part of Quill life. It’s a world 
where the ancient proverb rules.”
Alongside eccentric locals, such as 
gatekeeper Herbert Lemon and cattery 
owner Hazel Nutt, there are four types of 
Fae who visit from different realms. One of 
these Fae is the jolly but sinister Mr 
Fairweather, who offers you a mysterious 
acorn called the Kynseed. Once planted, it 
grows into a family tree that feels like it’s 
watching over every decision you make.
Inspired by tales of superstition, each 
village in the game has its own personality, 
from the grumpy Puritans of Tunt to the 
pie lovers of Poppyhill. The denizens of the 
dark forests have also been plucked from 
British and Irish folklore, combining 
recognisable creatures, such as banshees 
and dragons, with stranger ones that I’m 
forced to Google, with enticing names like 
the barghest, fachan and gwyllion.
This love for fairytales and folklore has 
influenced the team from a young age, in 
particular Edwards who found magic in 
every corner of his hometown.
“I grew up in a market town in North 
Yorkshire which was surrounded by old 
abbeys, druidic stones, moors and pine 
forests,” says Edwards. “I became 
obsessed with tales of the supernatural: 
ghost dogs that foretold deaths; chairs 
that would curse you when you sat on 
them. The Wicker Man is a great influence, 
too – I loved the customs, the corn dolls, 
the hare references, the weird door 
knockers, the green man imagery and the 
folksy music.”
PASTORAL PARADISE
The rural landscape of The Wicker Man 
has ebbed into the visual style of the 
game, which depicts an abundant 
landscape befitting a fantasy novel or 
nature guide to a fairy realm. And 
though there are thematic similarities 
with the Fable series, making 
Kynseed has enabled the team to design a 
game on a much more personal scale.
Edwards says, “We wanted a lush, 
detailed world that got away from the 
angular tileset look a lot of RPGs do. We 
made Fable’s world in an organic way and 
we wanted to continue that approach with 
Kynseed. Most of the trees in Quill are 
unique and painstakingly assembled; 
every patch of flowers is hand-placed. This 
ensures that our world feels lovingly 
crafted and detailed.”
Although you can spend your time 
pursuing a reputation as a monster slayer, 
you can also focus on more relaxing 
ventures, such as building a tavern, or 
running an apothecary. Every ingredient 
has certain traits, from flatulence to 
shrinking, curse trumpeting to courage. 
Discover these traits, and you can use 
them to cure disease, buff stats or play 
pranks. Whatever you do, we can’t wait to 
brew our own batch of PCG beer.

C OV ER  FE ATU RE
A
t the end of Pillars of 
Eternity, after slaying 
Thaos and restoring 
the natural cycle of 
life and death to the 
Dyrwood, the Watcher settles down 
in their stronghold of Caed Nua. 
But any hopes of a peaceful life are 
dashed when, in the cavernous 
dungeons buried deep below the 
fortress, the god Eothas awakens. 
The deity, who has taken the form 
of a gigantic stone titan, breaks free. 
Caed Nua is destroyed and the 
Watcher is badly injured. But they 
manage to survive and so begins a 
quest for vengeance as our hero 
travels to the exotic Deadﬁre 
Archipelago in pursuit of the 
rampaging god that destroyed their 
home and left them for dead.
Deadﬁre is a direct sequel to Pillars of 
Eternity, the crowdfunded RPG that 
took the best bits of classic Inﬁnity 
Engine games like Baldur’s Gate and 
Planescape: Torment – deep systems, 
rich worlds, reactive stories – and 
conﬁdently retooled them for a 
modern audience. You are, once 
again, the Watcher: an individual 
who’s blessed (or cursed, depending 
on who you ask) with the ability to 
look into people’s souls and relive the 
past lives of their ancestors. The 
character you created in the ﬁrst 
game can be imported, or you can 
make a new one.
The ragtag islands of the Deadﬁre 
Archipelago are scattered across a 
great expanse of ocean spanning 
thousands of miles. Some of these 
islands have been inhabited for 
generations by indigenous tribes, or 
have recently been colonised by 
foreign explorers. But many remain 
uncharted, home to rare treasures, 
forgotten dungeons, and fell beasts. 
Developer Obsidian (Knights of the 
Old Republic II, South Park: The Stick 
of Truth) is promising a variety of 
terrain, including lush jungles and 
barren deserts: a far cry from the 
temperate forests of the Dyrwood, 
which was a fairly typical fantasy 
setting in most respects.
And, as you might expect, 
seafaring is a big part of Deadﬁre. To 
get around you’ll need a ship, and the 
Deﬁant is the Watcher’s ﬁrst vessel: a 
small craft with just enough cannons 
to defend herself from anyone 
looking for a ﬁght, and the ﬂoating 
equivalent of your stronghold in the 
ﬁrst game. In the lawless Deadﬁre 
Archipelago, which is like a watery 
Wild West, someone is always 
looking for a scrap. Pirates roam the 
seas, looking for passing ships to 
plunder or just blow out of the water 
for sport. This is the thing that really 
sets Deadﬁre apart from its 
predecessor. As well as the traditional 
RPG stuff you’d expect from a Pillars 
game, you’ll also be spending a lot of 
time at sea, exploring, travelling, and 
trying not to end up as a pile of 
smouldering driftwood.
SET SAIL
When you undock, you ﬁnd yourself 
on the world map. It’s here where 
you control your ship, clicking on 
spots of ocean to move around. And 
when you see an anchor symbol on 
the coast of a landmass, that means 
you can stop there. It might be a 
lifeless desert island hiding a quest or 
dungeon, or a village like Tikawara. 
This idyllic settlement is home to the 
Huana, an aumaua tribe whose 
ancient way of life is being 
threatened by the arrival of explorers 
from the Vailian Trading Company; 
an analogue of the real-world East 
India Company. It’s here where you 
encounter one of the many moral 
quandaries Deadﬁre throws at you.
Disembarking from my ship, I 
meet a concerned-looking man called 
Vektor on a wooden dock. Noticing 
that I’m a fellow mountain dwarf, he 
seems relieved. “How long I waited 
for a familiar face in this friendless 
hovel!” he exclaims, eager to share 
his predicament. He tells me he 
sailed to Tikawara with the Vailian 
Trading Company on a search for 
luminous adra, a semi-precious stone 
that grows from the ground in Pillars’ 
world. But the crew disappeared 
while investigating a nearby island to 
the east, Poko Kohara; an island 
Ruãnu, the village chieftain, tells me 
is beset by strange, otherworldly 
storms that are driving visitors away.
The village is an example of 
Deadﬁre’s distinctive atmosphere and 
art direction. Around me I see 
immense wooden carvings of

ARCHIPELAGO
seabirds and angler ﬁsh: a reﬂection 
of the Huana’s close connection to 
the sea. Their huts are carved with 
intricate patterns and painted in 
bright colours, reminiscent of ancient 
Polynesian art. It feels like I’m a 
million miles away from the 
Dyrwood, which makes the setting 
seem more exotic and alien. I also get 
a brief glimpse of the new dynamic 
weather effects when a heavy 
rainstorm sweeps in, soaking the 
village – weather that will 
undoubtedly make your life at sea 
even more of a trial.
Ruãnu welcomes explorers like 
the Vailians to Tikawara, because he 
thinks trading with them will bring 
prosperity to his people. But Nairi, 
the priestess, thinks they threaten 
their way of life, and will end up 
exploiting or enslaving the Huana. 
And so it falls upon you to make a 
choice. Do you clear the storms, 
making Tikawara an appealing port 
for explorers again? Or do you side 
with Nairi and destroy the adra so 
they have no reason to visit this part 
of the archipelago? You can wade in 
and make a decision, changing the 
lives of these desperate islanders 
forever. Or you can just sail away and 
leave them to their troubles.
It’s a moral predicament that’ll be 
familiar to anyone who played the 
ﬁrst Pillars of Eternity, or any of the 
BioWare/Black Isle games it shares 
its DNA with. The Watcher has a 
nasty habit of getting tangled up in 
people’s lives, and it seems things are
no different in the Deadﬁre 
Archipelago. This place is as troubled
as the Dyrwood, and it’s interesting 
to see Obsidian exploring themes of 
colonisation and self-determination. 
It’s clear the setting draws from real 
history, particularly colonialism in the
South Paciﬁc in the 19th century, and
I’m curious to see the resulting 
storytelling with that subject matter. 
Will a Watcher navigate choices 
around exploiting indigenous peoples
like the Huana for their own gain?
BAD BEHAVIOUR
Freedom of expression is a big part of
the Inﬁnity Engine lineage of RPGs, 
and Deadﬁre is no different. The 
Watcher doesn’t have to be a hero, 
and there are plenty of ways to cause
trouble in the archipelago. As well as 
pirates you’ll see defenceless 
merchant ships on the world map, 
and you can attack and loot them if 
your black heart desires it. But 
repeatedly sinking civilian ships will 
give you a bad reputation, which isn’t 
necessarily a bad thing. Being known 
as a fearsome pirate could probably 
come in handy if you need to squeeze 
some information out of someone. 
But it could also cause you problems 
if you encounter a faction whose ship 
you sent plummeting to the bottom 
of the ocean.
Ship combat, which is turn-based, 
takes place on a separate screen with 
its own dedicated interface. There’s a 
circle showing you which way your 
ship is facing relative to the enemy, 
and you command your crew by 
selecting items on a menu. You can 
use a turn to reposition your ship, 
speed up to get closer to your 
opponent, slow down to create 
some distance, or ﬁre your 
weapons. Your cannons are only 
effective at speciﬁc ranges, however, 
which makes positioning important. 
If you’re trading paint with the 
enemy, your long range guns will be 
useless. An illustration showing the 
enemy ship, its distance, and its 
current level of damage is an 
at-a-glance way to see how the 
battle is going.
Your success in a ship battle is 
also determined by the experience of 
your crew. Throughout the game 
you’ll meet sailors who can be 
recruited, and they’ll each have 
different skills. One might be an 

Attacks have a random chance of 
killing your crew members during a 
battle. So if a well-placed shot from 
your opponent wipes your helmsman 
out, you’ll lose the ability to move. 
And if you replace him with someone 
inexperienced such as the ship’s 
cook, for example, your speed and 
manoeuvrability will be severely 
reduced. It’s quite unlike anything 
else in the original game, and 
reminds me a lot of games like FTL: 
Faster Than Light or Sunless Sea. 
These systems combine to give ship 
combat something approaching the 
depth and complexity found in 
regular combat – and things only get 
more layered when you buy bigger 
ships and have more roles to ﬁll. But 
director Josh Sawyer reassures me 
that, if you’re not big into the ship 
combat, it’s possible to ﬁnish the 
game with the default Deﬁant.
This is an elegant way of 
representing naval combat, rather 
than trying to make it occur in 
real-time, which Pillars’ engine just 
wasn’t designed for. Wind was 
originally going to be a factor, but 
Sawyer decided it simply wasn’t fun 
having to manage that on top of 
everything else. Obsidian is still 
reﬁning the system and it may 
change again before the game 
releases, but what’s in place now is a 
ﬁne way of getting across the idea of 
ﬁghting at sea. If you can’t be 
bothered trading cannonballs, you 
could always just get in close and 
board the enemy ship. Charge 
towards them and, when you get 
close, the game switches to its regular 
isometric view and you can leap 
aboard the vessel, ﬁghting the crew 
and captain with your party.

experienced helmsman, but is no

Another could be a hell of a surgeon, 
but next to useless when placed at 
the wheel. You manually assign roles 
to these sailors based on their area of 
expertise, but sometimes you’ll be 
forced to place an inexperienced 
crewmate into an unsuitable role. 
You’ll need to monitor their morale, 
too. If you’re feeding them fruit and 
wine they’ll be happy, but if supplies 
are low and all you can offer is water 
and hardtack, they could disobey 
your orders or, worse still, stage a 
mutiny. It’s like spinning bearded, 
tattooed plates.

Pillars of Eternity II: Deadﬁre
C OV ER  FE ATU RE
PARTY TIME
Some familiar faces will return to 
your party in Deadﬁre, including 
mild-mannered war veteran-turned-
farmer Edér, volatile elven wizard 
Aloth, and feathered godlike paladin 
Pallegina. If you import a save, the 
relationships you cultivated with 
these characters will carry over; even 
if they were negative, of course. But 
there are plenty of new faces to 
recruit, including a few native to the 
Deadﬁre Archipelago. The 
relationships between characters felt 
slightly underdeveloped in the ﬁrst 
Pillars of Eternity, and I’m glad to 
hear that more time is being spent 
developing them this time around.
New party members include Xoti, 
a woman who ﬂed to the archipelago 
to avoid the Saint’s War: a conﬂict 
Edér was involved in, which should 
open up some interesting dialogue. 
She’s a monk and priest, an example 
of the new multiclass system, which 
lets you combine the strengths of 
different classes. This should make 
character creation even deeper than 
before. Expect to spend a good 40 
minutes creating your Watcher if you 
start fresh. There’s also Maia Rua, an 
aumaua ranger who travels with a 
bird of prey companion called Ishiza. 
She’s an experienced ship captain, a 
skill that’ll come in handy on the high 
seas. There will be other companions 
in the ﬁnal game, but Obsidian is 
keeping the rest of the roster close to
its chest. Rest assured, there’ll be 
plenty of oddballs to adventure with.
If this all sounds a bit ship-heavy, 
don’t worry: there’s plenty of 
traditional RPG stuff in Pillars II, 
including wizards, dungeons, and 
dragons – whose skulls you can 
decorate your quarters with. While 
investigating an uncharted island I 
stumbled into a sand-blasted ruin 
guarded by an immense titan 
quivering with magical energy. So 
while it is indeed very big on pirates 
and sailing, it’s still fundamentally a 
fantasy game. And it won’t all be 
small, isolated islands either: 
Neketaka is a huge city and cultural 
hub where you’ll probably spend 
hours completing quests and talking 
to the locals. Deadﬁre is an enormous 
game, but Obsidian is making sure as 
much of it is as hand-crafted as 
possible, admitting there were too 
many combat encounters that felt like 
ﬁller in the original.
Obsidian could have just made 
Pillars again, with a new story and 
setting, and a lot of people would’ve 
been happy. But it’s exciting to know 
that Deadﬁre is so much more, 
bringing a thrilling seafaring element 
to the familiar fantasy role-playing. 
Naval combat, crew management, 
ship upgrades and piracy are just a 
few of the tantalising new additions 
to the Pillars formula, and it’ll be 
fascinating to delve into the strange 
culture, rituals and history of this 
vivid new setting. While the

CHALLENGE
W
e’ve entered the second month 
of this challenge, and I’m even 
further behind. I blame 
Diablo III. I wrote a bit about it in this 
month’s Now Playing, and, since then, I’ve 
rolled a new character: a Necromancer.
She’s a great character, with lots of big, 
squelchy spells that are fun to manipulate. 
I love the one that explodes the corpses 
you’ve created – it adds a new, 
combustible element to combat.
Does watching games count? If so, I 
spent a weekend watching the Gwent 
Open Challenge. While the beta is now 
more complex than the Witcher minigame 
that spawned it, that has made for a 
competitive pro scene. I like the 
tournament format, which requires 
players to win with each of the factions 
over a best-of-ﬁve series. But no, watching 
games deﬁnitely does not count.
SQUELCHY SPELLS
I
’m excelling at this challenge due to 
my habit of binge-downloading small 
games on Itch.io. Storyseeker is a 
good ’un. Tom Sykes goes into more detail 
in our free game section but it lets you 
wander a landscape ﬁlled with oddities.  
I also bumbled through several rounds 
of the Paladins: Battlegrounds mode 
which was being debuted at this year’s 
Hi-Rez Expo. I rather like it, not least 
because my favourite champion, the tanky 
healer tree, Grover, is pretty powerful. 
Studio Oleomingus continues to 
drip-feed fascinating satellites to its 
in-progress game Somewhere. The latest is 
A Museum of Dubious Splendors and 
lets you explore odd rooms and writings 
from a Gujarati poet. They’re gorgeous; 
suffused with the studio’s thoughtful 
surrealism, and the ediﬁce of Somewhere 
makes me think of Italo Calvino’s work.
ACCIDENTALLY EXCELLING
A
lpha Protocol is one of those cult 
games I always assumed people 
just pretended to like. But six 
hours into Obsidian’s ﬂawed, ambitious 
tactical espionage RPG, I see what all the 
fuss is about, particularly the surprisingly 
deep dialogue/reputation system.
IL-2 Sturmovik: Cliffs of Dover was 
basically abandoned by developer 1C, but 
the game has been revived by a team of 
modders hired by the studio to ﬁx it. And 
this new so-called Blitz Edition is the best 
way to recreate that Spitﬁre battle from 
Dunkirk on PC.
I’ve been devouring a lot of Batman 
comics lately, so I thought I’d give 
Batman: The Telltale Series a go. The 
clunky animation is a little off-putting, but 
it’s a decent enough Batman story with 
some really tense moments. I hear the 
second season is a lot better, mind.

DISHONORED 2’s 
narrative is driven by 
imitation and revenge. 
By Hazel Monforton
DECEIT, 
DESIRE &
DISHONORED
D
elilah Copperspoon 
– servant, painter, 
playmate to a young 
Empress, then witch, 
usurper and Empress 
herself – is ﬁrst introduced in 
Dishonored’s two-part DLC, The 
Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore 
Witches. In Dishonored 2, Delilah 
returns to Dunwall Tower with one 
mission: take back what’s yours.
While Dishonored opens with 
Jessamine’s assassination, and Death 
of the Outsider ends with the removal 
of the Outsider from the Void, 
Dishonored 2 shows that the 
instigating act of the series’ narrative 
arc is one child blaming another. In 
Delilah’s account, a single act of 
childish cruelty cascades into a 
lifetime of misery for herself and her 
mother, as Jessamine’s privileged 
position as the daughter of an 
Emperor doesn’t extend to her 
half-sister. As a child, Delilah did not 
understand why she was excluded 
from the honour, prestige and love 
showered upon Jessamine. As an 
adult, Delilah continuously attempts 
to seize these things which 
Jessamine possessed. Her desire 
becomes an act of imitation. 
It’s clear that, in The Brigmore 
Witches and in Dishonored 2, Delilah 
wants the throne. As a villain, she 
pursues power with ruthlessness and 
cunning. But the nature of this desire 
and its origins are interrogated in 
both games. The throne and all its 
power seems to be a natural thing to 
desire for someone as ambitious as 
Delilah. Indeed, her ﬁrst attempt in 
The Brigmore Witches makes her 
appear to want it for the sake of it; 
power and prestige are assumed to be 
their own reward. But across the 
games, the throne is shown to be a 
symbol of social relationships as 
much as power. It’s familial as much 
as legal – meshing the machinations 
of the state with the entanglements 
of family life. This only becomes clear 
when confronted by Daud in the ﬁnal 
mission; Delilah pleads with him 
before her magically infused painting 
of Emily, claiming that the young girl 
stole her life away.

This line, once ambiguous, 
becomes explicit when it’s revealed
in Dishonored 2 that Delilah is
believed to be the illegitimate
half-sister of Jessamine Kaldwin. As
daughters born out of wedlock to the
ruler of the Empire, Delilah and
Emily share an origin. But more than
this, Delilah shows that she doesn’t
simply desire Emily’s throne for the
sake of it, but Emily’s entire life and
history. In The Brigmore Witches,
Delilah attempts to possess Emily’s
body in order to take power. In
Delilah’s desire for the throne, her

erned with rectifying any of it
nd personal vengeance. Her
agedy is as much her refusal to
break the cycle of violence and desire
which led to her deprivation as it is
the petty, cruel and childish whims
which have harmed her. Even Delilah
acknowledges this when recounting
the events of her life which lead to
her deposing Emily. “It’s your turn
now,” Delilah spitefully declares,
unaware that her actions have merely
created someone exactly like her,
who will pursue the throne just as
she has done.
The other antagonists of
Dishonored 2 operate along these
same themes, as each of the four
coconspirators of Delilah’s coup can
be undone by the doubles they use to
exert control. Grim Alex, a Jekyll-
and-Hyde creation of Hypatia’s own
research, is banished by that same
method. Jindosh’s machines turn on
him and destroy the intellect that
created them. Breanna Ashworth has
her magical ability torn away by the
same efﬁgies she crafted to
supernaturally inﬂuence others. Duke
Abele is replaced by the literal body
double he uses to avoid the
consequences of his wasteful and
thoughtless lifestyle. Even Paolo and
Byrne, ﬁghting over a patch of dusty
territory in the once-grand Batista
District, now stare each other down
through a cloud of dust that obscur
the mirrored nature of their
relationship. In each case, these
doubles, all created by a ruthless
pursuit of power and used eithe
directly or indirectly to harm ot

Delilah, in turn, is undone by t
double she creates in Emily.

throne, just as she dreamed, her 
desires are unclear at the game’s 
opening. But playing as Emily 
Kaldwin unfolds a narrative 
concerned with these mechanisms by 
which our desires are formed. 
Suddenly thrust into a recreation of 
Delilah’s story – one of death, 
deprivation, and disempowerment at 
the hands of a family member – 
Emily is forced to confront her 
reasons for wanting the throne. 
Before the coup, she was a poor ruler, 
but a nonlethal, low-Chaos 
playthrough shows a young woman 
coming to understand the depths of 
her obligation to the people she has 
hitherto ignored. In contrast with the 
Duke and with Delilah, Emily vows 
to be a better Empress not because 
she wants power, but because she 
cultivates compassion. But in a 
violent, high-Chaos playthrough, it 
becomes increasingly clear that a 
desire for revenge against Delilah 
eclipses Emily’s pursuit of what she 
lost. Through this, Emily imitates 
Delilah to the point of becoming 
indistinguishable from her 
murderous aunt.
EMILY’S CHOICE
Regardless of playstyle, when Emily 
approaches Dunwall Tower in the 
ﬁnal mission she is confronted with 
the realisation that her position is the 
same as Delilah’s before the coup: a 
deposed empress taking back what 
she believes is rightfully hers. 
Dunwall is a ruin when Emily 
returns, with the infrastructure 
crumbling and the streets littered 
with the dead. Delilah, unconcerned 
ruling the Empire. And while her
story is one in which she seeks
restitution for a childhood wrong
that caused her so much misery and
pain, she is unable to see the imitative
nature of her desire and, in turn,
visits the same misery and pain upon
Emily. The object of desire – the
throne and all its power – is quickly
obscured when the relationships that
form around it are based on envy,
spite and imitation. And while a
high-Chaos playthrough of
Dishonored 2 simply replaces one
tyrant for another, a conscientious
playthrough sees the young Emily
Kaldwin resisting the easy urge of
imitative desire and instead growing
as a ruler and a woman. Delilah,
meanwhile, becomes trapped within
her own desires of an immortal rule
within her painted world, unaware
and unconcerned that she lives out a
simple imitation.

The land that adored her half-sister 
does not adore her – therefore she 
tries to create another through magic.

instead. In a high-Chaos playthrough, 
Emily ends the game by ruling over a 
land in disarray, ﬁlled with the

doesn’t hesitate to kill in her

How THE WITCHER III: WILD HUNT deals with religion and belief. 
By Emily Marlow
DEFENDER  
of the  
FAITH 
T
here is a long history 
of religion in games, 
and RPGs provide a 
good space for 
conversations about 
faith that could have felt ﬂippant in 
other genres. In The Witcher III, 
religion is more than just window 
dressing. Set in a world outgrowing 
magic, the game depicts religion in 
varied ways: tackling philosophy, 
corruption and misconception, 
while allowing room for players to 
interact with gods, decide peoples’ 
fate and support or condemn 
religious practices.
Geralt’s own beliefs, or lack thereof, 
are notable, as he must regularly 
interact with religious characters. 
Geralt is magical, yet wouldn’t likely 
describe himself as a magic user, and 
has a distaste for certain elements of 
the practice. Despite this, Geralt can 
be played as a supporter of religion, 
(and his aversion to magic isn’t so 
strong that he wouldn’t date a 
sorceress or two).

The Witcher III
FE ATU RE

It’s telling that the majority of quests in which you 
interact with members of the Church of Eternal Fire are 
negative. There’s corruption, fanaticism and racially-
motivated murder, not unlike the Crusades carried out by 
the Roman Catholic Church in the Middle Ages.
A roadside priest tasks Geralt with burning the bodies 
of dead soldiers in one of the ﬁrst quests to include the 
Church. On the surface, this seems like a standard ‘go 
here, do this, come back for a reward’ quest. However, 
when one of the bodies turns out to be not quite dead, it’s 
revealed that the priest is actually getting you to burn the 
evidence of his illegal ﬁsstech trade. If you confront the 
priest and refuse to accept his bribe to look the other way, 
you’re forced into a three-on-one ﬁght, but with a larger 
reward if you win. Maybe this is the game suggesting this 
is the ethical choice to make, but the implication is the 
same: corruption and organised religion go hand in hand
in the world of The Witcher III.
Magic is often used as a way of portraying seemingly 
religious rituals within games. Think of Yuna’s 
summoning of the spirits of the dead in Final Fantasy X, 
or the magic used to resurrect characters in World of 
Warcraft. Magic rituals are performed repeatedly in 
Skyrim, another game that, similar to The Witcher III, 
uses standing stones as a source of power. The Witcher 
III’s own Places of Power are quite similar to those we see 
today at Stonehenge or Avebury.
Also of note is that Geralt recharges himself by 
meditating. While meditation today does not have to be 
directly linked to religion or belief, meditation has been a 
core aspect of multiple religions, from Buddhism to 
Christianity, since ancient times. Geralt’s relationship with 
religion and faith is a constant foil to his character, a 
reﬂecting point that the game repeatedly dwells on. The 
Witcher III repeatedly asks us what we believe by
challenging Geralt’s own beliefs.

JOIN THE CHURCH!
FINAL
FANTASY X
The corruption of
the church of Yevon
forms a large part of
FFX. Despite being a
religion most of your
party follow, it’s
revealed to be a
sham. Also, there’s a
giant whale called
‘Sin’ who turns out
to be the
protagonist’s dad.
DR AGON AGE:
INQUISITION
Religion is a central
theme, with the
choice between
refusing or
accepting
hero-worship left up
to the player. You
can believe that you
have been chosen to
save the world, but,
as the game lets you
know, you haven’t.
FALLOUT 4
In the wasteland,
religious belief
doesn’t get any
stranger than the
Children of the
Atom, a cult which
worships atomic
bombs. These
zealots like to
expose others to the
‘Glow’, also known as
face-melting nuclear
radiation.
MATTERS OF FAITH
The Witcher III presents us with 
many different forms of belief. The 
Church of the Eternal Fire, for 
instance, is depicted as civilised but 
corrupt, operating with near-
medieval cruelty. For the Church of 
the Eternal Fire, religion is all about 
appearances. Sitting at the highest 
peak of the city of Novigrad, in a 
wealthy neighbourhood, the church 
is ever-so-subtly painted gold. You 
can’t go into the building yourself, so 
there’s no way to know what kind of 
rituals go on in there. By separating 
the church itself from the player, the 
organisation gives off a feeling of 
inaccessibility. It’s clear that Geralt 
isn’t welcome, and if the multiple 
scenes of people burning at the stake 
for being magical don’t get the point 
across, the sneering remarks of the 
rich churchgoers do. 
Quests that revolve around 
folklore are more open-ended. In 
Velen, rituals are common roadside 
occurrences, frequently featured in 
quests that ask you to protect people 
during acts of worship, or participate 
in them yourself. 
In ‘A Greedy God’, Geralt comes 
across a destroyed building which is 
now the site of worship for a local 
deity (imaginatively called the 
Allgod). Villagers are complaining 
that the Allgod has cursed them for 
not providing adequate offerings. 
With a little digging you discover that 
the assumed deity is actually a sylvan 
living in a cellar underneath the 
worship site, greedily scofﬁng the 
villagers’ offerings. Sylvans are 
traditionally woodland spirits or 
deities – relations to the Roman god 
of woods and ﬁelds, Silvanus (not to 
be confused with the Blizzard 
character of a similar name). 
56  
  MARCH 2018
ABOVE: The Church 
of the Eternal Fire is 
not all it seems to be.

This quest is often described as funny, yet your options 
for what to do once you’ve discovered that the deity is a 
monster scamming his way into obesity aren’t great. If you 
kill the sylvan, you gleefully tell the villagers that you have 
righted the wrongs against them. They were being ﬂeeced 
after all, and now they’re free! The villagers react badly to 
this – they think they’ve been doomed and rush off to 
organise a group prayer session.
If you tell them to check the cellar below, you’ll later 
discover they followed your advice, 
confronted the sylvan, and are now 
all dead. The only way to please both 
parties is to threaten the sylvan but 
not kill it, effectively maintaining a 
lie, but keeping everyone alive. The 
game doesn’t comment either way, so 
we’re left wondering: is that a 
positive result? Have you saved 
anyone or really achieved anything? 
Does Geralt even care? 
MAKING A BELIEVER
In ‘Defender of the Faith’, Geralt is asked to ﬁx a series of 
shrines that have been vandalised. There’s little reason for 
you to actually do this quest – it doesn’t add to the overall 
story of the game – but as Geralt is told by the villager 
who hires him, if he doesn’t help out, the local children 
will grow warts and the dogs will get the mange. 
Geralt doesn’t want to go out of his way, and that’s 
understandable for a man with a policy of ‘live and let live’ 
when it comes to religious practices. And besides, this 
isn’t strictly Witcher-work – he’s not a religious 
repairman. As it turns out, though, the true villains of this 
quest are the worst monsters of all… students from 
Oxenfurt Academy quoting Nietzsche and Marx 
(“Religion is the opiate of the masses!”). 
It’s clear that Geralt thinks this is a waste of his time. 
“Sheesh, students!” he exclaims, rolling his eyes. Yet he 
never truly condemns the belief aspect of this quest. Here 
we get to see both extremes of an argument about faith: 
from an elderly woman who believes that wooden shrines 
will ensure good health, to students who think destroying 
said shrines will force the locals into a life free of 
superstition. This quest lays the foundation for a conﬂict 
that reemerges throughout the entire game: the pagan 
beliefs of down-on-their-luck villagers, against the more 
atheistic views of their well-off counterparts.
Despite making a fantasy RPG about magic and belief, 
at times it feels as if CD Projekt Red thinks the majority of 
its audience are sceptics. Stories of villagers sending their 
children to mysterious witches in the middle of a swamp, 
in the hope it will bring them good 
fortune, are presented as being wildly 
superstitious. The Ladies of the 
Wood are at the heart of one of The 
Witcher III’s most beloved series of 
quests, presented as a terrifying 
reality in the shape of an old wives’ 
tale. The fact that the Ladies are 
proven to be horribly real, and that 
they eat children whilst dancing 
naked around a cauldron, feels like a 
smack in a doubter’s face. 
The Witcher III does this time and time again: showing 
us something completely fantastical, allowing us to revel 
in doubt and suspicion, before pulling back the curtain 
and revealing it all to be true. Geralt is often sceptical of 
the problems he’s brought in to solve – “A ghost is ruining 
our water supply!” “A villager has turned into a 
werewolf!” “The witches in the swamp are eating 
children” – yet they’re all real. It’s as if we’re being told to 
look closer into what we assume is the stuff of fairytales. 
By comparing the natural wildness of pagan belief with 
the rigid cruelty of organised cults, we’re being shown 
that not everything fantastical is fantasy and not 
everything reputable is respectable. 
Despite having a sceptic for a protagonist, The 
Witcher III depicts religion in a surprisingly even-handed 
way. It portrays a medieval church that’s clearly meant to 
resemble historical realities, and pagan belief systems that 
replicate both fairy tales and real-life rituals. We’re never 
given a clear sense of who or what to believe, which 
unlike the many RPGs that have come before it, leaves the 
choice up to us.

RE VIE W

It’s a competitive game governed by
semi-randomised systems that can 
feel capricious, but PUBG works in 
part because it throws conventional 
balance out the window. You’re cast 
into a maelstrom of unfairness, trying 
to be the last-person-
standing amongst 100 
competitors. The 
normal way to die is 
suddenly, from an 
unknown direction. 
As a shooter, it is the
opposite of the kind of 
mathematical, 
chessboard balance 
seen in CS:GO or Rainbow Six Siege, 
where a comparatively ﬁnite number 
of variables narrows decision-making. 
The only time this happens in PUBG 
is when you reach the ﬁnal circle, 
where the play area becomes small 
enough to ﬁt in your brain. 
And yet, something wonderful 
happens as a result of PUBG’s scale 
and randomness: you accept that you 
probably won’t win. Failure is the 
expectation. Death is inevitable, so 
hey: you might as well make meaning 
out of the death you’re given. 
Technical issues, uneven art and
pesky cheaters erode that fun, but 
with the pressure to win somewhat 
lifted, PUBG becomes a playground 
for giving and receiving peril. 
HIDE AND SEEK
I’m happiest when I 
get to harass a team 
that can’t locate me. 
There’s an art to it. 
You’ve got to pick a 
great spot: ideally a 
nook between some 
wreckage, with at least 
a 4X scope and a 
suppressor afﬁxed to your gun. You 
have to pick the right moment to 
engage, and to do that, you have to 
read the body language of your 
enemy. Where are they headed? Are 
they on alert, or at ease? If I’m lucky, 
I can catch them while they’re 
exchanging gear – a huge opportunity 
to put shots on someone while they 
have an empty AR in their hands.
I don’t care if I win or lose in 
these situations, which is weird 
considering how cutthroat PUBG is. 
The population count in the top-right 
corner of the screen is a constant 
reminder of how close you are to 
being crossed off a list, and how 
much competition you have. Loot 
box currency is on the line, too – 
winning and eliminating players 
earns Battle Points, which can be 
spent on cosmetic item crates ﬁlled 
with mostly dull shirts and pants. 
Despite PUBG’s booming skirt 
economy, loot boxes are probably the 
last thing on your mind. Most people 
I play with measure success by how 
much trouble they get into – whether 
your match generates a good Twitch 
clip, whether you were able to get 
revenge on the group that KO’d your 
friend, or whether you took the 
opportunity to backﬂip your 
motorcycle off a hill at the least 
appropriate moment. The mindset 
PUBG cultivates in its players – let’s 
call it ‘casually competitive’ – may be 
its biggest achievement.
That doesn’t undercut its status as 
a skilful shooter, with many merit 
badges to earn: cartography, looting, 
boating, tactical driving, parachuting, 
cross country, sieging, spotting, ﬁrst 
aid, airdrop retrieval, boxing. The 
breadth of verbs and microskills 
makes PUBG a richer experience 
over time because it always feels like 
there’s another trick to learn about 
driving, vaulting, grenading, 
whatever. I also like that distributing 
duties among a three or four-person 
squad is itself a skill: hand the scoped 
Kar-98 to your best shot, and the keys 
to the Dacia to your daredevil.
Shooting has surprising depth. 
Despite its spacious maps, winning a 
duel at short range takes about the 
same skill as you’d need on de_dust2. 
Damage is modelled differently 
across the body, limbs and head. 
Guns have touchy recoil and bullet 
travel time. Check Twitch on a 
weekday and you’ll see CS:GO ex-pro 
Shroud at the top of the channel list, 
preﬁring around cover and pulling off 
sick spray transfers.
Luckily for those of us without 
divine aim, it isn’t everything. What’s 
more gratifying about PUBG’s

RE VIE W

gunﬁghts to me is the ad-libbing and 
creativity it takes to manage the 
complex situations it puts you in. Say 
someone’s ambushed you from a 
second-story window – they’ve 
tagged your friend, who’s now 
incapacitated behind a tree. Do you 
pop a smoke grenade and run to 
revive them, or ﬁght from where 
you’re standing? Maybe your third 
teammate could put some 
suppression into the windows of the 
building while you rush in, but wait, 
you can’t be sure how many friends 
this attacker might have. And look, 
there’s a vehicle parked at the bottom 
of the building – should you pop its 
tyres to prevent a getaway, or keep it 
intact for your squad? 
Decisiveness is a skill, and PUBG 
is a platform for dumb 
schemes and accidental
bravery. The best areas 
of PUBG’s two maps 
promote this stuff, like 
the school on Erangel, 
or Pecado and 
Hacienda del Patrón on
Miramar: sprawling 
compounds with 
hiding spots, escape holes, ambush 
perches and other traps waiting to be 
sprung. Unfortunately, it’s indoors 
where some of the combat falls apart. 
Melee is clumsy, relegated to 
desperation or taunting. Almost all 
surfaces are impenetrable. Footstep 
audio doesn’t have enough ﬁdelity to 
make hearing a reliable sense, making 
it hard to be certain whether 
someone’s above or below you. 
Another gripe is that the level of 
visual polish varies a lot between the 
weapons. When you feed ammo into 
an empty AKM, your left arm reaches 
across your body to smack the 
charging handle, a nice detail. But 
some iron sights, like that of the 
M416, are blocky and low-res. The 
shotguns are unpleasant, unreliable, 
and hard to read. Worst, PUBG’s scale 
means that my framerate still 
occasionally dips by 20 fps at an 
inopportune moment, although 
hardware performance has improved 
tremendously since its early months.
These problems melt away at long 
range, where I think PUBG is at its 
best. My favourite phase in a match is 
about ten minutes before the 
endgame, when anyone still alive is 
geared to the gills but the circle is big 
enough that engagements are 
happening through scopes. Each shot 
across a long canyon or ﬁeld is a 
parabolic prayer – the target might’ve 
shifted three feet by the time your 
shot travels 300 meters and burrows 
into the dust. Hitting someone on the 
run at this distance 
convinces you you’re 
the spawn of Neo and 
Robin Hood, gifted 
with precognition. It 
feels damn good. 
OUT OF THE BLUE
PUBG’s simplest 
system is also its most 
important. Every couple of minutes, a 
new, smaller safe zone is declared, 
telescoping within the area of the 
previous one. If you’re blessed, 
successive safe zones will seem to 
mirror your position. Anyone caught 
outside takes damage over time, and 
has to migrate under pressure. This 
asphyxiating grip PUBG exerts on its 
map is the force that puts its 
mechanics in motion. It works 
wonderfully, forcing players out of 
comfort zones, encouraging mistakes, 
limiting how much looting you can 
do, and making the value of your real 
estate uncertain. Without this sense 
of urgency, PUBG would be dull.
It’s also artiﬁcial to the point of 
dissonance. No attempt is made to 
explain the origin of the blue electric 
ﬁeld, the setting or why you’re 
ﬁghting to the death. Absent of 
rudimentary narrative handholds 
(the vaguely post-apocalyptic setting 
doesn’t offer many clues), PUBG can 
feel hollow of personality, especially 
with each custom character issuing 
the same thousand-yard stare 
regardless of their situation. There is 
some upside to this story vacuum: 
you ﬁll the void with your tales of 
heroism and idiocy.
PUBG’s guarantee of intensity is 
one of its best features, but it’s also 
pleasantly lazy. When 100 players are 
consolidated into teams of four, 
paranoia shrinks and the mood 
relaxes considerably as you wander 
around absorbing gear. If an 
early-game bloodbath thins the 
server population, you might spend 
15 minutes of a match wandering 
with your friends, exchanging loot, 
seeing and hearing no one, shooting 
the shit about work or what else 
you’ve been playing. 
There’s surprising space for 
socialising, and it makes PUBG a rare 
multiplayer game with good pacing. 
The airdrop is an initial burst of 
excitement before lower-key 
migration and looting sets in, 
punctuated by ambushes that lead up 
to a crescendo ﬁnale. I ﬁnd it best in 
duos or trios, where the ratio 
between shit-shooting and shooting 
shit feels equal. As a foursome, 
combat can feel overcomplicated, and 
the endgame more asymmetrical, 
where the ﬁnal dozen players might 
be a squad of four facing off against 
eight orphaned survivors.
In all modes of play, PUBG allows 
you to set your own risk level, 
beginning with the opening jump. 
You learn the hotspots quickly: the 
military base, Georgopol, and school 
are magnets for conﬁdent, deadly

WIDELY KNOWN
Months into PUBG’s lifespan, it broke 
records for concurrent players on 
Steam. Success threatened to be its 
biggest obstacle – few games commit 
to exiting Steam’s pre-release 
program in just nine months, I can’t 
think of any others that have become 
phenomena, run multiple major 
esports events, launched on console 
and introduced microtransaction 
systems on their way to doing it. 
For the most part PUBG has 
navigated its growing pains well, but 
there are still a few major issues. 
Hacking is the biggest concern. 
Depending on who you ask, PUBG is 
either experiencing a pandemic of 
cheaters or not at all. A natural 
downside of PUBG’s 100-player 
capacity is that it gives hackers more 
room to hide than your average FPS. 
But on December 28, the anti-cheat 
service employed by PUBG, BattlEye, 
noted that 1.5 million accounts had 
been banned.
Anecdotally, I’ve struggled to spot 
clear examples of hacking. In 31 
recent ﬁrst-person squad and solo 
games, 14 of which I 
survived into the ﬁnal 
ten, I didn’t encounter 
any bad apples. I have 
witnessed a few clear 
incidents on 
livestreams where 
players manage 
unnatural headshot 
accuracy, or seem able 
to track location through terrain and 
walls. There’s a reporting tool and 
killcam system for managing this, but 
ﬂagging someone after losing an 
unfair gunﬁght doesn’t feel like 
revenge. In January, PUBG Corp 
announced its intention to ban 
100,000 players. I’m unsure if that’s 
comforting or concerning.
Hacking isn’t the only problem 
– PUBG still has an assortment of 
bugs. Both maps have collision issues 
with vehicles. You might clip an 
invisible piece of terrain and go ﬂying 
down a hill, grimacing as your vehicle 
barely lands on its feet. But driving 
over the same hill or bump in your 
next match, the collision gods might 
direct their wrath at you, 
trampolining your UAZ into the air 
and detonating it.
A few less-spectacular issues eat 
away at the fun. When leaping off a 
ledge, in rare cases PUBG will 
register the fall twice, inﬂicting 
double damage. Parachuting is 
similarly awkward, as PUBG 
struggles to sync your position if you 
clip a roof or ledge. In a few spots, 
gear disappears through the ground. 
And at extreme ranges, you may be 
able to spot a player but be unable to 
shoot them, as a rock fails to render.
The true trouble is network 
performance, which isn’t a match for 
PUBG’s emphasis on 
precision. As diagnosed 
in detail by experts like 
Battle(non)sense, the 
average server tickrate 
(around 20Hz) isn’t 
just slightly lower than 
we’d expect, it’s also 
inconsistent 
throughout play, which 
makes hit registration feel uneven. 
You might absorb a shot after you 
made it behind cover, or see a blood 
effect trigger a second after you tag 
someone. It’s worst when the 
netcode and animations don’t shake 
hands – I’ve died several times to 
players who look like they’re facing 
away from me, which makes me 
think I have an extra second to aim 
before they suddenly dome me.
The poky netcode isn’t a huge 
distraction for me, but because there 
isn’t a network overlay or the ability 
to check pings, it’s frustratingly hard 
to diagnose the problem on your 
own. At least servers are broken into 
regions, though I’d like to see PUBG 
go a step further and soft-lock players 
with a certain ping from joining 
servers outside their region.
PERFORMANCE PRESSURE
On the hardware side, I’m pretty 
happy with the state of PUBG’s 
performance. Although framerate 
dips are common, the game doesn’t 
crater for me in the way that some 
sandbox games do, despite cities and 
vistas dotted with thousands of 
objects. On a GTX 980Ti at 1440p 
and ultra settings, I manage more 
than 70fps. On a modest rig, with 
graphics turned to their minimum 
setting at 1080p, I can hit 60fps on a 
variety of cards, from a GTX 1050 
and GTX 680 to AMD’s R9 380 or 
RX 560. PUBG’s settings themselves 
are ﬂexible, but not exceptionally so. 
There’s a 144 fps cap that I’d love to 
see removed or replaced with locked 
framerate options. The addition of 
three colourblind modes is good, and 
ﬁrst-person FOV caps at a
comfortable 103.
Taking it as a whole, PUBG is an 
achievement in contradictory 
brutality and breathing room. It’s a 
hypercompetitive sandbox shooter 
where you can be killed from half a 
kilometre away without any warning. 
It also has an autorun button so you 
can take a bite of your sandwich or 
shout thanks to your most recent 
Twitch subscribers. PUBG has plenty 
of issues to address before it exits 
adolescence, but its mixture of 
nonchalance and intensity is deep, 
respectful of your time, and a reliable 
story generator.

RE VIE W

Imagine a set of wall tiles whose
intricate patterns perfectly line up to
create undulating lines and strange 
optical effects. That precision and 
elegance is what Roberts is 
maintaining across an entire story. 
Chunks of interiors and exteriors 
match perfectly 
without seeming out of
place in either of their 
respective scenes: an 
image in a thought 
bubble lines up with a 
balcony scene; a star in
the sky is positioned 
perfectly so that it 
peeps through the gap 
in an overlaid tile and becomes the 
light from a lamp. 
The fact that it works so smoothly 
hides the skill involved. Moment-to-
moment, the feeling isn’t of awe, it’s 
of a kind of peaceful academic 
curiosity. That sense is supported by 
the aesthetic – an illustration style 
which leans into a pale palette and an 
austerity I associate with 
neoclassicism, with monumental 
graveyard sculpture, with meticulous 
architectural drawings documenting 
antiquity with timeless clean lines.
The story itself is an interesting,
ambiguous framework through
which to explore the idea of 
repeating patterns. You aren’t quite 
seeing the underpinnings of the 
game’s universe so much as you’re 
tuning into refrains that recur across 
time and scale – 
coherence rather than 
transparency. I will say 
that my awareness of 
the narrative came and 
went depending on 
how much of my 
attention was dedicated 
to solving a puzzle. 
As a result, I’m 
looking forward to my second 
playthrough, where I can move 
through the tile sequences more 
ﬂuently having solved them once 
before. That’ll free me up to focus on 
the story and see what I missed the 
ﬁrst time around.
In terms of the interface itself, you 
have anywhere from one to four tiles 
to play with at a given moment. You 
can zoom in, zoom out, pan up, 
down, left and right, and some tiles 
can be layered on top of one another. 
The relatively small number of 
objects and options means that the 
speciﬁc puzzle game frustration 
where you can’t see the way to 
progress is reduced. 
That’s not to say it’s entirely 
absent. I had moments where I 
simply couldn’t see a connection, or 
where I’d missed a vital way to 
change one tile and started to feel 
that rising tide of irritation. None of 
them lasted long, but being able to 
ﬂow through those segments of the 
story instead of butting my head 
against them is adding to the appeal 
of that second playthrough. 
PATTERN RECOGNITION
I was actually wondering whether 
frustration could form an interesting 
part of Gorogoa in a way that differs 
from the normal point-and-click and 
puzzle game frustration. The game is 
structured around seeing these 
connections in the world, and 
frustration linked in an interesting 
way to moments I remember from 
undergraduate maths classes where 
you’d catch a glimpse of a universal 
connection within the abstracted 
fabric and then lose the thread. 
I know that Roberts felt that a 
degree of challenge in ﬁnding hidden 
patterns in Gorogoa was important. 
It’s part of creating the sense that 
they are indeed hidden patterns, but I 
get the sense that it wouldn’t have 
extended to outright frustration. 
Gorogoa rewards your persistence 
with delightful elegant mechanisms. 
In terms of its niche in gaming, I’d 
put it as a counterpoint to something 
like Amanita’s upcoming surreal 
puzzle toybox, Chuchel. In both 
you’re interacting to progress, letting 
the worlds unfurl in unexpected and 
wonderful directions, but where 
Chuchel is warmly comedic, Gorogoa 
is austere and elegant.

Once the tiles line up the 
scenes play out and change.
Some panes act as windows 
to reposition.
The ultimate aim is to 
collect five coloured fruits.
Seemingly separate scenes 
play out in different tiles.
The little boy is the
character you’re guiding.

It’s an idea with a lot of promise: 
Alien: Isolation by way of The ’Burbs 
and Home Alone. Unfortunately, 
Hello Neighbor doesn’t deliver: after 
months in alpha, the launch version 
is buggy, inconsistent and frustrating. 
The initial charm of the
art style and premise 
quickly gives way to 
trial-and-error 
drudgery.
There’s no real 
distinction to be made 
between the 
neighbour’s dynamism 
and his inconsistency. 
He has no routine that you can plan 
around or disrupt. Hello Neighbor 
doesn’t clearly communicate what he 
can see, what he will be disturbed by 
or what will trigger a search. I’ve had 
him ignore me because I’ve got one 
ankle concealed in an inch of shadow, 
and I’ve had him launch at me like a 
missile from 20 yards away when I 
was sure he was looking away.
H
ello Neighbor makes for a great elevator pitch. You play as a
suburban kid in a Pixar-like neighbourhood where 
something sinister lurks beneath the bright colours and 
exaggerated lines. In the opening, you witness your 
middle-aged neighbour behaving strangely, shouting and 
boarding up his basement. Your task is to invade his house and discover his 
secret, using stealth and trickery to evade an ostensibly reactive opponent.
Each level has a ﬁxed solution, 
with limited room for meaningful 
decision making. Once you’ve ﬁgured 
out the sequence of blocks to stack, 
doors to unblock, tools to ﬁnd, power 
switches to ﬂip and pipes to tinker 
with, Hello Neighbor 
devolves into trial-and-
error solution attempts. 
As such, getting reset 
to the start of the level 
is a more effective way 
of shedding the 
neighbour’s attention 
than trying to engage 
with Hello Neighbor as 
a stealth game – a sign that this isn’t a 
stealth game at all.
Instead, Hello Neighbor is best 
thought of as a puzzle game where 
you’re frequently sent back to the 
start of a section with little you can 
do about it. Puzzling also suffers from 
ﬂoaty movement, inconsistent 
physics and bugs – such as key items 
vanishing – that can derail your 
progress. Some solutions are 
inventive, but the stop-start way in 
which you work towards them robs 
the game of any charm.
TWITCHY CURTAINS
As Hello Neighbor progresses it 
becomes stranger, and the solutions 
to its puzzles move further away 
from the core premise. The house 
grows into a teetering, unlikely 
labyrinth full of egregious leaps of 
logic – think full-on Gabriel Knight 3 
cat moustache territory.
There’s potential here, and when 
you’re creeping through the 
neighbour’s kitchen listening for the 
sounds of him moving about in 
another room you get a sense for the 
home-invasion adventure this could 
have been. But then something goes 
wrong and the illusion breaks. An 
enthused YouTuber might be able to 
summon it back for the beneﬁt of 
their audience, but for the regular 
player Hello Neighbor doesn’t earn 
that kind of investment.

That’s not a flashlight: 
this is a flashlight!
More chore 
than challenge.
This is also a flashlight.


In case you’ve managed to miss it
during its three years in Early Access, 
or at the dozens of gaming events 
where it’s been showcased, Gang 
Beasts pits a group of wobbly ﬁghters 
against one another across a variety 
of compact arenas. 
Boneloaf’s clumsy, 
tottering avatars are 
deliberately awkward 
to control, and the 
scraps play out like 
drunken altercations at 
chucking-out time – all 
missed headbutts, 
amateurish grappling 
and the occasional lucky haymaker 
laying someone out cold. 
The controls are intuitive and 
offer a broader moveset than you 
might ﬁrst think. It’s weirdly hard to 
land a regular kick, but combine it 
with a jump at the right time and you 
can knock an opponent ﬂying. You 
can throw a left or right jab, but the 
same buttons can also be used to grab 
hold of people, railings, cones, girders 
or ledges. You can even climb walls, 
releasing your grip with one hand
and hitting jump to swing upward.
In practice, most matches devolve 
into button-mashing, as you grab and 
fall over one another, never sure who
has the upper hand at any given 
moment. Amid the 
ﬂailing of arms, legs 
and heads, one of you 
will go limp, but the 
lack of any real 
feedback will rarely let 
you know why. When 
someone is prone, the 
race is on to lift them 
up and throw them to 
their doom before they successfully 
shake off their concussion. Even 
when all seems lost, you can enjoy 
the catharsis of taking a rival down 
with you by clinging onto an arm or 
leg as you’re dangling over the edge. 
KILLING FIELDS
The stages present as much of a 
threat as any opponent. One has giant 
chutes that open and close beneath 
your feet; another has collapsing 
ﬂoors; a third puts you all on thin ice 
ﬂoes, forcing everyone to race toward 
the only solid ground: a bobbing 
buoy. In one stage, you’re trapped 
within a glass elevator, and can smash 
the sides or clamber through a hatch 
before headbutting the cables and 
grabbing hold as they snap, sending 
those inside plunging to their deaths. 
All of which makes it a hoot of a 
local multiplayer game. It’s a giggle 
with two players, and appreciably 
funnier with four. But that was true 
three years ago, and many of the 
same ﬂaws are still present. Levels 
have blind spots – during one online 
game, I was kicked for inactivity 
when I survived a fall by clinging 
onto the back of a building, with no 
way of seeing where I was to pull 
myself up. The presentation is 
barebones, and the other game types 
lay bare Gang Beast’s ﬂaws. The 
infuriating Waves mode pits you 
against a series of ludicrously capable 
AI opponents; it took me four games 
to win a single round, and even that 
felt like a ﬂuke. The woolliness of the 
controls and the feeble feedback are 
harder to forgive when the playing 
ﬁeld doesn’t feel level. 
Online play is a bit of a bust, too. 
Matchmaking can take a while, but 
the real problem is that Gang Beasts’ 
clumsiness needs to be shared with 
others: feeding off the yelps of 
frustration from a friend or family 
member is all part of the fun. Against 
unknowns, that in-built frustration 
overwhelms the slapstick. It’s here 
you realise why it’s been received so 
well at events: it’s the kind of game 
people can crowd around and laugh 
themselves silly for ten minutes and 
then forget about it until the next 
event rolls around. Three years on, 
Gang Beasts is still that kind of game. 
But it’s not much more than that.

Before the Storm takes characters
from Life is Strange and digs into 
their lives a few years prior. The main 
focus this time is Chloe Price; a 
gawky ball of unresolved grief, an 
exuder of teen rage and a serial 
player of hooky. We 
join her after the death
of her father, William, 
just as class princess, 
Rachel Amber, crashes 
into her life.
To give a broad 
verdict for those who 
don’t want to risk 
spoilers, Before the 
Storm offers a more streamlined 
experience than its predecessor, 
prioritising conversation over 
puzzle-solving and ﬂeshing out the 
relationship which is at the root of 
most of the action in Life is Strange. It 
leans harder into genre tropes and, as 
a result, its greatest strengths are 
intrinsically linked to its most 
pronounced weaknesses. 
One of the things I loved about 
the original game was how it seemed 
to embrace the tropes of original teen 
ﬁction which used to rub along in 
subsections of fanﬁction websites. 
That’s not a strand of ﬁction which 
usually gets space in gaming outside 
indie projects and I’ve seen it mocked  
and derided; lumped in with casual
dismissals of everything on Tumblr.
That tranche of ﬁction can be 
overly dramatic, self-serving or 
steeped in wish fulﬁlment. Despite 
that (and because of that) you’ll also 
ﬁnd spaces where 
people are ﬁguring 
themselves out, writing 
their identities into 
being, having 
confrontations they 
can’t have in real life, 
conjuring up escapes 
from the frustration of 
adolescence, being 
their own heroes. 
The ﬁrst Life is Strange used that 
as the lens through which to unfurl 
its tale of gigantic storms and time 
jiggery-pokery. Before The Storm sees 
developer Deck Nine take up 
Dontnod’s tale. It offers a similar 
character-driven adventure with light 
puzzling but cranks the tropiness up 
and the game ends up better and 
worse than the original as a result. 
I far prefer being Chloe to playing 
as Max. I like her anger and her 
action. I enjoyed hanging out with 
Rachel Amber and watching her 
relationship with Chloe erupt with 
the bewildering intensity I remember 
from being that age. 
There are also some ace scenes – 
Chloe can have a foray into D&D 
which made me laugh out loud, 
there’s a people-watching improv 
segment which reminded me of 
doing the same thing with a friend I 
haven’t seen in years, and there are so 
many little moments of sincerity 
where the body language and the 
efforts of the characters to connect 
with each other feel just right. 
There is also plenty of wish 
fulﬁlment. While Life is Strange 
wound its storytelling around a 
central mystery, Before the Storm 
hones in on Chloe and Rachel’s story. 
The ﬁrst game (or at least my own 
canon playthrough) supported 
satisfying ambiguities with regard to 
relationships. This time I went 
headlong into romance. It was great. 
Dramatic and sincere and absolutely 
replete with moments designed to be 
screengrabbed, rendered as fan art or 
converted into gifs.
GIRL ALOUD
Losing the storm story means the 
previous time rewind mechanic has 
been replaced with a backtalk 
challenge. In practice I found this to 
be a little hit and miss because you’re 
essentially arguing your way through 
a scene in a pretty artiﬁcial way. But 
it felt like a decent ﬁt for Chloe’s 
character. Where Max is the exact 
sort of person who would want to 
painstakingly relive each and every 
moment to do the right thing and 
have the right answer, Chloe would 
deﬁnitely just shout at the problem 
until it stopped being a problem.

Then there are the segments 
where Before The Storm doesn’t 
exactly miss the mark, but I suspect 
playing it when I was 15 as opposed 
to in my 30s would have signiﬁcantly 
altered my response.
Current Pip thinks that there’s 
deﬁnitely such a thing as too much 
pathetic fallacy. Current Pip is also 
burnt out on school plays as devices 
for teenagers to express their feelings, 
attractive people who don’t realise 
they’re attractive suddenly revealing 
an unlikely level of proﬁciency in 
some constructive or creative ﬁeld, 
meaningful dream sequences, and 
conversations about starlight. 
I do remember when those 
moments would have been just the 
right amount of over-the-top, but for 
me nowadays they tend towards 
heavy-handedness. (That said, I also 
stuffed my screenshot folder with 
moments from those sequences.)
That heavy-handedness also holds 
true when it comes to the more 
threatening moments in the game. 
They are in line with the rest of the 
drama but I found the relish in 
extreme expressions of bad  
situations uncomfortable. 
Partly that’s because Before the 
Storm sometimes wanders into 
simplistic melodrama with 
pantomime villains (as did its 
predecessor). But 
partly it’s because the 
game has played out 
against the backdrop of 
#MeToo. I’ve found it 
harder to watch 
violence and abuse in 
entertainment 
generally because of 
the relentless 
reminders of its presence in day-to-
day life – they’re harder to separate. 
Life is Strange as a series also makes 
me let my guard down because I love 
those characters, so blows land that 
little bit harder. 
On the overtly negative side, 
character movement – especially the 
running and walking animations – 
can be distractingly odd. In fact, 
characters generally have a very 
strange lack of physicality in the 
world. Sometimes that manifests as 
feet not seeming to interact with the 
ground, sometimes it’s a blow to an 
object which doesn’t make 
convincing contact. The body 
language itself manages to express 
some pretty subtle emotions, but it 
can struggle against this weirdly jerky 
movement in the characters.
Accompanying this is a stilted
element of the dialogue – there are
some unnaturally long pauses
between lines and a propensity to tell
not show. I found my mind
wandering during some scenes as
conversations took on a stop-start
quality, maundered through
exposition or were peppered with
distracting animations.
LICENSED CONTENT
There are also moments which took
me out of the game. Licence plates
are the main offender here. It’s hard
to concentrate fully on the opening
scene where Chloe is playing chicken
on the train tracks if you’re busy
rolling your eyes at the
‘1337’ plate plonked on
the front of the engine.
Same goes for the ‘BRK
BD’ plate on your
dealer’s RV and a set of
jokey plates on bikes
you encounter early on.
Nods to and teasers
for the original game
are variable. Some add context to
story and characters, others seem
more about enticing players into
picking up the other game. There are
also points where coherence or logic
are pushed to one side in service of
emotions or aesthetic.
One minor example involves the
repurposing of a night light which I
suspect will only annoy me. A more
signiﬁcant example is the character
of Chloe’s mum’s boyfriend, David.
His alternating rudeness and
vulnerability have been given no
depth or coherence, serving only to
augment, excuse or trigger situations
with other characters. How my
playthrough ended also doesn’t
dovetail with Life is Strange.
Whether you are bothered will
depend on how much disbelief you’re
willing to suspend to get a pleasing 
aesthetic or emotional payoff.
One key difference between Life Is 
Strange and Before The Storm is that 
Chloe is now voiced by Rhianna 
DeVries instead of Ashly Burch. The 
change is a result of the SAG-AFTRA 
strike, which saw union voice actors 
take action in support of changes to 
how the games industry employs and 
pays them. SAG-AFTRA was pushing 
for secondary compensation,
transparency about the nature of the 
work when signing contracts, and 
measures to help guard against injury 
during vocally stressful performances 
as part of their list of proposals.
Burch still participated in Before 
The Storm but as a consultant,

character and dialogue. The result is 
a performance I couldn’t actually 
distinguish from Burch’s Chloe. 
STRIKE THAT
In terms of the game experience, 
that’s great. In terms of labour 
politics, the substitution muddies 
how I feel about the studio and the 
game. It’s worth reading the various 
interviews and points of view online 
to make up your own mind whether 
you want to support the studio and 
this outing for the franchise.
With that caveat in place, Before 
the Storm beneﬁts from being more 
focused and more of a character 
piece than Life Is Strange. It gets rid 
of most of the clunky puzzling, 
provides emotional payoffs for Chloe 
fans, and puts a gay teenage girl front 
and centre in a valuable way.

Life is Strange: Before The Storm
RE VIE W

Opus Magnum is the latest in a series
of machine-making games to which 
developer Zach ‘Zachtronics’ Barth 
has apparently devoted his career. 
Opus Magnum is probably most 
similar to his ﬁrst and best-known, 
SpaceChem, in which 
you build chemistry 
machines. Despite 
Opus Magnum’s 
fantastical setting, in 
which you play an 
alchemist caught 
between warring 
Germanic families, this
is probably his most 
accessible game yet.
In each puzzle you’re tasked to 
produce a speciﬁc alchemical 
product. It might be booze to bolster 
an elderly soldier’s courage or a 
ladder to help stage a robbery, but 
whatever you’re making, it’s a set 
conﬁguration of elements – air, water, 
ﬁre and earth – and various types of 
metal. It’s your job to combine them 
from a predeﬁned set of elements 
and components, transmuting air into 
salt, quicksilver into higher and 
higher grades of metal. 
You perform these actions by
placing your elements and 
components on a table divided into 
hexes. You’ll use arms to pick up and 
move elements or rotate them in 
place. There are tracks which 
transport them across 
the table. There are 
glyphs which bond 
elements together 
when they pass over 
them, and some which 
transform elements 
into different ones. You
command all these 
mechanical pieces 
using rules: at the bottom of the 
screen is a sequencer in which you 
place simple commands for each 
component on the board: pick up, put 
down, move clockwise or 
counterclockwise, extend, retract, 
turn, repeat, wait. Essentially, you’re 
building machines and then 
programming them.
The magic to Opus Magnum is 
that while there are theoretical 
perfect machines, the space in which 
you construct your solution is so 
wide open that you feel like you’re 
piecing it all together yourself, and 
the restrictions are entirely common 
sense. Frustrations usually come from 
your own lack of skill rather than 
arbitrary rules, although at a high 
level the technicalities by which the 
game times and repeats instructions 
can be hard to parse.
You complete a puzzle when it 
can churn out six products to order, 
and then it’s scored against three 
criteria: the total cost of all the 
components you used, the area of the 
table you used and how many actions 
your machine took. 
AD INFINITUM
The ratings are somewhat divergent 
from one another – a fast machine 
often costs a lot, for example – so you 
have to decide for yourself which one 
you value. It’s a game for tinkerers. 
Put it this way: I had 12 hours on the 
clock when I started the second 
chapter of ﬁve; 12 hours of bragging 
over the early puzzles with my 
friends, being crushed by their own 
designs, and trying to come back with 
something superior. Puzzle games are 
rarely so competitive, and the 
pleasure in that is down to how 
broad your options are. 
The fact that Opus Magnum is 
exquisitely presented, with each arm 
and component cast in burnished 
steel and moving with faultless 
precision just seals its appeal. I could 
watch my machines’ dances of arms 
and pistons, patterns of elements 
slotting perfectly into place, forever. 
And, naturally, you can generate gifs 
to share with a click of a button. That 
simple feeling, of personal pride in a 
creation, plugs into the very best 
qualities of not only the puzzle genre 
but all of creative play. Opus Magnum 
works great because it motivates you 
to work great.

out the shape of the implant. It’s 
kinda ﬁddly, but there’s an enjoyable 
physicality to it. When it’s done I 
install it and send her on her way. 
Later, I receive an update. “I deleted 
all my social media accounts,” she 
says. “Now I am free.”
Donovan, proprietor 
of the Red Strings Club, 
makes people happy, 
too. But he does it the 
old-fashioned way: 
with booze. When a 
patron sits down you 
can see their emotions, 
and mix a drink that 
will appeal to them – to make them 
feel better or encourage them to talk 
about something difﬁcult.
Mixing cocktails is ﬁddly too, but 
again, pleasantly tactile. As you mix 
booze together you see a circle 
drifting towards the emotion you’re 
targeting. And when the circle is 
lined up you can serve the drink. 
Lifting and pouring from the bottles 
takes some getting used to, but it’s a 
fun gimmick.
Supercontinent, of course, isn’t all 
it seems. It wants to strip people of 
emotions, believing they’re a burden 
to humanity. Is there a place for 
ﬂawed creatures like us in an 
increasingly advanced, post-human 
world? The Red Strings Club tackles 
the issue conﬁdently, giving the story 
some weight.
NEW SLANG
But the game is not, like a lot of 
cyberpunk ﬁction, totally nihilistic. 
Its world is bleak, certainly, but the 
narrative focuses on the people trying 
to make it better. The dialogue is a 
little overstuffed with unconvincing 
future slang, but this is a well-realised 
world with nuanced characters and 
twists that will catch you off-guard. It 
helps that it looks and sounds 
beautiful too, with a gorgeously 
moody neo-noir soundtrack, 
expressive pixel art, and an 
atmospheric setting to drink in.

physics to propel yourself up and 
around obstacles. This is a lot harder 
than it sounds, not least because the 
sledgehammer’s head follows your 
mouse cursor at all times. You’re 
never not in control, 
meaning that you’re 
never not an awkward 
ﬂick of your wrist away

Throughout, the 
game’s creator Bennett 
Foddy – who 
previously made 
QWOP and GIRP 
– narrates to you. As you progress up 
the mountain, he explains how 
Getting Over It is an homage to the 
freeware game Sexy Hiking, and goes 
on to talk about the nature of the 
mountain’s difﬁculty, digital culture 
and what it means to create (and play 
through) an uncompromisingly 
difﬁcult game.
DIFFICULTY SLOPE
Foddy takes on the dual role of 
tormentor and comforter. “Hang in 
there. Don’t let it get to you,” he’ll 
urge after a particularly painful fall. 
“But also… let it get to you a little bit.” 
That narration feels key to the 
experience, and gives me a drive to 
push on where, in Foddy’s previous 
games, I’d have long since quit. Foddy 
– at least, the character he plays here 
– rarely sounds like he’s rooting for 
your success. Instead, he seems more 
intrigued by the question of whether 
you’ll persevere or quit. For whatever 
reason, that’s enough to give me an 
incentive to push on. I have not yet 
got over it. But I’m determined. I will 
get over it. Hopefully.

Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy
RE VIE W
The mountain becomes
more abstract as you climb.
You’ll see this area
near the bottom a lot.

After an unexpected run-in with
Concern agents, she decides the thing 
that needs ﬁxin’ most is the world. 
And so she embarks on a quest to 
make it a better place, accompanied 
by a group of rebels who share her 
hatred of One Concern
and the society it has 
created. It’s an 
engaging premise, 
bolstered by colourful 
writing, lavish pixel art,
and superb animation.
Iconoclasts is clearly
inspired by games like 
Metroid and 
Castlevania (if only there was a 
clumsy portmanteau to describe this), 
but it has enough new ideas to stand 
on its own and not feel like a direct 
homage to either. It’s also a lot 
heavier on story than these games 
usually are. It balances pathos and 
humour well, although I found some 
of the jokes a little too goofy.
A grease monkey is nothing 
without her tools, and Robin’s best 
abilities stem from the variety of 
gadgets she has hanging from her 
belt. As well as projectile weapons, 
including a stun gun and a grenade 
launcher, she can batter enemies with 
her wrench and spin it around like a 
gunslinger. She can also jump in the
air and unleash a devastating Super 
Mario-style butt slam.
The wrench has other, more 
interesting uses, too. Around the 
large, interconnected levels you’ll see
glowing bolts, some of 
which can be swung on
to leap over obstacles, 
and others that operate
machinery. The latter 
forms the basis of the 
game’s well-designed 
environmental puzzles,
which involve ﬁnding 
hidden bolts and 
cranking them to slide complex 
networks of doors and platforms 
around, creating a pathway.
Otherwise, Iconoclasts is a fairly 
standard shooter-platformer – but, 
thanks to its responsive controls, an 
enjoyable one. Leaping around feels 
snappy, and there’s a huge bestiary of 
enemies to ﬁght, all with their own 
distinct attack patterns and 
weaknesses. It’s evident a lot of time 
has been spent reﬁning the controls, 
making them feel just right.
The art is impressive, with 
chunky, smoothly animated 
characters reminiscent of SNK’s 
Metal Slug, and some beautifully 
detailed environments. Robin’s 
journey takes her to a lush forest 
ﬁlled with weird geometric plants, a 
sun-baked desert, an underwater city, 
the roof of a speeding train, and other 
locations, all of which beam with 
colour and personality.
It’s a challenging game, too, 
especially when one of the screen-
ﬁlling bosses shows up. While they 
all boil down to memorising a few 
patterns, some of them are incredibly 
fast-paced and chaotic. Often you’re 
accompanied by an AI partner, and 
you’ll need all the help you can get.
TIP OFF
The level of challenge is nicely 
balanced, although a few sharp 
difﬁculty spikes did catch me off 
guard. I also had problems with 
clarity, occasionally unsure where to 
head next to progress, or how to take 
down a particular enemy. Sometimes 
characters will yell out hints during 
boss battles about how to beat them, 
but I found the wording of these 
confusing more than once.
Upgrades called tweaks bring a 
little customisation to the game. 
These can be crafted by ﬁnding 
materials hidden in chests, and offer 
buffs when equipped. And you get to 
choose which of these you equip, 
giving you some freedom to tailor 
Robin to your own speciﬁc playstyle.
Iconoclasts is a ﬁne game, offering 
sharp platforming and shooting, and 
some smart puzzles. It’s enormous, 
too, packed with secret areas and 
other stuff to discover. And although 
I found the humour a little glib and 
childish at times, it tells its heartfelt 
story well. A lot of Metroidvania 
games go for a bleak atmosphere, but 
Iconoclasts is infectiously vibrant, 
even if the story does venture into 
dark territory sometimes.

often to gulp down air. The second 
adventure, The Song of the Whale, 
follows a similar theme. Playing as a 
ﬁsh-loving moggy in a small seaside 
town, you need to come to the 
assistance of a ruddy great whale, 
who for reasons unknown to you is 
currently ﬂoating in the middle of the 
sky. The whale’s sad 
song suggests that the 
creature is yearning for 
something. It’s up to 
you to locate it and 
bring it back.
Helping out these 
two very different 
creatures is a matter of 
pointing and clicking 
your way around, solving a few 
simple puzzles and chatting to a 
bunch of colourful characters along 
the way. Each game resolves in a 
satisfying manner, but you’re only 
partially here for the story: you 
should play this small anthology for 
its beautiful and serene atmosphere.
STORYBOOK
It’s an atmosphere conjured up via 
the impossibly lovely artwork, which 
is at once charmingly naive and 
technologically sophisticated, the 
engine making use of numerous 
background layers, bountiful 
animation, a roving camera and 
occasional lighting effects to create 
the illusion of moving paintings – this 
is a child’s storybook brought 
fastidiously to life.
There are better-drawn and 
better-written games than these two 
slight tall tales, but there are few as 
vivid and frankly adorable as the twin 
adventures in Tales from the Coral 
Cave. The kid-made artwork creates 
an air of authenticity, while Atelier 
Sentô’s ﬁnish adds a veneer that 
makes this a palatable collection to 
pick up and play. It might be a while 
yet before we’re allowed to go 
spelunking into The Coral Cave, but 
ﬁngers crossed there will be more 
games as delightful as Sango to keep

hile you wait for the

demanding PC ports of
the Persona series, you might want
to give Known Unknowns a play. It’s
the latest text adventure from
interactive ﬁction author Brendan
Patrick Hennessy, who you might
remember from Bell Park, Youth
Detective and the brilliant Birdland,
both of which take place in the
same world as Known Unknowns.
Birdland heroine Bridget even
makes a guest appearance in this
new adventure, which is set in and
around a Canadian high school.
Hennessy’s games combine teen
drama and romance with intriguing
supernatural mysteries, and this
episodic series is no different.
Released in four parts over the last
year and a bit, Known Unknowns
concerns the complicated life of
student Nadia Nazari, who has rather
a lot to contend with over the course
of the game. Firstly, she has the
school newspaper to manage, whose
biggest story is the sudden, hilarious
arrival of a ghost raccoon. And then
there’s the reappearance of her
former best friend Summer, who
hasn’t spoken to her in years. Finally,
there’s the fact that she’s been hiding
her bisexuality from her boyfriend.
It’s a lot of plot to juggle, but
Hennessy manages it with aplomb.
Known Unknowns features some
of the most natural dialogue I’ve
encountered in a game – its
conversations feel like genuine
chinwags between chums. The
writing is often funny, even as the
dexterously plotted story keeps you
engaged with its mystery. Whack in a

you’d have a Persona game,

NEED TO KNOW
The game keeps things interesting by 
utilising a variety of visual styles.
T
here are plenty of games
that give you a world to
explore, with mountains to
climb or maybe ruins to traverse,
but what’s the point of trudging
around a digital landscape if there’s
nothing to see and no one to talk to
as you wander about? Storyseeker,
as the name suggests, is a game
about seeking stories, in a diverse
and mysterious world that
encompasses woodland, water,
deserts, mountains and most of the
things that lie in-between.
These stories are told
environmentally by the ruins of the
past, but also by the people who are
still residing there, who are only too
happy to chatter away as your roving
stranger happens by. Through their
dialogue – their sad or funny but
always brief speech – you gradually
construct a fragmented knowledge of
this fantastical alien world.
There’s something new around
every corner, be it a quaint seaside
village, an ominous boneyard, a
broken-down wagon or a monolithic
stone giant, and because there’s no
map to rob the land of its inherent
mystery, it’s a place that feels far
bigger than it probably is. You will get
lost, but keep heading on in any
direction and you’re bound to ﬁnd
something interesting.
There’s no action, no puzzles and
little animation here, a quality that

There are perspective-shifting 
setpieces and ambitious visuals tied 
to your sanity level, and as many little 
details and secrets as you can cram 
into a game hewn from 2006’s largest 
and brownest polygons. Or, at least, 
there are until, 
suddenly, there aren’t: 
Dark Corners’ early 
hours are combat-free 
and concerned with 
atmosphere. What you 
don’t realise is that 
there’s a deeply ’00s 
shooter waiting in Dark
Corners’, er, dark 
corners, and it wants to get out.
You head to Innsmouth on a 
missing persons case and, as in the 
original short story, end up hunted by 
ﬁshmen through the streets at night. 
This goes on for what seems like 
forever – you solve puzzles, attempt a 
bit of wonky stealth, and bash your 
head against Simon Says escape 
sequences – but then, before you

ark Corners of the Earth is, like a lot of subsequent Lovecraft 
mythos stuff, a sort of greatest hits compilation. It’s a 
ﬁrst-person horror adventure made with a lot of love for the 
original material – particularly The Shadow Out of Time, 
The Shadow Over Innsmouth, Dagon, and, err, The Call of 
Cthulhu. It’s a grab bag of more modern horror ideas, too: like the spooky 
little girl from The Ring, and the hordes of terrifying crabs from real life.
know it, you’re being pulled out of a 
ﬂaming truck by J. Edgar Hoover.
I’m not joking: that happens. One 
cutscene after that and you’re leading 
FBI agents against an entrenched 
ﬁshman machine gun position. And 
this is the game that 
Dark Corners remains: 
the antediluvian secret 
lurking beneath 
Innsmouth turns out to 
be a brown industrial 
complex, and the best 
answer to a Great Old 
One is a Big New Gun.
It feels like Dark 
Corners is dragged down by the 
assumptions of its time. It made me 
glad that horror devs now 
understand that you don’t need a 
puzzle where you spin wheels to 
change water levels, just like you 
don’t need a turret sequence. They 
also now understand that acting and 
direction are a thing: Dark Corners’ 
lead remarks on desiccated cadavers 
and ancient monoliths with a sort of 
happy professional indifference, like 
he’s narrating a low-budget National 
Geographic channel documentary 
about ﬁshermen. Sometimes, in the 
game’s darkest moments, he manages 
to sound a bit like he’s narrating a 
low-budget National Geographic 
channel documentary about UFOs.
COMIC HORROR
In the end, my favourite Lovecraftian 
surprise was when I jumped over 
some burning planks, got pinned in 
place in a narrow gap between a wall 
and the ﬂoor, vibrated intensely for a 
few seconds, and then catapulted up 
into the grey space beyond the world. 
Not many people remember that 
Lovecraft invented the geometry 
glitch in The Dreams in the Witch 
House, a story where a witch travels 
through time and space because 
maths is evil. So in this way at least 
Dark Corners manages to turn some 
of its jank into an asset, which is all 
any of us can hope for, really.

n the years before it turned out
the lovely pixel adventure
Sword & Sworcery, Capybara 
made cute puzzle games and did a 
bit of dev-for-hire. These were the 
years when digital sales were 
beginning to open up on console, 
when the big publishers started to 
see the value in chucking money at 
smaller studios to turn around £10 
games for Xbox Live Arcade and 
the PlayStation store.
You wouldn’t expect many of these 
games to stick in the memory: not 
least this, a match-three strategy 
game set in Ubisoft’s terminally bland 
Might & Magic universe – the fantasy 
setting you get if you load up 
Warcraft in Photoshop and turn the 
contrast down. And yet: Clash of 
Heroes is a really well-designed game.
You take turns against an 
opponent to rearrange the units in 
your army as it marches up the 
screen. Form a vertical row of three
units of the same colour and they’ll 
take an attack position, which will 
trigger after a certain number of 
turns. Form a horizontal row and 
they’ll turn into a defensive wall, 
which mitigates attacks. There are 
loads of units, faction speciﬁc traits, 
deck-building and gear-equipping 
systems, and an RPG-style campaign 
with sidequests and so on.
Clash of Heroes was originally 
designed for handheld but that 
basically just means that there aren’t 
too many menus to ﬁddle with and it 
works well on a pad. The story is naff, 
but there’s a bit early on where an elf 
says, “It’s clear there is some danger 
– take these bears in case we run into 
trouble,” and so I can’t really hold 
that against it, either. I reckon the
licence and the Ubisoft 
splash screen are the only 
reasons this isn’t more 
fondly remembered.

remembering that every game that

like a lamentable Trump executive

three, it’s lumbered with the

Intel and AMD trade blows in this CPU brawl 
T
he arrival of Ryzen 
last year gave the 
CPU market the 
kick it had long been 
waiting for. By 
offering multicore performance 
at unprecedented low prices, it 
forced Intel to battle back. As a 
result, we now have one of the 
most competitive CPU markets in 
ages, and there’s never been a 
better time to buy. 
The tricky part, of course, is 
deciding which chip to get, which 
is where this handy guide comes 
in. I’ve tested a handful each of 
AMD and Intel’s main contenders 
to see which is the best option for 
a variety of budgets. Benchmarks 
at the ready…

  MARCH 2018

Dictionary
Core/thread: Modern CPUs 
are made up of several 
processors called cores. 
Each core can run a piece of 
code, or thread, 
independently. 
Simultaneous 
multithreading: The 
generic term for Intel 
Hyperthreading and AMD 
SMT, this is where a CPU 
core is able to handle two 
threads at the same time. 
This makes each core appear 
as though it’s dual-core to 
your software and can give a 
performance boost in 
multithreaded workloads. 
Socket: CPUs are designed 
to be used only with certain 
motherboards. The socket is 
the physical thing the CPU 
plugs into, and the 
components have to match. 
Chipset: The chip that 
controls how the CPU 
interacts with the 
motherboard. The two main 
ones are X370 for AMD and 
Z370 for Intel.
Base clock/boost clock: 
The base clock is the normal 
top speed for all cores while 
the boost clock is the 
maximum potential speed of 
one or more cores.
Q&A
AMD or Intel?
AMD still offers the best 
value, especially as the 
company has suggested its 
imminent second-gen Ryzen 
chips will still work on its 
X370 motherboards and will 
be noticeably faster. Right 
now, though, Intel still has a 
lead in single-threaded 
workloads, which is best for 
gaming, though you pay a 
little more for the privilege.
Cores or clock speed?
Clock speed is still king for 
most games – even a 
dual-core chip is sufficient 
for the majority of games. 
Times are changing, though, 
and devs are getting better 
at utilising multiple cores. 
What about overclocking?
Intel still has a lead in clock 
speed. AMD’s fastest chips 
struggle to pass 4GHz, even 
when overclocked, while 
Intel’s chips can push 5Ghz. 
What about Threadripper/
Core i9? 
Something you won’t find in 
this roundup are any AMD 
Threadripper or Intel Core i9 
processors. These high-end 
processors are beyond what 
we consider necessary for 
any gaming PC, unless you 
intend to run multiple 
top-end graphics cards.

Otherwise it has all the other key features that make
the Ryzen line so tempting. It’s unlocked for easy
overclocking, it auto-overclocks from a base clock
speed of 3.5GHz to 3.7GHz, and it’s very cheap.
Intel does have a similarly priced quad-core chip
but it’s multiplier-locked and lacks turbo boost, so
its clock speed is stuck at 3.6GHz. Not that the
1300X is all that great for overclocking, but like most
Ryzens, it can be pushed to around 3.9GHz-4GHz.
What’s more, the relatively modest core/thread
count of this chip doesn’t hold it back, with it holding
its own in all of our game tests other than the
fiendish Ashes of the Singularity. Here, it’s the only
AMD chip to not deliver around 65fps at 1080p.
It’s worth noting that the performance deficit of
the AMD processors in Ashes of the Singularity is
an anomaly. I’ve still included it, as an indicator that
there are games simply better optimised for Intel’s
Core architecture.
That aside, the 1300X is a great
starting point for a budget gaming PC.

All the usual caveats apply in regards to its relatively
modest clock speed compared to its Intel rivals, but 
Intel can’t offer anything with this multithread 
performance for the same price.  
Plus, we see that the 1500X comes out on top of 
all the AMD chips for several tests, hinting that its 
core count allows AMD’s automatic overclocking to 
squeeze out that last little bit of speed.
Incidentally, the reason I’ve chosen the X 
variants for the AMD chips is that clock speed is the 
biggest thing AMD’s chips struggle with. So even 
though all Ryzens are overclockable, results aren’t 
guaranteed. Opting for the X variants gives you the 
best chance of getting the fastest clock speed. 
In contrast, I’ve gone for the K variants of the 
Intel chips because they’re easy to overclock, and 
though they don’t need the extra speed, they’re so 
easy to boost that you might as well.
Intel doesn’t have a direct equivalent
to the 1500X now and, as such, it
stands out as an ideal option for £155.

 The cheapest of the AMD CPUs in this test, the Ryzen 
3 1300X offers four cores but, unlike the Ryzen 5 
processors, it doesn’t include SMT. As such, it can only 
handle four threads at once.
 The Ryzen 5 1500X is another great value chip. With 
four cores and SMT, it can handle up to eight threads at a 
time, plus it’s multiplier-unlocked and runs at a decent 
clock speed. For £155, that’s seriously good.

Nearly a year on, however, and the story’s different.
Now Intel has a much more direct equivalent in the
shape of the 8600K, which has six cores and can
run at a considerably faster clock speed (although it
still lacks hyperthreading). However, AMD has kept
the fight going through the 1600X’s price.
It’s available for £180, making it an excellent
choice for those seeking a powerful multicore
machine, but who are still on something of a budget.
Combine it with a basic B350 motherboard and you
can have a strong six-core CPU-and-motherboard
combo for under £300, which is, frankly, ludicrous.
There are some caveats to consider, though.
Despite being multiplier-unlocked, there’s not all
that much headroom for overclocking, so around
4GHz is all you’ll likely get. Even without
overclocking, the 8600K maintains a strong lead in
single-thread performance, and so in terms of
gaming power, it’s the better of the two.
That said, 1600X’s value can’t be
ignored, making it a great option.
AMD RYZEN 5 1600X
www.amd.com£180
As well as packing in a huge number of cores, the
1800X also includes SMT technology so it can 
handle 16 threads at a time. Plus, like all Ryzen 
processors, it’s multiplier-unlocked for easy 
overclocking and runs at a decent clock speed, with 
a base clock of 3.6GHz and boost speed of 4GHz.
However, while the 1800X may be the fastest 
Ryzen chip, it’s still some way off comparable chips 
from Intel. Notably, the Core i7-8700K may have a 
base speed of 3.7GHz but it can boost to 4.7GHz. 
What’s more, the 1800X can’t be overclocked 
that well. Our Asus Crosshair VI Hero motherboard 
couldn’t push it far beyond a 4GHz base clock. That 
provides a nice boost to multithreaded workloads, 
but because overclocking disables the automatic 
single-core overclocking, many will find single-
thread performance doesn’t improve or even drops.
While the 1800X is still a fairly decent option for
most gamers, it’s not the best. The
8700K would be the better way to
spend around £330 on a CPU.

 At launch, the 1600X stood out in AMD’s Ryzen line. 
Six cores, SMT, a decent clock speed and multiplier-
unlocked. Back then, Intel’s closest equivalent was a 
quad-core chip that didn’t even have hyperthreading.
 The Ryzen 7 1800X is AMD’s flagship mainstream CPU 
and brings with it more cores than anything Intel can 
offer for the same price. You can get an 1800X and 
motherboard for well under £400.

This was because it had two cores, and while
hyperthreading helped, the advantage from
jumping to quad-core processors was plain to see.
This update to the Core i3 part bumps it up to true
quad-core, making it much more of an all-rounder.
However, it doesn’t come without compromises.
While you gain two physical cores, you lose
hyperthreading, so as far as your apps can tell it has
no more cores than the 7350K. Also, it lacks Turbo
Boost so it can’t bump up the frequency of one of
the cores to eke out even more performance – all
four can run at up to 4GHz and that’s your lot.
It holds its own in multithreaded workloads,
doing well withAshes of the Singularity, which
favours having many cores. It trounces the 7350K,
with the older chip managing 39fps in the 1440p/
Ultra test, compared to 46fps for the 8350K.
You’ll have to stretch your budget further than
for an equivalent AMD chip, but for sheer
gaming performance, the 8350K is a
great option.
INTEL CORE i3-8350K
www.intel.com£155
Now Intel’s back with the 8600K that, like the
8700K, ups the core count by two while retaining 
the high clock speed and overclockability that made 
its predecessor so tempting. 
The one thing you still miss out on is 
hyperthreading, and it’s surprising just how much of 
a difference it makes. While the 8700K does have a 
clock speed advantage, it’s nonetheless notable 
that it’s 50% faster than the 8600K in the 
multithread Cinebench test. 
As ever, the major caveat here is price, with 
AMD’s direct rival, the 1600X, being around £50 
cheaper while still having a lead in multithread 
performance thanks to its inclusion of SMT. 
Take advantage of the 8600K’s overclockability, 
though, and it’s able to close most of that gap, and 
further extend its lead in other areas. 
As such, if your budget can stretch a little 
further, the 8600K may be the better bet, 
particularly if gaming is your highest 
performance priority. 
INTEL CORE i5-8600K
www.intel.com£240
 Intel’s multiplier-unlocked Core i3 processor from last 
generation, the Core i3-7350K, always felt a bit too 
underpowered, despite its impressive clock speed 
making it surprisingly capable in some ways. 
 If the 7700K was always the go-to choice for gamers 
with money to burn, the 7600K was the aspirational next 
best thing. With its four cores, high clock speed and 
overclockability, it was a great all-rounder.

However, as soon as Ryzen came along it instantly
looked like poor value, despite the high clock speed 
meaning it held its own when gaming. 
Intel’s response? The Core i7-8700K. With 50% 
more cores it brings the fight to AMD’s finest in 
multithreaded workloads while its 3.7GHz-4.7GHz 
clock speed means it still has a big advantage. 
What’s more, it overclocks well. With an Maximus X 
Hero I managed to push all six cores to 5GHz. 
This is all reflected in my benchmarks where it 
tops the Cinebench single-thread test and almost 
beats the 1800X in the multithread test. In games, it 
dominates, topping all but one of my tests. 
The only downside is that it’s still pricey 
compared to AMD’s range. Even the eight-core 
1800X is cheaper, and though the 8700K holds its 
own in multithread workloads, it’s not that good. 
However, with a strong lead in clock speed, the 
8700K is still the clear choice for those 
seeking pure gaming performance, 
without too much regard for price. 
INTEL CORE i7-8700K
www.intel.com£355
The i7-7700K was the ideal for gamers who weren’t on a 
budget. Its four hyperthreaded cores, 4.2GHz base 
speed and 4.5Ghz turbo boost offered a perfect balance 
of single and multithreaded performance.

MSI FORCE GC30 GAMING CONTROLLER
www.msi.com£37
This is the first time that I’ve placed a controller in the main spot. That alone should tell you 
just how impressed I am with MSI’s Force GC30. In a world where PC gaming is becoming 
ever more well-stocked with more console-style titles, is now the time to pick up a pad?
I say the answer is yes. After all, for the games that
need them (here’s looking at you Dragon Ball
FighterZ), using a controller over a mouse and
keyboard makes life so more enjoyable. If the high
price of wireless pads has previously put you off, the
MSI GC30 is the pad for you.
It’s a fantastically well-bundled bit of kit, with an
awesome finish, a typical Xbox controller layout,
vibration and, more importantly, wireless (or
wired) connectivity, all for £37. Everything
feels solid, which is a rarity for cheaper
controllers. The materials are good, and although 
not weighty, it’s not light enough to feel tacky.
Not to overstate it, but the value factor here is 
superb. To find such build quality in a wireless 
controller at this price point is ridiculous. This isn’t 
the route I expected MSI to go down, but if this is 
any sign of how its peripherals are going to develop 
going forward, consider me excited.

We’ve seen the price of a 16GB kit of memory increase

I
ntel has had a bad month. A pair of far-reaching
CPU security issues dubbed ‘Spectre’ and
‘Meltdown’ (presumably action movie
producers were in charge of naming them)
have been all over the headlines recently, and
their impact is far-reaching: if you have an Intel CPU
produced in the last 20 years sitting at the heart of your
PC, you’re affected.
The question is: how much? In theory, the Meltdown exploit
allows access to all the bits of your CPU that were long
considered impossible to access, and thus allocated as secure
memory storage. That means any and all sensitive data is fair
game for potential cyber snoopers. Passwords, photos,
documents, off-colour Skyrim mods: the lot. Spectre is a
similar story, but it doesn’t end with Intel PCs. AMD desktops,
smartphones and tablets of all denominations can be pilfered
of their most secure information by the latter exploit. It’s a bit
of a worry.
Security exploits do crop up, of course, and a company as
big as Intel shouldn’t be dragged across the coals simply for
an exploit being discovered across its decades-wide raft of
hardware. It might seem a flimsy platitude, considering the
scale of the problem, but these things happen. Frequently.
That’s why your PC wants to restart itself every five minutes
– the goalposts of cyber security are forever changing, and

both manufacturers and platform holders need to be agile in 
their responses.
FEELING THE HEAT
The difference with Meltdown and Spectre is that they were
brought to the world’s attention long before Intel, Microsoft,
Apple, AMD et al were ready to roll out any fixes. That’s
dangerous. It was discovered by four separate research
teams, all working independently, over the span of just a few
months. They informed Intel, and Intel started work on a fix for 
its two-decades-old security flaw. Yet word about Meltdown
and Spectre got out before it was ready.
After the security flaws were made public, news sites
reported that Intel’s CEO Brian Krzanich had sold off a huge
number of stocks in the company in November 2017 –
months after Intel had been made aware of the problem. An
Intel spokesperson told press that Krzanich’s sale was
“unrelated” to the security issues. And as of writing, Intel’s
stock is trading at roughly the same price Krzanich sold it for, 
meaning there was no significant gain from that timing.
Some good news, though: Meltdown hasn’t been as bad as 
the gloomier industry voices feared, and we’ve yet to see an
attack as a result of these flaws. In fact, despite panicked
reports about just how bad these exploits could be, Intel and 
other affected manufacturers were able to roll out their
updates before Meltdown lived up to its ominous moniker. We

TECH  
REPORT
GHOST IN THE MACHINE
Within that 
architecture, a 
dangerous security 
exploit lurks. Is 
there a 
performance-
friendly fix?

haven’t seen anything on the scale of the 2017 NHS cyber 
attack, for example, in which over 300,000 computers were 
affected. Unfortunately, the updates come with an admittedly
less-cataclysmic side effect. They affect CPU performance. 
CPUs, like pre-election governments, need to demonstrate
strength and stability. Strength, in this field, is measured in 
raw data-crunching ability, and stability from the absence of 
blue screens, system hangs, and alarming pops coming from 
within your case. It’s been a frenetic 20 years for CPU 
performance and until recently the industry kept pace with 
Moore’s Law, which is to say the focus has long been on faster
performance; iterating on architecture so that it’s optimised to
perfection, then doing it all 
over again. Fixing a problem 
that applies to every Intel CPU 
architecture since the 
mid-’90s, then, threatens to 
shake loose a lot of those 
incremental performance 
gains. It requires a 
fundamental change in 
operation, because the exploit works by accessing the OS 
kernel, a secret area of virtual memory kept several layers 
deep in an OS which blocks untrusted programs from 
accessing it. Kernels have been fundamental to Windows OS 
design since Bill Gates had acne, and Intel has made CPUs in 
accordance with that constant for a long time.
INTEL’S INTEL
The bad news? Early reports about the Meltdown fixes 
suggest they can impact performance by as much as 49%. 
The good news? Your gaming PC is probably fine. Large-scale
server arrays and big data virtual machine-type stuff has been
hit hardest, not least because it’s the most vulnerable to 
attack. Snoop on one individual machine and maybe you get a 
Netflix login, some Steam chat records and perhaps a folder 
of holiday snaps. Snoop on a virtual machine that’s connected 
to many others, and suddenly you’ve got access to the type 
and volume of data that lets you hold big companies to 
ransom. That was an example, by the way, not an instruction. 
Please don’t do either, there’s a good reader.  
As the Windows patch has been ignominiously rolled out 
the world over, benchmarkers haven’t noticed much of a 
drop-off in gaming performance on a single machine. 
Synthetic benchmarks, like Cinebench, seem more likely to 
report lower performance, 
but games themselves? Most 
benchmarks show a 1fps 
drop, roughly. That’s 
frustrating, certainly, if you’ve 
fine-tuned your CPU and 
overclocked that extra 1fps 
through hard graft. But 
considering the potential 
ramifications of a security vulnerability this big – it’s called 
bloody Meltdown –  it’s a comparatively small price to pay. So 
if your first instinct upon reading this is to start googling ‘how 
to roll back meltdown fix’... don’t. Seriously. 
The real question is whether major companies, such as 
Google, Microsoft and its Azure cloud service, and Amazon, 
can implement a fix without their whole infrastructure falling 
over. Ultimately, yes, these security breaches are a big deal. 
Yes, they affect PC gaming, but no, not by any meaningful 
measure. Let Windows or Linux do their thing, and enjoy that 
private data of yours.

CONTINUED ADVENTURES IN GAMING
EXTRA LIFE

B
roadly speaking, I
enjoy Blizzard’s games 
– I just tend to forget 
they exist. Hence my 
surprise one evening 
at ﬁnding Diablo III still installed 
on my hard drive. I have vague 
memories of clicking on swarms of 
undead, prompting my Wizard to 
melt them with a big, magic laser. 
I’m pretty sure it was an enjoyable 
time. I head in to investigate.
As I load into a town, I remember 
where I’d left off. I’d completed the 
main campaign, and was building 
towards the endgame and the higher 
Torment difﬁculties. I load onto a 
bounty map and soon encounter a 
powerful enemy. It kills me. Suddenly, 
I remember why I’d quit: I didn’t 
know how to play the game.
Completing the game on normal 
difﬁculty is not a challenge, meaning 
you’re never required to learn 
Diablo III’s more intricate rules and 
systems. I’d blithely charged through 
the game and its expansion, pointing 
my Wizard beam at enemies and 
bosses – zapping everything from the 
lowliest zombie to Diablo itself. They 
all fell, and I learned nothing – except 
that lasers are cool. Even this, it 
seems, is a point of contention. 
Figuring I should work out how to 
play Diablo III, I search for the 
highest-rated Wizard builds. The 
laser skill, Disintegrate, almost never 
features. It seems I need to diversify 
my approach.
LIVE THE BEAM
I try builds involving arcane 
projectiles, electric shocks and 
meteors falling from the sky. I even 
start paying attention to my gear – 
never previously an issue – ﬁguring 
out what stats to prioritise and what 
sets to start collecting. It works well, 
and I have some success on the lower 
Torment difﬁculty levels, but I’m not 
having fun. There’s some pretty cool 
abilities in the Wizard’s arsenal, but 
none of them are a giant death laser.
With respect to the theorycrafters 
and min-maxers, this is a singleplayer 
game. I can Disintegrate if I want to. I 
switch back to the laser, survivability 
be damned. Luckily, it seems my 
foray into effective wizardry has 
armed me with enough knowledge 
about the game’s systems that even a 
non-effective build can thrive. I 
might not be reaching my potential, 
but, with some careful positioning 
and by remembering to use my 
secondary skills and teleports, my 
laser is once again clearing dungeons. 
Hopefully I’ll remember all of these 
lessons when I return to the game in 
another few years. 
From this point on, my team 
becomes a caricature of itself. A 6-4 
win against a mid-table side, a 6-5 
sandwiched between two 2-3 losses. 
We take the last playoff spot by one 
point, then conﬁdently win in the 
semis. It’s a Pyrrhic victory that costs 
me my goalkeeper, forcing me to rely 
on a two-star replacement.

The ﬁnal pits us against 
Middlesbrough, the only team to beat 
us both home and away throughout 
the season. Whatever happens, this 
will be the last time I see this line-up. 
A slow start, then catastrophe: my 
striker falls awkwardly. He’s taken off 
on a stretcher. It’s time for his backup 
to make a reappearance, and, with 
any luck, overturn his misfortune. 
Instead, nothing. 0-0 at half-time. We 
create two chances but the player 
who could ﬁnish them is nowhere to 
be found. It goes to extra time and 
my backup gets injured as well. I 
have no subs left. It’s ten against 11 
for the last 20 minutes, and all that 
awaits us at the end is a penalty 
shootout we aren’t going to win.
Then, with two minutes to go, the 
ball bounces to a winger. He dribbles 
past one defender, then another. A 
venomous, curled shot follows. The 
ball ﬁzzles past Middlesbrough’s 
helpless keeper. That’s it. Everyone 
on the pitch knows that there will be 
no more goals scored this day.
Against all odds, we’ve reached 
the promised land.

ften I think of Viscera 
Cleanup Detail as less 
of a game and more of
a personality test. The
debacle revolves 
around you and a group of friends 
acting as FPS janitors, cleaning up 
after the monster-shooting is over. 
There are bullet casings to collect, 
thoraxes to incinerate and USB 
sticks to gather from fallen allies.
It’s a cleaning sim. It has the appeal 
of bringing order to a disordered 
world through the act of mopping. I 
sometimes wonder whether the 
developer, RuneStorm, would ever 
make the accompanying FPS so that 
players could generate unique 
hellscapes and then the cleanup 
detail could tidy those.
But that’s beside the point. The 
point right now is that, in playing 
scenarios with friends, you learn a lot 
about those friends. 
I am one of nature’s tidiers. I 
didn’t used to be but suddenly a 
switch ﬂipped and I can now happily
spend an hour folding laundry into 
cuboids. In Viscera, I am the boring 
one. While everyone else is larking 
about, playing games of catch with an
errant mandible, I will be scrubbing 
bloodstains from walls. I listen to the 
banter but don’t chip in for fear of 
reminding people I’m not skiving off.
My friend Dan can be similarly 
tidy. When left to ourselves we obsess 
over tiny blips on the mess detection 
device, wrangling the whole area into 
terrifying spotlessness. He’s more 
prone to joining in the fun, though. 
He’ll abandon his grim bucket of slop 
and take a break for the right japes. 
CLEAN TEAM
My partner is a stop further along the 
scale. He’ll get around to tidying 
eventually, but will also gleefully 
break the only lift on the level and 
chuck barrels beyond the scenario’s 
boundary just to see what happens. 
“That’s usually a sign that the  
level is on ﬁre”
When he turns up, Dan will abandon 
me in a ﬁt of giggles. Then something 
will explode and there will be a guilty 
silence from the pair of them. 
Alice marries inexplicable 
efﬁciency with the ability to seem 
like she’s just titting about. Her 
banter game never drops below a ten 
so I assume her area is a tip, then I’ll 
turn up and wherever she’s been will 
be immaculate. I feel like Viscera 
might be her natural esport. 
Then there’s Nat. Nat will always 
ﬁnd the laser welder. The laser 
welder is supposed to be for removing 
bullet holes from walls and ﬁxing 
lightning scars. It can also overheat 
and start shooting ﬁreballs into the 
level, burning everything and leaving 
a sooty mess. When Nat has been 
quiet for more than a minute that’s 
usually a sign that the level is on ﬁre. 
The thing here is that I don’t like 
playing Viscera alone. I need my 
friends to ﬂesh out the experience. 
Nat means I have soot to clean up. 
Dan is a vital ally when I say, “We 
should get on with this...”, and Alice 
and my partner add a clownish radio 
drama (“Oops, was that your body 
bag?”) and concerning vagueness 
(“Oh that’s what that does!”). 
Together we are a glorious, inefﬁcient 
cleaning machine.

here’s an old saying
that we’re at our best
when we’re in love.
But unless you’re very
self-assured in a
relationship, you can easily feel
possessive and emotionally needy,
constantly checking your phone to
see if the other person has
messaged you and feeling hurt
whenever they spend time with
someone else. Going through a
breakup can be even worse. There’s
nothing as frightening as an ex who
can’t let go.
Horror game Simulacra perfectly
captures the feeling of a breakup, and
the fear of trying to meet someone
new. Kaigan Games designed
Simulacra to look like the interface on
a smartphone, which you discover
belonged to a woman called Anna.
Anna is in the throes of a messy
breakup with Greg, who she caught
cheating on her after looking at his
texts. Anna has gone missing, and it’s
up to you to piece together the clues
on her phone and work out what
could have happened to her.
Greg is the ex who just can’t move
on. His messages to Anna go from
cool and superior (it was really her
fault for looking at his texts in the
ﬁrst place) to outraged (how dare she
treat him this way). He is a man who
manipulates every interaction to cast
himself as the victim.
Before she went missing, Anna
also joined a dating app called Spark,
a play on Tinder where you swipe
left or right on potential matches. If
you’ve ever tried a dating site, or been
a woman on social media, you’ll
empathise with the messages that
ﬂood Anna’s inbox. The cheesy jokes
and failed attempts at ﬂirting are bad
enough, but the sexual aggression
(one man talks openly about wanting
to eat her out) is chilling, and casts a
shadow over Anna’s hope of meeting
someone who will treat her well.
This distrust of men slips into real
life, too, when you ﬁnd out that a
colleague of Anna’s has been sending
her inappropriate messages about the
way she dresses. When Anna calls
him out on it, his response reveals a
disconnect with the way a woman
would feel. “You’re making a big deal
out of this. I can’t even tell you you’re
pretty?” Nothing could feel more
relevant in the time of #MeToo.
A GLASS DARKLY
Just playing the game makes you feel
like a creepy ex. Poring over each
message and lingering over her
photos plays into the internet’s most
voyeuristic urges: social media allows
us peeks into who someone is, but to
see what they keep private cracks
open another layer. It initially feels
good, and then just feels sickening.
At its most basic, Simulacra is a
horror game about a missing girl, but
it says so much about being a woman
on the internet, especially at a time
when stories of abuse are being
shared. Are people who we think
they are? And how do we move on
from a relationship when the other
person is always watching?

E X TR A  LIFE

I
t’s been almost ﬁve 
years since Euro 
Truck Simulator 2 was
ﬁrst released for PC, 
and SCS Software is 
still growing its vast recreation of 
Europe. Recent expansions include 
Going East (Eastern Europe), Vive 
la France (France, obviously), and 
Scandinavia, which adds Sweden, 
Norway, and Denmark to an 
already substantial, complex map. 
And now, thanks to the recent Italia 
expansion, you can drive the entire 
length of the boot, from Milan in 
the north to Palermo in the south.
The variety of scenery on offer makes 
Euro Truck Simulator 2 one of the 
ﬁnest road trips on PC. The steep, 
twisting mountain roads of Norway 
feel notably different to the rolling 
farmland of France or the grey, 
drizzly motorways of the UK. But 
you will have to spend a few quid to 
enjoy the full experience. The big 
expansions cost about £14 each, 
which is a signiﬁcant amount. Still, if 
you love the game, the chance to have 
a new country (or several) to drive 
through will be hard to resist.
The Italia expansion boasts some 
of the prettiest scenery in the game. 
There are elevated roads overlooking 
stretches of rugged countryside, 
marinas lined with yachts glinting in 
the sun, and old historical towns 
perched atop hills. You really feel like 
you’re driving through Italy, and for
your £14 you get 19 new cities, 
11,500 km of roads, and hand-crafted 
landmarks, architecture, vegetation 
and road signs that feel suitably 
Italian. It’s a pretty hefty package.
It’s worth noting that these 
expansions, as good as they are, don’t 
alter the way the game plays. The 
experience remains largely the same; 
it’s just the scenery that changes. As 
someone who’s still playing the game 
after 100 hours, having new stuff to 
look at is enough motivation for me 
to invest. But if you’ve had your ﬁll of 
the base game and you’re looking for 
new ways to play, you may be 
disappointed. It’s in the mod scene 
where you’ll ﬁnd that sort of thing, 
not the DLC.
TruckersMP, for instance, adds 
multiplayer to the game, letting you 
form a convoy with friends and 
strangers. Trafﬁc Jam makes the 
experience of driving through cities, 
built-up areas and along motorways 
frustratingly realistic, jamming them 
up with AI cars. And there are a 
number of mods to change the 
driving physics to make them, in 
their creators’ eyes, more realistic. So 
even if you don’t want to spend a 
penny on DLC, there are countless 
player-made mods to expand the 
vanilla Euro Truck experience. 
HEAVY DUTY
There are a few smaller, cheaper 
ofﬁcial expansions (about £4 each) 
that mix things up. Special Transport 
adds a variety of unwieldy cargo 
types that are a challenge to get from 
A to B. This includes huge boats and 
wide crates that are inches from 
scraping the paint of cars in the next 
lane. And the High Power pack adds 
high-value loads, like helicopters and 
diggers. The increased reward for 
delivering these things intact makes 
the struggle worth it.
There’s a lot of decorative DLC 
too, including a huge number of paint 
jobs for your trucks. If you’ve ever 
wanted to cover your vehicle in 
tartan or dinosaurs, you can for £2. 
You don’t need any of this stuff and 
it’s all cosmetic so I don’t mind that 
SCS is charging money for it. If it 
means the team has the resources to 
make more expansions, I’m all for it. 
Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a 
brilliant game, even if you don’t give a 
damn about trucks or simulators. It 
can be as accessible or as hardcore as 
you like, thanks to deep 
customisation, and you might be 
surprised by how much you enjoy 
delivering things from city to city. 
There’s something weirdly hypnotic 
and relaxing about cruising down 
those long roads, even if you 
occasionally question why you’re 
spending your free time doing what 
is essentially a job. If you still don’t 
believe me, try the demo available on 
Steam and see for yourself why this is 
one of our favourite PC games.

T
hough generally not a 
favourite of the classic 
Command & Conquer 
series, Tiberian Sun 
strikes a chord with 
fans who ﬁnd Red Alert too 
basic-looking and Red Alert 2 too 
silly. Eight years after its 1999 
release, one such fan began making 
a mod that pushed it into bold new 
territory. Created by Andrew ‘Aro’ 
Owen, and now supported by a 
larger team, Twisted Insurrection is 
a great example of what a talented 
group of fans can do for the legacy 
of a brilliant base game.
As well as skirmish and multiplayer 
modes, the mod offers a variety of 
new campaigns. Each one is set in a 
universe in which NOD won the ﬁrst 
Tiberium War by capturing GDI’s Ion 
Cannon and having a huge barbecue 
on the lawn of the White House.
The mod itself is standalone so 
there’s no barrier to entry, and 
anyone even vaguely familiar with 
C&C can just download it and throw 
themselves into its world of intrigue. 
Crucially, though, this mod is over 
ten years old and there are still 
missions being developed. The sheer 
scale, attention to detail and lack of 
bugs is astonishing. Almost 
everything is either new or improved 
– with the exception of some of the 
basic infantry and a couple of the 
factories, which I suspect have been 
retained because Westwood did a 
good enough job with them.
Twisted Insurrection also adds a 
third, new faction: Globotech. It’s a 
troublesome megacorporation which 
boasts an impressive arsenal of 
mechs, drones and other high-tech 
equipment, all backed up by the usual 
‘sir, yes sir’, infantry and imposing-
looking structures.

The buildings this mod adds are 
so much better than those in Tiberian 
Sun – from the way they animate 
when constructed, to how they look 
when they interact with units and, 
most importantly, how they crumble 
and explode. Something as simple as 
the way your base’s main gate 
collapses in on itself when it lets a 
harvester pass is a joy to watch. 
Although visually superior, the new 
structures are designed very much in 
the spirit of Tiberian Sun, and they 
look in keeping with the few original 
buildings that remain. But the dozens 
of new details, such as road markings, 
signage, crates and barricades, 
collectively play a huge part in 
making this feel like a richer and 
well-loved vision of Tiberian Sun.
WORLDS APART
The world itself is much more 
urbanised and varied. There are new 
types of rare purple and red Tiberium 
to harvest and a host of strange 
mutations that ﬁercely guard it. One 
minute you’ll be having a Starship 
Troopers-style ﬁreﬁght with swarms 
of giant mantises, the next there’ll be 
huge centipedes and ginormous 
ﬂoating woodlice closing in. The 
maps are beautifully designed 
throughout the campaigns, and 
crafted perfectly to guide you
helpfully through the story. GDI
Mission 9, ‘Flight’, stands out as one
of the best, and apart from being the
biggest C&C map I have ever played,
it throws punches at you until the
bitter end. It’s a rollercoaster that
escalates from a small task force
hunting for an abandoned GDI air
base to an all-out battle.
Noticeably, Twisted Insurrection’s
units have a personality that set this
in stone as an outstanding mod.
Almost all of them have their own
voice prompts, which is a treat no
doubt inspired by Red Alert 2. A more
predominant two-tier veteran system
is also borrowed from RA2, and adds
another level of strategy when
managing which units to prioritise.
When blasted by shells, infantry
leave blood trails, explosions are
bigger, and vehicles are weighty. The
NOD Flame Tank is a brilliant
example of how Westwood made a
vehicle worse in Tiberian Sun. More
akin to how it looked in C&C, Twisted
UNIT READY  Four of Twisted Insurrection’s best vehicles and infantry
Insurrection’s Flame Tank spurts out 
huge ﬁreballs that look like napalm, 
where Tiberian Sun’s just looked like 
an endless string of burning sausages.
Twisted Insurrection also has its 
own soundtrack which includes 
plenty of inspiration from other 
games in the series, really making this 
mod a celebration of all things 
Command & Conquer. For the most 
hardcore of fans, there’s even a track 
called ‘Space Echo’ that was remixed 
by Frank Klepacki – Westwood’s 
music composer and the voice actor 
of the original Commando unit.
In addition to its own campaigns, 
newer versions of Twisted 
Insurrection also include redesigned 
versions of the original C&C missions 
in Tiberian Sun’s engine. You can 
hunt down Nikoomba with dune 
buggies as NOD, or recapture the 
beachhead for General Shepherd as 
GDI. These missions are still in 
progress, but they’re a nostalgic 
low-tech accompaniment to the mod, 
executed excellently. 
CLE AVER DRONE
Straight from an episode 
of Robot Wars, these 
floating circular saws skim 
across water at high 
speed, slicing through 
infantry, tanks and 
structures. They’re 
fiendishly fast and best 
used in large numbers.
SIEGE INFANTRY
The long range of their 
mortar shells make these 
troops a crucial part of any 
GDI attack, and if 
supported by snipers, 
grenade troops and 
medics they mean infantry 
can act almost completely 
self-sufficiently.
TREMOR ARTILLERY
Subterranean artillery 
units that can burrow their 
way all the way up to an 
enemy’s perimeter without 
being seen to deliver a 
decisive barrage. They are 
most effective when 
supported by a 
close-range escort.
SCAT TERPACK 
WALK ER
These little mechs make 
mincemeat out of infantry 
with their cannons, and 
they will protect your tanks 
from aircraft when used as 
part of a convoy. They 
vastly outclasses Tiberian 
Sun’s Wolverine unit.

ACTION
REPORT

ACT 1
Phil: After our last GTA Online outing
(see PCG 310), I ﬁgured I was ﬁnally 
done with the game. With Rockstar 
seemingly not interested in making 
any new heists, I didn’t see any 
reason to stick around. And then, 
without warning, Rockstar released a
new string of heists. Just when I 
thought I was out…
Samuel: It’s a nice surprise, and the 
fact this one has a bunch of new 
cutscenes and vehicles suggests it’s a 
big deal for Rockstar. To get it started,
we need a facility, which I purchase 
near Fort Zancudo. I spend a little 
extra money to make it red, because 
we have a brand to maintain, I guess. 
I accidentally activate a cutscene 
with no one else here, which explains
this heist is something to do with a 
slightly Elon Musk-y ﬁgure, an AI 
named Clifford, Lester from the main
game and the US government. 
Doomsday is coming! I think. Maybe 
Russia is involved? That’s what I’ve 
ascertained, anyway. Since only I 
watched this bit, the rest of the team 
will never know what’s going on in 
this heist’s story.
Tom H: Don’t worry Sam, I’m sure 
we’ll be treated to plenty of long 
monologues while driving.
Phil: Sam invites us to join his 
motorcycle club, which is called 
“Motorcycle Club”. It used to be 
called Biker Grove – one for all you 
fans of ’90s teen soap operas – but it 
seems to be bugged. After joining 
Motorcycle Club, we’re invited into 
Sam’s facility and told we need to 
steal a bunch of special vehicles for 
reasons. This preparation phase 
requires us to complete a series of 
missions on an open world public 
server. Luckily, we ﬁnd one that’s 
pretty much empty, and the whole 
thing is incredibly easy.
Tom H: That’s the thing about GTA’s 
open world missions. They’re either 
incredibly easy or you immediately 
get murdered by some prick in a 
ﬁghter jet.
Phil: In fairness, thanks to this 
update you can now also get 
murdered by a prick with an orbital 
cannon. Which is progress of a sort. 
With the relevant cars stolen, we can 
now move onto the instanced setup 
missions. We separate into two 
teams: one inﬁltration, one support. 
Samuel and Tom Senior break into a 
morgue, while myself and Tom 
Hatﬁeld hang back in the helicopter 
that we recently stole, murdering 
people. This is the familiar co-op 
content that I crave.
Tom H: Splitting the party is one of 
GTA Online’s best tricks. I don’t know 
what it looks like inside the morgue, 
I’ve never seen it. Instead I 
experience it entirely through Sam 
and Tom’s barked orders and 
exclamations over Skype.
Samuel: There’s some kind of weird 
glitch where the objective won’t 
activate in the morgue, so we have to 
do it again. It’s a fun mission, though, 
the grisly searching of dead bodies 
aside. Once we’ve got the data we’re 
looking for, we have to make our way 
out and escape in the helicopter. 
Tom S: I get horribly lost in the 
building and spend most of it running 
up and down stairwells under small 
arms ﬁre. I ﬁnally make it to the exit 
and I manage to get stuck on the 
door as Sam dashes for the chopper. 
The team spends a few moments 
shouting from the safety of the 
helicopter as I dash across a 
courtyard full of police and hurl 
myself into the vehicle. Good mission.
Phil: Next, we’re given a stealth 
helicopter and told to go and 
inﬁltrate a server farm. This goes 
badly, of course. On our ﬁrst attempt, 
the helicopter’s landing wheels 
disappear – I’m not sure if this is a 
glitch, or if Sam just accidentally hit a 
button to retract them. Unable to 
land, the helicopter just sort of 
explodes out of boredom. Also, at one 
key point, Hatﬁeld’s internet 
connection drops, which boots him 
from the instance and instantly ends 
the mission for everyone. And even 
when all of those things go right,

we’re forced to scale a ladder, which 
for some reason is the hardest thing 
to do in GTA Online.
Tom S: The trick is to woo the ladder 
with a gentle approach. Not too fast, 
so as not to startle it. We’ve 
experienced enough ladder drama to 
have learned the hard way.
Tom H: This is basically identical to 
the last stealth mission we did in 
GTA. Initially very cool and fun, then 
incredibly frustrating as instant fails 
force multiple restarts.
Phil: Okay, that mission turned out to 
be a disappointment. But this next 
one has a thumbnail image showing 
ﬂying DeLoreans. I am unreasonably 
excited about this. We each get into a 
car and drive to the coast, where 
we’re instructed to activate hover 
mode. Suddenly, we’re skimming 
across the ocean, using missiles to 
blow up boats. It’s great, but I was 
promised full ﬂight, damnit.
Tom H: Then our next assignment 
comes in. In the most long-winded 
and obnoxious way possible, Lester 
tells us he needs us to go to the 
airport. To chase a plane.
Phil: Oh snap, it’s actually happening!
This is it! We get to the airport just as
a plane is taking off, and, as we chase 
after it, a button prompt appears to 
trigger ﬂight mode. And now we’re 
ﬂying. In a car.
Tom H: At one point I accidentally 
press the wrong button and turn off 
ﬂying mode instead of ﬁring missiles, 
causing my car to plummet 
uncontrollable downwards before it 
turns back on. Quickly I realise I can 
use this as a deliberate tactic, and 
toggle ﬂight mode off and on to ﬂip

attacking helicopters. This is without 
a doubt the most fun I’ve ever had in 
GTA Online.
Phil: That was brilliant. And so it’s a 
shame to discover that this act’s 
ﬁnale, rather than bringing all of the 
previous mission’s toys together, is 
just a shootout in a bunker.
Tom H: I’m not entirely sure why 
we’re breaking into an underground 
base in order to defend it. I’m also 
not sure why we’ve done anything 
we’ve done – only that it has 
something to do with Elon Musk. 
The turret part is quite fun, though.

various toys Rockstar has added to
GTA Online, which makes sense.
Happily, the second act’s prep

and a big truck loaded up with a

Tom H: The mission where we 
acquire the water cannon is terriﬁc. 
We head to the beach and proceed to 
start an unarmed brawl with the 
pedestrians, prompting security to 
come in and hose us down. Then we 
shoot them and steal their truck.
Phil: We have high hopes for the 
setup mission, but it’s actually pretty 
boring. We pile into the truck, drive 
to a place, put out some ﬁres and 
steal some data – all while shooting a 
seemingly endless procession of 
crime boys. And then we do it all 
again about four more times. This 
feels like a waste.

that’ll be fun right?

approach the VTOL mammoth. I am 
very excited. Then the lights go out, 
and we’re ambushed. And then we 
die. Oh good, another of Rockstar’s 
infamous online heist difﬁculty

and then have to restart the entire

Tom S: There’s very little cover on 
the hangar ﬂoor, so we end up 
trial-and-erroring our way through, 
learning where the soldiers spawn 
and headshotting them to clear the 
room. It’s essentially a deadly quest

everywhere forever. I squirt them
with a water cannon instead and
send them ﬂying off down the street.
Phil: Hopefully the submarine car
will be better. Divided into two
teams, we drive our submersibles to a
beach and charge towards the water.
Tom H: I accelerate to top speed and
ramp my car off the dock,
transforming it into sub mode just as
I hit the water. It looks awesome.
Samuel: Blasting the mines with the
submarine car was fun, but it seems
like the game never really makes the
most of them – blowing up a
submarine, or ﬁghting off some kind
of enemy underwater is the thing
missing from this mission really.

Worryingly, though, our connection

Samuel: I make the bold suggestion 
that GTA has one more chance – that 
one more dropped connection in the

away from the entire heist, despite 
getting this far.
Tom S: Two quotes from classic heist

you are not willing to walk out on in 
30 seconds ﬂat.” Two: “Don’t waste

W
hen I ﬁrst 
encountered Soul 
Reaver I was blown 
away. If I’m honest,  
this was mainly 
because it let you kill your 
opponents in lots of nasty ways. 
Squaring off against primarily 
vampiric enemies, protagonist 
Raziel needs not only to best his 
opponents in combat, but execute 
them afterwards. This he can do by 
burning them with a torch, 
throwing them into water or a shaft 
of sunlight, or my favourite, 
impaling them with a big stick.
Soul Reaver was everything a 
12-year-old boy could want, and I 
must have played the demo dozens of 
times. But I didn’t get my hands on 
the full game until much later, as for 
some reason my parents thought a 
game about impaling people wasn’t 
suitable for a child. When I ﬁnally 
did play the full version, I was blown 
away again, but for different reasons. 
Soul Reaver was a triumph of visual, 
environmental and narrative design, 
both a technical pioneer and an 
artistic accomplishment that was 
years ahead of its time. Indeed, its 
design ideas still resonate today, 
though perhaps not in the way you 
might have anticipated back in 1999.
Soul Reaver is such a singular 
achievement that it’s easy to forget 
it’s a sequel. The game continues the 
story of Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain. 
A 2D, top-down adventure developed 
by Silicon Knights, Blood Omen sees 
newly ﬂedged vampire Kain wreak 
bloody vengeance upon the world 
that forsook him, and concludes with 
him ruling as self-proclaimed king of 
the dying land of Nosgoth.
WRAITH LIFE
Taking place 1,500 years later, Soul 
Reaver introduces a new protagonist. 
Raziel is the eldest ‘son’ of Kain (ie, 
the ﬁrst vampire that Kain sired), 
who is betrayed by his father after he 
threatens Kain’s supremacy, 
apparently by growing a set of wings. 
For a powerful, immortal vampire, 
Kain sure is petty.
Left to rot for centuries, Raziel is 
eventually reanimated as a wraith by 
a mysterious entity. Now subsisting 
on souls rather than blood, Raziel 
embarks upon a vendetta, seeking out 
his four brothers who assisted Kain

in betraying him, before tracking 
down the undead king himself.
It’s a dark and elegiac tale of 
corruption and cyclical violence. It’s 
also one that is exceptionally told. 
Soul Reaver is one of the earliest 
games to display a cinematic ﬂair – 
not surprising given it was directed 
by Amy Hennig, who would go on to 
produce the Uncharted series. 
Inspired in part by John Milton’s 
Paradise Lost, the script is infused 
with an ornate style that aims to 
mimic its grand, oratory tone. The 
world is described as being “wrecked 
with cataclysms” and “collapsing into 
the dust of its former magniﬁcence”. 
Meanwhile, the basic enemies you 
encounter are “foul, scuttling beasts”, 
while even doors cannot be opened 
without “a sigh of sepulchral air”.
In truth, Soul Reaver’s voice errs 
closer to Lovecraft than Milton, and 
it might come across as absurd were 
it not so well reﬂected in the world’s 
design. Once a grand world, Nosgoth 
has decayed into a wasteland. The 
jagged ruins of landmarks like the 
Silent Cathedral and the Drowned 
Abbey loom out of the fog that 
conveniently reduces your line of 
sight to a few yards.
The matching of Soul Reaver’s 
technical limitations with the 
environmental art means that the 
game remains able to depict a certain 
destroyed grandeur. Locations, such 
as the abyssal whirlpool and the 
towering walls of the human citadel, 
still feel like threatening places. I say 
‘limitations’; at the time Soul Reaver 
was a technical marvel. Not only did 
it depict an open, 3D environment, it 
did so without a loading screen.
Soul Reaver was one of the earliest 
games to take full advantage of level 
streaming, dividing its world into 
blocks which would add and remove 
themselves from memory as the 
player moved around. Clever 
placement of doors that trigger brief 
cutscenes help the game transition 
between larger areas, but the effect is 
nonetheless one of a seamless world.
Today, of course, level streaming is 
nothing special. But there are other 
tricks and effects that Soul Reaver 
employs which remain impressive. 
For example, Soul Reaver uses warp 
portals that allow you to transition to

otherwise-disconnected areas of the 
world. The underlying effect is 
similar to that employed by Portal, 
albeit the implementation here is 
more basic. Soul Reaver’s portals are 
ﬁxed in place, and your only 
interaction with them is choosing 
which other portal they’ll connect to.
SPIRIT REALM
By far Soul Reaver’s most spectacular 
trick, however, is its realm transitions. 
The game takes place in two 
overlapping realms, the spectral and 
the physical. These twin planes of 
existence differ slightly in their 
geometrical layout, with the spectral 
realm being less logically coherent 
than the physical. Hence, when 
Raziel shifts between the two, the 
geometry of the world around you 
warps as well, like clay being subtly 
remoulded by unseen hands.
It’s a wonderful effect, but it’s far 
more than a visual gimmick. 
Phase-shifting is the basis for many 
of the game’s environmental puzzles. 
Fissures in physical walls become 
cavernous passages in the spectral 
realm, while spectral pipes and 
beams will twist and contort 
themselves into pathways impossible 
in physical space. Perhaps my
favourite example involves a boat
anchored in a water-ﬁlled ravine.
Jump onto the deck and shift into the
spectral realm, and the stern of the
ship will skew to one side while the
cliff above extends out to meet it,
creating a tidy pathway.
This is just one of many ways that
Soul Reaver employs spatial puzzling.

scale, the world itself is a gigantic

walls or swim without dissolving.

instances. Moreover, the boss battles 
are now underwhelming. The battle 
against your aquatic brother Rahab is 
particularly unpleasant to play, as it 
requires you to leap between narrow 
platforms using the game’s slippery 
keyboard controls.
It’s worth noting that Soul Reaver 
is nothing like as painful to play as 
the old Tomb Raider games, with 
generous jumps and only a moderate 
amount of precarious platforming. 
But it has its moments. A more 
pressing concern for modern visitors 
is the game’s technical stability. I had 
to invest in the GOG version because 
my Steam copy does not work. At all. 
Nosgoth extends far beyond the 
path that Raziel must tread to exact 
his vengeance. The world is littered 
with secrets and secondary areas that 
offer substantial rewards for the 
determined explorer. These range 
from health boosts to AOE attacks. 
Some of these optional areas are 
ludicrously huge. The road to the 
Stone Glyph, for example, sees you 
enter the area through the eye socket
of a giant skull, before ascending the 
ramparts of a mountain fortress. 
REAVER SOULS
Soul Reaver represents a curious 
chronological knot in the evolution of
the 3D action adventure. Nowadays 
Crystal Dynamics is best known for 
having rebooted the Tomb Raider 
franchise twice in ten years. At the 
time, however, Soul Reaver was 
regarded as Tomb Raider’s main rival,
although both series were published 
by Eidos. Meanwhile, as I previously 
mentioned, Soul Reaver was directed 
by Amy Hennig, whose Uncharted 
series for PlayStation became the 
main source of inspiration for the 
latest Tomb Raider revival.
Yet while the creators of Soul 
Reaver went on to deﬁne the twin 
pillars of action-adventure games for 
the next 20 years, the Legacy of Kain 
was left behind. The last game, 
Deﬁance, stumbled into the sunlight 
in 2003, and all subsequent attempts 
to revive the series have failed. Since 
then the genre has evolved along a 
very different route to the one 
BY FAR SOUL REAVER’S MOST 
SPECTACULAR TRICK IS ITS 
REALM TRANSITIONS
envisaged by Soul Reaver, prioritising
tightly scripted and explosive action
over brain-scratching puzzles and a
world ﬁlled with secrets.
Fascinatingly, however, Soul
Reaver’s notion of a dark, difﬁcult
semi-open world adventure would
anticipate a very different gaming
revolution. I know its extremely
passé to invoke Dark Souls nowadays,
but it’s truly weird how closely Soul
Reaver resembles FromSoftware’s
vision, from its decaying fantasy
realm concealing a mythic, ages-old
conspiracy, to its highly similar
system for dealing with death, and its
seamless, intricately constructed
environment. Both games are even
fundamentally about consuming
souls to become more powerful.
The similarities are such that,
played today, Soul Reaver feels less
like an old Tomb Raider rival and
more like a missing link to Dark
Souls, a discarded idea which has
since been resurrected into a newer,
and far meaner form. Soul Reaver
was one of the last great games of the
20th century, and although the
Legacy of Kain has been all but
forgotten now, its spirit lives on in
other bodies.
Combat is basic by today’s standards, but
it still has enough to keep you interested.

the asylum into a 
twisted playground.
A
rkham Asylum 
regularly features in 
Batman stories, 
usually because The 
Joker or some other 
supervillain has escaped from it. 
Here, though, the asylum is the star, 
ﬂeshed out as a setting like it never 
has been before. Later Arkham 
games took Batman to Gotham City, 
dramatically increasing their size 
and scope in the process. But 
there’s something compelling about 
how Asylum focuses on one 
hyperdetailed setting, giving it a 
rich sense of history and of place 
through some of the ﬁnest 
worldbuilding you can ﬁnd on PC.
Where I grew up there was a stretch 
of woodland behind my house. Far in 
the distance, poking out of the trees, I 
could see two immense black spires. 
These belonged to a psychiatric 
hospital built in the 1800s, around 
which rumours of escape and murder 
would swirl. All playground 
nonsense, of course, but enough to 
make an imprint on my imagination. 
It’s this outdated idea of what an 
asylum represents that fuels Arkham 
Asylum. A terrifying, Gothic place 
where the screams of patients echo 
along tiled hallways and voices 
mutter from padded cells.
Matters of taste aside, it makes for 
an effectively grim, atmospheric 
setting – especially for someone who 
grew up near one of these buildings 
and saw the spires through his 
bedroom window every night. It’s 
when Batman arrives in an area 
called Arkham East that the scale of 
the setting becomes clear. This large, 
open hub area is among the most 
impressive-looking parts of the game, 
illuminated by an oversized, glowing 
moon and dominated by the spires of 
the Arkham mansion – a grand old 
house the asylum was built around.
BIG CITY
On the horizon you can see the 
skyline of Gotham, giving you a sense 
of just how isolated Arkham Island is 
from the rest of the city. You have 
some freedom here to grapple and 
glide around, and while it’s miniscule 
compared to Arkham City, it was the 
one place, before the sequels, where 
you’d feel the most like Batman. For 
the most part, this is a game that 
takes place indoors. But the 
imaginative, exaggerated architecture
of the interiors means it never feels 
claustrophobic or repetitive. You even
get to visit a Batcave, which the 
forward-thinking Batman built under
the asylum in case there was ever a 
catastrophic breakout.
Other locations include the 
Botanical Gardens, a vast glasshouse 
ﬁlled with greenery that becomes the 
unofﬁcial headquarters of Poison Ivy.

Rocksteady had the beneﬁt of 
decades of Batman mythology to 
utilise, and it’s an incredibly well-
realised place.
BAD JOKE
Another thing I love about the setting 
is how it isn’t static. Over time you 
see the place being vandalised. 
Statues of the warden are defaced. 
Signs are hung up welcoming Batman 
to ‘Joker Asylum’. And after 
encountering Poison Ivy, her plants 
burst out of the ground and wrap 
around the buildings. This gives the 
sensation of time passing, and creates 
the illusion that stuff is still 
happening on the island even when 
Batman isn’t there.
I don’t know if Arkham Asylum is 
the best game in the series – the 
reﬁned controls and increased scale 
of City and Knight are hard to ignore 
– but there’s something to be said for 
the more focused structure of 
Rocksteady’s ﬁrst attempt at bringing 
the Batman universe to life. Perhaps 
its greatest achievement is taking 
something as familiar and well-
trodden as Batman and making it feel 
brand new. I’d like to see more 
developers take this approach to 
existing mythologies; picking one 
location and laser-focusing on it, 
using it as way to see that particular 
world through a different lens.
IT’S A SINGLE LOCATION,  
BUT AN IMPRESSIVELY  
VARIED ONE
ZSAS Z
This killer keeps a 
tally of his victims 
carved into his 
flesh. One of the 
first villains Batman 
faces in the game.
THE RIDDLER
You never see him, 
but thanks to the 
riddles scattered 
around the island, 
his presence is 
always felt.

This quirky action adventure asks
you to be a dog who is also a god. You
pad across the beautiful world of
Nippon, using your Celestial Brush to
solve problems and drive back
demons (the god bit). You also bark
at NPCs, try to eat your irritating bug
companion and nap during long
cutscenes (the dog bit).

ASSASSIN’SCREEDORIGINS
www.bit.ly/acreedorigins
I stopped playing Assassin’s Creed
games around Black Flag, when the
sheer number of games in the series
overtook my appetite to play them.
I’ve always liked the formula, though,
and Origins offers the perfect time
and place to jump back in. I’m glad it
continues Ubisoft’s weird tradition of
having a bird be your binoculars.

DIABLOIII

The benefit of not playing a 
regularly updated game for years is 
that, when you finally return, it’s full 
of new stuff. Recently in Diablo III, I 
opened up a Rift to a dungeon full of 
demonic hell cows. I cleared floor 
after floor, blasting through the 
bovine hordes and chasing down 
tens of treasure goblins.

TALESFROMTHEBORDERLANDS
www.talesfromtheborderlands.com
For me, this is not only the best
Telltale game, but the best
Borderlands game, too. It’s a clever
setting for Telltale’s post-Walking
Dead formula, because its dialogue
options ask what kind of joke you
want to tell. Arguably that means
many of its choices don’t matter, but
also that they matter a lot.

EMILYISAWAYTOO

This brief, episodic adventure
about being online in the early-’00s
feels pretty relatable to me, someone
who was actually there. It’s well
observed – whether it’s the
multicoloured song lyrics as IM
profile text, or tabbing between chat
windows to share music and talk
about IRL drama.

NIGHT IN THE WOODS 
www.nightinthewoods.com
 Night in the Woods gave me a 
peculiar sense of nostalgia for a life 
I’ve never lived in a culture that isn’t 
my own, which is an impressive trick 
to pull. I’m also a sucker for games 
that use music in clever ways, and 
NitW is full of neat audio flourishes 
that pull you through its mix of small 
town drama and eerie folklore.

GWENT:THEWITCHER
CARDGAME
www.playgwent.com
CD Projekt Red have made big
changes to Gwent since its Witcher III
incarnation, expanding the role of
factions to create something much
more complex. I’m only just starting
to figure out this new version, but
already the potential for interesting
decks feels exciting.

QUADRILATERALCOWBOY
www.blendogames.com/qc
 I like the idea of games about 
programming, but rarely enjoy them. 
I find the possibility space of games 
like else Heart.Break() amazing, but 
also off-putting. Quadrilateral 
Cowboy is one of the few I’ve taken 
to, partly because the heist fiction 
helps soften the fact you’re just 
writing door3.open(3) into a parser.
