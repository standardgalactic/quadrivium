About the Author
Brian Underdahl is the best-selling author of over 70 books, numerous maga-
zine articles, and dozens of Web pieces. He has appeared on a number of TV
shows as an expert on computing and has taught many different computer
courses.
Brian loves to play with the newest gadgets, and he gets a lot of enjoyment
out of making computers easier to understand and use for people who don’t
have the time to wade through all the gory details on their own. When he isn’t
typing at the keyboard, you’ll often find Brian preparing a gourmet meal at his
home in the mountains above Reno, Nevada. His wife enjoys that part, too.


Author’s Acknowledgments
I have to admit that it’s a lot of fun seeing my name on the cover of a book.
But it’s probably a little unfair that only one name gets listed there because
there are so many other people who helped make the book into a reality. To
address this, I’d like to thank a whole bunch of people who made the book
possible. They include:
Tiffany Franklin, Andy Cummings, Chris Morris, and a raft full of other great
folks at Wiley Publishing.
Jim Kelly, my technical reviewer.

Cheong, Ph.D. and Abe Wu, Space Machine; Phil Weiler, Symantec; Marleen
Winer, TeleType; Andrew Wong, Veo; Charles Oliva and Andrew Grosso,
Vindigo; and Nicole Rund, Zagat.
I’m sure there are many others whose names I’ve misplaced in the confusion
that passes for writing a book. For that I apologize.

iPAQ For Dummies 
xvi

Introduction
S
everal different manufacturers make Pocket PCs, but none are as popular
as the iPAQ. The iPAQ has the style, the power, and the features to make
it the best PDA there is. That Hewlett-Packard is able to pack so much into
such a convenient little package is a true marvel of modern engineering.
In this book, I cover hundreds of neat and fun ways to make use of your iPAQ.
In reading this book, I hope you get lots of enjoyment and see just how much
you really can do with your iPAQ!
About This Book
iPAQ For Dummies is a hands-on guide that uses real-world examples to show
you just what you need to know about iPAQs and why you want to know it. You
don’t find a lot of hype or jargon. You do find useful information presented
clearly and concisely.
iPAQ For Dummies is also a reference that you can use according to your own
style. If you’re already somewhat familiar with your iPAQ, you can skip around
to find out about things that you’re a little unsure of. If you’re new to iPAQs,
you may want to read the entire book. Either way, you’re bound to find out
lots of little things — and some very important and useful ones.
Finally, iPAQ For Dummies is primarily about the new iPAQ Windows Mobile
2003 systems. It can also be useful for owners of older iPAQs, of course, but
the focus is on the newest models and the features that are unique to them.
Conventions Used in This Book
I use a few conventions in this book to make it easier for you to spot special
information. Here are those conventions:
 New terms are identified by using italic.
 Web site addresses (URLs) are designated by using a monospace font.

 Any command that you enter at a command prompt is shown in bold and
usually set on a separate line. Set-off text in italic represents a placeholder.
For example, the text might read:
At the command prompt, enter the command in the following format:
ping IPaddress
The IPaddress part is the IP address of the remote computer that you
want to query.
 Command arrows, which are typeset as ➪, are used in a list of menus
and options. For example, Tools➪Options means to choose the Tools
menu and then choose the Options command.
 Key combinations are shown with a plus sign, such as Ctrl+F2. This means
that you should hold down the Ctrl key while you press the F2 key.
What You’re Not to Read
If you’re really looking for a book about how to miniaturize your desktop PC so
that you can stuff it into your pocket, you can probably skip this entire book.
Otherwise, you may want to read most of it — especially if you’re interested
in knowing why and not just how things work on your iPAQ. Still, I recognize
that you may not want to waste any time on technical explanations. If so, you
can skip the text next to the Technical Stuff icons. You can possibly skip a few
other things, too, if you really want to. For example, you can certainly skip the
chapter on choosing your iPAQ if you already own one of the newer models.
Foolish Assumptions
Making assumptions is always a gamble because they can quickly come back
to haunt you. However, in writing this book I made some assumptions about
you. This book is for you if:
 You have an iPAQ and want to know how to get the most from it.
 You don’t have an iPAQ yet, but are wondering whether you should 
get one.
 You have a different type of PDA and are thinking of upgrading to an iPAQ.
 You have one of the original iPAQs, and you want to discover what’s new
and improved in the new iPAQs.
 You want to see how an iPAQ can make travel fun again.

iPAQ For Dummies 

 You want to find out if it really is possible to surf the Internet while
you’re sitting at that coffee shop.
 You’re tired of lugging around a laptop and want to see how you can get
real work done with an iPAQ.
 You want to complete your framed set of The 5th Wave cartoons.
How This Book Is Organized
iPAQ For Dummies has seven parts. Each part is self-contained, but you also
find that the parts are somewhat interconnected. That way, you see the most
useful information without a lot of boring repetition.
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ
Part I lays the foundation for getting to know your iPAQ. You discover how your
iPAQ compares with other computers that you may have used in the past and
you discover how to take advantage of the iPAQ’s unique features. If you’re still
deciding which iPAQ best suits your needs, you get some help choosing the
correct model. You find out how to use all the basic features of your iPAQ
quickly and efficiently. Finally, you find out how to interact with your iPAQ,
including how to make use of the great handwriting recognition software that’s
built into your system.
Part II: Personal Organization 
with Your iPAQ
Part II shows you how to use your iPAQ to help keep your personal life in order.
You see how your iPAQ can keep track of your address book, act as your per-
sonal note taker, and help you manage your schedule no matter how hectic
your life may seem.
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work
Part III shows you how to use the powerful yet easy-to-use applications that are
built into your iPAQ, the ones that set it apart from those other, less powerful
palm-sized devices some people use. You see how to use Pocket Word to read,
edit, and create Word documents. You discover how Pocket Excel gives you
3
Introduction

most of the power of your desktop PC’s Excel program right in the palm of
your hand. You see how Pocket Money, Pocket Quicken, and some other
applications make it easy for you to track your expenses on the go.
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet
Part IV describes how you can use your iPAQ to access the Internet as well as
how to connect directly to your network. Here you see just how convenient it
is to be able to surf the Internet and handle your e-mail from wherever you
happen to be. You see how you can make use of the exciting new wireless
Internet options as well as the more familiar wired connections. You haven’t
surfed until you’ve done it on an iPAQ miles away from your desktop.
Part V: Multimedia Time
Part V shows you how to have some fun with your iPAQ. In this part, you see
why an iPAQ can be a great musical companion, how you can read all sorts of
the new electronic books on your iPAQ, how to make your iPAQ into the perfect
partner for your digital camera, and why your iPAQ is the ultimate handheld
game machine. In addition, you see that your iPAQ can even become a great
tool for PowerPoint presentations with the right accessories.
Part VI: Working with iPAQ Add-Ons
Part VI shows you some of the many great ways to add even more utility to
your iPAQ by adding new programs, and how your iPAQ can be a great travel-
ing companion. You see where to find iPAQ programs, how to install them,
and how to make the ones you want fit into the available space. You find out
the essential information that you need to make traveling with your iPAQ a
truly enjoyable experience.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens provides information on some great ways to enhance your
iPAQ by showing you the best iPAQ accessories. I included a chapter that shows
you some of the best business-related iPAQ programs and a chapter on ways
to enjoy your iPAQ. You see some great ways to get even more productivity
from your iPAQ. I don’t leave out those of you who just have to tinker and
tweak, either. I even included a chapter that shows you some nifty utilities
that let you really take control of your iPAQ.

Icons in This Book
iPAQ For Dummies includes icons that point out special information. Here are
the icons that I use and what they mean:
Technical Stuff is information for folks who want to know all the gory details.
You can probably skip this stuff unless you really find it interesting.
This icon is the one that can make you seem like a real iPAQ expert in no
time. It highlights special tricks and shortcuts that make using iPAQ even
easier. Don’t miss any of these!
Be careful when you see this icon. It points out an area where you want to be
extra cautious so that you don’t cause yourself problems. It also tells you how
to avoid the problems.
The Note icon steers you to additional information about iPAQs.
Where to Go from Here
You are about to find out just how much fun an iPAQ really can be. As you read
through iPAQ For Dummies, you notice that I emphasize ways to really become
more efficient and comfortable with using your iPAQ, but I guarantee that you
can have fun doing so. Feel free to jump around, but I suggest that you start
with Chapter 1 for a good introduction to your iPAQ.

t’s really pretty amazing that something as sleek and small as an iPAQ can
be so useful and fun. The latest iPAQ models have the power to do all sorts
of cool things such as making sure you never miss an important date, letting
you find your way in strange places without having to ask for directions, or
even responding to spoken commands. And they do it all in a stylish little
package that easily fits into your pocket. 
This chapter shows you a number of things that you can do with an iPAQ. If you
don’t have an iPAQ yet or if you have an older model iPAQ, you can discover
just how great the newer models really are. Chapter 1 is, of course, just a quick
overview, and I can’t show you everything in just a few pages. But even in this
limited space, you can get a feeling for why iPAQ fans don’t want to be with-
out their iPAQ.
Understanding Your iPAQ
So just what is an iPAQ, anyway? Is it a real PC, and does it really fit into a
pocket? Do you look like a propeller-head as soon as you pull it out and start

using it? Here are some basics about the iPAQ to answer some of these types
of questions:
 An iPAQ is a Pocket PC — a real computer that’s been shrunk down into
a very small package. In fact, the smallest of the iPAQs (the h1900 line) is
just about four and a half inches tall, two and a half inches wide, and
about a half inch thick. The other iPAQ models are a bit larger, but still
small enough to fit an average-sized pocket.
 Don’t shove your iPAQ into your back jeans pocket. It makes an uncom-
fortable lump and it probably won’t survive being sat upon — even if it
really does fit into that pocket.
 iPAQs and Palm PCs use completely different operating systems (OS), mean-
ing that they can’t run each other’s programs. Make certain any programs
you buy specifically state that they are designed for the iPAQ (or the
Pocket PC 2003).
 The iPAQ OS is technically a version of Windows called Windows Mobile,
but this doesn’t mean that you can run your favorite Windows-based pro-
grams on your iPAQ. You need special iPAQ versions of any programs that
you want to run. Because the iPAQ OS is based on Windows, at least you
won’t have to learn new ways of doing things; most of what you know about
using Windows-based programs still applies on your iPAQ. Figure 1-1 shows
an example of the iPAQ screen when Pocket Excel has a document open.
 As for the question about whether you look like a propeller-head when
you pull out your iPAQ, I don’t really know. But maybe there are worse
things in the world than having the coolest toy on the block!

Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

What’s New in iPAQs?
As great as the first iPAQs were, the new iPAQ systems represent a big step
forward in putting real computing power into your pocket. Here are some of
the changes that you can find in the latest iPAQ systems:
 iPAQs are available in more sizes. In addition to the models like the h5550/
5555, which are available in the original iPAQ dimensions, you can now
buy iPAQs that are even smaller. A variety of sizes ensures that you have a
better chance of finding exactly the one you want when you go shopping.
 The OS and built-in applications have once again been upgraded. It’s true
that all iPAQs have upgradeable flash memory and this means that both
the iPAQ OS and the built-in applications can be upgraded, but the newer
models already have the latest upgrades installed.
 All of the new iPAQ systems now use a trans-reflective display that can
show 65,536 colors. This is a huge improvement over the displays on
some earlier iPAQs because you can now view pictures in full color, and
more importantly, you can now see the display quite well in bright sun-
light! If you add a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to your iPAQ,
you can easily see the display in your car or when you’re out hiking.
 All iPAQs now have built-in expansion slots. Some even have a second
memory expansion slot for CF (CompactFlash) memory cards in addition
to the standard SD (Secure Digital) expansion slot. This second memory

Chapter 1: Getting to Know the iPAQ
Finding some real power in your pocket
Sure, an iPAQ may seem like a cool toy, but can
something that size actually be a powerful com-
puter? Yes: It not only can but it is. Consider for
just a moment how far PCs have advanced in
just a few short years. Comparing an iPAQ with
a desktop PC, here are some interesting points:
 The brain (okay, the processor for all you
technical types) inside the iPAQ is function-
ally as powerful as the fastest desktop PC
processors of two or three years ago.
 Your iPAQ has as much memory as most
desktop systems of just a few years ago.
 An iPAQ is typically able to run for an entire
workday on a single charge — all the more
amazing when you consider that the battery
is inside that pocket-sized package along
with the processor, the memory, the display,
and all the other components.
 iPAQs are ready to use immediately. Touch
a button and you can instantly pick up right
where you left off without waiting for the
system to boot up (because it doesn’t have
to boot up the way your desktop PC does).
 The iPAQ runs special versions of programs
you’re already familiar with such as Word
and Excel. You can even share your docu-
ment files between your iPAQ and your
desktop PC.

slot opens up a whole new world of possibilities because you can have all
the advantages of expanded memory capabilities and still use a device
such as a GPS receiver, a digital camera attachment, a Bluetooth card, a
wireless network adapter, or whatever else you might want to add. For
example, by adding a 256MB SD memory card, you can store your GPS
receiver detailed maps that cover a large part of the country, or you can
store a full-length movie that you can watch during a cross-country flight.
 The newer iPAQs come equipped with more base memory than their ear-
lier iPAQ counterparts.
 Many iPAQ models include built-in Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or both so that you
can connect wirelessly. In fact, these new wireless communications capa-
bilities are probably some of the most important changes you’ll find in
the new iPAQs because they open up so many important options for
you. Figure 1-2 shows an example of how this capability allows you to
browse the Internet on the go. 
One problem you may encounter is deciding which iPAQ is the right one for
you. Because all of the options are now so great, it’s much harder making that
choice. Now your choice is more likely to come down to some of the extras
that a particular model offers rather than simply choosing the one with the
best basic design. Some models offer more expansion possibilities than others,
Figure 1-2:

the new
iPAQs.
12
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

and some just seem to fit into an ordinary pocket a little better. Regardless of
their differences, it’s hard to go wrong, no matter which iPAQ you choose.
Chapter 2 discusses the different iPAQ models so that you can choose the one
that best suits your needs.
Although this book intentionally covers the latest iPAQ models, much of what
you will find in these pages also applies to the older iPAQs. This is especially
true if you obtain upgrade discs to update your existing iPAQ to the current
software versions.
Your Desktop PC’s Partner
Even though your iPAQ is a powerful computer on its own, thinking of your
desktop PC and your iPAQ as partners is probably the best way to go. They
make a great team, and both have features that complement the other. It’s
just a fact that some things you simply wouldn’t want to do with one or the
other. For example:
 Even though you can type on the onscreen keyboard or use the hand-
writing recognition feature to enter data into your iPAQ, you aren’t likely
to use either one when you type in your great novel. Your desktop PC
keyboard works better when you need to enter lots of text. Sure, you can
get a folding keyboard for your iPAQ, but somehow it’s not quite the
same thing.
 On the other hand, your desktop PC or even your notebook PC doesn’t
fit into a shirt pocket — no matter how big your shirts may be. When
you’re on the go, your iPAQ gives you access to your files in a package
that’s easy to carry along.
Figure 1-3 shows how to write notes directly on your iPAQ’s screen. Of
course, if your handwriting is as bad as mine, you may end up with some
interesting results after you click the Recognize command.
What really makes the PC and iPAQ partnership work is that you can easily
share files between the two. In fact, it’s very easy to designate certain files
(or even entire folders) that you want to synchronize between your iPAQ and
desktop PC. Then, whenever you connect them, those files are automatically
updated. So, if you add a new person to your iPAQ address list, that person is
added to your desktop PC’s address list without any further effort on your
part. Of course, your address list is just one example. You can also synchro-
nize your calendar, your résumé, or even your wine collection database. The
possibilities are endless.
13
Chapter 1: Getting to Know the iPAQ

You can set up partnerships between your iPAQ and two different desktop
PCs, making your iPAQ a great way to develop the same document on the PC
in your office and the one in your home. Having said that, be sure to read the
following paragraph. . . .
Even though you can partner your iPAQ with two desktop PCs, you can syn-
chronize your e-mail with only one desktop PC. If you need to have the same
e-mail messages on two different desktop PCs, you may want to configure the
e-mail program on one of them to leave messages on the server, and then
download those messages on the second PC later. Alternatively, you can con-
nect directly to your mail server through your iPAQ without even bothering
with your desktop system.
If you’re a real iPAQ fanatic like me, it’s possible to set up partnerships between
any number of iPAQs and a single desktop system. You need to be aware of a
few caveats, however. First, each iPAQ needs a unique name (you find more
on this topic in Chapter 3), and second, only one iPAQ can connect at a time.
Most iPAQ owners don’t have to worry about this, of course, but it can get
interesting connecting several different iPAQs to a single desktop system!

Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Putting Some Multimedia in Your Pocket
The next time you want to make other people jealous, just whip out your
iPAQ and start using some of its multimedia capabilities. Because your iPAQ
is a real computer that has both fantastic sound and video capabilities built-
in, it’s great at playing music and displaying color images, as well as letting
you read your e-mail. You can’t find many other devices that can do all that
and still fit into your pocket!
Putting music in your pocket
You’ve probably seen those little pocket-sized gadgets that people use to
download music from the Internet or audio CDs so they can carry their
favorite music with them. What you may not realize is that your iPAQ not
only serves the same function, but offers plenty of advantages over those
single-purpose music players, too.
Music you download is usually stored in either an MP3 (MPEG version 3) or a
WMA (Windows Media Audio) file. These are two different ways of compress-
ing audio files so they don’t take so much storage room. After you load either
type of file into your iPAQ (or standalone music player), you can play back
the music almost as if you were playing an audio CD. See Chapter 15 for more
about using your iPAQ as a portable music player.
MP3 and WMA files don’t sound quite as good as the originals because both
types of compression are lossy — some of the audio signal data is tossed out,
or lost, to make the files smaller. You probably won’t notice much difference,
though, because you most likely play the music back through a tiny set of
earphones on your iPAQ or music player. Unless you’re a musician, you may
not even detect the lower quality if you play the music back through a high-
end stereo system. The quality difference between the original and the com-
pressed file isn’t likely to be very significant in most listening environments.
When choosing the format for audio files for your iPAQ, choose WMA rather
than MP3. WMA files can be as small as half the size of similar sounding 
MP3 files.
Putting images in your pocket
In addition to playing back your favorite music, you can also view images on
the iPAQ screen. Of course, at 240 pixels wide by 320 pixels high, the iPAQ
screen has just one-fourth the display capability of a plain old Video Graphics
15
Chapter 1: Getting to Know the iPAQ

Array (VGA) monitor, but the iPAQ does have to fit in your pocket, after all.
(Pixels are picture elements — the number of dots that can appear on the
screen per line.)
Even though the iPAQ screen has to be small enough to fit into your pocket,
that doesn’t mean that you have to get eyestrain from viewing the iPAQ’s
screen. In Chapter 4 you find out about a slick little clip-on magnifier that can
really make your iPAQ screen much easier to read.
A lot has changed since the iPAQ was first introduced. At that time, a
PowerPoint viewer wasn’t available, and you couldn’t show PowerPoint 
slide shows with your iPAQ. Now you have several different ways to show
PowerPoint slide shows using an iPAQ. In fact, as you discover in Chapter 20,
you can even connect your iPAQ to a video projector, a large screen TV, or 
a standard computer monitor so that the slide show can easily be seen by
whatever size crowd you have assembled (and you’re no longer limited to the
240 x 320 iPAQ screen resolution, either). It’s hard to imagine a more conve-
nient way to bring along a PowerPoint presentation than in your iPAQ.
The iPAQ as Your Personal Assistant
Just about everyone could use some help keeping track of schedules, con-
tacts, and to-do lists. The first PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) were cre-
ated primarily to fulfill just this set of functions.
The iPAQ serves as a superb personal assistant. It’s got a built-in calendar so
that you can maintain your schedule. It’s got a great contact manager so that
you can always remember those important details — such as someone’s birth-
day. It even has a task manager that helps you get your to-do list in order (even
if it’s still up to you to actually do the tasks).
Oh sure, you’re probably saying something like, “I can do all that stuff with
this little paper notebook I carry.” But have you considered how much more
convenient the iPAQ makes these tasks? Here are just a few ways the iPAQ
beats out the little paper notebook method:
 The iPAQ always has a correct calendar for any date — whether it’s next
week, next year, or two years from now. You can easily schedule an
appointment for any date and time you choose.
 Adding a new contact or changing someone’s information is always easy
in the iPAQ contact list. You don’t have to worry about finding room on
the right page because you can add as many new contacts as necessary
and they always appear in just the right place.
16
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

 You can set a reminder so that your iPAQ automatically lets you know
when you’re supposed to do something. (Your paper notebook is per-
fectly happy to just sit there and let you forget about that important
dinner date.)
 With the right software, you can even have your iPAQ read your appoint-
ments aloud so that you can hear your schedule. Try getting your paper
notebook to match that!
Figure 1-4 shows an example of how you can keep track of your schedule by
using your iPAQ.
Keeping in Touch While on the Go
Do you ever experience e-mail withdrawal if you have to go without access to
your messages for a few days (or even just a few hours if you’re a really con-
nected person)? With an iPAQ, you no longer have to do without e-mail, instant
messaging, the Internet, or the latest beach-cam shot. Your iPAQ has the Pocket
Internet Explorer and Pocket Inbox built right in, so you can access all of that
from almost anywhere and at just about any time you like.
Figure 1-4:

Chapter 1: Getting to Know the iPAQ

You have lots of options for connecting on the go — some may suit your
needs better than others. For example, here are a few of the methods you
may use to connect your iPAQ to the Internet:
 If you have access to a telephone line, you can use a modem that fits
into the expansion slot on your iPAQ. This type of connection typically
requires a CompactFlash (CF) type of modem, such as the Pretec
Compact Modem (www.pretec.com) or the Socket 56K Modem CF Card
(www.socketcom.com). Using this type of modem, you can access your
regular Internet service provider (ISP), and unless you’re making a toll
call, you don’t typically pay any extra for the service because you can
use the same Internet account that you use on your desktop PC.
 If you live in selected areas, you may be able to access the Web using
a wireless modem such as one of the Sierra Wireless units (www.
SierraWireless.com). This type of access is generally more expensive
and slower than wired access through a phone line, but you can’t beat
the convenience of accessing your e-mail or browsing the Web without
having to look for a telephone jack.
 If you have a cell phone, you may be able to get an adapter that con-
nects your iPAQ to your phone. If so, you can access the Internet either
through your wireless phone service provider or by dialing in to your
regular ISP. Of course, you use some of your airtime minutes whenever
you connect. You also need to make certain that you get the correct
adapter specific to the exact make and model of your cell phone.
 Finally, Wi-Fi hotspots (places where you can connect to the Internet on
the go) are becoming very popular, and several iPAQ models have the
required 802.11b Wi-Fi radios built-in. (You can also buy Wi-Fi adapters
to fit any iPAQ model.) This is probably the best way to connect on the
go because the same Wi-Fi signal can connect you to your wireless net-
work in your home or office. In addition, Wi-Fi connections are far faster
than any of the other options (and usually less expensive).
Chapter 12 is the place to look to find out everything you need to know about
connecting your iPAQ on the go. There I discuss your hardware options as
well as explain how to make it all work.
Unfortunately, I’ve found a couple downsides to browsing the Web on the rel-
atively small iPAQ screen. For one thing, you have to spend so much time
scrolling the display that browsing isn’t always tons of fun. (However, I show
you another option that may work better for you in Chapter 13.) For another,
typing in Web site URLs on that tiny on-screen keyboard gets old pretty fast.
Still, it’s pretty cool to be able to whip out your iPAQ and get on the Web.
Being able to send and receive e-mail wherever you are is pretty slick, too.
18
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Reading eBooks
Just owning an iPAQ is a good indication that you’re the type of person who
likes to make the best use of your time. The iPAQ adds one more element that
helps you to do even more — eBooks.
eBooks are electronic books that you can download into your iPAQ and read
on the screen. At first glance, you may wonder just how readable a book on
the iPAQ screen can be — even a small paperback book has larger pages.
Surprisingly, though, the iPAQ makes eBooks very easy and enjoyable to
read. For example, I have found that the downloadable Rough Guides, which
are available for a number of major travel destinations, can make you a real
expert on having a great time when you’re traveling. You can find the Rough
Guides at www.roughguides.com.
Among the things that make eBooks easy to read, none is quite as important
as something called ClearType Technology, a method of making even small-
sized text extremely easy to read. ClearType Technology works its magic by
making very subtle changes in the way characters are displayed. In a sense,
ClearType makes it seem like your iPAQ’s screen has higher resolution than it
actually does. Certain iPAQ models even allow you to adjust your ClearType
settings for improved readability.
Of course, the backlighting on the iPAQ screen also contributes to improved
readability, too. Backlighting is the light that makes the screen on your iPAQ
bright — it’s light that comes from behind the images on the screen. With
backlighting, you don’t need to hold a flashlight next to your ear as you read
under the covers late at night (or whatever other dark place you prefer for
reading scary stories).
A number of publishers and booksellers, including Amazon.com and Barnes &
Noble, offer eBooks. Often you can download an eBook for free, but even when
you have to pay for one, the cost is surprisingly low. With no printing, ware-
housing, or stocking costs to jack up the price, eBooks can be a real bargain.
You can find a huge collection of downloadable eBooks in the Microsoft
eBook Catalog at www.mslit.com. With a wireless Internet connection you
can even download them directly to your iPAQ without first going through
your desktop PC.

B
ack in the ancient times (a few years ago), choosing the right iPAQ model
was pretty easy. Only a few choices existed, so if you wanted an iPAQ, you
just bought whatever model was available at the time. In our more modern era,
choosing your iPAQ is much more complicated because you have so many
more options.
In this chapter, you see how the different iPAQ model lines compare with each
other so that you can have an easier time deciding which iPAQ best fits your
needs. You may be surprised to find out just how great a selection of options is
available. These aren’t your father’s iPAQs!
Before we begin our look at the iPAQ model lines, it’s important for you to keep
in mind the fact that the available models can and do change often. This chap-
ter represents a snapshot in time, and some new iPAQ choices may be avail-
able by the time you read this. But despite that, the information that you find
here can help you to make a better decision as you choose your iPAQ.
Model Number Mayhem: Understanding
the iPAQ Models
One of the biggest problems you face in selecting the best iPAQ to suit your
needs is that so many different iPAQ models are available. To make matters
worse, as Figure 2-1 shows, they don’t really look all that different from each
other, either.

Although the iPAQ models look pretty similar on the outside, a number of
very important differences lurk on the inside, and these differences can ulti-
mately help you choose your favorite iPAQ. The following sections provide
more details about the current iPAQ model lines.

Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 
What’s this 0/5 stuff?
When shopping for an iPAQ, you may have
noticed that some identical iPAQ models some-
times have different model numbers. For exam-
ple, take the h2210 and the h2215: If you
compare the specifications of these two, they
appear identical, and in reality, they are identi-
cal twins. So why, you ask, are there two differ-
ent model numbers for the same device?
The answer to that question is pretty simple and
maybe just a bit silly. Hewlett-Packard (HP) sells
the iPAQs through dealers, but HP also sells
them directly to end users (that’s you and me)
through their online store. The two model num-
bers make it possible for HP to sell “different”
iPAQ models directly and through their dealers
so that HP can claim that they aren’t in compe-
tition with the independent dealers.
The bottom line: It doesn’t matter if the final digit
in the model number is a zero or a five. As long
as the other three numbers match, it’s the same
iPAQ.

h1900 series highlights
The h1900 series is the smallest and least expensive of the current iPAQ
models. But that doesn’t mean that they aren’t really iPAQs. They are, in fact,
extremely well equipped — especially considering how little you have to
spend for them. Check out Figure 2-2.
Here are the specifics of the h1900 model iPAQs:
 3.5-inch trans-reflective, 65,536 color display
 Samsung 2410 processor (203 MHz or 266 MHz)
 Windows Mobile 2003 Professional
 64MB RAM (short for random access memory)
 4.46 x 2.75 x 0.5 inches in size
 4.37 oz weight
 Multi-color notification light-emitting diode (LED) indicator
 Removable, rechargeable, 900 mAh Lithium-Ion battery with an esti-
mated 8-hour usage
 Integrated SDIO slot that supports both SD and MMC cards — both
memory and I/O
 Microphone, speaker, one 2.5 mm headphone jack, MP3 stereo (through
audio jack)
 A suite of applications in addition to those standard in Windows Mobile
2003 Professional
The two current h1900 model iPAQs aren’t completely identical, however. 
The h1940/1945 has integrated Bluetooth and a slightly faster processor than
does the h1930/1935. Of these two features, the integrated Bluetooth proves
far more important to most iPAQ owners.
The headphone jack on the h1900 series iPAQ models is 2.5 mm rather than
the more common 3.5 mm size. If you want to listen to stereo music on your
h1900 series iPAQ, make certain that you buy headphones with a 2.5 mm
plug. This only applies to h1900 series models; the other iPAQ series models
include the more conventional 3.5 mm headphone jack.
h2200 series highlights
The next step up from the h1900 series iPAQs is the h2200 series. (See Figure
2-3.) They cost a little more and are a bit larger, but they also pack consider-
able power into that slightly larger package.

Here are the specifics of the h2200 model iPAQs:
 3.5-inch trans-reflective, 65,536 color display
 400 MHz Intel XScale processor
 Windows Mobile 2003 Premium
 64MB RAM
 4.54 x 3.00 x 0.61 inches in size
 5.1 oz weight
 Integrated Bluetooth
 Multi-color notification LED indicator
 Removable, rechargeable, 900 mAh Lithium-Ion battery with an esti-
mated 12-hour usage
 Integrated SDIO slot that supports both SD and MMC cards — both
memory and I/O
 Integrated CompactFlash Type I/II slot (Type II slots are capable of hold-
ing thicker adapter cards than Type I)
 Microphone, speaker, one 3.5 mm headphone jack, MP3 stereo (through
audio jack)
 A suite of applications in addition to those standard in Windows Mobile
2003 Premium including Nevo Universal Remote Control
The two built-in expansion slots are one of the most important upgrades in
the h2200 series compared to the h1900 series. With both slots, you get many
more expansion options.
h4100 series highlights
The newest iPAQ models are currently those in the h4100 (and closely related
h4300) series. These iPAQs are clearly aimed at people who want just about
everything, but don’t want to give up an extremely compact package to get it.
Take a look at Figure 2-4.
Here’s what you can find in the h4100 model iPAQs:
 3.5-inch trans-reflective, 65,536 color display
 400 MHz Intel XScale processor
 Windows Mobile 2003 Premium
 64MB RAM

The h4300 models (see Figure 4-5) also include a small, thumb-operated key-
board below the screen (which adds some additional height and weight, of
course).

Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

The h4100 series iPAQs are virtually the same size as the h1900 series, but
include both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities built-in. This series does not
include the CF expansion slot that you find in the h2200 series, but with both
wireless communications options built-in, you may not miss it.

Chapter 2: Choosing Your iPAQ
End of an era: the h5500 series
The h5500 series (and closely related h5100
series) are the big boys when it comes to iPAQ
models. This is the only iPAQ line that can
accept the traditional iPAQ expansion sleeves
(big, bulky things that slide onto the back of the
older iPAQs — but you could argue that the
other iPAQs probably don’t need that capability
because they have so many features built in).
As it happens, they also represent the end of an
era — HP has decided to stop producing these
pocket-stretchers.

Deciding Which iPAQ Is Right for You
Now that you have a better idea of how the different iPAQ models stack up,
you should have an easier time deciding which iPAQ is right for you. In the
following sections, I show you several different factors that you may want to
consider in making your choice.
What kind of iPAQ user are you?
When you get right down to it, knowing what kind of iPAQ user you’re likely
to be is one of the most important pieces of information in the whole process
of choosing the right iPAQ. Consider the following points:
 If you primarily intend to use your iPAQ to manage your schedule and
contacts, any of the models can do the job. You may as well buy one of
the h1900 iPAQs and save your money for other things.
 If you would like to use your iPAQ to help you navigate, you want to con-
sider your options in Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers. Currently
GPS receivers come in the following styles:
• Those that plug into the sync jack on the bottom of the iPAQ
• Those that plug into a CF expansion slot
• Those that communicate with your iPAQ via Bluetooth
Of these options, the Bluetooth method is by far the most convenient.
Still, this means that any iPAQ can connect to a GPS receiver as long as
you buy one to fit your iPAQ. See Chapter 19 for more information on
GPS receivers.
 If you’re one of those people who is always on the go and can’t stand
being away from your e-mail, you definitely want to consider one of the
iPAQs with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. See Chapter 12 for more informa-
tion on this subject.
It’s pretty clear that knowing what you want to do with your iPAQ helps you
choose the correct one for you. But keep in mind that you may discover a
whole lot of really cool new ways to use your iPAQ as you read this book. 
If so, you may want to choose an iPAQ that has the capability to grow with
your needs.
28
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Built-in capabilities
The various iPAQ models all are extremely capable Pocket PCs. Each of the
current models has at least 64MB of RAM. Every iPAQ now boasts an Secure
Digital Input/Output (SDIO) expansion slot so you can easily add memory or
certain Input/Output (IO) cards like the SanDisk SD Wi-Fi card shown in an
h1935 in Figure 2-6.
But even with these similarities, take some time to consider how the models
differ. For example, only the h2200 series models have two expansion slots
built-in. A single slot generally limits your expansion options, because most
expansion cards don’t offer memory in addition to other capabilities. (SanDisk
does offer a version of the SD Wi-Fi card that also has 256MB of memory). This
means that if you want to use a device that plugs into the expansion slot on
your iPAQ, you must give up the ability to add extra memory. Unfortunately,
this can somewhat limit the iPAQ’s capabilities.
Figure 2-6:

SD Wi-Fi
card enables
any iPAQ
model to

wirelessly.
29
Chapter 2: Choosing Your iPAQ

Earlier, I mention that built-in Bluetooth can be a very important feature when
choosing your iPAQ. Essentially, the built-in Bluetooth capabilities in some
iPAQ models allow you to use Bluetooth-enabled devices without filling up the
iPAQ’s expansion slot. This is especially handy if you want to use your iPAQ
for GPS navigation, because you can then add a high-capacity SD memory
card so that you have plenty of room for detailed maps.
Always be sure to check out what type of expansion slot is required before
you buy any add-ons for your iPAQ. Some devices are offered in more than
one format, but most are not. Unfortunately, you simply can’t ever use an
add-on device that fails to match the built-in capabilities of your particular
iPAQ model.
Size differences
Size really does matter — at least in choosing your iPAQ. And in this case,
smaller is generally better. But now that Hewlett-Packard (HP) has dropped
the larger format iPAQs, you really don’t have to give size too much thought,
because any of the current iPAQ models is truly small enough to fit in your
pocket.
How much smaller are the new iPAQs compared to the older models? Here’s a
rough estimate:
 The new iPAQs are about 20 percent smaller in every dimension. This
makes quite a difference in how well your iPAQ fits into an ordinary
pocket.
 The overall volume of the new series of iPAQs is only a little more than
half the size of the original iPAQs.
 The newer iPAQs are only about 60 percent as heavy as the older
models.

In This Chapter
 Using the touch screen

 Making use of the Today screen
 Adjusting your iPAQ’s settings
E
ven though the iPAQ is Windows-powered, you find lots of obvious differ-
ences between using an iPAQ and a desktop PC. (I use the term Windows-
powered here because your iPAQ uses a version of Microsoft Windows — but
probably not the version you’ve used in the past.) One of the most glaring dif-
ferences strikes most iPAQ users the first time they want to enter information:
“Where’s my keyboard?” After you get over the fact that your iPAQ doesn’t
have some standard PC features (like a keyboard), you most likely start to
wonder just how you actually use the darn thing. Well, never fear: This chapter
offers all the tools that you need to become comfortable with using an iPAQ.
(Although this chapter does cover the basics of using an iPAQ, I hold off on
most of the details about the on-screen keyboard and handwriting recognition
until Chapter 4. Those topics really do deserve a chapter all to themselves.)
Even though an iPAQ (the h4350) with an actual built-in keyboard is now
available, all the information in this chapter applies to that model, too.
Using the Touch Screen
Okay, because the typical iPAQ doesn’t have a keyboard, just how do you
interact with it? Those four or five buttons certainly don’t seem to hold much
promise, do they?
The answer is right in front of you — the iPAQ’s screen. Every iPAQ uses a
touch screen — a screen that recognizes when and where you touch the
screen with your finger or the stylus. Figure 3-1 shows several different items
to give you a better idea of how this works.

The figure shows several different areas where you touch the screen in order
to use your iPAQ. Following are some typical things you may find.
The iPAQ Start button
The Windows flag emblem in the upper-left corner of the iPAQ screen is the
Start button. Clicking this button works very much like the Start button on a
desktop PC — it displays the Start menu — but the following list explores
some important differences:
 The iPAQ Start button drops down the Start menu from the top rather
than zooming it up from the bottom. This design strategy is intended to
keep you from covering up the Start menu with your hand. In truth,
though, your Start menu probably fills up most of the screen’s height
anyway, so the location doesn’t really matter.

Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

 The top row of the Start menu displays the iPAQ equivalent of the Quick
Launch toolbar, which normally appears next to your desktop Start
button. The iPAQ Quick Launch toolbar is a little different, though,
because it changes to show the programs you use the most.
 Many (but not all) of your iPAQ applications appear on the main Start
menu, which can be a little confusing if a program you want to run doesn’t
appear on the iPAQ Start menu. The solution is simple — select the
Programs item in the lower half of the Start menu to open the Programs
folder. You can start your program from that folder by clicking the pro-
gram’s icon.
The iPAQ program menus
Because the iPAQ Start button is at the top, the program menus are now at
the bottom of the screen. (I guess that means it’s okay for your hand to cover
up a program menu but not to cover up the Start menu.)
iPAQ program menus work just like the menus on your desktop PC. You tap —
the iPAQ way of saying click — a menu to open the menu, and then tap the
menu selection you want to open. In Figure 3-2, I’ve tapped on the iPAQ Image
Viewer File menu to open that menu.
Figure 3-2:

33
Chapter 3: Understanding the iPAQ Basics

Items that are grayed-out on the iPAQ program menus are currently 
unavailable — just like on your desktop PC.
If you accidentally open the wrong menu, you can close the menu by tapping
outside the menu. This first tap outside the menu closes only the open menu,
so you need to tap again if you want to open a different menu.
Using your stylus
By now you’ve probably figured out that the iPAQ screen is too small to tap
accurately with your fingers. Sure, sometimes you may get away with point-
ing your finger in just the right place, but your luck won’t last. Tapping with
your fingers is an exercise in frustration — especially when you start trying
to type on the on-screen keyboard.
Every iPAQ comes with a stylus — a small, plastic, pen-like device that you
use to tap on or to write on your screen. Unlike a pen, though, the stylus
doesn’t contain any ink, so it won’t leave permanent marks on your screen.
It’s a good idea to buy at least one replacement stylus for your iPAQ. You won’t,
of course, give too much thought to buying one until you lose the stylus that
came with your iPAQ (or, if you absent mindedly use it as a toothpick and chew
off the end of it). One excellent alternative I like is the Belkin LaserWright 3-in-1
Stylus: It combines a stylus, a fine-point ballpoint pen, and a laser pointer in a
compact package. (Check out the Web site at www.belkin.com.)
Never use a pen or any sort of metal pointer on your iPAQ screen. Doing so
quickly does permanent damage to the screen, and it’s virtually certain that
this type of damage is explicitly excluded from your warranty.
The three basic stylus actions you use are as follows:
 Tap: To lightly touch the on-screen item you want to select or open. Lift
the stylus after you tap the item. This tap action is the equivalent of click-
ing an item on your desktop PC using the left mouse button. (In fact, I use
both click and tap interchangeably in this book.)
 Drag: To place the point of the stylus on an item on-screen and then drag
the stylus across the screen without lifting the pointer until you have
completed the selection. This action works just like holding down the
Shift key while you drag your desktop PC mouse with the left mouse
button held down.
34
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

 Tap-and-hold: To hold the stylus pointer on an item for a short time
until a context menu pops up, essentially the same as right-clicking your
desktop PC mouse. When you tap-and-hold, a series of red dots appears
around the stylus pointer to let you know that the context menu will
soon pop up.
Practice using your stylus to make certain that you understand just how long
the difference in time is between the tap and tap-and-hold actions.
Protecting your screen
No, this section isn’t about keeping your iPAQ safe from diseases. It’s about
keeping your iPAQ healthy and in good condition.
If the idea of tapping and dragging a metal pointer across your iPAQ screen
doesn’t bother you, go ahead and pull out your pen and have a go at it. If
you’d rather protect the screen from damage, I’ve got another tip for you —
buy some screen protectors for your iPAQ. Screen protectors are simply plastic
overlays that fit on top of your iPAQ screen to protect it from scratches. If you
don’t use screen protectors, you have a 100 percent chance of scratching your
screen — and probably a lot faster than you can imagine. Better safe than sorry!
Belkin also offers some excellent screen protectors for the iPAQ. Look for the
Belkin ClearScreen Overlay for Hewlett-Packard iPAQ Series.
Navigating on Your iPAQ
In this section, I don’t tell you how to find your way on the high seas (or the
low plains) by using your iPAQ. For that information, you need to turn to
Chapter 19. Rather, here I help you to find your way around the screen and
the file system inside your iPAQ.
Without a keyboard or a mouse, navigating on an iPAQ seems difficult at best.
The reality is far better, though. After you get used to using the stylus and the
buttons on the front of your iPAQ, you can easily go anywhere you want.
Opening your Start menu
The Start menu is the one item that ultimately gives you access to everything
on your iPAQ. Through this menu, you can open any program, access any file,
or adjust any of the settings that control how your iPAQ functions.
35
Chapter 3: Understanding the iPAQ Basics

Because the Start menu is so vital, it’s also easy to find. Just look for that
Windows flag in the upper-left corner and give it a tap to open the Start menu.
Do you notice how the positions of the Start button and the menu bar some-
times seem to swap places? This swapping can happen when you run an older
Windows CE-based program — one designed for Windows CE 2.x. (Windows CE
is the official name of the iPAQ’s operating system.) If the button and the bar
switch on your iPAQ, don’t worry. The change is temporary and things move
back where they belong when you run a newer iPAQ program.
Figure 3-3 shows a typical example of an iPAQ Start menu. Your Start menu
may be a little different, especially if you have installed additional programs
on your iPAQ.
If you don’t see the Start button when you first turn on your iPAQ, you may
need to press one of the buttons on the front of the unit to display the Today
screen. Your iPAQ can be set up to show the owner’s information screen
when it is first powered on, and this screen may not show the Start button.

Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

When the Start menu is open, you can click one of the icons in the top row of
the menu to quickly open one of the six most recently used applications. You
can also click one of the items further down on the menu, or you can click the
Programs folder to gain access to any of your installed programs. The sections
“Finding your stuff” and “Adjusting your Settings,” found later in this chapter,
show you how to use the Settings and Find options.
Exploring your iPAQ
One of the most useful items on the Start menu is the Programs folder. Opening
this folder is the key to running any installed program or locating any file.
Figure 3-4 shows the Programs folder on an iPAQ where I’ve installed a number
of third-party programs.
As Figure 3-4 shows, a few additional program icons aren’t currently visible.
Some are sitting off-screen below the visible icons, and some are contained in
folders, such as the Games folder. To view these additional icons, use the
scrollbar along the right edge of the screen or click the folder icon to open
the folder.
Figure 3-4:

37
Chapter 3: Understanding the iPAQ Basics

Using scrollbars on the iPAQ screen can be a little tricky. Make certain that
you place the stylus pointer tip just to the left of the right edge of the screen
and somewhere near the middle of the scrollbar slider. Then, drag the slider
up or down as needed. You can also click the up or down arrows at the ends
of the scrollbar, but it’s really easy to select an icon instead of hitting the
arrow in the right place.
Opening the File Explorer
You open a program or folder by clicking it with the stylus. To open the File
Explorer, click the File Explorer icon (refer to Figure 3-4), and then the My
Documents folder opens, as shown in Figure 3-5.
Just as in recent versions of desktop Windows, the File Explorer on an iPAQ
first displays the My Documents folder (more than a mere coincidence). The
My Documents folder is one of the most important folders on your iPAQ. Many
iPAQ applications find only documents that are in the My Documents folder. If
you place document files anywhere else, you have to navigate with the File
Explorer, find the document file, and then click to open it in the application.

38
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

If you add a memory card to your iPAQ so that you can store additional files,
make certain that you create a My Documents folder on the memory card. If
you store your documents, music, pictures, and so on in this folder, your
iPAQ applications can locate those files without additional fuss and bother on
your part.
Navigating your files and folders
Click a file or folder to open it. If you click a file, your iPAQ first tries to open
the application that is associated with the type of file you clicked. For example,
if you click a Word document, the document opens in Pocket Word because
the Word application is associated with the Word document. Sometimes,
though, no application is associated with a file type, and your iPAQ isn’t able
to open the file. This usually happens when you click a file other than one of
the document file types. You can simply ignore files that aren’t associated with
applications — they may actually be necessary to the operation of various pro-
grams on your iPAQ, but may not be intended to be opened by you. Whatever
you do, don’t delete or move files that you can’t open, because this could pre-
vent you from using some of the applications that are installed on your iPAQ.
When you open a folder, you can then view any files or subfolders that the
folder contains. In some cases, you may end up several levels deep into the
file system before you realize that you wish you’d left a trail of breadcrumbs
to help you find your way back. Fortunately, navigating back up the folder
tree is easy, even if the method doesn’t seem obvious at first. Figure 3-6 gives
you the clue.
Figure 3-6:

39
Chapter 3: Understanding the iPAQ Basics

Just below the Start button is a row that normally shows the name of the cur-
rent folder and the sort method used to display the items in the folder. In
Figure 3-6, I selected Personal to drop down the navigation list. Select one of
the folder names in the list to move back up the folder tree to the folder that
you clicked.
When you select the folder name to drop down the navigation list, the folder
name drops down to the bottom of the list, and the word Show appears where
the folder name was, which tells you that selecting one of the folder names in
the navigation list shows you the contents of that folder.
You can also use the My Device, Storage Card, or Network Shares icons in the
menu bar to quickly navigate through the file system. You may need to set up
a special user account to access shared network folders.
To create a new folder, choose Edit➪New Folder from the menu bar at the
bottom of the File Explorer window. Use the on-screen keyboard to type in a
new name for the folder, and then press the Enter key. (The Enter key is indi-
cated by a bent arrow that looks like the one on your desktop PC’s Enter key.)
Working with your files
In addition to simply opening a file on your iPAQ, you can perform many of the
same file management functions that you do on your desktop PC. The trick is
to know how to access these functions. On your desktop PC, you can open a
context-sensitive menu by right-clicking a file. On the iPAQ, you do the same by
using the tap-and-hold method. That is, rather than a quick tap, press lightly
with the stylus and don’t let up until the menu pops up, as Figure 3-7 shows.
(It wasn’t possible to show this in the figure, but as you hold the stylus down,
a ring of red dots appears around the stylus’s screen position to indicate that
you have activated the tap-and-hold menu.)
Before deleting files from your iPAQ, you may want to back them up on your
desktop system. You find out more about backing up (and synchronizing)
files in Chapter 5, but for now it’s important to remember that backing up 
and synchronizing aren’t the same thing. Synchronizing does copy certain
files between your iPAQ and your desktop PC, but doesn’t protect those files
from being lost if they’re accidentally deleted in either place. If you delete a
synchronized file from your iPAQ, that file is also deleted from your desktop
system the next time you synchronize files — unless you move the file out 
of the Pocket_PC My Documents folder on your desktop system before you
allow the files to synchronize. In reality, synchronizing makes certain that the
same versions of certain files you’ve selected are on your iPAQ and your
desktop PC, and that anything you do to those files on either PC will also be
done to the same files on the other PC.

Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Finding your stuff
As small as your iPAQ is, it’s still large enough to have plenty of hiding places
for your files. And just like on your desktop PC, the files you need the most are
the ones you probably can’t find when you really need them. But those files
can’t hide forever — especially when you know the secret to finding them.
To find those errant files, click the Start button and choose Find to display
the Find program. If you know the name of the file, click the down arrow to
the right of the Find drop-down list box and use the on-screen keyboard to
enter the name. If you want to look for files by type rather than by name,
make certain that the Find drop-down list box contains < . . . > so that
any filename can be found. The < . . . > simply means that you aren’t
specifying a filename — it’s the equivalent of *.* on your desktop PC. Be
sure to delete any name that is currently showing in the Find drop-down list
box so that < . . . > appears if you want to find all files of a specific type.
To specify the type of file that you want to find, click the down arrow next to
the Type drop-down list box, as shown in Figure 3-8. Select the type of file you
want and then click Go to begin the search.

Chapter 3: Understanding the iPAQ Basics

Switching between programs
Your iPAQ can do quite a few different things at the same time. You don’t have
to close Pocket Word in order to work on a Pocket Excel worksheet, nor do you
have to close Internet Explorer in order to read your e-mail. But you do need to
be able to switch between different programs easily if you want to make effec-
tive use of several different iPAQ capabilities this way.
If you’re accustomed to using Windows on your desktop PC, you know that
you can keep several programs open and switch between them with a variety
of techniques. Two of the most common ways to switch are by clicking a pro-
gram’s Taskbar button or by pressing Alt+Tab to use the Task Switcher. If you
decide to try these techniques on your iPAQ, though, you’re immediately
faced with a couple of problems:
 To save precious screen real estate, the iPAQ doesn’t have a Taskbar
running along the bottom of the screen. This pretty much cuts out the
click-a-program’s-Taskbar-button option, doesn’t it?
 Pressing Alt+Tab is also kind of hard when you don’t have a keyboard.
(And don’t even think about trying to do this using the on-screen 
keyboard — it simply won’t work.)
Figure 3-8:

42
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Looks like you need a different method to switch between running programs on
your iPAQ. You can switch to a different program by choosing it from the Start
menu or by selecting it from the set of icons at the top of the Start menu.
You may expect that choosing a program from the Start menu or the Home
menu runs the risk of starting a second copy of a program that’s already run-
ning. However, the iPAQ’s operating system prevents this. Only one copy of
any particular program can run at any time, and only one document can be
open in a program. You cannot, for example, have two different documents
open in Pocket Word at the same time — although you can have a Pocket
Word document open and a Note document open at the same time.
Depending on the iPAQ model you have, you may have an additional way to
switch between open applications. Figure 3-9 shows the iTask Task Switcher
program that’s available on certain iPAQ models. (You find it in the Programs
folder if your model has it.) When you open iTask, simply tap the application
that you want to switch to in the pop-up list.
Closing programs
By now, you’re probably getting the idea that you have to do a few things a
little differently on your iPAQ than what you’re used to on your desktop
system. It should come as no surprise, then, that closing iPAQ programs is
just a little different, too.

Chapter 3: Understanding the iPAQ Basics

On a desktop PC, you have several ways to close a program you no longer
need. You can usually choose File➪Exit (or something similar) from the pro-
gram’s main menu. You can click the Close button in the upper-right corner of
the program’s window. You can even press Alt+F4 when the program is in the
active window. Well, guess what? None of these options work in most iPAQ
programs. (It’s almost as though you’re never supposed to close a program
once you’ve opened it.)
As I show you in the preceding section, you can have several iPAQ programs
open at the same time, which reduces the need to close programs. It doesn’t,
however, eliminate this need. Depending on the programs that are running 
in your iPAQ, you may need to close some programs so that you can run
other ones.
Okay, if you really want to get picky about it, your iPAQ is supposed to be
able to unload programs from memory if necessary, which is the real reason
why it’s often so difficult to close iPAQ programs. Your iPAQ is supposed to
do it automatically, without your intervention. You know what? I still like to
be able to control that myself.
So how do you close an iPAQ program? You click the Start button and choose
Settings. Click the System tab and then the Memory icon. Then, click the
Running Programs tab, as shown in Figure 3-10, and select the programs you
want to close. Click the Stop button to close the selected programs or the
Stop All button to shut down all running programs. Click OK to close the
memory configuration utility.

Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Starting with Today
Your iPAQ is the perfect assistant. Not only does it perfectly keep track of
your schedule, but also quite happily gives you timely reminders without
nagging. If only humans were as easy to get along with!
The Today screen on your iPAQ shows all of your essential daily information
in one place. You see the current date and time, who owns the iPAQ (handy
when everyone just has to see that neat little gadget so that you can be sure
to get it back), any appointments on your schedule, the status of your incom-
ing and outgoing messages, and all of those tasks you need to get around to
doing one of these days.
You can select any of your Today screen items to open the item for whatever
reason — to modify the item, for example. You can also choose New from the
menu bar and then choose the type of new item to create.
Along the right edge of the menu bar, you see several icons, such as Bluetooth
and your task switcher. The number of icons varies depending on the current
status of your iPAQ, but you can click on any of the icons to access the associ-
ated settings.
To set up your iPAQ for a different time zone — handy for when you’re 
traveling — tap-and-hold the date near the top of the Today screen. See the
section “Setting the date and time,” later in this chapter, for more information.
Adjusting Your Settings
People often adjust some of the settings on their desktop PCs, so wanting to
play around a little with the settings on your iPAQ is only natural. And, of
course, your iPAQ has a different set of options than those in your desktop
system. The next few sections discuss the most common settings.
Changing your screen settings
Adjusting the screen settings on your iPAQ is easy because you have only two
screen-related settings to adjust: the brightness of the backlighting and the
amount of inactive time before the screen dims. Well, you might consider one
other setting to be screen-related — alignment. But because I consider the
alignment setting to be more closely related to improving the accuracy of
character recognition, I show you more about that one in Chapter 4.
45
Chapter 3: Understanding the iPAQ Basics

If you want to play around with color schemes and background images, see
the next section, “Using themes,” for more information.
You can access a couple of different screen settings. You may need to use
more than one of the following to get the exact combination that you like:
 Backlight brightness: To adjust the backlight brightness, tap the Start
button and choose Settings, click the System tab, and tap the Backlight
icon. Then, tap the Brightness tab. Drag the sliders to adjust the bright-
ness. You can set different levels for times when your iPAQ is running on
batteries or when it is plugged in.
 Inactive time: To set the amount of inactive time before the backlight
dims, tap the Start button and choose Settings, and then click either the
Battery Power or External Power tab — depending on which setting you
wish to adjust. Select the time from the drop-down box, and make cer-
tain the check box is selected. Keeping the time quite short before the
backlight dims is usually best, because this greatly improves the length
of time that you can use your iPAQ between battery charges.
If you select the Turn On Backlight When a Button Is Pressed or the Screen Is
Tapped check box, the backlight automatically returns to your desired set-
ting as soon as you tap the screen or press one of the buttons on the front of
your iPAQ.
If you’re going to be using your iPAQ outdoors in bright sunlight, remember
that all the iPAQs have a reflective display that’s quite visible even with the
backlight turned completely off. This setting helps you to extend your iPAQ’s
battery life to the maximum.
Using themes
If you are one of those people who really wants your iPAQ to reflect your own
personality, you’re going to love the way that you can use themes on your iPAQ.
Themes enable you to display background images on the Today screen, to
choose which items appear on the Today screen, and even to choose different
colors for the various screen elements.
Applying new themes
Your iPAQ comes with at least one theme that you can use in place of the stan-
dard theme. It’s really easy to apply a different theme. All you need to do is 
to tap the Start button, choose Settings, and then tap the Today icon on the
Personal tab. As Figure 3-11 shows, you can then select a theme from the list.
When you tap OK, the theme is applied.
46
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Downloading themes
Because custom themes can be so much fun to use, lots of people have cre-
ated themes that you can download and use on your iPAQ. Most of these
themes are free, so try out a bunch of them to find the one you like the best.
Quite a few different sites offer you themes to download. Probably the best
place to start is the Windows Mobile Example Today Themes site at www.
microsoft.com/windowsmobile/resources/downloads/pocketpc/
themes.mspx.
After you’ve downloaded some themes to try out, copy them to the Pocket_PC
My Documents folder. After you synchronize your iPAQ, the new themes will
appear in the themes list (refer to Figure 3-11).
Creating your own themes
Even though all sorts of custom themes are available for download, some-
times you can have more fun creating your own. The following are a couple of
ways to do so:
 Select the Use This Picture as the Background check box on the
Appearance tab when you are choosing a theme. Then, tap the Browse
button and select the picture you want to use.
Figure 3-11:
You can

47
Chapter 3: Understanding the iPAQ Basics

 Click the Items tab and then select the items you want to appear on the
Today screen. Deselect any items you don’t want. You can also use the
Move Up, Move Down, and Options buttons to make some additional
modifications.
The Theme Generator power toy that Microsoft had available for download in
the past is not supposed to be compatible with any of the newer iPAQ models
running Windows Mobile 2003 or later. If you attempt to create a theme using
the Theme Generator, the program generates the theme but refuses to send it
to your iPAQ. However, you can copy the theme file (it has a .tsk extension)
from your desktop PC to the My Documents folder on your iPAQ and then use
the theme as described earlier in this section. Figure 3-12 shows an example
of a theme I created with a digital image of a hummingbird at a feeder.
Adjusting your security
One of the great things about an iPAQ is that it’s small enough to fit into a
pocket. Unfortunately, this also makes an iPAQ an attractive target for thieves
or even people who simply can’t resist playing around with that neat-looking
gadget.
I can’t do much about preventing theft except warn you to be careful about
leaving your iPAQ where someone could grab it. However, I can at least show
Figure 3-12:

manually.
48
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

you how to prevent some bozo from accessing your data. That way, if nothing
else, you have the satisfaction of knowing that no thief can make use of your
personal information or files.
Enabling a password
Setting up security on your iPAQ means creating a password that must be
entered whenever the unit is turned on. Without the correct password, no
one can access your files or use your iPAQ.
Don’t depend too heavily on the simple 4 digit password option — especially
if you tend to keep very sensitive files on your iPAQ. These passwords consist
of just four numeric digits, and someone who really wants in could discover
your password just by being persistent. Sure, it may take a person several
hours, but if your information is valuable enough, a thief or a snoop may
decide it’s worth the effort.
To set a password, choose Start➪Settings. On the Personal tab, click the
Password icon. Select the Prompt If Device Unused For check box. Next,
choose the type of password you want to use, and then use the on-screen
keypad (which appears if you selected the Simple 4 Digit Password option)
or the on-screen keyboard (which appears if you selected the Strong
Alphanumeric Password option) to enter a password code, as shown in
Figure 3-13. Be sure to also tap the Hint tab and set up a clue to remind you
in case you forget your password!
Figure 3-13:

harder for

49
Chapter 3: Understanding the iPAQ Basics

If you don’t want to have to enter the password every time you turn on your
iPAQ, select the Prompt If Device Unused For option. Then enter the length of
time that you want to wait before a password is required. For example, in
Figure 3-13, the time interval is 1 hour. If you turn on your iPAQ when it has
been suspended for less than 1 hour, you don’t need to enter the password.
What to do when you forget your password
If you set a password and then forget what it is (or if someone else sets a
password on your iPAQ just to be mean), you’d better hope that you can
guess the correct password. If this doesn’t work, you’re in big trouble!
Yes, an easy way to bypass (and remove) the password does exist, but you
pay a heavy price if you use it. To forcibly remove the password so you can
again use your iPAQ, you must restore your iPAQ to the factory default set-
tings. In doing so you remove all of your data, any files you’ve created, and
any special settings you’ve applied. In other words, your iPAQ is wiped clean
of anything you’ve done.
If you’ve tried everything else and are so desperate that you feel you must
start fresh, here is the procedure you use to remove the password:
1. Remove your iPAQ from the cradle, making sure that it’s running on
the internal battery power.
2. Use the stylus to press down the recessed reset button on the back or
side of the iPAQ.
3. While the reset button is held down, press the On/Off button.
4. Release the reset button.
When you press the On/Off button again, your iPAQ turns on and all your files
are gone. To avoid repeating this major disaster in the future, you may want to
refer to Chapter 5 to see how to back up your iPAQ files on your desktop PC.
Setting the date and time
What good would an assistant be if it didn’t know the correct date and time?
If you want to be on time to your meetings and appointments, knowing the
date and time is certainly important.
In most cases, you don’t really need to adjust the date and time on your iPAQ,
because every time your iPAQ and your desktop PC synchronize, your iPAQ
asks your desktop system for the correct time. Synchronizing the date and time
makes it possible for the two of them to always know which files are newer,
and to make certain they don’t overwrite newer data with older information.
50
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Still, you can set the date and time on your iPAQ if necessary. More impor-
tantly, you can choose a different time zone so that you’re always on schedule
even when you’re traveling.
Even if you don’t travel with your iPAQ, you can make good use of the time
zone feature. Set the visiting time zone for the location of a business partner
or relative in a city in another time zone and you can quickly see the current
time at their location simply by opening the Clock Settings screen.
To access the Clock Settings screen, tap-and-hold the date in the Today
screen. You can also display this screen by clicking the Start button, choos-
ing Settings, and then clicking the Clock icon on the System tab. Figure 3-14
shows the Clock Settings screen.
After the Clock Settings screen is open, make your selections by using the
drop-down boxes. You can also click the Alarms tab if you want your iPAQ to
chirp at you at some specified time.
If you choose a time zone that’s different from the one set on your desktop
PC, your iPAQ still synchronizes the time with your desktop system, but the
times are offset by the differences between the selected time zones.

51
Chapter 3: Understanding the iPAQ Basics

Changing memory settings
Mark Twain once said, “This memory of ours stores up a perfect record of the
most useless facts and anecdotes and experiences.” In the case of the iPAQ,
the memory stores even more than that — it’s the best place to store files
when you don’t have disk drives or other offline storage.
Your iPAQ normally manages its own memory automatically. It shifts the bal-
ance between storage and program memory as needed (see Figure 3-15).
Sometimes, though, you may want to give your iPAQ just a bit of extra help.
Storage memory is that portion of the total memory in which your data and
document files are stored. Program memory is the portion of memory in
which your programs are run. If necessary, you can drag the memory slider
left or right to change the balance between the available storage and program
areas. You may, for example, need to make just a bit more space to temporar-
ily store a document that’s too large to fit into the remaining storage memory.
Your iPAQ has two types of memory. RAM (random access memory) is the
memory in which you can store data or programs that you download. This is
also in which programs are run. ROM (read-only memory) is the memory in
which your iPAQ’s operating system and built-in programs like Pocket Word
are stored. All the iPAQs use a special type of ROM known as Flash ROM, which
Figure 3-15:
iPAQ
memory
represents
a delicate
balance
between
different
needs.
52
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

can be updated by special programs. Normally you cannot add anything to
Flash ROM on your own, but as you can see in Chapter 5, you can make use
of Flash ROM to store certain types of backup information.
Aside from making temporary changes to the way memory is allocated
between storage and programs, you can make a few other adjustments to free
up more memory for other uses:
 When you click the Running Programs tab, you can choose to stop one
or more of the currently running programs. Doing so frees program
memory. Freeing up program memory allows your iPAQ to shift the bal-
ance between the two, and gives you a bit more memory to play around
with when you want to manually allocate more memory for storage.
 If you click the Remove Programs link, you can choose to uninstall some
of the extra programs you may have added to your iPAQ, freeing up stor-
age memory (and maybe some program memory if you remove a program
that is currently running). In Chapter 18, I show you how to manage your
add-on programs.
 The ultimate way to free up memory in your iPAQ is to add a storage
card — such as the SanDisk Secure Digital (SD) memory cards. Adding a
storage card enables you to place programs, documents, and even music
files into your iPAQ without using up precious built-in memory. Chapter
18 also tells you more about adding a storage card.
You can always reinstall programs from your desktop PC even if you tem-
porarily remove them from storage memory to free up some space in your
iPAQ. Just make certain that you don’t remove them from your desktop
system when you remove them from your iPAQ.
Setting your preferences
In addition to the options already mentioned in this chapter, you can adjust
several other settings to suit your own personal preferences. Most of these
settings are available through the Settings option on the Start menu. Here is a
sampling of some of the adjustable preferences that you may find useful:
 Buttons: This option lets you to specify what the buttons on the front of
your iPAQ do. You can, for example, specify that one of those buttons
opens the Media Player if you like to use your iPAQ as a personal music
player.
 Menus: This option enables you to add or remove items from your Start
menu, giving you quick access to the programs you use most often and
reducing the clutter by removing programs you seldom use.
53
Chapter 3: Understanding the iPAQ Basics

 Owner Information: Use this option to change your personal informa-
tion — such as your address and phone number if you move.
 Sounds & Notifications: This option lets you control the volume of
audio alerts and to choose which sounds are played to signal events.
 Regional Settings: Move to this option on the System tab to configure
your iPAQ for a different country.
Feel free to play around with the options — you can always change back if
you don’t like the effect created by a setting.

S
oon after you first get your iPAQ, you’re probably hit with an interesting
revelation — the darn thing doesn’t have a keyboard! Looks like tapping
out an e-mail message on this thing is going to be a whole lot of fun, doesn’t
it? (Well, okay, so one iPAQ model does have a tiny little keyboard, but it’s
still not common for most iPAQs.)
Things aren’t always quite what they seem at first glance. Getting information
into your iPAQ is one of those things that’s probably somewhat different than
what you expect, but in many ways it’s much easier than you may realize. You
may just need to adjust your thinking a little before you start having fun.
Handwriting and Your iPAQ
An iPAQ is about the same size as a small pocket-sized notepad. If you use a
notepad, you certainly know that the most natural way to put information
down in the notepad is simply to pull out a pen or pencil and start writing.
You probably hold the notepad in one hand, and write with the other. It turns
out this is also one of the best ways to enter information into your iPAQ, too.

Earlier generations of handheld PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) touted
their ability to recognize handwriting, but before the PDA got the raw power
that’s built into the iPAQ, this recognition capability was pretty much a joke.
In fact, a whole series of Doonesbury comic strips once made fun of just how
bad handwriting recognition was on the Apple Newton. Fortunately, things
have improved tremendously on the iPAQ.
Understanding the options
Handwriting recognition on an iPAQ is pretty advanced. Unless you’re one of
those doctors with handwriting that no one can read, you probably find that
your iPAQ does a pretty good job of deciphering your chicken scratchings —
especially if you choose the correct handwriting option to match your style
(and maybe practice just a little).
You can choose from the following three different methods of writing on your
iPAQ’s screen.
 Transcriber: Allows you to write pretty much like you would in a paper
notebook.
 Letter Recognizer: Provides better accuracy than the Transcriber at the
expense of input speed.
 Block Recognizer: A simpler version of the Letter Recognizer. The inclu-
sion of Block Recognizer is intended to make life easier for users who
move from a Palm PC to an iPAQ.
See the following sections for more detail on these iPAQ writing methods.
Using the Transcriber
When you use the Transcriber, you write complete words directly on your
iPAQ’s screen. The Transcriber accepts printing, cursive writing, or any com-
bination of the two.
The Transcriber has an easier time figuring out where words begin and end
when you use cursive writing because you typically write an entire word in
one continuous motion.
Figure 4-1 shows how the Transcriber works. You write a complete word and
then when you lift the stylus, the Transcriber does its best to understand
what you wrote and to convert it into text. In Figure 4-1, I’ve written Hello and
the Transcriber correctly converted it into text. I then wrote world and the
Transcriber hasn’t yet made the conversion into text.
56
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

As you complete each word, the Transcriber does the conversion into text. If
you continue to add text, your note scrolls up as necessary.
If the Transcriber stops doing an automatic handwriting-into-text conversion,
tap the hand icon just to the left of the input method selector at the lower-
right corner of the screen. When this icon has a white background, the con-
version happens automatically as soon as you complete each word. When
this icon has a gray background, you can choose Tools➪Recognize to tell the
Transcriber to convert the handwriting into text.
Transcriber also uses a series of gestures to enable you to enter things (like
pressing the Enter key by dragging straight down and then making a 90 degree
turn and dragging to the left) or to make a quick correction by simply writing
a specific character without having to stop and find the key. When you select
Transcriber as your input option, the first screen you see as Transcriber
opens shows you how to enter these special gestures. The Transcriber Help
file shows a bunch more special gestures — most of which you probably
won’t use often enough to remember.
The Transcriber is supposed to respond to a series of gestures that indicate
certain keystrokes and actions such as the Enter key, the Tab key, Undo, Copy,
Paste, and so on. For example, a motion that first moves down and then left is
supposed to be recognized as pressing the Enter key. Whether the Transcriber
actually recognizes each gesture depends pretty heavily on how accurate you
Figure 4-1:

use the
Transcriber,

one word
at a time.
57
Chapter 4: Entering Information into Your iPAQ

are at remembering and executing the correct stylus motions. If you really
want to know the set of gestures you can make on your iPAQ, tap the ques-
tion mark icon on the iconbar to open the Transcriber Help file. Then, tap
Microsoft Transcriber Gestures. Remember, though, that you must use the
stylus to enter any gestures — not one of your fingers.
To enable the Transcriber, click the up arrow in the lower-right corner of the
screen and select Transcriber. You can also choose Options at the top of the
menu that pops up from the up arrow to adjust the Transcriber’s settings.
When the Settings screen opens, click the Options button to choose from sev-
eral settings:
 On the General tab, select the Sound On check box to enable sound
effects. You may want to turn this one off if you need to work silently.
 Select the Show Intro Screen check box to redisplay the introductory
screen so that you can again see the hints about how to create the spe-
cial gestures. This is only necessary if you deselected the option to
show the introductory screen when it was displayed.
 Select the Show Iconbar check box to display a set of tools that works
with the Transcriber. For example, one tool pops up a small keyboard
that makes it easier to enter symbols such as parentheses and brackets.
Another tool adjusts the angle at which you write on the screen so that
you can write diagonally or even vertically if that’s more comfortable for
you. These tools make it easier to enter unusual characters, but they
also eat up some of your screen space.
 If you have trouble seeing what you’re writing, use the Color and Width
options to select settings that are easier to see.
 Move to the Recognizer tab and select the Add Space After check box
to have the Transcriber automatically add spaces between words. In
this mode, you don’t have to enter a special gesture whenever you finish
a word.
 If you want to enter individual characters rather than complete words,
select the Separate Letters Mode check box. Using this option may help
if you have really sloppy handwriting and the Transcriber is making a lot
of mistakes reading your writing.
Don’t select the Add Space After option if you select the Separate Letters
Mode check box — if you do, you get a space after each letter.
 Use the Speed of Recognition vs. Quality slider to improve either the
speed or the accuracy of handwriting recognition. This is one of those
delicate balancing acts where you have to decide the best setting based
on how accurately the Transcriber understands your handwriting.
 Finally, use the Recognition Start Time slider to make certain that you
have enough time to cross your t’s and dot your i’s. A shorter delay
improves the speed of recognition, but may reduce the overall accuracy.
58
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

When the Transcriber’s iconbar is showing, you can click the fourth icon
from the left (a cursive letter a) to display the Letter Shapes screen. On this
screen, you can specify how you tend to write each character. If you say 
that you never use a certain shape when writing a character, the Transcriber
doesn’t waste time trying to translate that shape into the specified character.
This can improve handwriting recognition speed, but may also lead to the
Transcriber making more errors. You just have to experiment to see what
works best for you.
If you want to adjust the angle at which you can write on the screen, tap the
arrow at the left end of the iconbar. Continue tapping the arrow until it points
upwards at the angle you prefer. You probably have to play around with this
setting to find the angle that works the best for you.
Using character recognition
If you happen to be one of those people whose handwriting is really bad — if
most of the time, even you aren’t sure what you wrote — the Transcriber may
not be such a hot idea. Spending half your time correcting transcription mis-
takes probably isn’t the best way to get much done.
Just because the Transcriber doesn’t work too well for you doesn’t mean you
have to give up on handwriting recognition, though. Your iPAQ has two other
options for understanding your handwriting — the Letter Recognizer and the
Block Recognizer.
Using the Letter Recognizer
Because it works one character at a time, the Letter Recognizer can be a
better choice than the Transcriber when it comes to understanding your
handwriting. It also uses specific areas near the bottom of the screen for dif-
ferent types of characters, so Letter Recognizer has less guessing to do than
the Transcriber. With no ambiguity about where one character ends and the
next one begins, it can be far easier to translate even sloppy handwriting into
text. Figure 4-2 shows the Letter Recognizer in action. In the figure, I just com-
pleted the letter r but haven’t lifted the stylus so the Letter Recognizer hasn’t
translated the character yet.
Another feature that helps the Letter Recognizer work is that it uses three
distinct areas to separate your input of capital letters, lowercase letters, and
numbers (plus one area where you can select special characters). Sure, it’s
more work for you because you have to select the correct area to enter differ-
ent types of characters. But because this cuts down the number of possibili-
ties that the Letter Recognizer considers, it tends to improve the accuracy. Of
course, if your handwriting is really bad, even this may not be enough. (But in
that case, you’re probably one of those people who gets lots of calls from
pharmacists asking what that prescription says, so you’re used to no one
being able to read your writing, anyway.)
59
Chapter 4: Entering Information into Your iPAQ

The Letter Recognizer claims the bottom third of your iPAQ’s screen and is
divided into the following five areas:
 The left section (under ABC) is the area where you enter letters when
you want to enter capital letters. You can enter letters as upper- or 
lowercase — they appear as uppercase in the document.
 The second section (under abc) is the area for entering lowercase letters.
Here, too, you can use upper- or lowercase, and the letters appear as
lowercase in the document.
 The third section (under 123) is where you enter numbers and symbols.
 You can enter spaces or delete characters by using the area below the
solid line.
 The right-most section has seven blocks that you can tap for special pur-
poses. The fat left arrow at the top is the one that you use the most —
it’s the backspace, which wipes out characters that weren’t recognized
correctly. Below it are arrows to move one place left or right; the Enter
key and the spacebar; and in the bottom row a help button and a button
to make entering special characters easier.

Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Writing on the iPAQ
Do you want to feel like a kid again? If so, discovering how to write on your
iPAQ may be just the ticket. Remember how frustrating it was when you drew
a picture and your kindergarten teacher didn’t see what you knew was in
the picture? At first, it may seem like you’ve gone back to those days, but
with just a little practice, you can make yourself understood by your iPAQ.
Unfortunately, writing on an iPAQ won’t make you into a better artist, but hey,
you can’t have everything!
You’ve probably noticed that two horizontal lines divide the Letter Recognizer’s
input area (see Figure 4-2). The upper line is a dashed line and the lower one
is solid. Sort of reminds you of that lined paper you had back in grade school,
doesn’t it? Actually, the lines in the Letter Recognizer do serve the same pur-
pose as those on that lined paper — they exist to show you where to write:
 The solid line is where the base of all of your characters should rest.
 The dashed line is where the top of most lowercase characters should
end. Uppercase characters should have the dashed line right about in
their middle.
 Descenders (such as j) and ascenders (such as t) should cross below
the solid line or above the dashed line, respectively.
One of the hardest things to figure out about writing on your iPAQ’s screen is
creating an entire character in a single motion. In most cases lifting the stylus
off the screen signals the end of a character — even if you weren’t done with
it. When you realize the importance of keeping the stylus on the screen until
you’re done, you find that the character recognition accuracy goes way up.
Don’t waste your time trying to go back and add more to a character you’ve
already drawn. Just wait to see if it’s recognized correctly, and if not, click the
backspace arrow. Try again, but this time, use a single motion to enter the
entire character.
If you are having trouble with the Letter Recognizer not understanding certain
characters, tap the Help button — the button with the question mark. Then,
click the Demo button and tap the character on the on-screen keyboard to
see a couple of examples of how to write the character. Figure 4-3 shows how
the letter y appears after the demo finishes drawing it two different ways.
What Figure 4-3 can’t show you is that the demo slowly draws the character
so that you can see the best way to write it. You may find that it helps to
watch the demo several times to see the correct method of drawing some of
the more difficult characters. You can also tap additional characters to con-
tinue the demo with those characters.
61
Chapter 4: Entering Information into Your iPAQ

If the on-screen keyboard disappears after you’ve seen a demo, tap the
Demo button to make it return. The keyboard then remains visible until you
click OK.
Improving accuracy
Okay, so maybe it isn’t just your handwriting. If you’ve looked at the charac-
ter input demos and have practiced until your hand is sore, but the Letter
Recognizer still doesn’t understand your handwriting, it’s possible that it
really isn’t your fault. It might just be that your iPAQ needs a bit of a tune up
in the form of a screen alignment.
Aligning your iPAQ’s screen can also improve the accuracy of how well the
unit responds to clicking on-screen items such as characters on the on-screen
keyboard.
Aligning your screen takes just a minute or so. To align, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start button and choose Settings.
2. Tap the System tab.
3. Click the Screen icon and then the Align Screen button.

4. When the large plus sign (+) appears in the middle of your screen,
press the stylus firmly into the middle of the plus sign. Press the
middle of each new plus sign that appears near the corners of the
screen.
5. When the alignment is finished, click OK.
Too bad you can’t align your car’s front end so quickly and easily!
Using the Block Recognizer
The Block Recognizer is somewhat similar to the Letter Recognizer, but
unless you’re used to using a Palm PC, you probably won’t find the Block
Recognizer to be nearly as convenient. The reason for this is simple — the
Block Recognizer emulates the Graffiti handwriting recognition found on
Palms.
For a better idea just how different the Block Recognizer is, take a look at
Figure 4-4. In the figure, I’ve run the demo to see how to enter the letter q
using the Block Recognizer. If you compare this figure with Figure 4-3, it’s
easy to see that the Letter Recognizer is probably going to be a whole lot
easier for most people to use.

Chapter 4: Entering Information into Your iPAQ

Using the Soft Keyboard
If your handwriting skills are really rusty or if you maybe just prefer typing,
your iPAQ includes an on-screen keyboard that is sometimes referred to as
the soft keyboard because it’s created by software rather than out of various
bits and pieces of plastic and metal. The on-screen keyboard is pretty darn
small, though, so you can forget any notions about touch-typing on that thing.
Using the on-screen keyboard is easy but rather slow. Tapping out your several-
hundred-page novel one key at a time with that little stylus won’t win you too
many awards for being the world’s fastest writer. Still, for short notes and the
like, it isn’t too much of an ordeal to use the on-screen keyboard.
Typing on your screen
The on-screen keyboard works pretty much like an old-fashioned typewriter.
You stab at each key to enter a character and then move on to the next one. If
you want to type an uppercase character, tap the Shift key and then the char-
acter that you want. The keyboard returns to lowercase after you tap the
character. To keep the keyboard in uppercase mode, tap the CAP key instead
of the Shift key.
To move the insertion point, use the movement keys at the right edge of the
lower row of the keyboard. You may find it easier to simply tap in the text
with your stylus to move the insertion point.
If you need to enter accented characters, tap the second key from the left in
the bottom row — the key with áü on the face. This shifts the keyboard so it
shows accented characters. You can click the same key again to return to
normal characters.
Some shortcuts to speed your typing
With a keyboard as small and awkward to use as the on-screen keyboard, you
can probably use some help by way of typing shortcuts. As Figure 4-5 shows,
the on-screen keyboard does its best to try and help you out by suggesting
words that seem to match what you’re typing. If the correct word appears in
the pop-up list, tap that word to enter it into the document without having to
finish typing the word out. One really cool feature is that your iPAQ remem-
bers words you enter often — such as your name — so that they are added to
the list of suggestions. Then, when you start typing the same word in the
future, you can select the word instead of having to retype it each time.
64
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

To control how your iPAQ suggests words as you type, tap the input selector
(the up arrow at the lower-right corner of the screen) and select Options at the
top of the menu. Then, click the Word Completion tab, as shown in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-6:

65
Chapter 4: Entering Information into Your iPAQ

In the Suggest drop-down box, select 4 as the number of words to suggest;
your iPAQ now offers four alternatives rather than just one possibility, and
you’re more likely to be able to select the word you want.
If you want to enter a bunch of numbers, don’t waste your time with the
number keys in the top row of the keyboard. Click the 123 key in the upper-
left corner to change the keyboard into a numeric keypad for faster entries.
Tap the 123 key again to return to the standard keyboard.
You can also use some of the Control key shortcuts you’re used to from your
desktop PC. For example, take a look at the following list:
 Tap Ctl and then A to select all text.
 Tap Ctl and then C to copy the text.
 Tap Ctl and then X to cut the selected text.
 Tap Ctl and then V to paste the text you copied.
 Tap Ctl and then Z to undo.
 Tap Ctl and then Q to close the current application.
 Tap Ctl and then N to begin a new document.
Using Other Ways to Input Info
Time to face the facts — if you need to enter a lot of information into a docu-
ment, there’s just no substitute for a real keyboard. But just because your
iPAQ doesn’t come with a keyboard doesn’t mean that all is lost. You have
several ways to add a real keyboard to your iPAQ, and each offers certain
advantages. The following sections look at how they can make your life a
little easier.
Belkin Wireless PDA Keyboard
If you can’t even stand the idea of trying to type with the on-screen keyboard
on your iPAQ, you may want to consider another option — a folding keyboard
such as the one made by Belkin (www.belkin.com), shown in Figure 4-7. One
of the excellent features of the Belkin Wireless PDA Keyboard is that it works
with virtually any PDA because it connects wirelessly using infrared signals. 
66
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Folding keyboards are the ultimate space saver. They fold into a compact
package that’s just a bit larger than the iPAQ itself. To use a Belkin Wireless
PDA folding keyboard, unfold it, set it on a hard flat surface, and place your
iPAQ into the stand. Then you simply begin typing.
The Belkin Wireless PDA Keyboard works best with iPAQ models that have
their IrDA port on the top rather than on the side. Although you can use this
keyboard with the h1900 series iPAQ, you have to put up with placing your
iPAQ on its side in order to properly line up the IrDA ports on your iPAQ and
on the keyboard. Although the Belkin keyboard driver software offers a land-
scape option, I’ve found that attempting to use this option locks up my iPAQ
h1935, and only a hard reset (which wipes out all of the data on the iPAQ)
allows me to use the iPAQ again.
Figure 4-7:

your iPAQ.
67
Chapter 4: Entering Information into Your iPAQ

Because a folding keyboard folds, it’s not very adept at sitting on your lap as
you type. You really need to find a place for the folding keyboard that helps
keep the keyboard flat as you type.
Using a Seiko SmartPad2 with your iPAQ
The Seiko SmartPad2 can function as a keyboard, but it’s really much more
than just another way to type on your iPAQ. Unlike a portable keyboard, the
Seiko SmartPad lets you draw on a pad of ordinary paper (with a special pen)
and then automatically transfers your drawing to your iPAQ using the
infrared port.
In addition to being a really cool way to draw on your iPAQ, the Seiko
SmartPad2 is a leather portfolio with room for your cell phone, business
cards, and your iPAQ. In addition, you can find a touch-sensitive keyboard
under the paper notepad, and its larger size makes typing far easier than
using the on-screen keyboard.
You use an included program, InkNote Manager, to organize the notes you
create with the Seiko SmartPad. You can send notes as e-mail messages and
save them in several different formats. To discover more about the Seiko
SmartPad, visit the Seiko Instruments Web site (www.siibusinessproducts.
com).
You may also want to check out the Seiko InkLink Handwriting system. This
unit functions similarly to the SmartPad2, but rather than being permanently
installed in a leather portfolio, the Seiko InkLink Handwriting system clips
onto an ordinary legal pad.
Seeing your screen Magnifico
If you haven’t already noticed the following fact, I really hate to be the one
who has to tell you this: The screen on an iPAQ is pretty small. This may
seem exceptionally harsh to you if you’re the sort of person whose arms
don’t seem to be able to hold the newspaper quite far enough away. If this
phenomenon is happening to you, it may be time to check out the Magnifico,
a Portable PDA Screen Magnifier, shown in Figure 4-8. The Magnifico has a two-
power magnifying lens that sits in front of your iPAQ to make the screen far
easier to read. It’s especially useful when combined with a folding keyboard.
68
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

The Magnifico comes in clip-on and standalone versions. You can find out
more about the different Magnifico versions at the Officeonthegogo Web site
(www.officeonthegogo.com).
A slick alternative stylus
If you have ever lost a PDA stylus, you know what a pain it can be when you
reach for the stylus and find an empty slot. That’s one reason I like to always
have an alternative stylus available. It’s even better if you have an alternative
stylus that serves more than one function.
My favorite alternative stylus is the Belkin LaserWright 3-in-1 Stylus because
it combines a pen, a stylus, and a laser pointer in an ordinary-sized ballpoint
pen case. The laser pointer is especially handy when you’re giving a presen-
tation: You can read your notes from the iPAQ and use the laser pointer to
highlight on-screen information without having to switch between a stylus
and a laser pointer.

Chapter 4: Entering Information into Your iPAQ

Printing from Your iPAQ
It’s only natural to expect that you might want to print whatever data you’ve
spent so much time and effort putting into your iPAQ, right? Well, even though
this seems like a logical expectation, there’s just one little problem — none of
the programs on your iPAQ has a Print command. In fact, no matter how much
you look for a way to print your documents directly from your iPAQ, you just
won’t find it!
The basic idea behind this lack of native printing ability on the iPAQ is that
you’re expected to print stuff from your desktop system. But what if your
desktop PC isn’t handy and you just have to print out a document? After all,
the idea behind having an iPAQ is that you can carry your computing power
along in your pocket wherever you go.
Fortunately, the solution to the printing problem is both simple and free. All
you need to do is to visit the HP Mobile Printing Web site and download the
free HP Mobile Printing for Pocket PC utility. After you have installed this
program, you can use Bluetooth, IrDA, or network connections to print your
documents. To download the utility, visit www.hp.com/go/pocketpcprint_
software.
After you install the HP Mobile Printing for Pocket PC utility, use your stylus
to press the Reset button on your iPAQ. This step is necessary to complete
the software installation.

Chapter 5
Keeping It in Sync
In This Chapter
 Getting to know synchronization
 Exchanging data with your desktop PC
 Backing up your iPAQ
T
he iPAQ is the perfect companion for a desktop PC. They can share infor-
mation seamlessly, allowing you to work on either machine and still be
assured of having the most up-to-date data that’s available. When you’re in
the office, you probably opt for the large screen and comfortable keyboard on
your desktop system. On the go, you most likely prefer the small, convenient
size of your iPAQ. There’s no reason why you can’t enjoy the best features of
both systems and still be on top of your world.
Sure, you can have just an iPAQ and no desktop PC, but somehow that seems
a bit like Laurel without Hardy, apple pie without ice cream, or maybe even
pancakes without syrup. Something is missing when one of the two partners
isn’t there.
To make the partnership work, your iPAQ and your desktop PC must exchange
data automatically. The mechanism that makes this work is synchronization.
In this chapter, I show you how to make synchronization work for you.
Understanding Synchronization
Synchronization can be defined as harmonization, organization, management,
or unification. These are some pretty fancy ways of saying that you want the
same information to exist in more than one place, and that you want that
information to be the same in all of those places. From a practical standpoint,
what this means in terms of your iPAQ is that you want to share certain files
with your desktop PC, and that you want to be able to work on those files on
whichever PC happens to be handy.

Why synchronization is important
For just a moment, I’d like you to imagine a scenario that probably isn’t too
unusual. Suppose that you keep all your personal address book listings in a
small paper notebook. Now, imagine that someone else in your house has an
address book, too. Nothing at all unusual there, right? Okay, so you’re talking
with Aunt Dee and you find out that your cousin Paige has just moved. You
write down the new information in your address book and you’re all set. But
what about that other address book? Shouldn’t it also be updated with the
corrected information? Of course it should. The problem is that there’s prob-
ably no formal system set up so that whenever someone gets new informa-
tion he or she automatically shares it with everyone else in the house.
Okay, so that example is pretty obvious. Here’s another example that may not
seem quite so self-evident. Suppose you write a report on your desktop PC
and then copy that report to your iPAQ so that you can easily take the report
along to a meeting. Just before you leave for the meeting, someone phones you
to tell you that one of the names in your report is wrong — it’s Jim Johnson,
not Jim Jensen, who’s getting that big promotion. You quickly open your word
processor and fix the error in your report, but because you’re in such a hurry,
you forget to copy the corrected report to your iPAQ. When you arrive at the
meeting and begin your presentation, do you remember that whenever the
report says Jim Jensen it really should say Jim Johnson? Or do you make the
announcement that you’re promoting the wrong guy?
72
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 
Hard resets cause sync problems
If you ever need to perform a hard reset (which
is wiping out everything in your iPAQ’s memory
by holding down the Reset button with the stylus
while you turn on the power and wait for a few
seconds) on your iPAQ, you soon discover that
ActiveSync no longer allows you to synchronize
your iPAQ with your desktop PC. The reason for
this is that you can only have one device that
uses a specific name, and after a hard reset on
your iPAQ, your desktop PC no longer recog-
nizes your iPAQ by that name. (After a hard
reset, the iPAQ’s assigned name is deleted from
its memory, but that name is still the only name
by which the iPAQ is recognized by your desk-
top PC.) To correct the problem, you can either
give your iPAQ a new name or you can use the
Delete Partnership command on the ActiveSync
File menu to remove the existing partnership
settings. After you have done so, you then have
to create a new partnership. If you have backed
up your iPAQ as described later in this chapter
in the section “Backing Up Your iPAQ Files,” you
can then restore any missing files to your iPAQ.
A hard reset is seldom necessary and should be
avoided if at all possible. Sometimes, however,
you may need to do a hard reset if your iPAQ is
so locked up that a soft reset (pressing the reset
button with the tip of the stylus) doesn’t cure the
problem. You perform a hard reset by holding
down the power button while pressing the reset
button.

These two examples are but a small sampling of the reasons why you need to
synchronize information. Fortunately, synchronizing data files between your
iPAQ and your desktop PC is a snap. And when you do synchronize, you don’t
have to worry about not having the correct information at your fingertips,
whether your fingertips are on your iPAQ or desktop PC.
Setting up partnerships
You use a program called ActiveSync to synchronize the information between
your iPAQ and your desktop PC. ActiveSync synchronizes information by cre-
ating a partnership between your iPAQ and your desktop PC. This partner-
ship has the following characteristics:
 Whenever your iPAQ and desktop PC are synchronized, changes to the
files you’ve specified are updated in both directions. This simply means
that changes on your desktop PC appear on your iPAQ, and changes on
your iPAQ also appear on your desktop PC.
 You can choose the types of items that each partnership synchronizes. If
you set up partnerships between your iPAQ and two different desktop
PCs, you synchronize the same set of files with each desktop PC.
If you set up partnerships between your iPAQ and two different desktop
PCs, you can specify only one of those partnerships for sharing e-mail
messages.
 In most cases, the partnership specifies that the synchronization hap-
pens automatically whenever the iPAQ and desktop PC connect, but you
can control exactly how each partnership synchronizes its files.
 Your desktop PC can have partnerships with more than one iPAQ, but
the default settings share the same set of files between your desktop PC
and all of the iPAQs. You can change this by creating unique iPAQ identi-
ties, as I explain later in the section “Creating unique iPAQ identities.”
Creating basic partnerships
Creating a basic partnership is one of those tasks that sounds much harder
than it really is. All you have to do is insert a CD-ROM, click a few buttons,
and you’re done. Here’s the rundown:
1. Before you connect your iPAQ to your desktop PC, get out the HP
iPAQ Pocket PC Companion CD-ROM that came with your iPAQ and
insert it into your desktop PC’s CD-ROM drive.
2. If the setup program doesn’t start automatically, click the Start button
on your desktop PC and choose Run.
The Run dialog box appears.
73
Chapter 5: Keeping It in Sync

3. In the Open text box, enter x:\setup.exe (where x is the drive letter for
your CD-ROM drive). Click OK to run the setup program.
4. Click the Next button that appears in the first screen. (It’s the blue
button.)
5. Click Start Here.
6. Select Install Outlook 2002 and then select ActiveSync 3.7.
7. Connect your iPAQ to your desktop PC.
In most cases, you do this by turning on the iPAQ and popping it into the
cradle (after you’ve plugged in the cables, of course). If you have an
iPAQ model that does not use a cradle, plug the cable into the bottom of
your iPAQ.
8. When the setup program asks if you want to establish a partnership
between your iPAQ and your desktop PC, select the Create a
Partnership radio button, and then click the Next button.
9. Keep on clicking the buttons until the setup program concludes.
Basically, you just click OK to accept the default installation options for
everything that remains.
Setting up the ActiveSync options
When ActiveSync is first installed, it’s set up to synchronize lots of different
types of items. A number of these are probably things that you don’t really
want synchronized, if for no better reason than the amount of time it takes
for ActiveSync to check the status of items that you don’t use. Rather than
continue to be frustrated every time you pop your iPAQ into the cradle, you
can change the ActiveSync settings.
To configure ActiveSync to work the way you want, follow these steps:
1. If ActiveSync hasn’t popped up into view on your desktop PC, click
the ActiveSync icon in the system tray and choose Open Microsoft
ActiveSync from the pop-up menu.
2. Choose Tools➪Options (or click the Options button) to display the
Options dialog box (see Figure 5-1).
You use this dialog box to control how ActiveSync works.
3. Go down the list of items and select those that you want to synchro-
nize or deselect those that you don’t want to synchronize.
For example, if you don’t want to share your favorite Web pages with
your iPAQ, deselect Favorites. You can always change your mind later if
you want to add or remove some items from the synchronization list.
74

4. To modify an item for even more precise control, highlight the item
and click the Settings button.
Figure 5-2 shows the settings that you can choose for synchronizing
your Calendar. Other types of items do, of course, have other options.
Click OK when you are finished making changes.

Chapter 5: Keeping It in Sync

5. Before you leave the Sync Options tab completely, make certain the
Synchronize Mobile Device Clock upon Connecting check box is
selected.
This ensures that your iPAQ and your desktop PC always agree on the
correct date and time. That they agree on this is very important; other-
wise, an older file may overwrite a newer one because ActiveSync isn’t
able to determine which file is the newest.
6. Click the Schedule tab (see Figure 5-3).
Choose the options that you prefer. The default setting in the Desktop
schedule section, Continuously, is the safest option because it ensures
that your files are always up-to-date at the moment you pop the iPAQ out
of the cradle and into your pocket. You can also choose options for syn-
chronizing with a server and for when you are connected via a wireless
connection.
7. Click the Rules tab (see Figure 5-4).
Here you can decide the rules for how the synchronization is performed.
The best advice here is this: Don’t tinker around too much. The default
settings shown in the figure really do work the best in most instances.
Messing around with the conversion settings is also just asking for
trouble.
8. Click OK to close the dialog box.

Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Creating unique iPAQ identities
One aspect of the iPAQ affects almost everyone who spends a few minutes
playing around with one — before long, you want one of your own. This isn’t
much of a problem unless several people in your family all decide they want
their own iPAQ, and you all share a desktop PC. If that’s the case, you need to
create separate identities for each iPAQ.
Be sure to create the unique iPAQ identity before you create a partnership
with your desktop PC. You can’t create a partnership with the same name as
an existing partnership.
To create a unique iPAQ identity, follow these steps:
1. On your iPAQ, click the Start button and choose Settings.
2. Tap the System tab in the Settings screen.
3. Click the About icon to display the About screen in the Settings
screen.
4. Click the Device ID tab (see Figure 5-5).
5. Enter a name for your iPAQ in the Device Name field.
Keeping Pocket_PC as a part of the name is best because ActiveSync cre-
ates a folder in your desktop PC’s My Documents folder using this name,
and then places a shortcut to the folder on the desktop.
6. Click OK when you’re finished.
Figure 5-4:

synchroniza-
tion rules.

Chapter 5: Keeping It in Sync

Because ActiveSync uses the iPAQ’s name when creating the synchronization
folder on your desktop PC, only those files that are in the folder that’s associ-
ated with a particular iPAQ are synchronized (if you have selected the
ActiveSync option to synchronize files). Because of this, you may need to
move files manually from the existing synchronization folder to the new one
if you change the device name after you’ve already set up a partnership with
your desktop system.
Exchanging Data
If your iPAQ and your desktop PC are going to be partners, they need to be
able to share your data. You wouldn’t want to have to retype everything just
because you wanted to use it on both computers. I show you how to share
information between these systems.
Using ActiveSync
You’ve already seen that you use ActiveSync to create a partnership between
your iPAQ and your desktop PC. Earlier in this chapter, in the section
“Understanding Synchronization,” I also cover how you can control which
types of information are shared. But just how does this data-exchange
process really work? Here are some important details:
Figure 5-5:

a unique

your iPAQ.
78
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

 iPAQs lack one of the important pieces of hardware that you find on every
modern desktop PC — a hard drive. This is an important difference for
reasons that you may not realize. In terms of sharing data, the lack of a
hard drive is important because your iPAQ stores data differently than
your desktop PC does. In fact, your iPAQ stores much information in a
format that your desktop PC simply cannot use.
 Because of the differences between the ways your iPAQ and your desk-
top PC store information, you can’t just copy most files between the two
systems. Rather, the files must be converted from one format to the other
as they are transferred. Likewise, they must be converted in the other
direction if you transfer them back.
 ActiveSync automatically handles the format conversions as it transfers
files, which is one reason why it can take a few minutes to move files
between your iPAQ and your desktop PC.
 Remember that ActiveSync can convert only data files. You can’t convert
your desktop PC programs to run on your iPAQ (or the other way around,
for that matter).
Synchronizing your contacts with Outlook
Most iPAQ users probably want to keep their contact list available on their
iPAQ. Because of this, sharing address book information is one of those tasks
that is virtually transparent. If you make any modifications in your Outlook
Contacts folder on your desktop PC, those same changes appear in your
iPAQ’s Contacts list the next time you synchronize your iPAQ and your desk-
top PC — assuming that you’ve specified that you want your contacts syn-
chronized, of course. And any changes that you make in your iPAQ’s Contacts
list also appear in your desktop Outlook Contacts folder.
If you don’t have Outlook installed on your desktop PC, or if your version of
Outlook is an older one, you can install Outlook 2002 from the HP iPAQ Pocket
PC Companion CD-ROM.
Figure 5-6 shows a contact record that I’ve entered into Outlook on my desk-
top PC. When I click the Save and Close button, this record is added to the
Outlook Contacts folder.
Next, I place my iPAQ in the cradle and wait for ActiveSync to do its thing. If
the only change is in one contact record, the synchronization may even go so
fast that you won’t notice anything happening. But if you open the Contacts
application on your iPAQ by tapping the Start button and choosing Contacts
from the Start menu or by tapping the Start button and choosing Programs➪
Contacts and look for the new record, it’s there, as shown in Figure 5-7.
79
Chapter 5: Keeping It in Sync

ActiveSync handles the synchronization of every Outlook-related item as
transparently as it does your contact list. So transparently, in fact, that the
same appointments appear on both your iPAQ and your desktop PC.

Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Sharing data with other 
types of applications
You use a slightly different method of sharing other, non-Outlook types of
data between your iPAQ and your desktop PC. For this, ActiveSync uses a
special folder on your desktop PC and automatically synchronizes the con-
tents of that folder with the My Documents folder on your iPAQ.
When you create a partnership between your iPAQ and your desktop PC,
ActiveSync creates a new folder on your desktop PC. This folder appears as a
subfolder in your My Documents folder. The folder is named with the device
ID of your iPAQ and the words My Documents added on the end. Your iPAQ
uses the device ID “Pocket_PC” by default, so most likely the synchronization
folder is My Documents\Pocket_PC My Documents.
If you add a memory storage card to your iPAQ, you have to create a My
Documents folder on the storage card and use it to store your files in order
for most iPAQ applications to find the files on the storage card. This does not
mean, however, that ActiveSync synchronizes the files on the storage card
with your desktop PC. Indeed, when synchronizing files, ActiveSync simply
ignores any files that are stored only on the storage card. However, as I dis-
cuss later in this chapter (in the section “Exploring Your iPAQ Files”), you can
set ActiveSync to explore the storage card.
If you select the ActiveSync option to synchronize files, any files that you place
in the Pocket_PC My Documents folder on your desktop PC automatically
convert and copy to your iPAQ. Likewise, any new or changed documents in
the My Documents folder on your iPAQ are converted and copied to your
desktop PC. Limits to this do exist, however. If a file is too large for the stor-
age space on your iPAQ, it won’t be copied to your iPAQ. Also, if ActiveSync is
unable to determine the type of the file, it may be copied without any transla-
tion. That is, the file is simply copied without trying to make it compatible
with your iPAQ. You may or may not be able to use the file on your iPAQ —
depending on how lucky you are that day.
Optional sync cables
If you carry your iPAQ between a couple of different locations and sync it with
more than one PC, you have probably noticed that you end up carrying around
a whole bunch of stuff — cables, power supply, and maybe the cradle — just
so that you can share your files and keep your iPAQ charged up. To make mat-
ters worse, if you’ve been following this routine for any length of time, you’ve
probably lost (or at least misplaced) one or more of those necessary bits
from time to time. If so, you’re going to really love the two products that I
found to reduce this clutter. Both are inexpensive but essential items for any
iPAQ user.
81
Chapter 5: Keeping It in Sync

The first is the iBIZ USB Charging/HotSync Kit. This is nothing more than a
simple cable, one end of which plugs into the port on the bottom of your
iPAQ, and the other into a USB port on your desktop or laptop PC. But unlike
the standard sync cable that came with your iPAQ, this cable also charges
your iPAQ without requiring an external power supply. As long as your USB
port is powered (virtually all are), the USB port supplies the power to charge
your iPAQ. So instead of a cable, power supply and cradle, your traveling pack
is cut down to a single cable. You can find out more about this cable at the
iBIZ Web site (www.ibizpda.com/pda_accessories/pda_chargers.html).
Belkin makes a similar cable that they call the USB Sync Charger. The Belkin
unit functions just like the iBIZ cable, but Belkin also throws in a cigarette
lighter adapter so that you can charge your iPAQ in your car when no USB
port is available. You can find out more about the Belkin products at their
Web site (catalog.belkin.com/IWCatSectionView.process?IWAction=
Load&Merchant_Id=&Section_Id=1979).
External memory card readers
Every current iPAQ model comes with an expansion slot that accepts Secure
Digital (SD) and the similar MultiMedia Card (MMC) memory cards. Most
desktop and laptop PCs lack any means of reading or writing directly to these
memory cards. This normally isn’t a problem because you can simply trans-
fer files between your iPAQ and your desktop PC with ActiveSync. Even so,
accessing those memory cards directly is a whole lot more convenient.
As I mention earlier in this chapter, many files need to be converted from
one format to another when they’re transferred between your iPAQ and your
desktop system. While this is not true of all files, you should be aware that
accessing memory cards by using a card reader does not engage ActiveSync,
so those files that do need conversion won’t be useable if you transfer them
with the card reader.
One reason that you might want to use a card reader to transfer large files
that don’t need conversion is that iPAQs use the USB 1.1 standard rather than
the newer and much faster USB 2.0 standard. The card readers that I mention
in the following two sections both use USB 2.0, and this allows them to trans-
fer files in a tiny fraction of the time required to move them through the stan-
dard iPAQ USB sync cable.
Crucial SD Card Reader
If you want a card reader that’s extremely portable, you may want to consider
getting the Crucial Hi-Speed USB SD/MMC Card Reader (www.crucial.com).
This tiny unit can plug directly into a USB port or, if your USB ports are
82
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

hidden on the back of your PC, you can use the included USB cable. This card
reader is designed specifically for SD memory cards and is barely larger than
a matchbook.
SanDisk 6-in-1 Card Reader
If you’re a gadget freak like me, you probably have a number of different
devices that use memory cards. Between iPAQs, digital cameras, video cam-
eras, and the like, you may have a collection of memory cards in several dif-
ferent formats. If so, there’s nothing quite so convenient as a card reader like
the SanDisk ImageMate 6 in 1 Reader/Writer (www.sandisk.com). With it you
can read or write to SD, MMC, Memory Stick, SmartMedia (SM), and
CompactFlash (CF) Type I/II cards. Not only that, but this handy device
allows you to transfer files directly between the different memory card for-
mats — awfully handy when you want to move digital images from your
camera into your iPAQ, for example.
The SanDisk ImageMate 6 in 1 Reader/Writer is somewhat larger than the
Crucial Hi-Speed USB SD/MMC Card Reader because it has four slots to
accommodate the different memory card formats. Even so, the SanDisk unit
is only about the size of your iPAQ.
Backing Up Your iPAQ Files
Synchronizing your files is a great way to keep your iPAQ and your desktop
PC working together, but synchronization has one big problem — it doesn’t
protect you from losing important data. It’s easy to become confused by the
process of synchronizing your files and think that somehow having the same
files on both your iPAQ and your desktop PC is the same as having a backup
of your iPAQ files. Unfortunately, synchronization doesn’t protect you
because of the following reasons:
 If you delete a synchronized file from either your iPAQ or your desktop
PC, that file is also deleted from its partner the next time you synchro-
nize your files. If you think you’ll remember to copy the file to some-
place else before synchronization and thereby protect it, good luck!
Murphy’s Law will make certain that you pop that iPAQ into the cradle
without remembering to make your copy.
 If you have to do a hard reset on your iPAQ because of a system prob-
lem, any files on your iPAQ will be lost. Isn’t it a good bet that this will
happen just before you were going to synchronize your files?
 If a synchronized file somehow becomes corrupted on either your iPAQ
or on your desktop PC, you can’t complete the synchronization until
that file is deleted. And of course, the corrupt file will almost certainly
be one that you’ve spent hours on, or one that you can’t easily re-create.
83
Chapter 5: Keeping It in Sync

Doing a backup
When you back up the files from your iPAQ, all your data files, any programs
you’ve installed, and any settings that you’ve adjusted on your iPAQ are saved
in a file on your desktop PC’s hard drive, which essentially protects the entire
investment of time that you’ve placed in your iPAQ.
The backup/restore procedure that I describe here works with all iPAQ
models. Later, in the section “Using flash memory for backup,” I describe
another option that’s available on some iPAQs.
You can choose from two different types of backups:
 Full: A full backup saves everything on your iPAQ that can be backed up.
Full backups take a little longer and use more disk space on your desk-
top PC, but because everything is backed up in one file, you don’t have
to worry about where your backed up data may be.
 Incremental: An incremental backup saves only items that are new or
have been changed since the last backup. Incremental backups are usu-
ally somewhat faster than full backups, and they generally take less disk
space. Of course, this can vary according to how much you’ve done with
your iPAQ since the last backup.
Allow plenty of time for a full backup to finish. Depending on the method that
you use to connect your iPAQ to your desktop PC and the size of the backup,
the entire process can take anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour.
To back up your iPAQ files on your desktop PC, follow these steps:
1. Make certain that your iPAQ is connected to your desktop PC.
This usually means placing it in the synchronization cradle, but you
should determine your own appropriate method.
2. Open ActiveSync on your desktop system by clicking the ActiveSync
icon in the System Tray and choosing Open Microsoft ActiveSync from
the pop-up menu.
You can skip this step if the ActiveSync window is already open on your
desktop.
3. Choose Tools➪Backup/Restore to display the Backup/Restore dialog
box (see Figure 5-8).
4. Select the radio button for the backup method that you prefer.
The first time that you do a backup, both options function the same way.
5. If you want to keep more than one full backup, click the Change button
and specify the name for the backup file in the File name text box.
84
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

If you use the default name, new full backups overwrite older ones that
use the same name.
6. Click the Back Up Now button to begin the backup.
After you click the Back Up Now button, you must leave your iPAQ alone
and connected to your desktop PC until the backup is completed. If you
remove your iPAQ from the cradle before the backup finishes, you run a
high risk of corrupting the backup file.
7. Click OK to complete the backup after you see the message telling you
that it is finished.
Restoring from your backup
Restoring your files from an existing backup replaces the files that are cur-
rently on your iPAQ with the files from the backup. If you’ve made changes on
your iPAQ since that backup, those changes will be lost after the restore.
Restoring your iPAQ files is even easier than backing them up. Here’s what
you do:
1. Make certain that your iPAQ is connected to your desktop PC, and then
open ActiveSync (if it isn’t already open) by clicking the ActiveSync
icon in the System Tray and choosing Open Microsoft ActiveSync from
the pop-up menu.
2. Choose Tools➪Backup/Restore to display the Backup/Restore 
dialog box.
3. Click the Restore tab.
Figure 5-8:
Use
Backup/
Restore to
protect 
the files on
your iPAQ.
85
Chapter 5: Keeping It in Sync

4. Click the Restore Now button to display the Proceed With Restore
dialog box.
5. Click the Restore button to confirm that you do indeed want to begin
the restore.
You can’t cancel this after the restore has begun, so don’t click this
button unless you’re absolutely sure that you’re ready to restore.
6. Wait until the restore finishes (you see a message telling you it is done)
and click OK.
Restoring takes about as long as backing up.
When you finish the restore, you’re prompted to remove your iPAQ from the
cradle, reset it, and then return it to the cradle. You may then be asked how
to resolve a number of items that need synchronization. If so, choose the
option that best suits your needs and complete the task.
An alternative to backup and restore
If you don’t care for the all-or-nothing approach that a backup and restore
offers, you may be interested in my more unofficial way to protect your iPAQ
data files. This alternate method isn’t a complete replacement for backup and
restore because it protects only the files from your iPAQ’s My Documents
folder. However, it does offer certain advantages over backup and restore. For
one thing, my unofficial method doesn’t carry quite the same risk of undoing
changes you’ve made on your iPAQ.
So what’s this unofficial method, you ask? Why, it’s so simple, you’ll probably
wonder why you didn’t think of it first. When you have important files in your
C:\My Documents\Pocket_PC My Documents folder, make a copy of them
someplace else. Create an iPAQ Backups folder somewhere on your hard disk
or copy the files to another computer or to removable storage like a CD-R
disc or Zip drive.
If you do use this method, remember that you’re responsible for making 
certain that you don’t accidentally overwrite newer files in your C:\My
Documents\Pocket_PC My Documents folder with ones from your backup
folder. Your desktop PC warns you if you try to do this by displaying a dialog
box in which you have to confirm what you really want to do, but you’re the
one who is clicking that mouse!
86
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Using flash memory for backup
Depending on the model of iPAQ that you have, you may have another backup
alternative that doesn’t depend on your desktop PC. This option is especially
attractive because you can use it at any time to protect your important docu-
ment files from accidental deletion, even if you don’t have immediate access
to your desktop system.
Certain iPAQ models enable you to store some of your important files in 
non-volatile memory. This is also known as Flash ROM (although technically
speaking, it isn’t actually read-only memory). Essentially, this feature uses
whatever space is left over in your iPAQ’s flash memory — the place where
the Windows Mobile operating system and the permanently installed pro-
grams are located. Files that you store in flash memory are protected from
being accidentally deleted.
You can tell if this option is available on your iPAQ by looking for the iPAQ
Backup application in your iPAQ’s Programs folder. Figure 5-9 shows how the
iPAQ Backup program appears when you are ready to begin your backup.
Figure 5-9:
iPAQ
Backup
enables you
to backup
files directly

87
Chapter 5: Keeping It in Sync

Using the iPAQ Backup program is very similar to using the ActiveSync
Backup procedure, so I don’t go through the steps here. Keep in mind, how-
ever, that flash memory has very limited room, so you should set the options
to conserve as much space as possible.
Exploring Your iPAQ Files
Even though your iPAQ includes File Explorer, a program that works much
like Windows Explorer does on your desktop PC, managing the files on your
iPAQ can be a little difficult. Somehow it just seems a little difficult exploring
with a stylus. Wouldn’t you like to be able to root around in the iPAQ files the
same way that you do on your desktop PC?
Well, I’ve got good news for you: ActiveSync enables you to explore your
iPAQ in your old familiar Windows Explorer on your desktop PC. Figure 5-10
shows an example of browsing the files and folders on a typical iPAQ.
To explore your iPAQ’s files and folders, click the Explore button in ActiveSync.
This opens a Windows Explorer view of your iPAQ.
Figure 5-10:

88
Part I: Introducing the iPAQ 

Although you can explore your iPAQ’s files and folders from your desktop PC,
you need to remember a few things:
 If you delete files from your iPAQ, they are completely erased. The iPAQ
has no Recycle Bin. If you aren’t sure whether you need a file, make a
backup on your desktop PC before you erase the file from your iPAQ.
 You can’t open iPAQ files or run iPAQ applications from your desktop
PC. If you try to open a file, a message box appears and tells you the
file’s properties.
 If you copy a file between your desktop PC and your iPAQ in either direc-
tion, ActiveSync checks to see if the file must be converted to a different
format. If ActiveSync offers to make a conversion, allow it to do so —
otherwise, the file may not be usable on the system to which it was
copied.
 To see the contents of a storage card, you must first open the My Pocket
PC folder. You then see the card listed as a folder named SD Card (or CF
Card on some iPAQs) under the My Pocket PC folder.
 One of the easiest ways to create new folders — like the My Documents
folder on a storage card — is through ActiveSync and Windows Explorer.

Personal

Your iPAQ

In this part . . .
Your iPAQ can help keep your personal life in order. It
can keep track of your address book, help you manage
your schedule, and act as your personal note taker. In this
part, you see how to do all this and even how you can talk
to your iPAQ without feeling silly.

In This Chapter

T
he first hand-held computer-like devices filled an interesting niche. They
weren’t very powerful. They didn’t have much memory. They couldn’t
perform a broad range of tasks. But they did make an excellent replacement
for those pocket-sized paper address books that most people kept.
The iPAQ, of course, is quite powerful, has lots of memory, and can be called
upon to handle many different types of tasks. In spite of all this, some people
don’t realize just how great the iPAQ is at replacing those handwritten address
books. After you start keeping your address book in your iPAQ, you may never
have an excuse for misplacing someone’s phone number again.
What You Can Do with Your 
Address Book
One key to getting the most out of an innovative product like an iPAQ is to
think outside the box. That is, you have to stop thinking about limits and
start thinking wildly. It’s hard to do that sometimes — especially when you’re
stuck in the rut of comparing a new product with whatever it replaced. Imagine
just how little advancement there might have been in personal transportation
if the early automobile manufacturers had thought of cars only in terms of a
replacement for a horse. You probably wouldn’t have climate control in your
new car, for one thing. Only when you realize that a car can enclose you in a
mobile, weather-tight cabin can you even begin to think about heating and
cooling the air around the passengers.

The same thing applies to thinking about how your iPAQ’s address book
(which is called Contacts) can replace your little black book. You need to
remember that the same old limitations that prevented you from doing things
with your paper address book don’t apply. You need to use your imagination
to think about ways that your iPAQ address book can be useful.
Your address book as an address book
Okay, so maybe using your iPAQ’s address book as an address book doesn’t
sound all that unusual. But consider this — when was the last time you tried
to keep a hand-written address book up-do-date? Comparing the two, the
iPAQ’s address book has lots of advantages:
 Your iPAQ address book never runs out of room for another Johnson,
Olson, or Smith. Try that with your paper notebook — especially if your
family’s name happens to be Johnson, Olson, or Smith!
 You don’t have to worry about old iPAQ address book entries getting too
faded or smudged to read.
 If someone you know happens to be like certain relatives of mine, you
don’t fill up your entire iPAQ address book changing that person’s
address listing every few months. (Yes, maybe you’d just give up on the
friend or relative if you were using a paper notebook, but with the iPAQ
address book, you still need only one record no matter how many times
someone moves.)
 Because your iPAQ can easily exchange address book information with
your desktop PC, having several copies of your address book that are all
up-to-date is far easier. If something happens to one copy, you still have
at least one more copy to bail you out. If you lose your little black book,
you may lose your only copy. (Then how would you get a date for
Saturday night?)
 Because you can use a password to restrict access to your iPAQ, you
can make certain that no one else can snoop through the listings in your
iPAQ address book. Your snoopy boss won’t have any way to know that
you’ve been in contact with that executive recruiter. See Chapter 3 for
information about using a password to control access to the information
that you have stored on your iPAQ.
 Because your iPAQ’s screen has a backlight, you can look up phone num-
bers and make calls late at night without turning on a light — a definite
advantage if all you can find is some broken-down phone booth when
you’re lost out in the boondocks. To discover how to control the back-
light on your iPAQ, see the section on screen settings in Chapter 3.
 Finally, if you add the voice recognition software that I mention in the
section “Using Voice Recognition to Manage Your Contacts” later in this
chapter, you can amaze everyone by simply talking to your iPAQ to tell it
whose record you want to see!
94
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

Your address book as an organizer
Some people are really well-organized. They’re the ones whose sock drawer
has dividers and a specific place for each pair of socks. Most of us are far less
organized, but almost anyone can benefit from a certain amount of neatness
and advance planning — as long as you don’t get too obsessed with it, that is.
If you’ve used a paper notebook to keep your address book in the past,
you’re used to having a certain amount of organization. But the static nature
of things written down on paper can also limit you to a rather narrow range
of possibilities to organize your little black book. Consider the following
options, some of which you may not have realized would be practical or even
possible:
 When you add people to your iPAQ address book, you can assign them
to categories. Some people may belong in the Personal category, some
in Business, and some may be members of my favorite organization,
Wombat Lovers Anonymous. Because your iPAQ address book gives you
the option of limiting the view to display only people who are in a spe-
cific category, just one iPAQ address book can serve the function of a
whole series of different paper notebooks.
 You can add people to more than one category in your iPAQ address
book, so you need to record their information in only one place even if
they fit several categories. If their address or phone number changes,
you have to make the correction just one time to have it correct in every
category that they belong to.
 Because you can easily create as many new categories as you like, creat-
ing special categories for one-time use is an easy task. You can, for exam-
ple, create a category that includes all the members of your book club.
Then, you can create a special category for members of the book club
who want to be notified about book signings in your area by your favorite
author. This enables you to first show just the book club members, and
then easily add the author’s fans to the special category. When you hear
about a last-minute local appearance by the author, you don’t have to
waste time trying to remember who wants to know about it — your iPAQ
address book can tell you in a flash.
Your address book as an 
electronic business card
I bet you don’t have your own contact information listed in your address
book — why would you? Well, for one very good reason — so that you can
easily exchange your information in the form of an electronic business card.
95
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Address Book

iPAQs all have an infrared (or IrDA) port built in, allowing them to send and
receive data with other infrared-equipped devices like iPAQs, most laptop
PCs, certain printers, and yes, even Palm PCs. One of the coolest ways to
exchange business cards with other iPAQ or Palm PC users is to beam your
card through the IrDA port to that other iPAQ or Palm PC. In Figure 6-1, I’ve
selected a record in the iPAQ address book and used tap-and-hold to display
the context menu. (In this case, I told my iPAQ to display my contact list
sorted by company name.) All I need to do now is aim my iPAQ at the other
device and tap Beam Contact (and the person with the other unit must per-
form the necessary steps to receive it, of course). I can also send the record
via Bluetooth if another Bluetooth-equipped device is within range.
You may want to create more than one business card for different purposes.
For example, you may not want everyone to receive all your home contact
information, or you may want to create one card for business use and a differ-
ent one for use in your position as a club’s officer.
You can send any contact record via the infrared beam. You aren’t limited to
sending just your own business card. Whichever records you send, you can
be certain that the other person gets a complete record without worrying
that he or she wrote something down incorrectly.

Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

To exchange data with a laptop PC, you may need to activate the IrDA port on
the laptop. You may also need to install ActiveSync on the laptop if it isn’t
already installed. Some laptops use special applications to control infrared file
transfers, so consult your laptop’s user manual if you’re unable to exchange
information with your iPAQ. (See Chapter 5 for more information on using
ActiveSync.)
Entering New Contacts
Even the New York City phone book is just a bunch of blank paper until it has
all the names and phone numbers printed into its pages. Your iPAQ address
book is almost as useful as that blank paper before you start adding some
contact information to it — although the blank paper may be more suitable
for some purposes (like making paper airplanes).
Doing it the old-fashioned way: 
Adding records manually
Of all the methods of adding people to your iPAQ address book, you probably
spend the most time adding records manually, which isn’t the easiest way to
add records, nor is it the quickest. But adding records manually is the one
way that’s always available, and the one that gives you the most flexibility.
You need to begin by opening the Contacts application. You can open
Contacts by pressing the appropriate button on the front of your iPAQ — if
you remember which button does this on your unit and you haven’t changed
the button assignments, that is. You can also open Contacts by clicking the
Start button and tapping Contacts.
Now you’re ready to add a new record to the list. Begin by tapping New in the
lower-left corner of the iPAQ’s screen, which opens a new blank record so that
you can add information. Figure 6-2 shows how a record looks after you’ve
added information in several of the fields.
Although the entry form shown in Figure 6-2 has so many different fields that
you’d need several screens to view all of them, you don’t have to use any of
the fields that you don’t need. In fact, when you later have a look at one of
the records in your address book, you find that your iPAQ is smart enough to
show a field only if it actually contains information. In most cases, this means
that anyone’s record can easily fit on a single screen.
97
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Address Book

When you’re done adding information, tap OK to close the new record and
add it to the address book.
To confirm that the record was added correctly, you can find and view the
record. Depending on just how many people you’ve added to your address
book, finding a record can be a bit of a pain unless you understand a few of
the tools that are available to help you out.
You can narrow your search in two ways so that you don’t have to scroll
through quite so many records in your iPAQ address book. These two ways
are by using categories or by using the alphabet bar. Figure 6-3 shows both of
them. In this case, I opened the menu so that I can select a category. I could
also tap a section of the alphabet bar to view records in a specific part of the
alphabet.
If you selected a category when you entered someone’s record, you can
narrow your search by clicking the category list (just below the Start button).
This drops down the list so that you can choose a category to view. When
you select a category, only those records that are in that category appear in
your contact list.
You can easily add your own categories. To do so, tap More at the bottom of
the category list, and then tap the Add/Delete tab. You can then add what-
ever categories you need in order to organize your list of contacts. You can
add an individual to as many categories as necessary.
Figure 6-2:
Enter
contact
information
into any of
the fields as
necessary.
98
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

Remember to select All Contacts to make the full list available again when
you’re finished searching.
In addition to selecting a category, you can also click the alphabet bar (just
above the list of records) to jump to a spot someplace in the middle of your
address records, which beats using the scrollbar to move the entire distance.
When you’ve found the record that you want, click the record to view it. As
Figure 6-4 shows, the information is condensed so that you see only those
fields with information filled in.
To quickly modify the record that you’re viewing, tap Edit on the menu bar.
This opens the record and shows all the fields — even the ones that don’t
have any information yet.
Bringing records over from your desktop
As powerful as your iPAQ may be, it was never really intended to be your
only computer. Your iPAQ makes far more sense as a partner to your desktop
PC. One area where this partnership really shines is in sharing information —
such as your address book — between your iPAQ and your desktop PC. This
sharing makes it possible for you to enter the information once and then use
it anywhere.
Figure 6-3:
Use
categories

specific
records

99
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Address Book

To share information between your desktop PC and your iPAQ, you need to
use ActiveSync — a program that comes with your iPAQ. Chapter 5 covers
the use of ActiveSync in detail, but you should know some important things
about sharing your address book information between the two types of PCs.
You need to install Outlook
You need to install Outlook 2002 (or later) on your desktop PC in order to
share contact information with your iPAQ. Outlook 2002 is included on the
iPAQ Companion CD-ROM if you don’t already have it installed on your desk-
top system.
No rule says that you have to actually use Outlook on your desktop, but
Microsoft certainly has made it clear that they would like you to do so.
Outlook is the only program that can share contact information with an iPAQ,
so keeping your address book in any application other than Outlook is going
to involve a lot of extra steps whenever you want to update the information
in your iPAQ or your desktop PC.
You need the information in Outlook 
If your contact information is currently in some program other than Outlook,
you need to import that information into Outlook before you can add the
information to your iPAQ. In Outlook, you can import information by using
the File➪Import and Export command. This starts the Import and Export
Wizard, which helps you import your data.
Figure 6-4:
Open the
record 
to verify
that the
information
you added is
really there.
100
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

You can import information from many different applications, but Outlook can
sometimes be a little picky about which file formats it accepts. I’ve noticed,
for example, that sometimes I have to try three or four different formats
before I find one that works. Unfortunately, the Import and Export Wizard
allows you to go through almost the entire process before it tells you that it
cannot import a particular file. If this happens, going back to the original
application and trying to export the data in a different format is usually the
best route.
If all else fails, see if you can export the data in delimited text format. Delimited
text format simply writes out the data as a text file with each field separated
by commas and the values enclosed in quotes. Most programs offer this as an
export option, and Outlook can easily import a delimited text file.
You need to set the Contacts option in ActiveSync
After you have the address book information in Outlook, you need to enable
sharing of contact information in ActiveSync. Choose Tools➪Options in
ActiveSync, and then select the Contacts check box. Chapter 5 covers all 
the ActiveSync options so that you can see what else you may need to do.
Beam It Over, Scotty!
By far, the coolest way to add address book information to your iPAQ is to
beam it over from another iPAQ, Pocket PC, or a Palm PC. After you see how
fun this beaming is, you’ll probably start looking for other PDA owners just
so you can have beaming sessions.
Exchanging information with the infrared beams is pretty easy once you get
the hang of it. To make it a bit easier, here’s a step-by-step approach that
works well:
1. Select the contacts that you want to beam over to the other iPAQ by
dragging the stylus across the records to highlight them.
You can select more than one contact to send.
2. Tap Tools on the menu bar.
This displays the pop-up menu shown in Figure 6-5.
3. Choose Beam Contacts to begin the transfer.
Aim the infrared ports of the two iPAQs at each other, keeping the ports
within a few inches of each other. While your iPAQ is looking for the
other iPAQ, you see the Align ports and Searching messages shown
in Figure 6-6.

102
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

4. Tell the other iPAQ to save the records: Click Yes or Save All, depend-
ing on the number of records that you sent.
When the receiving iPAQ has received the transmission, you see a
Receiving Data message on the receiving iPAQ.
If the transfer didn’t work, here are some tricks to try:
 First, try starting the transfer again. This usually resolves the problem.
 If you can’t get the transfer working after a couple of tries, make sure
that the two infrared ports really are pointing at each other. Different
brands of iPAQs hide their infrared ports in different locations.
 Make certain there’s nothing between the two iPAQs that could be block-
ing the infrared light beam. Really bright sunlight can be a problem. You
may also be holding your iPAQ with your hand over the infrared port —
but if you realize this is the problem before anyone else does, blame it
on something else.
 Blame it on some secret encryption software that prevents anyone from
stealing your data. It’s not true, but how is anyone else going to know?
Using Voice Recognition to Manage 
Your Contacts
Your iPAQ is pretty cool all by itself, but this next program that I show you
could be called the iceberg of cool! In fact, this is the program that I use when
I want to impress someone by showing them how useful and advanced the
iPAQ has become.
The software I’m talking about (and talking to) is Voice LookUp from HandHeld
Speech (www.handheldspeech.com). This amazing application enables your
iPAQ to recognize your voice so that you can look up contact records by
speaking the name that you want into the microphone. After you have some-
one’s record on-screen, placing a call to them, sending an e-mail message, or
scheduling a meeting is just another simple voice command away. You can
even use voice commands to switch to different applications on your iPAQ.
You can download a trial copy of the program from the HandHeld Speech
Web site, and register it (for just $20!) after you see how well it works. If
you’re going to add any programs to your iPAQ, this one should be at the top
of your list!
103
Chapter 6: Keeping Your Address Book

Voice LookUp is very easy to use. After you’ve downloaded and installed it,
you probably want to set up your iPAQ so that pressing one of the buttons
on your iPAQ starts the program. (The readme file that accompanies Voice
LookUp tells you exactly how to do this.) This makes it even easier for you to
use Voice LookUp because you can do so just by pressing that button.
Before you can use Voice LookUp for the first time, you need to spend a few
minutes training it to recognize your voice. To do so, tap the Enroll icon in
the Programs folder, and then spend about five minutes reading some text.
At the end of the enrollment, you can begin using the program. (However,
you should continue training it as you use the program in order to improve
the accuracy — see the user documentation included with the program for
more details.)
After the enrollment is completed and you start the program, you see the
LookUp screen. This is your starting point for using Voice LookUp.
When the LookUp screen is displayed, you see a message in the lower-left of
the screen telling you that the microphone is off. Now it’s time to have some
fun. Press the button on your iPAQ that you assigned to LookUp (or the Record
button if you didn’t assign a button) so that the microphone turns on, hold
the microphone on your iPAQ close to your mouth, and say “lookup” and the
name of someone in your contact list. (See Chapter 3 if you need a refresher
on assigning buttons.) Figure 6-7 shows the result.
Figure 6-7:
Voice
LookUp
finds and
displays
your
contacts by

104
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

After a contact record is displayed, you can easily send an e-mail or place a
phone call to that person. In Figure 6-8, I pressed the button on my iPAQ and
said “send mail” to tell Voice LookUp to start an e-mail message.
As I mention earlier, you do need to train Voice LookUp in order to improve
the accuracy. If you find that the program has displayed the wrong record,
choose the correct record from the list above the Train button and then tap
the Train button. As you continue to do this, Voice LookUp will find the cor-
rect record far more often. Tap the saveUser button to save all your training.
You should do a bit of training before you start bragging to other people
about how smart your iPAQ is, but it’s time well spent — especially after you
see the reactions on peoples’ faces when they watch your iPAQ respond to
voice commands!

Chapter 7
Taking Some Notes
In This Chapter
 Discovering some great uses for notes
 Creating notes
 Recording notes by speaking 
A
s I show you in Chapter 6, your iPAQ makes old-fashioned paper
address books seem pretty lame. Well, get ready to throw out your
paper notepads, too. Your iPAQ makes writing notes on a pad of paper seem
like the equivalent of scratching a letter out on a piece of tree bark.
If you aren’t in the habit of writing yourself notes, you may wonder why
anyone would need to use an iPAQ for note taking. If so, go ahead and skip
this chapter — but write yourself a note to remind you to come back later
when you discover that you’ve forgotten something important.
Finding Uses for Your iPAQ Notes
Notes are probably the most free-form type of document that exists. There’s
really nothing formal about all those sticky notes that people paste all over
the sides of their monitors, and no rules exist to tell you what you can or can’t
do with a note. Notes simply are the Swiss Army knife style of documents.
(Why, even using the word document to describe a note seems kind of preten-
tious, doesn’t it?)
Still, you can do lots of things with notes on your iPAQ:
 Quickly write down a Web address that you see on a TV commercial.
 Create your weekly grocery list — although you may get some funny
looks in the frozen food aisle.
 Remind yourself of the punch line to that great joke you just heard. (Just
don’t try to tell people the joke by reading it off your iPAQ’s screen —
they may laugh, but it won’t be at the joke!)

 When you wake up in the middle of the night with that idea for a new
product that’s going to make you rich, write it down in an iPAQ note. You
don’t even have to turn on a light to see the iPAQ’s screen. (However, if
you want to delete that idea about the pink elephants the next morning,
go right ahead.)
 When writing down a note just isn’t possible, you can use your iPAQ’s
recording capabilities to record a voice note, something that can be very
handy when you’re in a hurry and need to capture a thought that can’t
wait for you to write it down.
 If you use the Transcriber, your iPAQ may be able to read your handwrit-
ing better than almost anyone else. So even if your handwriting is pretty
sloppy, you can still create notes that someone can actually read. Don’t
forget to proofread it, though — the Transcriber can’t produce miracles!
(See Chapter 4 for information on how to use the Transcriber.)
Of course, you shouldn’t try to do certain things with notes on your iPAQ:
 Leaving your iPAQ taped to a friend’s door with a note telling him that
you dropped by when he wasn’t home.
 Writing ransom notes on your iPAQ.
 Using an iPAQ note to tell a bank teller that “this is a stickup.” This situa-
tion could be bad if you run out with the money but forget your iPAQ —
especially if you entered your real name and address in the owner infor-
mation screen.
Writing Yourself a Note
The iPAQ Notes application seems like a very simple program, but you may
be a little surprised to find out just how much it can really do. In addition to
being a quick way to jot down a thought, this program offers some really cool
options, such as voice notes as well as an electronic drawing pad that lets
you draw a picture right on your screen. I want to make sure that you don’t
miss many of the neatest options, so here’s a quick overview.
Choosing your note options
You can just go ahead and begin using the Notes program, but why not start
with a little detour to see whether some of the available options suit your
needs? Open the Notes program by clicking the Start button and choosing
Notes from the Start menu (or from the Programs folder if you have modified
the Start menu and removed Notes). When you see the list of existing notes
108
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

(or a blank list if you haven’t used Notes before), choose Tools➪Options to
display the Notes Options, shown in Figure 7-1. Then follow along through the
following four sections to see what these options do and which settings will
work best for you.
Selecting your entry mode
The first optional setting is the Default Mode setting. You can choose to start
new notes in Writing mode or Typing mode. As you can easily guess, these
modes refer to using handwriting or the on-screen keyboard to enter text into
your notes.
Selecting a default input mode for notes may seem odd when you can easily
select your input method using the Secondary Input Panel (SIP) selector in
the lower-right corner of your screen. In reality, though, this Notes option is
pretty cool because it enables you to select a different input mode for notes
than the one that you typically use in other types of applications.
You could, for example, choose Writing as your Notes default and leave the
on-screen keyboard selected for all other input. When you want to write out a
quick note, you don’t have to remember to first switch the input method (or
worry about losing your train of thought when you have to attend to such
details).
Figure 7-1:

109
Chapter 7: Taking Some Notes

Using the Writing mode in Notes is not quite the same thing as using the
Transcriber. When you use the Transcriber, your notes are automatically
converted into text a short time after you finish writing. When you use the
Writing mode in Notes, you need to choose Tools➪Recognize to convert your
handwriting into text.
Picking a template
You’ll probably be pleasantly surprised by the next optional setting — the
Default Template option. You may not even realize that the Notes application
uses templates.
In addition to the Blank Note template, you can select from Meeting Notes,
Memos, Phone Memos, and To Do templates. Each template is set up specifi-
cally to make taking certain types of notes easier, so selecting the correct
template can help you produce better notes with less work. Indeed, the
right template can save you a lot of trouble by making certain that you don’t
forget to write down an important piece of information — such as a phone
number so that you can return a call.
In addition to adding fields for important information that you don’t want to
forget, the templates also use quite large text in the field names so that you
can more easily see where and what you need to enter.
After you select a default template, any new notes you create use that tem-
plate until you choose a different template option. Remember to use the
Tools➪Options command to select a different template when you want to
create a different type of note.
Deciding where to save it
When you close a note that you’ve created, your iPAQ saves the note into the
storage memory area. If you have a storage card installed in your iPAQ, you
can use the Save To option to choose to save the note on the memory card
rather than in the main storage memory.
Your iPAQ uses a very efficient file storage system, which minimizes the
amount of memory that’s used to store your files. Even so, the built-in stor-
age memory is limited, and using an extra memory card can greatly enhance
your ability to save files.
Saving your notes to a storage card rather than to main memory can be espe-
cially important if you create lots of voice notes. These types of notes can
really eat up memory, especially if you select one of the higher-quality record-
ing settings. Saving your notes to the iPAQ File Store saves notes in flash
memory — a fairly limited space that is not available on all iPAQ models.
110
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

Setting the Save To location to a Secure Digital (SD) or CompactFlash (CF)
card won’t have any effect if you don’t have a storage card inserted into your
iPAQ. If you select the storage card option rather than main memory and then
swap out your storage card for a different type of device that fits into the
expansion slot, any new notes that you create are stored in main memory. If
you reinsert the storage card, it’s used again to store new notes, but existing
notes in main memory won’t automatically be moved.
Programming the Record button
Your iPAQ has a button that you can press to begin recording a voice note.
(See “Recording a Note” later in this chapter for more information.) Use the
Record Button Action setting to choose what you want to happen when you
press the button.
Some iPAQ models have a dedicated Record button. If your iPAQ lacks the
dedicated Record button, you can easily reassign one of the other buttons to
the recording function. To do so, tap the Start button, choose Settings, tap
the Personal tab, and then tap Buttons icon. Choose the button that you want
to use and then select Record as the action that you want to assign to that
button.
The Record Button Action setting controls whether your iPAQ automatically
opens the Notes application when you press the Record button. Either way,
your iPAQ records your voice note, but because other applications may not
know how to deal with the voice note, keeping the default action set to
Switch to Notes is usually best.
Starting a new note
After you know what the Notes application can do and have selected the set-
tings that you prefer, you can begin using the program with a new note. If you
haven’t started the Notes program yet, click the Start button and choose
Notes from the Start menu.
If you’ve used Notes to create other notes, you see a list of the existing notes.
Tap one of them to open it so that you can read it, edit it, or simply add more
to it. To begin a new note, choose New.
What you do next depends on the input method that you select. In most cases,
using handwriting is probably the easiest, but you have to decide what works
best for you.
111
Chapter 7: Taking Some Notes

Figure 7-2 shows a note that I began writing. Although it isn’t necessary, I
chose Tools➪Recognize after entering the first four words so that you can
see how good the iPAQ is at recognizing handwriting.
Editing your note
As good as the handwriting recognition may be, you may encounter errors
from time to time. That’s when you need to get out the red pen and begin
some serious editing. (I’m not really advocating using a red pen — it’s just
that human editors traditionally used red pens to mark their corrections in a
manuscript.)
Editing a note on your iPAQ will seem very familiar because you use the same
commands that you’ve used on your desktop PC. Figure 7-3 shows the Edit
menu in the iPAQ Notes program.
Editing a note by using the on-screen keyboard is often easier than doing so
by handwriting recognition. If, however, you’re using the Transcriber, you can
teach your iPAQ to do a better job of recognizing your handwriting by train-
ing it when it makes an error. Training consists of selecting the letter that
was incorrectly recognized and then rewriting the letter. How successful this
training is depends heavily on how patient you are; you may need to repeat
the process a number of times before the recognition improves.
Figure 7-2:

note on the

112
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

To edit your note, tap where you want to make the correction. If you want to
replace a word, drag the stylus across the word to select the word. Then type
in your correction or use the Edit menu commands as necessary. If you want
to delete the last handwriting, choose Edit➪Undo Ink.
If you’re using handwriting recognition and discover that some words are
incorrect after you choose Tools➪Recognize, select the misspelled word
and then try the Tools➪Alternates command. As Figure 7-4 shows, using the
Alternates command often saves you the trouble of manual editing. If the cor-
rect word is one of the alternates, select the correction from the list. If the
correct word isn’t shown, edit the word manually. Just make sure that you
don’t select one of the non-words that often appear in the list — they’re just
your iPAQ’s attempts at being helpful.
A picture is worth a thousand words
Sometimes showing something in a quick drawing is far easier than writing
out a long description. Even a crude map can be more understandable than
someone’s list of directions. And you don’t have to give up the ability to make
a quick drawing just because you’re taking notes on an iPAQ rather than on a
pad of paper.

Figure 7-5 shows an example of a quick map that I drew on a friend’s iPAQ to
show him how to find a campground where a bunch of friends were gather-
ing. I could have added a lot more detail and even included some written
directions, but even this crude map got him to the campground.

Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

You may be wondering how your iPAQ knows when you’ve made a drawing
rather than some really odd handwriting. The answer is simple: When you
cross three of the horizontal gridlines in a single motion, your iPAQ knows
that you are using digital ink to make a drawing. When you complete your
drawing it becomes a bitmap image within your note. (A bitmap is simply a
graphic image where each dot in the image can be modified on its own with-
out affecting the rest of the image.) You can tell this because tapping within
the drawing displays a dotted line that indicates the borders of the drawing.
Don’t tap within the drawing if it’s already selected, though. That will add a
dot to the drawing. You can tell that the drawing is selected because the
dotted line appears around a drawing when it’s selected. (To find more infor-
mation about the Transcriber and the horizontal guidelines that it uses, see
Chapter 4.)
You can expand a drawing by starting a new line within the current bound-
aries of the drawing and simply continuing the line outside those boundaries.
You can change the size of the drawing by tapping it to select it, and then
using the handles that appear along the borders to stretch or contract it.
To edit your drawing, use the Edit➪Undo Ink command, which removes ele-
ments from the drawing in the reverse of the order that they were added. But
you aren’t limited to this sequential editing mode. You can also tap an element
within the drawing to select it, and then use the Edit menu commands or drag
and drop to modify it. You can even use the tap-and-hold technique to display
a context menu for the selected element.
Recording a Note
In addition to typing, handwriting, and drawing, you’ve got another interest-
ing option for creating a note. You can record a note in your own voice — or
someone else’s if you can get a friend to talk into your iPAQ.
Voice notes are often the most convenient way to create a note because you
can record a note while you’re doing something else. You can create a voice
note even when writing is pretty much impossible, such as while riding in a
crowded bus on a very bumpy road.
Although recording voice notes on your iPAQ while you’re driving seems
mighty tempting, I don’t recommend it. Even talking into your iPAQ takes too
much concentration for this to be safe. If you absolutely have to record a
voice note while driving, try to find a safe place to pull over so that you don’t
endanger everyone else (and yourself) on the road. This warning is especially
important if you’re using one of the iPAQ models that lacks a dedicated
Record button on the side of the case.
115
Chapter 7: Taking Some Notes

How good do you want it to sound?
Remember those commercials for audio recording tape that asked, “Is it live,
or is it Memorex?” Well, no one is going to mistake a recording you make on
your iPAQ with a live voice. Quite honestly, if you really want high-fidelity
recordings, you need to look somewhere else.
The voice-recording feature on your iPAQ is somewhat lacking in audio qual-
ity for one very good reason: Storing high-quality digital sound recordings
takes up a lot of space. By choosing a lower-quality level, you greatly reduce
the amount of memory needed for your recording.
Choosing the best recording format can be a bit of a pain. Your iPAQ offers
quite a few storage settings that range all the way from about 2K for each
second of recording to about 172 kilobytes per second — a ratio of 86 to 1!
Unfortunately, the choices aren’t quite as simple as they may seem. The
smallest-sized voice setting certainly gives you the longest recording time on
a given amount of memory, but you may not be able to understand your own
voice recordings if you select that option. The largest-sized files certainly
sound better, but they waste half the space they use because they’re in
stereo format — even though you’re recording from a monaural (single chan-
nel) microphone on your iPAQ. (Both channels of the stereo recording have
exactly the same signal.)
To make matters worse, if you want to share your recording with your desk-
top system or perhaps to e-mail a voice note to someone, only some of the
recording formats are likely to be usable, depending on exactly where the
recording is played back. For example, the GSM 6.10 format — the one that
happens to produce the smallest files — isn’t playable on most desktop PCs.
And it figures that the format that produces the largest files is the one that
pretty much anyone is able to play. You’ll probably find that it takes some
trial and error to determine which recording formats are usable for other
people because their particular desktop PC may not have the ability to use
the format that you select. (For details on selecting the recording format, see
the following section, “Choosing your recording format.”)
Experiment a little before you decide on the recording format. Create a few
sample files with different formats, and then try listening to those recordings
on the different PCs and in the different applications that you’re using. That
way, you won’t have any unpleasant surprises when you actually need to
make an important recording.

Choosing your recording format
In order to find the best format for you, you may want to try out several differ-
ent ones. To select the recording format, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start button and choose Notes from the Start menu.
Make certain that you’re viewing the list of notes rather than creating a
new note. If you’re in a note, you have to close the note in order to
access the recording settings.
2. Choose Tools➪Options and then tap the Global Input Options link 
to display the Settings screen. If it isn’t already displayed, tap the
Options tab.
3. Click the down arrow on the Voice Recording Format drop-down list
box, as shown in Figure 7-6, and select the option that you prefer from
the list.
4. Click OK when you have made your selection.
Don’t waste memory selecting a stereo recording format. The equivalent
mono format works just as well and takes half as much space. Besides, your
iPAQ has only a single microphone, so a stereo recording would simply have
two identical channels.
Figure 7-6:

recording
format that
suits your
needs.
117
Chapter 7: Taking Some Notes

When you select a recording format, the frequency that’s listed is the number
of samples — little bits of data that define the sound you’re recording — per
second that are used to record the sound. But this number generally repre-
sents a figure that’s about double the highest audio frequency that’s included
in the recording. As a result, selecting a format that’s listed as 8,000 Hz effec-
tively limits the recording to sounds below 4,000 Hz. This isn’t as bad as it
sounds. Sure, a musical recording that cuts off everything above 4,000 Hz
would sound terrible, but the human voice typically doesn’t use many sounds
above about 3,000 Hz. So for a voice-only recording, you don’t gain much by
including higher frequencies.
Recording your note
The easiest way to record a note is to hold down the Record button and
begin speaking into the microphone. Continue holding down the button until
you’re done. You can also click the Record button on the recording controls
toolbar to begin a recording and click the Stop button to end the recording.
(To display this toolbar, click the icon that looks like a miniature cassette
tape on the Notes menu bar.) This second option is probably best if your
iPAQ model lacks a dedicated Record button because it does not require
you to reassign one of the other buttons.
If possible, try to make your recording in one pass. Each time you press and
release the Record button on the side of your iPAQ, you create a new record-
ing. So if you want all your thoughts to be included in a single recording, be
sure to hold the button down continuously while speaking.
Using your recording
After you make a recording, you’ll want to play it back, especially if you
selected a new recording format — you want to make sure that you can
actually understand what you recorded.
To play back your recording, tap the recording in the list of notes on the Notes
screen. If you can’t hear the recording, click the speaker icon on the right
side of the recording toolbar to display the volume control (see Figure 7-7).
Drag the slider up or down as necessary.
Understanding a recording is much easier if you listen to it with headphones
rather than trying to use the built-in speaker (especially if you’ve selected
one of the more highly compressed recording formats). Any standard stereo
headphones should work, although the small ear bud type may be the most
convenient to carry along with your iPAQ.
118
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

After you check your recording and find that it’s okay, you can use that
recording many different ways. Here are just a few ideas:
 Directions: If someone is giving you directions to someplace, ask him to
record the directions on your iPAQ so that you can play them back if you
get confused or turned around. You may want to have them record each
leg as a separate voice note so that you can repeat a single note without
listening to directions you have already completed.
 E-mail attachment: You can send a recording to someone as an e-mail
attachment, which is a great way to send someone birthday greetings —
especially if you sing “Happy Birthday” in the recording. What better
way to get someone to stop complaining that you always forget his or
her birthday?
 Document insertion: A voice note can be included in a spreadsheet or
other document. When someone is viewing the document, she can click
the recording icon in the document to hear your explanation justifying
the cost of your latest business dinner.
 Friendly blackmail: Finally, if you have a recording of your buddy telling
you he’ll eat his hat if you get that promotion, you’ll probably work extra
hard to make certain that you actually do get the new job. And won’t it
be fun passing the salt and pepper?

Chapter 8
Keeping Your Mobile Calendar
In This Chapter
 Setting up your calendar options
 Creating your pocket calendar
 Putting your to-do list in your pocket
I
bet that you’re just too busy and that managing your time seems harder
than it should be. Even if weeks were eight days long, you still wouldn’t
have enough time for everything you want to do, would you?
Your iPAQ can’t create more time, but it can help you make better use of the
time you have. Not only does the iPAQ help you organize your schedule, but
it keeps track of your to-do list — all those things that need to get done some-
time, but don’t fit neatly into a schedule. And, as an added bonus, your iPAQ
can keep you out of the doghouse by making sure that you never forget an
important personal event like a birthday or an anniversary. (That alone could
be worth whatever you have to pay for an iPAQ!)
Setting Up Your Options
When you’re dealing with something as personal as your calendar, you cer-
tainly want it to reflect your way of looking at things. Luckily, you can cus-
tomize the calendar by using the Calendar options, so you’re sure to enjoy
using it.
To begin setting the calendar options the way you want them, first open the
Calendar by clicking the Start button and choosing Calendar from the Start
menu. Alternatively, you can press the appropriate button on the front of
your iPAQ (whichever button is set up to open the calendar on your iPAQ).
Next, choose Tools➪Options, which displays the Calendar Options screen,
shown in Figure 8-1. Read on for details on each option.

Defining your week
Your first choice in the Calendar Options is defining your week — at least in
terms of how you want to use the calendar.
Depending on your needs, you can have the calendar begin each week by
showing either Sunday or Monday as the first day of the week. And you’re
stuck with choosing either Sunday or Monday, so if you’ve got one of those
strange work schedules that rotate starting days or if you always begin work
on a day other than Sunday or Monday, you’re out of luck.
Next, you can choose the number of days in your week. Okay, so we all know
that there are seven days in a week, but you can set your calendar to five, six,
or seven days. The reason for this is to allow your iPAQ to display only work-
days if you want. Setting the number of days is really a matter of personal
choice; you’re on your own in deciding what to use.
Controlling the clutter
Now get ready to decide just how cluttered you’d like your calendar to
appear. Select from the following options:
Figure 8-1:
Open the
Calendar
Options
screen to
choose your
personalized
calendar
settings.
122
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

 Show Half Hour Slots: Select this option if you want to be able to easily
tap the exact time slot for appointments that begin at half past the hour
in addition to those beginning right on the hour. Choosing to show half
hour slots makes the daily schedule take up a lot more room on the iPAQ’s
screen, so I prefer to skip this option. You can easily set the correct time
for an appointment no matter how this option is set.
 Show Week Numbers: Select this to include the week number — the
number of weeks since the first of the year — in the calendar header
when you choose the week view. Unless you really need to know the
week number for some odd reason, this option seems to serve no impor-
tant purpose other than adding more clutter to the screen.
 Use Large Font: Choose this option if your calendar display is just too
hard to read. Of course, pulling out your reading glasses is another
viable option. The larger the font, the less information the small iPAQ
screen can show and the more you need to scroll.
 Set Reminders for New Items: This option automatically creates a
reminder that pops up (and even turns your iPAQ on if necessary) to
make certain that you don’t forget your appointments. You can always
set reminders for individual calendar items, but this option makes cer-
tain that you don’t forget to do so.
If you select the Set Reminders for New Items option, you can use the two
boxes immediately below the option to determine how far in advance
you want to be notified. I prefer more notice than the default setting of
15 minutes, but you can choose whatever works best for you.
 Show Icons: Tap any of the icons to choose the ones you want to see on
your calendar. The icons (left to right) represent the following:
• Reminders
• Recurring appointments
• Notes
• Location
• Attendees
• Private
Select only those icons that really mean something important to you. Doing
this keeps your calendar listings from being crowded out by all sorts of
unnecessary icons.
123
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Mobile Calendar

Sending meeting requests
The final calendar option is the choice of how to send meeting requests. (See
“Creating a meeting” later in this chapter for more information on using this
feature.) Your choices here would generally be to use ActiveSync or to send
the requests via e-mail (this option is listed as POP3 — a type of mail server).
If you access your e-mail directly from your iPAQ by dialing in to your mail
server, you may want to select the e-mail option so that the requests go out
sooner. If you regularly synchronize your iPAQ with your desktop PC, and you
handle most of your e-mail messages through your desktop system, select
ActiveSync.
Click OK when you have finished setting your calendar options.
Setting Up Your Schedule
The iPAQ calendar is more than a pretty display of dates. By adding the items
that are on your schedule, the calendar becomes especially useful: It allows
you to plan ahead. After you’ve added your schedule, you can easily see
when you’re busy, when you have some free time, and when you can arrange
for new appointments.
Because you probably use your iPAQ as a partner to your desktop PC, you
almost certainly want to have the same list of events and appointments on
both systems. Fortunately, the software that comes with your iPAQ — specifi-
cally ActiveSync — makes keeping your two calendars up-to-date a simple
automated process. When you’ve set up the items you want to share between
your iPAQ and your desktop PC, you can synchronize your calendars by
simply popping your iPAQ into the cradle on your desk. Chapter 5 shows you
how to set up ActiveSync so that you don’t even have to think about it.
In the following sections, I cover how to set up and manage your appointments
on your iPAQ. If you sometimes manage your schedule with your desktop PC,
you’ll find that the process is very similar no matter which PC you use.
Adding an appointment
Adding a new appointment to your schedule is very easy. At least it’s easy in
terms of what you need to do on your iPAQ. Finding the time to accommodate
the items you’ve added is your problem.
124
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

Just because your iPAQ’s calendar uses the fancy term appointment for things
that you add to your schedule doesn’t mean that you can add only business-
related items to the list. Birthdays, anniversaries, dates, or anything else that
happens on a specific date or time are also fair game. Someone had to pick 
a name for the items you add to your calendar, and it just so happens that
the person chose appointment. If you’d prefer to think of these things as ren-
dezvous, prior engagements, or something else, feel free.
To add a new appointment, do one of two things:
 Open your calendar and then choose New.
 Tap-and-hold a specific date and time for the appointment, and choose
New Appointment from the pop-up menu that appears.
Either method works, but the second method offers a couple advantages and
some disadvantages:
 Advantage: Starting by selecting the date and time enables you to
quickly see if the new item is in conflict with existing items.
 Advantage: If you select a specific date and time, the New Appointment
form automatically uses that date and time as the starting point for the
item. Of course, you can easily change the date and time, but you don’t
have to if the date and time are already correct when you begin creating
the schedule item.
 Disadvantage: If you’re setting up an event that’s far off in the future,
navigating to the correct date may be a bit of a pain.
 Disadvantage: If the new item conflicts with an existing item, tapping the
time of the new item opens the existing item rather than opening a new
appointment form. Events conflict with each other if they share some of
the same date and time on your calendar. For example, an all-day event
like a birthday would conflict with a dental appointment at 10 a.m. on
the same day.
Choosing a subject
Okay, you’ve elected to create a new appointment by one of the methods
described in the preceding section. Now what? Begin by entering a subject
for the item. You can select a subject from the drop-down list, as shown in
Figure 8-2, or you can enter a new subject. In the figure, I clicked the key-
board icon near the lower-right corner to remove the on-screen keyboard so
you would have a better view of the form.
125
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Mobile Calendar

Generally, the calendar shows only the event’s subject, so picking a clear sub-
ject enables you to understand your schedule with a quick glance, even after
you’ve added a bunch of things to your calendar. If you can’t figure out an
event from looking at the calendar, you have to open the individual items 
to see what they contain. So make the subject as clear as possible for your
own sake.
Even if you pick one of the subjects from the drop-down list, you can person-
alize it by adding your own text. For example, if you select the Meet With
subject, add the name of the person that you’re meeting to the subject line.
Setting the location
After you’ve specified the subject, you can add a location for the event.
Including a location isn’t always necessary because some events simply don’t
require you to be in some particular place. A good example is if the event
that you’re adding is someone’s birthday. In that case, the location doesn’t
matter (unless you happen to be going to the birthday party, of course). You
also don’t need a location if you’re listing something like a phone call that
you need to make. The point is, you can leave this field (or any unneeded
field) blank.
Figure 8-2:
Make sure
that you pick
a subject
that’s easy
to under-
stand.
126
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

For an event like a scheduled phone call, you may want to use the location
field for the phone number that you need to call (especially if you’re calling
someone who isn’t included in your list of contacts).
The drop-down location list starts out empty. As you set up appointments,
the locations that you’ve used in the past are added to the list. Eventually
you can select locations from the drop-down list rather than always entering
them manually.
Setting the times
Now it’s time to set the times for the event. Again, as with locations, not all
appointments require a time. You don’t have to worry about times for some
all-day events like birthdays, but in most cases, you want both a starting and
an ending time.
Each item that you add to your calendar is considered to run continuously
from the specified starting time to the specified ending time. If you need to
add an event that runs during the same hours — but not all day — on several
consecutive days, you can use the Occurs field to specify a recurrence pat-
tern. See the “Setting the pattern” section later in this chapter for details on
how to do this.
To set the dates and times, tap the date or time that you want to change and
either type in the correct information or select what you want from the item
that drops down. As Figure 8-3 shows, if you tap one of the date fields, a cal-
endar drops down. If you tap a time field, a list of times appears.
When you’re viewing the drop-down calendar, shown in Figure 8-3, you can
click a date in the calendar to place that date in the field. If the date that you
want isn’t visible, use the arrows at the top of the drop-down calendar to
navigate to the correct month so that you can select the date you want.
You aren’t limited to the times shown in the time drop-down lists. If you need
to set an event for 4:11 a.m., go ahead and type in the correct time. Remember,
though, that your iPAQ automatically assumes that all events run for exactly
an hour, so you may need to specify both the starting and ending times.
Picking an event type
The iPAQ calendar recognizes two types of events: Normal and All Day.
Choose No in the All Day field for events that have a beginning and ending
time; choose Yes in the All Day field for events like birthdays that don’t have
specified beginning and ending times.
127
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Mobile Calendar

Your definition of an all-day event may differ from your iPAQ’s definition. In
the iPAQ’s definition, an event that is all day begins at midnight and ends at
the next midnight. Don’t try to use Yes in the All Day field as the event type
for things that really do have a beginning and ending time — such as a train-
ing class that lasts your entire workday. If you do use Yes, your iPAQ doesn’t
warn you if the scheduled event conflicts with other items on your schedule.
Setting the pattern
The next appointment option is the Occurs drop-down list box. Use this
option to specify events that happen more than once. For example, if you
have a regular staff meeting every Monday morning at 9 a.m., you need to set
up only one occurrence of the meeting and then specify when it repeats.
Figure 8-4 shows an example of how the Occurs drop-down list may appear
when you tap the box. Your iPAQ offers several common types of patterns to
make it easy to set up recurring events.
In addition to the options presented in the drop-down list, you can set your
own unique schedule. Just tap <Edit Pattern> and use the screens that follow
to set up the recurrence schedule. You can, for example, schedule a meeting
to run at the same time for three consecutive days or schedule a club meet-
ing on the second Saturday of each month.
Figure 8-3:
Choose 
the correct
beginning
and ending
dates and
times.
128
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

Use the fourth recurrence option — the one that specifies the same date each
year — as a reminder for annual events like birthdays and anniversaries.
Choosing a category
If you keep different types of events in your iPAQ calendar, you may want to
select categories for those events. Just tap the Categories field and select the
appropriate categories for the event. These are the same categories (Business,
Family, Holiday, and so on) that you use to organize your list of contacts. (In
case you decided to skip around, I cover categories in Chapter 6.) I also show
you more about using them with your calendar entries later in this chapter in
the section “Using categories to simplify your life.”
Creating a meeting
Your iPAQ helps you set up a meeting that you’re scheduling by sending a
message inviting each of the proposed attendees. However, you’re still
responsible for keeping everyone awake during the meeting — your iPAQ
can’t handle all the details!
Figure 8-4:
Use the
Occurs
drop-down
list to set up
events that
happen on
a regular
schedule.
129
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Mobile Calendar

To select attendees, tap the Attendees field and then select each of the people
you want to notify. Your iPAQ sends an e-mail message to each person with all
the details that you’ve included while setting up the event in your calendar.
You may be a little surprised when you try to select the potential attendees:
Only those people in your list of contacts who have an e-mail address can be
selected (which actually makes total sense because your iPAQ can’t send an
e-mail message unless it knows the correct e-mail address).
Specifying the status
Not all appointments are set in stone. Sometimes, you may want to set aside
a period of time without making an absolute commitment. This situation cer-
tainly applies in the case where someone else is trying to set up a meeting
and has asked you to set aside a couple different blocks of time while she
tries to see what works best for everyone else.
The Status drop-down box offers four different choices to handle a range of
possibilities: Free, Tentative, Busy, and Out of Office. You can probably figure
out quite easily which one fits any event you’re scheduling.
Marking it sensitive
You can specify that an appointment is a private event by selecting Private
rather than Normal in the Sensitivity drop-down list box. The only real effect
of this change is that if you choose to, you can flag private events with a little
key icon.
If you share your iPAQ calendar with Outlook on your desktop PC, you can
choose to prevent private events from appearing in a printed schedule. Use
the printing options in Outlook to control just what appears in printed ver-
sions of your calendar.
Adding some notes
Preparation is one of the keys to success. When you’re scheduling events in
your calendar, why not take an extra step to make certain that you’re pre-
pared for your appointments?
You may notice that in addition to the Appointment tab, the form you use to
create a new calendar item also has a Notes tab. You can use this tab to create
a note that’s tied to the appointment.
You can use handwriting or voice recording to create notes attached to events
exactly the same way that you use these features to create standalone notes.
If you want more help with these options, see Chapter 7.
130
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

Rescheduling an appointment
Appointments get rescheduled; it’s an irrefutable fact of life. Another meeting
may cause a conflict, someone may get sick, or you may just decide that the
day is too nice to spend stuck inside with a bunch of boring executives.
Whatever the reason, events do get moved from one time or date to another.
You can move an event from one place to another on your iPAQ’s calendar in
one of two basic ways:
 When viewing your calendar, tap-and-hold the event that you wish to
move. Choose Cut from the pop-up menu to move the item to the
Clipboard. Then, tap-and-hold the new date and time, and choose Paste
from the pop-up menu. This method is simple and straightforward, but
you do have to be careful to make certain you tap-and-hold the correct
time slot when you paste the event. But if you have to move the event
very far off in the future — say a month or so — this isn’t your best
choice because you have to navigate to the correct date and hope that
you don’t get distracted before you’re done moving the event. If you do
have to move an event quite a distance, try the next method.
 Open an appointment by tapping it, and then open the item for editing
by choosing Edit. Use the drop-down boxes to specify new starting and
ending dates and times. This method ensures that you can specify the
precise times you want without error.
Changing your view
Designing a single way of looking at a calendar that fits every need is a nearly
impossible task — especially on the small screen of an iPAQ. A view that
makes it easy to select a date six months in the future isn’t much help if
you’re also trying to juggle six different appointments for next Monday. So
rather than trying to make you use one method of looking at your calendar,
your iPAQ offers five different views. Figure 8-5 shows the Year view — you
can select any of these views for use by clicking the icons on the menu bar.
Here’s a quick look at the view options (as they appear left to right on the
menu bar):
 Agenda: Shows your upcoming appointments in a condensed list. In this
view, your appointments are shown in chronological order, two lines per
appointment.
 Day: Shows your schedule for one complete day, with time slots for each
hour of the day (or each half hour if you enabled that option). This view
is generally the most useful — especially when you need to add new
items to your schedule.
131
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Mobile Calendar

 Week: Similar to the Day view, but includes a column for each day of the
week in addition to a row for each hour. This view makes it easy to see
events that are scheduled for an entire week, but no details show. Still,
this view is useful if you need to move an appointment because you can
see an entire week’s worth of time slots.
 Month: Shows the entire month and uses a small triangle in the lower-
right corner to indicate which days have items scheduled. Use this view
when planning your schedule a couple weeks in advance.
 Year: Shows the whole year. Use this view if you’re a real long-range
planner!
Tap a date in the Month or Year view to open a Day view of the selected date.
Using categories to simplify your life
If you assigned categories to the events on your calendar, you can choose to
view only those items that fit into specified categories, letting you place busi-
ness, personal, family, organization, or any other category of events on your
calendar and still keep them separate. For example:
Figure 8-5:
Use the
view icons
to decide
how your
calendar
appears. 
132
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

 Mark birthdays as personal or family so that you don’t forget them, but
reduce the clutter by excluding this category when you’re setting up
business appointments.
 Mark your club events in their own special category. Then switch to the
agenda view and select just this one category. In this mode, you see only
the club’s activities, and you can beam them to another club member
without including the rest of your schedule. (For information on beam-
ing, see Chapter 6.)
 Choose to show only the business category when participating in a
meeting in the office. (Certainly exclude your private meetings with the
headhunter from displaying — especially when your boss wants to play
around with “that neat little gadget you’ve got there.”)
Setting reminders
Adding things to your busy schedule is only half the battle. You’ve also got to
remember to send that anniversary card, make that important phone call, or
meet that potential backer for lunch. And, to make matters worse, you’ve got
to do those things on time!
One way to make certain that you don’t forget the important details is to
have your iPAQ give you a reminder of an upcoming event. Your iPAQ does
this by default, but only 15 minutes ahead of the actual appointment.
When setting up reminders, you have three options to select:
 In the Reminder drop-down list box, select Remind Me or None. If you
choose to be reminded of an event, your iPAQ sounds an audible alarm
and pops up a message box at the specified time. If your iPAQ is off
when the reminder is due, it automatically wakes up and gives you the
reminder anyway.
 Use the Number drop-down list box in the next row down to set the
number of minutes (or other time increment) in advance of the event to
set off the reminder.
 Use the Interval drop-down list box to specify whether the reminder
should come minutes, hours, days, or weeks in advance. One really neat
aspect of your iPAQ’s reminder feature is that you don’t even have to
remember to turn on your iPAQ to get the reminder. When the reminder
time comes along, your iPAQ wakes up and chirps at you. After you get
over your annoyance at this rude interruption and take a look at the
iPAQ’s screen, you see a reminder similar to the one in Figure 8-6.
133
Chapter 8: Keeping Your Mobile Calendar

When you’re creating an appointment or other event on your schedule, be
sure that you set the reminder far enough in advance to be useful. The default
15-minute reminder probably won’t help for most items on your calendar. For
those annual events, especially ones for which you may need to send a gift or
a card, give yourself at least a week of advance notice. When the reminder
does go off, you can always reset it for a later time by using the Snooze
button on the Reminder pop-up.
Tracking Your Tasks List
Scheduling a specific time for tasks can be a real chore. How do you schedule
something that doesn’t really have a date associated with it? Still, a few tasks
have at least some relationship to your calendar.
Buying Christmas presents is a good example of how tasks can relate to your
schedule. You could start your shopping any time during the year, but you
would certainly want to complete it before December 25. That is, this is a
task that isn’t something you would necessarily schedule for a specific date,
but you would have a date by which it had better be finished.

I may be
running

to be.
134
Part II: Personal Organization with Your iPAQ 

Setting Tasks options
In the spirit of keeping things as simple as they deserve to be, your iPAQ
keeps the Tasks options to a minimum. To set the few Tasks options that do
exist, first open the Tasks application by clicking the Start button and choos-
ing Tasks from the Start menu (or from the Programs folder if Tasks does not
appear on your Start menu). Then choose Tools➪Options to display the list
of options that I describe next.
It’s pretty easy to guess what the three task options do:
 Set Reminders for New Items: Selecting this makes certain that your
iPAQ will nag you about any new tasks you add to your list until you
mark them as completed. These reminders appear on the Today screen.
 Show Start and Due Dates: This option ties tasks more closely to your
schedule by adding in a date when you should start the task and a date
when the task must be completed.
 Use Large Font: Select this option to display your tasks in large charac-
ters so that they’re harder to ignore.
Pick the blend of options that works the best for you, and then click OK to
return to the Tasks list.
If you don’t need to know the starting and due dates for your tasks, leave the
Show Start and Due Date option unchecked. When this option is selected, each
task requires an extra row on your screen — even if these dates aren’t filled in.
Adding tasks
To add yet another job to your electronic job jar, choose New on the Tasks
menu. You can also display the Entry Bar above your list of tasks by choosing
Tools➪Entry Bar.
Figure 8-7 shows a new task being created in my Tasks list. If you compare the
new Tasks form to the New Appointment form that you use to add items to
your calendar (see the section “Adding an appointment” earlier in the chap-
ter), you notice that the two forms are similar. In fact, the differences are
quite minor:
 You cannot set specific times (although you can set dates) for tasks.
 Tasks can be set to different priority levels, and your Tasks list can be
sorted to show which tasks are most important.
 You don’t have to set any dates for tasks if you don’t want to. Giving the
dog a bath can wait until you’re darn good and ready!

Chapter 8: Keeping Your Mobile Calendar

Sorting your to-do list
As your list of stuff that needs to be done grows, you should figure out which
items you can continue to put off and which ones you’re just going to have to
do. One way to do this is to sort the list. You can choose to sort your task list
by Status, Priority, Subject, Start Date, or Due Date — depending on which
order is easier for you to ignore.
The drop-down list in the upper-right corner of the Tasks screen shows the
different sorting options that you can choose. When the list is not dropped
down, the sorting option that you’ve selected replaces the words Sort By.
You can also use categories to help organize your tasks. Some good choices
may be “Yeah, right,” “Forget it,” and “Geez, do I really have to?” However,
you have to add these categories yourself. For some reason, they aren’t
default categories that you can select.

Part III
Putting Your iPAQ
to Work

In this part . . .
Your iPAQ includes several powerful yet easy-to-use
applications that are closely related to the Microsoft
Ofﬁce programs that you probably already use on your
desktop PC. In this part, you see how to use Pocket Word
to work with your Word documents. You ﬁnd out how to
use Pocket Excel to create and edit Excel spreadsheets.
You see how to use Pocket Money, Pocket Quicken, or
another useful application to keep track of your expenses
your way.

Chapter 9

In This Chapter

 Creating a document in Pocket Word
 Sharing your Pocket Word documents
 Making sure you’ve used the correct words
I
t’s pretty clear to anyone who works with words that Microsoft Word has
become the dominant player in the world of word processing. Word docu-
ments are everywhere. Now they can even be in your pocket thanks to your
iPAQ and Pocket Word.
But is Pocket Word for real? How much word processing can you actually do
on something that fits so neatly into your pocket, anyway? Well, you can do
quite a bit with Pocket Word when it comes right down to it. In this chapter, I
give you a taste of just how much fun you can have with Pocket Word.
Defining Uses for Pocket Word
Okay, I’ll be the first to admit that there aren’t too many people who are going
to write a novel on their iPAQ. Tapping out a long document character-by-
character on the on-screen keyboard isn’t likely to fit anyone’s definition of a
good time. Still, Pocket Word is a very useful addition to your iPAQ. But if you
do insist on creating long documents on your iPAQ, do yourself a favor and
check out the external keyboard options that I mention in Chapter 4.

Comparing Pocket Word 
with desktop Word
One of the most important features of Pocket Word is that it can share files
directly with the desktop versions of Word. Pocket Word can open and save
files as both Word documents and as Word templates, which means that you
can work on a document on your desktop PC, transfer it to your iPAQ, and
continue to work with that document while you’re away from your desk.
Pocket Word does have its own Pocket Word file format, but ActiveSync auto-
matically converts between Pocket Word format and desktop Word format, so
you don’t see any difference no matter how you save your files.
Even though Pocket Word works well with most of your documents, you need
to watch out for some important changes. If a Word document contains table
formatting, numbered lists, or columns, those features are lost when the doc-
ument is converted to Pocket Word format. The safest way to avoid any prob-
lems is to make certain that you don’t include these items in documents that
you intend to share between your desktop PC and your iPAQ. If you must make
documents that include these features available on your iPAQ, don’t save any
changes to the file on your iPAQ because you will be saving the file minus the
features that aren’t supported on your iPAQ, and they will be lost even when
you bring the file back to your desktop PC.
So, because Pocket Word can use desktop Word documents, how can you use
Pocket Word? Here are some ideas:
 If someone sends you a report in a Word document, you can transfer the
file to your iPAQ and read the report while you’re sitting out in the local
park during your lunch break. You may still be working, but at least you
can get a bit of fresh air for a few minutes.
 If you’ve been working on a proposal for some potential new customers,
you can keep a current copy of the proposal on your iPAQ so that you
can make last-minute changes when you find out something that could
give you an advantage over your competitors.
 You can use Pocket Word to put the finishing touches on your novel
during your daily commute to the office. Of course, this isn’t a good idea
if you’re the driver (unless you happen to sit in stopped traffic for long
periods with nothing to do).
 If necessary, you can finish working on a last-minute project at the air-
port or on the plane when you’re going on vacation. Then when you get
the chance, you can e-mail the completed document back to the office.
This may be the perfect solution if you have one of those bosses who
always finds a way to ruin your vacation by insisting that you delay your
departure to clean up the mess that he or she created.
140
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

What you can do in Pocket Word
Pocket Word has many of the features that you’ve come to expect in your
word processing software. While it doesn’t have everything that you find in
desktop Word, here are some of the important things that you can do with
Pocket Word:
 Open, view, edit, and save documents in a format that retains most the
formatting of a standard Word document — just be certain that you note
the warning in the previous section about certain formatting features
that cannot be saved on your iPAQ.
 Cut, copy, and paste just as you do on your desktop PC.
 Use any standard Windows fonts in your documents.
 Apply formatting to text.
 Use paragraph formatting to control the appearance of documents.
 Create bulleted lists.
 Search for and replace specific text in a document.
 Do an automated word count to make sure that your document is a spe-
cific length.
 Spell check your documents just as you do in Word on your desktop PC.
What you can’t do in Pocket Word
As powerful as Pocket Word may be, some features were left out of the pro-
gram in order to keep it small enough to fit the available memory. Some of
the most important of these include:
 Pocket Word lacks a grammar checker. (Many people would argue that
the grammar checker in desktop Word does such a poor job that this
may actually be a blessing in disguise.)
 Pocket Word has no thesaurus. As you discover later in this chapter,
though, an excellent alternative exists, which you can easily add yourself.
 Pocket Word doesn’t support table formatting, numbered lists, or
columns. If you save a document that contains these features into the
Pocket Word format, the features will be lost.
 Finally, the one thing that you probably miss the most in Pocket Word
is that you can’t print documents from your iPAQ unless you install a
program such as the HP Mobile Printing for Pocket PC utility (which I
discuss in Chapter 4).
141
Chapter 9: Working with Pocket Word

Writing in Pocket Word
Creating a document in Pocket Word is really very similar to creating one in
desktop Word. Sure, iPAQs and a desktop PCs have obvious physical differ-
ences, and Pocket Word lacks a few features, but after you get past those 
differences, the process is remarkably similar.
To give you a better look at Pocket Word, I’ve opened a Pocket Word docu-
ment in Figure 9-1. As the figure shows, the document clearly has retained the
formatting that was in the original.
In the following sections, I show you how to use Pocket Word to create a doc-
ument and to use the editing and formatting options to improve the docu-
ment’s appearance.
Reviewing your input options
To create a document in Pocket Word, you have many of the same options
that are available in other iPAQ applications. In case you’ve been skipping
around, here’s quick look at them.
Figure 9-1:

Word docu-
ments can

the format-
ting options

142
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

Selecting an input method
Your first and possibly most important choice in Pocket Word may be in
selecting the way that you input text. You choose the input method by using
the Pocket Word View menu. Your choices include the following options:
 Writing: Enables you to write or print directly on the iPAQ’s screen. To
change your writing into text, choose Tools➪Recognize. See Chapter 4
for more information on using handwriting to input information into
your iPAQ.
 Drawing: Enables you to draw directly on the screen. Drawings are
never converted into text; instead the drawing is saved as a bitmap
image in your document. For more about adding a drawing to a docu-
ment, refer to Chapter 7.
 Typing: Allows you to use the on-screen keyboard to enter text, one
character at a time. If you have the Word Completion option enabled,
your iPAQ can help speed your text entry by suggesting possible words
that you may be entering. See Chapter 4 for more information on the text
entry options.
 Recording: Turns your iPAQ into a voice recorder. The recording is
added to your document as a sound file as opposed to text. Recording
voice notes to include with your documents is covered in Chapter 7.
If you’ve added an alternate input device to your iPAQ (see Chapter 4), you
can make your input selection by using the Secondary Input Panel (SIP) in
the lower-right corner of the screen. It’s the up arrow that appears there.
Choosing your document view
Almost as important as your choice of input method may be your document
view option choices. These choices also appear on the View menu. Here are
your options:
 Wrap to Window: Makes the text fit within the width of the iPAQ’s
screen. Selecting this option removes the horizontal scroll bar from the
bottom of the screen and wraps the lines of text so that you don’t have
to scroll side to side to read the document. Selecting this option doesn’t
make any permanent changes to your document, so it still appears nor-
mally when you transfer it back to your desktop PC.
 Zoom: Enables you to view the text at 75, 100, 150, 200, or 300 percent of
normal size. Lower zoom percentages let you see more of the document
at one time, but can make the text harder to read. Larger zoom percent-
ages can make it far easier to input text by using handwriting.
 Toolbar: Toggles the display of the Pocket Word formatting toolbar. You
can use this toolbar to apply formatting to your text. You can also click
the icon just to the right of Tools on the menu bar (the icon has an up
and a down arrow) to toggle the display of the toolbar.
143
Chapter 9: Working with Pocket Word

Editing in Pocket Word
Even though you can write entire documents with your iPAQ and Pocket
Word, you’re far more likely to use Pocket Word to do some editing of existing
documents. Editing typically doesn’t involve nearly as much text entry as cre-
ating a new document, so the chances are pretty good that you use your iPAQ
to review and correct more often than you use it to create.
But it really doesn’t matter whether you’re creating new documents or edit-
ing existing ones — you still want good editing tools. The following sections
offer a look at the ones available in Pocket Word.
Selecting, copying, cutting, and pasting
Figure 9-2 shows the Edit menu in Pocket Word. Here you find many of your
old favorites from the Edit menu in desktop Word.
Just as on your desktop PC, commands that are gray rather than black on an
iPAQ menu are currently unavailable. For example, the Cut and Copy com-
mands can be used only after you’ve selected text.
Figure 9-2:
Use the
Edit menu
commands
to select,
cut, copy,
or paste in
your Pocket
Word
documents.
144
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

Notice that the Edit menu has a Select All command but no other commands
for selecting text or other objects in your document. You have to use the
stylus if you want to select only part of a document. You may need to prac-
tice a little to get the hang of selecting text with the stylus. To select text,
point to the beginning of the selection and then drag the stylus across the
entire set of text that you want to select. If you begin your selection on one
line and move to another line, all the text between the beginning of the selec-
tion and the current stylus position become part of the selection.
To make selecting text a bit faster, tap twice on a word to select the entire
word. Tap three times within the paragraph to select the entire paragraph.
After you’ve selected some text, use the Edit menu commands to work with
the selection. Unfortunately, you can’t use the drag-and-drop technique that
you may be used to on your desktop PC — drag-and-drop isn’t supported on
the iPAQ.
Finding and replacing text
If you never had to type out a letter on a typewriter in the olden days before
word processors became popular, you may not realize just how lucky you
really are. In those ancient times, people actually had to find their own errors
by reading through their documents word by word. To correct mistakes, you
had two basic options: You could retype the page (or pages, depending on
how lucky you were), or you could apply correction fluid (or tape) to the
error and then type over it.
Modern PCs (and this includes your iPAQ) make the whole process a lot
easier by allowing you to electronically search for and replace text within
your document. There’s no more getting any of that white paint all over your
fingers, either!
In Pocket Word, you can search for and (if necessary) replace text within
your documents using the Edit➪Find/Replace command. When you select
this command, Pocket Word displays the screen shown in Figure 9-3.
If you want to replace instances of a word or phrase, tap the Replace button
to display a second text box labeled Replace With. Use the Match Case and
Match Whole Words Only check boxes to further refine the find and replace
operation.
After you’ve entered the search phrase (and the replacement phrase if appro-
priate), tap Find to locate the next instance of the phrase. Tapping Find also
displays the Find/Replace toolbar, shown just above the menu bar in Figure 9-4.
Use this toolbar to control the find or replace process.
145

Figure 9-3:

146
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

The Find/Replace toolbar includes the following commands:
 Next: Moves on through the text to the next occurrence of the search
phrase. The currently selected text is not changed.
 Replace: First replaces the highlighted text with the replacement text
and then moves on to the next place where the search phrase is found in
the text. Replace and Replace All are only active if you select the Replace
option.
 Replace All: Replaces all instances of the search phrase with the
replacement text and closes the Find/Replace toolbar.
 X: Closes the Find/Replace toolbar without making any further changes
to the text.
Be careful if you use the Replace All option. It’s very easy to make a mistake
that could be very embarrassing. For example, if you were to decide that you
had misspelled “meat” as “meet” throughout your document and used the
Replace All command to change all instances of “meet” with “meat,” someone
may be very surprised to find out that you would like to “meat him for lunch.”
Checking your spelling
Sending out a document that’s filled with spelling errors is a bad idea —
especially if that document is going to an important customer, to your boss,
or as a cover letter along with your résumé. That’s why spell checkers were
invented.
To make certain that your Pocket Word documents use the correct spellings,
open the spell checker by choosing Tools➪Spell Check. Then, choose an
option from the pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 9-5. The word or words in
the upper section of the menu are the spell checker’s suggestions. Just
choose a word from the pop-up menu to replace the highlighted word with
that selection. You can also choose to ignore the word or add it to your per-
sonal dictionary. As Figure 9-5 shows, however, you want to be careful about
accepting the spell checker’s suggestions.
Adding the date
Your iPAQ offers lots of timesaving shortcuts. In Pocket Word, for example,
you can enter the current date into a document with just a couple quick taps,
which can be very useful if you want to add the date to a letter or if you’re
creating a log of something and need the correct date to appear in the log.
147
Chapter 9: Working with Pocket Word

To add the date to a Pocket Word document, first make certain that the inser-
tion point is in the correct location. The best way to do this is to tap where
you want the date to appear. Next, tap-and-hold and choose Insert Date from
the pop-up menu. You can also use the Tools➪Insert Date command if you
don’t like tap-and-hold.
To change the format of the dates that Pocket Word inserts into documents,
click the Start button and choose Settings to display the Settings screen. Tap
the System tab and choose the Regional Settings icon. Tap the Date tab and
select the format that you prefer from the Short Date drop-down list. Click OK
to make the change.
Counting your words
Sometimes you need to know exactly how many words a document contains.
For example, if you’re entering a 50-words-or-less contest for a trip to Hawaii,
you wouldn’t want to lose the contest simply because your entry totaled 51
words, would you?
To determine the exact number of words in your document, use the Tools➪
Word Count command. When you do, Pocket Word pops up a message box
giving you the current count. Don’t forget to send a postcard from Hawaii!

148
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

Formatting your text
One thing that separates Pocket Word from a simple text-editing program
like the iPAQ Notes program is the ability to apply formatting to your text.
Although Pocket Word doesn’t include all the formatting options that you find
in desktop Word, it does provide the options that you’re most likely to want.
Take a look at the following sections for the scoop on formatting in Pocket
Word.
Using the menus for formatting
To access the fullest set of Pocket Word text-formatting options, first select
the text that you want to format, and then choose Edit➪Format, which dis-
plays the options shown in Figure 9-6.
If the font that you want to use doesn’t appear in the Font list, copy the font
from your desktop PC to the \Windows\Fonts folder on your iPAQ by using
the ActiveSync Explore function. See Chapter 5 for more information on view-
ing your iPAQ’s files from your desktop PC.
Figure 9-6:
Choose
your text-
formatting
options on
this screen.
149
Chapter 9: Working with Pocket Word

Select the formatting options that you prefer. Any text formatting that you
apply in Pocket Word remains in the document when you transfer it to your
desktop PC.
The Pen Weight option isn’t really a text-formatting selection. You use this
option to select how thick lines are that you draw with the stylus. This option
is most useful for drawings that you may want to add to a Pocket Word docu-
ment, but it may also help some when you’re using handwriting recognition
to enter text. Your iPAQ doesn’t care about the pen weight, but you may have
an easier time writing if you choose a pen weight that’s closer to the type of
pen that you normally use for writing on paper.
Using the formatting toolbar
Some of Pocket Word’s formatting options are also available on a handy for-
matting toolbar. As Figure 9-7 shows, the formatting toolbar sits just above
the Pocket Word menu bar.
The left side of the formatting toolbar contains a button to display the
Format screen as well as three of the text-formatting options. You can apply
bold, italics, or underline by using these buttons. The middle section of the
toolbar has buttons that you can tap to select left-aligned, centered, or right-
aligned paragraph format. The right side of the toolbar has a button for creat-
ing bulleted text.
Figure 9-7:
Use the
formatting
toolbar 
to apply

options.
150
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

To display the formatting toolbar, tap the button with the up and down arrows
(just to the right of Tools on the Pocket Word menu) or choose View➪Toolbar.
The display of the toolbar setting is a toggle — each time you select it, the
toolbar appears or disappears depending on its current state.
Setting paragraph options
You can also select several paragraph format options (see Figure 9-8). To dis-
play this screen, choose Edit➪Paragraph.
You can quickly set paragraph alignment and bullets by using the formatting
toolbar.
The paragraph format options include the following options:
 Alignment: Aligns the text in the paragraph to the left, right, or center.
 Bulleted: Creates paragraphs with leading bullets — symbols like those
that appear in front of the items in this list.
 Left: Controls the distance the text is offset from the left margin.
 Right: Controls the distance the text is offset from the right margin.
Figure 9-8:
Set
paragraph
alignment
and margins
with these
options.
151
Chapter 9: Working with Pocket Word

 Special: Controls the first line of the paragraph separately from the rest
of the paragraph. Select the First Line option to indent the first line, or
select the Hanging option to outdent (move to the left) the first line of
the paragraph.
 By: Controls the distance of the first line’s indent or outdent.
When you set the various paragraph options, remember the limitations of the
iPAQ’s screen. You may not be able to see exactly how your document will
appear when you go to print simply because the iPAQ’s screen is too small.
Even so, the options that you set are saved with the document, and they
transfer with the document to your desktop PC for printing.
Saving your work
One very handy difference between an iPAQ and a desktop PC may save you
from a world of trouble: The iPAQ doesn’t have a hard drive, so everything is
always in memory. As a result, you don’t really have to save your Pocket Word
documents — they’re saved automatically when you click the OK button to
close the document. So no more worries about saying no to a Save when you
really meant yes.
However, a couple of options exist to help you control how your document is
saved.
Selecting the document format
If you want to give your document a specific name, select the location where
it is saved, or select the document type. Choose Tools➪Save Document As,
which displays the Save As screen shown in Figure 9-9.
By default, Pocket Word uses the first few words in your document as the
name of the document, something that can be really convenient or a big pain
depending on the document. If every document starts out differently, using
the first few words makes it really easy to remember which document you’re
dealing with. But if you start several documents the same way — with your
address, for example — you probably want to provide a name for each new
file by entering that name in the Name field.
Pocket Word saves all documents in the My Documents folder unless you
specify a different destination. On your desktop PC, you probably use folders
to organize your files into related projects, but this may not be necessary on
your iPAQ because you aren’t likely to keep hundreds of files on your iPAQ.
It’s your call whether you want to get fancy on this. Use the Folder drop-down
list box if you want to select a different folder.
152
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

Use the Type drop-down list box to select a different format for your file. In
most cases, just leaving the type set to Pocket Word Document is best —
allow ActiveSync to handle any necessary conversions. However, you may
want to select a different format if you intend to send the document file to
someone via e-mail. (See the section “E-mailing your document” later in this
chapter.)
If you have a storage card inserted into your iPAQ, you can use the Location
drop-down list box to choose to store the document file on the storage card
rather than in main memory. If you do choose this, remember that you won’t
be able to access the file if you remove the storage card for any reason —
until you reinsert the storage card, of course. This is especially important to
remember if you want to e-mail the file to someone and need to replace the
storage card with a modem or a digital phone card to send e-mail.
Renaming or moving your document
You can rename or move a Pocket Word file after it has been saved by choos-
ing Edit➪Rename/Move. Why the program’s developers thought people would
think to look on two different menus to save a file and to rename it is hard to
say, but they did.
Figure 9-9:
Use this
screen to
control how
your Pocket
Word
document
is saved.
153
Chapter 9: Working with Pocket Word

The Rename/Move screen offers the same options as the Save As screen
with the exception of the Type option. The same choices apply when you’re
renaming or moving a file as when you’re saving it in the first place.
Sending Your File
In most cases, you’ll probably transfer Pocket Word documents to your desk-
top PC so that you can print out whatever copies you need. But because
Pocket Word runs on your iPAQ, you also have additional options for sharing
your document.
E-mailing your document
If you have an Internet connection for your iPAQ, you can send your Pocket
Word document via e-mail, which is really handy if you need to get the file to
someone quickly.
If you’re going to e-mail your Pocket Word document to someone who is not
using an iPAQ, save the file in a format that he can open in his desktop PC’s
word processor. Usually this means saving it in one of the versions of Microsoft
Word, but you may have to choose Rich Text Document or even Plain Text
Document depending on the type of computer and word-processing software
that he’s using.
To send a Pocket Word document via e-mail, choose Tools➪Send via E-mail.
If you don’t already have your e-mail access configured, refer to Chapter 14
before trying this.
Sending your document on a light beam
For even more fun, you can send a Pocket Word document to another iPAQ
user over a light beam. Just choose Tools➪Beam Document and aim your
iPAQ’s IrDA port at the IrDA port on the other iPAQ. The iPAQ receiving the file
displays a message asking if you want to accept the file. If you haven’t beamed
documents before, you may want to have a look back at Chapter 6, in which I
show you some tips on successfully sending information via the IrDA port.
154
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

Checking Your Words
The most useful tools in any writer’s toolkit are the dictionary and thesaurus.
This is especially true when you find yourself looking for just the right word,
and you can’t quite seem to find it. Or perhaps you think that you know the
word you want to use, but are you really confident that it means exactly what
you think it does?
Figure 9-10 shows an example of the Oxford American Desk Dictionary and
Thesaurus from Handmark (www.handmark.com). Unlike the simple spell
checker in Pocket Word, the Oxford American Desk Dictionary and Thesaurus
provides the full range of entries that you would find in a printed dictionary
and thesaurus, including pronunciation, meaning, and synonyms. This is one
tool that any word lover absolutely needs.
After you have found the correct word, you can use the Edit➪Copy command
to copy that word to the Clipboard. You can then paste the word into your
document. There’s no longer any reason to massacre the language just
because you’re working on your iPAQ!

Managing Your Calculations
In This Chapter
 Finding uses for Pocket Excel
 Using your desktop spreadsheet in Pocket Excel
 Creating a spreadsheet in Pocket Excel
 Sharing your Pocket Excel spreadsheets
 Using the Calculator
I
t’s interesting to think back to the origins of the computer and realize that
its original purpose was as a giant numerical calculator. No one had any
idea that computers would one day be small enough to fit in your pocket, nor
powerful enough to display life-like multimedia productions. But with programs
like Excel and Calculator, your iPAQ does hark back to that original purpose.
You don’t have to be a mathematical whiz to find uses for Pocket Excel. In
fact, that’s one of the best things about being able to take Excel along in your
pocket — if you can fill in the blanks, Pocket Excel can crank out the numbers
you need. (Even with a powerful spreadsheet program like Pocket Excel, the
iPAQ is more often thought of for its other capabilities rather than its numeri-
cal calculating ones, but this is one feature that you don’t want to overlook.)
You’ve probably got at least one calculator buried somewhere under the
papers on your desk. Simple calculators are so common and cheap that
people give them away when you renew a magazine or walk into your bank
on free calculator day. Why would you possibly need to use your iPAQ as a
calculator?
Actually, having a calculator built into your iPAQ makes a lot of sense, if for
no better reason than your iPAQ is so useful that you probably have it with
you most of the time. As the old saying goes, “a program in the hand is worth
two on the desktop.”

Uses for Pocket Excel
To get a feel for what you can do with Pocket Excel, you first need to have an
idea of just what a spreadsheet really is. Thinking of a spreadsheet as a grid
loaded with formulas doesn’t really do it justice. I prefer to think of a spread-
sheet as a really fancy calculator that already knows how to perform hundreds
of super complex calculations on data and then present it so that we simple
humans can understand what’s going on. Or maybe it’s just all magic — you
throw in a bunch of numbers at one end, and a bunch of supposedly mean-
ingful numbers fall out of the other end.
So what can you do with Pocket Excel? Here are just a few ideas to get you
thinking:
 If you work in real estate, you can create a Pocket Excel spreadsheet that
takes into account the tax implications of mortgage payments, real estate
taxes, and so on to convince your customers they can afford a higher-
priced home to help you earn larger commissions.
 If you’re an amateur astronomer, you can use a Pocket Excel spreadsheet
to calculate the altitude of satellites that pass overhead. And because
your iPAQ’s screen has a backlight that you can easily adjust, you can use
the spreadsheet when you’re out looking at the sky on a dark night, too.
 A contractor can use a Pocket Excel spreadsheet to give a customer a
preliminary idea of the cost of a project on the spot. Many people have
no idea what it costs to build things, so being able to name your price
may help you weed out the lookers from the doers without going through
the entire bidding process.
 A Pocket Excel spreadsheet can help you work on your company’s
budget while you’re commuting between home and the office. You can
actually get a chance to play around with some of the numbers without
being interrupted by telephones or that lousy background music that
your employees insist on playing.
 If you bet on the horses, a Pocket Excel spreadsheet can help you figure
out which ones you want to put your money on based on the statistics
and records you’ve entered. Of course, there’s no guarantee that you’ve
got the right formula to produce winners, but that’s part of the fun of
going to the races, isn’t it? Remember; just keep telling yourself, “It’s
only money.”
 Of course, anyone who keeps a household budget knows how handy a
calculator is. Think of how much handier it would be to use a Pocket
Excel spreadsheet so that you can always look back at your numbers to
make certain that you didn’t mess things up by accidentally entering the
wrong number for something.

Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

Transferring Your Desktop Spreadsheet
Your iPAQ may be a great tool for using a Pocket Excel spreadsheet, but no
one is going to suggest that it’s a great tool for creating one. Sure, you can do
it, but do you want to? Transferring an Excel spreadsheet from your desktop
PC is much easier than creating some complex monster from scratch right on
your iPAQ. Entering complex formulas by using the iPAQ’s on-screen keyboard
just isn’t going to rank very high up on your list of fun things to do!
Transferring an Excel spreadsheet to your iPAQ takes just a few moments.
As I discuss in Chapter 5, when you copy your Excel spreadsheet file into the
Pocket_PC My Documents folder on your desktop PC, ActiveSync takes care
of the transfer the next time you pop the iPAQ into the synchronization
cradle.
Figure 10-1 shows an Excel spreadsheet that I copied from my desktop PC to
my iPAQ. In this case, the spreadsheet is one that I created to quickly figure
out the day of the week for any date.

Chapter 10: Managing Your Calculations

Excel Features Not Included 
in Pocket Excel
Of course, some differences do exist between Excel on your desktop PC and
Pocket Excel on your iPAQ. Read on for a look at a few important differences.
Macros need not apply
Many years ago, the user manual for Lotus 1-2-3, the first spreadsheet pro-
gram that became popular on the PC, asked the readers if they really wanted
to become a programmer. This question lead in to a short description of the
macro commands that one could use to automate certain operations in the
spreadsheet. (Macros are really just a simple programming language built
into many different types of application programs.) Over the years, macros
became almost an institution with some users, and spreadsheet automation
was the sign of a true spreadsheet guru.
As popular as macros and other programming languages were, however, 
they were also complex and allowed users to create spreadsheets that no 
one could really understand. You still see some of those monsters on occa-
sion, but macros aren’t nearly the rage they once were, which is a good thing
if you want to use your spreadsheet in Pocket Excel on your iPAQ — macros
simply don’t work in Pocket Excel.
You don’t have to worry about macro viruses in your Pocket Excel spread-
sheets, either. Because macros can’t run on Pocket Excel, macro viruses can’t
run either.
Forget the graphs, just give me the facts
Graphs are another of those spreadsheet features that don’t make it across
the line from desktop Excel to Pocket Excel. But how many really useful
graphs have you ever seen in a spreadsheet anyway? Sure, a graph may seem
to be saying something impressive, but don’t you often get the impression
that people use graphs simply because they can, not because they really
mean anything to anyone?
160
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

Functioning in a Pocket Excel world
Functions are the meat and potatoes of spreadsheets. Functions are the built-
in formulas that enable you to perform all sorts of fancy calculations that
would take a year or three to do on your own.
Pocket Excel has over 100 built-in functions. If you need to calculate “the
depreciation of an asset for a specified period using the double-declining bal-
ance method,” Pocket Excel has a built-in function to do it. Just don’t ask me
to explain what the double-declining balance method is — I haven’t got a clue.
But if you need it, it’s there waiting for you to insert some numbers and act
like you really do know what it means. (For more on actually using functions,
see the “Entering formulas” section later in this chapter.)
As bizarre as it may sound, the 100-plus built-in functions in Pocket Excel
don’t come close to the mind-boggling 400-plus functions in some desktop
spreadsheets. For example, unlike desktop Excel, Pocket Excel can’t calculate
the “cumulative beta probability density function” — whatever that is.
In reality, unless you’re really doing strange things with spreadsheets, Pocket
Excel probably has all the functions you’ll ever need. If it doesn’t, maybe you
need to get out into the fresh air a bit more often.
Creating a Pocket Spreadsheet
Okay, I admit that earlier in this Chapter I say that the iPAQ isn’t the greatest
tool for creating a spreadsheet. Your desktop PC’s larger screen and more
convenient means of input certainly make creating spreadsheets far less of
an ordeal than it can be on an iPAQ. Still, knowing how to create or modify a
Pocket Excel spreadsheet on your iPAQ does provide you with the ability to
create a spreadsheet when no desktop PC is available. Besides, anyone who
watches you create a spreadsheet with a stylus is going to know that you’re
not someone to mess with!
So, just what does it take to create or modify a spreadsheet on your iPAQ?
Besides lots of patience, it takes using the tools in Pocket Excel. The follow-
ing sections show the tools that you most likely need.
161
Chapter 10: Managing Your Calculations

Entering formulas
Pocket Excel uses the same format for formulas that you’re familiar with from
Excel on your desktop PC. You begin a formula by entering an equal sign (=).
(If you forget to lead off with the equal sign, Pocket Excel doesn’t realize that
you are attempting to enter a formula.) Then, reference the spreadsheet cells
that you want to include in the formula. For example, if you want to sum the
values from cells A1 through A4, and you want that sum to appear in cell A5,
you enter the formula as =A1+A2+A3+A4 in cell A5. Figure 10-2 shows how
this formula appears in the spreadsheet. When you enter a formula in a Pocket
Excel spreadsheet, the value appears in the spreadsheet, and the formula
appears just above the columns when the cell is selected.
You can enter a formula that references the values in specific cells by tapping
those cells just the way you click cells when you use Excel on your desktop PC.
Entering formulas by using arithmetic operators like the plus sign (+) and
minus sign (–) is fine for very simple calculations, but to get real power in
your formulas, use some of those built-in functions that I mention earlier, in
the section “Functioning in a Pocket Excel world.” For example, use the SUM
function rather than a series of plus signs to sum up a column of 100 different
numbers. To insert a function, select it from the scrolling list of functions and
click OK. You can select from the list by tapping the fx button to the left of
the formula bar after you enter an equal sign to begin the formula.
Figure 10-2:
Here’s how

sheet.
162
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

Click the 123 button on the on-screen keyboard. This changes the keyboard
to the numeric keypad and makes numerical entries somewhat easier.
I don’t have the space here to describe all of Pocket Excel’s built-in functions.
For that detailed information, refer to a book such as my Excel 2002 Bible or
one of the other fine titles from Wiley Publishing, Inc., that cover Excel in
more depth. However, I can at least show you how to add those functions to
your Pocket Excel spreadsheet. To do so, choose Tools➪Insert Function from
the Pocket Excel menu bar, which displays the Insert Function screen shown
in Figure 10-3.
If you’re not sure which Pocket Excel function you need, use the Category list
to cut down the number of functions that are displayed by showing only func-
tions that apply to a specific category. Then, watch the description area below
the list of functions. As you highlight a function, the description area provides
you with some idea of what the function does.
One problem with using functions is that nearly all of them require 
arguments — extra information (such as cell references or values) that you
must enter in order to complete the calculation. This doesn’t mean that the
functions are angry, but even so, you may become frustrated trying to figure
out what information is required for each argument — especially when you
try to use some of the stranger functions that are available in Pocket Excel.
Figure 10-3:
Use this
screen 
to choose
from Pocket
Excel’s built-
in functions.
163
Chapter 10: Managing Your Calculations

When you select a function to add to your spreadsheet, Pocket Excel includes
placeholders (names that describe what is needed) for each argument. You
have to determine the correct information to replace each of the placeholders.
Some of the argument placeholders are easy to understand, such as the year,
month, and day values that are required for the DATE function. Other argu-
ment placeholders — such as “number,” which appears in many functions —
are far less clear.
The copy of Excel on your desktop PC includes far more help than simple
argument placeholders for entering functions into spreadsheets. I recom-
mend checking the desktop version of Excel if you need more help figuring
out what information to enter for each of the arguments in complex func-
tions. Or you could turn to the Excel 2002 Bible that I mention earlier.
Editing your spreadsheet
We’ve all heard people blame their mistakes on so-called computer errors,
although in reality computers seldom make errors. Sure, the results may not
always be what we expect, but that doesn’t mean the computer was wrong.
More often, the problem is simple human error caused when someone asked
the wrong question.
Spreadsheets can easily produce results that aren’t what you expect. Until
someone invents a computer that does what you mean rather than what you
say, this will continue to be a problem. In a Pocket Excel spreadsheet, if you
don’t get the results that you want, it’s usually because you either entered
the wrong information or you have an error in a formula. Either way, you
need to edit your spreadsheet to correct the problem.
For some editing chores, you can use the Edit menu commands (see Figure
10-4). For example, if you want to fill a group of cells with a sequence of
values, use the Edit➪Fill command. The other Edit menu commands include:
 Edit➪Undo: Returns the spreadsheet to where it was before your last
entry
 Edit➪Redo: Undoes the change made by the Edit➪Undo command
 Edit➪Cut: Removes a selection and places it on the Clipboard
 Edit➪Copy: Places a copy of the selection on the Clipboard without
removing it from the spreadsheet
 Edit➪Paste: Adds the Clipboard contents to the spreadsheet
 Edit➪Paste Special: Controls how the Clipboard contents are pasted —
such as just the current values of formulas rather than the formulas
themselves
164
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

 Edit➪Clear: Removes cell contents or formatting
 Edit➪Select All: Selects everything in the spreadsheet so that the next
command you issue applies to all of the selection
 Edit➪Fill: Automatically fills a selected range of cells with a series of
values
 Edit➪Find/Replace: Locates all instances of a specific value
 Edit➪Password: Sets or changes the password that’s needed to open
the spreadsheet
 Edit➪Rename/Move: Changes the name or storage location for the
spreadsheet
The Edit menu commands aren’t very useful when you want to modify a for-
mula. For that, you need to attack the problem directly by selecting the cell
that you want to modify, and then tapping in the formula bar (the area just
below the time display in the upper-right of the Pocket Excel screen). Figure
10-5 shows how the screen appears when you’re editing a formula.
When you’re editing or creating a formula, you can open the Insert Function
screen by tapping the Insert Function button just to the left of the formula
bar. The Insert Function button is the one labeled fx. Tap the other two but-
tons to the left of the formula bar to enter your changes (with the check mark
button) or to discard any changes (with the X button).
Figure 10-4:
Use the
Edit menu
commands
to modify
your spread-
sheet.
165
Chapter 10: Managing Your Calculations

If you forget to tap the formula bar before you begin entering something in a
cell, you replace the entire contents of the cell rather than editing it. If this
happens, immediately select Edit➪Undo before you do anything else.
Controlling the view
One of the biggest problems with using a Pocket Excel spreadsheet is that you
can’t see very much of the spreadsheet at one time. There’s just so much going
on to clutter the screen that you don’t have much room for useful information.
As Figure 10-6 shows, you can control just how much of that junk appears on
the screen by using the View menu options. The five items at the top of this
menu are all toggles, so each time you select them they either appear or dis-
appear depending on whether they’re currently visible.
If possible, place all the cells into which you need to enter information near
the upper-left corner of your Pocket Excel spreadsheet. That way you may be
able to hide the scroll bars and still easily input data.

bar.

Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

If your spreadsheet has more than one worksheet, choose View➪Sheet to
select a different worksheet. You can also use the worksheet selector button
that appears in the center of the toolbar (just above the menu bar) if the
Toolbar is visible. To make the toolbar visible, choose View➪Toolbar.
The View➪Split and View➪Freeze Panes commands enable you to see
different areas of your spreadsheet at the same time. Although you may find
View➪Freeze Panes useful in making certain that you’re working in the cor-
rect row or column, the iPAQ’s screen is really too small for View➪Split to be
of much use.
View➪Full Screen devotes the maximum possible screen area to displaying
your spreadsheet. When you select this command, every Pocket Excel ele-
ment that can be hidden disappears from view.
Finally, View➪Zoom lets you zoom in or out on your spreadsheet while leav-
ing all other screen elements normal size. This command is most effective if
you combine it with View➪Full Screen.

Chapter 10: Managing Your Calculations

Formatting cells
Formatting changes the appearance but not the contents of cells in your
spreadsheet. You have an extensive set of formatting options in Pocket Excel.
To select the cell-formatting options, first select the cells that you want to
format. Then, choose Format➪Cells to display the Format Cells screen. This
screen has several tabs that you can use to make the following changes:
 Size: Control the row height and column width. Normally, Pocket Excel
adjusts these dimensions automatically, but you can change them for
more precise control. You can also drag a row or column border to
resize them just as you do in Excel on your desktop PC.
 Number: Select the numeric format used to display numerical values.
Selecting the correct numeric format can make the difference between
numbers that are impossible to decipher and ones that are instantly rec-
ognizable. For example, if a cell is supposed to indicate an important
date, 6/26/2000 is probably easier to understand than 36703, the date
serial number that corresponds to June 26, 2000. (Date serial numbers
are the number of days since December 30, 1899.)
 Align: Control the positioning of text and numbers within cells. By default,
numbers line up along the right side of the cell and text lines up to the
left. The alignment options even allow you to wrap text to fit within the
width of the column.
 Font: Use a different typeface or other font characteristics such as bold
or colored text. You can use any font that is installed on your iPAQ.
 Borders: Add lines around cells or a background color. (This tab has
nothing to do with a bookstore or emigrating to another country.)
The Format menu has several other commands that you can use to modify
your spreadsheet:
 Format➪Row and Format➪Column: These commands enable you to
hide or display entire rows or columns and to remove any changes that
you may have made on the Size tab of the Format Cells screen. Note,
though, that removing changes to cell height or row width by using the
Autofit option only works if you actually have some entries in the same
row (or column) when you select the Autofit command.
 Format➪Modify Sheets: This command provides you with a tool for
adding or deleting worksheets, renaming worksheets, or moving work-
sheets so that they appear in a different order.
 Format➪Insert Cells and Format➪Delete Cells: These are pretty easy to
figure out. It’s probably no surprise that you use these commands to add
or remove cells from your spreadsheet.
168
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

Navigating in Pocket Excel
Because so little of a typical Pocket Excel spreadsheet fits on the screen at
the same time, you need efficient ways to move around. You can move to a
different location in your spreadsheet in several ways:
 Use the scroll bars to change the visible area of the spreadsheet. Remem-
ber, though, that until you tap a new cell, the cell that was selected
remains selected. It doesn’t matter that you’re viewing a different set of
cells — viewing is not the same as selecting!
 Use the arrow keys on the on-screen keyboard to move around. Because
this method does move the cell selector, it also selects a new cell, and
that cell is the one that receives any input when you start typing.
 Use the navigation button just below the center of your iPAQ’s screen.
This button moves the cell selector as you rock the navigation button
left, right, up, or down.
 To move a long distance, choose Tools➪Go To to display the Go To
screen, shown in Figure 10-7. You can enter either a cell address or a
name if your spreadsheet has names assigned to cells.
The easiest way to move to a different worksheet is to use the worksheet
selector button in the status bar.
Figure 10-7:
Use Tools➪

169
Chapter 10: Managing Your Calculations

Exchanging Spreadsheet Data
Pocket Excel uses the same three-ring circus for exchanging data with other
computers that you’ve grown familiar with from other iPAQ applications. But
just in case you’ve forgotten, your choices are
 Tools➪Beam Workbook: Beams your spreadsheet to another iPAQ user.
Doesn’t this almost make you feel like you’re back in grade school pass-
ing notes?
 Tools➪Send via E-mail: Sends your spreadsheet file as an e-mail attach-
ment. May as well spread the work around, right?
 ActiveSync: If you have ActiveSync set up to synchronize your files,
your spreadsheet is copied to your desktop PC when you pop your iPAQ
into the cradle.
Pocket Excel spreadsheets may not be the most exciting way to use your
iPAQ, but they sure can put a lot of power in your pocket. Almost any Excel
spreadsheet from your desktop PC will run on your iPAQ, so maybe one day
you can convince your boss that you were late because you had to stop and
run some budget numbers on your way to work.
Calculating the Uses of 
the Pocket Calculator
You already know a dozen different uses for your desktop calculator, but the
calculator in your iPAQ has some unique uses, too. Here are a few of the ways
that you can use your iPAQ calculator:
 If you’re writing a note on your iPAQ and need to do some quick calcula-
tions to figure out how much more business you need to do to increase
revenues by 7.8 percent next year, you can pop open the calculator and
get some good numbers. And because you can copy and paste from the
calculator, you don’t need to retype those numbers.
 When you’re out for lunch with those stingy people who never seem to
remember to add in their part of the tax and tip, you can use the calcula-
tor to let them know what their share of the bill really is. (Or you can
simply use the Address Book to choose a better dining companion in the
future.)
 If you’re using Pocket Money or Pocket Quicken to manage your finances,
you can use the calculator to add up your bank deposits and then copy
the results directly into your transactions (see Chapter 11).
170
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

 Finally, you can gather up all those funky calculators that you got for free
and clear a bunch of space on your desk. And because everybody likes to
get something for nothing, you could walk around the office giving every-
one the gift of a free calculator and make everyone think that you’re
really a nice person. Just watch out when the office gardener comes by
trying to give away zucchini — you’ll probably be on the top of his list!
Doing Some Calculations
To open the iPAQ’s calculator, click the Start button and choose Programs
from the Start menu. Then, tap Calculator in the Programs folder. Figure 10-8
shows the calculator.
The calculator includes a currency conversion feature for those of you who
travel in countries where you may need to know how the local prices com-
pare to Euros. To use this feature, tap the third icon in the Toolbar (the icon
with three different money symbols).
When the calculator is open, tap the buttons to enter numbers and perform
calculations. As you enter numbers, they appear in the box just above the
keys. This box also shows the results of your calculations.
If the on-screen keyboard pops up when you open the calculator, tap the key-
board icon next to the lower-right side of the menu bar to hide the keyboard.
Although you may think the on-screen keyboard could be useful when enter-
ing symbols like parentheses in a calculation, the iPAQ’s calculator ignores
any such attempts to get fancy. What you see on the face of the calculator
really is all you get.
I’m sure that you can figure out most of the keys, but a few keys you may not
recognize or realize just how powerful they are:
 M+ adds the current value into memory so that you can use it later in a
calculation. Because the calculator lacks nesting — essentially, the abil-
ity to perform sub-calculations through the use of parentheses — you
have to use the calculator’s memory if you need to get very fancy.
 MR recalls the value that’s stored in memory. You can recall the same
value as often as necessary, so you can store a value that you want to
apply in a series of calculations (such as marking up prices by a set
percentage).
 MC clears the current value stored in memory. Memory stores a cumula-
tive value, so clear the memory first if you want to replace what is in
memory rather than adding to it.
171
Chapter 10: Managing Your Calculations

 +/– switches the sign of the currently displayed value so that positive
numbers become negative, and negative numbers become positive. Use
this key if you want to subtract the displayed value from whatever is
currently stored in memory.
 CE clears the currently displayed value without messing up your exist-
ing calculation. Use this key if you make a mistake entering a value and
don’t want to go back to the beginning and re-enter all your numbers.
 C clears the entire calculation so that you can start fresh.
 √gives you the square root of the currently displayed value. Even though
most roots are actually a lot closer to round, if you really need a square
one for something, this is the place to find it.
 1/x inverts a number. Essentially, inverting a number means that the cal-
culator divides 1 by the number that is currently displayed. My favorite
number to invert is 0.
The rest of the calculator keys are for entering numbers or performing simple
calculations.
Even though the iPAQ’s calculator has only a single memory, you can store
two values if you’re tricky enough. Use the memory keys to store one value
and use Edit➪Copy to store the other. Choose Edit➪Paste when you want to
reinsert the value that you stored by using Edit➪Copy.
You can also use Edit➪Copy and Edit➪Paste to share values with other iPAQ
applications.

Tracking Your Money
In This Chapter
 Finding uses for iPAQ expense tracking programs
 Using Microsoft Money for Pocket PC
 Using Pocket Quicken
 Exploring other options for tracking your money
You’ve probably noticed that keeping track of your money is awfully impor-
tant. This is especially true if you have business expenses that you need
to manage or an expense account to prepare. Your iPAQ is the perfect tool for
helping you with this sometimes-tedious task.
In this chapter, I show you several options for tracking your money on your
iPAQ. You can probably determine the best choice for you based on how you
currently manage your expenses. If you happen to use Microsoft Money on
your desktop system, Microsoft Money for Pocket PC is likely your best
option. If you are a Quicken fan, Pocket Quicken is right up your alley. If you
don’t use either Money or Quicken, you may want to try out one of the other
options that I mention. Regardless of your choice, your iPAQ makes it far
easier to remember where all the money went.
Handy Uses for iPAQ Expense Managers
Your iPAQ is very adept at helping you manage your money. But maybe you’re
having a hard time figuring out how you can use this capability in your daily
grind. Well, never fear; I’m going to give you some ideas that will have you
reaching for that stylus in no time. Here are just a few of the ways that you can
use an expense manager on your iPAQ:
 If you have an expense account, you probably end up paying lots of 
business-related expenses (like bridge tolls, parking meters, umbrellas,
and so on) out of your own pocket simply because it’s too much trouble
to keep track of those miscellaneous expenses. With an expense man-
ager, you can easily keep track of those costs along with a complete
record of the date and time of the expense. And after you’ve entered an

expense one time, these programs typically remember most of the
details so that you can enter it far more quickly the next time around.
You’ll probably end up getting far more than the cost of your iPAQ back
in extra expense money for all those little items that used to be too much
trouble to track!
 Even if you aren’t on an expense account, you can keep better track of
your business-related expenses so that you don’t forget to claim them at
tax time. Guess what? These programs are as handy at making sure that
you get all the business deductions you deserve as it is at making certain
that the other lucky guy gets his expenses reimbursed.
 If you handle petty cash for your organization, you can use your iPAQ
expense manager to track where all the money goes. There’s no sense
letting anyone have any questions about whether you’re being honest,
is there?
 If you’re the person who’s always getting stuck making the lunch run for
the office, why not use your expense manager to keep track of everyone’s
running bill? That way, you’re more likely to get paid back on payday —
especially if you’ve got some people with poor memories who always
seem to forget at least some of what they owe you.
 Some of these programs can also keep track of the stocks in your port-
folio. Whenever you go online to check your e-mail, they can let you
know if now is the right time to announce your retirement party or if 
you need to ask for a bit more overtime.
Managing Your Money with Microsoft
Money for Pocket PC
Microsoft Money for Pocket PC is a little money manager program that’s
available for your iPAQ. This handy program helps you keep track of where
all your money went. It works seamlessly in conjunction with Microsoft
Money on your desktop PC.
You must have the 2004 (or later) version of both Microsoft Money and
Microsoft Money for Pocket PC if your iPAQ uses Windows Mobile 2003. If you
have an earlier version of Windows Money, you must upgrade to the current
version before you can install the program on your iPAQ.
If you already use Microsoft Money on your desktop PC, Microsoft Money for
Pocket PC should be quite familiar and easy to use. Microsoft Money for Pocket
PC concentrates on a few basic money management functions rather than
trying to cover all the bases. Getting to know Microsoft Money for Pocket PC
takes only a few minutes, and it’s time well spent.
174
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

Setting Microsoft Money 
for Pocket PC’s options
Microsoft Money for Pocket PC has very few options, but take a quick look
at them to help you understand how the program works. To begin, open
Microsoft Money for Pocket PC by clicking the Start button and choosing
Programs from the Start menu to display the Programs folder. Then, tap the
Microsoft Money icon. When Microsoft Money for Pocket PC opens, choose
Tools➪Options to display the Options screen.
You probably want to leave all three of the following options selected:
 AutoComplete+: This option makes Microsoft Money for Pocket PC far
easier to use because you don’t have to do nearly as much typing. When
this option is selected, Microsoft Money for Pocket PC fills in most entries
for you by using its best guess based on previous entries. If you eat the
same lunch at Joe’s Diner a couple times each week, Microsoft Money
for Pocket PC can fill out the whole transaction as soon as it recognizes
that you’re starting off with “Joe’s” as the payee.
 AutoFill: This option helps you by entering the same amount and cat-
egory for a payee. You can easily overwrite these entries, but if they 
are correct, you don’t have to.
 Use Large Font: This option simply makes it easier to read the iPAQ’s
screen when you’re using Microsoft Money for Pocket PC. There’s really
no reason not to choose this option.
Almost no one needs the options on the Proxy Server tab. (Those of you who
do already know who you are, don’t you?) Proxy servers are special computers
that provide access to the Internet while preventing unauthorized traffic. In
the case of Microsoft Money for Pocket PC, the proxy server settings are used
only if you set up Microsoft Money for Pocket PC to track your investments
and you need to use a proxy server to access the Internet. Confused yet?
Don’t worry about it — if none of this sounds familiar, it’s a good indicator
that it doesn’t apply to you. Your online broker is the most likely source of
information on this subject.
If you find yourself using Microsoft Money for Pocket PC often, click the
Program Button link near the bottom of the Options screen to assign one of
the buttons on the front of your iPAQ to opening Microsoft Money for Pocket
PC. You have to decide which of the currently assigned buttons to reassign to
Microsoft Money for Pocket PC. To reassign the front panel buttons on your
iPAQ to any other application, tap the Start button, select Settings, and then
tap the Buttons icon.
After you select the three options, tap OK to close the options screen.

Chapter 11: Tracking Your Money

Using a password
For many applications, passwords can be more trouble than they’re worth.
After all, if someone else uses your Internet account for a few minutes, who
cares? (As long as they stay away from your e-mail account, that is.) Most
likely, your Internet account is set up for unlimited access, so if a friend
needs to get on the Internet, you’re probably quite willing to let her use your
PC and your account.
For Microsoft Money for Pocket PC, though, a password can be really impor-
tant because you enter your account numbers and other confidential infor-
mation that you probably don’t want to broadcast to the world. And you
certainly want to make getting into your account harder in case a thief tries
to steal your iPAQ.
To add a password that’s needed to even open Microsoft Money for Pocket
PC, choose Tools➪Password to display the screen shown in Figure 11-1.
Enter your password in both boxes and tap OK. You need to enter the same
password twice to make certain that you’ve actually typed in what you
thought you did. If the two entries don’t match, Microsoft Money for Pocket
PC rejects them.

176
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

Be awfully careful when you’re creating a password for Microsoft Money for
Pocket PC. If you forget what you entered, you won’t be able to open Microsoft
Money for Pocket PC or access the data in it. It’s a really good idea to close
Microsoft Money for Pocket PC as soon as you’ve added a password and then
re-open the program. That way you can check that your password is correct
before you spend a lot of time setting up accounts or entering information. If
you can’t remember your password, you have to use ActiveSync to remove
Microsoft Money for Pocket PC from your iPAQ and then re-install it. Any data
that you’ve entered in Microsoft Money for Pocket PC will be lost if you do this.
Setting up a new account
You have to set up an account in Microsoft Money for Pocket PC before you
can use the program. An account is simply your checking account, a petty
cash account, a credit card, or something similar. You can set up as many dif-
ferent accounts as you need. Each account is separate from all the others, so
it’s fine to set up special accounts for specific purposes.
To create a new account, choose New on the Microsoft Money for Pocket PC
menu bar. This displays the account setup screen, shown in Figure 11-2.
Figure 11-2:

177
Chapter 11: Tracking Your Money

Fill in the blanks on this screen as follows:
 Account Name: In this field, enter a descriptive name for the account. If
you’re going to be sharing information with Money on your desktop PC,
use the same account name as the one on your desktop PC. Enter a
name that makes it easy for you to select the correct account so that
you don’t accidentally enter transactions into the wrong account.
 Account Type: Select the type of account from this drop-down list box.
Microsoft Money for Pocket PC uses the account type to control how it
handles transactions, so be sure that you choose the correct type. For
example, if the account type is a checking account, Microsoft Money for
Pocket PC automatically enters sequential check numbers to record
transactions.
 Opening Balance: Use this field to indicate how much money is cur-
rently in the account. Here you need to remember that Microsoft Money
for Pocket PC is going to start off with the amount that you enter here,
so enter the amount in the account as it exists just before you enter
your first transaction. For example, if you’re going to track your check-
ing account, enter the amount of money shown in your check register
just before the first check you’re going to record in Microsoft Money for
Pocket PC.
 Credit Limit: For a credit card or credit line account, use this field to
indicate your total credit limit for this account.
 Interest Rate: If the account is an interest-bearing account, enter the
appropriate rate in this field.
Next, click the Optional tab. Here you enter information that you may need to
access your account (like your account number).
The information on the Optional tab is optional for a good reason. You don’t
want to make it easy for someone else to access your accounts without your
authorization. If you fill out this tab, make certain that you have password pro-
tected Microsoft Money for Pocket PC, as I discuss in the preceding section.
Click OK when you have finished setting up the account.
Organizing your money by using categories
One of the best ways to keep track of where you’ve spent your money is to
organize things into categories. You can have categories like office expenses,
business travel, groceries, entertaining, and that all-important one — choco-
late! If you want to use categories in Microsoft Money for Pocket PC, you have
to set them up yourself. To make certain that you actually use the categories
when you finally do enter transactions, set up at least some basic categories
before you start entering transactions.
178
Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

To create your categories, follow these steps:
1. Click the View list (the list just below the Start button that indicates
what is currently being displayed).
If you’ve just added a new account, the View list is probably showing
“Account Manager.”
2. Select Categories from the View list.
3. When the View list indicates Categories, choose New to create a new
category.
4. Use the boxes on this new category screen to enter the information
about your categories.
Each category must have a unique name — you can’t have the same
category listed as both an income and an expense category. Slight varia-
tions can be used if you can’t think of a creative way to name a category.
5. If you want to break down a category further, use the Subcategory
Of drop-down list box for the new categories that are a part of the
category.
For example, you might want subcategories of your Medical category for
dental, doctor, and drug-related expenses.
6. To make a note reminding yourself of something special about a cat-
egory, enter your note in the Memo text box.
7. Click OK when you finish setting up each category.
Entering your transactions
After you create accounts and set up categories, you can start throwing in
some transactions. Now you get to see where the money is really going.
Start by selecting Account Register from the View list. If you’ve set up more
than one account, select the account that you want to use from the Account
list to the right of the View list. Figure 11-3 shows how your account register
appears after you’ve entered several transactions.
To add a new transaction, choose New to display the new transaction screen.
As you begin filling in the Payee text box, Microsoft Money for Pocket PC tries
to help out by entering the matching information for the last transaction with
this same payee.
After you complete the fields on the Required tab, you can use the fields on
the Optional tab to add more information about the transaction. (The Optional
tab is where you select a category to help organize your accounts.)
179
Chapter 11: Tracking Your Money

Use the Void option in the Status drop-down list box to record checks that
you voided so you don’t forget and get in a panic trying to remember what
happened to the missing check.
When you’re finished entering information, tap OK to complete the transaction.
If you enter a transaction in error, tap-and-hold the transaction in the transac-
tions list, and then tap the Delete Transaction button. Microsoft Money for
Pocket PC asks to confirm that you really do want to send the transaction to
the dump.
You can edit an existing transaction by tapping it to open the transaction
screen. Make your changes and then click OK.
The bottom of the transaction screen has a menu item called Split. Use Split
to create transactions that are a bit more complicated, such as bank deposits
that include funds from more than one payee. When you create a split, you
need to allocate the money between different sources. You enter each indi-
vidual part of the transaction in the Split screen, specifying the amount of the
individual part. For example, if you make a bank deposit that includes $500
from your paycheck and $20 that you won in the office football pool, you
create one entry for $500 and one for $20. When you are finished entering the
individual entries in the split transaction, tap OK to enter the total transac-
tion into the transaction record.

Part III: Putting Your iPAQ to Work 

Tracking your investments
Microsoft Money for Pocket PC can also keep track of your stock market
investments. If you have an Internet connection on your iPAQ, you can even
get delayed stock quotes. But your iPAQ doesn’t offer hot stock picks — you
still have to rely on your brother-in-law for that type of information.
To add your favorite stocks to the Microsoft Money for Pocket PC Investments
list, select Investments from the View list. Then, choose New and enter the
name of the investment and the other details in the appropriate fields (the
stock ticker symbol, the price per share, and the number of shares you own)
about the investment. Click OK when you’re finished.
Be sure that you enter the correct stock market symbol for each of your
investments. Microsoft Money for Pocket PC uses the symbol to locate the
current market value.
After you enter your stocks, choose Tools➪Update Investments (or click the
Update Investments button just to the right of the Tools menu) to get a delayed
market price for those stocks. You need an Internet connection through your
iPAQ (see Chapter 12) to get this update.
Sharing the numbers with Money 
If you have Microsoft Money loaded on your desktop PC, you can share the
Microsoft Money for Pocket PC information from your iPAQ with Money. By
sharing this information, you can keep track of expenses on your iPAQ and
then update the files on your desktop PC.
To share information between Microsoft Money and Microsoft Money for
Pocket PC, you must select Money as one of the synchronization options in
ActiveSync (see Chapter 5). Unfortunately, if you use a different money man-
agement program (such as Quicken), you can’t share information between
Microsoft Money for Pocket PC and the other program on an ongoing basis.
In fact, you can share your Quicken data only if you first load Money on 
your desktop PC and then import your Quicken data into Money. That’s why
Quicken users should read the following section on Pocket Quicken, of course.
If you intend to share information between Microsoft Money for Pocket PC on
your iPAQ and Money on your desktop PC, make certain that you have set up
Money on your desktop PC and have established the synchronization before
you add information to Microsoft Money for Pocket PC. Otherwise, you have
to remove Microsoft Money for Pocket PC from your iPAQ and then reinstall it
to add the synchronization option to your iPAQ.
181
Chapter 11: Tracking Your Money

Data sharing between Money and Microsoft Money for Pocket PC is strictly a
one-to-one relationship. You can’t share the same information between an
iPAQ and two desktop PCs, nor can you share information between two iPAQs
and one desktop PC.
Managing Your Money 
with Pocket Quicken
If you’re already a Quicken user, you probably put the idea of switching to
Microsoft Money right up there with slamming a car door on your hand — or
maybe worse. Unfortunately, if you want to use Quicken on your desktop, you
won’t find Microsoft Money for Pocket PC to be very friendly because the two
programs simply don’t work well together.
Actually, you can share your desktop Quicken data with your iPAQ and
Microsoft Money for Pocket PC, but only one time, and then only to send data
to your iPAQ. But this arrangement requires you to manually update Quicken
on your desktop after you’ve added information into Microsoft Money for
Pocket PC if you want the two to agree.
A far better option for Quicken users is Pocket Quicken from LandWare
(www.landware.com). Pocket Quicken works directly with the version of
Quicken on your desktop (Quicken 99 or later) and automatically synchro-
nizes your accounts between your desktop and your iPAQ.
Setting up Pocket Quicken
Pocket Quicken automatically sets up the accounts on your iPAQ to match
those on your desktop version of Quicken. As a result, you probably don’t
have to spend much time setting up Pocket Quicken on your own. Figure 11-4
shows an example of how Pocket Quicken might look when you first open the
program on your iPAQ.
Entering your transactions
Entering transactions in Pocket Quicken is also extremely easy because the
program fills in a lot of information for you (just the way desktop Quicken
does). To enter a transaction, choose New and choose the type of transaction
you wish to record from the drop-down Ref field. Figure 11-5 shows how the
screen appears when entering a payment.

Chapter 11: Tracking Your Money

Tap the Details tab to set or find out the status of a transaction. Use the Memo
tab to create a free-form note to yourself to remind you of important details
that you might otherwise forget — such as the reason why your lunch was so
expensive. You can also use the Split button for more complex transactions,
such as bank deposits from several sources.
When you tap the Done button, Pocket Quicken records the transaction on
your iPAQ. The next time you synchronize your iPAQ with your desktop, the
transaction will automatically be added to your desktop Quicken files. You
don’t have to worry about remembering to enter the transaction on your
desktop.
Organizing your budget
Pocket Quicken does have one feature that it doesn’t share with desktop
Quicken. As Figure 11-6 shows, Pocket Quicken enables you to create budgets
on your iPAQ. You can set specific goals for both income and expenses and
let your iPAQ keep track of your success. To use this feature, select Budgets
from the drop-down view list, and then select New and choose the type of
budget that you wish to create.

Exploring Other Options
Okay, so maybe you’re just not a Microsoft Money or Quicken type. You don’t
want to be told how to manage your money, do you? Well, if that’s the case,
perhaps you should check out a couple other money management options for
your iPAQ.
Cash Organizer
Cash Organizer from Inesoft (www.inesoft.com) is designed as a complete
iPAQ-based financial planning and management program. It does not rely
upon a desktop PC-based money management program, but rather it offers
some pretty powerful features all by itself. Figure 11-7 shows a typical trans-
action entry in Cash Organizer.
Even though Cash Organizer is designed to be an independent solution, it can
both import and export data in a number of formats. You could, for example,
import information from Microsoft Money or Quicken, or you could export
information to Excel. In addition, Cash Organizer automatically uses your iPAQ
contact list so that you don’t have to retype existing contact information.
Figure 11-7:

Chapter 11: Tracking Your Money

EZ-Expense
EZ-Expense from Soft Pocket Solutions (www.softpocketsolutions.com) is
by far the simplest, most focused program covered in this chapter. EZ-Expense
does one very important job — it manages your expenses. As such, it is espe-
cially useful for any iPAQ user who must turn in expense account reports in
order to get reimbursed for all the costs of doing business.
As Figure 11-8 shows, EZ-Expense concentrates on making life easy — at least
when it comes to filing expense reports, that is. When you incur an expense,
you just pull out your iPAQ, start EZ-Expense, tap an icon, and enter the
expense. With specific icons corresponding to different expense categories,
it’s pretty clear where to place the various little charges.
Although EZ-Expense is not intended for full financial management duties, it
does offer the option of exporting your expense reports in an Excel spread-
sheet. This makes it a very simple task to create your expense report in what-
ever format your company requires.

Part IV
The iPAQ and 
the Internet

In this part . . .
You discover how you can use your iPAQ to access the
Internet as well as your local network. Here you ﬁnd
out just how you can surf the Internet and handle your
e-mail virtually anywhere. You may even be able to make
use of some wireless Internet options as well as the more
familiar wired connections. I also show you why the new
Wi-Fi option is so popular as a means of being connected
with your iPAQ.

Chapter 12
Connecting Your iPAQ
In This Chapter
 Understanding the iPAQ Internet connection
 Choosing your hardware
 Making a connection
 Using Wi-Fi with your iPAQ
T
hese days, whether you’ll want to connect your iPAQ to the Internet is
no longer a question; the only real question is how you’ll connect it. And
with all the options now available, you may even choose more than one way
to connect so that you can always send that e-mail or check on the latest
news on the Web.
Nowadays, it’s easier than ever to go online with your iPAQ. In this chapter, I
cover the options so that you can decide which ones are best for your needs.
Along the way, you also see how many of these same options can enable you
to access your own network for faster synchronization or even to use your
iPAQ to control and run applications on your desktop PC.
What You Need to Connect
You can connect your iPAQ to the Internet or your local network in many differ-
ent ways. In some cases, the necessary hardware is built into your iPAQ, but
that isn’t always true. In the following sections, I go over a number of things
that you need to consider to determine just what you need to get connected.
I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but your iPAQ needs help when it comes
to the Internet. iPAQs don’t come with the hardware necessary to connect
directly to the Internet. For that, you’re going to have to get some extra pieces,
which I go over in the following sections.

Understanding the iPAQ 
hardware realities
If being able to connect your iPAQ to the Internet is such a big deal, why
doesn’t every iPAQ simply include all the necessary pieces to make the 
connection? Unfortunately, this is one of those problems that’s a lot more
complex than it seems. When it comes to connecting an iPAQ to the Internet,
a solution that’s perfect for me may not work at all for you. Indeed, a solution
that works perfectly for you in some cases may be totally useless in others.
Here are some things to consider:
 Some iPAQ models have built-in Wi-Fi (or 802.11b) — wireless networking.
(The 802.11b is simply a standard for this type of wireless networking.) If
you have access to a wireless network, this may be an ideal way to con-
nect. But Wi-Fi isn’t built into every iPAQ, so you may need to buy a Wi-Fi
adapter card if you want to use this option.
 The most common type of expansion slot on iPAQs is the Secure Digital
(SD) slot. The SD slots on most iPAQ models are actually SDIO slots, which
are slots that can be used for more than just memory cards — they can
also be used for input or output (the IO part of SDIO). But if you want to
use the SD slot for a memory card — as is so often the case — then you’ll
have no place to add a Wi-Fi adapter card.
 A few iPAQ models also offer a CompactFlash (CF) expansion slot. This
gives you two slots instead of just one. With two slots you can add both
a memory card and a Wi-Fi (or other type) adapter.
 Most iPAQ models also include built-in Bluetooth capabilities. Bluetooth
is another type of wireless connection, but it’s typically not very useful
for connecting to the Internet unless you happen to have one of those
very rare Bluetooth-enabled cell phones. Bluetooth is awfully handy for
some other uses, though. See Chapter 19 for one great example.
 If you don’t mind being connected via the sync cable to your desktop PC,
you can connect your iPAQ to the Internet via the pass through feature of
ActiveSync. Of course, if you’re close enough to your desktop system to
be connected with the sync cable, you’ll probably prefer surfing the Net
with the larger screen on your desktop PC.
 Certain wired modems enable you to connect your iPAQ to the Internet
via an ordinary phone line, but so far none of these fit an SD slot — you
need a CF slot for this.
 Wireless modems are currently available as CF devices. These essentially
connect via the cell phone network and are typically quite expensive to
buy and use. Also, they tend to be quite slow and are really only suitable
if you absolutely must always be connected, and no better option exists.
190
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

 Another slow wireless connection option is the digital phone card that
connects via your cell phone. Digital phone cards are specific to certain
brands and models of cell phones. You must get the correct one for your
phone, and you must have a CF slot in your iPAQ to use one.
Understanding the service 
availability realities
Before you get your hopes set on one type of Internet connection option for
your iPAQ, you’ve also got to consider another very important factor: Can
you even use the hardware in the area where you are? Here are some very
important considerations:
 You probably take it for granted that you can plug a regular wired modem
into most regular phone jacks and make a connection. While this is
mostly true, you do have to be aware that some phone jacks can kill your
modem. Digital phone lines — such as the ones in many businesses —
produce voltages that will fry your modem. So if you want to use your
wired modem, you may not be able to do so from your office or hotel
room unless you can plug into an analog phone line. You definitely want
to check this by asking the hotel before plugging in.
 Wi-Fi connections are becoming more common, but you may not always
be able to find a service that you can log onto. A lot of companies are
setting up hotspots in places like coffee shops and airports, so those can
be good places to look for a signal. In most cases, you need to use a
credit card to sign up for access, but you can usually do so online. (I
offer more information about hotspots later in this chapter in the sec-
tion “Connecting to public hotspots.”)
 Wireless modems typically require Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD)
service. Unfortunately, CDPD coverage is not available in all areas. You
can most likely find good coverage in large metropolitan areas, but it’s
not widespread enough yet that you can take it for granted.
 Digital phone cards require a digital phone and digital service. If your cell
phone is analog, you can’t use a digital phone card. If your cell phone is
digital, but the signal in your area is only analog, you can’t connect with
a digital phone card.
 Wireless modems typically require a separate service contract from your
cell phone contract, which can get quite expensive — especially when
you consider that a digital phone card generally allows you to connect
with little or no extra charge other than your airtime. If you have a cell
phone contract that leaves you with lots of unused airtime each month,
the difference could be considerable.
191
Chapter 12: Connecting Your iPAQ

Check with wireless service providers to see what service is offered in your
area before you get too hung up on selecting one type of Internet connection
for you iPAQ. There’s no sense in wasting time researching options that simply
aren’t available to you.
Choosing Your Hardware Options
After you’ve decided on the type of service that you want to use to connect
your iPAQ to the Internet, you need to pick out the hardware — assuming
that your iPAQ doesn’t already include the proper connection option, of
course. By picking the type of service first, you don’t waste any time buying
the wrong equipment.
Here I take a quick look at the hardware options that you may want to consider.
Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is the nickname given to 802.11x wireless networking. For iPAQs, this
usually means 802.11b, but it can also mean 802.11g (a faster version, but
generally compatible with 802.11b). Another standard, known as 802.11a, is
incompatible with the iPAQ version of Wi-Fi.
192
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 
Online versus offline viewing
Just how important is the difference between
live (online) and static (offline) viewing? There’s
an easy answer for that question: It depends.
Obviously, a lot of Web pages don’t change very
often. You probably don’t expect a Web page
that contains the text of an old Norwegian folk-
tale to be much different today than it was yes-
terday. That folktale — and that Web page —
probably will remain pretty much the same for
quite some time. If you download a copy of the
page today, it will still be just the same as the
copy that you downloaded last month.
On the other hand, a Web site that brings you
the latest news changes constantly. The copy
that you downloaded some time ago may not tell
you what you really want to know. For example,
if a severe storm is threatening your area, last
hour’s weather status probably doesn’t do you
much good. You may not know that a tornado is
about to strike if you depend on the one-hour-
old weather report showing that the storm is still
50 miles away.
And, of course, there’s e-mail to throw into the
picture, too. If you’re trying to negotiate a big deal
with someone and you’re using e-mail mes-
sages every few minutes to clinch the deal, it
would certainly help to be able to keep things
moving while you’re commuting. (You don’t want
your competitor to step in and make a better
offer to steal away the business.) But being
unconnected when you’re on the go may pre-
vent you from responding until it’s too late.

If your iPAQ has Wi-Fi built in, Wi-Fi is almost certainly your first choice for con-
necting. Later in this chapter, in the section “Understanding your network
connection options,” I show you some ways that you can easily add Wi-Fi if
your iPAQ doesn’t have this capability built in.
In addition to your own wireless network, you can use a Wi-Fi connection to
connect to public hotspots.
Bluetooth
Bluetooth is another wireless networking standard and is built into many cur-
rent iPAQ models. It’s hard to recommend attempting to make your Internet
connection via Bluetooth, however, because Bluetooth is really only intended
for very short-range operations (typically a maximum of about 30 feet). Still,
Bluetooth may be viable if you happen to have a Bluetooth-enabled cell phone.
Wired modems
Wired modems may not be the coolest way to connect your iPAQ to the
Internet, but they offer some real advantages over some other options. Not
only are wired modems inexpensive and fast, but you can connect through
the regular Internet account that you use on your desktop PC. But even if you
were to set up a separate Internet account just for your iPAQ, unlimited access
is generally quite reasonable. The one really big problem with wired modems,
though, is that they typically require a CF expansion slot — something that
few iPAQs offer.
Digital phone cards
If you already have a digital cell phone, a digital phone card may be available
for your phone. These phone cards plug into your iPAQ and your cell phone
and let you connect to the Internet wherever a digital cell phone signal is avail-
able. But like the wired modems, digital phone cards require a CF expansion
slot, so this may not be an option for you.
Wireless modems
Wireless modems function something like a cell phone for data. To use a wire-
less modem, you must subscribe to a wireless IP service plan from a carrier
such as AT&T Wireless, GoAmerica, or Verizon Wireless. These plans can be
very expensive, so it pays to shop around for the best deal.
193
Chapter 12: Connecting Your iPAQ

Most wireless modems were actually designed to fit the PC Card slot on a
laptop, and simply won’t work with your iPAQ. You might be able to find a
CF wireless modem, but this will only be useful if your iPAQ has a CF expan-
sion slot.
Setting Up a Wired Modem Connection
Before I show you how to set up a Wi-Fi connection, I take a quick look at how
to set up a wired modem connection. Setting up your wired modem to work
with your iPAQ probably seems fairly familiar — especially if you’ve ever
added a modem to your desktop PC. Your iPAQ automatically recognizes your
new modem, so all you have to do is set up the connection.
Be sure that you’ve pushed the modem fully into the expansion slot before
you begin.
Here’s the step-by-step procedure:
1. Click the Start button and choose Settings to open the Settings screen.
Then, tap the Connections tab (see Figure 12-1).
2. Tap the Connections icon to open the Connections screen.
3. Tap the Add a New Modem Connection link.
4. Enter a descriptive name for this connection in the first text box near
the top of the screen.
Make this name distinctive enough that you can tell your different con-
nections apart when you’re ready to connect.
5. Choose which modem you want to use from the Select a Modem list
box. If you have more than one type of modem, you see several
options in this list box.
6. Tap Next to continue.
7. Enter the correct dial-up number for your Internet service 
provider (ISP).
If you’re setting up a connection to use while you’re traveling, be sure to
enter the correct area code (and country code if you’ll be in another
country).

8. Add your user name and password to the top two text boxes.
You probably don’t need to fill in the Domain text box unless your ISP
has specifically told you to do so.
9. Tap Finish.
In most cases, you don’t need to change any of the advanced settings.
Be sure to take your iPAQ out of the cradle (or disconnect the sync cable)
before you attempt to use your modem. Your iPAQ can have only one active
connection at a time, and a connection to your desktop PC will prevent your
iPAQ from opening the modem connection.
When you’re finished using the connection, disconnect to free up the phone
line. (Your iPAQ eventually disconnects after a period of inactivity, but this
can take a half an hour or more.) To break the connection, tap the connection
button on the title bar and then tap End.
Even though modems use very little power when they aren’t in use, you can
extend your battery life a bit by removing the modem when you aren’t using it.

Chapter 12: Connecting Your iPAQ

Using Wi-Fi with Your iPAQ
By now, it should be pretty clear that a Wi-Fi connection really is the best
option for connecting your iPAQ to your own network and to the Internet. A
Wi-Fi connection offers faster data transfers than virtually any other method
that you might use, and because Wi-Fi is wireless, it’s certainly the most con-
venient to use.
Understanding Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi connections use very small, low-powered two-way radios to exchange
data. These connections operate by using a number of different frequencies
in the 2.4 GHz radio band. These frequencies are in a range of unlicensed fre-
quencies. This means that many different devices and users all share the
same set of frequencies — which can lead to interference, but this usually
doesn’t have much affect on Wi-Fi networks. In addition to Wi-Fi networks,
here are some other gadgets that use this same frequency band:
 Microwave ovens
 2.4 GHz cordless telephones
 Bluetooth devices
Did the last item surprise you? Yes, it’s true that Bluetooth and Wi-Fi share
many of the same frequencies. Fortunately, they seldom interfere (at least not
enough to cause major problems). That’s why some iPAQ models can include
(and use) both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.
Connecting to your network
Setting up a wireless network should be pretty easy, especially with an iPAQ
running the Windows Mobile 2003 operating system (OS). After all, Microsoft
touts “Zero-Configuration Wi-Fi” functionality as one of the benefits of this
latest version of the OS. In reality, though, I’ve generally found that it helps
an awful lot to know how to modify various settings if I want to avoid major
frustration.
Even if you have set up your own wired network in the past, you may not be
familiar with setting up a wireless network. However, the whole process is
fairly simple and you can be up and running in just a few minutes. Read on
for a look at a typical wireless network configuration.
196
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

In this example, I’m using D-Link DWL-2000AP 802.11g Access Point to pro-
vide access to the network (see Figure 12-2). Because this particular access
point uses the 802.11g standard, I can use both 802.11b and 802.11g wireless
network cards on my network. The 802.11g cards can run nearly five times as
fast as the 802.11b cards. You can find out more about this access point at
the D-Link Web site (www.dlink.com).
Here’s how to quickly connect to your wireless network (you can skip these
steps if your iPAQ has Wi-Fi capabilities built in):
1. Connect the access point to the hub, switch, or router on your network.
The access point connects to your desktop PC or your router with an
ordinary Cat-5 network cable. To maximize the range, place the access
point as high as possible. Or you may want to add a high-gain antenna as
I discuss later in this chapter in the section “Extending the range of your
Wi-Fi network.”
2. Place your iPAQ in the sync cradle and make certain that ActiveSync
connects to your iPAQ.
3. Insert the CD-ROM that came with the wireless network cards and
install the drivers.
Typically, the driver setup runs automatically when the CD-ROM is
inserted into the drive. Make certain that the drivers are fully installed
on your iPAQ before continuing.

197
Chapter 12: Connecting Your iPAQ

4. Remove your iPAQ from the sync cradle and turn it off.
You may also have to do a soft reset by pressing the iPAQ Reset button
with the stylus — check the directions that came with the wireless net-
work card. I have found that a soft reset at this point is generally a good
idea even if the instructions don’t mention it.
5. Insert the wireless network card into your iPAQ.
Your iPAQ will automatically turn itself back on once the card is inserted.
At this point, you need to wait a few moments while your iPAQ detects
the network.
If your iPAQ model has built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, you must turn on the radio
before you can use your wireless network. To do so, select iPAQ Wireless
from the Start menu to display the iPAQ Wireless screen shown in Figure 12-3.
Features that are turned off are orange, and those that are on are green. Tap
the WLAN icon to turn on the Wi-Fi radio. The radio defaults to being turned
off, so you should always check this setting first if you’re having trouble
connecting.
After your iPAQ has detected the network, two arrows (pointing left and
right) appear just to the left of the speaker icon on the Today screen title bar.
Tap these arrows to display the Connectivity pop-up shown in Figure 12-4.
The first time your iPAQ detects a network, you may see a pop-up asking if
you want to connect — if you see this message, be sure to confirm that you
do indeed want to connect.

Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

Adjusting the wireless configuration
In most cases, you should not have to do anything else except begin using
your wireless connection. However, if you do have any problems connecting
to either your network or the Internet, follow these steps:
1. Tap the two arrows to display the Connectivity pop-up, and then tap
the Settings link, which takes you to the Connections Settings screen.
2. Tap the Advanced tab, shown in Figure 12-5.
3. Tap the Select Networks button to display the Network Management
screen shown in Figure 12-6.
4. Choose the network settings from the drop-down list boxes.
In virtually every case, you should select the My Work Network option in
both list boxes. This setting enables your iPAQ to use your wireless con-
nection to access your desktop PC via ActiveSync and also to access the
Internet via your network’s shared Internet connection. If you select My
ISP, instead of My Network, you can only connect to the Internet and not
to your own network.
5. Tap OK to return to the Connections Settings screen.

Networks screen shown in Figure 12-7.
If you want to use your iPAQ to connect to public hotspots (which I dis-
cuss later in this chapter in the section “Connecting to public hotspots”)
make certain that you select the Automatically Connect to Non-Preferred
Networks option.
7. Tap your connection in the list box to display the screen shown in
Figure 12-8 (this screen is also called Configure Wireless Networks).
Select Work from the Connect To drop-down list box so that your iPAQ
can connect to your desktop PC via ActiveSync.
8. Tap the Authentication tab, shown in Figure 12-9.
9. Select the proper security settings for your network.
You can enable the security features for your network to prevent other
people from accessing your files. You need to enter that same key value
here that you entered when enabling security on your wireless access
point.
10. Tap OK three times to close the Settings screens.
Your wireless network should now be functional. Next, I look at some hard-
ware options that you can use to make the wireless connection possible.

Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

Understanding your network connection options
If your iPAQ lacks built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, you still have a number of excel-
lent options for connecting to wireless networks. These vary according to the
type of expansion slots that you have available, of course.
If your iPAQ has a single SDIO expansion slot and no CF expansion slot, you
may have to choose between adding Wi-Fi capabilities and expanding your
iPAQ’s memory. As this is being written, SanDisk has announced but not yet
released another option that you may wish to consider — an SD Wi-Fi adapter
card with 256MB of memory included. See the SanDisk Web site for more
information (www.sandisk.com).
Figure 12-10 shows three of the Wi-Fi adapters that I tested while writing 
this book.
From left to right, the Wi-Fi adapters shown in Figure 12-10 are:
 SMC SMC2642W Wireless CompactFlash Card (www.smc.com)
 SanDisk SD Wi-Fi Card (www.sandisk.com)
 D-Link DCF-660W Wireless CompactFlash Card (www.dlink.com)
Each of these adapters worked quite well, but the SMC and D-Link Wi-Fi cards
can only be used in iPAQ models that have a CF expansion slot.
Socket (www.socketcom.com) offers an SD Wi-Fi card that is similar to the
SanDisk card. Figure 12-11 shows just how small an SD Wi-Fi card really is.
The figure shows the card photographed next to a United States quarter. If
you buy one of these cards, be careful not to lose it!

203
Chapter 12: Connecting Your iPAQ

Each of the Wi-Fi adapter cards suffered from its own set of problems during
testing. These problems were mostly resolved by downloading and installing
updated drivers, but the SD Wi-Fi cards seemed to have a few more compati-
bility problems than the CF Wi-Fi cards had with different access point brands.
One way to reduce compatibility issues is to buy your adapter cards and
access points from a single manufacturer.

Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 
Wi-Fi security considerations
In doing research for this book, it became clear
to me that quite a few people really don’t under-
stand just how vulnerable they can be when
they install a wireless network. It’s true that a
wireless network makes it extremely easy for
you to move around and still access your net-
work without the bother of dragging a bunch of
cables, but this same ease and convenience
also makes it quite simple for neighbors or
strangers to connect to your network, too. And
this could give them easy and free access to
your sensitive files, your user names and pass-
words, your financial data, or even to your bank
and credit card accounts. Are you scared yet?
Actually, it’s not difficult to keep most unauthor-
ized people from accessing your wireless net-
work, but it seems like most people don’t realize
just how simple the access process is. Rather
than protecting themselves they seem to take
the attitude that “no one would be interested in
what’s on my computer.” Tell that to anyone
who has been the target of identity theft and see
if they agree with you.
If you want to keep the snoops out but still want
the convenience of a wireless network, you’re
going to have to do a small amount of work. It
takes only five minutes or so, but you can sleep
better tonight knowing that you’ve made some
effort to protect yourself. Your first step is to dig
out the user manual for your access point —
you know, it’s that little book that you ignored
that came with the access point. Find the sec-
tion on configuring the access point (each
brand is a little different). Then, be sure to
change the password (and user name if you
can). Next, change the SSID (the network name
of the access point). Don’t use a name that
easily identifies whose network this is. Turn on
the highest level of security that’s offered and
enter a key value that’s so difficult that you have
to write it down to remember it. You also have to
modify the settings on your iPAQ and any other
devices to match. These steps won’t keep out
crooks or governmental goons, but they at least
prevent the casual passersby from getting in.

Connecting to public hotspots
One of the really cool ways to use Wi-Fi is to connect to the Internet through
a public hotspot (a place where wireless Internet access is available) such as
those you might encounter in a coffee shop, a restaurant, or an airport. Just
whip out your iPAQ, turn it on, and you could be surfing the Web or handling
your e-mail. The wow factor when people see you pulling up Web sites with
no dangling wires is enough to start some awfully interesting conversations
with a whole bunch of perfect strangers.
Finding hotspots
You have to find the hotspots before you can connect to them. Many busi-
nesses are installing hotspots, so this probably won’t be too much of a 
problem — especially in large cities. Your iPAQ will even tell you when you’re
within range of a hotspot by popping up a message box. You do, however,
have to do a couple of things to make this happen:
 Your Wi-Fi radio must be on. iPAQs with built-in Wi-Fi radios default to
turning the radio off to save power, so you need to check this before you
go hotspot hunting.
 The Automatically Connect to Non-Preferred Networks option must be
selected (see “Adjusting the wireless configuration” earlier in this chap-
ter). If this is not selected, your iPAQ simply ignores most public hotspots.
 In most cases, you need to set up an account with the hotspot provider
before you can log on and use the Internet or e-mail. In some cases, this
requires setting up an account ahead of time, but increasingly, hotspots
allow you to enter your credit card information and sign up immediately.
 Finally, you must be within range of the hotspot. The range varies con-
siderably, but I have found that iPAQs tend to be able to connect further
from the hotspot than most Wi-Fi–equipped laptops.
Using pocketWiNc
Even though your iPAQ is pretty adept at finding and connecting to Wi-Fi
hotspots, you would probably be very surprised to see just how many con-
nection opportunities exist. Sure, your iPAQ will tell you about some of them,
but I have found a tool that makes your iPAQ into a top notch Wi-Fi finder. This
program, pocketWiNc, goes far beyond the ordinary and shows you every Wi-
Fi signal that it can detect. It even shows you which Wi-Fi networks are open
and available, and which ones require you to enter the proper security key to
connect. (See the nearby sidebar titled “Wi-Fi security considerations.”)
Figure 12-12 shows pocketWiNc in use. The top portion of the screen shows
all Wi-Fi access points that are currently detected by your iPAQ. The lower
portion of the screen shows the names of networks that you have connected
to recently. You can find out more about this great tool at the Cirond Web site
(www.cirond.com/site/products/wifispotter/download_software.htm).
205
Chapter 12: Connecting Your iPAQ

Extending the range of your Wi-Fi network
Have you ever tried to put a telephone or a small kitchen appliance in just
the right place only to find that the cord was just two inches too short to
reach the nearest outlet? If so, you can certainly understand how frustrating
it can be to set up your wireless network in your home office and then dis-
cover that your iPAQ doesn’t get quite the signal that it needs for a reliable
Wi-Fi connection in your family room.
Wi-Fi networks operate at a very high frequency — 2.4 GHz. They also trans-
mit signals at a very low power level. These two factors combine to limit the
ability of Wi-Fi signals to penetrate the walls in your home. As a result, a Wi-Fi
signal is actually usable over a much longer distance outdoors than indoors.
In fact, the difference is often four to ten times as much, depending on how
clear the path between the two Wi-Fi units is.
In some cases, you may be able to correct a marginal Wi-Fi signal situation by
moving your access point to a different location. For example, placing the
access point on top of a high cabinet rather than on your desk might do the
trick.
Figure 12-13 shows another option that works far better than moving your
access point. This is the 6dBi Desktop Directional Range Extender Indoor
Antenna from Pacific Wireless (www.pacwireless.com/html/apxtender.
html). To use this antenna, simply unscrew the little antenna from the back
Figure 12-12:
You can use
pocketWiNc
to snoop
around and

networks.
206
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

of your access point and connect the cable from the new antenna. Then place
the new antenna as high as possible and point it in the direction where you
would like to increase your Wi-Fi signal. In my testing, this compact little unit
effectively doubled the distance over which my iPAQ could make a reliable
connection to my network.
Working Remotely
If you have an iPAQ and a wireless connection, you have options that can get
you out of the office. By itself, that might be worth the cost of an iPAQ!
No one would claim that an iPAQ can do everything that a desktop PC can do.
However, with the options that I show you next, your iPAQ can do virtually
anything that your desktop PC can do.
Figure 12-14 shows something that probably looks a little familiar, yet not
something you’re used to seeing on your iPAQ: an ordinary Windows-based
PC and Windows Media Player. In this case, I’m controlling of one of the PCs
on my network — our home media center — by using NetOp Remote Control
(www.netop.com). You can download a trial version, but you’ll need to buy a
license if you want to continue using it after the trial period ends.

207
Chapter 12: Connecting Your iPAQ

NetOp Remote Control can do far more than simply show your desktop’s
screen on your iPAQ. Indeed, when NetOp Remote Control is running, you can
use anything on your desktop system with your iPAQ. You can run the pro-
grams on your desktop, change settings, and even perform file-management
functions.
It helps to use your imagination when you use a program like NetOp Remote
Control. Sure, the business applications for this type of program are obvious,
but you can have some fun with it, too. For example, you can use your 802.11b
wireless network connection to access your desktop system while you’re sit-
ting out in your backyard with your iPAQ. Then, you can play music through
your home stereo system that’s connected to your desktop system’s audio
card. Your iPAQ can control Windows Media Player and even adjust the
volume.
If you use NetOp Remote Control (or any other remote control software) to
allow remote access to your desktop PC, make certain that you activate the
security features included in the program. Otherwise, someone else might
be able to gain control of your desktop system and do all sorts of mischief.

 Using an alternative browser
E
ven though surfing the Web on your iPAQ will never be quite the same as
browsing with a huge desktop monitor, there’s a lot to be said for both
the convenience and sheer coolness of being able to whip out your iPAQ and
find something on the Web. While everyone else has to wait until they can fire
up their desktop PC, you’re able to go online whenever you want. That alone
is worth the price of admission, isn’t it?
In this chapter, you see how to use Pocket Internet Explorer on your iPAQ to
do some real Web browsing. In addition, I show you an alternative to Pocket
Internet Explorer that makes use of the entire iPAQ screen to present Web
pages in a whole new way. Whichever browser you choose, your iPAQ really
does function as a powerful and convenient way to access the Internet.
Introducing Pocket Internet Explorer
Pocket Internet Explorer is a Web browser designed for the small screen of
the iPAQ. A Web browser is a program that displays Web pages more or less
as the Web page designer intended. On your desktop PC, you probably use
Internet Explorer, Netscape, Mozilla, or Opera as your Web browser, but you
can’t run any of those on an iPAQ. Pocket Internet Explorer, of course, is simi-
lar to Internet Explorer, but these two programs have many differences.

Understanding the Pocket 
Internet Explorer screen
Figure 13-1 shows the Pocket Internet Explorer screen that you see the first
time you open Pocket Internet Explorer. You don’t need to be connected to
the Internet to see this screen because it’s stored right on your iPAQ. In fact,
you don’t need to connect at all until you actually want to visit a Web site.
Right off the bat, you probably notice that the Pocket Internet Explorer screen
looks quite different from any other Web browser that you’ve used in the past.
For one thing, it has far fewer buttons and toolbars cluttering up the screen.
Because Pocket Internet Explorer has far less room to waste, Web pages tend
to have a more compact appearance with less empty space between the vari-
ous bits and pieces. (Later in this chapter, in the section “Making the Best Use
of Your Screen Real Estate,” I show you how to maximize your viewing area.)
Even with a more compact view of Web pages, you still need to be able to move
around. Fortunately, if you’re familiar with Internet Explorer, you don’t need
to know anything new to navigate Web pages with Pocket Internet Explorer.
You can still click a link to load a different Web page. You can still use the
address bar to enter a URL (although you may have to choose View➪Address
Bar to display the address bar first because it’s often hidden to give you more
browsing room). And you can still scroll to other areas on a Web page by using
the scroll bars that appear when the Web page is too large for a single screen.
Figure 13-1:

210
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

You can also use the navigation button below the center of the iPAQ screen to
move around on a Web page.
Setting your general options
Pocket Internet Explorer has a number of options that you can set to control
how the program works. You may want to have a quick look at these options
before you actually begin browsing with Pocket Internet Explorer to be sure
that you understand exactly which options will work the best for you.
To begin setting the options, choose Tools➪Options to display the General
tab (see Figure 13-2).
Here’s a brief explanation of the options on the General tab:
 Home Page: These buttons enable you to choose a specific Web page to
view whenever you open Pocket Internet Explorer. Click Use Current if
you’re viewing a Web page that you want as your home page. Click Use
Default to reset your home page to the Web page shown in Figure 13-1.
Choosing a Web page that’s always available is a good idea. Because your
iPAQ isn’t likely to be connected to the Internet all the time, this means
choosing a Web page that’s stored on your iPAQ. Because the default Web
page is stored on your iPAQ, you don’t need to connect in order to view
the page. If you choose an online Web page, Pocket Internet Explorer
won’t be able to load the page unless your iPAQ is connected.
 History: These options enable you to control how long Pocket Internet
Explorer maintains a record of your browsing. The longer links remain in
the History list, the more likely you’ll be able to find the link when you
want to return to that neat page you remember visiting but can’t quite
remember the Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Of course, like with
most everything else on your iPAQ, use some moderation in choosing
how long to keep things in the history: Everything you store does eat up
some memory. (For more on the History list, see the section “Browsing
your History list” later in this chapter.)
 Temporary Internet Files: In this section, use the Delete Files button to
remove any Web pages and their associated files from temporary storage.
These files are stored so that you can more quickly reload a Web page
that you’ve visited recently.
 Delete Files and Clear History: If you’re really running low on memory,
click these buttons. Doing this typically doesn’t free up very much room,
but it may be enough to temporarily solve the problem.
211
Chapter 13: Surfing the Internet

Playing with the advanced options
To get to the Advanced tab, shown in Figure 13-3, choose Tools➪Options and
click the Advanced tab. Here you find some very useful options.
Here’s a quick look at the advanced settings:
 Cookies: These settings let you control those files that Web sites can
place onto your iPAQ when you visit a site. Some people hate the idea
that Web sites can use cookies to track some of your Web browsing
activity, but other people like the convenience that cookies provide —
such as the ability to shop online. Choose the cookie settings that make
you feel comfortable, and don’t forget the milk.
 Security settings: In this section, the Warn When Changing to a Page That
Is Not Secure option is very important on an iPAQ. On your desktop PC,
your browser provides visible feedback to tell you whether the Web page
that you’re visiting is secure. This makes it far safer for you to enter sensi-
tive information because you can easily tell if someone is asking you to
enter your credit card number on a page that isn’t encrypted. (If the site
isn’t encrypted, don’t enter any sensitive information.) However, on an
iPAQ it’s harder to tell if the page you’re visiting is secure — especially if
you’ve hidden the address bar to get more browsing area. That’s why it’s a
good idea to receive a warning when you go from a secure page to one
that isn’t secure.

 Language: This selection can be important if you visit a lot of foreign
language Web pages. You may need to play around with this setting to
see which selection does the best job of displaying the Web pages that
you visit.
Surfing the Connected Web
Okay, I’m sure that you want to stop this fooling around and start surfing! It’s
time to see what Web browsing on an iPAQ is really like.
To begin having fun on the Web, first click the Start button and choose
Internet Explorer. Most likely, you see the default home page shown earlier in
Figure 13-1, but you may see a different page instead if you’ve entered a new
home page. Figure 13-4 shows how Pocket Internet Explorer appears after an
online Web page has been loaded.
Entering URLs
A unique address, called a URL, identifies all Web sites. If you want to view
the Wiley Publishing Web site, for example, you can enter the address www.
wiley.com, and your Web browser finds and loads the page you’ve asked for.
Figure 13-3:

213
Chapter 13: Surfing the Internet

Like all Web browsers, Pocket Internet Explorer has an address bar that you
use to enter URLs. But unlike most other browsers, Pocket Internet Explorer
often has the address bar hidden so that you have a bit more space for view-
ing Web page content. When you want to enter an address, you first have to
display the address bar so that you have a place for the address.
To display the Pocket Internet Explorer address bar, choose View➪Address
Bar. This option is a toggle, like a light switch, so you use the same command
a second time to make the address bar go away again. Figure 13-5 shows
Pocket Internet Explorer after I’ve displayed the address bar, entered a URL,
and clicked the Go button (the curved green arrow to the right of the URL
box) to load a new page.
The small down arrow at the right side of the address bar displays a list of
URLs you’ve visited. To return to one of those Web sites, click the down
arrow and tap the URL of the site you want to visit.
Following links
Almost all Web pages include links that you can follow to visit other Web
pages. It is, in fact, those links that inspired the name Web in the first place.
The Web really is an endless web of links that lead here and there. Links are
also one of the most fun things about the Web. You never know where you’ll
eventually end up if you start following interesting-looking links. You might
even end up someplace like the Beer Church Home Page (www.beerchurch.
com) when you least expect it.

Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

Links can have several different appearances. You can usually tell which
words are links because they’re underlined and appear in a different color
from regular text. Tapping the underlined text moves you to the new page.
If you accidentally tap a link and find yourself on the wrong page, click the
Back button (the left-pointing arrow on the menu bar) to return to the previ-
ous page.
Going home
After you’ve followed a bunch of interesting-looking links, you may find your-
self wanting to return to your home page. When you get this urge, just click
the little house symbol on the Pocket Internet Explorer menu bar. Pocket
Internet Explorer reloads your home page. Too bad it can’t also make your
house payment while it’s at it.
Reloading pages
You have probably encountered Web pages that just don’t seem to load prop-
erly the first time. It’s really hard to pin down why this happens, but when it
does, your first action should probably be to tap the Reload button. Any time
Figure 13-5:
Use the
address bar
to enter
Web page
URLs.
215
Chapter 13: Surfing the Internet

you need to reload a Web page, click the Reload button (the button with the
two curved arrows in the middle of the Pocket Internet Explorer menu bar),
and Pocket Internet Explorer sends a new request for the page to the Web
server.
The Reload button helps in several different instances:
 If you’re trying to view images, but all you see are placeholders where
images belong on the Web page, hit the Reload button to ask for the
page and images to be sent again. (To find out how to stop images from
loading, see “Getting rid of graphics” later in this chapter.)
 If you’re viewing a Web page with frequently updated contents — such
as news headlines or stock prices — tap Reload to see an updated view.
 If you’re trying to access a Web site that won’t respond because too
many people are trying to view it at the same time, clicking the Reload
button may be all it takes to hit that small window of opportunity when
the server will actually respond and send you the page.
Viewing the page properties
Unless you’re really curious, there’s probably not much reason to view the
properties of the Web pages that you’re visiting. Still, you can find out a few
useful pieces of information by choosing View➪Properties. The Properties
screen appears, and here you can see the address (or URL) of the page that
you’re viewing and see whether it’s secure. Secure Web pages have a URL
that begins with https:// and non-secure pages begin with http://. You can
also verify which type of page you are viewing by noting what the Security
line just above the URL says.
Make certain that you’re on a secure Web page before you enter confidential
information like credit card numbers. Otherwise, you will send that informa-
tion across the Internet as plain text that anyone can intercept and read
along the way.
Sending a link
As you surf the Web, you’re bound to come across Web pages that you’d like
to share with someone else. Pocket Internet Explorer provides a very easy
way to do this by allowing you to send the URL in an e-mail message. The
recipient can then click the link and view the page.
To send a Web page link to someone, first make certain that you’re viewing
the page you want to send. Then choose Tools➪Send Link via E-mail to open
216
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

a new e-mail message. Address your message and include an explanation so
the recipient knows why you’re sending the link. Chapter 14 covers e-mail on
your iPAQ in more detail.
Pocket Internet Explorer doesn’t include an option for sending a complete
Web page to someone — you can send only the link to that page. And because
you can send only a link, the page may have changed or even disappeared
before your e-mail message recipient tries to view the page. If it’s important
that the recipient sees the same information that you’re seeing, you may want
to open Internet Explorer on your desktop PC and send the page — not just
the link — from there by choosing File➪Send➪Page by E-mail. Or you may
want to copy the information, which I discuss in the next section.
Copying information you want to keep
One thing that’s certain about the Web is that you can’t trust it to remain the
same. Pages are updated or can disappear without warning, and this can
mean that important information may not be there when you return. If you
want to preserve what you’ve seen on a Web page, the most reliable way to
do so is to save the page on your own computer.
Pocket Internet Explorer doesn’t offer you a way to save a Web page on your
iPAQ, so if you want to save the information from a site, you need to use a
slightly different approach. What you have to do is copy the information that
you want and then paste it into your own document. Remember, though, that
you may be violating someone’s copyright by copying the information. You
may need to ask the owner of the material for permission if you intend to use
it commercially or on a Web site.
To copy information from a Web page in Pocket Internet Explorer, follow
these steps:
1. Open the Web page that contains the information that you want to
preserve.
2. Drag your stylus across the information you want so that you select
the information. Alternatively, choose Tools➪Select All Text to select
all the text on the page.
Unfortunately, although you can save the text from a Web page, you
cannot save any images from the page.
3. Choose Tools➪Copy to copy the selected data to the Clipboard.
4. Open the document to which you want to add the information and
choose the Paste command.
You find the Paste command on an Edit menu, a Tools menu, or on some
other menu depending on the application that you’re using.
217
Chapter 13: Surfing the Internet

If you chose the Select All Text method of coping, you probably need to do a
bunch of cleanup to remove the junk that got pasted into your document
along with the stuff you wanted.
Browsing your History list
Pocket Internet Explorer keeps a record of the URLs of the Web pages you visit
so that it’s easier for you to return to those same pages. Consider how often
you’ve wanted to return to a site that you visited earlier, but you couldn’t quite
remember the correct URL. Maybe you visited the page a few days ago and just
now realized that it contained some information you really need. Well, the
History list can get you back there in no time.
To use the History list, choose View➪History. As Figure 13-6 shows, this dis-
plays a list that you can scroll through. You return to a page by tapping the
correct link.
You can view the URLs by tapping the down arrow to the right of Page Title
and selecting Address, which may be helpful if you want to return to the main
page on a Web site rather than to a page that you’ve already visited. This may
also help you locate the information you need if the page that you visited ear-
lier has disappeared.
Figure 13-6:
Use the
History list

Web pages

you don’t

the URL.
218
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

Playing favorites
Even though you can browse through your History list to find links to Web
pages that you’ve visited, the History list is not the most ideal way to store
links to Web pages that you want to visit in the future. Not only do links dis-
appear from the History list after a certain period of time, but all the History
list links can be instantly cleared away with a tap of your stylus.
Pocket Internet Explorer provides a better way to store the Web page links
that you really don’t want to lose. You save them as favorites and they remain
available until you decide to get rid of them.
Viewing your favorite Web sites
To return to your favorite Web sites, you use the Favorites list instead of the
History list. Figure 13-7 shows the Favorites list. To display this list, tap the
Favorites button — the button that looks like a star — at the right side of the
Pocket Internet Explorer menu bar.
Saving favorite Web sites
So how do your favorite Web sites magically get placed onto your Favorites
list? Simple: You put them there by using the Add/Delete tab (see Figure 13-8).
Figure 13-7:
Use the
Favorites list
to quickly
return to
your favorite
Web sites.
219
Chapter 13: Surfing the Internet

When you arrive at the Favorites screen, it asks which items you want to
delete. On the Add/Delete tab, deleting is the default activity. To add a Web
site to the list, you’ve got to do just a bit more:
1. Open the Web page that you want to add to your list of favorites.
2. Tap the Favorites button.
3. Tap the Add/Delete tab.
4. Click the Add button.
5. If you want, modify the page name in the Name text box to something
more descriptive.
6. Click Add and then tap OK to close the Favorites screen.
If you’re having a hard time figuring out which Web sites to add to your list of
Favorites, here are some ideas:
 Include the logon page for your online stockbroker. That way, you’re can
quickly access your account and make those trades as soon as you hear
some interesting news.
 If you travel often, add the online ticket reservation sites for your favorite
airlines. If you have a wireless connection, you can quickly book a flight if
you find that you need to change your schedule at the last minute.
Figure 13-8:
Add your

220
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

 Add a weather forecasting site if you’d like to see whether it’s a better idea
to fly off to the mountains for skiing or to the coast for some sunshine.
 Of course, you want to include www.dummies.com so that you can find
out when your favorite author comes out with a new title. You wouldn’t
want your collection to be incomplete, would you?
Offline Pocket Browsing
Connecting to the Internet may not always be practical, but that shouldn’t keep
you from viewing Web pages that contain interesting or useful information. You
may, for example, want to catch up on the weather forecast or some local news
stories while you’re riding to work in your car pool even though everyone else
just wants to listen to a talk show or the sports. You could, of course, use a
wireless Internet connection if you have one available, but there’s no reason
why you can’t do a little browsing even when you can’t connect.
The key to offline browsing on your iPAQ is ActiveSync. By using this tool,
you can set up your desktop PC to automatically download certain Web
pages to your iPAQ so that you can view them when it’s convenient for you.
To do so, choose Tools➪Create Mobile Favorite on your desktop PC. Then,
use the Options command in ActiveSync and select Favorites. That way, your
iPAQ has your weather, news, or whatever you want all ready when you grab
it on your way out the door in the morning.
Making the Best Use of 
Your Screen Real Estate
I doubt that anyone complains that the screen on the iPAQ is too large. When
you’re viewing Web pages in Pocket Internet Explorer, it’s pretty clear that Web
site designers aren’t giving too much thought to how their pages look on the
iPAQ’s screen. You’ve got to make the most of a small area, and fortunately
Pocket Internet Explorer has a few tricks up its sleeve to help you out.
Getting rid of graphics
One thing that you can do to fit more text onto your iPAQ’s screen is to choose
to not display the graphics that appear on most Web pages. After all, do you
really want to view all those banner ads? You can turn off the graphics by tap-
ping the View➪Show Images command in Pocket Internet Explorer. Another
plus: Your Web pages load faster because you aren’t downloading any images.
You can tap the button again to redisplay the graphics.
221
Chapter 13: Surfing the Internet

Expanding the usable screen area
Even if you want to see the images on Web pages, you can still make better
use of the little bit of screen that you’ve got. Choose View and then use the
following options:
 Fit to Screen: Choose this option to make Pocket Internet Explorer
scrunch things together by reducing wasted space. When you select this
option, you won’t need to scroll nearly so much because Pocket Internet
Explorer uses as little space as possible to display the Web page contents.
 Address Bar: Choose this option only when you need to enter a URL,
and then deselect this option after you’ve loaded the Web page. The
address bar is necessary only while you’re entering an address, and
hiding the address bar gives you a touch more room for viewing Web
pages.
 Text Size: This option is for choosing the size of the characters used to
display Web pages. Selecting a smaller size fits more onto the screen at
one time, but if you go too small, you may need to get stronger reading
glasses. Of course, you can choose a larger text size if you have trouble
reading the text, too.
Browsing the Web on your iPAQ can be a lot of fun — whether it’s online or
offline browsing. Your iPAQ certainly makes it possible to surf the Web at
times and places where doing so would otherwise be impossible.
Using an Alternative Browser
It isn’t hard to argue that surfing the Web with Pocket Internet Explorer can
be somewhat frustrating. Here are just a few reasons why this is so:
 Most Web pages are designed for viewing on a screen that is wider than
it is high. The iPAQ screen, of course, is just the opposite.
 Even when you eliminate the address bar, a large portion of what little
space is available is eaten up by the title bar and the menu bar — items
you can’t remove.
 No matter what you do, most Web pages require so much scrolling —
both horizontally and vertically — that it can be a real chore to find the
things you really want on the iPAQ’s screen.
Figure 13-9 shows the ThunderHawk Web Browser. This browser is designed
to address these issues and make your iPAQ browsing a much more enjoy-
able experience.
222
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

One of the first things you may notice about the ThunderHawk browser is that
it uses a landscape layout so that it can display Web pages in a format similar
to that of a desktop Web browser. When you’re using ThunderHawk, you need
to turn your iPAQ on its side to view the screen. In addition, except for a very
small scrollbar, the entire iPAQ screen is used to display Web page content.
The title bar, menu bar, and address bar aren’t there to spoil the view.
You may be wondering about just how useful a Web browser without an
address bar or any other visible controls really is. Well, rest assured that the
ThunderHawk browser does have the missing controls, but it only displays
them when necessary. Figure 13-10 shows how the controls are displayed
when you press any of the program buttons on the front of your iPAQ. (The
navigation button is used for navigation rather than displaying the controls.)

223
Chapter 13: Surfing the Internet

Another area where the ThunderHawk browser differs from Pocket Internet
Explorer is that the ThunderHawk browser is sold on a subscription basis. You
can, however, download a 30-day trial version so that you can see if Thunder-
Hawk is really for you. You can find out everything you need to know about
this browser at the Bitstream Web site (www.bitstream.com/wireless/
getthnow.html).
Be sure to try out the 30-day trial version before signing up for a ThunderHawk
subscription. During testing for this book, I was unable to get ThunderHawk to
work on a newly released iPAQ model (although the manufacturer advised that
this support would likely be available in the near future).

Keeping Track of Your E-Mail
In This Chapter
 Setting up your e-mail account
 Creating and sending messages
 Synchronizing messages with your desktop PC
A
nyone who gets too few e-mail messages just isn’t trying hard enough.
These days, virtually everyone wants your e-mail address, and few of us
can remember what life was like back when you had to pick up a phone if you
wanted to quickly communicate.
Your iPAQ is especially well-suited to helping you manage your e-mail. Its size
is small enough that you can carry it with you anywhere — so you can deal
with e-mail messages when you would otherwise be wasting time waiting for
something else to happen. It’s also convenient because you can whip out a
message when a thought hits rather than waiting until you’re back at your
desk. And because your iPAQ can share e-mail messages with your desktop
PC, you don’t have to stay late at the office to handle that rush of messages
that arrived just before quitting time.
Connecting to Your Mail Server
E-mail messages circulate over the Internet in much the same manner that
letters travel through the postal system. E-mail moves a lot faster than ordi-
nary mail, of course, but the two methods have certain similarities. First, like
letters, all e-mail messages need to be sent to a specific, unique address. In
addition, e-mail messages travel through mail servers — the electronic equiv-
alent of post offices. Just as it’s necessary for the post office to know that
you’ve built a house and are now living at a particular street address, it’s also
necessary for you to establish your e-mail address with a mail server.
Sending and receiving e-mail messages with your iPAQ requires that you first
set up your iPAQ with the proper mail server and address information. You
can get started by setting up and configuring your iPAQ to use e-mail.

Setting up your e-mail account
You probably want to set up your iPAQ to use the same e-mail account as
your desktop PC so that you can more easily share e-mail between the two.
This isn’t required, of course. If you want, you can set up an e-mail account
specifically for your iPAQ — but I leave it to you to figure out how you’re
going to keep track of more than one e-mail account (and how to deal with
twice as much spam).
You can use two basic types of e-mail with your iPAQ: online and offline. Online
(Web-based) e-mail services typically require that you read, compose, and
send messages while you’re online and using a Web browser. Your Internet ser-
vice provider (ISP) probably also provides you with a more traditional e-mail
account that enables you to handle your e-mail offline. Offline (non-Web-based)
e-mail servers are also known as IMAP4 or POP3 mail servers, depending on
the particular mail protocol they use. You have to select the correct mail
server type when you’re setting up e-mail on your iPAQ, but it should be quite
easy to get the server type from your ISP.
To set up your e-mail account on your iPAQ, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start button and choose Inbox to run the program (or choose
Inbox from the Programs folder if it does not appear on your Start
menu).
2. Choose Accounts➪New Account to display the E-mail Address screen,
shown in Figure 14-1.
Figure 14-1:
Enter your
e-mail
address.
226
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

3. Enter your e-mail address in the text box.
4. Tap Next to display the Auto Configuration screen, shown in Figure 14-2.
At this point, your iPAQ attempts to connect and configure itself cor-
rectly. Wait until the Status box says Completed before continuing.
5. Click Next to display the User Information screen, shown in Figure 14-3.
6. Enter your user name and your password in the text boxes if you 
want your iPAQ to be able to send and receive e-mail automatically.
If you either skip the password or don’t enable the Save Password
option, you have to enter the information manually each time you want
to access the mail server.
7. Click Next to display the Account Information screen, shown in 
Figure 14-4.
8. In the Account Type drop-down list box, select the type of mail server
that your ISP provides.
In most cases, the default POP3 is the correct choice.
9. Enter a name for this mail service in the Name text box.
10. Tap Next to display the Server Information screen, shown in Figure 14-5.
11. If the server names are not filled in, enter the correct names that
were supplied by your ISP.

Make sure that the Outgoing E-Mail Server Requires Authentication
option is correctly enabled or disabled for your iPAQ — otherwise you
will be able to receive but not send e-mail from your iPAQ. Your ISP
should give you the proper information.
16. Tap Next to display the final Options screen, shown in Figure 14-8.
You might want to only download the message headers (which contain
information such as who sent the message and the subject) or you might
want to limit the download to a certain size (such as 2K). This would be
especially true if you use a wireless connection where you are charged
by the amount of data that’s transferred or if your Inbox tends to be
swamped by spam. You could later download the entire message to your
desktop system.
17. Tap Finish to complete the setup.
Congratulations! You’re now the proud parent of a brand new e-mail account.

Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

Choosing your message options
Before you begin using a new mail service, at least review the message
options that are selected for the mail service so you can be sure that Pocket
Inbox is handling mail the way you prefer.
To check the message options, open Pocket Inbox and choose Tools➪
Options. Then, click the Message tab (see Figure 14-9).
Here’s a brief description of these options:
 When Replying, Include Body: Use this option to include the original
message when you send a reply to someone. If you don’t select this
option, people could have a very hard time remembering which message
you’re replying to.
When you include the original message in your reply, cut down the clut-
ter by deleting those parts of the original that aren’t needed to convey
the message.
 Indent and Add Leading Character: If you include the body text in
replies, make certain that both of these boxes are selected. Using these
options makes it easier for the recipient to recognize the text that you’re
replying to. Don’t try to get fancy with the leading character, though.
Everyone recognizes the greater than (>) symbol as signifying a reply. If
you decide to use a different character, you’ll only confuse people.
Figure 14-8:

231
Chapter 14: Keeping Track of Your E-Mail

 Keep Copy of Sent Mail in Sent Folder: Enable this option if you want to
keep a record of messages that you send. It’s tempting to try and save
storage space by not selecting this option, but then you won’t have any
way to determine if you’ve actually sent a message or simply thought
you should and then forgot.
 After Deleting or Moving a Message: Select an option from this drop-down
list to determine how you want Inbox to respond when you’re finished
with a message. You may need to experiment with the three possibilities to
see which one fits your way of working.
 Empty Deleted Items: Finally, use the selections in this drop-down list to
tell Inbox what to do with messages that you delete.
Getting e-mail addresses
Chapter 6 helps you play around with the iPAQ address book to add contact
information for the people you deal with. Now that you’re about to use e-mail
on your iPAQ, you begin reaping the benefits from those efforts.
Pocket Inbox can use the e-mail addresses contained in your contacts list. It
can also use online address books to verify e-mail addresses. To control how
these options work, open Pocket Inbox and choose Tools➪Options to display
the Options screen, and then click the Address tab, as shown in Figure 14-10.
Figure 14-9:
Set the
message
options the
way you
want them.
232
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

Use the In Contacts, Get Address From drop-down list to determine which
fields in the contacts list to use for e-mail addresses when you enter a name
rather than an e-mail address. In most cases, this doesn’t matter because 
the majority of your message recipients probably each use one main e-mail
address. This can make a difference if you regularly send e-mail to a group 
of people who each have separate home and work e-mail addresses. In that
case, you can use one e-mail address field for their home address and a differ-
ent one for each person’s work address.
If you use your iPAQ only to read and compose e-mail messages, and then use
ActiveSync to transfer those messages to Outlook on your desktop PC for
sending, make certain that you don’t select a mail server for verifying e-mail
addresses on your iPAQ. (Refer to Figure 14-10.) If you do select this option,
your iPAQ may lock up when it searches for the mail server and can’t find it.
For information on using ActiveSync, you may want to refer to Chapter 5.
Setting your message storage location
If you have a memory storage card for your iPAQ, you can use the storage
card to store any messages and any attachments. To select this option,
choose Tools➪Options to display the Options screen, and then click the
Storage tab (shown in Figure 14-11). Enable the Store Attachments on Storage
Card check box.

Chapter 14: Keeping Track of Your E-Mail

Sending and Receiving E-Mail
E-mail was really one of the great inventions of the computing age. E-mail made
it possible to send a quick message at any time and to have that message deliv-
ered almost instantly. And unlike other forms of communication, e-mail is also
cheap and has the ability to bridge time differences between people anywhere
in the world. You can send a message to your friend half way around the world
when it’s convenient for you, and you don’t have to worry about waking them
with an expensive phone call. They, of course, can respond when they’re 
available — whether that’s right now or hours from now.
Your iPAQ has the ability to make e-mail even more convenient. Now you can
use e-mail almost anywhere and at any time.
Creating a message
Creating an e-mail message is a very simple process. It’s almost the same as
writing out a quick note except that, in an e-mail message, you need to add
the recipient’s address and a subject line.
To create an e-mail message, choose New on the Pocket Inbox menu bar. This
opens a blank message form like the one I’m using in Figure 14-12. Then,
follow these steps:
Figure 14-11:
You can

234
Part IV: The iPAQ and the Internet 

1. Tap the double down arrows to the right of the subject line to display
the Cc, Bcc, and Account fields in addition to the To and Subj fields. 
You can hide the extra fields by tapping the double up arrows. The Cc
field enables you to send a copy of your message to an additional recipi-
ent without making them the primary recipient. Use the Account field to
choose the method for sending the message.
The Bcc (blind carbon copy) field is a really handy tool. People you 
list only in the Bcc field get the message, but their names and e-mail
addresses don’t appear on anyone’s copy of the message. You can use
this to great advantage if you need to send the same message separately
to a whole bunch of people, because no one knows who else was listed in
the Bcc field of the message, and therefore they don’t know who else got
the message. The Bcc field offers two other advantages, too. If you print
an e-mail message, the message header normally prints at the top of the
message, and the header contains a list of the recipients. By using the
Bcc field for most recipients, you reduce the amount of paper needed to
print the message. Also, by using the Bcc field, you eliminate the problem
of someone responding by clicking the Reply All button; because no
recipients are shown, you’re the only person who gets the reply.
2. Enter the name of the recipient or his e-mail address in the To field.
You can click To if you want to select the message recipients from your
address list. If you click To, you see a screen where you can select from
only those people in your address list who have e-mail addresses.
Figure 14-12:
Enter your

235
Chapter 14: Keeping Track of Your E-Mail

3. Use the Subj line to briefly describe your message. When you tap the
< . . . >, you can enter the subject text, which replaces the < . . . > as
you type.
Coming up with a good subject line can be a real art because you want
to distill your meaning down to just a few words. The message recipient
needs to be able to grasp how important the message is just from seeing
the first few words of the subject line — long subject lines probably
can’t display completely in his or her Inbox.
4. After you’ve finished composing your message, click the Send button
to place the message into your Outbox folder.
Items in the Outbox folder go out the next time the mail server is 
contacted.
Sending and receiving messages
If you configured Pocket Inbox to automatically send and receive e-mail, you
don’t have to do anything special to send the messages from your Outbox.
Those messages go out and any new messages are received as soon as your
iPAQ connects to the mail server.
You can, however, tell your iPAQ to send and receive messages immediately
by clicking the Send/Receive button (the button with two envelopes at the
right side of the Inbox menu bar). Depending on your settings, you may need
to connect to the Internet manually, and you may need to enter your mail
server’s user name and password.
Organizing messages in folders
By default, Pocket Inbox creates several folders for organizing your e-mail
messages. Figure 14-13 shows the typical array of folders that you see if you
click the view list just below the title bar. (In the figure, the title of the list is
Show because I am deciding what I want to show — normally, it shows the
name of the selected folder.)
Getting the entire story
If you want to get a quick overview of the status of your messages, simply
choose Tools➪Status. As Figure 14-14 shows, you can easily see what needs
to be done.

Don’t depend on the Message Status screen to tell you if you have any incom-
ing messages waiting to be retrieved. Inbox has no way to determine if you
have any incoming messages until you actually connect to the mail server.

Chapter 14: Keeping Track of Your E-Mail

Exchanging Messages with Outlook
Just as you can use your iPAQ for offline browsing when you’re not con-
nected to the Internet, you can use your iPAQ for offline e-mail. In both cases,
the key component is ActiveSync, because ActiveSync allows your iPAQ and
your desktop PC to share important information in a controlled manner.
Because you need to use Outlook on your desktop PC to share e-mail with
your iPAQ, the HP iPAQ Companion CD-ROM includes a full version of Outlook
2002. If you have not already installed Outlook 2002 (or later), you need to get
out your HP iPAQ Companion CD-ROM and do so before you can continue.
After you install Outlook on your desktop PC, you can share e-mail messages
between your iPAQ and your desktop PC by selecting the Inbox option in
ActiveSync. To do so, open ActiveSync and click the Options button to open
the Options screen. Then, make certain that the Inbox check box is selected.
If you like, you can click the Settings button for more precise control over the
way e-mail is shared.
You can share e-mail only between your iPAQ and one desktop PC. If you use
two different desktop PCs, carefully choose one for sharing e-mail messages
because you can use only that one desktop PC.

T
hese days, it seems like every store is trying to sell you one of those
single-purpose, pocket-sized music players. Well, you can save your
money because your iPAQ can easily master that little task — and even
throws in a bunch of extras that those other boxes simply can’t match. This
chapter shows you how to do it all and make those iPod users wish they had
iPAQs in their pockets!
Using Windows Media Player
Your iPAQ uses a special version of Windows Media Player to play music and
other multimedia files. You can also use Windows Media Player on your desk-
top PC to create music files for use on your iPAQ and then to transfer them to
your iPAQ.
If you haven’t already, be sure to upgrade the Windows Media Player on your
desktop PC to the latest version. This ensures that you have the best possi-
ble version for preparing music to share with your iPAQ. Just open Windows
Media Player by clicking the Windows Media Player icon on your desktop or
Quick Launch toolbar, and then choose Help➪Check For Player Updates to
see if any free updates are available.
Copying music illegally can get you into a heap of trouble. Recording compa-
nies and artists quite rightly wish to protect their property by enforcing their
rights under copyright laws. These laws generally prohibit you from making
copies of music and then selling, trading, or giving away those copies. Making

a copy of music that you own — such as a purchased audio CD — for your
own private use on a device such as your iPAQ is generally considered
acceptable. Unfortunately, no one really knows what the courts may decide
tomorrow, so be very careful when it comes to copying any music, no matter
what the source or reason.
Transferring music to your iPAQ
Audio CDs are a great medium for distributing music. They’re relatively small,
fairly immune to casual damage, and they produce very high-quality sound.
But unless you’ve got awfully big pockets, audio CDs aren’t all that great as a
portable music source. Not only are they too big, but they’re also prone to
skipping — even when played in really good portable CD players.
Audio CDs hold uncompressed sound recordings, which means that a com-
plete recording can use up to 700MB of space. Your iPAQ, of course, probably
has nowhere near that much storage room. Windows Media Player can com-
press audio tracks to a fraction of their original size. Some sound quality is
lost when compressing an audio track, but you don’t notice the difference
when listening to music on your iPAQ. But even with compression, you likely
don’t want to copy an entire audio CD to your iPAQ unless you add a memory
storage card. See “Expanding your iPAQ’s Musical Capabilities” later in this
chapter for more information.
You may have to connect your iPAQ to your desktop PC by using the sync
cable (see Chapter 5) in order for Windows Media Player to detect your iPAQ.
To copy music from an audio CD to your iPAQ, follow these steps:
1. Open Windows Media Player on your desktop PC.
2. Insert the audio CD into your CD drive.
3. Click the Copy from CD button on the left side of the screen to display
the tracks on the audio CD.
If you have an Internet connection, Windows Media Player attempts to
obtain the track information from a music database located on the
Internet.
Figure 15-1 shows how the Windows Media Player appears when it’s
ready to begin copying the tracks.
4. Make sure that the tracks you want are checked. Then, click the Copy
Music button to first copy them to your desktop’s hard drive.
5. Click the Copy to CD or Device button on the left side of the screen.
242
Part V: Multimedia Time 

Windows Media Player examines your iPAQ to see how much space is
available and then displays the music files in the currently open media
library as well as the music files on your iPAQ. Note that Windows Media
Player compresses the music files as it copies them to your iPAQ so that
more music fits into the available space.
6. Select the tracks that you want to copy to your iPAQ and then click the
Copy button. Figure 15-2 shows how this process appears as files are
being copied.

Creating a play list
After you have copied the music files onto your iPAQ, you can create a play
list by selecting the music that you want to hear. If you have enough storage
to store several different complete audio CDs on your iPAQ, you may even
want to create several different play lists.
To set up a play list, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start button on your iPAQ and choose Windows Media from
the Start menu on your iPAQ.
2. Choose Playlist on the menu bar, and then tap the plus sign (+) at the
far lower-left side of the toolbar to display the list of songs.
3. Select the songs that you want to include (see Figure 15-3), and then
click OK.
In this case, I want to include several of the songs and I tapped the 
information icon at the lower-left to view information about the current
selection.
4. Tap OK.

Part V: Multimedia Time 

Playing your music
After you set up your play list, you can listen to the music. Figure 15-4 shows
the Windows Media Player in action.
To hear the recording in stereo, use headphones. You can also play back the
music through a set of small battery-powered amplified speakers like the
ones often used with desktop PCs.
Music playback can be a major drain on your iPAQ’s battery. Be sure that
you’re starting out with a fully charged battery and that you’ve turned off the
backlight on your iPAQ. 
If you’re using headphones, look for a small R on one earpiece and a small L
on the other. That way you can be certain that the right and left channels are
playing in the correct ear.

Chapter 15: Using Your iPAQ for Music

Setting the Windows Media Player options
You can make your iPAQ more convenient as a music player by customizing
the buttons on the front of your iPAQ so that they have special functions for
playing music. You don’t have to worry about screwing up the normal opera-
tion of your iPAQ — the buttons assume their special functions only when
Windows Media Player is open.
To set up these special functions, open Windows Media Player and choose
Tools➪Settings➪Buttons, which displays the Options screen shown in 
Figure 15-5.
To assign a function to one of the buttons, first choose the function from the
drop-down list. Then, press the button that you want to use for the function.
You can remove an assigned function from a button by selecting <Un-map>
from the drop-down list and then pressing the button. Tap OK when you’re
finished.
Because Windows Media Player continues to play in the background when you
switch to another application on your iPAQ, it’s best not to select the Un-Map
Buttons During Background Play check box because doing so makes it harder
for you to control Windows Media Player when it plays in the background.

Part V: Multimedia Time 

Expanding Your iPAQ’s 
Musical Capabilities
The iPAQ is easily expanded to provide even more music playback capabilities.
I take a quick look at a couple of options that you may find quite interesting.
Adding storage space
You may have noticed that my iPAQ had lots of room for storing music. (Refer
to Figure 15-2.) One of the problems with using an iPAQ as a portable music
player is that it doesn’t have much room for music files in the standard stor-
age space that comes built into an iPAQ. Fortunately, it’s easy to expand your
iPAQ’s capacity by using a memory storage card. In my case, I added a 256MB
Secure Digital (SD) memory card from SanDisk (www.sandisk.com) to allow
my iPAQ to store several hours of music. You can also find excellent memory
cards from SimpleTech (www.simpletech.com).
Internet radio for Wi-Fi users
If you have a Wi-Fi connection for your iPAQ, a whole new world is literally open
to you — Internet radio. Stations all over the world now broadcast over the
Internet, and iPAQs using the Windows Mobile 2003 operating system can let
you listen to them by using Windows Media Player. If you can’t find something
interesting to listen to with the whole world available to you, you probably
aren’t trying.
To find live Internet radio stations, you use Pocket Internet Explorer (see
Chapter 13). For example, Figure 15-6 shows the live stream selection avail-
able at DeutschlandRadio (www.dradio.de).
I generally find that it’s easier to locate my favorite Internet radio by using
the radio tuner feature in Windows Media Player on my desktop PC. The
Windows Media Player on the iPAQ doesn’t offer this feature, but when
you’ve located the correct URL on your desktop, it’s easy to enter that same
URL on your iPAQ.
247
Chapter 15: Using Your iPAQ for Music

Figure 15-7 shows how Windows Media Player appears when playing a live
stream from an Internet radio station. Although you cannot tell from the
figure, the station, Deutschlandfunk, was playing “We’re Men in Tights” from
the famous Mel Brooks movie, thus making it nearly impossible to complete
this chapter because I was laughing so hard.

Part V: Multimedia Time 

After you find some Internet radio stations that you enjoy, choose Tools➪Add
Web Favorite in Windows Media Player to save the URLs of those stations on
your iPAQ. You can then use the Playlist command to open the same station
in the future without going through Pocket Internet Explorer.
Conduits Pocket Player
Windows Media Player isn’t your only option for playing music on your iPAQ.
Figure 15-8 shows the Conduits Pocket Player (www.conduits.com), which you
may want to consider getting — especially if you want some cool features like
visualizations and a graphic equalizer. Visualizations are graphics that display
to visually represent the sounds that are playing, and the graphic equalizer
allows you to tailor the frequency response precisely during playback.
Conduits Pocket Player offers full support for the new Ogg Vorbis music file
format — a feature that you can’t find in Windows Media Player.
When you’re playing MP3 or Ogg Vorbis music files, Conduits Pocket Player
offers the option of displaying a graphic equalizer so that you can adjust the
characteristics of the sound playback. For example, you might want to boost
the mid frequencies to make vocals easier to understand or you might want
to pump up the bass to compensate for the limited low frequency capabilities
of most ear bud headsets.

A
lthough playing music may seem like the most obvious way to use mul-
timedia content on your iPAQ, that’s clearly not the limit of what your
iPAQ can do. In fact, as this chapter shows, your iPAQ is an excellent video
content delivery machine, too. You can display and edit digital photos, watch
movies and other types of video, and you can even let your iPAQ replace a
bunch of heavy books.
Working with Photos
If you’ve got a digital camera in addition to your iPAQ, you’ve probably given
some thought to using the two devices as partners. After all, your iPAQ is a
computer, and digital images are in their natural element on a computer. Why
not use your iPAQ to put those finishing touches on your digital images?
Sharing photos with your digital camera
In order to work with digital images on your iPAQ, you first have to move those
images from your digital camera to your iPAQ. This can be very simple in some
cases and very difficult in others — depending on a number of hardware and
software factors that I show you in the following sections. For example, in some
cases you may be able to simply share a memory storage card, but in others
you may even need to bring your desktop PC into the act between your iPAQ
and your digital camera.

Most digital cameras store images in JPEG, BMP, or TIFF file format. Of these,
JPEG is often the best to work with on an iPAQ if for no better reason than the
fact that JPEG images are generally compressed — they take less storage
space.
Sharing digital images on memory cards
The most straightforward method of sharing digital images between your dig-
ital camera and your iPAQ is to use a memory card that’s compatible with
both units. If this is an option, you can typically just pop the memory card
out of the camera, plug it into your iPAQ, and you’re ready to go — almost.
Your iPAQ generally needs a bit of help finding files that are stored on a
memory card if those files aren’t stored in a folder called My Documents.
Digital cameras, of course, typically have little (if any) need for folders, so
they often store image files on the memory card without using any directory
structure. Therefore, you may need to explicitly tell whatever software you’re
using on your iPAQ to look on the memory card for image files because they
won’t be stored in the iPAQ’s preferred location.
Of course, life is often more complicated than we may like. Not all digital cam-
eras use iPAQ-compatible memory cards. Even those that do may not be able
to handle a memory card that has as much capacity as the ones that you can
use in your iPAQ.
If you want to share memory cards between a digital camera and an iPAQ,
you may want to spend some time researching memory card compatibility
before you buy a digital camera. Then, get a camera that uses the same
memory cards as your iPAQ. Of course, if you already bought that digital
camera, you may just get lucky and find out that it can use the same memory
cards as your iPAQ.
252
Part V: Multimedia Time 
What’s on your iPAQ?
As you may have guessed, different iPAQ
models come with different image viewing
applications — or none at all. In fact, the h1900
series lacks several applications that are
included with the other models, and the h2200
series and h4100 series share one application
(Pictures) but have a different second one (iPAQ
Image Viewer versus iPAQ Image Zone). It also
appears that Hewlett-Packard may even be
changing the set of standard applications
depending on when a particular iPAQ was built.
This confusing situation means that it really isn’t
possible to provide meaningful coverage of the
graphics programs that may or may not be
included with each iPAQ.
To make things easier on you, I show you a
couple of third-party programs that run on any
iPAQ model and that offer far more capabilities
than any of the built-in applications that
Hewlett-Packard provides. These programs are
useful no matter which iPAQ you use.

Connecting to your digital camera
The one foolproof method of transferring image files from your digital camera
to your iPAQ is to first transfer them from your digital camera to your desk-
top PC. You can use the software that came with your digital camera to do
this. Then, use ActiveSync to send those files to your iPAQ.
Editing photos on your iPAQ
You aren’t going to find highly sophisticated photo-editing software bundled
with your iPAQ — no matter which model you have. Fortunately, though, you
can easily correct this problem by adding an inexpensive piece of software to
your iPAQ.
Downloading and installing new software on your iPAQ is pretty simple, but
it’s a subject that I in detail in this chapter. If you want to try out the software
shown in this chapter, you may want to hold off until you’ve had a chance to
read Chapter 18 (or you can skip ahead, of course).
Realize that no matter how good the software is, your iPAQ is far more suited
to fairly simple image-editing tasks than it is to professional-level photo
manipulation. Graphic artists have a good reason to use desktop PCs with
large monitors: Editing photos is easier when you can see more detail, and
the iPAQ’s screen is too small to show much detail.
Of course, digital photo editing is a subject that can easily take up several
complete books. Rather than try to cover the topic badly in a few pages, I’m
simply going to show you one of the tools that’s available for the iPAQ so that
you can get an idea of the possibilities.
The tool that I’ve selected is Pocket Artist from Conduits Technologies. You
can download a trial version from www.conduits.com. Figure 16-1 shows an
example of the items that are available when you choose Pocket Artist
Menu➪Tools.
When you take photos with your digital camera, some adjustment of the
brightness, contrast, or colors can often really improve the images. As 
Figure 16-1 shows, Pocket Artist gives you easy access to these adjustments.
If you want to go beyond basic adjustments and get creative, Pocket Artist
provides tools to help there, too. For example, Figure 16-2 shows the list of
tools that appear when you tap the Paintbrush icon on the toolbar.

No matter where you manipulate images — on your iPAQ or on your desktop
PC — working with a copy of important files rather than with the original is
always a good idea. When editing an image, you can easily go too far and then
want to go back several steps. Working with a copy is the safest way to
ensure that you can always go back to the original.
Displaying your photos
If you’ve ever tried to show people the digital photos that you’ve taken, and
tried to use the display screen on your digital camera to do so, you know
how difficult and frustrating that can be. Not only is the screen too small for
good viewing, but cycling through the images usually requires pressing the
right buttons.
One alternative is to use your iPAQ and create a slideshow of your images.
ACDSee Mobile (www.acdsystems.com) can easily do this, and as Figure 16-3
shows, it can also display zoomed views of the images on your iPAQ.
ACDSee Mobile is one of the few iPAQ applications that can display TIFF
images.

Video on Your iPAQ
You may be surprised to discover just how capable your iPAQ is at playing
video content. In most cases, you don’t even need anything beyond the soft-
ware that’s already installed, and you can watch streaming content from the
Internet, videos that you’ve created, or even TV shows that you’ve recorded
on your desktop PC.
Streaming video from the Internet
If you have a Wi-Fi connection, you can watch streaming video from various Web
sites that offer video content. Figure 16-4 shows an example of the movie trailer
for Pirates of the Caribbean playing in Windows Media Player on an iPAQ. This
example was from the Windows Media Mobile Web site (windowsmediamobile.
theplatform.com).
To view video full screen on your iPAQ, choose Tools➪Settings➪Audio &
Video in Windows Media Player. Then, select your preferred setting from the
Play Video in Full Screen drop-down list.

Creating your own movies
Finding streaming video on the Web is still a bit difficult, but you can use the
free Windows Movie Maker (version 2 or later) to create video to play on
your iPAQ. This might be an excellent option if you’re taking a long flight on
one of those budget airlines whose only customer amenities are six-month-
old, dog-eared magazines. You can use Windows Movie Maker to make highly
compressed copies of your favorite movies and then store them on a Secure
Digital (SD) memory card. Figure 16-5 shows one of my home movies playing
on my iPAQ after being converted to Pocket PC format by using Windows
Movie Maker.
Although I don’t have room here to show you how to use Windows Movie
Maker, I must mention one setting that’s very important when producing a
movie for use on your iPAQ. When you reach Step 3 in Windows Movie Maker
and click the Save to My Computer to Launch the Save Movie Wizard button,
select Other settings on the second wizard screen. Then, you can select one
of three settings specifically designed for playback on a Pocket PC. The
movie in Figure 16-5 was created with the Video for Pocket PC (Full Screen
218 Kbps) setting. This setting allows you to store over 90 minutes of video
on a 256MB SD memory card.
Watching TV on your iPAQ
To watch TV shows on your iPAQ, you need a means of recording, compress-
ing, and transferring those shows to your iPAQ. The system that I’ve found
Figure 16-5:
You can use
Windows
Movie
Maker to
convert your

playback on

257
Chapter 16: More Multimedia

that best handles this whole process is SnapStream PVS (www.snapstream.
com). SnapStream PVS uses a TV tuner card installed in your desktop PC to
record TV shows from any available source so that you can watch the shows
when it’s convenient. This program also has a number of other really cool
features, such as the capability of supplying streaming video to any PC on
your network.
After you’ve recorded the show using SnapStream PVS, you can then com-
press that recording and transfer it to your iPAQ by using PocketPVS.
PocketPVS uses Windows Media Player on your iPAQ to display the video.
At the default settings, you need about 1MB of storage space for every minute
of video that you store on your iPAQ. This means that you can probably just 
fit a typical full-length movie onto a 128MB storage card. If you compare the
postage stamp size of a 128MB SD memory card with the size of a standard 
VHS video tape, this has to be one of the more amazing feats of miniaturization
around. No one could ever mistake TV viewing on the tiny iPAQ screen for a big
screen, high definition TV broadcast, but the quality is certainly good enough
to be enjoyable.
If you don’t have a TV tuner card in your desktop PC, SnapStream offers some
very good ones at quite reasonable prices on their Web site.
Displaying PowerPoint 
Slides on Your iPAQ
Okay, I admit that the screen on your iPAQ is too small to be very effective if
you want to give a PowerPoint presentation to a crowd. Even if everyone is
really friendly, that tiny screen just isn’t going to do the job. If you want to
make a good impression, your iPAQ is going to need a little help. Fortunately,
that help is finally here.
I’ve found a couple very handy adapter cards that enable your iPAQ to dis-
play an image by using a large screen monitor, a digital projector, or possibly
even a large TV set. With these cards, your iPAQ can show the world (or at
least a large group of people) your PowerPoint presentation or pretty much
anything else that appears on your iPAQ’s screen.
Your iPAQ’s screen has a resolution of 240 x 320 pixels — far lower than the
typical computer monitor or even a TV set. Fortunately, both of the video
adapter cards that I discuss have the ability to display a much higher resolu-
tion when connected to a large display. In fact, in some cases they’re able to
display up to 1024 x 768 pixels.
258
Part V: Multimedia Time 

The two iPAQ video display cards that I tested are:
 Margi Presenter-to-Go (www.margi.com)
 Colorgraphic Voyager VGA CF (www.colorgraphic.net)
As I write this, these cards are both available in the CompactFlash (CF) format.
In addition, Margi has a new SD card. If your iPAQ has both types of expansion
slots, I recommend the CF card — it’s both a bit tougher and more convenient
(because using a CF card leaves the SD slot open for a memory card).
Depending on the expansion slots that are available on your iPAQ, either of
the video adapter cards may work well for you, but the two units do have
some differences. Here’s a list of the most important differences that I found:
 The Margi Presenter-to-Go includes a remote control that works through
your iPAQ’s infrared port. This makes it possible to control a PowerPoint
presentation from some distance away.
 The Colorgraphic Voyager VGA CF has the ability to display your presen-
tation on a TV set that has a standard composite video input (an RCA
jack). This means that you can give a presentation even if a large screen
monitor or a digital projector isn’t available.
 The Margi Presenter-to-Go includes a basic application for displaying
PowerPoint slides. The Colorgraphic Voyager VGA CF includes a share-
ware version of Conduits Pocket Slides for this purpose. Because the
iPAQ has no native version of PowerPoint, you need special applications
like these in order to show PowerPoint slides with your iPAQ.
Regardless of the video adapter card that you choose, using your iPAQ for
presentations certainly makes it easier for you to bring your show along in
your pocket.
Reading eBooks
It’s pretty clear to anyone who uses an iPAQ that having a computer that fits
easily into your shirt pocket opens a whole new range of possibilities. The
eBook represents a great example of just how much these new ideas can
change the way we do ordinary things. In this case, that ordinary thing is
something you’re doing right now in the old traditional way — reading a
book. If this were an eBook, you wouldn’t be looking at ink printed on paper,
but rather words on your iPAQ screen.
259
Chapter 16: More Multimedia

What are eBooks?
People have been reading text on computer screens for as long as there have
been computer screens. It’s reasonable to ask, therefore, just how eBooks are
different from the plain old on-screen text that you’ve been seeing since you
started using computers. Actually, plain document text and eBooks have sev-
eral differences:
 Because your iPAQ is about the size of a paperback book, it’s easy to
hold your iPAQ in your hand while you read an eBook. This makes read-
ing eBooks far more like reading “real” books than like reading text on a
computer screen.
 The Microsoft Reader program that you use to read eBooks allows you
to search, bookmark, and annotate eBooks. You can even ask for the def-
inition of unfamiliar words as you’re reading.
 Many popular books — including current best-sellers — are available as
eBooks but not as plain text files because the eBook format allows pub-
lishers to control the distribution of titles. This way, both the authors
and publishers can earn the money that they deserve from their efforts.
 With your backlit iPAQ screen, you can read an eBook in the dark with-
out trying to find a flashlight with working batteries.
eBooks are stored in a highly compressed format that greatly reduces the
amount of storage space that’s needed. This format also allows publishers to
control who can read an eBook. Because of their special format, you need a
special program to read eBooks. On your iPAQ, that program is Microsoft
Reader.
Downloading eBooks
In order to read an eBook on your iPAQ, you’ve got to first get those eBooks
into your iPAQ. The process is similar to copying other files to your iPAQ, but
with a few differences.
Building your eBook library
The first thing that you need to do is find some eBooks that are worth read-
ing. For this, you may want to visit the Microsoft Reader Web site (www.
microsoft.com/reader/us/shop/default.asp) where you can find links
to several different eBook sellers. Some sites offer a selection of free eBooks
in addition to titles that you can purchase.
Unfortunately, many things fit loosely into the definition of eBooks. A lot of
what are called eBooks aren’t designed to be read on your iPAQ. When you 
260
Part V: Multimedia Time 

download eBooks, make certain that you’re downloading files that are speci-
fied as being Microsoft Reader–compatible files. Otherwise, you’re wasting
your time (and maybe money) by downloading files that you can’t use on
your iPAQ.
Understanding digital rights management
When you buy a printed book, the mere fact that it’s printed on paper and
bound together means that it’s really convenient for only one person to read
that copy at a time. If you think that the printed book is really good, you may
tell a friend about it so that she can buy her own copy. Or you may loan her
your copy when you’re finished reading the book. But it’s unlikely that you
can both share one copy at the same time — that would be pretty inconven-
ient, wouldn’t it?
In the past, the ease with which eBooks could be copied and shared has made
it difficult to find a lot of really good books in the eBook format. Unfortunately,
this ease of copying means that some people feel that it’s okay to give other
people free copies of any eBooks they may buy. Needless to say, authors and
publishers get discouraged when people give away hundreds of copies for
each copy that’s sold!
In an attempt at making publishing books in eBook format more popular,
Microsoft has made the Microsoft Reader Activation Pack available on your
iPAQ. This software adds something known as digital rights management
(DRM) to your iPAQ’s Microsoft Reader program. Why should you care about
this? It’s simple, really. After you run the Microsoft Reader Activation Pack,
your copy of the Microsoft Reader can then use eBooks that are copy pro-
tected. That is, you can buy premium quality books to read on your iPAQ
because those books cannot be copied and shared with other people. In
effect, this makes the premium eBooks that you buy act more like printed
books, and this gives publishers and authors an incentive to publish more
premium eBook titles, so everyone wins.
Managing your eBook library
Managing your eBook collection is easy. The main tasks are to control where
your eBooks reside on your iPAQ and to delete eBooks that you no longer
need, which frees up space for other uses. Here are some points to consider:
 Storing: A memory card is an excellent place to store your eBooks. You
don’t need any other accessories like modems to read eBooks, so you
could keep your entire eBook collection on a memory storage card that
you pop in whenever you want to view your library. Remember to place
the eBook files in the My Documents folder on the memory storage card.
 Encountering an error message: You may encounter a cryptic error
message if you try to delete an eBook by using tap-and-hold and select-
ing Delete from within Reader. If you do, this probably means that the
file is set to read-only mode and you can’t delete it from within Reader. If
this happens, you need to use the next method to delete the file.
261
Chapter 16: More Multimedia

 Managing files: You can use the File Explorer on your iPAQ to delete or
move files. Even so, you may find that it’s easier to click the Explore
button in ActiveSync on your desktop PC and then manage those files
from your desktop PC.
 Backing up: Backing up your eBooks on your desktop PC (see Chapter 5)
is an excellent idea — especially if you have purchased some premium
titles. That way, you’re protected in case anything happens to the file on
your iPAQ.
Reading an eBook
Some people build up big collections of fancy-looking books but never read a
single one of them. Your eBook collection is probably far more practical —
especially because eBooks just don’t have the same panache as a library full
of leather-bound law books.
To open an eBook, follow these steps:
1. Click the Start button and choose Programs➪Microsoft Reader to
open the library (see Figure 16-6).
2. Tap a book title to open that book.

Navigating an eBook
Reading an eBook is most definitely different from reading a bound paper
book or even from reading a text document on your desktop PC. For one
thing, how do you flip the pages?
The title page of each eBook contains several options that you can tap to nav-
igate your way through the book. To begin at the beginning, tap the Go To
button and then choose Begin Reading from the menu that pops up. The
Microsoft Reader program also keeps track of how far you’ve read and the
last page that you were viewing — so you don’t need to try to dog-ear any of
the pages!
When you begin reading, the Microsoft Reader program shows several things
on each page (see Figure 16-7), and you can use these to navigate your way
through the book:
 Down arrow: This arrow, located just to the right of the book title, pops
up a menu that you can use to return to the beginning, open your list of
annotations, view the guidebook, open the library, change the view set-
tings, or return to the last page that you were viewing.
 Left arrow: Located by the page number, this arrow returns you to the
next lower-numbered page. This may not necessarily be the last page
that you were reading if you jumped to a page from an annotation or
from the index.
Figure 16-7:
You can
navigate by
using the
arrows on
the page.
263
Chapter 16: More Multimedia

 Right arrow: Displays the next higher-numbered page. The current page
number appears between the two page navigation arrows.
 Riffle control: If you tap-and-hold the page number, you display the riffle
control along the bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 16-7. (The
riffle control shows the page number and the total number of pages.)
Drag the stylus along this control to quickly move through the manu-
script pages.
You can also use the Navigator button on the front of the iPAQ to move
through the book. Pressing the right side or the lower side of the button
moves you forward, and pressing the left side or the upper side of the button
moves you back.
One thing that’s very different about reading eBooks on your iPAQ compared
to reading a text document on your desktop PC is that eBooks always jump
an entire page at a time. You don’t see the line-by-line scrolling that’s
common when you’re viewing text documents.
Adding notes and such
Have you ever found yourself writing notes on one of those sticky notepads
and then placing the note into a book that you were reading? Eventually, it
becomes almost impossible to read the book without knocking the notes out of
place. And even if they stay where they belong, it can be really hard to remem-
ber where you made a note about this and where you made one about that.
When you’re reading an eBook, it’s really easy to add your own notes to the
text and to later go back and refer to those notes. To do so, tap the word or
phrase that you wish to annotate, and then choose Add Text Note from the
pop-up menu that appears, as shown in Figure 16-8.
Type in your note in the notepad that appears after you choose Add Text
Note, and then tap outside the notepad area to complete your note.
After you add notes to the text, you can review your notes with the annota-
tion index. When you open the index, tap the note that you’d like to see, and
the Reader opens the note as well as the page where you’ve added the note.
You also see a small note icon next to any line that contains a note.
Tap the keyboard icon to hide the on-screen keyboard when you’re viewing
existing notes. This enables you to view the eBook page in addition to simply
seeing the note itself. You can also tap the i in the upper part of the notepad
to see the note in context.
You can also add highlighting, a bookmark, or a drawing to the text by choos-
ing the proper option from the pop-up menu that appears when you select
text. If you want to quote the text exactly, you can copy the selected text.

Reading Laridian PocketBible
The Bible is probably the most popular book of all time for both scholarly
and religious reasons, so it’s only natural that it’s also a popular thing to read
on an iPAQ. Laridian (www.laridian.com) makes it easy for people to read
and study the Bible through their PocketBible for the iPAQ.
You may well wonder what advantages there might be to reading the Bible on
an iPAQ as opposed to simply picking up a printed version. Actually, several
come to mind:
 Reading translations: You can read and study from multiple translations
of the Bible on your iPAQ. This makes it easy to compare the different
versions so that you can more easily understand passages that may
seem a little confusing.
 Searching quickly: You can find what you want by using the find fea-
tures in PocketBible. This makes it much easier to find references to 
specific topics.
 Making notes: You can add your own notes, with hyperlinks to Bible
verses so that it’s easy to keep track of your references.
 Using other related sources: Additional reference books (such as dictio-
naries) are available from Laridian. This is especially useful if you want
to study the text or prepare talks on biblical topics.
Figure 16-8:

menu to add
bookmarks
and notes 
to your

265
Chapter 16: More Multimedia

Your iPAQ is also much smaller and easier to carry around than a printed
Bible — especially when you consider all the extra books (such as different
translations) that you can get from Laridian. Your iPAQ doesn’t get any heav-
ier when you add those extra books, either!

 Playing games on your iPAQ
 Finding some new games
I
f you are one of those people who feels guilty about taking a few minutes
now and then to enjoy yourself, you may want to just skip this chapter. But
it would probably be better if you didn’t because no matter how you look at it,
everyone needs the chance to relax and unwind a bit. In fact, I bet that you
could be even more productive if you let your hair down and have some fun.
The iPAQ is a surprisingly good video game machine. In fact, your iPAQ can
run literally hundreds of games in dozens of genres, so no matter what type
of game interests you, you’re bound to find at least one that fits your defini-
tion of fun. In the limited space that I have available, I show you a few games
that I like, but at least this should serve to whet your appetite. Go ahead,
have some fun!
I Wanna Play Right Now!
When you really need to play a game, you need it right now. After all, can you
predict just when you’ll need to spend a few minutes kicking back and taking
it easy? That’s why your iPAQ comes standard with a couple of games,
Jawbreaker and Solitaire, so that you can just get to it and have some fun.
To quickly find the games on your iPAQ, tap the Start button and then choose
Programs to open the Programs folder. Tap the Games folder that appears at
the top of the Programs folder.
Jawbreaker
Jawbreaker is one of those deceptively simple-looking games that quickly
becomes quite addictive. The whole point of the game is to remove the colored
balls (jawbreakers) from the screen by tapping groups of balls of one color.
Figure 17-1 shows the screen after the first couple of moves in a typical game.

The challenge in Jawbreaker is to get the highest possible score by putting
together the largest possible grouping of a single color before you tap the
group to remove it. Each extra ball that you add to a group multiplies the
score because you are awarded points based on this simple formula:
group points = number of balls x (number of balls – 1)
So, for example, a group of 2 balls is worth 2 points, a group of 3 balls is
worth 6 points, and a group of 4 balls is worth 12 points. In the figure, the
selected group has 9 balls, so the point value is 9 times 8 or 72.
The strategy for making larger groups of a single color is to remove small
groups lower down so that you drop the balls into a position where larger
groups of a single color are created. It sounds simple, but you quickly dis-
cover just how much of a challenge that can be.
Just to keep things interesting, Jawbreaker includes four different ways to play
the game. Choose Game➪Options to display the Options screen, and then
select one of the game play options from the Game Style drop-down list box.
If you let someone else play Jawbreaker on your iPAQ, select the Guest Mode
option on the Options screen to prevent their scores from being permanently
recorded — you wouldn’t want them posting the new high score, after all!

Tapping the Close button in Jawbreaker does not actually close the game. If
you want to really stop the game, tap the Start button and choose Settings to
display the Settings screen. Tap the System tab and then tap the Memory
icon to display the Memory screen. Tap the Running Programs tab and then
choose Jawbreaker from the list of running programs. Tap Stop to close
Jawbreaker and then tap OK to close the Memory screen. Tap OK to close the
Settings screen.
Playing Solitaire
Solitaire is probably the all-time favorite computer game. Sure, many fun
games have all sorts of fans, but Solitaire has probably burned up more com-
puter time than virtually any other computer game. One reason for this may
simply be that versions of Solitaire are available on almost any type of com-
puter. Solitaire is also installed on every iPAQ right out of the box, so you can
play if you want to do so.
Figure 17-2 shows the iPAQ version of Solitaire. To play Solitaire, click the
Start button and choose Programs to open the Programs folder. Tap the
Games folder to open it and click the Solitaire icon to start a new game.
To choose your game options, choose Tools➪Options to display the Options
screen.

Finding More Games to Challenge You
As you may have guessed, the fertile minds of game developers have created
more for the iPAQ than just the ones previously mentioned in this chapter. All
sorts of games have been developed for the iPAQ.
Downloading iPAQ games
Most iPAQ games are quite small, so downloading them from the Web is one
of the best ways to get them. Many iPAQ games are free, but you can also find
shareware games and commercial products at various sites. Shareware pro-
grams come in several varieties, but they all share one common thread: You
get the chance to give them a try before you buy them. If you like the game,
you send in a small amount of money to register your copy. Registration
allows the game to continue to be used after the expiration date (if one
exists). It may also add extra features or simply ease your conscience know-
ing that you aren’t stealing the fruits of someone else’s work.
Some Web sites offer several varieties of games in a single listing. If you see
notations like PPC and HPC (or something similar), the programs that you
want are those listed as PPC.
One of the first places to go for iPAQ games to download is the Pocket PC
Downloads Web site at www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/resources/
downloads/pocketpc/default.mspx. Here you find links to a number of
interesting programs.
For freeware and shareware iPAQ games that you can download, one of the best
places is the Tucows Web site at pda.tucows.com/top_section_142.html.
Looking at some other iPAQ games
The games that you can play on your iPAQ run the gamut from deceptively
simple to extremely complex. Some of the best of them are the ones that
seem very simple but end up requiring a lot of strategy to do well.
In this section, I look at some really great games that get you itching to play.
Monopoly
Monopoly is one of those classic board games that almost everyone has played
at some point when growing up. Who doesn’t remember the hours spent
wheeling, dealing, and trying to bankrupt your friends and family members as
you moved through familiar streets like St. Charles Place and Boardwalk?
270
Part V: Multimedia Time 

All the fun of Monopoly is now available for your iPAQ, as shown in Figure 17-3.
This version, from Handmark (www.handmark.com), allows up to four players
in any combination of real people and computer-generated opponents.
Handmark’s version of Monopoly plays very much like the original board
game but it removes the possibility for the banker to dip his or her fingers
into the till. Just watch out for property auctions — the computer seems to
win most auctions by conveniently ignoring competing bids. (However, you
can choose Game➪Rules and then select the Pass Instead of Auction check
box to eliminate the auction option if you prefer.)
Tap the tiny Menu tab in the upper-left corner of the board to display a menu
when you want to buy or sell houses and hotels, mortgage a property, or set
up a trade. Be sure to do this before you tap the dice — otherwise, you have
to wait for your next turn before you can act.
Scrabble
Scrabble is another classic board game that has arrived on the iPAQ. It’s one
of those enjoyably frustrating games — after you begin playing, you just
don’t want to quit.
Figure 17-4 shows a game of Scrabble in progress. (As Player 1, I’m winning
this time.) Just like with Monopoly, you can play against human or computer-
generated opponents. Scrabble is available from Handmark (www.handmark.
com).

Warfare Incorporated
If classic board games aren’t your style, you may want to check out Warfare
Incorporated, another of the Handmark games (www.handmark.com). In this
game, your objective is to build a mining colony and defend it against a
bunch of hostile opponents. You have to mine ore, build your forces, and try
to wipe out the enemy without running out of money or allowing your facili-
ties to be destroyed. It’s not as easy as it sounds!
Figure 17-5 shows an example screen from Warfare Incorporated.
Pocket Gambler
If you love to play casino games but you can’t always do so — either because
a casino isn’t next door or because it costs too much — check out Pocket
Gambler from ZIO (www.ziointeractive.com/games_ppc.html). Figure 17-6

Pocket Gambler package.

Finding iPAQ Applications
In This Chapter
 Finding out what can run on your iPAQ
 Locating iPAQ programs
 Installing iPAQ programs
 Making some room
Your iPAQ is pretty handy all by itself, but it can be even more useful 
with the addition of a few new programs. That’s where the versatility of
having a real computer that fits into your pocket really shines — your iPAQ
isn’t limited to performing just one or two dedicated functions. By adding
new programs, you can use your iPAQ for virtually unlimited purposes. In
fact, almost anything that can be done with a desktop PC can also be done
with an iPAQ.
In this chapter, I show you how to get what you want from your iPAQ by find-
ing and installing new applications that are compatible with your iPAQ.
Understanding What 
Can Run on the iPAQ
Your iPAQ uses an operating system called Windows Mobile 2003. From this
name, you may get the impression that any of your Windows programs from
your desktop PC can run on your iPAQ; this simply isn’t so. Windows Mobile
2003 may be related to the version of Windows that runs on your desktop 
PC, but the relationship isn’t quite close enough to allow you to share your
programs.
Here are some important things that you need to know about what can run
on your iPAQ:

 For the iPAQ: If a program is specified as being specifically for the iPAQ,
it can almost certainly run on your iPAQ — unless the specifications also
indicate that the program is for a specific iPAQ model. Most programs
designed for any iPAQ model can also run on other iPAQ models, but this
is not always the case. When in doubt, ask the software manufacturer
before you buy (or get a trial version if one is available).
 For the Pocket PC 2002: Most programs that were designed for the
Pocket PC 2002 devices also run on Windows Mobile 2003, but a few
exceptions do exist. Again, checking with the manufacturer or using a
trial version is your safest bet.
 For Windows CE 2.0: Many programs designed for Windows CE 2.0 also
run on the iPAQ, but it’s best to try before you buy. Windows CE 2.0 pro-
grams swap the positions of the iPAQ’s Start button and the program’s
menu or toolbar, but this change is temporary. After you exit the
Windows CE 2.0 program, your iPAQ returns to normal.
 For palm-sized PCs: Some programs are listed as being for palm-sized
PCs. This term could mean many things. For example, it may mean that
the program is really for the Palm PC operating system (OS) and is
totally incompatible with your iPAQ. Don’t buy one of these programs
unless you get some assurance that you can get your money back if it
doesn’t work on your iPAQ.
 For Windows CE HPC or HPC/Pro: If a program says that it’s for Windows
CE HPC or HPC/Pro devices, it probably doesn’t work on your iPAQ unless
it specifically says that it also runs on Pocket PC (PPC) devices. You may
even see other variations on this jargon jungle, so always watch for the
PPC or iPAQ designation.
One of the most important things to ask for when buying iPAQ software is
whether you can try the program to make sure that it works before you plunk
down your money. Many iPAQ programs have demo or trial versions that you
can check out before buying. If you can’t get a trial first, make certain that
you can get a refund if the program doesn’t work on your iPAQ.
Finding Software on the Web
Most iPAQ software is distributed by way of downloads from the Internet.
One of the big reasons for this is that iPAQ software tends to be very com-
pact compared to desktop PC software. An awful lot of functionality can be
packed into a very small package when that package is intended for the iPAQ.
The Web sites that distribute iPAQ software tend to fall into two major 
categories: Web sites that belong to software developers and Web sites that
offer software from many different manufacturers. Each has advantages and
disadvantages:
278
Part VI: Working with iPAQ Add-Ons 

 Disadvantage: A software developer’s Web site generally offers only
those products produced by that one company, which limits your
choices somewhat compared to the more general sites.
 Advantage: The software developer’s Web site may have the most recent
updates sooner than the general sites. You may also find beta versions
that enable you to test features that will appear in upcoming release ver-
sions. (Beta software is software that isn’t quite ready for prime time —
it’s a test version that may contain a number of bugs and other gremlins
to make life interesting for the testers.)
 Disadvantage: Sites offering software from a variety of manufacturers
can make it a little harder for you if you are looking for software from a
specific manufacturer because of the sheer variety of options they offer.
 Advantage: A Web site that offers software from a variety of manufactur-
ers gives you more choices and often uses a rating system to help you
decide which products best suit your needs.
Some great iPAQ software download sites include the following:
 www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/resources/downloads/
pocketpc/default.mspx
 www.developerone.com
 mobile.handango.com/home.jsp?siteId=1
 pda.tucows.com/pocketpc.html
 www.handmark.com/products/category.php?cat=20
 www.pocketgear.com/
Getting down to business
Chapter 17 introduces many different types of games for your iPAQ. Games
may be a lot of fun, but playing games doesn’t get your work done. If you
want to get down to business with your iPAQ, plenty of programs are avail-
able to help you do so.
Here’s a sample of the types of business-related programs that you can find
for the iPAQ:
 Database: Several developers have filled an important gap in the suite of
built-in iPAQ applications by creating database programs. These types 
of programs can be extremely useful for anyone who needs to keep track
of lots of information, such as an inventory listing or the status of rooms
in a large convention hotel.
279
Chapter 18: Finding iPAQ Applications

If you want to use a large database on your iPAQ, the built-in storage
memory likely needs to be expanded by using a memory card.
 Unit conversion: A number of developers have created iPAQ programs
that are loaded with different unit conversions, which can be quite
useful for anyone working on a large international project or for some-
one ordering supplies for a building project. They also take the place of
pocket reference guides because these programs not only show the con-
version factors but also do the math for you.
 Calculator: You can find applications that turn your iPAQ into a super-
sophisticated calculator. These programs come in handy for anyone
involved in science or in financial calculations.
 Fax: Some programs even enable you to send a fax from your iPAQ. Even
though e-mail capability is built into the iPAQ, some people don’t have
e-mail addresses, so sending them a fax may be the only way to quickly
get written information into their hands.
Chapter 21 shows some specific examples of some very useful business-
related iPAQ programs. Figure 18-1 shows one iPAQ program, eWallet from
Ilium Software (www.iliumsoft.com). One difference between programs for
your iPAQ and those for your desktop PC is that iPAQ programs tend to be far
less expensive, making it much easier to justify adding a handy program that
you could really use.

Part VI: Working with iPAQ Add-Ons 

Adding some utilities
Utility programs aren’t the most exciting of iPAQ applications. That’s to be
expected because most people don’t want to put much thought into the inner
workings of their iPAQ. Still, the utility programs do have a lot to offer:
 Taking screen captures: You may never need to take screen captures of
your iPAQ screens, but aren’t you glad that someone created that utility
so that I can show you the lovely pictures throughout this book?
 Switching between programs: Closing down programs on an iPAQ isn’t
always easy because your iPAQ is supposed to close unneeded programs
when something else needs the memory. Still, it’s really nice to have a
utility program that allows you to easily switch between open programs
and to decide for yourself which ones to shut down.
 Managing memory: Because memory space is so important on an iPAQ,
several utilities have been designed to help you manage memory. Some
seek out useless files that can be deleted, and others make it possible to
cram more into memory by compressing data into less space.
 Reading PDF documents: Because many important documents are only
available in Portable Document Format (PDF), you may want to be able
to read those types of documents on your iPAQ. Luckily, software has
been created for you to do so.
 Using a scripting utility: If you often use your iPAQ to perform compli-
cated tasks that require a whole series of precise steps, a scripting utility
could be quite useful. A scripting utility enables you to create a script (or
macro) that goes through the whole process for you so that you don’t
have to keep repeating it yourself.
These are just a few examples of the broad range of useful utility programs
that you can find for your iPAQ. Figure 18-2 shows one of these utilities,
Custom Convert from Surerange (www.surerange.com).
Many utility programs are useful only occasionally. Rather than using up
memory on your iPAQ by keeping them loaded all the time, you may want to
load them when you need them and then remove them when you’re done
using them. You can always use ActiveSync to reload these programs from
your desktop PC as necessary. Be sure to keep any activation codes handy,
though, because some programs require you to re-enter those codes if you
reinstall the program.
281
Chapter 18: Finding iPAQ Applications

Loading Programs You’ve Downloaded
When it comes to installing new programs on your iPAQ, your iPAQ and your
desktop PC really are companions — you generally need your desktop PC to
help install programs on your iPAQ. A few exceptions do exist, but most pro-
grams must first be loaded onto your desktop PC before they can be added to
your iPAQ.
It’s a good idea to set up a folder on your desktop PC specifically for any iPAQ
programs that you download. That way, you always know where to find them
when you want to install or reinstall them.
Here I step through a typical iPAQ program installation so that you know
what to expect when you want to add new programs to your iPAQ:
1. Make sure your iPAQ is connected to your desktop PC and ActiveSync
is running.
2. Open Windows Explorer on your desktop PC by clicking the Windows
Explorer icon and locate the installation program.

Part VI: Working with iPAQ Add-Ons 

Make note of the location where you save the program when you down-
load it. If you obtained the iPAQ program on CD-ROM or diskette, obvi-
ously you can find the installation program there.
3. Open the installation program by clicking or double-clicking it
depending on how your particular PC is set up to run programs.
This screen serves one very important purpose — it tells you which pro-
gram you’re trying to install.
4. Click Next to continue.
You now probably have several steps to follow that may include accept-
ing a license agreement, choosing where to store the files on your 
desktop PC, and choosing where you want the program to appear on
your desktop PC’s Start menu. Continue through these steps until you
see a message similar to the one shown in Figure 18-3.
5. In most cases, you want to click Yes to begin installing the program
onto your iPAQ.
The one exception is if you want to install the program onto a memory
storage card. If this is the case, click No and then choose the directory
in which you do want to install the program on your iPAQ.
6. When you see the message shown in Figure 18-4, you’re finished with
your desktop PC and need to look at your iPAQ’s screen to see if you
need to do anything there.
Typically, nothing is required on your iPAQ, but a few programs make
you disconnect your iPAQ and press the reset button.
7. Tap OK to finish.
Be sure to read the user’s manual, installation notes, or any other documen-
tation that comes with your iPAQ programs. These often contain some 
excellent tips that help you make the most of the program that you just
installed.

Chapter 18: Finding iPAQ Applications

Freeing Up Memory
An old saying claims that you can’t be too thin or too rich. When it comes to
iPAQs, you can say that you can’t have too much memory. Your iPAQ differs
in one very fundamental way from your desktop PC: Your iPAQ must store all
programs and data in memory at all times. Your desktop PC, on the other
hand, can put unused stuff out on a disk somewhere until it’s needed.
This difference between your iPAQ and your desktop PC is an important one.
It means that you can’t simply add new programs whenever you want with-
out making certain that you have enough room for them. On a desktop PC
with gigabytes of hard disk space, you’ll probably outgrow your desktop PC
long before you need to worry about space. On an iPAQ, available space can
be an issue almost as soon as you start adding new programs.
Unloading programs you don’t need
One of the great things about having your desktop PC and your iPAQ as part-
ners in installing iPAQ software is that you can typically remove programs
from your iPAQ and yet still have them available if you later decide to rein-
stall them. And because you may have to unload some programs when you
want to try out new iPAQ software, this can be a real lifesaver!
You can unload programs from your iPAQ in one of two primary ways: Remove
them by using just your iPAQ or by using ActiveSync on your desktop PC. Both
methods work, so it’s really up to you to decide which you prefer. I prefer to
use ActiveSync on my desktop PC because that way the desktop system and
my iPAQ always agree about which programs are installed.
Unloading programs by using ActiveSync
If you want to remove programs from your iPAQ by working through ActiveSync
on your desktop PC, here’s what you need to do:
Figure 18-4:
Be sure
to look at
your iPAQ’s
screen.
284
Part VI: Working with iPAQ Add-Ons 

1. Place your iPAQ in the synchronization cradle and open ActiveSync
on your desktop PC if it isn’t already open. (See Chapter 5 if you need
help with this.)
Of course, if you’re using a wireless network connection for your iPAQ,
you can skip the part about placing it in the synchronization cradle
because your network connection is likely much faster than the USB
connection — meaning that the wireless connection is a better option
for installing and removing most programs.
2. Choose Tools➪Add/Remove Programs.
ActiveSync examines your iPAQ to see which programs are currently
installed and then displays the Add/Remove Programs dialog box (see
Figure 18-5).
3. Remove the check mark from any programs that you want to uninstall
from your iPAQ.
You can also add a check mark to any of the listed programs that you
want to install.
Figure 18-5:
You can add
or remove
programs

285
Chapter 18: Finding iPAQ Applications

Don’t click the Remove button — doing so removes the program from
both your iPAQ and your desktop PC.
4. Click OK to make the changes.
Be sure to look at your iPAQ’s screen to see if you need to do anything
else, like reset your iPAQ.
Using ActiveSync on your desktop PC to remove programs from your iPAQ has
another advantage that you may not have considered: By using ActiveSync,
you can be sure that you still have the ability to reinstall the program if neces-
sary. If you uninstall a program directly on your iPAQ as shown in the next sec-
tion, it’s possible to remove programs and not be able to reinstall them without
first downloading the installation program from the Web.
Unloading programs directly on your iPAQ 
If you’d rather work directly on your iPAQ, you can uninstall programs with-
out using your desktop PC — this may be your only choice if you’re away
from your desk but need to download a large file directly into your iPAQ by
using your Internet connection.
Here’s how to unload programs directly from your iPAQ:
1. Tap the Start button on your iPAQ and choose Settings to open the
Settings screen.
2. Click the System tab and then tap the Remove Programs icon to dis-
play the list of programs that are currently installed in your iPAQ’s
storage memory (see Figure 18-6).
3. Select any of the programs that you want to uninstall and then click
the Remove button.
4. Tap OK when you have removed everything that you don’t want and
you’re finished.
You’ve probably noticed that neither using ActiveSync on your desktop PC
nor using Remove Programs directly on your iPAQ offers you the option of
removing all the programs on your iPAQ. That’s because the basic applica-
tions on your iPAQ — things like Pocket Word and Pocket Excel — are loaded
permanently into your iPAQ’s ROM (read-only memory). Even though these
items are loaded into permanent memory, it’s possible to update them with
special software that can modify Flash ROM — a special type of ROM
included in all iPAQ systems specifically so that updates can be made if nec-
essary. See the support pages for your particular iPAQ model at www.hp.com
for information on possible updates.
286
Part VI: Working with iPAQ Add-Ons 

Deleting unneeded files
Of course, programs aren’t the only files that can eat up memory space on
your iPAQ. It’s a sure bet that other unneeded files are wasting space.
You have several ways to remove unneeded files from your iPAQ. For example,
if you’ve loaded a bunch of eBooks into the Microsoft Reader library, you can
delete those books when you’re done with them by using the tap-and-hold
method. You then choose Delete from the pop-up menu, and they’re sent off
into digital nothingness.
You may think that the Find link on the Memory settings screen offers a good
way to find and delete unneeded files. If so, you’d be half right. Sure, you can
use the find tool to locate files, but you can’t delete them when you find them.
A better way to find and delete files is to use the File Explorer, shown in
Figure 18-7. Here you can not only locate but also delete files.
To open File Explorer on your iPAQ, click the Start button and choose
Programs to open the Programs folder. Then, tap the File Explorer icon.
To view your files sorted by size (or some other sort order), tap the sort list
just below the time display and choose the sort order that you prefer. In
Figure 18-7 the list is sorted by name.

Chapter 18: Finding iPAQ Applications

Using HandyZIP
Almost anyone who uses a PC has encountered zipped (compressed) files at
some point. By using one of the popular Zip utilities such as WinZip (www.
winzip.com) you can compress files so that they take less room and so that
they’re faster to send via e-mail. Because of the far more limited storage
space on an iPAQ, being able to compress your files is even more important
than it is on your desktop system.
Unfortunately, the Zip utility that you use on your desktop PC doesn’t work
on your iPAQ. To work with Zip files on your iPAQ, you need a Zip utility, such
as HandyZIP (www.cnetx.com), designed specifically for use on your iPAQ.
Outlook has built-in security features that block certain types of file attach-
ments. If you send an e-mail message containing an attachment that Outlook
considers to be potentially dangerous, the recipient can’t open or save the
attachment — even if the attachment really is safe. One of the best ways to
avoid this type of problem is to place the attachment into a Zip file and then
send the Zip file as the message attachment. Outlook doesn’t block Zip file
attachments, so the recipient can open and save your attachment.

I
f you have ever taken a laptop PC along on a trip, you’re really going to love
traveling with your iPAQ. The much smaller size of the iPAQ means that 
it’s convenient even in situations where lugging along your laptop sounds like
medieval torture. By comparison, your iPAQ weighs just a few ounces and can
fit into a space smaller than most paperback novels. In this chapter, I show you
some of the many ways that your iPAQ can be the perfect traveling companion.
Your iPAQ as a Traveling Companion
Traveling can be lots of fun. Traveling can also be stressful — especially if
you don’t know where you’re going or you can’t speak the local language.
Your iPAQ is a really great tool for helping you cope with the problems that
can make travel less enjoyable than it should be. The past several years have
seen some pretty significant advances in the capabilities of the iPAQ and its
add-ons to make traveling far more enjoyable.
Using your iPAQ while traveling
Normal life doesn’t stop simply because you’ve hopped onto a plane for some
far-off vacation spot. Your iPAQ can help you keep things under control even
when you’re off on a trip. Here are some things that your iPAQ can do for you
while you’re traveling:

 Managing e-mail: Your iPAQ can help manage your e-mail by letting you
send and receive e-mail on the go. You can quickly handle the really
important messages that demand attention, and the rest can simply wait
until you get home.
 Planning ahead: You can use your iPAQ to check local weather forecasts
so that you know what to plan. After all, there’s no sense trying to plan a
day at the beach if a sudden storm is coming in tomorrow. Maybe that
art museum won’t be quite as stodgy as you feared.
 Dining out: If you suddenly get the urge for a great meal, you can use
your iPAQ to find restaurant ratings for the area in which you’re travel-
ing. Not all of your vacation meals have to come out of a fast food bag,
do they?
 Finding fun places: If the place that you’re visiting turns out to be really
boring, you can log on to your favorite travel Web site and find out what
other destinations are available at bargain prices at the last minute.
 Curing boredom: If you get really bored, you can whip out your iPAQ
and play a couple rounds of Jawbreaker. Playing Jawbreaker is probably
more interesting than listening to that salesman tell you everything that
you didn’t want to know about buying wool socks.
iPAQ travel considerations
Traveling with your iPAQ should be as simple and carefree as possible. If your
iPAQ is going to make travel easier and more fun, dealing with problems along
the way is about the last thing you want to do. Here are some things to
remember to make your iPAQ a better traveling companion:
 Consider your power source: iPAQs can run only as long as they have
power. Because all iPAQs use special built-in batteries, you can’t just pop
into the local drugstore and get new batteries for your iPAQ. Make cer-
tain that you bring your power adapter along so that you can recharge
your iPAQ’s batteries when necessary.
 Have a foreign outlet adapter: If you’re going to be traveling in a foreign
country, you probably need an adapter to plug the iPAQ’s AC adapter
into a power outlet. These adapters for foreign outlets can be hard to
find on the road, so I suggest that you buy the right adapters before you
leave.
 Think of alternative power options: You may want to consider one of
the solar panel or spare battery options that I mention in Chapter 20.
That way, you can avoid the whole funny electrical outlet mess while
you show everyone just how cool you really are.
 Get local Internet access numbers: Connecting to the Internet while
you’re on a trip can be a real experience. Research the local access num-
bers before you go so that you know how to access your ISP. You also
290
Part VI: Working with iPAQ Add-Ons 

need to know what toll-free numbers are available because local access
numbers have a tendency to change frequently.
 Check Internet access rates: If you’re going to be traveling in a foreign
country, check out your Internet access options before you go. Even if
you’re able to connect easily, make certain that you aren’t paying expen-
sive international long distance rates to access the Internet.
 Try not to look suspicious: It’s even possible that some authorities may
consider your iPAQ or some of its accessories — especially things like
GPS receivers — to be spying equipment. You can lose your iPAQ or
even be thrown in jail if the authorities are feeling especially hostile. If
you’re in doubt, check with your travel professional before bringing
along your iPAQ. Whatever you do, be prepared to demonstrate that
your iPAQ really does work and that it isn’t a bomb in disguise.
 Protect your iPAQ from theft: An iPAQ can look pretty attractive to a
thief. Be sure to set a system password before you go (see Chapter 3),
and don’t put your iPAQ down anywhere that it becomes an easy target.
Finding Your Way — Without 
Asking for Directions
No one really likes to stop and ask for directions. Sure, some people (men and
women) make a joke about how members of the opposite sex (again, men and
women) drive on into oblivion because they refuse to ask for directions, but
the ones making that joke probably couldn’t tell if a map was upside down or
backwards, anyway.
One of the problems with asking for directions is simple — the directions that
most people give are usually so poor that no one could follow them even if
they wanted to. When people give directions, they tend to forget to include 
a lot of important details. I don’t want to know that I’m supposed to turn by
Mrs. Jones’ apple tree; I want to know that I need to follow Highway 101 for 
2.3 miles and then turn right onto Crosspointe Boulevard. Your iPAQ can help
eliminate these directional woes.
Reading maps on your iPAQ
Roadmaps are the standard tool for finding your way around unfamiliar terri-
tory. Of course, finding the right maps and keeping track of them while you’re
traveling just adds additional complication to what should be an enjoyable
trip. To cut down the clutter and make things easier, you can download maps
onto your iPAQ.
291
Chapter 19: Traveling with Your iPAQ

As handy as having roadmaps available on your iPAQ may be, I think that pair-
ing your iPAQ with a GPS receiver (as I discuss in the following section) is a far
better way to navigate with your iPAQ. Each of the GPS receivers that I discuss
comes with its own set of maps, so you don’t have to figure out where to get
the ones you need.
Connecting a GPS to your iPAQ
If you’ve ever been lost while traveling, you’re going to love adding a Global
Positioning Satellite (GPS) receiver to your iPAQ. This innovation has made it
possible to always have an accurate fix on your position to within a few feet
of your exact location. If you have a GPS and still get lost, you’ve got to be
really trying to get lost!
GPS receivers work by comparing radio signals from a series of satellites that
are circling the earth. In order to actually receive these very weak signals,
your GPS receiver must be in a position where it can actually “see” the sky
directly overhead, which means that a GPS receiver generally doesn’t work
inside your house, while you’re driving through a tunnel, or even in a forest if
the canopy of trees overhead is too dense. It also means that when you first
try out your GPS unit, you’re likely to find the whole experience a little frus-
trating if you’re attempting to get familiar with it in the comfort of your office.
Go outside, and your GPS receiver begins to work as soon as it can see the
satellites. You can try placing the GPS receiver in a window, too; but don’t
you need to get some fresh air anyway?
Getting the right GPS receiver
When the first iPAQs became available, owners had few choices in GPS
receivers. Recently, though, the number of different options that you can
choose from has exploded. This is great because it means that each manufac-
turer is producing far better hardware and software packages than those that
were available even a couple years ago.
Several different GPS receiver manufacturers exist, so you have a number of
choices in buying a GPS receiver to team up with your iPAQ. First, you need
to decide which type of hardware you want. GPS receivers designed for use
with the iPAQ come in three general flavors:
 Some GPS receivers connect to your iPAQ by using the sync connector
at the bottom of your iPAQ. That means that the connection is made
through the same connector you use to connect your iPAQ to your 
desktop PC. These type of GPS receivers require a special cable that is
designed for the iPAQ. These GPS receivers also typically include an
adapter that plugs into the 12-volt power outlet on your car’s dash to
power both the GPS receiver and your iPAQ.
292
Part VI: Working with iPAQ Add-Ons 

 A number of CF-slot GPS receivers are also available. These GPS
receivers plug into the CompactFlash (CF) expansion slot on the top of
your iPAQ so that you can use your iPAQ and the GPS receiver as a
single, compact unit. These units are especially handy for use when
you’re hiking because they don’t depend on being powered by your car.
Remember, though, that this type of GPS receiver doesn’t fit any of the
iPAQ models that have a single Secure Digital (SD) expansion slot.
 The newest types of GPS receivers are the Bluetooth models. These con-
nect wirelessly to your iPAQ via Bluetooth and leave your expansion slot
open so that you can add memory to hold your maps. Typically, these
Bluetooth receivers include (or offer as an option) a rechargeable bat-
tery so that they can operate for up to six hours between charges. (Isn’t
that built-in Bluetooth a great capability?)
Each model of GPS receiver seems to offer a different mix of connection and
power options. In most cases, you want the ability to power both your iPAQ
and the GPS receiver from your car’s cigarette lighter, so choose the proper
cables (even if they are optional) to allow this. Be sure to see Chapter 20 for
additional ways to power your iPAQ on the go.
Although the GPS manufacturers don’t really want you to know this, I’ve
found that you can use any of the navigation software with any of the iPAQ-
compatible GPS receivers. This doesn’t mean, however, that all of the GPS
receivers are identical. It simply means that they all adhere to the NEMA
standard — the means by which GPS receivers transmit data to computers.
The h1930/1935 iPAQ is incompatible with GPS receivers that connect via the
sync cable connector. Because this model lacks both a CF slot and built-in
Bluetooth capabilities, the only way for it to use a GPS receiver currently is to
add an SDIO Bluetooth card such as the one that’s available from Socket
(www.socketcom.com), and then use a Bluetooth GPS receiver. Unfortunately,
this solution does have one drawback: You can only store as many map files
as can fit into the internal memory because no expansion slots can be avail-
able when the SDIO Bluetooth card is in use.
I take a quick look at several GPS receiver and software packages that you
may want to consider. Because I can only show you a very little about each of
them in the available space, I strongly urge you to visit the Web sites that I
mention to find out more about each of them and see which one best suits
your needs.
CoPilot Live Pocket PC 4
ALK Technology’s CoPilot Live Pocket PC 4 is an excellent example of the new
type of thinking that makes the current generation of GPS packages far more
useful along with your iPAQ than were the earlier efforts. As Figure 19-1
shows, the ALK CoPilot GPS receiver is a small Bluetooth-equipped unit that
you can place up to 30 feet from your iPAQ (making this just the ticket for
back seat drivers, I guess).
293
Chapter 19: Traveling with Your iPAQ

Just what do I mean by a new type of thinking? Well, if you’ve ever used a GPS
receiver along with your laptop PC, you know that the trip directions can be
difficult and dangerous to read while you’re driving. Sure, most GPS navigation
software has voice prompts, but hearing and understanding those prompts can
be really hard — especially if you like to listen to the radio while you’re driving.
CoPilot Live Pocket PC 4 addresses these problems with a product designed
especially for the small screen on your iPAQ. Rather than showing you a lot 
of minute road details, CoPilot Live Pocket PC 4 concentrates on making your
very next move easily understandable. Figure 19-2 shows how the screen typi-
cally appears when you’re navigating with CoPilot Live Pocket PC 4.
CoPilot Live Pocket PC 4 also incorporates a live vehicle tracking feature that
enables you to remotely track the location of a vehicle if it has a wireless
Internet connection. You can find out more about this product at www.alk.com.
Earthmate GPS
You’ve probably noticed that different people often approach the same task
from a different perspective. The DeLorme Earthmate GPS and Street Atlas
USA 2004 Handheld bundle certainly takes quite a different approach to navi-
gating with your iPAQ than some of the other packages that I tested.
Figure 19-1:
The CoPilot
GPS
receiver is a

unit that

294
Part VI: Working with iPAQ Add-Ons 

The first difference with the Earthmate GPS unit (see Figure 19-3) is how many
different options it provides. This GPS receiver has the ability to connect to
your iPAQ or your laptop PC via Bluetooth, USB, or a serial connection —
depending on the optional cables that you buy. It also offers several power
options including AAA batteries, a rechargeable battery pack, an adapter for
your cigarette lighter, and an AC adapter.
The DeLorme Street Atlas USA 2004 Handheld software also differs consider-
ably from most other mapping software for your iPAQ. DeLorme is certainly
one of the leaders in mapping and GPS software for desktop and laptop PCs,
and this handheld version reflects that heritage. For example, although Street
Atlas USA 2004 Handheld allows you to set up routes directly on your iPAQ,
you can also use Street Atlas USA 2004 to set up your route on your desktop
system, and then easily export the route and the maps to your iPAQ. You may
find that this approach suits your needs quite well because it is generally far
easier to set an exact route on your desktop system than on your iPAQ.
Figure 19-4 shows an example of starting to navigate with Street Atlas USA
2004 Handheld.

PocketMap Navigator GPS
PocketMap Navigator GPS from Space Machine (www.spacemachine.net)
offers another excellent choice for GPS navigation with your iPAQ. Space
Machine offers GPS receivers in Bluetooth, CF, and the mouse type of unit
that connects directly to the sync port on the bottom of your iPAQ (see
Figure 19-5). The mouse type of receiver that I tested is particularly handy for
use in your car because a single cable plugs into your cigarette lighter and
powers both the GPS receiver and your iPAQ.
The PocketMap Navigator mouse-type GPS receiver doesn’t work with the
h1930/1935 iPAQ due to an incompatible sync port on that model of iPAQ.
The PocketMap Navigator software offers some of the best voice prompts of
any of the navigation software that I tested. (It sounds like Professor Stephen
Hawking.) This can be an important factor in helping you safely navigate —
especially if you’re driving alone. Figure 19-6 shows an example of navigating
with the PocketMap Navigator software.

TeleType WorldNavigator
The TeleType WorldNavigator (see Figure 19-7) is the only CF-type GPS receiver
that I tested for this book. For those iPAQ models with a CF expansion slot, this
type of GPS receiver is certainly the most convenient for navigation on foot.
With a CF-type GPS receiver, your iPAQ provides the power to the GPS receiver
and you have one neat little package.
The TeleType GPS software (shown in Figure 19-8) offers a number of unique
features including voice recognition. As the figure shows, this software also
provides navigation prompts that are quite easy to see. The maps that are
included tend to concentrate on major roads, however, so you may have a
little bit of difficulty navigating to smaller roads in some rural areas. You can
find out more about the TeleType GPS products at the TeleType Web site
(www.teletype.com).

Pharos iGPS
Pharos was one of the earliest providers of GPS receivers and navigation soft-
ware for the Pocket PC market, and their newest Bluetooth iGPS receiver 
certainly reflects the progress that they have made. This receiver (shown in
Figure 19-9) is by far the coolest-looking Bluetooth GPS receiver anywhere
with its clear plastic case and blue light-emitting diode (LED). The Pharos
unit is also the only one that comes in a travel case so that you have an
easier time keeping everything together.
The Pharos Ostia software (see Figure 19-10) offers fairly simple voice prompts
(such as “left turn ahead”), easy to read navigation notes, and good road detail.
You can find out more about the Pharos products at their Web site (www.
pharosgps.com).
Socket GPS Nav Kit
It simply wasn’t possible to test every GPS receiver and navigation software
combination that’s available for your iPAQ, so some units like the Socket GPS
Nav Kit had to be left out. Still, you may want to add this unit to those you
want to consider. If so, visit the Socket Web site (www.socketcom.com) for
the latest details.

Storing your GPS maps
One of the biggest problems with using a GPS receiver with any type of hand-
held device is that detailed maps can take a lot of space. And because you
probably want the best, most detailed map possible when you’re traveling,
storage space on your iPAQ is suddenly a big issue. Here are some possible
solutions:
 Try downloading a map that covers a smaller area or one that has less
detail.
 You can uninstall pretty much everything else from your iPAQ’s built-in
storage memory. Of course, this greatly reduces the value of your iPAQ
as a traveling companion, and it still may not even give you enough
room for some maps.
 You can add a memory storage card to your iPAQ and store your maps
there. This is by far the best solution, and the only one that I recom-
mend (unless, of course, your GPS receiver is already using the expan-
sion slot). This is an especially good solution with those iPAQ 2002
systems that have two independent expansion slots.
The software user’s manual for your GPS receiver has information on the spe-
cific procedures necessary to download maps from your desktop PC to your

Chapter 19: Traveling with Your iPAQ

Using your GPS receiver
You have two ways to use a GPS receiver along with your iPAQ: navigating by
latitude and longitude and navigating with maps. If you need to navigate to a
specific location by using latitude and longitude, the GPS receiver can show
you this in very fine detail.
Use the GPS Info display (see the help files for your brand of mapping software
if you need help finding this) to identify a precise location even when a map is
unavailable for an area. For example, you can use this display to return to the
exact spot on a large lake where you caught all those fish on your last fishing
trip, and you don’t have to worry about leaving any markers that may tip off
other anglers to your favorite hot spot.
One important point to remember (no matter which GPS receiver and naviga-
tion software you use) is that manufacturers often release free updates and
patches on their Web sites. You should check for these fixes often — especially
if you’re having any problems making it all work.
Trying to navigate with your iPAQ and a GPS receiver while you’re driving can
be very dangerous. If possible, have someone else watch the display or make
certain that you have a good idea of your route before you begin driving. If
your navigation software offers voice prompts, this can also increase the
safety factor considerably.
Using your iPAQ as a pilot’s companion
If you happen to be a pilot, you certainly can appreciate the compact size and
convenience of an iPAQ. Nothing else is quite as cramped as the cockpit of a
typical private aircraft. So when it comes to choosing tools to help you plan a
trip and find your way, you want something that does a lot for you and doesn’t
take up too much room — if this doesn’t describe an iPAQ, I don’t know what
does! iPAQs are very popular with private pilots for exactly this reason.
I’ve discovered a very useful program aimed at iPAQ owners who also happen
to be pilots. Although I don’t have a lot of room to devote to this, I would like
to mention it and then suggest that you visit the manufacturer’s Web site for
more information. Hahns’s Flight Planner (www.hahnsllc.com) offers com-
plete flight-planning functions and even assists you in filing a flight plan.
Figure 19-11 shows an example of using the program to obtain a weather
briefing.

Speaking the Language
One of the most difficult things about visiting foreign countries is being
unable to speak the common language. 
Aside from learning the languages that are spoken in the areas where you
want to travel, getting a language translator that runs on your iPAQ may be
one of the best ways to deal with understanding what’s going on when you’re
traveling. Getting a quick translation may also be the key to keeping yourself
from going hungry, as Figure 19-12 illustrates.
One product that I’ve found for translating between languages on the iPAQ is
the ECTACO Partner Voice Translator (shown in Figure 19-12). This software
is available in versions for many different languages (www.ectaco.com).
Although you can use the ECTACO Partner Voice Translator to translate your
spoken phrases into another language, I’ve found that the results can some-
times be more amusing than accurate. It’s generally safer to tap the View
button and then choose the phrase you want from the list that appears.

Entertainment Guides
When you’re traveling, it’s really nice to have a local expert to give you advice
about where to find a good meal or other attractions. Unfortunately, it can be
pretty hard to find those experts when you need them, and the result could be
yet another lousy hotel restaurant meal. With a bit of help, though, your iPAQ
can be that expert and you can be spared the rubber chicken. All you need is
one of the applications that I mention next.
Vindigo
Vindigo is a service that helps you find all those handy details that make a
trip more enjoyable. Want some great German food or the location of the best
local art museum? Or maybe you don’t want to spend the evening in your
hotel room watching TV and would like to find the closest wine bar? Well,
Vindigo can help.

Vindigo is a subscription-based service. After you set up your favorite 
cities, Vindigo automatically downloads new information from their Web 
site (www.vindigo.com). You can sign up for a free 30-day trial to see if
Vindigo is for you.
ZAGAT TO GO
ZAGAT TO GO is another option that functions similarly to Vindigo. When you
install the ZAGAT TO GO service on your iPAQ, you then have the option to
download some of the best-known restaurant guides in the world. Figure 19-14
shows how ZAGAT TO GO displays a listing so that you can find a good meal.
You can find out more about subscribing to ZAGAT TO GO at their Web site

n case you haven’t noticed this already, you can buy a lot of add-ons for
your iPAQ. Some of these accessories are really useful, some are a lot of
fun, and some defy easy description. One of the benefits of writing a book like
this is that I get to try out a lot of these gadgets, and in this chapter I show
you some of the best of them.
What Works with Your iPAQ
Before you go out and spend your money on accessories, you need to know
which devices actually work with your iPAQ. Nothing is worse than getting
excited about some great gadget, buying it, and then finding out that it doesn’t
work. Here are some guidelines to help you avoid this disappointment:
 Know your expansion slot: Make certain that you know the type and
size of your iPAQ’s expansion slot. The most common one is the Secure
Digital (SD) slot, but CompactFlash (CF) expansion slots and PC Card
expansion slots are also available with some iPAQ models.
 Have the proper connection cables: iPAQs generally have a serial con-
nection, but you may need to buy a special cable from your iPAQ’s manu-
facturer to connect to standard serial devices (like external modems).

 Check the required driver software: Even if you have the correct cable,
some serial devices don’t work with an iPAQ. Anything that needs special
driver software works only if it includes a driver specifically designed
for the iPAQ. Drivers intended for the version of Windows on your desk-
top PC don’t work on your iPAQ.
 Check the required iPAQ model: Some devices are designed to work
with specific iPAQs. If the package lists specific models but not the par-
ticular iPAQ that you own, ask before you buy (and get an assurance that
you can return the item if it doesn’t work for you). This especially applies
to the h1900 series because they seem to have the most compatibility
problems.
Adding Storage
Without any question, my favorite iPAQ accessory is additional storage.
Because iPAQs store everything in memory, it’s easy to use up the available
memory when you get carried away with adding new programs, eBooks,
music, or whatever to your iPAQ. In fact, that’s one of the main hazards of
being as versatile as the iPAQ is — users tend to dream up all sorts of great
things to do with them.
When you want to add more memory to your iPAQ, you need to get the cor-
rect type to fit your particular model. Figure 20-1 shows why this is so. In this
case, I placed three different types of memory next to each other so that you
can see how they differ in size. The large unit on the left is a PC Card hard
drive, the one in the middle is a CF memory card, and the one on the right is
an SD memory card. All current iPAQ models have an SD memory slot and a
few have a CF slot, but no iPAQ has a PC card slot built-in.
Although all current iPAQ models have at least one built-in expansion slot,
many older iPAQ models require an expansion sleeve like the MemPlug from
Portable Innovation Technology (www.pitech.com) shown in Figure 20-2.
Some expansion sleeves even include PC Card slots.
Two excellent sources of memory cards for your iPAQ are SanDisk (www.
sandisk.com) and SimpleTech (www.simpletech.com).
Any expansion card that’s inserted into your iPAQ draws a small amount of
power, so you may want to remove any cards (when they aren’t needed) to
maximize battery life. The drain caused by memory cards is extremely low,
though, so it might not be worth the risk of losing the card by removing it.

Chapter 20: Ten Great iPAQ Accessories

Communications Accessories
After you add some memory to your iPAQ, you probably want to add some
accessories that help your iPAQ communicate with the outside world. These
accessories cover a broad range of abilities, so in the following sections I
break them down into some general categories.
Wi-Fi adapters
Wi-Fi is probably the best thing that has ever happened to iPAQs. Wi-Fi gives
your iPAQ freedom from all those cables, allows you to find a comfortable
spot as you sit back and surf wirelessly, and opens up the whole world of
public hotspots for you. These are just some of the reasons why I feel that 
a Wi-Fi adapter is a must-have accessory for any iPAQ owner whose iPAQ
doesn’t have built-in Wi-Fi capabilities.
Wi-Fi adapters come in two iPAQ-compatible formats. The most common are
the ones that fit a CF slot, but SDIO Wi-Fi adapters also exist. Both types
worked well in my testing, but I found the CF Wi-Fi adapters to be a little
easier to configure, and they also seemed to offer a bit more range than the
SDIO models.
Here are the Wi-Fi adapters that I tested. I can recommend any of them for
use with your iPAQ:
 D-Link DCF-660W Wi-Fi adapter (www.dlink.com)
 SanDisk SDIO Wi-Fi adapter (www.sandisk.com)
 SMC SMC2642W Wi-Fi adapter (www.smc.com)
 Socket SDIO Wi-Fi adapter (www.socketcom.com)
The SDIO port on the h1900 series iPAQs has proven to be somewhat prob-
lematic. In fact, Hewlett-Packard (HP) has released a patch for the h1900 in an
attempt to correct the problem. You can find out more about this patch and
how to apply it at www.socketcom.com/faq/faq.asp?ID=172.
Adding a modem
Modems connect your iPAQ to the Internet so that you can use e-mail and
browse your favorite Web sites. Unfortunately, modems do have several dis-
advantages. Not only are they slow, but you need to find a compatible phone
jack and then string a phone cord between your iPAQ and the outlet. In addi-
tion, modems do not currently come in SD format, so you can use a modem
only if your iPAQ has a CF slot.
312
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Still, at times a modem is your only choice. Socket’s 56K CF Modem (www.
socketcom.com) is the unit that I have tested and found to work acceptably.
If you have a serial cable for your iPAQ, you can use almost any external
modem — you don’t need a special iPAQ-compatible external modem. Socket
also sells serial adapters for the iPAQ.
Adding a digital phone card
If you already have a digital cell phone, you probably have most of what you
need to connect your iPAQ to the Internet wirelessly. Using your cell phone
as your iPAQ’s wireless Internet connection is an option if a Wi-Fi connection
isn’t available. You can use the unused airtime from your cell phone for your
connection and you probably don’t have to pay extra to access the Internet.
Once again, Socket is the best source for digital phone cards, but a recent visit
to their Web site seems to indicate that digital phone cards may be on the way
out. Several models were listed as discontinued, so if you are interested in this
option, it’s probably a good idea to act quickly.
Connecting to your network
Your iPAQ normally connects to your desktop PC by using a USB connection,
or in some cases by using a Wi-Fi connection. You may find that these types
of connections simply aren’t convenient in your case because your desktop
PC’s USB ports are hard to reach or you don’t have a wireless network. If so,
you can also connect with an Ethernet adapter in your iPAQ to make a network
connection. Socket makes a couple different CF Ethernet adapters if you want
to try this type of connection.
A network connection is probably faster than either a USB or standard serial
connection when you’re transferring files. But unless you’ve added a very
large capacity memory card to your iPAQ and you’re moving a huge amount
of data, this doesn’t make much difference.
Adding a Keyboard
Any time you use a PC, you interact with it by inputting information. It doesn’t
really matter if you’re using an iPAQ or a desktop PC — you still need a way
to let the computer know what you want it to do.
313
Chapter 20: Ten Great iPAQ Accessories

The iPAQ presents both unique challenges and unique opportunities with
regards to input. As a result, some very interesting input accessories have
appeared.
Your iPAQ offers two primary means of inputting information. You can tap out
words by using the on-screen keyboard or you can write on the screen. Both
methods work, of course, but when you need to enter a lot of information, you
soon look for another option. That option can be a real keyboard like the one
on your desktop PC.
Figure 20-3 shows the Belkin folding wireless keyboard that I prefer to use
with the iPAQ. This keyboard uses infrared signals to communicate with your
iPAQ, and it folds into a neat little package that’s just about the same size as
an iPAQ.
Even though the h4350 iPAQ has a built-in keyboard below its screen, you prob-
ably find that an external keyboard like the Belkin unit shown in the figure is
far easier to use — especially if you’re going to be entering lots of text.
Figure 20-3:

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Digital Cameras
Digital photography has really made a huge impact on the world. Film compa-
nies sell far less film than they once did, and the most popular cell phones
today are those with built-in digital cameras. It seems only natural, then, to
add a digital camera accessory to your iPAQ.
It’s time to be honest about this — a digital camera accessory that you add to
your iPAQ is really more of a novelty than a replacement for a good quality,
standalone digital camera. Sure, the iPAQ add-on is much smaller than any
ordinary digital camera, and the ability to snap quick photos with your iPAQ
is kind of cool, but just don’t expect award winning photos from this type of
setup. If you think of the digital camera accessory as being a replacement for
one of those disposable snapshot cameras that you buy at the drugstore,
you’re going to be a whole lot happier.
In writing this book, I tested two digital camera add-ons. I take a quick look at
each of them.
FlyCAM-CF
Figure 20-4 shows the LifeView FlyCAM-CF. This unit has a flash, can take still
images up to 1280 x 1024 pixels, and can record Audio Video Interleave (AVI)
movies at up to 180 x 136 pixels. The lens rotates so that you can use the
camera to take ordinary photos or self-portraits.
You can find out more about the LifeView FlyCAM-CF at the LifeView Web site
(www.lifeview.com).
Veo Photo Traveler for Pocket PC
Figure 20-5 shows the Veo Photo Traveler for Pocket PC. This camera attach-
ment is a bit simpler than the LifeView FlyCAM-CF. The Veo Photo Traveler
for Pocket PC doesn’t have a flash and its maximum resolution is 640 x 480
pixels. It does, however, have the ability to record short video segments.
You can find out more about the Veo Photo Traveler for Pocket PC at the Veo
Web site (www.veo.com).
Although both of the digital camera accessories that I tested require a CF slot,
HP now offers a similar unit that fits the SDIO slot on the iPAQs. Unfortunately,
however, the HP digital camera add-on wasn’t available for testing.

Powering Your Way to Freedom
This next accessory isn’t as cool or neat as some of the ones that I mention
earlier in this chapter, but it’s still something that no iPAQ user should be with-
out. iPAQs all run on batteries, and they’re automatically recharged whenever
your iPAQ is placed into the synchronization cradle (or, in the case of models
that don’t include the cradle, whenever the sync cable is connected). And
because iPAQs use very aggressive power management, an iPAQ runs a long
time in normal use — anywhere from five to ten hours — on a single charge.
Okay, so your iPAQ runs a long time on one charge, but that doesn’t mean
that it can run forever. Eventually, the batteries need to be recharged or your
iPAQ dies. And because you can’t just pop in a fresh set of batteries from the
drugstore, you have to bring your iPAQ home and place it into the synchro-
nization cradle for refueling.
Power from your car or laptop
So what does this have to do with a great iPAQ accessory? Simple: You need 
a second power adapter for your iPAQ so that you can charge up the batteries
no matter where you are. Here you have several choices. The most obvious is
to get a second AC adapter, but that may not be the best option. You can also
get adapters that plug into a cigarette lighter in a car. Alternatively, you might
look into getting a special type of cable that plugs into the USB port on any PC
and uses the power from the USB port to recharge your iPAQ. This type of
cable can also be used to sync your iPAQ with your laptop or desktop system,
but even if you only use it to grab some watts from a handy PC, it’s still a great
idea.
The units that I tested include the following:
 iBIZ Compaq Ipaq USB Charging/HotSync Kit: (www.ibizpda.com/pda_
accessories/pda_cables.html) This cable is as simple and compact
as can be. It has a standard USB plug on one end and a plug for the sync
jack on the bottom of your iPAQ on the other. Keep in mind, though, that
you need to plug the USB end directly into a desktop or laptop system —
a USB hub doesn’t work unless it has its own power supply.
 Belkin USB Sync Charger for iPAQ (Part number F8Q2000): (www.
belkin.com) This unit is similar to the iBIZ cable, but it includes one
important extra — a cigarette lighter adapter with a USB jack to provide
power from your car. This adapter takes up a bit more room than a simple
cable, of course, but it can be a real lifesaver when no PC is available.
317
Chapter 20: Ten Great iPAQ Accessories

 Griffin Mobile 3-in-1 Pocket PC Charger Kit: (www.griffinmobile.
com) I call this the boy scout model because when you have the Griffin
kit, you’re prepared for anything. This kit comes in its own slick little
case and has the USB charging cable, a cigarette lighter adapter, and an
AC adapter to cover every possible scenario. Note, though, that this kit
requires the charging adapter that came hanging off the end of your
iPAQ’s sync cable because it’s a universal type of kit (which also means
that you can use it to charge some other devices besides your iPAQ).
Power when you’re away from an outlet
Your iPAQ could be a great camping and hiking companion. It’s small, it can
entertain you, and it can help you navigate so that you don’t get lost. There’s
just one problem — when the battery in your iPAQ runs down, everything
stops working. And unless your idea of a great campsite is your own back-
yard, finding a place to plug in the iPAQ’s power adapter can be a real adven-
ture when you’re out camping.
Solar power for your iPAQ
One great solution is right there all around you — use the sun to power your
iPAQ. With the help of one of the really cool solar power units that I found,
you can sit out at a primitive campground for weeks and still be able to use
your iPAQ. Here are the details:
 POCKET-PAL Solar Charger: (www.aurorasolar.com) This solar charger
is a small, inexpensive, folding unit that fits into a space even smaller than
your iPAQ. In full sunlight, this unit can charge your iPAQ in a couple of
hours. It’s the perfect companion to an iPAQ with a CF GPS receiver. If
you go on a trip, you need to bring along the charging adapter that came
with your iPAQ to use the POCKET-PAL.
 iSun Portable Solar Charger: (www.icpglobal.com) This device is simi-
lar to the Pocket Pal unit, but it’s just a bit larger and slightly more power-
ful. The iSun unit includes a set of adapter plugs so that you can use it
with many different types of equipment. It’s unique in that several units
can be ganged together for higher output. Figure 20-6 shows how the iSun
portable solar charger looks when it’s open and ready to power your
iPAQ.
 SunCatcher Sport: (www.powerexperts.com) This unit is a bit larger and
more expensive than the other two units, but it also has some really nifty
features. The SunCatcher Sport uses its solar cells to charge a 1250-ma, 12-
volt battery, and this battery powers your iPAQ, cell phone, or whatever
318
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

else you want to plug into its cigarette lighter jack. The rechargeable bat-
tery also means that the Sun Catcher Sport can do something that few
solar cells can do — it can power your equipment even when the sun isn’t
out! Remember, though, that you need a 12-volt power cord that powers
your iPAQ from the cigarette lighter to use the SunCatcher Sport.
With one of these solar power units, you can travel anywhere and never worry
about finding the right electrical outlet to power your iPAQ. Nor do you have
to trail along several miles of extension cord when you go hiking or camping.

Extra batteries
Solar power for your iPAQ is a great idea, but what if you need to keep going
for a long time and can’t depend on having enough sun to give you the power
that you need? In that case, you may want to rely on some external battery
packs to get you through. I tested two of these that you may want to consider.
At the convenient end of the spectrum is the HP iPAQ Auxiliary Battery from
Innergy (www.pwrplant.com/PDA.html) shown in Figure 20-7. This unit is built
into a Targus leather case that can hold your iPAQ, and the unit is designed
to last about double the normal battery life. (Note, however, that this battery
pack is designed as a spare fuel tank for your iPAQ rather than as a battery
charger — the iPAQ’s charging light doesn’t come on when this battery pack
is attached.)

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

If you’re thinking of considerably more extreme conditions, Innergy offers
some really heavy-duty options, too. Figure 20-8 shows Innergy’s Force 10 bat-
tery pack, which is designed to keep your iPAQ running for days. This is a
serious battery pack that comes in its own backpack — it’s not what you’d
call a lightweight!
Emergency power packs
Have you ever considered that batteries must be made by Murphy and com-
pany? How else could you possibly explain the fact that batteries always
pick the absolute worst time to die. For example, suppose that you’re using
your iPAQ to give an important presentation to some potentially very big
customers — can you imagine a worse time for your iPAQ’s batteries to go
dead? And, of course, that is precisely the one time when you also forget to
bring the iPAQ’s power adapter.
One excellent way around this potential mess is to bring along some emer-
gency power in the form of one of the INSTANT POWER Chargers from
INSTANT POWER (www.instant-power.com). These ingenious devices 
Figure 20-8:
The Force 10
battery pack
is designed
for really
extreme
needs.
321
Chapter 20: Ten Great iPAQ Accessories

contain a special type of battery — known as a zinc-air battery — which
remains fresh and ready to use for years. Zinc-air batteries are activated by
opening the package and allowing air to enter the battery pack. Until they’re
opened, the battery simply sits there without going flat.
Each INSTANT POWER Charger has a disposable PowerCartridge that you can
replace after it’s used up. The PowerCartridge is good for about three complete
recharges of your iPAQ, and can be resealed to store any unused capacity for
up to three months.
Cases for Your iPAQ
Your iPAQ probably came with a simple little leather or vinyl case to protect
its screen when you slip it into your pocket. You’ve probably noticed, how-
ever, that although the case HP may have provided does protect your iPAQ, it
really leaves something to be desired in terms of utility and convenience. If
so, you may want to consider getting something that was designed with your
needs in mind.
Cases to fit your iPAQ come in all sorts of different styles. HP provides mini-
malist cases; some hard shell metal cases are designed to protect your iPAQ
from extreme conditions; and certain large, more elaborate cases can hold
your iPAQ, a cell phone, and even a quick change of clothes (if you pack light).
I know of a few great sources for cases to fit your iPAQ:
 MARWARE: (www.marware.com) This company makes several styles of
cases. Their cases tend to take a minimalist approach to pack the best
protection into the smallest size. I particularly like their SportSuit models
that can be fastened to your belt.
 Officeonthegogo: (www.officeonthegogo.com) On this site, you can
find the PDAPak — a case that has quite a few different pockets and
compartments so that you can bring along your iPAQ, your cell phone,
and any other assorted gadgets that you may need. The PDAPak also
has a number of optional strap configurations, so you’re sure to find a
comfortable way to carry whatever load you happen to pack in there.
 Seiko Instruments: (www.siibusinessproducts.com) The Seiko
SmartPad is an iPAQ case with a unique twist that no one else can match.
The SmartPad includes a digital pen that you can use to draw on an ordi-
nary pad of paper. Almost magically, whatever you draw on the paper
instantly appears on your iPAQ’s screen. If you want the coolest iPAQ
accessory around, the Seiko SmartPad is for you.
322

Mobile Mounts for More Convenience
If you’ve ever tried to use your iPAQ to help navigate while you were driving,
you no doubt realize that holding your iPAQ in one hand while you drive with
the other hand is not the best idea ever. Not only is it pretty difficult to do, but
it’s also pretty hard to explain when you run into the back end of a patrol car.
Some iPAQ-compatible GPS receiver kits include a vent mount kit in the pack-
age. Use this to mount the receiver on your air-conditioning vent so that it
doesn’t slide around on your dashboard.
The following are two sources of mobile mounts for your iPAQ:
 Pharos: (www.pharosgps.com) The PDA Holder is a clever little device
that clips to the air conditioning vent on your car’s dashboard or sticks
to your windshield with a suction cup (depending on the model that you
buy). This holder has two powerful magnets in the mount and a small
metal plate that sticks onto the back of your iPAQ. All of your iPAQ’s
ports remain usable when it’s sitting on the MagnaHolder, and the
magnet holds your iPAQ securely while allowing you to easily remove
your iPAQ when you park your car.
 Arkon Resources: (www.arkon.com) This company makes a number of
different mounts that can clip to your dash or stick to your windshield
by using suction cups. The various Arkon mobile mounts use a unique
system of spring-loaded, movable padded jaws to hold your iPAQ, and
they even include a handy stylus so that you don’t have to try getting the
one out of your iPAQ. If Arkon doesn’t have a mobile mount that works
in your vehicle, maybe it’s finally time to replace that horse-drawn cart.
Using Your iPAQ as a Radio
This next iPAQ accessory fits into a very specialized niche. The iBIZ
pocketRADIO (www.ibizpda.com) adds an FM radio tuner to your iPAQ (see
Figure 20-9). Sure, this probably makes your iPAQ into the most expensive
pocket radio ever, but it really is a handy add-on — especially when you want
a little respite from the noise around you. The included ear bud earphones do
a pretty good job of blocking outside sounds, and by using the ear buds you
don’t bother any of your neighbors. By the way, you need an iPAQ with a CF
slot to use the iBIZ pocketRADIO.

Controlling Your Life
If you don’t need this next accessory for your iPAQ, I’m sure that you
know someone who really does. The Griffin Mobile Total Remote (www.
griffinmobile.com) turns your iPAQ in a super remote control that can
replace virtually every infrared remote that currently clutters your family
room. Just think — no more pile of remote controls that no one knows how
to use.
Total Remote consists of two things: a powerful infrared transmitter module
that plugs into the headphone jack on your iPAQ, and a software application
that you can configure to control all sorts of devices from TVs to stereos. You
can even program a single tap to execute a whole series of commands.
The Total Remote plugs into a standard 3.5mm (1/8”) headphone jack. You
can use it with iPAQ models that have a 2.5mm jack (like the h1930/1935) by
using the adapter that comes packed with those models.

Connecting Your iPAQ to 
a Big Screen Display
Your iPAQ’s screen is simply too small to use when you want to give a presen-
tation to a group of people. Not even the people in the front row could read
your PowerPoint slide show (although for some of the PowerPoint shows I’ve
seen, that might be considered a blessing). If you’re going to show what’s on
your iPAQ’s screen to a crowd, you really need a bigger display.
Well, you could pass your iPAQ around the room, but that doesn’t make for a
very lively show, does it? Besides, what happens when the guy in the fifth row
decides that he wants to see what else this neat little gadget can do? There
goes your show.
A much better idea than trying to make everyone crowd around your iPAQ is
to send the show to something larger. The problem, of course, is that your
iPAQ doesn’t seem to have any way to connect to a bigger display. But as you
have no doubt guessed, I’ve found ways to correct this little problem.
Two different manufacturers make cards that fit your iPAQ and allow it to
output to a large display:
 Margi: (www.margi.com) The Presenter-to-Go is a handy little unit that
can display output from your iPAQ on a large screen monitor or through
a digital projector. The Presenter-to-Go comes with a business card-sized
infrared remote so that you can control the display from several feet away.
The Presenter-to-Go is available in both CF and SD form factors, so you
can find one to fit your iPAQ.
 Colorgraphic: (www.colorgraphic.net) The Voyager VGA CF works
very much like the Presenter-to-Go, although the Voyager VGA CF can
also be connected to a TV set for those times when a large monitor or
digital projector is unavailable. You do, however, need an iPAQ with a CF
slot to use the Voyager VGA CF.
If you want to display content from your iPAQ on your monitor, but don’t
want to spend a bunch of money on a piece of hardware, you might want to
consider downloading a copy of Remote Display Control for Pocket PC. This
free download, which you can find at www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/
resources/downloads/pocketpc/powertoys.mspx, is one of the Microsoft
PowerToys for the iPAQ. With the Remote Display Control, you can zoom the
iPAQ display on your monitor up to three times normal size — although
zooming doesn’t increase the resolution of the display so things might get a
bit blurry when you zoom in.

Ten Great iPAQ Business
Programs
In This Chapter
 Imaging
 Scheduling
 Keeping track of your finances
 Using maps and GPS systems
Your iPAQ is the most capable computer that has ever been able to fit
neatly into a pocket. Because your iPAQ is a real computer (and not just
a PDA), you can easily add new capabilities simply by installing some new
programs, and that makes the iPAQ an ideal business tool.
In this chapter, I show you some of the great business-oriented programs that
you can add to your iPAQ. It’s virtually impossible to choose the ten best busi-
ness programs for your iPAQ, though, so you should consider this chapter
to be a quick sampler rather than a list of my favorites. To be honest, it’s the
individual nature of the way that different people use their iPAQ that makes
this all so interesting. You may prefer some other choices rather than the
ones that I show here, but this gives you a place to start.
ACDSee Mobile
Many types of businesses use images for a number of different reasons. A real
estate agent might want to show customers views of interesting homes; a sales
person might want to carry along product images; and an artist might want to
keep samples of their work handy. In each of these cases, an iPAQ can be a
very convenient way to carry along a great assortment of digital images —
especially if you add the right software.

It’s true that some iPAQ models include image-viewing applications, but none
of these built-in programs can match the sheer versatility of a program like
ACDSee Mobile from ACD Systems (www.acdsystems.com). This program
(shown in Figure 21-1) allows you to find and view all the images on your iPAQ,
display those images singly or as a part of a slide show, and zoom in to the
images to examine small details. In addition, ACDSee Mobile easily handles a
wide range of image formats.
Developer One Agenda Fusion
If you use your iPAQ to help you keep track of a busy schedule, you probably
wish that you could see a bit more of your schedule at a quick glance. The
Developer One Agenda Fusion (www.developerone.com) makes this and a
number of other scheduling tasks far easier.
Figure 21-2 shows just one example of how Agenda Fusion improves your
scheduling options. Here, I’m able to view my agenda for today and also see
what tasks I have on the schedule for the rest of the week. In addition to
simply showing your schedule, Agenda Fusion can help you manage your
contacts, set alarms, and generally make keeping track of a busy life a whole
lot easier.

Handmark PDAStreetFinder
If you often travel for business, you know that having good maps and the loca-
tions of hotels and restaurants can be very important. You probably also know
that it can sometimes be difficult to find addresses in a strange city. A good
travel guide can be a real lifesaver. That’s where a program like the Handmark
PDAStreetFinder (www.handmark.com) shown in Figure 21-3 shines.
Handmark PDAStreetFinder has a very easy-to-use desktop application that
includes the ratings and descriptions from the Mobile Travel Guide. After you
select the area that you want to see, you can easily export both the map and
selected listings to your iPAQ.
Ilium eWallet
You probably have a wallet full of credit cards, a driver’s license, and various
other pieces of identification that you need for doing business. If you’ve ever
lost your wallet, you know the danger of keeping all your valuable informa-
tion in one place. That’s where a program like Ilium’s eWallet comes in handy
(www.iliumsoft.com). As Figure 21-4 shows, you can safely store all sorts of
important information in eWallet.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

You may be wondering how storing credit card numbers and identification
documents in eWallet protects all that sensitive information. After all, what
happens if someone steals your iPAQ? Will they be able to go on a giant shop-
ping spree with your credit cards? Well, rest assured. The information that
you store in eWallet is password protected, and unless you put your password
on a sticky note stuck to your iPAQ, your credit card numbers are safe.
Ilium Keep Track
When maintaining financial records, it can be difficult to keep track of every
transaction — especially if you find yourself short on cash and need to make
a quick withdrawal at an ATM or if you use your debit card to buy some gas. It’s
even harder to remember all these things if you transfer funds over the phone
because you probably don’t have any printed receipt to remind you later.
That’s where Ilium’s Keep Track (see Figure 21-5) really shines (www.
iliumsoft.com). This handy little program makes quick work of keeping 
a record of all those transactions so that you don’t get any nasty surprises
when you go to balance your checkbook.

Chapter 21: Ten Great iPAQ Business Programs

Ilium ListPro
The idea behind a list is really simple, but that doesn’t change the fact that
lists are awfully handy. For example, Figure 21-6 shows how a building con-
tractor might use Ilium ListPro to make certain that all the necessary materi-
als were ordered for a jobsite.
One very handy feature of ListPro is that you can download a whole bunch
of free lists from the Ilium Web site (www.iliumsoft.com) so that you don’t
have to create all your lists from scratch.
Pocket Quicken
Pocket Quicken (see Figure 21-7) from LandWare (www.landware.com) is an
absolute essential for any people who use their iPAQs for business purposes
and use Quicken on their desktop PCs. This program provides seamless, two-
way financial data exchanges between your iPAQ and the version of Quicken
on your desktop system. (Microsoft Money for Pocket PC can only import
Quicken data — it can’t have a two-way exchange.)
Figure 21-6:

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Microsoft Money
If you prefer to use Microsoft Money on your desktop system, you would no
doubt prefer Microsoft Money for Pocket PC (see Figure 21-8) on your iPAQ.
In either case, the essential point to remember is that the desktop application
and the application on your iPAQ must match if you want to automatically
share information back and forth between the two.
You can probably find a copy of Microsoft Money for Pocket PC on the
Microsoft Money CD, or you can download it for free from the Windows
Mobile Web site (www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/resources/
downloads/pocketpc/money.mspx).
EZ-Expense
Although Pocket Quicken and Microsoft Money for Pocket PC are obvious
choices for users of the associated desktop applications, EZ-Expense (see
Figure 21-9) from Soft Pocket Solutions (www.softpocketsolutions.com)
may be a better choice if you use a different method of tracking your business
expenses (such as an Excel spreadsheet or a corporate accounting system).
Although both of the other two programs are designed to work with a specific
desktop accounting package, EZ-Expense allows you to export the data from
your iPAQ as an Excel file.

TeleType GPS Pro
The final program that I mention here is considerably different from the others
in this chapter, but bringing it up serves to give you a better idea of just how
many divergent business-related functions your iPAQ can perform given the
right application. In Chapter 19, I show you how you could use a GPS receiver
along with your iPAQ to help you find your way. But the TeleType GPS Pro soft-
ware can also serve a very useful business purpose in tracking the location of
company vehicles.
Real-time tracking requires a live connection (such as a wireless Internet
connection). You can find out more about the necessary equipment at the
TeleType Web site (www.teletype.com/pages/tracking.html).

Ten Great Ways to Have 
Fun with Your iPAQ
In This Chapter
 Restaurant and wine recommendations
 Games
 Music players
S
ure, you bought your iPAQ as a business tool, but that doesn’t mean you
can’t have some fun with it, too. Your iPAQ is a real computer, and that
means it’s quite capable of serving many different purposes. At least one (or
ten) of those purposes should be getting a bit of enjoyment.
In this chapter, I present a sampler of ten different ways to enjoy your iPAQ.
You can choose which of them suits your lifestyle the best.
Pocket Gourmet
Everyone has to eat, of course, but some people get a lot of enjoyment out of
great food experiences. If you’re one of those people who really likes to eat,
though, you know that sometimes dining out can be a bit more of an experi-
ence than you planned on — especially if you aren’t an expert on every little
esoteric term that might be used on a menu.
That’s where a program like Pocket Gourmet from neohand (www.neohand.
com) can really help. This program has a menu assistant that describes
exactly what those strange terms mean (see Figure 22-1). Pocket Gourmet
also has a feature that enables you to make notes about restaurants so that
you can remember why you don’t want to go back to Billy Bob’s Sushi and
Bait Shack. Pocket Gourmet also has a tip calculator.

Pocket Vineyard
To many people, nothing is better than pairing the right wine with a good
meal. Sometimes, though, choosing the proper wine can be somewhat intimi-
dating. Your iPAQ can once again come to the rescue when you install Pocket
Vineyard from neohand (www.neohand.com).
As Figure 22-2 shows, Pocket Vineyard acts as your personal wine steward.
You can check to see what you can expect from a particular vintage (and this
is broken down into very specific locales), see definitions of various wine-
related terms, and even get recommendations for the types of wines to con-
sider with specific types of food.
Monopoly
Is there anyone who didn’t spend hours playing Monopoly when they were
growing up? It’s hard to imagine that such a person exists because the 
game has always been so popular. With the iPAQ version of Monopoly from
Handmark (www.handmark.com) shown in Figure 22-3, you can relive those
days any time you want.

Chapter 22: Ten Great Ways to Have Fun with Your iPAQ

Tetris
Tetris is one of those maddening games that can easily get you hooked. It’s a
classic computer game, and you can get a copy for your iPAQ in the Tetris
Classic Game Pak from Handmark (www.handmark.com). Figure 22-4 shows
how the game appears shortly after it begins.
Be sure to choose Tools➪Buttons so that you can find out how to control the
game — Tetris is played with the buttons on the front of your iPAQ rather than
with the stylus.
Pocket Gambler
Pocket Gambler from ZIO (www.ziointeractive.com) is one of those rare pro-
grams that can easily pay for itself by keeping you from gambling with real
money. It does so by letting you play any of seven different casino games on
your iPAQ (see Figure 22-5), and you never have to worry about emptying
your bank account.
As the figure shows, Pocket Gambler switches your iPAQ into landscape mode
and uses the entire screen for game play. This program offers some of the best
graphics that I’ve seen on an iPAQ. I only wish that I could make it pay my
winnings!

Scrabble
If you prefer a slightly more intellectual pursuit, Scrabble from Handmark may
be your game. This game requires you to make words by placing tiles on the
board (see Figure 22-6). Unlike the actual board game, though, there’s no risk
of losing the game tiles when one player gets frustrated and tosses the board
across the room.

Chapter 22: Ten Great Ways to Have Fun with Your iPAQ

You can play Scrabble against another human player by passing your iPAQ
back and forth, but if they have their own PDA, you can choose the option to
beam the game before play begins. Scrabble runs on any Pocket PC (not just
iPAQs) as well as on Palms.
Pocket Player
It’s time to shift focus in a different direction. The Pocket Player from Conduits
(www.conduits.com) is an excellent alternative to the Windows Media Player
that comes on your iPAQ. Pocket Player (shown in Figure 22-7) offers some
very interesting features that you can’t find in Windows Media Player. My
favorite feature is the graphic equalizer that enables you to tailor the play-
back to suit your needs. For example, you can boost the middle frequencies
to bring out the words in a vocal that you’re having trouble understanding.
Or, you can cut those same frequencies to hide the vocals if you want to use
your iPAQ for karaoke.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Pocket Artist
I’d guess that most graphic artists probably prefer to work on a screen that’s
somewhat larger than the one on an iPAQ. But even so, at times being able to
modify an image directly on your iPAQ could be awfully handy (or just plain
fun). For example, Figure 22-8 shows an image that’s open in Conduits Pocket
Artist (www.conduits.com). I don’t know about you, but I have a whole bunch
of ideas for thought balloons that I’d like to add to that picture!
The Conduits Web site offers free 30-day trial versions of a number of programs
that you may want to try on your iPAQ.
Vindigo
My iPAQ can without a doubt help me enjoy traveling. With a service like
Vindigo (see Figure 22-9), I can find the best places to eat, shop, and visit
when I’m on the road. And because Vindigo is a service, the information is
constantly being updated so I’m not likely to waste my time trying to find
that cool-sounding restaurant that closed a month ago but is still listed in
the local phone directory.

You can discover more about Vindigo and view a demo at their Web site

PocketChess
This final entry in the “have fun with your iPAQ” category is a bit different
from the other applications that I mention in this chapter. PocketChess is a
part of the Handmark Tetris Classic Game Pak (www.handmark.com) but
somehow it seems like a world apart from something as frantic as Tetris.
PocketChess demands serious contemplation if you want to have a satisfying
game — especially if you set your iPAQ’s skill level high enough in the pro-
gram’s settings.
Figure 22-10 shows the beginning of a game of PocketChess. You can play
against your iPAQ, against a human opponent, or if you’re a real sadist, you
can have your iPAQ play both sides.

Ten Great iPAQ Utilities
In This Chapter
 Antivirus software
 Remote controls
 Registry editors and utilites
You might be excused if you think of utilities as the “miscellaneous” cate-
gory of iPAQ applications. These types of programs fulfill a rather broad
range of functions — some of which may have you wondering if they’re any-
thing that you would ever find a use for. Well, that’s okay; the point of this
chapter is really just to give you some ideas about how capable your iPAQ can
be given a bit of imagination. So sit back, enjoy, and see what your iPAQ can
do with the addition of the proper utility program.
Airscanner Mobile AntiVirus Pro
It’s an unfortunate fact that computer viruses not only exist but can be a great
danger to your data. The sick people who create these viruses don’t really
care if they cause you great damage or that you’ve never done anything to
them; all they care about is being evil.
Airscanner Mobile AntiVirus Pro (see Figure 23-1) is a program that’s designed
to protect your iPAQ from various types of threats including viruses and
Trojan horses — programs that aren’t what they claim to be and often cause
damage.
You can download Airscanner Mobile AntiVirus Pro from Airscanner’s Web
site (www.airscanner.com). It’s currently free for non-commercial use.
Corporate, educational, government, and small business/home office users
must purchase an annual license within 30 days of installing it.

Symantec AntiVirus for Handhelds
I would like to mention another antivirus option that you may want to consider.
Symantec AntiVirus for Handhelds (see Figure 23-2) is an antivirus applica-
tion for your iPAQ that comes from one of the big names in PC protection.
If you really depend on the data that you store on your iPAQ, you may be a bit
more comfortable with Symantec’s antivirus solution because it offers both
automatic protection and the Symantec LiveUpdate feature. However, you do
have to weigh these features against the higher cost and the fact that Symantec
AntiVirus for Handhelds is sold on a yearly subscription basis. You can check
out the Symantec Web site at www.symantec.com.
pocketWiNc
The next utility to look at is pocketWiNc from Cirond (www.cirond.com). This
is by far the best tool for helping you find and connect to Wi-Fi access points
and hotspots. With Wi-Fi capabilities either built into or available through a
Wi-Fi adapter card for any iPAQ, pocketWiNc gives you far more information
than the so-called “zero configuration utility” that’s built into Windows Mobile
2003 (see Figure 23-3). Sure, the built-in utility often tells you if a Wi-Fi signal
is available, but it doesn’t tell you important information about what type (if
any) of security is in use. Without this information, you can waste time trying
Figure 23-1:

348

to connect to a site that’s not really available for your use. pocketWiNc has a
free trial version, and you need to pay to continue using it after the trial
expires.

Chapter 23: Ten Great iPAQ Utilities

Nevo Remote Control
Nevo is a remote control program that’s available on some iPAQ models. It’s
designed to replace the pile of remotes (the ones that likely clutter your
coffee table) by allowing you to use one device — your iPAQ — to control
everything. You simply add the devices (like your TV or stereo) that are in
each room, and then use your iPAQ in place of the remotes for those devices
(see Figure 23-4).
You can download updates and a user manual from the Nevo Web site (www.
mynevo.com). Unfortunately, you cannot add Nevo if your iPAQ doesn’t already
include it.
Nevo appears on the Start menu if it is installed on your iPAQ, but it does not
appear in the Programs folder.
Total Remote
Okay, so you think that Nevo sounds like a great idea, but you don’t find it
when you tap the Start button on your iPAQ — what are you supposed to do?
Are you doomed to be buried under a mound of orphan remote controls or is
there hope for the poor iPAQ user who lacks Nevo?
Figure 23-4:
Nevo

your iPAQ to

350
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Actually, in some ways you might be better off if your iPAQ doesn’t include
Nevo because then you won’t feel bad about buying a copy of Total Remote
from Griffin Mobile (www.griffinmobile.com). As Figure 23-5 shows, Total
Remote turns your iPAQ into an extremely capable remote control that has all
the controls you need. What the figure cannot show is that Total Remote can
learn new commands and you can even program a series of commands that
execute with a single tap.
Total Remote has another feature that really puts it into a class of its own. The
package includes a high-powered infrared radiation module that can control
devices like your TV from up to 100 feet away. Imagine the fun that you could
have by programming in the codes for your neighbor’s TV!
PHM Registry Editor
PHM Registry Editor is one of those programs that no one would mistake for
anything other than a utility. It’s a serious tool that enables you to do things
that are otherwise nearly impossible to do, such as examining and modifying
the Registry in your iPAQ (see Figure 23-6).
Figure 23-5:
Total

351
Chapter 23: Ten Great iPAQ Utilities

This isn’t a tool for the faint of heart: Modifying the Registry incorrectly can
do serious damage. In fact, it’s possible to mess up so severely that your only
choice is to do a hard reset (which conveniently wipes out all your data and
any programs that you installed).
If you’re willing to accept the responsibility of using PHM Registry Editor
wisely (or at least not blaming anyone else if you mess up), you can find out
more about the program at www.phm.lu/Products/PocketPC/RegEdit/.
The author of the program, Philippe Majerus, provides free downloads at this
Web site.
vxUtil
vxUtil is another of those pure utility programs (and another of the free
ones). It includes a number of very useful functions that can help you figure
out what is going wrong when you are experiencing networking problems.
Figure 23-7 gives you an idea of all the different features that are available in
this program.
You can download a free copy of the vxUtil program from the Cambridge
Computer Corporation Web site (www.cam.com/vxutil_pers.html).

Use the Info function in vxUtil to determine the current IP address of your
iPAQ and various other related pieces of information.
X-Lite
X-Lite from Xten (www.xten.com/index.php?menu=products&smenu=xlite&
ssmenu=download) is another free utility that may be of interest to many iPAQ
users. X-Lite (see Figure 23-8) is a program that enables you to make free calls
over broadband Internet connections. (This is also known as VOIP — voice-
over IP.) This free utility works in conjunction with the free service called
Free World Dialup (www.pulver.com/fwd/).
Currently, you are limited to calling other Free World Dialup users, but there’s
no reason why your friends and relatives can’t sign up, too. Just think: You
could call a friend halfway around the world while you sit in that Wi-Fi–enabled
coffee shop, and it wouldn’t cost you a dime!
Be sure to download the Auto-Config “Free World Dialup” version of X-Lite.
That way, you don’t have to deal with the somewhat confusing configuration
options that are necessary to set up your account.

Pocket Slides from Conduits (www.conduits.com) is a program that enables
you to display PowerPoint presentations on your iPAQ. So what’s the big
deal about that, you ask? Well, a couple of things make it a big deal (and an
extremely useful utility to have on your iPAQ). First, no version of PowerPoint
exists for the iPAQ, so you need a third-party program like Pocket Slides to
even show your PowerPoint presentation. Second, although other PowerPoint
viewers do exist for you iPAQ, Pocket Slides has the added feature of allowing
you to modify your presentation right on your iPAQ. Third — and this is a big
one — Pocket Slides can handle huge PowerPoint presentations that every
other iPAQ PowerPoint viewer I tested simply chokes on. For example, Figure
23-9 shows one of 631 slides in a 225MB PowerPoint slideshow that I created
for a Holabird American auction (www.holabird.org). No other PowerPoint
application for the iPAQ could load this slideshow because of its size.
Pocket Slides is completely compatible with the Margi Presenter-to-Go (www.
margi.com). The combination of these two utilities enables you to bring along
your PowerPoint presentation without lugging a laptop and without worrying
about whether you can find a compatible PC.

allows you
to make free
calls over
the Internet
from your
iPAQ.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Really huge Pocket Slides presentations like the one that I did for the auction
don’t need to be transferred to a storage card by using ActiveSync. You can
save time by transferring the file directly to the storage card by using some-
thing like a SanDisk card reader (www.sandisk.com).
Adobe Acrobat Reader
Adobe Acrobat is one of the most popular document formats for one very
good reason: Documents that are in the PDF format can be viewed on virtu-
ally any type of computer (if it has a version of the Acrobat Reader) and still
retain their original appearance. (PDF stands for Portable Document Format.)
The Adobe Acrobat Reader for Pocket PC (see Figure 23-10) is a free utility
that enables your iPAQ to view PDF documents.
You can download the Acrobat Reader from the Adobe Web site (www.adobe.
com). Be sure to download the version that’s listed as being for the iPAQ.
(Don’t worry that Windows Mobile 2003 isn’t listed; the version that’s avail-
able works just fine.)

Slides is the
best iPAQ
PowerPoint
utility that
I’ve found.
